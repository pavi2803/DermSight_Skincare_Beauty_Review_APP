1,tula,protect + glow daily sunscreen gel broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2016249,2562776," * Gosh I love that it has clean ingredients but its like rubbing oatmeal covered in oil on your skin. It just sits like a layer of grease on your face. I want to love because of the clean ingredients but it's just not a usable product. * This product when I first applied it, it feels like cottage cheese (which is fine) just something I noticed. When you rub it it in looks okay(very greesy and shinny) as the day goes on it will start to peel. I would touch my face and the sunscreen would come off on my finger. I bought it on 8/21 and am returning it as I write this on 8/22. * First time using was on a day i mowed my lawn so i thought maybe that caused the skin around my eyes to sting, burn, dry out & peel. After a weeklong battle to get my skin healthy again, i used this sunscreen again with the same results but worse...burning, stinging, dried skin near my eyes especially but all over my face that will now take at least a week to return to healthy by peeling off. Never again. * This sunscreen has been a repeat for several years now. It's the only sunscreen that doesn't make me look ashy or oily. I have darker skin that is acne prone and this has been my Holy Grail. 

It gives me a beautiful glow while still offering protection. I love it. I can also use it with make out or alone for a flawless glow. 

My only con people be the smell, since it's a clean product, I noticed that there is a slight smell to it. Not horrible but it's there. It seems to fade after a while. * This product has become part of my daily routine when I go out. Feels super light on my skin and looks great under makeup. Never have an issue with this sunscreen and this is my fourth time purchasing. Just wish it wasnt so expensive. * I do like this moisturizing sunscreen. Pairs well with all my other products! * This was always my go to. I loved it until recently. Half way through my 3rd bottle and the sunscreen now has a different consistently and is pilling everytime. It's not expired and was not expecting this especially for the price. Won't be repurchasing and would not recommend."
2,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen spf 40,pimprod2029930,2589386," * I like this product didnt really have a problem with it, its just that i dont like how it feels on my skin. As someone with combination skin it would leave a matteish finish but after a few minutes i wouldn't see that matteiah finish and my glow would comeback. Some people like that glowy look but its just not for me because of my skin type and my preference. Good product just not for me. * I like this product didnt really have a problem with it, its just that i dont like how it feels on my skin.

Some people like that glowy look but its just not for me because of my skin type and my preference. Good product just not for me. * The Ulta Unseen Sunscreen SPF 50 which I received complimentary from Supergoop feels like a primer yet has the protection of a sunscreen.  I love it because it is beneficial for my skin as it diminishes pores and allows for smoother makeup application.   The formula is unique and stands out because of its performance.   I highly recommend especially for traveling and busy days. * This is my all time favorite sunscreen. It is so great for everyday and using underneath makeup. It doesnt pill or change the texture of my makeup. Its weightless and it doesnt leave a white cast. Obsessed! Gifted by supergoop * It's good, just not worth money or intrigues me anymore. Burns eyes, makes skin slightly irritated. Wouldn't buy because there's better for sale out there. * I really like this sunscreen. I buy this size, because I think it is too expensive. * i've struggled with finding a face sunscreen for decades. i'll never look elsewhere. feels so good when it goes on (smooth!) and disappears instantly. isn't shiny, isn't matte, doesn't have any sort of cast. no weird smell. makes a great base for makeup and washes off easily."
3,la roche-posay,anthelios uv correct spf 70 daily face sunscreen with niacinamide,pimprod2030180,2591831," * I like it for most part... but if you sweat, or rub your eyes, it burns for a really long time. * I purchased this product three times. The first time was great i fell in love instantly, it was greasy, it dried down beautifully and it was great under makeup. Not to mention 70SPF?? Heck ye! So i bought it a second time and i used it for the first few months no problem, and then my eyes started to water..not sting, just water. And i thought hm well thats weird cant be my sunscreen cause ive been using it with no issues, and i was running out so i think purchased my third and final bottle and oh my gods when i tell yall my eyes BURNED. Within the first month of purchasing my third bottle i had to constantly wash my face because i couldnt keep my eyes open. But again, it couldnt have been the sunscreen right?? So for the next weeks i isolated my skincare products and all were perfectly fine…except for this sunscreen. By this time it was too late to return it so in the trash it sadly went. Ive never been so heartbroken, if they changed their formula or if my skin just got allergic to it over time i dont know. Im on the search for a new perfect sunscreen, wish me luck. * I have oily to combination skin and this product is not sweat proof or water proof as stated in the description. I will say this product did correct my darkspots and protected my skin. The lotion does need to be rubbed in and does peel after the second hour but the protection is present. I can only wear inside my house due to it being hot and me being sweaty. * It burned my eyes. I didn't put around eye area. I really wanted to love this spf 70, but it was too hard to work with. left face drier than before I put it on. I had to return it. * I wish I could love this product more; unfortunately, every time I apply this product it would irritate my eyes. Of course, I tried to avoid eye area, but still a few minutes after the application, my eyes would be irritated. If you have sensitive eyes, I would not recommend it. * This sunscreen is sheer and I like it very much. Sadly, it's one that creeps up into my eyes and burns. * This is a hard review to write because in a lot of ways its exactly what I'm looking for: moisturizing, has spf, gentle. The big reason I wouldn't buy it again is it melts into my eyes and stings terribly. Ive actually had to pull off the road barely able to keep my eyes open another second with a waterful of tears (product induced— not weeping) making the whole situation worse. It must not happened to everyone, which is why I gave it for stars. It just doesn't work for me."

5,vacation,classic whip spf 30 sunscreen mousse,pimprod2033019,2596247," * I have acne prone skin and this broke me out, it WILL clog your pores over time. its a cool concept and the overall texture is good for dry skin but theres not a lot of product in the bottle. * i use it on my face and it makes my skin feel greasy and ive been getting small break outs on my t-zone since ive started using this. it feels great on the body though * Although it does provide adequate sun protection (I'm extremely pale), the gimmick is just not worth it.  It ran out after maybe less than 10 full body applications, and I had this same issue with their glow version as well.  I can get other sunscreens for the same price that'll last me the whole summer, not just a week. * feels great on the skin and wears even better under makeup. 10/10 * I love this sunscreen! It is such fun packaging but also my favorite body sunscreen because of how great it works! It feels so nice, goes on super smoothly, isn't oily, doesn't leave a white cast, and it smells so nice! * I'll admit, I purchased this sunscreen solely because of the packaging—and it turned out to be incredible. The texture is unique and easy to apply. I also love the smell. 

To everyone saying it made their eyes water or irritated the skin on their face, please know that it is intended for the BODY. The company advises against using it on the face—neck down only and you'll be just fine. xo * Yeah…. I definitely ""applied"" common sense and used only on my body, but unless you wanna risk your face to a breakout or some other sensitive reaction go for it!"
6,kopari beauty,sunglaze sheer body mist sunscreen spf 42,pimprod2043793,2618935," * Strong sent and the sprayer broke the 3rd time using it really sucks * Makes your skin feel so soft and hydrated after you use! * Is this product good for acnea prone skin to use on the face? If so, I would buy again. * I wore this out boating. It is stunning, the more you use the sparkler you get. In the sun it's so, so pretty. Feels good, beautiful mister, smells nice. That being said, I used this as my only SPF and I am pretty crispy. I reapplied multiple times, so I shouldn't be burnt. I would recommend as a topper, but use in conjunction with another SPF * Wanted to badly to love this. I have lost 90% of this product thanks to the awful bottle design. The top slips right off even though it's screwed on. It's too expensive for such poor package quality. I am beyond disappointed. I am usually a Kopari ride or die. * Totally disappointed with this product. Sprayer broken and leaked inside the shipping box. small amount of product for the price. I gave it a ""2"" because it smells good. I will not purchase again. * This has got to be one of the most god-awful things I've ever smelled. Keep in mind, I'm pregnant, but DEAR LORD, the smell is horrendous."
7,supergoop!,on-the-go spf duo,pimprod2044871,2623031, * buy this now and throw it in your purse for the summer! this is the best sunscreen. a little bit goes a long way and it's so light weight! * Loved this sunscreen
8,supergoop!,play everyday lotion spf 50 with sunflower extract pa++++,pimprod2030629,2589403," * Im not dirw why more people don't mention what a great facial sunscreen this is.  Not only does it work and protect my skin from the sun, it leaves a slight dewy look all day but not oily! I use it over my moisturizer and them add a little blush and its a perfect no makeup look. Love this ans price is so reasonable. I have sensitive skin and do not breakout with this. * The way this product has a chokehold on me! I slather myself in SPF from head to toe every morning and before any outdoor activities, but could never find a suncreen that didnt get all over my clothes or smell like sunscreen. This product is perfect! It absorbs SO WELL that I put it on before getting dressed and it doesnt rub onto my clothes. It also has a very light and fresh scent that is actually enjoyable. I purchase this in every size so I always have one on me, but the pump is great for the bathroom counter! * Skin irritation occured after using this product. I didn't even want to give it one star! It has some sort of scent, citrus maybe in the product, but doesn't specify that anywhere om the packaging. Wouldn't recommend this product to anyone! * I love this sunscreen and love that it comes in this big jug. I don't understand why all other brands only have small sizes when we are suppose to use a good amt daily. I love that there is nonwhite cast. It blends into my skin and although it's pricey I do t have to buy sunscreen every other week now. * Not fungal acne safe 
Smaller than expected 
No white cast * The best body sunscreen I've ever used. I have very pale skin and burn easily. I applied and reapplied this sunscreen before being at the beach for hours and didnt burn at all. * I'm new to sunscreens and have been on the hunt for one that has PA++++ without a white caste that does not sting my eyes, and this one is it! Also smells great as well. A little expensive, but worth it."
9,la roche-posay,anthelios melt-in milk body & face sunscreen lotion spf 100,pimprod2013150,2559778," * I do not recommend it, the product melts very quickly and falls on the eyes which irritates and on the lips where its flavor remains. The skin looks very oily. * My skin will break out pretty quickly when it comes to sunscreen. I'm able to wear this sunscreen daily and I have never experienced a breakout. I also work outside in 100° weather and my face has never burnt while wearing this product ♥️ * I have used this product with two different moisturizers and it keeps flaking off. I use it after washing my face and applying a light layer of moisturizer. My eyes also burn after applying it. * Both myself and my husband used this before going to the pool today and both of our eyes burned so badly! Even a while after washing my face really good they still burn. * Bought before going to FL for a few weeks. My porcelain skin did not burn at all! It absorbed quickly, did not cause me to breakout, did not leave my skin greasy and worked well under makeup. I used it on my face, ears, neck and arms and it worked great for me. Just be careful putting it near your eyes, it burned like crazy later in the day. Highly recommend this product! * I tried this sunblock once on my face and my skin was burning and left red marks on my face. Apparrently it's phototoxic and can cause chemical burns. Def don't recommend for sensitive skin. * It feels ""runny"" in the sense that it is so lightweight and blendable, But is not too liquidity. So far, I have been able to comfortably, use it as moisturizer, or with moisturizer, perfectly without Make-Up, and it also wears well under a full face."
10,vacation,orange gelÃ©e spf 30 sunscreen gel,pimprod2044868,2623026," * Used a 1/8th of a teaspoon of the gel on each arm. THREE hours later, and it still hasn't absorbed. My arms feel tacky, like when I first applied the gel. I can  wipe my arm with a paper napkin, and see an oily spot like I just wiped off lip balm. * Really close to the Bain de Soleil #4 tanning gellé. Higher spf which is a plus. Protect & tan! The scent is not the same but I can overlook that since it's a great dupe. My favorite to use while in the sun. * Although the consistency and color are spot on, this smells NOTHING like the original Bain de Soleil orange gelee I used back in the early 70s.  RETURNED. * ...And I was not mad about it. When I first purchased this, the smell and difficult texture admittedly threw me off, but on the skin it is divine(the smell in the bottle is not indicative of how it smells once on the skin). The granular texture rubs in and in warmer weather, the product gets softer/spreads across skin far easier. My skin not only looked radiant, it felt very well conditioned and I did not burn(pool day, high UV index, reapplied about every 20 minutes). I was somewhat scared this would aggravate my skin, but it conditioned it so well. However, if you are uncomfortable with thick body products or sticky/waxy feelings, I would not recommend. * Guys it's so bad. I was obsessed with the original as a teen, but spf 4 just isn't enough and I was so excited to try this re-release. The original scent is like a core memory for me. 
But this new one smells so awful. My husband described it as ""high school urinal"" 
Awful awful awful. I couldn't get it off fast enough. * I don't know how this is so popular. The jelly is granular, it does not smell good and the container leaked everywhere after it was opened. Terrible product! * I love the thickness of this and how it resisted me sweating in the Florida sun. It gave a nice sheen and has a pleasant scent. It also stayed in place when I would briefly dip in the ocean."

14,vacation,super spritz spf50 face mist,pimprod2038618,2606383," * burns and stings my eyes so bad. doesnt feel nice on the skin either * I've been on the hunt all summer for a spray on SPF to go over my make up that doesn't leave me oily or greasy. This is not that one. I already have combination skin so I definitely don't need help in the dewy department. I sprayed this once over my make up to re-apply my SPF and I was in office in my freezing cubicle but we have massive windows that face me so I like to re-apply even if I don't go outside. First off the nozzle does not spray evenly and left some big splotches on my face and second I immediately felt the oily slick feeling all over. Literally ruined my make up and had to go try and blot as much off as I could considering I still had about 6 hours left of my work day. Never used it again smh. * First time I used this, it burned my face horribly as I sprayed it on. I was freaked out, but I tried it a second time and nothing happened. It makes the face really greasy though. * buy this if you love to torture your eyeballs!!!! * This sunscreen burns my eyes. I like the smell and it feels fine on my skin, BUT my eyes can't handle it. * I guess I'm extremely spoiled by KBeauty SPF products that you can safely use all around the eye area. I was cautious with this and shielded my eyes but it's extremely greasy and migrated into my eyes within minutes. I tried it without makeup and I don't think it would play well over makeup, especially if you're combo/oily. * I love this sunscreen. I live in Texas so sweatproof, makeup friendly, easy to reapply spf is very important and this one ticks all the boxes. Doesn't sting my eyes so I can use it hands free!  *chefs kiss*"

I think this would be great for dry skin only. However, i love how it looks under makeup * Odor free, applies on the skin smoothly ,does not leave residue ,does not roll ,feels very natural .I have been using it for 2 weeks and highly recommend the product.Most definitely will buy it again. * I love this brand but this produnt make my face look so oily and greasy. * I have sensitive skin and one of the main reasons I purchased this sunscreen was because it was suitable for sensitive skin. Its not. Although I do love rhe texture and it does leave no white cast and is hydrating, it emphasized redness on my cheeks and thats where im more sensitive. I did see notice little breakouts since I started using this sunscreen.  Will be returning. * I wanted to like this due the price and reviews were good. For me, it just sits on top of my skin. All day. Long. Very greasy and gives my face an unwelcomed sheen. * I loved Ulta and have been a huge fan. Unfortunately with this order I've taken a step back. I paid over double the price I should have paid. I didn't get the discount bc they were out of stock and never said anything except it was canceled. * I did order 2 and one the caps were missing but idk💀"

18,cerave,hydrating mineral sunscreen face lotion with sheer tint spf 30,pimprod2013299,2559459," * After trying this product for a while, I ended up liking it a lot. I like that it feels light weight and not thick. And it feels nice on the skin and not sticky. The packaging is average , but the smell if a little strong.  And it had good SPF protection. * The CeraVe Hydrating Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 Face Sheer Tint is a tinted sunscreen that gives your skin a nice glow in addition to protecting your skin from the sun's UVA and UVB rays. It does not leave a white residue or ""white cast"" that some sunscreens leave. Only downside is that the residue or tint may wear off on clothing if your face touches your shirt like when you're taking your shirt off, especially shirts that are white. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I have been using the dark shade on my fair to medium skin. It works as the perfect bronzer and protection. I've actually received many compliments on the way my skin looks with this on. There is no strong smell and it comes in a conveniently sized bottle. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This tinted sunscreen is overall pretty good. I tend to like chemical sunscreens more but for a mineral one it's really nice. You definitely need to pay attention to the color of the product based on your skin tone because like all mineral sunscreens there's a bit of a caste. I'm really pale so it was fine, but if you have a darker skin tone I would definitely patch test. But it applies well and isn't heavy at all. CeraVe is always so gentle so if you have sensitive skin this is definitely worth a try. * Great sunscreen.  I only had to reapply once because I was in the sun al day.  It went on nice and smooth and streak free.  The only downside was that it left some residue on the collar of my son's white shirt.   It did come of easily.   There was no strong scent.  The mineral ingredients were perfect for my son's sensitive skin. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This is more of a full coverage foundation than a sunscreen. It was super greasy and would get worse throughout the day. My skin broke out from using this product for a week. I wanted to love it as it was a great foundation/sunscreen but it was just way too greasy! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] It has SPF 30 and it also brights up my skin without leaving a residue. Not too greasy considering it's a sunscreen but it's definitely on the more oil side. No scent and no coverage."
19,sun bum,travel size sunscreen lotion spf 30,pimprod2014602,2564527," * Definitely the best drugstore sunscreen I reach for! Been using this since 2022 and I reach for it when I'm going on long hikes and reapply again. 

I love the smell of coconut and tropical vanilla. It's not too overbearing. 

But the best part of the sunscreen is that it doesn't leave a white cast. Don't apply too much at a time and give it time to blend in and settle before applying a little more. * The product is so wonderful. I love it so much. * It gets watery and no matter how much i shake it, it wont fix * This is good but it will make your face fill extremely oily. * it was very lightweight and had a very good tropical smell, but it is a bit small for the price * smells great, peels really bad even with nothing under or on top of it. * it pills wouldnt buy agajn"
20,supergoop!,mineral mattescreen spf 40,pimprod2029941,2589388," * Non-greasy. It's matte and it makes your complexion look flawless. * The skin feels a little more even and the matte finish is lasting. * I purchase this sunscreen over and over again.  It's the only sunscreen I use daily on my face.  
goes on smoothly and clearly.  No white haze to deal with. * This goes on smooth as silk and makes my skin feel so good and protected.  There is no smell and it isn't oily at all * This sunscreen goes on well and even though it's tinted just leaves the skin smooth with a nice matte finish. * This product is one of my favorite makeup starter regime. Its not greasy and I feel it holds up to the Matte name . Especially, after I have applied all my anti-aging morning serums. Great feel,no unpleasant smell,and smooth feeling . Great under my foundation makeup. Does not peel,by the way. * It has a weird silicon consistency but it doesn't look greasy and shiny on my face which I like. Applies smoothly. I'm happy with using a mineral product on my face for daily use."

It really disagrees with something in my skincare. It pilled so so bad. Over skincare, under makeup, etc. Only did 'ok' when I had very little under it

I use, have repurchased and keep a backup of LRP Anthelios UV Hydra Sunscreen SPF 50 with Hyaluronic Acid. It's way better and still high spf. * This is the worst sunscreen, tried it on my face and it left me GREASY and pilled. Since it said for body as well and i spent a lot of momey i tried on my arms and left the worst rash ever. If you can, DONT buy this sunscreen and go for something else * I have very oily skin and this one did not work for me. It felt very greasy on the skin and even somewhat tacky/sticky. It did not wear under my makeup well for this reason. * I have tried this and the blue lizard during the summer! This has nothing to compare to blue lizard! It goes on so smoothly I do recommend reapplication time because it avoids red spots/sunburns! This sunscreen has been a great holy grail for my beach and pool days! * this sunscreen is terrible do NOT buy. i am fairly white and the sunscreen does not blend at all, it leaves a disgusting white residue that will not come off. leaves ur skin feeling greasy instead of hydrating * So I applied this sunscreen on cleansed skin after a shower with no other skin products. Unfortunately it left a smeary white residue that did not ""melt in"" on face, ears, neck and arms at all. I do not recommend this sunscreen for any skin tones, Whether you are dark, medium or light because you will look and feel gross. Also my eyes started to burn after second application. * No scent.  Super lightweight.   Not greasy.  An amazing body spf I don't mind putting on.  Only downside is the price"
22,e.l.f. cosmetics,suntouchable whoa glow broad spectrum spf 30 sunscreen,pimprod2036596,2605491," * This has shimmer but it doesn't look crazy. Sounds weird but on my skin just makes it look like I got a wonderful tan. It gives a beautiful glow when I were this under makeup. In the picture below I'm only wearing sunscreen. * This is a nice dupe to the Supergoop Glowscreen. You may have to squeeze out twice to get the finish you like; however with the Supergoop Glowscreen, I only needed to squeeze once so you may end up using faster. It's a very good product overall and saves you money. * Melted off my face on a hot beach day… literally. Burned my eyes. Didnt even work, got sun on my face. * Might have gotten a faulty bottle? My sister and I both tried the product multiple times and found it patchy/pilling off the skin instantly. Bummer since it had a pretty shimmery bronze color. * Ive used this with so many different products and it pills like crazy. Wish i returned and wish they would stop making this its THAT BAD. * I like to use it from time to time whenever I want a glowy makeup. * I bought this as a potential dupe for the Supergoop Glowscreen, but this was GLITTERY. Glitter was everywhere. I've used and loved the Supergoop and can now confirm it is worth the money."
23,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen body spf 40 invisible sun protection,pimprod2038031,2606364," * I was so excited when I found this sunscreen. I received a sample size for my face and used the whole bottle. It was great! Then I bought the body sunscreen for my vacation and after the first use I realized what an expensive mistake it was. It didn't absorb well and left greasy, chunky residue all over my body. It looked like my entire body was peeling from a bad sunburn. This is a very expensive sunscreen for it to not be usable. I don't want to hang out in a public location looking like my skins peeling and I'm shading chunky skin cells all over a public pool. Gross!! * Goes on light.  Not greasy and doesn't leave white residue like some sunscreens do. * I do really like this sunscreen- it's like a clear gel with a velvety finish (think primer consistency). It's rather expensive though for what you get- considering it's a body sunscreen, this wouldn't even get you through a week at the beach. * No matter which supergoop I try they are heavy greasy they do block the sun but feel horrible * Me gusta mucho, no deja la piel grasosa, te da brillo y protege * Absolutely terrible! I broke out in a rash about an hour after using. Theew it away immediately! * I love the OG unseen sunscreen for my face and its the perfect texture and viscosity. I was hoping this would be too. I hate the lotion texture of others so i was really excited that SG came out witb this. The only problem is that its just oily… it absorbs well and makes my skin feel REALLY SOFT but since i do sweat pretty easily it can feel a bit slick at times. Maybe its the olive oil in it? Or its just too many oils."

Its very oily and never dried down, not great for on the go and would stain your clothes. It does have glitter in it which i thought was cute and fun, didnt bother me since i wanted this for a disney trip to be fun anyways. The serum is fantastic, i ended up returning this set snd buying that full size. It doesn't give any shimmer which is misleading since it looks shimmery in the bottle. But it protects well, high spf, dries down quickly and felt moisturizing. * Literally the most amazing sunscreen ever! Your skin feels smooth and not greasy. * bought this to test the products instead of buying the full sizes separately. I dont find the sun shield body glow to give much of a glowy look. the stick does give off some shimmer/glitter. also I've found these products dont really settle in my skin and makes me sweat more. I do wish this kit came in the darker shades * I feel like I got a really great deal because I got the full size stick, which I love!  It took a couple of swipes but love how portable this stick is and the glow.  I always wanted to try their other sun products so I'm happy I got a chance to * Love the options in this kit! it's perfect for the summer. All the ingredients are clean and moisturizing, but not sticky. * My bumps on my chest came overnight . Theyre not normal, it will take MONTHS to get rid of these hard crators ! :( * Both of the face products apply wonderfully and work well under makeup. I have been looking for sunscreen with glitter and the stick gives a subtle sparkle without looking like you got attacked by a child's craft project. The price is also great - you get enough product to try before you decide if you want a full size."
25,it cosmetics,hello sunshine invisible sunscreen for face spf 50,pimprod2044384,2623536," * I do really like this sunscreen. Goes on nicely, skin looks luminous. I have pretty fair skin and don't spend a lot of time in the sun. I'm usually only outside for a couple hours and it works great. I did apply 3 times throughout the day (as directed) a few weeks ago as I was in and out of the sun more than usual. By mid afternoon it was pilling when I touched my face :/ * I live in a dry environment and my skin is combo so this moisturizing sunscreen feels amazing! does not leave a white cast on my brown skin and just feels nice overall. I do wait a few minutes for it to soak in before I apply makeup though. * This was my first sunscreen purchase from IT. I had been using Neutrogena but it had a watery feel so I tried IT and am happy that I did. This has a nice creamy feel, but not an oily feel at all. You can put your face primer overtop and it doesn't feel heavy. I like it so much that I purchased the larger size on sale. * I'm now purchasing my third tube. I used it every day underneath my makeup. I love how it makes my skin feel. I highly recommend it! * I don't have sensitive skin and usually use the Ordinary, urban rx and good molecule but was referred by ulta lady to get this instead of the ordinary sunscreen and terrible mistake. I broke out so bad with small heat rash all over my face. It looks so bad and looks like hives. Totally would not recommend. * I put this on 3x daily. A lot of people don't realize that wearing sunscreen everday isnt only for sun protection. its for hydration. And holy cow. This stuff is perfect. I have very dry skin, but not anymore. This stuff saved my face. I wash my face AM and PM. Put on toner, brightening serum and hello sunshine in the AM. Mid/late afternoon, i rinse my face, sprtiz on toner then reapply hello sunshine. PM i wash my face, toner, brightening serum, estee lauder under eye, estee lauder face moisturizer, and again, hello sunshine. Sometimes i apply hello sunshine 4x daily, if face is feel crisp, but im telling you. If i wasnt so anal about face care, this would be a stand alone product. Worth the $$. * I put this on 3x daily.

26,shiseido,clear sunscreen stick spf 50+,pimprod2022854,2576053," * (1) I love the size of this stick sunscreen (smaller than my iphone)
(2) Easy to apply on top of foundation without ruining it 
(3) No cast and it blends naturally * I absolutely love this sunscreen stick! I originally bought it for my kiddo who has very sensitive skin—if he gets burned, it's tears and agony, and most sunscreens we've tried either cause stinging or irritation. I've tested so many different brands, and this one has been by far the best for his skin.

It goes on clear, doesn't burn, and provides amazing protection. I'm so relieved to finally have a sunscreen he's comfortable wearing. I'll be buying this over and over again! It's also super convenient to toss in my bag, though I've learned to keep it in my cooler bag on really hot days so it doesn't soften.

Highly recommend for anyone—especially those with sensitive skin. It's a game-changer! * Perfecto for my sensitive skin and most importantly for me, black girl approved no white casting. I have been literally in the hunt for a good quality sunscreen since my go to seem to have changed their formula. Ya'll did your big one with this. * Post/in between biking I can easily apply and after a few minutes it feels like nothings there. The shiseido sunscreens have been incredibly helpful in fading my dark marks, excellent sunscreen that is easy to reapply every two hours and some azelaic acid for the win.

Literally apply at my desk before packing up my stuff to head home so get that PM coverage. * We love this sunscreen. And as a family that has young kids and parents with a history of skin cancers, this is what we use. Non greasy and breathable. I stock up every spring and throughout the summer. * It glides on over makeup without moving it. I had my partner and sister try it over thier makeup and it didnt disturb it. My gfs makeup is dewy and my sisters is matte. Worked for them both. I love it aswell bc it doesnt break me out. This is my second one * Ive bought two of this product now, and love it. Its lightweight, doesn't burn your eyes, and doesn't clog pores. Lasts a long time too!"
27,good molecules,sheer mineral sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2037436,2606130," * This blends onto the skin very well and I didnt have any whitecast. I think it works best when you stick to rest of Good Molecules Daily Essentials box plus the cleanser and use this last. Occasionally I felt a little tingling sensation on my skin after applying but haven't had a reaction or stinging eyes like with chemical sunscreens. My skin tends to be oily and this sunscreen didn't make it shinier than usual so that made me happy. I feel bad others didnt have a good experience with it but it's well loved in my routine. * I have oily skin and my skin gets irritated really fast I don't have this problem with this product * Okay facial sunscreen for the price, it hasnt pilled for me and seemed to blend fine with my skincare but it feels heavy on my skin and it DOES leave a white cast. I'll finish the full tube but I wont be re-purchasing. * I recieved this in my Freebies Bag with my order and was excited to try it.... this excitement quickly died. I rubbed it in fully (slight white cast but I worked it in and it went away) but even after laying out to tan so it would fully soak into my skin, got in the pool and when getting back out, hello Casper the friendly ghost. Streaks of white all over me. Truly can say I've never had anything like that before. I'll finish out what I have cause I hate to waste but absolutely will not be purchasing and wouldn't recommend anyone purchase it. * Not a true Mineral Sunscreen! Good molecules why would you put Chemical Butyloctyl Salicylate or any Salicylates into Sunscreen especially a ""Mineral sunscreen""? This gave me a rash. I do not recommend. And it is not Mineral sunscreen, transparency should be practiced when advertising Mineral when ingredients say otherwise. Don't trust your products anymore. * Live this sunscreen doesnt make me feel greasy at all & leaves no ehote cast, the only thing is i wish it csme in a higher coverage like 50. * I got this as a gift to try out, and personally, I didn't enjoy the product. As someone with a medium skin tone, this suncreen left a pretty noticeable white cast. I also have very dry, eczema prone skin and this left my skin flaky and dry, and kind of itchy afterwards. Overall, just not for me, but it might work if you have a different skin type."
28,coola,classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 50,pimprod2012268,2561101," * This is it.  The relentless search for sun protection that actually works has come to halt.  Our family has sensitive, translucent skin and fry in the sun within two minutes.  Someone is always burning!  Coola wins the spray sunscreen.  Didn't expect much from this sunscreen, but I stand corrected.  Gladly!  It's clear, scent is minimal, sprays evenly.  The down side of it us the amount of product for the price.  Not a fan of the price, though.  It's a bit steap, but it is what it is. * Works plus smells good and feels very refreshing during application. * I have easy to burn skin, so I'm always on the hunt for a good sunscreen.  This Coola one is the best so far.  I even forgot to reapply and still didn't burn.  I love that it goes on completely clear and it doesn't feel greasy.  I just wish it was a little more affordable, but it's still worth the money. * The product itself is amazing. Used it 3 times and it is almost empty, for the price it fell like a total rip off * This sunscreen smells totally not. Like .sunscreen. Just smells really fresh and delicious and all while keeping you safe in the sun ! Wow. A tad pricey so I keep it for myself ! * After suffering stinky chemical smelling SPF sprays, I finally tried this brand. Twice the price but so worth it. Smells like heavenly Guava Mango and that's it. It outlasts the 80 minute rec time, is moisturizing and allows for tan with no burn. * Fragrance free. Not sticky or greasy. My skin felt like I hadn't applied sunscreen. My new go to sunscreen spray."

For the price, not worth it anymore * I got a set with a small can of this to have on hand for travelling and finally tried it… and wow. Soaks in without needing to rub and leaves skin feeling soft, unlike most sunscreen sprays that feel tacky unless you work it into the skin. Worked all afternoon in the sun and didn't burn, didn't even really get much tan at all! I'm gonna have to get a big can now… * The sunscreen did it's job and my daughter like the smell. The issue is that I expected to get at least four applications out of it. She went to the pool for one day and used it three times and it came home empty. Admittedly, the can was light when I bought it, but since it had the original plastic wrap on it, I assume it was a ""full"" can, and for three applications at this price, I won't be buying it again. * It's a good sunscreen that leaves your skin soft and shiny. * So I bought  this product  for my vacation  and I used  it cause I was really burned  and so I put it on and I got a rash and the next day I was more burned than ever and it felt  like there was no spf. * I took this product on vacation and after four of us applied the bottle was empty! * Took this with on my vacation to Punta Cana. Ran out after 2 days of use between my husband and I. Good coverage, but gone way too quick for the price paid."

It feels ok when you first put it on but gets flaky towards the end of application. It is very moisturizing but extremely to shiny and greasy for me . If it wasn't for that I would repurchase it . * best product for my acne-prone skin. makes my skin glowy and i think it's been healing my moisture barrier * broke me out so badly I am still dealing with it a month later will never use again * My friend had the higher end ultra sheer Neutrogena sunscreen, and she had to use mine instead; this doesn't make you look like a ghost, and with a spf of 50 it was great for the Grand Canyon * I use this all year especially in the summer and when we go to the southwest. * This moisturizer is good, and I like that it doesn't leave a white haze on my face. But it seems to work its way into my eyes, and it stings for a long time. I don't think I will buy it again, but it is good enough. * Thats all jusy buy it!"
32,kopari beauty,rose gold sun shield body glow gel spf 45,pimprod2037855,2605238," * This works well on my light dry skin. Moisturizes and gives a slight glow. I don't mind wearing sunscreen with this. * •This prosuct stays gooey and doesnt absorb into skin at all. Consider this when on a beach and all the sand that will adhere to you!
•Beware using it on a boat. It stained the seats I sat on while aboard our boat and the stains did not come off even after multiple attempts to get it off. Think about this before boarding a friend's boat!
•Stains set in the lining of my bathing suit and did not come out after multiple washings afterwards. Especially in the cleavage area. * This does gove a nice glow.  But i bought this dueing Ulta days of beauty at 50% off ans still feel like I over paid.

The product takes a long time to absorb into skin I feel like the SPF is not adequate to be used if outdoors.  I use ir alot for errand running where im running in and our of buildings. * This product is beautiful but its so oily and never seems to dry on me. Wouldn't buy again. * This product is great! Don't discontinue it now… * I'm all about glitter and glow but this isn't it! My skin burned so the spf isn't effective. Did make me shiny but baby oil and other stuff that is cheaper has the same effect. I'll stick to Supergoop's glow spf * I love that this product has spf in it, its easy to apply but its very overpriced. It doesn't add a shimmer to my skin it's just an oil with spf. I don't believe i would purchase this again"
33,la roche-posay,anthelios ultra light sunscreen lotion spray spf 60,pimprod2018266,2570213," * AWESOME PRODUCT. HAVE USED FOR 3 YEARS. PROTECTS, DOES NOT LEAVE WHITE RESIDUE BECAUSE IT BLENDS INTO YOUR SKIN. WE LOVE LA ROCHE-POSAY PRODUCTS CAUSE THEY WORK AND YOU DON'T BREAK OUT. LEAVES YOUR SKIN SMOOTH. * This applies well and feels like nothing on the skin. Would definitely repurchase. * The only sunscreen my sunscreen-averse husband will use. He finds it convenient to spray (his face, bald head, body, everywhere), it absorbs quickly when rubbed in, and it is the most effective one at preventing burns of the many we have tried. * Ive given this sunscreen many chances and everytime it gets into my eyes. It burns for a while too. As soon as you use a towel/rag to soothe your eyes a minute later they'll start burning again. This can happen for hours. Wanted to love this because it doesn't leave a white cast if you rub it in enough, but the eye burning isn't worth that. * i bought this in store at the beginning of summer after an employee recommended it to me. i'm a natural redhead, so im pretty pasty and prone to skin cancer/burning easy. i was hesitant because it was super pricy - but a little goes a long way!!! i work outside in the sun all day and have every day for the summer, and i havent burnt ONCE since buying and actively using this. i still have over half the bottle after 2/3 months. it is so worth the money. * I really wanted to like this BUT I've used it a few times and for some reason, after about an hour, even though I'm not sweating, this sunscreen starts to get in my eyes and even my mouth! Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation. It has Benzophenone in it, which can cause contact  dermatitis. I get an allergic reaction on my eyelids every time I've used this product."
34,coola,organic classic face sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2003902,2541377," * My favorite face sunscreen. Not greasy at all. * I LOVE Coola's Fregrance Free Organic Face Sunscreen. (I tried the Cucumber scent and it irritated my skin, but the fragrance-free is awesome.) It's expensive, but a little goes a long way. I use it daily as a moisturizer. I have not burned once while wearing it. And, my favorite thing about it is, if you sweat while wearing it, and the sweat runs in your eyes, it doesn't sting or burn at all. I have been using it for a couple of years now, and I would definitely recommend it. * Easy to apply. Absorbs quickly leaving no white cast. Keeps my fair skin from burning even in intense sun at the beach. I was allergic to the reformulation of another ""sensitive skin"" sunscreen brand that I had been using for years. No problems with Coola. It also does not run in my eyes when doing yard work on hot days. Putting sunscreen on to protect my skin is no longer a chore.  My beach-loving hair stylist recommended Coola. She knows!!! * This product absorbs nicely, but throughout the day will pill. I don't wear any other products under or on top of sunscreen, so it's undeniably this product. Super disappointing, especially given the price. Won't buy again. * This is a clean sunscreen that feels like skincare and is fragrance-free. For a skin comparison - my skin is normal to dry and very fair with freckles. Sunburns would be common for my skin if I didn't wear this every day. * This is one of the few face sunscreens I've tried that doesn't burn my eyes, even when I sweat!! 

It applies so easily and doesn't leave a film OR make my skin feel tight and dry. The consistency is somewhere between a lotion and an average sunscreen; takes no time to apply (and layers well over my other skincare) and hasn't left me with a white cast so I don't need a mirror to slap it on.

So far, it hasn't broken me out or given me any kind of reaction and I've been using it almost daily for about two weeks.

As someone who has always hated how sunscreen feels, this one had made getting into the habit easy and enjoyable. I plan on investing in the body formula too. Highly recommend!! * Purchased this to wear for hiking and outdoor activities. As a dark skin gal, no white cast is crucial. And this delivers well. Doesn't feel heavy or too greasy. When I sweat, there's no white streaks. Didn't break out from wearing this, but I don't wear it all day."

Honestly was impressed that I found a mineral sunscreen that I can wear from time to time (my main man is still Supergoop! Unseen) * This is my holy grail of facial sunscreen. It doesn't make my sensitive skin itch nor does it sting my eyes. I have rosacea, and this is the only sunscreen I have found the soothes my skin rather than irritate it. I look forward to applying it every morning. It makes my skin feel fabulous. * I like this mineral sunscreen - but if you're sensitive to scents I would definitely NOT recommend. For me, the smell doesn't linger so I use this in my purse to re-up sunscreen throughout the summer days. * I love everything about this sunscreen except for the scent.  It melts right in- it's a nice, slightly tinted, thin liquid.  It's moisturizing and not irritating to my skin.   BUT, it smells like moldy cucumbers and grass.  The first time I put it it on, I was hopeful that the scent would at least diminish somewhat as it set.  Nope, it was still very smelly six hours later when i washed it off.  I will use for hiking, outdoor workouts, bike rides, etc., but I won't be wearing it anywhere where I might be in remotely close proximity to other people. * I love this face sunscreen. Clean ingredients & melts in quickly. Not greasy at all, will be repurchasing when I am out * This formula is almost exact to the rhode glazing milk in terms of feel and consistency. I love the way this feels on my dry skin. I got as a gift with purchase but once i run out i am buying it. I have sensitive dry skin and loved this. I am also a medium complexion latina and this did not leave a white cast. * If you're sensitive to smells this is not for you. I saw a few other reviews that said the same thing but still tried it. Its so heavily fragranced that I had a headache all day from it, even after wiping it off."
37,supergoop!,triple prep weightless multitasking moisturizer spf 40 face sunscreen,pimprod2043911,2620576," * Not all of supergoop products are winners Unfortunately, i noticed this sunscreen caused my face to be slightly inflamed and red and irritated for awhile. And oddly, what made it worse was i touched my face later with my finget that was damp and it started to burn! Very weird. Then i happen to rub my chin and it just started pilling and coming off. Wouldnt even bother trying to put makeup over this one. * I'm a fair-skinned man who has been looking for a daily moisturizer/SPF combo for years that does not irritate my eyes as the day goes on. This was recommended to me by a coworker and an Ulta employee separately. I've been using it for a year and swear by it - I like that it doesn't have a scent, moisturizes well, and most importantly, has NEVER irritated my eyes. This is my go to. Cannot recommend enough. Love it so much that I've gifted it to my siblings. * I have used other products of this brand and was hoping this would be a one treatment before makeup. Unfortunately it created a peeling like feeling combined with my makeup which has never happened before. 

I also feel like it makes my face red. 

The one thing I like most is the design, jar allows you to get every drop of product which is appreciated! * I've tried applying this alone and with my regular skincare routine and it pills up under makeup no matter what. Seems fine alone but still got kind of peely on the neck. * The first half of this jar was perfect but the closer i got to being halfway through this product it began to pill. Was pretty upset * This is my fIrst review. I have spent thousands on skincare for fine lines and milia. I have had lasers, injections, etc. This cream has completely erased my fine lines and almost completely eradicated years of milia around my eyes. I have my best friend hooked and I will never purchase a different cream. With that being said, it is not for sensitive skin. In my experience, anything that is this effective is not going to be gentle. I do not have sensitive skin. I can feel some burn, but no redness or reaction. I am 48 and I now have my skin back from my early 30s. I only wish that i would have had this then. * I haven't had any issues with this product besides the fact that it has a pretty bad smell to it so it's not enjoyable to put on."

Highly recommend!! * Id def say maybe add a stronger SPF BEFORE adding this product. Im extremely hard to tan no mayter how long I stay out in the sun. I was out for like 2 hours and I BURNT lol I sprayed it on twice too. So yea, it works just be mindful. Def wiñl purchase again * I LOOOOOVE this product. I'm obsessed with all Coco and Eve products. This smells so good. It makes my skin so soft and gives a natural and pretty glow. Plus it protects from the sun. I use this every day! * Took this oil on my cruise the best of the best inonly use braIllian products and this ia close to it amazing smelling glowing tan * I never tanned so fast. Omg. * Im on the hunt for the best tanning oil and previously I tried bali body, however today I layed outside for an hour with this nice smelling oil and I believe I tanned better.

As others have said, it stains whatever you're wearing. The scent isn't great. And I didn't feel it bronzed me at all. I ended up returning it because it just wasn't worth the prize tag and for what it claims to do, there are better, more effective products on the market. Total pass. * Bro. To summarize: let me quote another review of this lotion that I read. 

""This feels like a prank""

I'm a fairly pale person and I use self tanning foam etc. products fairly regularly. 
WHEN I TELL YOU 
I might as well have squirted brown acrylic paint from hobby lobby all over my body. There is no subtlety. there is no blending. There is only opaque brown. I considered for a moment ""surely I missed something. Surely the directions must have stated the need to dilute, use some sort of glove or applicator, or maybe I just bought a bottle labeled ""extra extra extra extra extra dark dark almost offensively so""

Sure it smells nice but the benefits stop there. 
I was audibly cackling at the absurdity of this product and simultaneously panicking at the thought of trying to get it off of me. 
How anyone could apply this without 2 
partners to help them is beyond me. 

When I got about half my arm done I decided screw this and started using water to try to remove it . Whole bathroom covered in brown splash stains. 

At the end of this chaos when it was finally off of me , I was just scratching my head as to how this product got made. I looked up google reviews and saw a stark split of one star and five star reviews and then quickly noticed every five star review was annotated with [incentivised review]. Got it. In the reviews where people actually wore it around it just ended up staining the everything it came into contact with 

Don't buy this product unless you want a good laugh. * First of all, if you thought this was self tanner, that's on you for not paying attention to the words in the description and product name. 

It gives you some temporary color. It smells good, soaks in well, leaves a pretty sheen, and for me it hasn't ruined any of my clothes or furniture. At first I was washing my palms afterward to get rid of any extra settling into the lines, but soon learned I can just rub them together hard and any extra gets redistributed and absorbed. 

I bought it when it was on sale and now I'm kicking myself for not getting more at that price! * This works okay but it's streaky no matter what I do. Have to rub the excess that wont absorb off after it dries. The real issue is the smell. It is SO BAD. Like musty moldy smell mixed with chemical smell of self-tanner. * This is not only the worst tanning product I've dudes, it's the worst beauty product I've used. Please check the other reviews that show pictures of the stains this leaves behind. 

It does not apply smoothly, it took a long time to workout in to not be streaky. I figured it would dry down. Nope. It's a sloppy mess. It stained the chair I was sitting in, my clothing, and my towel causing hundreds of dollars of damage and it didn't even look good. 

When I tried to return it I told the girl at the register that they should warn people who are buying this product that it stains worse than a permanent marker and her reply was ""well I haven't heard anybody else complain."" Clearly the other reviews here prove otherwise. 

Stay away. * Does it appear to make you tan? Yes but what cost? It stains any fabric it comes in contact with and no matter how even you try to apply it, it becomes blotchy. If you have deep pores or any texture fo your skin it will AMPLIFY those blemishes. I really wanted to love this product. * I bought a ton of Vacation products to try, since I was hearing good things and getting ads for them constantly, and I liked the normal SPF 30 & 50, so I had high hopes and expectations for the bronzing lotion. To set the scene, my husband and I recently bought a boat, and I could not wait to get super tan, maybe the tannest I've ever been with this as my champion! And it worked, but it almost cost me my marriage of only two years! (kidding, but like not...)

This made such a mess and stained nearly everything it came into contact with - multiple towels & bathing suits, my usual seat in the bow area and a few other places around the boat. Worst of all, no amount of bleach or stain remover gets these stains out!! My husband usually isn't one to get mad about stuff like this, but when he saw that none of the heavy cleaners were doing anything to combat the orange smears and spots, he put the hammer down and said that if I continue on this quest to be the tannest of them all, and use this one more time, he's banning me from the boat for the rest of the summer - maybe completely! Which was a bit harsh, but I don't blame him one bit!

So even though the bottle itself only costs like $20-25, I'm now paying way more to replace towels, a couple of my bathing suits, and as many cleaners/stain removers I can find until something works! Even though I'm extremely proud of my current tan, it is SO not worth the mess and potentially hundreds of $$$ to try to replace/repair everything!! 

Stay away if you value literally anything - whether that be a relationship or a material item!!"
40,sun bum,daily 50 body lotion,pimprod2043280,2619925," * I LOVE the smell of Sunbum sunscreen so i was stoked to find the daily lotion.  It smells exactly like the sunscreen, is lightweight and doesnt leave my skin feeling greasy. I also like that it offers some sun protection as im in an out of the sun quite often. * I needed a moisturizer and an SPF so thought this would perfect! After a few wears, I realized it didnt provide me with any sun protection because i would turn red and burn much like when i dont wear sunscreen, particularly my chest. I figured i do like the scent and the non-greasy feel so ill just finish the bottle as a moisturizer. Sadly this has caused my skin to dry out more than if i used NO moisturizer and I am not just disappointed but shocked. I usually use Cera Ve and I feel like my skin has never been more dry and scaly, EVER, than with consistent use of this product. :( 

There is absolutely NO reason I would ever buy this and I never like to waste product but this is going. * Wanted a light,non greasy spf lotion for hands and arms. This is a winner. Smells nice but can't smell unless I put my hands to my nose and I prefer it that way.  Have bought Sun Bum spf lip balm in the past and always loved it,now I can add their spf body lotion to my favorite list of products. * I use this product every single day. I've bought at least 5 bottles this summer. Its a true holy grail. Its not sticky. It never ever pills. I love how smooth,soft and well protected it makes my skin feel. Very comfortable. It leaves begind a soft,dewy sheen. I have not burned once while wearing it. It's excellent for use anytime you're not in/by the water. (You could, but I would use traditional sunscreen for that.) It smells amazing as all Sunbum products do. That fades rather quickly so it doesn't interfere with perfume. I do wish this product were available in a larger size,but at least it's in a pump. * I have sensory issues that make me more sensitive to how products feel on my skin. The vast majority of sunscreens feel sticky or greasy in some way, but I push through those feelings because wearing sunscreen is extremely important. Enter this sunscreen. SPF50, pleasant to apply, and NOT GREASY AT ALL! I would love if this formula came in different sizes so I can travel with it. Sun Bum nailed it with this one! * I am super surprised that this lotion is as good as it is. Im really picky about my choice of sunscreen, well let me tell you this is a high quality moisturizer for me and I've been using it each morning! My skin feels great and it protects me, I haven't been sunburned since using it. I reapply if I'm outside working and sweating, so make sure to do that! Yes I recommend, I'm already ordering a 2nd bottle, you get a lot of product for a low price compared to others on the market. This works as well as, or better than prestige brands, IMO. Its non greasy and actually moisturizing too! Really happy i took a chance on this one. I live in Southern California and the sun is always out, so wearing sunscreen is not an option! * Love the scent and how easily it applies (like any typical lotion).  The pump is amazing - loved it for putting lotion on me and the kids before we left the house.  Everyone would comment on the wonderful beachy scent (banana/coconut)."
41,supergoop!,daily essentials spf starter kit,pimprod2036549,2603598," * It is a great way to try a product but honestly not for everyone. I have combination skin and found myself disliking the sticky, heavy feeling. * The setting mist bottle does not spray. It is 30 minutes to my nearest Ulta store to return. Frustrating purchase! * I live on an island and absolutely don't leave the house without sunscreen, but I've never found a product that I loved for my face until now. I have combination skin and Unseen Sunscreen has become my new daily. It is smooth as silk and feels identical to Smashbox primer, if you've tried that. It absorbs almost immediately but leaves my skin soft and ready for makeup, but I think it blurs well enough that l dont need makeup (I'm in my 40's). This little sample tube has lasted me two weeks of daily use and it's finally running low. I use an amount the size of my index nail and it's enough for my face, neck, and the backs of my hands. I read some reviews questioning the SPF value, but they seemed unfounded and I wonder if those reviewers were using authentic product. 

Yesterday I went out boating for four hours and I relied only on this little kit. The Refresh spray was nice for reapplication, which I only remembered once, halfway through the day. I didn't get burned at all, even under these harshest conditions. 

The Play Everyday lotion was fine. It worked well and I definitely would have burned without it, as I missed a few spots and am absolutely fried. It just doesn't stand out above other sunblocks to me. 

Nonetheless, I'm very happy that I ordered this kit. These aren't cheap products but the quality is excellent and I don't skimp on skincare. This kit allows you to try each and see how your skin responds before investing in larger sizes. * These are so small they should be free samples. I haven't even used them yet, but I should have looked more closely at the size before ordering. The price is way too high for these tiny bottles. You will basically get one or two applications with each. * I have bought this twice and it is such good value and it lasts a while. * I love this product but the bag (a big asset on why I bought this set) is an ok sized bag that feels cardboardy. The sizes of the products are pretty reasonable. The ""Unseen Sunscreen"" is very soft and silky. None of the products leave my skin with white cast or oil and grease. My skin feels amazing after using this product. I would recommend this set or even the full size of all these products. Over I would recommend this! * Cheap way to try 3 sunscreens! Loved both the lotions but wasn't a big fan of the spray. It felt greasy."
42,e.l.f. cosmetics,suntouchable all set for sun spf 45,pimprod2039944,2611368," * It works just fine as a sunscreen but as a setting spray it sucks. It doesn't keep your makeup in place, but makes it move. It has a creamy consistency when dried and it never soaks into your skin. * I took a chance on this product and I wish I made a different choice. It felt sticky on my face and it just didn't work for me.  I'm just the kind of person who doesn't like a lot of stuff on my face. I prefer creams or lotions that feel light and not greasy! * It made made me really oily and the mist dosent spray evenly * I did not like this as a setting spray. The spray  pattern is too strong, which made me want to hold it farther from my face to apply it, but then the product would get into my hairline and become sticky in my hair. I gave up using it as a setting spray after 5-6 tries. Now I use it as a quick arm sunscreen if I'm going around the block to pick up my mail. * I used this prduct from march - june I didn't experience any reaction but I do know it did make my skin feel a little greasy. In july i experienced a reaction my face was red, inflamed, itchy, and my cheeks were a little swollen. I avoided the spray until recently this past week I accidentally sprayed it in my face and by night time my face was red so i took Benadryl and hours later at 4am i woke up with my face and eyes swollen. I went to the ER got a steroid shot and swelling went away and currently taking medication for this week. I never have reactions to any product on my skin which is why i thought it was weird. * This product is so convenient and I wanted to love it so much but unfortunately my sensitive skin (specially around the eyes) didn't like it. It burned my skin, I could feel the burning sensation, rinsed it off but still left a mark on both corners of my eyes :( * It gets everywhere even your eye creases and eventually burns your eyeballs. I got a spf glide on jelly stick instead and love it!"
43,sun bum,face mist spf 45,pimprod2021621,2575599," * I received the travel size as a fgwp a while back and threw it in my luggage at the last minute before leaving to go to my sister's lake house for a week, I didnt have any expectations one way or the other but boy was I wrong! We all LOVED it and everyone raved about how well it worked and didnt break anyone out and didn't cause any skin irritations! Will definitely purchase the full size!! * I got the for the first time in a little Sun Bum travel kit and fell in love with it. It's nice for a little refresher when you're out and about, but then it also works for a reapplication of sunscreen for the rest of your body when you're out and about. When I take my kids to the pool, we lotion up before we go. But every hour, during the breaks, I make sure and reapply to everyone's faces and then go ahead and use it everywhere use (shoulders, back front, arms....). Same thing at Disney, as we're waiting in line for rides, we'll reapply. Since it's not aerosol, I feel like I have more control of it. I also can take this to sporting events because we're not allowed to have aerosol sprays at Kauffman Stadium when we go watch the Royals play. We're are pale people and this has helped keep us sunburned, lol * Would never recommend this for someone to use on face. The irritation this sunscreen causes for my eyes could nt even be flused out. I wore this once to the beach and it scarred me from trying other face spray sunscreen. Wanted to love it and its sleak design. Using its for thr back of my hands and tops of my feet * This product sincerely feels like you sprayed hairspray into your eyes, except that might be better because at least hairspray wouldn't repeatedly run into you eyes throughout the day. Even when blocking your eyes while spraying, this product is so oily that it ultimately ends up stinging them anyway. * burns if it gets in my eyes - kinda itchy. * While this sunscreen can look a little on the greasy side if you overdo it, adding the right amount can turn a bare face kind of day into a clean girl day instantly * Why make a face spray that when people spray it on their face it burns their eyes so bad they can't open them for 30+ minutes?!"
44,coola,scalp & hair mist organic sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2012274,2561108," * I have thicker head of hair with a finer texture. Ive heard great things and bought it hoping it would protect my scalp as my hair is easily weighed down by products. This product left my hair greasy bedore even going outside and being freshly showered. I wouldnt recommend for those of you with a finer hair texture. * Has a pleasant smell andn doesn't leave hair feeling greasy. * Remember when you were dragged to church and all the ladies had on different perfumes and you were forced to sit there for two hours? This is that experience in a bottle. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. * Love this product * This product is great. It keeps my scalp from burning. The scent isnt horrible. The only thing i dont love is how my scalp feels when i put it on. Kinda like hairspray but tacky too. Overall i would recommend this product. I have bought multiple times & made some family buy too! * Love this product.  Reliably keeps my scalp from burning with just a few well-placed spritzes.  Herbal smell dissipates quickly, and I'm careful to avoid spraying too much so I don't get greasy hair.  Also works as a quick SPF spray on neck/shoulders in a pinch. * The actual SPF in this product works well for my hair and scalp, but tell me how is this a sunscreen bottle and the paint on it MELTS when it's in a bag that's hardly even in direct sunlight. The bottle constantly leaks as well, and the scent can be nauseating, especially when it spilled all over other stuff in my bag."
45,vacation,shimmer oil spf 30 sunscreen,pimprod2045400,2623027," * It smells great! Doesn't last but more than a few minutes. The oil effect dissappears within minutes as well and your left with gold sparkles everywhere. Will be returning. Anastasia has a way better one snd the smell on that one lasts all day and is amazing * *   ""Great for adding a subtle shimmer while protecting your skin.""
*   ""A little goes a long way! Super glowy.""
*   ""Love the shimmer, but reapply often!""
*   ""Perfect for vacation vibes.""
*   ""Smells amazing and gives a beautiful glow!"" * My favorite skin shimmer. Ideal for the summer. Gives that beautiful sun kissed skin what I can't get enough. Luxury bottle and beautiful packaging. Would definitely recommend trying it to anyone. Already on my second bottle and buying one for my mom * This stiff is gorgeous! * Love love love this. All my girlfriends asked what I was wearing and got lots of compliments at the pool. The smell alone is enough for me to repurchase. Luckily, you don't need much to go a long way and I have plenty more still. Highly reccommend this! * I finally had the chance to use this shimmer body oil and so far so good. I like the smell and its not sticky! I wish it could last long! But otherwise, i like it. * The design of the bottle isn't good it squirts everywhere when you try to use it ..the product itself isn't has oily or silky like I expected"

48,live tinted,"hueguard 3-in-1 mineral sunscreen, moisturizer, primer spf 30",pimprod2028585,2588656," * So I got this as a free sample and I had to buy the full size. I was looking for a sunscreen that protected and left no white cast and this does that and more. There is no white cast and it's a moisturizer and a primer, plus it feels light on skin * I really wanted to love it because the founder is South Asian and it is meant to be for our skin. Unfortunately it left a white cast, peeled on my skin, and really made me eyes burn. I dont normally have sensitive skin so this was uncommon for me. Really disappointed, especially aboit the whote cast * I like this sunscreen but only if I plan to wear makeup during the day. I dont usually wear makeup daily, but when I'm on trips or going out during the day and want to look nice Ill wear a little bit of makeup (concealer, powder, bronzer, blush). This stuff works GREAT as a sunscreen + primer as my makeup sticks to it so well. It also does not leave any white cast, but make sure to rub in well as it dries fast on the skin and can sometimes leave streaks. I dont like to use it daily as it does not combine well with my topical acne medications (makes my face feel VERY sticky - which is nice when using makeup, but not nice without makeup). Also, I feel as thought it is pretty drying on my skin due to the mattifying effect and I'm a very oily gal. Using daily tends to slighty irritate my skin and cause dry patches. That being said, if youre a sweaty and oily faced person like me, this stuff is a holy grail to use under makeup - but if you also have sensitive skin, I dont recommend using daily. * This sunscreen/moisturizer/primer is fantastic in my opinion. My skin is very sensitive and responds best to mineral sunscreens. I also have a light skin tone but I am of eastern european and arab descent and my skin does have an olive undertoneand. A lot of mineral sunscreens will leave a slight white cast on me. This does not! I like that it feels very light and is not shiny or ultra matte after it dries down. I see that some people complain about an odd ""smell"" with this product and I do notice a slight smell BUT I don't notice it being overpowering and it seems to disappear after several seconds. I absolutely adore this stuff and it works perfectly for me. I will definitely buy this sunscreen again. * I received this as a sample, an loved it. I ususlly mix it with my bb cream and it adds nice moisture to my dry skin. * This sunscreen left a pretty significant white cast. I have around medium-tan olive skin (Armani Luminous Silk foundation shade 7.8), so there are many deeper skin tones than what I have. I wasn't even applying the recommended amount and still got a white cast. This was particularly disappointing from a brand and product that claims to be inclusive. * This goes on so smooth and works great under my tinted moisturizer. No white cast. No eraser-like shavings when applying another product over it. Mineral sunscreen is better for you."
49,sun bum,sunscreen lotion spf 50 xl,pimprod2043282,2619926," * First my complaint, the pump doesn't lock again after it's open. I don't know if it's broken because it's the first time I bought the bottle with the pump, or if this is how it's supposed to work. I do like the pump, it makes it easy to apply and is less messy than using a bottle with a squeeze top. I just wish it would lock again. Aside from that, I am happy with the product. It's nice and creamy and easy to spread. It blends in well and doesn't make me sweat like some other sunscreens.
I would like to transition to a chemical sunscreen but for now I'll stick with this chemical one because it works so well. * I love the smell and rubs in easily like lotion. * I wanted to like this product, but the formula is bad. It seperated, so now i have to vigorously shake the bottle before i use it. Its greasy, and i know its not for the face, but if you put any on your face it will migrate into your eyes and it stings badly. * I just had surgery on my back and I will use this to try and reduce the appearance of the scar (my friend recommends it).  I have used this brand before so I'm just gonna give it 5 starssss!!!! * i was looking for daily sunscreen lotion and got this one but the spf 70; the smell resembles artificial banana, and the feel is very greasy but ends dry yet on the face feels very heavy and greasy at all times. i will only use it now on my body and if I'm outside but for daily use at work and home and on my face this is a 100 percent NO-GO. even if offered for free, i would not accept this again simply cause of the smell. leave no cast when properly rubbed in. leave the skin glittery. good and bad. take what ya want from it. again, highly recommend for the beach but again that smell is BAD. artificial banana does not smell good on humans. * It stings eyes for a long time * Love it best product ever"
50,black girl sunscreen,moisturizing sunscreen lotion spf 30,pimprod2021860,2577186," * I was introduced to this product 2 years ago by a former make-up artist my face loves it! I love how it makes my skin feels soft and glows I have combination skin so I had to learn how to use a little because it can make your skin look oily it's a keeper * It's amazing ! I use it as moisturizer not only a sunscreen!  It's for all shades of skin as well ! Not many people know that. Just found out myself. * I have sensitive skin and like to keep it very simple yet very effective and when i heard boyt sunscreen i really almost became really helpless due to white cast or irritation around eyes. I started using this when my mom got me it and ive grown through so many bottles over 2 years—its very very moisturizing as if you can just go in with this and be done if your in a rush or don't like a heavy feeling with other skincare layering. I will say this to me seems more for a dry skin type just due to it being very very dewy and shiny….yet rich finish if you are pleased with that due to your skin type and preferences—i would say alittle does go along way with this (and i have a heavy hand) just due to it being very rich and dewy. I can say this has helped me feeling more confident of my skin tone and just to know im wearing sunscreen and yet still adding protection give me a very humble blush and plus it doesnt sweat out. Ive too noticed a difference in dark marks so please fellow black queens wear your sunscreen, protect your blessed melanin and show off that sexy sunkissed glow…please know you dont have to feel left out! * I like the Black Girl sunscreen.
The sunscreen is moisturizing and glide on my skin.
I used the 30 because I am not in the sun for a long time.
Next time I will buy Black Girl sunscreen in a high level. * This is a great sunscreen. My skin has cleared more since using this. It has stopped hyperpigmentation from darkening * While it didn't break me out, it made me so GREASY!! With makeup it was SO BAD. I'm giving it two stars because it didn't break me out, it doesn't leave a white cast, and it works... But if you want to be lookin greasy all day, buy it. * Love this sunscreen for daily use!  It's not greasy or smelly, and it doesn't feel heavy on the skin!"
51,vacation,chardonnay spf30 lip oil,pimprod2043687,2620560," * Unfortunately, i have to constantly apply this to feel like i have anything on my lips. Not hydrating at all either, which is crazy for a lip oil. It disappears so fast even when not drinking/eating. Really disappointing for the price! * I wanted to love this lip oil but it did not exceed my expectations. The oil dryes up really fast and my lips do not feel hydrated at all. I gave to reapply multiple times. * I was on vacation in Cancun, in the sun all day, i applied it three times, lips were sun burn 🥲 * I love the idea of a lip oil with SPF. The smell is weird, but I've now found out after the third time wearing it. It's causing my lips to get super irritated and swell up like I just got injections. I've never had issues with being allergic to products before.  Super bummed because I really wanted a lip oil with SPF.. * Smells like fermented cheese and the cap broke from just being in my purse. * Goes on nicely but dries out within an hour. If you keep reapplying your lips will feel parched by the end of the day. I only keep using it because I spent so much on it. * I need to say I do not eat my lip products. I apply it like a normal human. And yet, every time I use this product there is a distinct chemical tang in my mouth afterwards that lasts for ages. Absolutely terrible after taste. Do not recommend!"
52,vacation,classic spray spf 50 sunscreen,pimprod2037342,2606405," * I was so excited to try this product since I read so many rave reviews about it. I couldnt commit until I tried it so I purchased the small bottle. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. I have been dealing with incredible itchy rashes thoughout my entire arms and its been a week since I last used it. I do not recommend! Buyer beware * This smells AMAZING, feels light, smooth, and non greasy. The mini size is perfect for travel or tossing it into your purse. The only drawback is that there wasn't much product. It only contained enough for one day's use— I did share with my girlfriends so this is possibly why. However, I will be purchasing the bigger version soon! * I love how the sunscreen smells and the glow that it gives my skin. * I am extremely fair skinned and am a bit of a sunscreen connoisseur. I have tried almost every sunscreen under the sun. I bought this for the rave reviews on the scent- which is still lovely. HOWEVER over the course of 6 hours I liberally reapplied this sunsnscreen 4x during my pool day because everyone kept telling me I was looking burned. Well, they were right. I was severely burned. Other cons: if you rub to blend, it immediately balls up and pills, I had also shaved that AM and applying it to my legs BURNED. I haven't had a sunburn in over 10 years. Will be returning to my other sunscreens. Extremely disappointing especially considering the price. * Works great and smells SO nice!! * I couldnt belive how little sunscreen this bottle contained. I knew it was travel sized but it didnt even last one DAY at the beach. I wouldnt bother wasting your money buying this mini product unless you intend to cut your beach day short or roll the dice on sun poisoning. * I love this product and is now my go to for the pool!!!"

As someone with combination skin it would leave a matteish finish but after a few minutes i wouldn't see that matteiah finish and my glow would comeback. Some people like that glowy look but its just not for me because of my skin type and my preference.

Some people like that glowy look but its just not for me because of my skin type and my preference. Good product just not for me. * The Ulta Unseen Sunscreen SPF 50 which I received complimentary from Supergoop feels like a primer yet has the protection of a sunscreen.  I love it because it is beneficial for my skin as it diminishes pores and allows for smoother makeup application.   The formula is unique and stands out because of its performance.   I highly recommend especially for traveling and busy days. * This is my all time favorite sunscreen. It is so great for everyday and using underneath makeup. It doesnt pill or change the texture of my makeup. Its weightless and it doesnt leave a white cast. Obsessed! Gifted by supergoop * It's good, just not worth money or intrigues me anymore. Burns eyes, makes skin slightly irritated. Wouldn't buy because there's better for sale out there. * I really like this sunscreen. I buy this size, because I think it is too expensive. * i've struggled with finding a face sunscreen for decades. i'll never look elsewhere. feels so good when it goes on (smooth!) and disappears instantly. isn't shiny, isn't matte, doesn't have any sort of cast. no weird smell. makes a great base for makeup and washes off easily."
55,supergoop!,glow stick sunscreen spf 50 pa++++,pimprod2029935,2589383," * Honeslty this is worth it, I like it and its a perfect sunscreen stick I like to use on my cheeks to give a glowy look, doent really feel greesy unless u like lather ur face in the product but otherwise its woth it! * I love this product.  I have combo skin so I don't apply all over.  I use it as a non-glitter/shimmer highlight on my nose and cheekbones for a fresher look OVER my make up when my face looks ""flat"".  Also use on a fresh face the same way.  And it is AMAZING on my HEALED tattoos...instantly deepens the color, hydrates, and protects.   Stays most the day. * Good dewy sunscreen * It's greasy, causes break outs and doesn't look dewy. You will look like you are greasy. Too expensive to be so bad. * if you want to go to the URGENT CARE wear this product... I got this product from a friend and she said it broke her out. I thought I didn't have sensitive skin in the slightest. I put this product on for a baseball game I went to, I wake up the next day and I have redness and texture around my mouth area. I thought it was just a little breakout that would go away withen a week.... NOPE! I wake up the next day and the previous redness and texture I had got worse and it have moved across my cheeks. It continued like this until it plagued my entire face. I looked like a ballon, it was so bad. I decided that I really needed to go to urgent care to do something about this because it was hot, painful, and so uncomfortable.... I COULD BARLEY OPEN MY EYES!!!! When they finally got to me in the urgent care (2 hours later) we traced my reaction back to the sunscreen I used, I have to get shots and medicine to cure this reaction. Please do your reasearch on whats in this product. * I have had this for just a few days and really like it so far! It's easy for me to apply sunscreen in the morning without getting my hands all gross. The only downside is depending on how much you put on, it takes a while to absorb in your skin/dry. * This product did protect my face from the sun, but hours after I was in the pool it was still greasy! I had to buy a travel bottle of cetaphil cleanser to wash it off! I usually use the sun bum stick, but wanted to try this item after seeing a celebrity going a GRWM video and saw them use this sunscreen!"
56,bubble,solar mate daily mineral spf 40,pimprod2040784,2611777," * I would buy again, but the consistency is kind of sticky which is weird, and it's not really spreadable. And the main reason I bought this, because it didn't leave a white cast, it completely false! I'm black with a dark skin color and it said it suits all skin colors and doesn't leave a white cast. BEWARE IT DOES! * This gave me red bumps on my face and neck and dried out my skin. It's also thick and smells weird. * Got this and i love it. Does not leave no white cast or no burning to my eyes. I have oily combo skin and this leaves my face not feeling oily one bit. Will be repurchasing again!!! * I love the smooth and full coverage I get from this product. The smell of it isn't my favorite, however it's not a deal breaker for me .I love that the product is not greasy or sticky.the product is light weight and that is super important to me as well. * I had high hopes but this product was very disappointing i wish i could return it. It does smell nasty when you first apply but after the smell goes away. This product is not moisturizing at all, instead it makes my face feel really dry but the sensation it leaves heavy and greasy. It also leaves a big white cast that takes a while to go away. Overall don't recommend you buy it. * this worked great. I used it one day when i went to the lake. Never stoped using it since! I only need to apply every 2-3 hours and didnt give me a sunbrun. It was never oily or gave a whitecast. 10/10 Would recommend! * This is a good sunscreen because it absorbs quickly, doesn't run and sting my eyes, and its easy to carry around. There is a definte white cast though when I apply it over my makeup and it smells like hangover throw up. It's so bad I would hold my breath to apply it."
57,vacation,chardonnay oil spf 30 sunscreen,pimprod2037343,2606802," * Seriously, if you're thinking about buying this product do it. It is the best SPF tanning oil you will ever use. I have used this all summer and have not gotten sunburnt once. I recommend this product to eveyone, its amazing! * Specifically looked for something with clean ingredients as sunscreen and this was one of the first items that came up. I love that there's a travel size as that was another thing I was looking for. Took this with me to Las Vegas and Sedona and absolutely loved it. No sunburned just a nice glowing tan!!! * I'm obsessed with this sunscreen but the bottle it comes in leaves something to be desired. Mostly a desire for a clean bag since it will spill and leak in anything its out in if you carry it anywhere outside the house. Even a ziplock wont save you from the leakage. 

Also, it spills so much, it wastes probably 25% or more of the product. * This body oil is lovely. It's lightly scented, goes on easily, isn't too messy, and the spf seems effective. it's been my go to product this summer. * I love this company!!! It smells so good < 3 * I used this while on vacation, I am fair skinned, and diligent at re-applying. This did not provide any sun protection, if anything it amplified my burn. Not the best product from the line I have tried. * I think a lot of people are reviewing this product upon first impression without actually testing out the products sun protection abilities. I tried this numerous times over last summer and while initially the product goes on smooth, it reapplies really poorly. Once you apply the second layer, you start to notice the first layer never fully absorbed and the film it left behind starts to pill and attracts dirt/sand. Beyond that the new layer doesn't seem to really absorb into the skin how it's supposed to so your second layer will leave you very greasy. This is a chemical SPF which means it has to fully absorb into the skin in order to have any sun coverage, but because of the products consistency, it's impossible to reapply. I got sunburnt after trying to use this product numerous times and felt like the SPF element really isn't working especially if you do plan on reapplying through out the day. Beyond that the bottle leaks pretty bad pretty quick so I had to swap it out with a travel bottle. I think this product is probably nice if you're going to be doing some light short-lived activity in the sun, but this should not replace a traditional SPF in your routine because you will wind up greasy dirty and burnt."
58,kopari beauty,sun shield soft glow daily face spf 30,pimprod2038378,2605239," * Bought this item during the 21 days of beauty sale and received in the mail on 9/9/25. The product expired on 06/2025!!  Maybe that's why this item was on sale so they can get rid of inventory. Always check the expiration date on your products. * Ive just started using Kopari products, initially i bought a travel bag with 3 mini size products, loved all of them so i bought full size and this face sunscreen. Of all the products, this is by far my favourite, doesn't feel heavy or leave white reside on your skin. It's incredible, lightweight and feels like silk when applied, like ultralight butter, so satisfying.
Doesnt affect make up at all! 
Id strongly recommend this product, with ulta' return policy allowing you 30 days, its an easy decision. * I went into the store today, and one of the  associates Lex recommended me this product to use as a primer. I instantly loved it. So soft, smooth, blend-able and light. Love how it feels and sinks into my skin. * I thought I liked this but after using it for multiple days in a row, my face started breaking out in white heads and the only thing I can think of is that it's too oily. * Loved the feel and look after applying but broke out next day. I've been looking (for years) for a sunscreen that doesnt aggravate my sensitive skin, but I'll keep looking! * Huge Kopari fan here, but this product caused an epic breakout. Signs were immediate so I only used it one day. Here I am five days later still trying to calm my skin. * Im fairly fair-skinned. I burn then tan. With this stuff my face burned the three timed I used it. It was like putting on tanning oil like we did in the 90s."
59,e.l.f. cosmetics,suntouchable invisible sunscreen spf 35,pimprod2039942,2611369," * This products tends to heavily separate in the packaging and often just squirts out the oil. It is very difficult to shake the product up properly and get it to it's expected consistency. It's not the worst I've ever used but I will not be buying it again. * LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS. absolutely no white cast and leaves a clear, non greasy look. Perfect blurring effect. Why oh why don't don't they make larger size?? Black woman approved. Hot tip: Traders Joe's Facial sunscreen is a great dupe, but only $1 cheaper. * product pills like crazy ! i'm so surprised by all the good reviews and no one mentioning how much it pills. when first applying i was really impressed by how matte and blurry it was making my skin and pores. very silicone-like feel and no strong sunblock scent. it immediately started pilling and i thought maybe i'd need to give it time to sink into the skin before judging but it's been hours now and it's still pilling like crazy ! i have little white globs all over my face, my clothes, my hair, the chairs i sit in. it's getting everywhere. i've never experienced such intense pilling like this before. * I typically use hero shield but ran out and picked this up on my ulta trip, biiig mistake if you have sensitive skin.

Had a reaction to my retinol this week. Normally it will clear up in a day or two but the reaction was persisting and becoming worse. Figured this was just a really bad reaction until I remembered to apply the sunscreen on my neck after the fourth day of using it.

Came home and my neck is completely broken out I wish I could add pictures. Suspecting its some form of contact dermatitis from the product- homosalate can do this. Be careful with chemical SPF if youre sensitive! * I had a reaction immediately after I applied it to my face * This sunscreen gives the nice glowy finish it advertised, but it broke my skin right out unfortunately. Do not reccomend for acne-prone skin * It's the best sunscreen you can ever have because you can wear it over all your makeup or under all your makeup. It's really nice cause it's just built different. It's also really nice cause you can wear it whenever and it's also nice cause you can wear it."

I am so happy I purchased this for our beach family vacation.  I will suggest this item to all my friends. The only thing missing is it isn't waterproof. * I decided to give it a try because I had heard positive reviews. However, when I brought it home and started using it, I experienced breakouts, redness, irritation, and dryness or flakiness. I would definitely not recommend this product for dry or combination skin, and if probably wouldn't recommen this for normal or oily skin. * I use all the Kopari sun products and love them all but this one is my favorite.  I use it on the golf course, beach & at the pool. I am so I tried this product. Its amazing. * I would not purchase this product again. Although the scent/fragrance is lovely, the product did not give the glow I expected. I expected more of a bronzed shimmer, where this product left me shiny, with a greasy look. * Gentle fragrance and no orange!  Use several times per week to build color. * I got an allergic reaction, itchy rashes. My daughter as well had a reaction to it. Try before you buy. * I put the sunscreen on my arms, chest, and back. While it looked and smelled nice, the next morning my skin broke out. I know for sure it's the sunscreen because the rest of my body was clear."

PROTECTS, DOES NOT LEAVE WHITE RESIDUE BECAUSE IT BLENDS INTO YOUR SKIN. WE LOVE LA ROCHE-POSAY PRODUCTS CAUSE THEY WORK AND YOU DON'T BREAK OUT. LEAVES YOUR SKIN SMOOTH. * This applies well and feels like nothing on the skin. Would definitely repurchase. * The only sunscreen my sunscreen-averse husband will use. He finds it convenient to spray (his face, bald head, body, everywhere), it absorbs quickly when rubbed in, and it is the most effective one at preventing burns of the many we have tried. * Ive given this sunscreen many chances and everytime it gets into my eyes. It burns for a while too. As soon as you use a towel/rag to soothe your eyes a minute later they'll start burning again. This can happen for hours. Wanted to love this because it doesn't leave a white cast if you rub it in enough, but the eye burning isn't worth that. * i bought this in store at the beginning of summer after an employee recommended it to me. i'm a natural redhead, so im pretty pasty and prone to skin cancer/burning easy. i was hesitant because it was super pricy - but a little goes a long way!!! i work outside in the sun all day and have every day for the summer, and i havent burnt ONCE since buying and actively using this. i still have over half the bottle after 2/3 months. it is so worth the money. * I really wanted to like this BUT I've used it a few times and for some reason, after about an hour, even though I'm not sweating, this sunscreen starts to get in my eyes and even my mouth! Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation. It has Benzophenone in it, which can cause contact  dermatitis. I get an allergic reaction on my eyelids every time I've used this product."

I look like I went out in the sun without any spf. This product is terrible and did nothing for me. * I like non aerosol spray sunscreen vs. lotions so I was excited to try this. I don't really like the scent or the sticky texture. * Expected SPF 30 protection. This performed like an 8. After 30-minutes, I didn't burn but got white spots. This also smelled like alcohol and had a sticky texture. A gummy residue was left behind after showering. Not for me. * As a cosmetologist and barber, I've seen my fair share of sunscreens, but COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 is a game-changer!  It's like a tropical vacation in a bottle! The piña colada fragrance is so refreshing and fun, it makes applying sunscreen feel like a treat rather than a chore. Plus, it doesn't have that overpowering chemical smell like some other sunscreens. The spray bottle makes it super easy to apply evenly all over your body, even those hard-to-reach spots. No more awkward contortions trying to reach your back! And because it's organic, I feel good knowing I'm not slathering myself in a bunch of nasty chemicals. The protection. SPF 30 is perfect for everyday wear, whether you're running errands or lounging by the pool. Overall, COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 is a must-have. It smells amazing, applies like a dream, and provides top-notch sun protection. Trust me, once you try it, you'll never want to use another sunscreen again! This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I am loving COOLA right now. This SPF is perfect for this dreadful Texas humidity and heat. It's very lightweight, non-greasy, and has a pleasant scent. Reapplying is a breeze since the product doesn't build up on the skin or cause a film. It's very breathable and works well with general skin sensitivities. The size is quite large for travel, but still small enough to throw in your beach bag and still have space for other necessities. It has a click-locking spray top so it doesn't accidentally spray in your bag. I will say that if your skin is very dry, you may want to go for a cream SPF because this does not provide much moisture. This is definitely made for hot, sunny summers. I love it and I know for sure I am buying a full-sized bottle to keep on hand.

***This review was collected as part of a promotion.*** * As a professional in the beauty industry, I've learned firsthand the  importance of sun protection, making COOLA's  spray an indispensable asset. In an industry where skincare is very important, COOLA stands out with its dedication to not only protecting against harmful UV rays but also enhancing the overall experience of sun care.

COOLA's sunscreen spray doesn't just shield your skin from UVA and UVB rays; Its broad-spectrum protection ensures comprehensive coverage, safeguarding against both premature aging and potential skin damage. As someone deeply invested in skin health, I love COOLA's commitment to providing a product that protects and cares for my skin.

The scent of Piña Colada fragrance is delicious. Gone are the days of sunscreen smelling like, well, sunscreen. Instead, COOLA's tropical scent transports me to my last vacation. It's a big change from the clinical smell of traditional sunscreens, making the application process a sensory experience.

I did not have any issue in my delicate skin but I always recommend  a patch test.

In my personal opinion, COOLA's in spray isn't just a sun protection product; it's an  evolution of skincare. With its comprehensive protection, anti-aging benefits, and irresistible Piña Colada scent, COOLA has redefined what it means to stay safe in the sun. So, whether I am lounging by the pool or hitting the beach, I make COOLA my go-to companion for summer adventures. And a big pus smells delicious! * The COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a delightful sun protection experience. Its tropical scent evokes visions of sunny beaches and relaxation, enhancing the application process with a touch of indulgence. The organic formula boasts SPF 30, providing reliable protection against both UVA and UVB rays, crucial for preventing sunburn and long-term skin damage. What sets this sunscreen apart is its lightweight texture, which absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. This feature is particularly appealing for those who dislike the heavy feeling often associated with sunscreen application. The spray mechanism ensures effortless and even coverage, making it convenient for reapplication throughout the day, especially during outdoor activities. Furthermore, the use of organic ingredients adds to its appeal for those who prioritize natural  products. 

 In conclusion, the COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a luxurious and effective sun protection solution for those who appreciate both quality and indulgence in their routine."
63,neutrogena,ultra sheer lightweight sunscreen spray spf 45,pimprod2032286,2595099," * This is an all in one product. I use it during the day for the sun protection and the glow it gives. You want to spray generously and not skim out on it. The scent is also not too overpowering. * Just no * Beautiful not greasy I buy this over and over try it you won't be disappointed * This gets everywhere oily. You absolutely cannot use it inside or your floors will be slick. I still burn reapplying this too. * Wore this, let it set, and got in pool. 15 minutes later I was blue from the pools paint. This thinned it, removed it, and stuck it to my body while destroying the pools paint. * It was working okay but after 3 weeks of using it almost everday I started to develop rashes. They were circular (kinda likr cigarette burns) reddish, and flaky. They get itchy sometimes. I know it is this product because this is the only new one I've used. Now I don't know what to do with all these rashes and skin damage I've sustained. * Great hand spray type top instead of those one finger kind of press button things. The hand grippy spray allows for easier application in hard to reach areas."

65,tula,protect + glow daily sunscreen gel broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2016249,2562776," * Gosh I love that it has clean ingredients but its like rubbing oatmeal covered in oil on your skin. It just sits like a layer of grease on your face. I want to love because of the clean ingredients but it's just not a usable product. * This product when I first applied it, it feels like cottage cheese (which is fine) just something I noticed. When you rub it it in looks okay(very greesy and shinny) as the day goes on it will start to peel. I would touch my face and the sunscreen would come off on my finger. I bought it on 8/21 and am returning it as I write this on 8/22. * First time using was on a day i mowed my lawn so i thought maybe that caused the skin around my eyes to sting, burn, dry out & peel. After a weeklong battle to get my skin healthy again, i used this sunscreen again with the same results but worse...burning, stinging, dried skin near my eyes especially but all over my face that will now take at least a week to return to healthy by peeling off. Never again. * This sunscreen has been a repeat for several years now. It's the only sunscreen that doesn't make me look ashy or oily. I have darker skin that is acne prone and this has been my Holy Grail. 

It gives me a beautiful glow while still offering protection. I love it. I can also use it with make out or alone for a flawless glow. 

My only con people be the smell, since it's a clean product, I noticed that there is a slight smell to it. Not horrible but it's there. It seems to fade after a while. * This product has become part of my daily routine when I go out. Feels super light on my skin and looks great under makeup. Never have an issue with this sunscreen and this is my fourth time purchasing. Just wish it wasnt so expensive. * I do like this moisturizing sunscreen. Pairs well with all my other products! * This was always my go to. I loved it until recently. Half way through my 3rd bottle and the sunscreen now has a different consistently and is pilling everytime. It's not expired and was not expecting this especially for the price. Won't be repurchasing and would not recommend."
66,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen body spf 40 invisible sun protection,pimprod2038031,2606364," * I was so excited when I found this sunscreen. I received a sample size for my face and used the whole bottle. It was great! Then I bought the body sunscreen for my vacation and after the first use I realized what an expensive mistake it was. It didn't absorb well and left greasy, chunky residue all over my body. It looked like my entire body was peeling from a bad sunburn. This is a very expensive sunscreen for it to not be usable. I don't want to hang out in a public location looking like my skins peeling and I'm shading chunky skin cells all over a public pool. Gross!! * Goes on light.  Not greasy and doesn't leave white residue like some sunscreens do. * I do really like this sunscreen- it's like a clear gel with a velvety finish (think primer consistency). It's rather expensive though for what you get- considering it's a body sunscreen, this wouldn't even get you through a week at the beach. * No matter which supergoop I try they are heavy greasy they do block the sun but feel horrible * Me gusta mucho, no deja la piel grasosa, te da brillo y protege * Absolutely terrible! I broke out in a rash about an hour after using. Theew it away immediately! * I love the OG unseen sunscreen for my face and its the perfect texture and viscosity. I was hoping this would be too. I hate the lotion texture of others so i was really excited that SG came out witb this. The only problem is that its just oily… it absorbs well and makes my skin feel REALLY SOFT but since i do sweat pretty easily it can feel a bit slick at times. Maybe its the olive oil in it? Or its just too many oils."

This was very white but rubbed in and absorbed well. Dries down quick to a soft powdery feel which is so beautiful to the touch.  No smell, did not irritate my eyes, did not make me break out which is amazing bc I'm sensitive and it's just so light feeling on my skin. My skin looks grade and I absolutely love this! * Loveit * I liked this when I would run because  it doesn't run into my eyes when I sweat but it has an awful white cast and I'm very pale. Does not rub in all the way no matter how long you massage it and is pretty greasy. * Pill , white cast and drying * In my personal experience, with this sunscreen i would say that all the pros that they stated above the reviews, are not true at all. They gave me bumps and a rash, that still have not gone away in over a week. I would not recomend this to anyone who has sensitive skin, because I don't have sensitive skin and it gave me an allergic reaction. * If you are remotely melanated, this is NOT the sunscreen for you (unless you don't care about white cast). Even after rubbing this in really well, the white cast doesn't go away. I do feel like this does a great job preventing sunburn, though. * I really wanted to like this product but it made me smell horrible for days somehow despite saying it was unscented and it left a white cast on me that was extremely hard to blend in. After sweating, you could see the white cast build up more and I was constantly having to rub the sunscreen in."
69,supergoop!,travel size play everyday lotion spf 50,pimprod2044740,2624564," * Im not dirw why more people don't mention what a great facial sunscreen this is.  Not only does it work and protect my skin from the sun, it leaves a slight dewy look all day but not oily! I use it over my moisturizer and them add a little blush and its a perfect no makeup look. Love this ans price is so reasonable. I have sensitive skin and do not breakout with this. * The way this product has a chokehold on me! I slather myself in SPF from head to toe every morning and before any outdoor activities, but could never find a suncreen that didnt get all over my clothes or smell like sunscreen. This product is perfect! It absorbs SO WELL that I put it on before getting dressed and it doesnt rub onto my clothes. It also has a very light and fresh scent that is actually enjoyable. I purchase this in every size so I always have one on me, but the pump is great for the bathroom counter! * Skin irritation occured after using this product. I didn't even want to give it one star! It has some sort of scent, citrus maybe in the product, but doesn't specify that anywhere om the packaging. Wouldn't recommend this product to anyone! * I love this sunscreen and love that it comes in this big jug. I don't understand why all other brands only have small sizes when we are suppose to use a good amt daily. I love that there is nonwhite cast. It blends into my skin and although it's pricey I do t have to buy sunscreen every other week now. * Not fungal acne safe 
Smaller than expected 
No white cast * The best body sunscreen I've ever used. I have very pale skin and burn easily. I applied and reapplied this sunscreen before being at the beach for hours and didnt burn at all. * I'm new to sunscreens and have been on the hunt for one that has PA++++ without a white caste that does not sting my eyes, and this one is it! Also smells great as well. A little expensive, but worth it."

71,la roche-posay,anthelios uv correct spf 70 daily face sunscreen with niacinamide,pimprod2030180,2591831," * I like it for most part... but if you sweat, or rub your eyes, it burns for a really long time. * I purchased this product three times. The first time was great i fell in love instantly, it was greasy, it dried down beautifully and it was great under makeup. Not to mention 70SPF?? Heck ye! So i bought it a second time and i used it for the first few months no problem, and then my eyes started to water..not sting, just water. And i thought hm well thats weird cant be my sunscreen cause ive been using it with no issues, and i was running out so i think purchased my third and final bottle and oh my gods when i tell yall my eyes BURNED. Within the first month of purchasing my third bottle i had to constantly wash my face because i couldnt keep my eyes open. But again, it couldnt have been the sunscreen right?? So for the next weeks i isolated my skincare products and all were perfectly fine…except for this sunscreen. By this time it was too late to return it so in the trash it sadly went. Ive never been so heartbroken, if they changed their formula or if my skin just got allergic to it over time i dont know. Im on the search for a new perfect sunscreen, wish me luck. * I have oily to combination skin and this product is not sweat proof or water proof as stated in the description. I will say this product did correct my darkspots and protected my skin. The lotion does need to be rubbed in and does peel after the second hour but the protection is present. I can only wear inside my house due to it being hot and me being sweaty. * It burned my eyes. I didn't put around eye area. I really wanted to love this spf 70, but it was too hard to work with. left face drier than before I put it on. I had to return it. * I wish I could love this product more; unfortunately, every time I apply this product it would irritate my eyes. Of course, I tried to avoid eye area, but still a few minutes after the application, my eyes would be irritated. If you have sensitive eyes, I would not recommend it. * This sunscreen is sheer and I like it very much. Sadly, it's one that creeps up into my eyes and burns. * This is a hard review to write because in a lot of ways its exactly what I'm looking for: moisturizing, has spf, gentle. The big reason I wouldn't buy it again is it melts into my eyes and stings terribly. Ive actually had to pull off the road barely able to keep my eyes open another second with a waterful of tears (product induced— not weeping) making the whole situation worse. It must not happened to everyone, which is why I gave it for stars. It just doesn't work for me."
72,la roche-posay,anthelios kids gentle sunscreen face and body lotion spf 50,pimprod2037033,2608258," * It looks horrible on my skin. I have used it on different occasions and it always happens the same. Don't waste your money. * By far the best sunscreen out there! I used it daily for a 3 week trip throughout Italy during a heatwave and didn't get burnt despite me being fair as can be and outside the majority of the day. Will always buy again!!! * I purchased this product because the ingredients list showed that it did not include Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene. However, when I received the product, this sunscreen does include these ingredients which are NOT reef safe and is banned from parts of Hawaii. Will be returning. Please update the ingredients to include everything."
73,neutrogena,purescreen+ tinted mineral sunscreen,pimprod2037357,2606100," * Over the summer I wanted a tinted sunscreen to wear in lieu of foundation. I love that this is affordable, comes in a variety of shades (I sometimes mix them) and evens out my skintone while giving me sun protection.  I am in my late 50's, and not into high fashion cosmetics at this point of my life. But i am into quick makeup that looks natural, and this does the trick (although i still use an under eye corrector).  Some people say its oily. I feel like it gives me a dewy glow. Younger people may not like it, but its good for my generation whose makeup can look cakey due to drier skin. You have to shake up the product before applying which can be messy.  I've found that if I take off the lid and put my index finger over the hole while shaking, there's no mess (a finger keeps the product in the bottle better than the lid does). Also, when traveling, I put a small piece of plastic wrap over the hole, then screw on the lid. Pain in the butt?  A bit. But i like the product so I'll deal with the packaging. * I bought this product to make my morning routine easier, but it applies so oily and runny  that I need to be careful when handling the packaging and applying on my face. It's unwearable without setting powder and the product leaks everywhere. I bought a Medium shade but I'm really a light Medium and it shows that it's not the right shade. * Love the shade range and doesn't break me out or dry me out. * I really wanted to like this.  I have fair skin (120 in Fenty) and the light shade worked well for me.  It might be a tiny bit too dark, but it's so sheer that the color blends away and doesn't leave a line.  This has essentially no coverage, even for a tinted moisturizer so don't expect even light coverage with this.  I could deal with that and just use this as a sunscreen if it were not SO OILY.  It remains tacky and shiny even after letting it sink in for half an hour.  I am in my 40s and have very dry skin.  My skin is so dry that I use face oil with my moisturizer at night so I never thought I would say that a product is too oily.  I thought that my summer daytime moisturizer might be too heavy to use with this tinted moisturizer so I tried it without my normal skin care on bare skin the second time I used it.  It's still a greasy mess on my dry as the Sahara skin and the oil never sinks in.  The tint rubs off and leaves a mess if anything touches your face.  I just don't understand the reasoning behind a greasy, tinted sunscreen with no coverage that leaves color on anything that touches your face. * The sunscreen itself I enjoy and is great for my sensitive skin. However, the tube it comes in, is a mess! The sunscreen is so thin, it really needs to come in a pump style not a squeeze style. I feel like I've lost half of the product already because it leaks out the sides. * 1. I only wear mineral spf - if you can do chemical - i wouldn't recommend this. There are so many elegant chemical formulas, especially in k-beauty! 
2. This stuff IS moisturizing and doesn't really dry down. great for dry skin or when set with powder- but i wouldn't recommend to oily girlies. 
3. Its  VERY runny- so make sure to shake it before applying. The packaging gets pretty messy for that reason - i think a dropper bottle would be perfect. 

I use this when my skin needs moisture, like after retinol or AHA. Im pretty pale and the tint is perfect. All universal tinted spfs are too orange for me. 

While i don't this daily, I really do like it and find it's been a staple for my dry or sensitive days. * this oily soup of a sunscreen should not be appearing in the ""CC cream"" or other searches for ulta. to say it's tinted is a farse, it is slightly in appearance to be non-white. it is also the oiliest, runniest cosmetic I have ever encountered. I have dry skin and couldn't even absorb it after many attempts at blending (which then eliminated any coverage it provided). the end feel was disgusting and greasy and it gave acne within 24 hours. also, the packaging doesn't seal well. in just one day it seeped out into my makeup bag. Just awful all around."
74,vacation,classic lotion spf 50 sunscreen,pimprod2037341,2606406," * someone else already said it but idk how theres any good reviews on this lol. it just pills and falls off your body and hands as you're applying it. theres residue all over my bathroom floor I wish I was being sarcastic * Currently my favorite body chemical sunscreen on the market, and I am admittedly hard to please when it comes to sunscreens in this country. Hydrating, smells divine, and doesn't irritate my skin in the slightest. Also, I have to give kudos to their graphic design/marketing team because the deliciously retro packaging is what led me to purchasing it in the first place. * I love the way this sunscreen makes my skin look and feel. It dries down to a satin powdery finish that feels great on skin, and leaves it looking moisturized. It has a subtle warm sent, that doesnt bother me even though I don't typically like fragrance. The only issue is that it pills over the skincare I use on my face. So it isn't as universal in its application as I would like. It lays fine over body lotion though. So I'll still use it. * Pills like crazy! I only applied it once and it pilled everywhere. * This behaves just like every other sunscreen you could buy, and has the same problems. Greasy, leaves a weird feeling on the skin and pills like crazy. * I wish i had read the reviews of this product before purchasing it. It pills evey single time it is applied and does not work as an spf. The only positive is that it smells nice. I would not recommend purchasing this product. * I've been looking for a body sunscreen that I could wear all day and not feel sticky or look ghastly. This is perfect. It doesn't leave a white cast and it feels like putting on a body lotion. It smells good, still like sunscreen, but isn't too much."
75,bali body,hydrating natural watermelon tanning oil spf15,pimprod2043239,2619272," * LOVED this! The only thing I hate about this product is how small the bottle is other than that 10/10. I'm pretty light skin like light-medium in foundations and when I used this product I was pretty bronzed. It gives an amazing tan. * So the bottle is the size of a credit card. Ive never seen anything like this, its so hilarious. Why would they make any body product this tiny? Im laughing in disbelief at this bottle. If i used the entire bottle it would maybe cover one of my legs. And im thin. * This product works the way it's intended. Excels your tan, I put this only on my legs when sun bathing and I could feel the product warming up and working. Smell is great. Water resistant didnt come off easily. 
Only downside is its a little pricey for the amount you get, I took a photo of the bottle for reference and I have little baby hands. * Im so annoyed about this purchase, for some reason, no matter how many times I came back, I thought this was more then a tannig oil, I thought it also left a bronze glow. That being said, the bottle is way to small, it also says to use another spf with the product to protect your skin. Its a lovely product but for the amount you receive ans having to use another product with it, its not worth the purchase. Save your money * This product does work abaoultoey wonderul im a very pale person and rbis prsoxut has gave me rhe best tan with no burn but the bottle is really small ive only used it three times and its almost out * I bought this on a whim to try as i was desperate for any sun tanning solution and let me say this has been an unexpected winner! I used it while at a water park hoping to get my backside even and my legs to match my arms. This product has worked better then I could've ever imagined. It smells amazing, a little goes a long way, and it gets you a very nice even tan all throughout your body wherever you use it. I did go ahead and layer the product first having it as my base then a layer of sunblock and then I topped it off with another layer on top. If there was only one thing I could complain about, it would be the amount that you get for the price. While a little does go along way. I just don't know if the price offsets everything else. * The bottle is freaking tiny for 23 dollars. i shouldve looked at the ounces but the bottle just looked bigger in the picture. im not sure how good it is ive only used it once but it smells good"
76,vacation,studio tone spf 50 bronzing drops for face,pimprod2044961,2623028," * This is the holy grail of face bronzers!! the perfect color, not streaky, and contains SPF. * i dont write reviews. I'm writing this because i  never want this product to be discontinued!!!!!! My sensitive and acne prone skin loves it. It gives me a beautiful glow, protects my skin, and leaves it feeling soft and nourished but not greasy. It wears so beautifully under my foundation or alone! * This is not an incentivized review. I purchased this product with my own money.

While this product has potential, it misses the mark for me. First, the color is too dark for my lighter complexion. I'm right between light and medium skintone and this looks way too dark on me if i use more than 2-3 drops. I think it'd work nicely on darker skintones, though. Because I have to use this so sparingly, I'm not getting the SPF benefits, nor am I getting much skincare benefit, so i still have to use a regular sunscreen in addition. Thus, these shade drops end up being an additional step in my routine and not a product that can replace other products i already use. 

On the plus side, it does leave a nice glow, applies nicely to the skin or mixes well with foundation, and had a pleasant scent that dissipates after application. The packaging is luxe and the quality overall is what I'd expect from this great brand. It'd be great to see Vacation come out with a lighter shade of these drops! * These bronzing drops give you the most natural, smoothest tan. Super nice formula and nice packaging! Worth every single dollar. * Maybe its because I have oily skin but this made my skin feel so gross. I mixed it with my moisturizer like I do the drunk elephant drops and this makes me feel like I had a MASK on. It was heavy, sticky and oily. The color was decent and it's cool toned with no shimmer but that's where the positives end for me. I had to wash this off my face and start over bc I couldn't stand how it felt. * Maybe its because I have oily skin but this made my skin feel so gross.

I love the design but the serum ends up on the thread of the screw top of the bottle when you try to neatly put it away. I dislike losing little bits of the serum to the lid, it's messy. The actual formula & package graphic art is amazing. I also have 40s skin & the formula is forgiving & looks nice on my normal to dry skin."

78,clinique,superdefense city block broad spectrum spf 50 daily energy + face protector primer,pimprod2014019,2560146," * The formula is lightweight and I love the slight tint. * I love Clinique products and am especially pleased with this cream so that I can ride the motorcycle without getting too much sunburn on my face and forehead. * I have very sun sensitive skin & love this product.  On busy days I use this on top of a face setum & moisturizer, then add face powder & Im out the door.  Also takes liquid foundation well.  Im actually here looking to buy my 2nd tube.  I have rosacea that causes acne & this product was not irritating to my face.  Big win! * Now that summer is here, I don't go anywhere without it! I used to sparingly in the winter but now that we are in full sun days its a must! Its not to thick or greasy. Its blends into my skin beautifully and my makeup last all day! It does a great job of hiding and protecting my dark spots to make sure they dont get worse or more gets added to my face. Keep this product around forever please! The 50 is my jam! Sensitive skin commemter here! :) * Tried it in store per the clinique associate and I really like it! It is on the thicker side but it spreads nicely and doesnt pill when paired with clinique moisture surge 100H or peach and lily's matcha moisturizer (my two HG moisturizers). You need your moisturizer to dry for 15 minutes and THEN apply your spf, this dramatically reduces it from pilling. It does look very orange when dispensed but it gives me a great sheer tint that looks like I put makeup on, its beautiful! So I wear alone typically on non-makeup days but does work very well as a primer as well (I use IT cosmetics CC+ foundation in light warm medium. For reference, I am also WN04 Bone in Clinique even better makeup so light/med and the tint works great for me. Wish it came in a bigger bottle! As it is pricy when you apply the standard 1/4tsp. * Im sooooo impressed with this product! I only need a little and i blend a small amount of foundtaion for a sunkissed look. I will not be running out of this all year round! Woohoo * Can't get over the tacky texture - not expected at this price point.  I'll be going back to the Shiseido sunscreen - still haven't found anything better.  Really disappointed."

80,drunk elephant,umbra mineral cream spf 30 tinted face sunscreen,pimprod2045266,2622999," * I do like the color of this sunscreen. It gives the skin a nice tint and hides minor blemishes. However, the texture is awful. It's so gritty. I have not been able to get over it. I used up about half the bottle and ended up throwing it away. * I love the color of this product, the fact that it is actually 100% mineral (no hidden chemicsl filters) like most sunscreens and that it is 2oz vs 1.7oz. However, this is suppsoed to go on smooth but when I rub it in initially or even during the day, it is gritty. Assuming its the sea salt in the formula. Why even put this in? You dont need it. There is no necessary benefit to it and ruins the product. I bought this despite the other reviews stating this and now im disappointed. Should have listened! * I bought this product hoping to use it instead of concealer for the summer time and for the first couple if days it worked really well. The problem was after a week of using it my skin began to break out. It may be because I have more of a oily skin type that caused the issue but after not having it on for a couple of days my skin went back to normal. * I bought thus because it was being talked about everywhere. Definitely overhyped. I like the Clinique City Sunblock better. Color, effectiveness, overall feel. Drunk Elephant isn't it for me. * This formula is perfect. I wear it daily. It makes my skin glow! Good to use alone or under makeup. Doesnt clog pores. Will always have on hand. * I never write reviews but I have loved all of Drunk Elephant's products so far, and live on the bronze and glow drops. I was so excited for this product but found it goes on thick, feels heavy and doesn't blend well or have good coverage. Save your money! * I was so excited that this brand has a tinted SPF but I got it and it was the worst SPF I've ever used. It is SO THICK and drying that I have to mix it with moisturizer for it to spread across my face. I will not be purchasing  this product again unfortunately."

I think this would be great for dry skin only. However, i love how it looks under makeup * Odor free, applies on the skin smoothly ,does not leave residue ,does not roll ,feels very natural .I have been using it for 2 weeks and highly recommend the product.Most definitely will buy it again. * I love this brand but this produnt make my face look so oily and greasy. * I have sensitive skin and one of the main reasons I purchased this sunscreen was because it was suitable for sensitive skin. Its not. Although I do love rhe texture and it does leave no white cast and is hydrating, it emphasized redness on my cheeks and thats where im more sensitive. I did see notice little breakouts since I started using this sunscreen.  Will be returning. * I wanted to like this due the price and reviews were good. For me, it just sits on top of my skin. All day. Long. Very greasy and gives my face an unwelcomed sheen. * I loved Ulta and have been a huge fan. Unfortunately with this order I've taken a step back. I paid over double the price I should have paid. I didn't get the discount bc they were out of stock and never said anything except it was canceled. * I did order 2 and one the caps were missing but idk💀"
82,vacation,classic spray spf 30 sunscreen,pimprod2032500,2595586," * It smells good but I now have a giant pimple-y rash across my back and chest where I reapplied this sunscreen. Pretty bummed since this is one of the few reef safe sprays they sell in stores at Ulta. * I used this product as directed and religiously while out. I now look like a tomato and have sun poisoning. Don't waste your money * I used this sunscreen recently at an amusement park and it was 90s the whole time. Good news is that I didn't get burnt but I felt sticky the whole day. It was pretty uncomfortable. I would buy again if there was a dry touch option. * Unfortuately this product pilled a lot and was not sweat resitant for me. Dissappinted :( * perfect sunscreen for wandering the city, hiking, just sitting outside, not greasy which is so major, smells unique in a good way * I was excited to try this based on all the rave reviews. I guess the smell was ok. After getting out of the water, I found the product turned into a white film. Also pilled with reapplication. Can't say if it was effective against burning because I switched to another brand mid afternoon due to the pilling. * Vacation products are ALL great. I have them all! The sprayer works great, the smell is amazing, I've seen mixed reviews complaining of the ""strong smell""..that is the whole point, the ""Vacation"" smell, if you want non scented buy non-scented!"
83,supergoop!,daily spf starter set for face and body,pimprod2044980,2624465," * It gave me a really bad white cast and I was left looking like Casper the Ghost. Also, it broke me out and blurred my vision a bit. After a couple of minutes, I noticed that my skin was turning red. It was so bad that I had to wash it off. * Used 2 for gifts for my daughters teachers and kept the 3rd for myself. It feels so weightless on my face, no grease and great coverage. A recurring buy for me"
84,vacation,super stick spf 45 face stick sunscreen,pimprod2044959,2623030," * This stick glides like magic over my face! It's not sticky, not greasy, not stinky...it's great * Why is this product marketed for use at the pool but it is not water resistant? I read reviews and did a google search to be sure it was water resistant before ordering, but upon receiving it, the packaging states to use a water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating. Idk anyone going to the pool that does not intend to sweat and/or swim?? Also the smell is very chemical heavy, like a public restroom.

I do however love the teardrop shape for application and the non-heavy/greasy formula. Vacation, please make a water-resistant version!!! * My only negative comment about this product is the packaging. The lid is SO hard to remove. Other than that, it is very lightweight and not greasy at all. * This sunscreen doesn't leave a white cast, had an easy application, and didn't leave my skin greasy. * I really love this sunscreen stick! I found it looks really nice alone or under makeup. I really have been loving the finish it leaves on my skin, and the sp45 and smell are really nice bonuses! * I love the shape of the sunscreen stick. It's pointed on one end so it's easy to get under the eye area and on the nose. However, I find this formula very dry and difficult to apply. I have to press very hard in order to get the product on my face simply because it is not emollient enough. Luckily the formula doesn't disturb my makeup underneath. It works but I will probably not purchase this again. * I don't hbderstand all the good reviews. Maybe I got a bad batch. It did not glide on easily, you have to apply pressure so if you're wearing makeup it will get messd up. It also leaves my face feeling sticky to the point that my hair sticks to my face. It feels like I put a gluestick or Chapstick on my face."
85,coola,classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 30 tropical coconut,pimprod2030786,2592674," * The is one of three sun related products that I started to use last year.  Jess; one of our managers told me about the results.  Its great for the environment and I did not burn. Last year is the first time that I did not burn in all my years going to the New Jersey beach.  I love it so much; I purchase it for the people I love. * To fair skin individuals… this did not protect me from getting burned. Was out in sun for 90 minutes (not in water), reapplied and still burned. * This tropical coola sunscreen is to die for! The smell reminds me of a beach tropical resort with coconuts and pina coladas. The spray settles perfectly on my skin and doesn't leave a cast or residue like most sunscreens I use do. I highly recommend trying this sunscreen. The fact that it's clear is amazing to me, I can only use clear. The smell is so tropical and beachy. I can't wait to wear this sunscreen all summer long. I used this on my son as well and he is 5, and it worked very well. This Coola sunscreen is going to be my go to this summer. If you haven't tried this sunscreen yet, run & add it to your cart! I'll be purchasing another once this one runs out and probably even get on for my mom. This tropical coconut sunscreen is my new favorite product! Product was received as part of an educational promotion. * Coola clear sunscreen is awesome I live the smell and also love how it doesn't make your skin feel greasy or leaving you with a white hue! The packaging is gorgeous and I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone! Everything about this product is awesome. * I absolutely loved the COOLA Tropical Coconut Clean Sunscreen Spray SPF 30! The scent is a dreamy, beachy coconut that instantly transports you to paradise. The formula is incredibly moisturizing, leaving my skin feeling soft and hydrated without any greasy residue. It sprays on evenly, absorbs quickly, and provides great sun protection with its SPF 30. I also appreciate that it's made with clean ingredients, making it a great choice for everyday use. Whether at the beach or running errands, this sunscreen keeps my skin glowing and protected. I  will definitely be using this all the time here in sunny miami. I'm so happy I discovered this great spf to add to my skin care regimen. This product was gifted as  part of  an educational promotion. * The COOLA 30 Clear Sunscreen Spray in Tropical Coconut is a summer must-have! It feels super lightweight, absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave a greasy finish. The tropical coconut scent is subtle and refreshing. Love that it's reef-safe and packed with skin-nourishing ingredients. Perfect for everyday sun protection! * The COOLA 30 Clear Sunscreen Spray in Tropical Coconut is a summer must-have!

So far, this has been the best sunscreen for my dry skin. Goes on white but dissolves with a little massaging. Doesn't feel heavy nor does my skin feel dry at the end of the day. My skin feels soft after using Blue Lizard (sensitive).  I've tried many, many sunscreens over many years, but this one is the only one I will continue to buy on a regular basis. * Coming from an esthetician who has tried MILLIONS of sunscreens- this is one of my favorites. Its comparable to more expensive brands for way less! * I purchased because i had heard great things about this but it is not for me.. leaves a horrible purple like cast on my face and have to rub pretty hard to lather it around * Overall, a good product. My only issues were that it seens to rub off easily, it's hard to wash off  with just soap, and it has a white cast. * I don't know how well it protected me from the sun but I do not like this sunscreen. Has huge white cast, oily and my face felt stifled after applying this product. I have mixed skin and fair skin tone, but this product just made me look unnaturally white. * I don't like the smell at all id prefer banana boat supergoop , coola , vacation brand , for sure.!! Or laroche posay my other fav!! All the other brands i mentioned are good!! * If you are looking for clean sunscreen look no further"
87,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen spf 40,pimprod2029930,2589386," * I like this product didnt really have a problem with it, its just that i dont like how it feels on my skin. As someone with combination skin it would leave a matteish finish but after a few minutes i wouldn't see that matteiah finish and my glow would comeback. Some people like that glowy look but its just not for me because of my skin type and my preference. Good product just not for me. * I like this product didnt really have a problem with it, its just that i dont like how it feels on my skin.

Some people like that glowy look but its just not for me because of my skin type and my preference. Good product just not for me. * The Ulta Unseen Sunscreen SPF 50 which I received complimentary from Supergoop feels like a primer yet has the protection of a sunscreen.  I love it because it is beneficial for my skin as it diminishes pores and allows for smoother makeup application.   The formula is unique and stands out because of its performance.   I highly recommend especially for traveling and busy days. * This is my all time favorite sunscreen. It is so great for everyday and using underneath makeup. It doesnt pill or change the texture of my makeup. Its weightless and it doesnt leave a white cast. Obsessed! Gifted by supergoop * It's good, just not worth money or intrigues me anymore. Burns eyes, makes skin slightly irritated. Wouldn't buy because there's better for sale out there. * I really like this sunscreen. I buy this size, because I think it is too expensive. * i've struggled with finding a face sunscreen for decades. i'll never look elsewhere. feels so good when it goes on (smooth!) and disappears instantly. isn't shiny, isn't matte, doesn't have any sort of cast. no weird smell. makes a great base for makeup and washes off easily."
88,kiehl's since 1851,better screen uv serum sunscreen spf 50+,pimprod2042679,2617292," * Leaves my skin a little to dewy for my preference. I can and will use it on days when I may be using a more matte foundation. Maybe a little powder but at 67 I tend not to use setting powder unless I'm very shiny. * Goes on great, rubs in even better with a slight glow to the skin. Great product! The only downside is companies are getting a little greedy with quantity vs. cost. Just because it's for the face is not a reason to charge so much and this goes for many of the branded companies not just specific to Kiehls! * Has horrible ingredients including some banned by the EU.  Might as well put cheap Bannna boat sunscreen on your face.  Of course it doesn't leave a white sheen it doesn't contain zinc or titanium dioxide which are the mineral sunscreen ingredients that do. * I love this product * I have oily/acne prone skin. This worked without adding more oil and shine to my face * A friend recommended this, and I am so glad she did.  I do not like most face sunscreens, but this is great, even at the beach.  I did reapply and wore a hat and sunglasses, but was amazed with the protection.  My eyes are sensitive and have had issues in the past with sunscreens stinging.  This did not do that at all.  Highly recommend! * I wanted to write a second review. I just bought this for the third time and im still obsessed. I use this after i let my moisturizer since in for like 5-10 mins. It glides right on and doesnt pill. I love this under makeup because i feel like it gives me such a healthy glow underneath that makes my makeup look even better. I love this when im not wearing makeup as well because it just gives such a great glow. Id you are having any issues with pilling it could just be reacting to other products you have. This is the ONLY product ive never had an issue with"
89,blue lizard australian sunscreen,sensitive mineral sunscreen spray spf 50+,pimprod2043671,2621975," * I've bought 2 sprays sunscreens from this brand this year and they have both stopped spraying after 1-2 uses. Product is no good if you cant use it. * If you want a clean sunscreen look
No further * No other sunscreen spray (with zinc) compares to this one. The mist is very fine and non-greasy. On my second bottle and will continue to purchase. * Not only was it effective, I didn't get that sticky,  gnarly feel on my skin, nor did it make my skin break out. Really great stuff. I would definitely recommend it to friends and will certainly be purchasing this product again. I was extremely pleased with it. * I really wanted to like this more. I love spray sunscreens but this was a waste of money. The nozzle stopped working after just a few uses. * I don't usually leave reviews, but I was super disappointed in this one.  The nozzle stopped working almost immediately, I didn't even get one leg fully covered before it clogged up.  Luckily I had a backup lotion with me. Other Blue Lizard products have been great. * I would say this product is a firm no for me as I PERSONALLY experienced a minor allergic reaction on my arms and it made them really itchy with small bumps. I had high hopes it would work fantastically as it's mineral with high spf but it's unfortunately a no for me :("
90,kinship,self reflect probiotic moisturizing sunscreen spf 32,pimprod2017785,2569946," * I was looking forward to trying this product because I always prefer mineral sunscreens, but I didn't even open it and test it because I noticed immediately that the product had expired in March 2025 and I received it today on June 27, 2025. That is unacceptable. So I will be making a trip to the store to return it, along with another product that arrived in my order from Ulta that was an eye cream which had completely dried out. What is going on Ulta? * I am allergic to chemical sunscreen, so I have to buy mineral only. This one is lightweight feeling on the skin, leaves my skin feeling soft and not sticky throughout the day, and it doesn't smell of traditional sunscreen. It does leave somewhat of a white cast but once I put on some blush and bronzer I don't see a difference. This sunscreen is definitely one I recommend to my friends and family. * This sunscreen leaves the healthiest glow on my skin and does not cause breakouts. I'm on my third tube and just bought anothrr. I love the Kinship vitamin c eye cream and serum as well. * I should have stuck with my tried and true Kinship Mineral Sunscreen! It is now my holy grail after 3 years of use. It glides on nice and reapplication is easy, after the 3rd application it does get oily on me.I wash my face before a 4th application. I highly recommend for sensitive skin and those looking for great ingredients that do not irritate. I have mature skin and only when my skins need more hydration I will put this sunblock over my moisturizer and they both work well with each other. No complaints. I tell everyone who needs a good sunscreen to try Kinship Mineral sunscreen. Please do not change ingredients! * I have been using this sunscreen for years and really like it for my face. I just purchased this in store with my Ulta points and realized after I purchased that it expired in September 2024. I went back into the store and they only had 2 others and both were expired.  The cashier said she could order me another online which I had to pay full price for and then bring back into the store and exchange it.  Not to my surprise the one I was sent in the mail is also expired.  Very disappointing. Ulta should damage out expired products. * It's on the thicker side, so very moisturizing. It has a pleasant smell and leaves the face looking quite dewy. No white cast. * I love the dewy look this sunscreen creates on my face, and it wasn't bad to apply this on my face although I felt like I had to rub a bit more than I usually do with my Kbeauty sunscreens to get it to blend. BUT the vanilla smell is just too strong. At first, I thought the smell was pleasant, but then I started smelling this on my skin throughout the day, hours after application, and I was self-conscious about smelling like a cookie. I tried finishing this product in an effort not to be wasteful (because of my skincare consumerist habits), but I just couldn't."

92,neutrogena,clear face oil-free sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2021433,2576185," * I've been using this sunscreen everyday for about a week now. Every time I use it, it pills immediately, and I can't even put makeup on after applying. I'm going to try it on my chest/body next, and if it still pills then I'll probably get rid of it. It also smells like motoroil to me which is unpleasant haha * I love the Neutrogena sunscreen sm. I've been using them for about a year and I have not got one sunburn on my face since using them and they last all day! They do leave a little glow on the skin but it isn't greasy or oily and they are very lightweight and no white cast! Really good drugstore facial sunscreen! * For reference I am a late 20's female with oily skin and jawline hormonal acne. 

This product didn't work for my face at all. Its greasy, heavy, and it clogs my pores. When I sweat it does burn my eyes. This product makes my face so greasy I can fry food with it. Even after washing with an exfolianting cleanser, my exfoliating toner still shows traces of residue from this product. 

I havent used it in over a week and my breakouts are clearing out. 

This product does work very well for the body! I especially use it on my tattoos. It's effectiveness still debatable for the body since I try to cober my tattoos majority of the summer. * It works fine on my skin but if you get it anywhere near close to your eyes prepare for your eyes to be burning and watering for the next 3 hours. I can also taste it in the back of my mouth which i dont think is normal. * Burned my face and made me break out. It caused my skin to flake off and my makeup look cakey... yes i let it set in. Made my skin look and feel oily. Would not recommend. * It's not greasy, doesn't break me out, and sits well on top of vaseline or jojoba oil that I use for my face. Personally my eyes are fine but some reviews say it stings for them. * This is a good sunscreen if you have really oily skin. It absorbs quickly and is quite drying. It has silica in it which makes sense. I have combo skin so this leaves my skin dry which is why it is not for me. However I saw a lot of comments about pilling, this sunscreen has silicone in it to keep it oil free. Be careful when using this to not mix it with water based products that is why it pills. Or let it sink into the skin completely before applying other products."
93,avÃ¨ne,mineral tinted compact spf 50,pimprod2020808,2577170," * I would love this product if there were ligher shades available. The shades they currently have make me look like an oompa loompa. * This product exceeded my expectation. It makes my morning super easy with a two in one with SPF and foundation in one. Gorgeous tone and full coverage! Huge plus thag it doesnt clog pores. * I love this compact powder for its sun protection factor, it has very good coverage, it is creamy, for my complexion it is perfect * If your skin is oily, and you love having a base every day, this is for YOU! Love the shade (I am a light tone in foundation) and this fits perfect. For both seasons.. Easy to retouch, with a mirror to carry wherever. * If you're not wearing a full face of makeup, this is a great way to reapply SPF during the day on the go without having to get product all over your hands or needing to touch your face. Initially I thought the beige looked way too dark (I'm a light warm-neutral) but once you spread it on your skin it lightens up considerably and looks like a tinted moisturizer with light coverage. If I squint hard enough there is a very faint white cast, but it's barely noticeable. All in all if either shade works for you it's a great hands-free light coverage daytime SPF reapplication tool that will stay in my purse! * I do like the quality of the compact and the creamy texture made it easy apply.  I also was very pleased that it has SPF.  However, the color is a bit darker than I thought it would be.  I would only purchase again if it was available in a lighter color. * This is thick and immediately settles into any lines and wrinkles you might have. The lighter shade has a bit of an orange hue on my fair/light skin. It looks just awful. It might have good sun protection, but I wouldn't want to wear this around other humans who can see my face."
94,coola,dew good illuminating serum sunscreen with probiotic technology spf 30,pimprod2030633,2591991," * After about 3 months of using this pretty regularly, one day after coming in from outside my face was tingling. I washed my face and under my makeup it was so red it was almost purple. My neck was itching and burning horribly. My skin was raised and red and radiating heat like a horrible sunburn.  I'm talking ""been outside for 8 hours in the tropics, in the sun with no sunblock"" sunburn. Over the next few days, my swollen and red face went to dry, painful to the touch, covered in tiny bumps and peeling. My neck continued to be red and itchy for almost a week. I used aloe Vera gel, ice packs, nothing helped. I couldnt figure out what caused it and though it mightve been a food allergy, since id already been using this product for 2-3 months with no issues. About 5 months of winter went by where i used a regular face sunblock (not this one) and i had no problems. Took this bottle out last week and used it in the morning before putting on my makeup—same reaction. I realized that was not a coincidence and that thinking back, i had been using this product each time i had this reaction last summer and fall (about 4 times). I went to the one star reviews on this product and low and behold—other peoole have had the exact same reaction. Litterally exact same reaction with all the same symptoms. It seems that theres an ingredient in this that destabilizes over time and causes severe chemical burn reactions. I cant believe that somethjng like this is even allowed to be sold. This is TERRIBLE that a reputable brand would not reformulate or recall this product. If you have this product id recommend immediately disposing of it and writing COOLA to advise of their unsafe product.  I have used COOLA body sunblock for years with no issues, but after this I no longer trust this company with ANYTHING that goes on my face. Theres not a ton of the same reactions listed here in the reviews but I promise you it's because people are experiencing but can't figure out what it's from. Absolutely do not purchase this product. * Thank goodness for the negative reviews that came before mine - I am relieved to have ID'd the ingredient I reacted so horribly to! I bought and used this product in the summer without any issue. Gives a beautiful finish (though I did experience some white caste but only along my jawline/neck for some reason). Loved it and wore it daily in the summer months but used another sunscreen come fall. I decided to give it a whirl about five months after I purchased it and was greeted with a terrible reaction - swollen bright red face + burning and itching sensations lasting several days. I tried it again a couple months later to confirm it was the culprit and that it did. It's definitely the bismuth oxychloride and something obviously happened over time to make it more aggravating to those with sensitive skin. Major bummer because it looks great! But definitely causes an awful reaction to those with sensitivity issues. * I love the consistency of this product. I wanted to love this. But it gave me cystic acne :( * I love this sunscreen, it is everything the elf halo glow wanted to be. This is the only product i have used that clears my acne without being a true acne targeting product. It has the most beautiful radiance, and is very lightweight. Once the product is starting to run low, though, the pump becomes hard to use. Other than that is perfect. * I loved this product so much I repurchased another bottle. It gave my skin a soft dewy glow. The formula must have changed between purchases because I developed an incredible itch on my face and neck which included a bumpy rash. I eliminated all current products I was using and added back in slowly and much to my chagrin this was the culprit. If you have sensitive skin, beware. If you don't,  go for it! I am still disappointed I cant use it anymore. * I absolutely adore this sunscreen! I dont like to wear foundation, so this gives me the perfect dewy base without feeling trapped or heavy. * I could NOT recommend this sunscreen more. I've repurchased several times now, and I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear it. It's lightweight but moisturizing, the perfect glowy base for makeup (but also beautiful on its own!), smells luxe and divine, and has the perfect amount of SPF for everyday use. But while the product itself is incredible, I think the packaging needs work. I love the glass for sustainability reasons, but once the product starts to run low, it's incredibly hard to get the pump to work. I can visibly see that there's plenty more product in the container, but the pump won't retrieve it. Once I get to the end I have to unscrew the pump and use a tiny spatula to get the last of it out. This sunscreen is pricey, so I'm definitely trying to get my money's worth here, and the packaging makes it difficult to do so. It's not enough to stop me from buying it because I love this product so much (and I am PICKY about sunscreen), but I do hope COOLA sees this and makes a change soon."

Not only does it work and protect my skin from the sun, it leaves a slight dewy look all day but not oily! I use it over my moisturizer and them add a little blush and its a perfect no makeup look. Love this ans price is so reasonable. I have sensitive skin and do not breakout with this. * The way this product has a chokehold on me! I slather myself in SPF from head to toe every morning and before any outdoor activities, but could never find a suncreen that didnt get all over my clothes or smell like sunscreen. This product is perfect! It absorbs SO WELL that I put it on before getting dressed and it doesnt rub onto my clothes. It also has a very light and fresh scent that is actually enjoyable. I purchase this in every size so I always have one on me, but the pump is great for the bathroom counter! * Skin irritation occured after using this product. I didn't even want to give it one star! It has some sort of scent, citrus maybe in the product, but doesn't specify that anywhere om the packaging. Wouldn't recommend this product to anyone! * I love this sunscreen and love that it comes in this big jug. I don't understand why all other brands only have small sizes when we are suppose to use a good amt daily. I love that there is nonwhite cast. It blends into my skin and although it's pricey I do t have to buy sunscreen every other week now. * Not fungal acne safe 
Smaller than expected 
No white cast * The best body sunscreen I've ever used. I have very pale skin and burn easily. I applied and reapplied this sunscreen before being at the beach for hours and didnt burn at all. * I'm new to sunscreens and have been on the hunt for one that has PA++++ without a white caste that does not sting my eyes, and this one is it! Also smells great as well. A little expensive, but worth it."

97,kopari beauty,travel size sun shield body glow gel spf 50,pimprod2042965,2619700," * I love this little SPF body glow. I wish it was a bit more shimmery but it absolutely gets the job done and is super hydrating. This has become a staple in my travel bag! * This is my new favorite SPF! I do wish the shimmer was a little louder. But regardless this silky smooth oil is so nice. I love how it doesn't feel like gross sunscreen. And it doesn't smell like nasty sunscreen either. I put it on before I leave the house because I did put it on at the lake once and it got milky and I feel like it washed off vs soaking in and protecting me. But I didn't get burnt. I still tanned real nice! Highly recommend * I looove Kopari bodycare. Decided to give this a try, it made my skin look so radiant, smooth and hydrated all day. It smells amazing (i hate the smell of traditional sunscreen). I dont burn easy but I do tan easy and too much sun exposure can make my skin feel really uncomfortable and dry, this kept my skin feeling very comfortable during high sun exposure. I've only tried this casually running around in the summer, i see other reviews that say that they got burned on beach days, I'd have to try this on a beach day but as a casual body sunscreen its very nice * I normally don't write reviews, but for this I felt inclined to. I applied layers of this at the beach. I stayed about one hour and did not get in the water. As seen in the attached photo, I burned horribly. Very disappointing and upsetting. * I bought the Kopari Sunscreen to take on vacation to Las Vegas. I am an African American woman and it is important to me that I protect my skin. This product not only had my skin shiny and looking radiant but it smells so good. It held up in 102 F. * I really wanted to like this product but it didnt work for me I got so sun burnt and I reapplied multiple times. it does smell amazing though. * I love this stuff, it smells great, it's effective and pretty. I wish the product manager and engineers of this stuff would put a better cap on the bottle. It pops off at the slightest touch. The cap shouldn't come off in my bag, over and over again."
98,coola,travel size classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 50,pimprod2012273,2561106," * This is it.  The relentless search for sun protection that actually works has come to halt.  Our family has sensitive, translucent skin and fry in the sun within two minutes.  Someone is always burning!  Coola wins the spray sunscreen.  Didn't expect much from this sunscreen, but I stand corrected.  Gladly!  It's clear, scent is minimal, sprays evenly.  The down side of it us the amount of product for the price.  Not a fan of the price, though.  It's a bit steap, but it is what it is. * Works plus smells good and feels very refreshing during application. * I have easy to burn skin, so I'm always on the hunt for a good sunscreen.  This Coola one is the best so far.  I even forgot to reapply and still didn't burn.  I love that it goes on completely clear and it doesn't feel greasy.  I just wish it was a little more affordable, but it's still worth the money. * The product itself is amazing. Used it 3 times and it is almost empty, for the price it fell like a total rip off * This sunscreen smells totally not. Like .sunscreen. Just smells really fresh and delicious and all while keeping you safe in the sun ! Wow. A tad pricey so I keep it for myself ! * After suffering stinky chemical smelling SPF sprays, I finally tried this brand. Twice the price but so worth it. Smells like heavenly Guava Mango and that's it. It outlasts the 80 minute rec time, is moisturizing and allows for tan with no burn. * Fragrance free. Not sticky or greasy. My skin felt like I hadn't applied sunscreen. My new go to sunscreen spray."
99,shiseido,clear sunscreen stick spf 50+,pimprod2022854,2576053," * (1) I love the size of this stick sunscreen (smaller than my iphone)
(2) Easy to apply on top of foundation without ruining it 
(3) No cast and it blends naturally * I absolutely love this sunscreen stick! I originally bought it for my kiddo who has very sensitive skin—if he gets burned, it's tears and agony, and most sunscreens we've tried either cause stinging or irritation. I've tested so many different brands, and this one has been by far the best for his skin.

It goes on clear, doesn't burn, and provides amazing protection. I'm so relieved to finally have a sunscreen he's comfortable wearing. I'll be buying this over and over again! It's also super convenient to toss in my bag, though I've learned to keep it in my cooler bag on really hot days so it doesn't soften.

Highly recommend for anyone—especially those with sensitive skin. It's a game-changer! * Perfecto for my sensitive skin and most importantly for me, black girl approved no white casting. I have been literally in the hunt for a good quality sunscreen since my go to seem to have changed their formula. Ya'll did your big one with this. * Post/in between biking I can easily apply and after a few minutes it feels like nothings there. The shiseido sunscreens have been incredibly helpful in fading my dark marks, excellent sunscreen that is easy to reapply every two hours and some azelaic acid for the win.

Literally apply at my desk before packing up my stuff to head home so get that PM coverage. * We love this sunscreen. And as a family that has young kids and parents with a history of skin cancers, this is what we use. Non greasy and breathable. I stock up every spring and throughout the summer. * It glides on over makeup without moving it. I had my partner and sister try it over thier makeup and it didnt disturb it. My gfs makeup is dewy and my sisters is matte. Worked for them both. I love it aswell bc it doesnt break me out. This is my second one * Ive bought two of this product now, and love it. Its lightweight, doesn't burn your eyes, and doesn't clog pores. Lasts a long time too!"
100,coola,peach blossom classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 70,pimprod2012875,2561100," * I am pale and burn easily. I usually don't like spray sunscreens as they seem to make me burn more due to the alcohol in them. This one did not- I was actually surprised at how well it worked. I found it to be lightweight and non-greasy. I also liked the smell. I dislike the smell of traditional sunscreens. This one is nice as you can use it daily without worrying about smelling like coconuts. My only negative is that it seems like the can went really fast. I bought the lotion sunscreen too and use the spray for hard to reach areas like my back. This did help extend the life of it but I wish the can lasted longer. * I have used Coola in the past and wanted a 70spf. I broke out severly on my chest and arms - the only areas I applied the spray. I can't imagine anyone using this on their face. The smell is super strong and smells like chemicals. Test on a patch of skin and wait a day before using it. The next day my skin was burning and itchy and the breakout lasted a week. I have used the Coola 50spf unscented lotion without incident. So perhaps its the fragrance? Regardless use with caution. * I tried the Suncare Classic Sunscreen Spray Peach Blossom SPF 70 and was pleasantly surprised by its soft, fruity scent. The spray formula makes application easy, though it leaves a slightly sticky feeling on the skin. It provides solid protection, especially for short periods in the sun.  This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review. * I find this spray to be greasier than other spf 70 sprays I have used. The smell is definitely not ""peachy"". It has a very chemical smell to it. 

Certainly not worth the price! * Im not really a peach scent wearer but this smells perfect when i layer it with anything I wear. Also i usually hate wearinf oily stuff bc i have sensory issues but its not oily and dries fast. * Provides excellent protection. It has a light, clean, fresh, and fruity fragrance. It is lightweight and organic. * COOLA is one of my favorite brands so when I saw they had a 70 SPF I haf to try it. And it is now a constant staple i have. The smell is also nice not too fragramt  and not the typical sunscreen amell"
101,cerave,hydrating sheer sunscreen face and body lotion with spf 30,pimprod2036753,2606576," * This has the worst white cast of any suncreen ive ever used. I am pretty pale and this is still awful. If you have ANY sort of melanin in your skin this will not work for you. Save your $$ * I love this sunscreen as Cera Ve is a respectable skin care company. I tried the Cetaphil sheer mineral sunscreen and it did NOT go on sheer. So, I went back for the Cera Ve. I use it on my arms and chest and neck. I wish I would have started doing that younger as I am 64 and have a lot of aging that can't be reversed : ( * I have sensitive skin. So, I checked the ingredients in an app that double checks ingredients won't break you out. Well it said it was ok. But then it broke me out. Returned it immediately. * I have used this sunscreen about halfway through now and it does what a sunscreen is supposed to do. I feel like it has the same effect as maybe sunscreen lotion you'd take to the beach. I wouldnt buy it again simply because if im putting it in a rush, it wont blend in fast enough. * I was tired of spending so much on daily SPF for my face that came in such small tubes, so I hesitantly gave this a try. Its awesome. Im 22M with bad acne, eczema and sensitive combo skin, so good spf that doesnt burn or break me out is hard to find. This hits all my marks. Lightweight, glowy, no stinging or burning, doesnt clog pores and it has GREAT price per ounce value compared to other SPF. 10/10 forever recommend. * I wasn't impressed with this sunscreen. It was difficult to run in and in areas of my face where I was trying to be gentle and not rub too much, it ended up looking streaky. It also didn't feel very hydrating l. I often had to mix it with water or my CeraVe moisturizer just to get it to mix in well. * This sunscreen works for me and I love it. It comes out thick but applies smooth and thin. It leaves the skin hydrated and can be used under makeup."
102,dime,tinted glow wonderscreen spf 30,pimprod2043028,2621467," * I've been looking for a tinted sunscreen and this was not it. It comes out very thick that it always gets stuck and I end up having to screw off the pump. It has a mild weird smell and the tint I felt gave a orangey hue. I wish I liked this cuz I like other Dime products. For the price point, its just not it. * Gave me skin rash. Looking at ingredients shows Butyloctyl Salicylate a chemical UV filter is not mineral. 0 stars for not being honest about their sunscreen! I do not recommend. * This product had a nice texture to it. Very creamy. On the oily side. The tint part was not really good for me. * I bought this because I needed a new sunscreen and it was good for a day then it started sort of peeling or becoming very noticeable. I started applying it differently and that helped but some spots are still very noticeable. * I have light/medium skin tone and ordered Tint 2. It blends beautifully with my skin and doesn't feel heavy, tacky or drying. Finding a face spf has been tricky for me because chemical sunscreens burn when i apply them and mineral sunscreens seem to suck all of the moisture out of my skin leaving it so dry. This one is perfect leaving a nice glow without looking greasy, irritating my skin or drying it out. * I love how lightweight this product is! Doesnt clog my pores and offers a light coverage. Great for my skin, which is fairly even with a little texture and some discoloration. Product is a little liquidy, if you use too much is gives a ghostly hue. Use less than 1 full pump and looks great and natural! * The product looks amazing on the skin and it's the right consistency and texture.  Love the glow.  The bottle is even beautiful.  But for some reason, it feels like it goes empty fast because of the pump and the container.  It's hard to get out the remaining product.  I love that it's glass because it's better than plastic, but I wonder how we can maximize the product, since it's so little in the bottle already.  Thank you, DIME, for making beautiful, clean skincare and fragrances.  PLEASE don't sell out!  Thank you!!"
103,good molecules,sheer mineral sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2037436,2606130," * This blends onto the skin very well and I didnt have any whitecast. I think it works best when you stick to rest of Good Molecules Daily Essentials box plus the cleanser and use this last. Occasionally I felt a little tingling sensation on my skin after applying but haven't had a reaction or stinging eyes like with chemical sunscreens. My skin tends to be oily and this sunscreen didn't make it shinier than usual so that made me happy. I feel bad others didnt have a good experience with it but it's well loved in my routine. * I have oily skin and my skin gets irritated really fast I don't have this problem with this product * Okay facial sunscreen for the price, it hasnt pilled for me and seemed to blend fine with my skincare but it feels heavy on my skin and it DOES leave a white cast. I'll finish the full tube but I wont be re-purchasing. * I recieved this in my Freebies Bag with my order and was excited to try it.... this excitement quickly died. I rubbed it in fully (slight white cast but I worked it in and it went away) but even after laying out to tan so it would fully soak into my skin, got in the pool and when getting back out, hello Casper the friendly ghost. Streaks of white all over me. Truly can say I've never had anything like that before. I'll finish out what I have cause I hate to waste but absolutely will not be purchasing and wouldn't recommend anyone purchase it. * Not a true Mineral Sunscreen! Good molecules why would you put Chemical Butyloctyl Salicylate or any Salicylates into Sunscreen especially a ""Mineral sunscreen""? This gave me a rash. I do not recommend. And it is not Mineral sunscreen, transparency should be practiced when advertising Mineral when ingredients say otherwise. Don't trust your products anymore. * Live this sunscreen doesnt make me feel greasy at all & leaves no ehote cast, the only thing is i wish it csme in a higher coverage like 50. * I got this as a gift to try out, and personally, I didn't enjoy the product. As someone with a medium skin tone, this suncreen left a pretty noticeable white cast. I also have very dry, eczema prone skin and this left my skin flaky and dry, and kind of itchy afterwards. Overall, just not for me, but it might work if you have a different skin type."
104,supergoop!,glow oil spf 50 dry body oil sunscreen,pimprod2042888,2617634," * I was really psyched to try this as normal sunscreen tends to dry out my skin and I thought the oil would keep my skin hydrated while providing sun protection. It was greasy and smothering. It felt like my skin couldn't breathe or sweat or regulate its temperature because the oil was so thick. It felt almost as if I had longsleeves on, that is how hot and miserable it made me. * I used this on day 1 of my beach vacation, i reapplied every 2 hours and got the worst sunburn I've ever had! I used a different subscreen on my face and it didn't burn at all. The rest of my trip was miserable and painful, I couldnt even enjoy the beach. * I got the worst sunburn of my life after using this ""sunscreen"" 
This stuff may be good for casual everyday sun protection, but absolutely not for extended outdoor use. * use alone or under makeup. Lovely glass skin. * I passed this on underneath my cream foundation (I have dry skin), and my foundation looks flawless, and I have not gotten any extra freckles. It is a beautiful sunscreen I will keep buying it. * I used this while in Trinidad, and I was sunburned so badly. Everyhwere I used this oil is where I burned the most. * This does not feel oily or greasy. It leave a nice refreshing feel like you just put oil on after a shower. Doesnt stain clothes from regukar wear. Smells good. Nice protection from the sun."
105,vacation,spf 30 baby oil,pimprod2038616,2596248," * SPF 30 Baby Oil can protect you from the sun but can also stain ur clothes. * I like to try different products and im very fair skinned but loooove tanning. This stuff is the best. I don't get burnt
... I get brown. * I haven't used this product yet but thought I would just post a ""read the label"" warning...I missed the part about it being 3.5 oz. which seems kind of steep for the price. It's the smallest bottle ever considering how similar they make it look to the real baby oil bottles in the pics. * I used this on my legs in Hawaii and loved it. Made them so glowy and no burn even when I was on the beach all day. I did reapply after I went into the water. The only downfall is the packaging. It leaks no matter how tightly it is closed. If they fix that 5 stars * Bought for a trip to Hawaii, packed in my carry on and met clean standards for snorkeling. * Applies on evenly and makes you looks so glowy and helps you tan so much faster. I love having a tanning oil with spf in it and not have to worry about burns. This is the tannest I've been. * I got this in my Ipsy glam box and jt was chosen for me. I usually don't buy body oils or any products for tanning—I'd rather stick with classic sunscreen and sun protection. I threw this in my suitcase when going to my honeymoon in Cancun and I'm so glad I did! It was moisturizing and also helped with SPF. A little goes a long way."
106,neutrogena,ultra sheer face serum spf 60+,pimprod2030654,2592306," * It was clear, whiched i liked but it burned my face and eyes. Will not repurchase. * This is the least greasy formula I've tried, and there's no white cast. The serum-like consistency is easy to work with compared to thicker lotions. It plays well with my silicone-based primer and tinted serum too! * I waited to review this after i used it for a while. Im not sure why people are saying it burns their eyes, i have not had that experience at all, and i sweat a lot! 

Highly recommend to all who are looking for something moisturizing and lightweight. Doesnt feel thick or greasy!!! Will definitely be repurchasing * I really like this sunscreen because it is light and moisturizing, doesn't pill, feels comfortable on my skin, and I know it protects me from UV damage. However, I cannot put it anywhere above my lower eyeline. It always runs into my eyes even if I appy it above my eyebrows, so I must use a different non-running sunscreen around eyes and on forehead and temples. It leaves a shiney finish on my oily skin which I like. It would be perfect if it did not get in my eyes. I also must shake it vigorously each time because it separates after not being used for a month. I wish it did not run into my eyes. Maybe powdering would stop it if you like to use face powder. * I haave tried so many facial
Sunscreens shd this is my go to!
Great under makeup and my dry skin feels soft all day. * I wish I had read more comments before buying because they are all correct…this stuff will burn your eyes even when you do not put it anywhere near your eyes. AND hours upon hours after applying. Honestly, I am flabbergasted at why this is but it is. Do not buy. * I love this sunscreen if im careful about not applying too close to my eyes. It sits nicely on the face and doesnt look too oily. I use a light layer of pressed powder in my t zone on top of this to combat the oil and it works pretty well. Just be super careful around the eyes, ive never had such intense burning pain in my eyes as i did when some of this accidentally got on my eyelids"
107,hero cosmetics,force shield superlight sunscreen broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2030344,2591983," * Was using this for about 30 days and noticed it was out of date, went to store to exchange, but all product on shelf was out of date. Contacted hero cosmetics and they basically told me to kick rocks. They were discontinuing it and basically so what you are stuck with SPF that is good for two months. Horrible company.  I will never buy anything from Hero Cosmetics ever again. * I have very sensitive skin with rosacea and have repurchased this SPF time and again. I can use the full amount of SPF recommended by experts and it will still blend smoothly into my skin. (Caveat: This may not blend well for deeper skin tones.) The consistency is a smooth, light cream. The green tint fades into color correction as you blend it. My only quibble is that it is only SPF 30, though that is still fine for most days. My husband loves it as well. * This is the highest zinc oxide percentage ive been able to find in a mineral face sunscreen that don't leave a whitecast for me! And given that I'm allergic to synthetic fragrances, I love that Hero never uses fragrance in their products. 5/5! Will keep purchasing for sure. * This one didn't work well for me. My face is generally red so I was looking for a green tinted product. It just washed me out, my cheeks were basically muted pink, and it smelled funny/metallic. * I have tried using this with my skin care routine and without it and no matter what I do, it ends up pilling on my face every single time. * Everytime I try to use this on my face even if I have no skin care at all on my face it pills so incredibly bad. it looks good for two seconds then just straight up pills. and it's sad because it definitely is a great product and takes away redness and no white cast but it just pills. I use it on my body instead and it doesn't pill as bad but still pills every so often. * Beautiful feeling product and love that it doesn't give a whitecast. Just wish it was spf 50! This is probably one of the best sunscreens I have felt on my face. Not greasy or too thick!"
108,bubble,plus one tinted daily mineral sunscreen broad spectrum spf 40,pimprod2041039,2616745," * So I loved this a t first but one day I went to a store and tried on a sweatshirt and it came off on the sweatshirt!! It doesn't stay on your face super well and it is a good formula but I just wish it absorbed into the skin more instead of feeling like a foundation * This product is horrible. It's greasy, doesn't dry, looks shiny and the tint is nonexistent. I would not recommend this product. It's also not worth the money. * I like the formula, as it dries well and doesn't leave a heavy/sticky feeling. However, I bought this before a trip and all I can see is that ""LOOK HOW ORANGE YOU LOOK"" scene from a certain show in every pic I wore it in. I'm not even that pale! * I use this moisturizer with and without makeup, it gives very light coverage but my skin feels very hydrated after. I also like that it's a mineral spf * Love the way the product has a pump dispenser. The tint is a nice subtle color. Clean ingredients. Would get again. * Okay, so this review may be a little bias if you see it that way, because I'm a supergoop girl all the way. 

I have been using supergoop matte screen tinted mineral spf for about 3/4 years now but decided to try Bubble because it was cheap and I wasn't feeling like spending $40 on supergoop that day. 
I wanted to love it, but I just couldn't use it. First of all, how dare they call it a ""mineral"" spf, It has the texture of cheap drug store mousse foundation. 
Second, some reviews say that the color adjusts on your skin over time, but that was not the case for me, and I'm not pale to begin with. My face was a shade darker than the rest of me for the whole day and it never adjusted. 
Third, the quality is just not there. I felt greasy with it on, and it was very tacky/sticky the whole time i had it on. 
I will definitely be sticking with Supergoop from now on. * I didn't like this product but I'm trying to use it so my money isnt wasted. The smell is awful. Smells like old makeup. Then the way it sits on my skin is uncomfortable and greasy. It's also kind of hard to spread it evenly across the face with your fingers at first because of the consistency."
109,kopari beauty,sun shield on-the-glow sheer stick sunscreen spf 40,pimprod2043794,2618936," * The smell of this sunscreen is nice, but it is super greasy.  I had to reapply several times in a six hour day outside.  My face still got sunburned on my cheeks and nose.  I also woke up the following day with a rash on my neck, cheeks, and forehead.  It was quite sensitive, and it burned.  I'm not a fan of this product. * Its okay. Doesnt provide enough protection. I still burned slightly but not too bad. Followed the directions. Wouldnt recommend for your entire body. Its good for small sections if your just running errands. * I have very sensitive skin, this product works very well, product didn't cause my face to break out or burn when applied. * I bought this as I had a trip and didn't want to pack a drippy lotion in my carry-on. I love it, I apply it over my moisturizer to my face and neck only and it hasn't caused any breakouts. Yes it has glitter , but as someone who isn't a big make-up wearer this isn't a big deal to me. If glitter bothers you it isn't for you. I haven't used it on my body as there are cheaper options for that. * Well the package is deceiving before you buy bc the yellow label hides all of the large flecks of glitter pieces * I liked this because the application was smooth and clear and moisturizing. Although I couldn't stand the strong scent and the glitters were too big for my liking. I can't rate the sun protection though * This has a great lightweight and silky feel when applied and to top it off the glittery finish looks beautiful!!"
110,coola,classic body organic sunscreen lotion spf 50 fragrance free,pimprod2030631,2591975," * It was perfect for laying out but the moment you enter the water it becomes a super super slimy . 
Have used it twice and will be taking it back. * Love the spray sunscreen, easy to use and works really well appreciate the no fragrance * Second ingredient is Homosalate, which is a toxin that is harmful for reefs. * I've been testing the COOLA Hydrating Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 (Fragrance-Free), and it has quickly become a staple in my routine! The texture is lightweight, fast-absorbing, and non-greasy, leaving no white cast, which makes it perfect for all skin tones. It layers beautifully under makeup and provides broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection without feeling heavy.I also love that it contains 70%+ organic ingredients, making it a more eco-conscious choice. Plus, it's reef-safe, cruelty-free, and free from oxybenzone and octinoxate. The 80-minute water resistance is ideal for outdoor activities, ensuring long-lasting sun protection. If you're looking for a clean, effective, and skin-friendly sunscreen, this one is a must-try!Product was received as part of an educational promotion. * This is a good sunscreen. My one complaint is that the cap does not seal the product properly. There is no click mechanism to make sure the cap is sealed. The SPF lotion is not travel friendly as said cap is loose and will not stay on the product if it's in your bag, especially if you are going to multiple places throughout the day. * Possibly my favorite body sunscreen ever. It blends in so well without feeling sticky or gross. Blends in completely clear. And NO SMELL. this is my new go to daily body sunscreen, im so happy i found it. * I had high hopes. But it left a weird film on my skin and rub off in clumps. Even after re-applying several times I still got severely sunburnt."
111,coola,classic face sunscreen mist spf 50,pimprod2030632,2591973," * Light mist and smells great * Love the formulation and light fine mist spray. Didn't make my skin feel greasy. Such an easy way to reapply sunscreen to my face, chest and shoulders. * I bought this with high hopes. Unfortunatly, both times i used it i ended up red,itchy, and swillen. The first tkme I used it was a month ago and the second jusg yesterday. I had to give mh skin at least 2 weeks to recover. Im verg disappointed in the sunscreen. * ive lost probably more than half of the bottle from it leaking sitting upright on a table. * I had high hopes for this product, unfortunately it fell short. When i close my eyes, cover them, and sprayed this, my eyes were immediately burning. This product burned my eyes SO badly I could feel a sting all day long. It was extremely painful. 0/10. * Brought this product on vacation and used it as a sunscreen on top of makeup. My makeup stayed on and it did protect me from sunburn. * I was really interested in the ease of use of the sunscreen however I wouldn't recommend it nor would I use it again. Made my eyes and cheeks swollen, red, and itchy. Took a few days to go away. Also the spray isn't a light mist, it's pretty heavy."
112,murad,multi-vitamin clear coat spf 50,pimprod2044297,2622108," * I have really sensitive skin and when it comes to sunscreen i always have the hardest time. I tried this multiple times and still ended the day with new break outs. * I love how this sunscreen feels under makeup, without makeup, not so much. It works great as a primer for me, but on days I don't wear makeup, it feels greasy on my skin. Regardless, I still like it quite a lot. * LOVE IT * The 'clear coat' went on smoothly but required a fair amount of rubbing to get it absorbed into my face. 
I cannot really speak to the sun protection offered by this product as I spend my days inside at a desk. The few times I went out into the sun after using it, my face had a bit of a burning sensation for a few minutes but I did not get sunburnt/tanned. * I was recommended this since the formula seemed relatively clean and it left no white cast. BUT its SO GREASY. 

I have dry skin and this sits in my face for so long so I have to wait quite a bit to add make up. On busy mornings, I basically have to use a different sunscreen so my makeup can sit well in my skin. * Best sunscreen ever especially since I always wear a full face of makeup almost everyday. I love the clear formula and how easy it is to apply with absolutely no white cast. It really nice as a primer also. Gifted by Murad * This is a clear sunscreen and very easy to apply. It has a scent but its not overbearring. The only thing is it leaves my skin so oily and slippery. I have combonation skin and this takes about an hour to set and feel ""dry""."

It's the size of a mini. I wish the amount of product was states in the description. Its 15g. Im a small woman and the entire product fits in my palm. But its easy to apply and my kids love the texture. Makes it really easy to reapply af school. * This face stick is so much easier to apply on the kids than a lotion or spray. It smells really good and a little goes along way. Very easy to carry with you to reapply when needed. * This face stick is so much easier to apply on the kids than a lotion or spray.

She has sensitive skin when it comes to fragrances and had no reaction to this thankfully. Application is so easy she can do it herself."
114,supergoop!,every. single. face. watery lotion spf 50,pimprod2032491,2595519," * I pove this sunscreen. I've bought several milly aunscreens tbis year ans i keep turning back to this one. It's nice and light ans aupwr easy to easy. It doesnt leave a weight cast (on my fair akin). I alao love thays it's SPF 50 * It is definitely a lightweight product, leaves an amazing glow. I have more dry skin so for me i personally love how it adds that dewy finish, so just saying in case you don't. * I really wanted to love this because Im a big fan of their other products but it's just ok at best. The only real pro is that it didn't have any white cast, but I have light skin so thats not saying much. It also has a very strong, chemical ""sunscreen"" smell which I do not like. However, I'd be willing to look past that for an otherwise great sunscreen, but this just isn't that good. 

The texture is pretty thin and watery, but when you actually apply it, the finish is super greasy and shiny. It's beyond dewy or glowy. The first time my sister saw me wearing this she asked why my face was so shiny! So it's really noticeable, even if you let it sink in. 

I didn't try it under makeup so can't comment on that. * It felt good at first, it has a nice texture. But, it started to leave red marks on my face, so its definitely not for sensitive skin. * this sunscreen sinks in well and is watery as described. the reason I gave it 3 stars is because it got in my eye and it was miserable. * This sunscreen definitely burns the eyes. It is not that watery so it doesnt sink into the skin much. It just sits in top and makes you so greasy. * This product is lightweight and gives a nice moisture. No white residue as other sunscreens have. So far I enjoy it!!!"
115,supergoop!,mini glow oil spf 50 dry body oil sunscreen,pimprod2042889,2617633," * I was really psyched to try this as normal sunscreen tends to dry out my skin and I thought the oil would keep my skin hydrated while providing sun protection. It was greasy and smothering. It felt like my skin couldn't breathe or sweat or regulate its temperature because the oil was so thick. It felt almost as if I had longsleeves on, that is how hot and miserable it made me. * I used this on day 1 of my beach vacation, i reapplied every 2 hours and got the worst sunburn I've ever had! I used a different subscreen on my face and it didn't burn at all. The rest of my trip was miserable and painful, I couldnt even enjoy the beach. * I got the worst sunburn of my life after using this ""sunscreen"" 
This stuff may be good for casual everyday sun protection, but absolutely not for extended outdoor use. * use alone or under makeup. Lovely glass skin. * I passed this on underneath my cream foundation (I have dry skin), and my foundation looks flawless, and I have not gotten any extra freckles. It is a beautiful sunscreen I will keep buying it. * I used this while in Trinidad, and I was sunburned so badly. Everyhwere I used this oil is where I burned the most. * This does not feel oily or greasy. It leave a nice refreshing feel like you just put oil on after a shower. Doesnt stain clothes from regukar wear. Smells good. Nice protection from the sun."

But I don't like the that is make my face oily and my make-up does not last. * this used to be my favorite moisturizer of all time. it was thick, glowy and completely smoothed the texture of my skin like no other. i restocked in march 2025 after not purchasing since 2024 and the product i received can only be summarized as garbage. it smells different, its a much lighter consistency (which i want to note is a BAD thing in this case) and the glow on this lasts about only 10 minutes before seeping in and my skin goes back to dull. i have super (SUPER) dry skin and this product used to be the only moisturizer that actually worked. i'm sad to say that what they're selling now is not the same moisturizer it used to be. if you're reading this in 2025 hoping you've found your new favorite moisturizer, KEEP LOOKING. THE NEW FORMULA OF THIS IS NOT IT! * I'm new to the Supergoop product line and  I really needed this Superscreen to work for me. And voila! It did! I have sensitive skin, both oily and dry if that makes sense. This product goes on smoothly, blends in vs. typical sunscreens that never seem to soak into the skin. I will say I noticed a pretty strong scent of sunscreen when I first opened it. Now, just a few days later, I don't notice it at all. I love how this makes my skin feel hydrated but not oily.

My face started stinging and itching after the second use and it doesnt go on as smooth. * i loved this product for so long, but didnt realize that it what was breaking me out. i tried a different cleanser, added an exfoliater etc. NOTHING would get rid of the harsh bumps all over my face. not until i researched and found out it had safflower it in which (can) support fungal acne. i have dry, sensitive acneic skin so this may work for others but definitely not for me. very disappointed and wish i found out sooner. not even 3 days after stopping this product, my skin is clearing up."
118,kopari beauty,sun shield body glow gel spf 50,pimprod2030935,2592141," * I love this little SPF body glow. I wish it was a bit more shimmery but it absolutely gets the job done and is super hydrating. This has become a staple in my travel bag! * This is my new favorite SPF! I do wish the shimmer was a little louder. But regardless this silky smooth oil is so nice. I love how it doesn't feel like gross sunscreen. And it doesn't smell like nasty sunscreen either. I put it on before I leave the house because I did put it on at the lake once and it got milky and I feel like it washed off vs soaking in and protecting me. But I didn't get burnt. I still tanned real nice! Highly recommend * I looove Kopari bodycare. Decided to give this a try, it made my skin look so radiant, smooth and hydrated all day. It smells amazing (i hate the smell of traditional sunscreen). I dont burn easy but I do tan easy and too much sun exposure can make my skin feel really uncomfortable and dry, this kept my skin feeling very comfortable during high sun exposure. I've only tried this casually running around in the summer, i see other reviews that say that they got burned on beach days, I'd have to try this on a beach day but as a casual body sunscreen its very nice * I normally don't write reviews, but for this I felt inclined to. I applied layers of this at the beach. I stayed about one hour and did not get in the water. As seen in the attached photo, I burned horribly. Very disappointing and upsetting. * I bought the Kopari Sunscreen to take on vacation to Las Vegas. I am an African American woman and it is important to me that I protect my skin. This product not only had my skin shiny and looking radiant but it smells so good. It held up in 102 F. * I really wanted to like this product but it didnt work for me I got so sun burnt and I reapplied multiple times. it does smell amazing though. * I love this stuff, it smells great, it's effective and pretty. I wish the product manager and engineers of this stuff would put a better cap on the bottle. It pops off at the slightest touch. The cap shouldn't come off in my bag, over and over again."
119,cerave,hydrating mineral sunscreen lotion for face spf 50 for all skin types,pimprod2003660,2540955," * This is unwearable for ANY skin tone. Its grey and looks disgusting on the skin. The more you rub it in it pills up and becomes splotchy. So gross do not buy this. * HORRIBLE white cast and bad chemical smell. * Not a good sunscreen for those with medium to dark skin tones. * The white cast was so bad I could be playing Queen Elizabeth the first. You can see near the corner of my mouth where I missed a spot, and compare to my chest how much a cast this has. Feels waxy and will not blend. * HORRIBLE WHITE CAST DO NOT BUY. WILL MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A SILVERBACK GORILLA. * I wore this to a water park. I let it sit for about 30minutes and once my face got wet you could see white splotches all lver my fave and legs. Its like the color added to the suncreen just melted off. * Take a pass on this one. Looks white and gave my daughter and me a rash. Mine lasted for well over a week and was incredibly itchy and inflamed. Nope."
120,shiseido,urban environment oil-free sunscreen broad-spectrum spf 42,pimprod2030941,2592485," * An Ulta employee recommended me this product while I was shopping for my foundation. I was skeptical because I previously didnt like a shiseido product in the past. However, it felt and looked really nice on my skin in the store ao I picked it up. I have been looking for a product that helps with my oily skin. This definitely dies. It protects and does not add shine to ny face. It is a very light tint where i feel great using alone at work with a little blush. I have noticed my skin being less oily and it does not create build up pilling with my makeup. Yes the product is pricey but its wirking for me. It doesn't sting my eyes either! Oily girl approved. * Super hydrating and doesnt stink! * Used under my foundation. My eyes were tearing up all morning after application. Then the sunscreen got into my eyes and no amount of rinsing helped the burning. My eyes were red and puffy all day. It took hours to feel normal again. It was the only step in my routine that I changed that day. * Shisedo changed this formula a couple of years ago and this is one time where the new product is as good or better than the previous. It truly is skin care but also acts as a makeup primer. It's great under makeup or on its own. It's not greasy at all and great for combo or oily skin. * Unfortunately it is not for me. I like the idea and feeling of the glow it has but the white cast is awful. I didn't notice the first few times because I wore it under makeup but put it on for an outdoor walk and when I looked in the mirror it looked like I stuck my face in baby powder. For reference I have a medium deep complexion. It may work for other skin tones but if you are darker then run. * Love the feeling of this, its like your wearing nothing but it does leave a whote cast on my skin. I have medium skin tone * I tried this for a while and its okay. I dont like that it gives me a gray cast and i dont like the texture on my skin. I have oily skin so i end with more oily of shiny parts on my face."

Love the better ingredients. * Bought this to replace the neutrogena mist that got discontinued to protect my tattoos, ended up with a skin rash on both tattooed/not tattooed arms!! Possibly because of the vitamin C in the formula mixed with the sun. Im better off with no sunscreen at this point honestly, severely disappointed. I tried to add a photo but the app wont let me lol * I loved this sunscreen until it only lasted me two days on the beach if you're reapplying how you should be. Very disappointing * I love it! * I got the worst allergic reaction from this product. The citrus ingredients, when exposed to the sun, increase the likelihood of an allergic reaction. I had welts all over my face,arms, and chest. * Not greasy!! Smells great, gives skin a nice glow! Love that it's vegan! Friends love it as well! * I was hopeful for this body sunscreen because I really like Supergoop; however, I found the body mist to be VERY greasy. If protected well against the sun when I was in Grenada, but it was so greasy on my skin."

I was looking for a sunscreen that protected and left no white cast and this does that and more. There is no white cast and it's a moisturizer and a primer, plus it feels light on skin * I really wanted to love it because the founder is South Asian and it is meant to be for our skin. Unfortunately it left a white cast, peeled on my skin, and really made me eyes burn. I dont normally have sensitive skin so this was uncommon for me. Really disappointed, especially aboit the whote cast * I like this sunscreen but only if I plan to wear makeup during the day. I dont usually wear makeup daily, but when I'm on trips or going out during the day and want to look nice Ill wear a little bit of makeup (concealer, powder, bronzer, blush). This stuff works GREAT as a sunscreen + primer as my makeup sticks to it so well. It also does not leave any white cast, but make sure to rub in well as it dries fast on the skin and can sometimes leave streaks. I dont like to use it daily as it does not combine well with my topical acne medications (makes my face feel VERY sticky - which is nice when using makeup, but not nice without makeup). Also, I feel as thought it is pretty drying on my skin due to the mattifying effect and I'm a very oily gal. Using daily tends to slighty irritate my skin and cause dry patches. That being said, if youre a sweaty and oily faced person like me, this stuff is a holy grail to use under makeup - but if you also have sensitive skin, I dont recommend using daily. * This sunscreen/moisturizer/primer is fantastic in my opinion. My skin is very sensitive and responds best to mineral sunscreens. I also have a light skin tone but I am of eastern european and arab descent and my skin does have an olive undertoneand. A lot of mineral sunscreens will leave a slight white cast on me. This does not! I like that it feels very light and is not shiny or ultra matte after it dries down. I see that some people complain about an odd ""smell"" with this product and I do notice a slight smell BUT I don't notice it being overpowering and it seems to disappear after several seconds. I absolutely adore this stuff and it works perfectly for me. I will definitely buy this sunscreen again. * I received this as a sample, an loved it. I ususlly mix it with my bb cream and it adds nice moisture to my dry skin. * This sunscreen left a pretty significant white cast. I have around medium-tan olive skin (Armani Luminous Silk foundation shade 7.8), so there are many deeper skin tones than what I have. I wasn't even applying the recommended amount and still got a white cast. This was particularly disappointing from a brand and product that claims to be inclusive. * This goes on so smooth and works great under my tinted moisturizer. No white cast. No eraser-like shavings when applying another product over it. Mineral sunscreen is better for you."

Hydrating, smells divine, and doesn't irritate my skin in the slightest. Also, I have to give kudos to their graphic design/marketing team because the deliciously retro packaging is what led me to purchasing it in the first place. * I love the way this sunscreen makes my skin look and feel. It dries down to a satin powdery finish that feels great on skin, and leaves it looking moisturized. It has a subtle warm sent, that doesnt bother me even though I don't typically like fragrance. The only issue is that it pills over the skincare I use on my face. So it isn't as universal in its application as I would like. It lays fine over body lotion though. So I'll still use it. * Pills like crazy! I only applied it once and it pilled everywhere. * This behaves just like every other sunscreen you could buy, and has the same problems. Greasy, leaves a weird feeling on the skin and pills like crazy. * I wish i had read the reviews of this product before purchasing it. It pills evey single time it is applied and does not work as an spf. The only positive is that it smells nice. I would not recommend purchasing this product. * I've been looking for a body sunscreen that I could wear all day and not feel sticky or look ghastly. This is perfect. It doesn't leave a white cast and it feels like putting on a body lotion. It smells good, still like sunscreen, but isn't too much."

126,blue lizard australian sunscreen,sensitive mineral sunscreen stick spf 50+,pimprod2043670,2621974," * I am pleased with this stick. With the UV getting high and having to work several hours in the sun, this stick meets my expectations. I've gotten sweaty, dirty, and wet and it holds its ground (reapplying later of course) and never gotten burnt on my face. This is even when areas like my shoulders where chemical sunscreen is applied get toasty. 

Now, it WILL leave a white cast if you do not rub it in. For my purposes, which is to protect my skin against the sun when I am getting sweaty and gross, this doesnt bother me. Yet for the makeup folks, i would not recommend this product to reapply over makeup or to use for that flawless natural look. * I have a newly healed tattoo on my forearm and I read that a mineral sunscreen can help keep it looking new.  This one goes on very easily because of its stick format and has a slight white cast after blending.  Granted, I am extremely pale, but I can see the cast on top of my black and grey tattoo.  The stick is small enough to fit in a purse or pocket.  No offensive odor. * Its solid; hes you need to blend it into the skin but once done, it doesnt have the greasy feel, it blends into the skin and it works fine under makeup (used undereye concealer over top a double application and it stayed in place- no pilling). Ill continue to use and reccomend if anyone i know is looking for a solid face stick * I took a chance on this because I couldn't find Coola's stick sunscreen. Reviews all looked good. Wow. Just WOW. It goes on thick and white. Seriously, if you're going to a costume party and don't have white face paint, this is the perfect dupe. My daughter has incredibly fair skin and this was so white it wouldn't even blend in to look less ridiculous. Remember how lifeguards would put zinc oxide on their noses? This is that level of coverage and appearance. 

On a positive note, I then purchase Sun Bum 50spf for kids. It's clear, smells amazing and works great too. * Brought this hoping it would work as well as the supergoop stick but does not. Definitely leaves a white cast in person and pictures. Would not recommended. * Definetly needs to be rubbed in after applying. But other then that it works great!"

It keeps me protected from sunburn. * I have never had a sunscreen both not work at all and also make me break out so bad. I got acne everywhere that I've never had acne before- and not just acne but cystic acne. Never has a sunscreen done that to me so def won't be risking this brand again. yikes. * I love the way Sun Bum lets me tan without burning but the smell of it is just awful. All SPF sprays smell bad to me but this is the worst. Is it to much to ask for a nice smell in a spray can? * Perfect for vacation and is TSA Aprroved! I definitely recommend this! * Im a redhead that burns easily and lives in the south.  I love sunbum over other brands for its clean formula, smell and coverage.  Ive never had a sun burn while using this product properly.   Shake can well before use and you are good to go! 
I've never had it cause break outs which I am prone to.  It washes off with soap and water in the shower.  I use the sun bum face sunscreen vs this on my face since the face one is a lighter mist thats not greasy at all."

I've been trying a lot of different sunscreens and this is now my favorite body sunscreen that I'll actually want to wear every day. * The formula appears to be a liquid or water based gel, which makes it easy to apply and cover a lot of surface area that is great for sun protection and applying on the body. It has a light sea salt scent reminiscent of summer, beach and playing in the sun. * Love this sunscreen. It's very lightweight and doesn't feel sticky or greasy. I don't think it has much of a scent, which I like because I don't always want to smell fruity or tropical. * This is the best sunscreen I have ever used no grease no stain feels like a light lotion * This is an excellent sunscreen, it goes on smoothly and with zero white cast. I love the scent, but it can be a bit powerful- especially if you decide to put it on your face. It can be a bit greasy feeling too, but it dissipates over time and really sinks in after about 30 minutes. * Great sunscreen especially for the summer. Its lightweight. Love the gel consistency. It's not tacky or sticky feeling and dries fairly quickly - sinks into the skin nicely. No white cast on my tan skin. It * This sunscreen is good, REALLY good! It's a gel-cream formula that melts in invisibly, saving my poor clothes from ANY stains! It is weightless, non-greasy, smooths on great, and I actually really like the very subtle sea salt scent.

131,cetaphil,daily oil free facial moisturizer spf 35,pimprod2028657,2586964," * I tried this product because I was looking for a good moisturizer/sunscreen combo for the face. Overall the product was great. It did not leave a white hue to my light skin-tone face or to my tan skin-tone friend's face like other sunscreens do. I was out in the sun a lot and my face remained sunburn-free. My only complaint is the pump that dispenses the product. The first time I bought this, the pump simply would not work and I had to unscrew the cap and squeeze out the product. I bought the product another time and occasionally had similar issues with the pump. * This would probably work for someone with normal skin but definitely not oily / combo skin. It suffocates my pores and instantly causes me to start sweating. It doesn't wear well under makeup up, at least for me, due to the sweating. * Needs a better bottle * This is my favorite moisturizer. It makes my skin feel soft and nourished without feeling like theres a layer on top of my skin, and it does not feel greasy at all. Plumps skin too. * As soon as i put it on i start sweating it all off immediately. My skin cant breathe because its very thick. Maybe better for those with tighter pores * It good but first of all, it is only 35 spf. Do not get anything thats not over 50 spf. * This is my favorite moisturizer. I use it after washing my face and before putting on my makeup. 
I do not like the bottle it comes in. Theres so much wasted lotion at the bottom thats hard to get to unless I cut upen the bottle— and its a think bottle, which is difficult and dangerous to cut… 
I hope someday this lotion will come in a better sqeeze tube bottle similar to the cereve 50spf facial moisturizer squeeze tube/pump container."

To my surprise, there was ZERO white cast, and the lotion is completely white so it went into my skin nicely and left it pretty soft. I would recommend! * I love it. I put it on everyday. It doesn't make my face look oily even if I apply makeup on top. It's a great product that last for hours. I highly recommend this product. I received this product complimentary from Supergoop. * My skin is super itchy now. * Leaves a white cast. I will use the rest of it since it wasnt cheap but if you have medium to dark skin this might not be the sunscreen for you * My daughter love the super goop SPF 30 lotion it doesn't give a white residue. The whole family use it to. * I occasionally use it as a base for my make up and usually the first thing in the morning. If you don't set it with powder, it can get kind of greasy but otherwise it doesn't clog pores or make me break out."

Put it in a box please! * so i haven't seen anybody mention this, but it literally smells like Head & Shoulders which is a dandruff shampoo in the U.S. Like, literally identical. i used this on my face so the scent is much stronger but it's definitely not overpowering. * I only use this product with powder on top otherwise it gets oily especially with my skin type * I used to use another Neutrogena sheer sunscreen.  It was sheer on the face and body but it left white smears over leather car interiors and dark clothing.  This one does not.  I was hesitant to try the orange looking sunscreen, but it is invisible when applied. My only complaint is that it is too hard to find in stores.  A local grocery only has this in spray-on form which is much too messy to use anywhere but at the beach.  I use sunscreen every day.. * I used this for a few weeks and didn't realize it was getting more uncomfortable, i thought maybe I'd over exfoliated or it was my makeup or something. But one day I applied it and my body rejected it intensely and I needed to go to urgent care with my face in so much pain and red blotches. Patch test but also just be wary if it starts tingling * I was hoping to use this on the face but it's very oily and has a strong smell. Does dry down nicely. It will be good for neck, chest, and hands * Really good sunscreen, as someone that has tried other sunscreens, this is the only one with good consistency and doesn't leave that horrible whitecast!!"
134,coola,travel size piÃ±a colada classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 30,pimprod2012271,2561104," * I went to the beach and I applied this after getting wet and every hour and a half. I am so sunburnt. I look like I went out in the sun without any spf. This product is terrible and did nothing for me. * I like non aerosol spray sunscreen vs. lotions so I was excited to try this. I don't really like the scent or the sticky texture. * Expected SPF 30 protection. This performed like an 8. After 30-minutes, I didn't burn but got white spots. This also smelled like alcohol and had a sticky texture. A gummy residue was left behind after showering. Not for me. * As a cosmetologist and barber, I've seen my fair share of sunscreens, but COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 is a game-changer!  It's like a tropical vacation in a bottle! The piña colada fragrance is so refreshing and fun, it makes applying sunscreen feel like a treat rather than a chore. Plus, it doesn't have that overpowering chemical smell like some other sunscreens. The spray bottle makes it super easy to apply evenly all over your body, even those hard-to-reach spots. No more awkward contortions trying to reach your back! And because it's organic, I feel good knowing I'm not slathering myself in a bunch of nasty chemicals. The protection. SPF 30 is perfect for everyday wear, whether you're running errands or lounging by the pool. Overall, COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 is a must-have. It smells amazing, applies like a dream, and provides top-notch sun protection. Trust me, once you try it, you'll never want to use another sunscreen again! This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I am loving COOLA right now. This SPF is perfect for this dreadful Texas humidity and heat. It's very lightweight, non-greasy, and has a pleasant scent. Reapplying is a breeze since the product doesn't build up on the skin or cause a film. It's very breathable and works well with general skin sensitivities. The size is quite large for travel, but still small enough to throw in your beach bag and still have space for other necessities. It has a click-locking spray top so it doesn't accidentally spray in your bag. I will say that if your skin is very dry, you may want to go for a cream SPF because this does not provide much moisture. This is definitely made for hot, sunny summers. I love it and I know for sure I am buying a full-sized bottle to keep on hand.

***This review was collected as part of a promotion.*** * As a professional in the beauty industry, I've learned firsthand the  importance of sun protection, making COOLA's  spray an indispensable asset. In an industry where skincare is very important, COOLA stands out with its dedication to not only protecting against harmful UV rays but also enhancing the overall experience of sun care.

As someone deeply invested in skin health, I love COOLA's commitment to providing a product that protects and cares for my skin.

The scent of Piña Colada fragrance is delicious. Gone are the days of sunscreen smelling like, well, sunscreen. Instead, COOLA's tropical scent transports me to my last vacation. It's a big change from the clinical smell of traditional sunscreens, making the application process a sensory experience.

I did not have any issue in my delicate skin but I always recommend  a patch test.

In my personal opinion, COOLA's in spray isn't just a sun protection product; it's an  evolution of skincare. With its comprehensive protection, anti-aging benefits, and irresistible Piña Colada scent, COOLA has redefined what it means to stay safe in the sun. So, whether I am lounging by the pool or hitting the beach, I make COOLA my go-to companion for summer adventures.

Its tropical scent evokes visions of sunny beaches and relaxation, enhancing the application process with a touch of indulgence. The organic formula boasts SPF 30, providing reliable protection against both UVA and UVB rays, crucial for preventing sunburn and long-term skin damage. What sets this sunscreen apart is its lightweight texture, which absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. This feature is particularly appealing for those who dislike the heavy feeling often associated with sunscreen application. The spray mechanism ensures effortless and even coverage, making it convenient for reapplication throughout the day, especially during outdoor activities. Furthermore, the use of organic ingredients adds to its appeal for those who prioritize natural  products. 

 In conclusion, the COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a luxurious and effective sun protection solution for those who appreciate both quality and indulgence in their routine."
135,black girl sunscreen,kids moisturizing broad spectrum spf 50,pimprod2038237,2609781," * I wear sunscreen on my face everyday. I initially bought this for a trip to Mexico to use on both my face and body so I did not have to pack to types of sunscreen. In addition it is a 3 ounce bottle so it met TSA requirements for carry on. This has become my favorite daily sunscreen. I should note I have Normal to dry skin. * No white cast, great for sensitive skin, and affordable. I reapply 2-3x a day on my face, chest and neck and it doesn't feel greasy. No fragrance. 

I don't reapply under my eyes (just do once in the morning) because it makes them tear up, but mine are very sensitive. 

So thankful for this sunscreen! * I got a chemical burn on my face an was desperately lookimg for a sunscreen that had ingredients gentle enough to not increase the constant burning feeling. I dead through sooo many sunscreens and this was an AMAZING choice. And even after im all healed, its still my favorite because it doesn't give me that sticky feeling other sunscreens do. * This one isnt greasy which I love and I dont feel any burning/itchy sensation after applying it. * I use this everyday. It feels amazing on my skin. It doesn't burn for me but can sting if it gets into my eyes (normal). It doesn't have to weighty feel that a lot of other mineral sunscreens do but still feels like a nice moosturizer. And ++++ that it works great under makeup. I tried so many sunscreens before and this one stands above all else. * I apply this sunscreen daily. I have been using this for a couple of years now. I've strayed a couple of times, but I always come back to this. I have sensitive skin and eyes, and this is the only one I have found that doesn't irritate my skin, or sting my eyes. (I slather this all over my face, including my eyelids) * I love my BGS Kid's because it feels amazing and moisturizing on my face! I was recommended this by a friend, and it leaves no white cast. I don't like gel-consistency sunscreens, so I was stoked to find a classic lotion consistency, this one works great for me!"
136,shiseido,urban environment vita-clear sunscreen spf 42,pimprod2039504,2612331," * Goes on greasy but feels nice once absorbed. Stings like crazy if ut gets in your eyes. Rinsed my eyes and used eye drops and the stinging still lingered. Terrible for the price. * Excellent choice for those with sensitive skin. Infused with vitamin C, it offers effective sun protection without causing breakouts. The lotion leaves a slightly shiny finish but doesn't make the skin oily, making it a great base for foundation. Highly recommended for its lightweight feel and skin-friendly formulation. * Goes in clear which is great fir those ""no makenup days"" 
Very hydrating and gives my skin a nice glow. I wear in the summer time and my face always feels protected. 
Id tou are jot into the glowy/dewey look, id recommend a diffrent product! * I really like this sunscreen! It absorbs very quickly, lightweight, and help controls my oil production throughout the day. I still have to blot my face in the afternoon, but it helps. I also like to use a water base moisturizer underneath :) 
PLEASE NOTE* a little goes A LONG WAY! 
Your face will be a grease pit if you put too much on, learned the hard way. * I dont get why some people love the ""dewey"" effect because at least on me, when I put this sunscreen on, it felt like I just spent the day frying stuff in the kitchen and all sweaty, right after my shower! It went straight to the trash can. * This sunscreen reminded me of a drugstore formula, not something I'd expect from Shiseido. It has an oily, sticky texture - not like your typical Shiseido sunscreen or a clear sunscreen like Supergoop. It's greasy, doesn't absorb well, and it stings the eyes terribly like a poorly-formulated budget buy. I really dislike it and will be returning it."
137,tula,mineral magic oil- free mineral sunscreen fluid broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2025972,2584410," * I use under any makeup or alone. Doesnt make my face break out and provides SPF * I love this!  it's a mineral sunscreen for face that truly goes on clear.  It has a beige tint til applied.  It adds a natural glow and makes skin look beautiful.   Perfect for mature skin.The expiration date (on the box and tube) isn't always great - 5 months.  The tube leaks into the cap, so I store mine with the tip upward. 
it's spf30, so it's efficacy is 2 hours - so reapply.   I highly recommend this for a mineral sunscreen. * It's lightweight and easy to wear but I dont feel like it protects me enough from the sun. I feel like I need to apply so much for it to work. Plus it's very small for the price. * The first bottle i bought was perfect. The sunscreen is incredible and makes you look so glowy. Doesnt break me out. I didnt have an issue with the bottle leaking. I just bought a second bottle and it is just not travel friendly at all. Half of it spilled in my toiletry bag. Id love for the packaging to get fixed so its not leaky but the product itself is top notch. Only sunscreen id ever use on my face * I do like this. It has a slight tint that when applied it's hardly noticeable but sunscreen seems a little drying but not as much as some other tinted sunscreens that I""ve tried. Would buy this again. * I find this sunscreen perfect for sitting under makeup or wearing it alone. * This sunscreen has Butyloctyl Salicylate, a cousin to octisalate, and a chemical UV absorber. That's how they can get a higher SPF with such a low concentration of Zinc or TO. So it isn't purely mineral. I like it and use it, but I wish they wouldn't market it as 100% mineral when it has unregulated chemical UV absorbers in it."
138,blue lizard australian sunscreen,sheer mineral sunscreen lotion for face spf 50+,pimprod2043669,2621977," * Although it's a sheer mineral sunscreen, I found that it's still difficult to completely rub into the skin and leaves a white cast (like most mineral sunscreens). I really wanted to like this brand as I've also tried their other sunscreens but they're just not for me. * I agree with many other reviewers about the product's comfort on the skin, easy to rub in formula, and ease of washing off compared to other mineral sunscreens. I switched to this from the CeraVe facial moisturizing lotion with SPF for a higher coverage and mineral. After about a month, my entire face was broken out, from my forehead line, temples, cheeks, chin, and jaw, all red under the skin bumps that were super itchy. Even though it's an otherwise clean product, make sure to spot test this a few times before buying! * I really wanted to like this sunscreen, especially because of the protection from blue light. However, this product isn't for me. It takes quite a while to rub in, and a white cast is still inevitable. It also feels greasy after a few hours of wear. I wish Ulta would restock the Jack Black sunscreen I have come to love over the years! * I tried the blue lizzard Sheer Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Face SPF 50+ and I was very impressed. It is very lightweight and goes on sheer. I have very dry skin and most mineral sunscreens leave my skin uncomfortably dry after 2 hours. This is not the case with the blue lizzard sunscreen. I am able to wear it and reaply without my skin feeling uncomfortable. This is a great product for the price. * When applying the proper amount, it does leave a white cast on brown skin. But feels great on skin * I was recommended by a dermalogist to use blue lizard. I have dark brown spots.I have been using this product for over 6 years. I have noticed a difference on my face. * I've heard nothing but good things about this brand and when I ran out of my current face sunscreen, I decided to try this one. I love that it's an SPF50. That's honestly the only positive thing I can say about this sunscreen. It comes out pretty runny, but it's the consistency of Elmer's Glue and I imagine that this is exactly what it would feel like if you tried to rub glue into your face. On top of being difficult to apply, it leaves a horrible white cast. This one was a miss for me."
139,sun bum,daily 50 face gel,pimprod2043277,2619923," * This sunscreen is the only one I have tried so far that sits comfortably on my skin. It doesn't feel oily or sticky, it melts into my skin flawlessly. It's scent is minimal, but still noticeable. The only issue I had was that by the end of the day, if I rubbed my eyes or sweat too much, my eyes would sting a little. I heard that this could be an issue due to it being a chemical sunscreen, but I still wanted to try it out. I love the product other than that one issue, so I cannot continue using it. * this sunscreen was peeling. i would wait ten minutes between my moisturizer and sunscreen and even then when i began application the sunscreen would immediately start to pill up. i had to wipe my hands between sections of my face and wipe off the flaky resedue. it does get you matte, but only for a bit. after one hour my t-zone would be so shiny and oily. this sunscreen is not good and too much of a hassle to keep up with. do nit waste your money on it * This sunscreen is a great texture. Only problem is if it seeps into your eyes, it burns really bad. Do not put this under your eyes or on your eyelids. If it didnt burn then this woild be a awesome sunscreen! * I bought this sunscreen before i realized it has 5 oils including coconut oil which makes me nervous due to the high chance to clog pores. But i decided to still try it and the texture is really nice. I love that it is at least SPF 50, clear and easy to blend yet feels very hydrating and light. I love that it's water resistant most likely from the oils which makes it very smooth. * I have been using this sunscreen for about a week now, and i am loving it! I have extremely oily skin, so it's important to me to find a sunscreen that doesnt feel heavy or greasy. It blends into my skin very easily and wears well under makeup. It hasn't broke my skin out either! A lot of people have commented on the smell of it, but i do not notice any smell while applying it to my face. I will definitely keep using this sunscreen!! * This sunscreen changed my life, im normally sensitive to sunscreen and this one is perfect * I hate dewy sunscreen. Ive tried all big popular brands (supergoop, shisedo, elta md, etc) and this is my got to. I reach for this spf over all the others beacuse it feels light on my skin and has a matte finish. I have acne prone skin and feel/ look gross with that dewy shiny finish. This sun bum fel is simliler to the super goop unseen but feels breathable on my skin. I give it a good shake and have no problem getting the recommended amount on. I see a few reviews say it smells bad- but i dont think it has any scent. I wear this everyday."

141,beekman 1802,milk primer spf 35 3-in-1 daily defense sunscreen & makeup perfecter,pimprod2024957,2577634," * Let me start off by saying that it's not for everyone. 
Depending on whether you want: dewy, mattifying, silicone, etc. 
This is more matte, and depending on the foundation you use, you'll need primer too. But it's 100% worth a try! I'll be re-purchasing! * An Ulta employee so graciously put me on to this product when I came in looking for a primer with SPF coverage and wow, did they deliver! Goes on super smooth and has no issues with clinging to dry patches or pilling (though if you're having issues with pilling, check what products you're layering under this! Jojoba oil/rose hip seed oil have never given me issues). Helps to even out my makeup and leaves no noticeable white cast under medium coverage foundation. This is quite a dewy primer, which may not be suitable for super oily folks, but works great with my combo skin. Took me about 5 months of almost-daily use to fully use all of the product, so I feel like the price is more than fair given that is satisfies the purpose of both a primer and daily SPF. Just make sure to shake it well before use to combine the product and help the pump function better! * I love this stuff, the formula is thin and watery but it leaves the skin silky. It does not pill at all under makeup, and feels super loght weight. * did nothing for me * This profuct is AMAZING!! I absolutely love everything about it. The texture on my face, the scent, the blurring effect. Key is to let it dry at least 3-4 minutes before applying the next skin regimen step. * I'm south east Asian with neutral light to medium skin tone and this left a white cast. My makeup didn't settle well with the primer. don't want to throw it away so I use on the body for extra SPF. * I sooo wanted to love this product but the smell is so horrible. I think I got a bad batch because I haven't heard someone else complain of the smell. The texture and prime this product has is just so incredible though ;("
142,sun bum,mini original spf 45 sunscreen face mist,pimprod2044628,2625244," * I love this refresher spray. Plus, it has SPF. I mean, I don't count on that for the amount of SPF I need, but it's a bonus. If you don't like scent, this isn't for you, but I love it!  It doesn't stay strong, but every time I spray it, someone comments how great it smells. * I LOVE THE SPRAY. but not sure if its my fave daily sunscreen. I like a lotion sunscreen but this is convenient. Smells like all other sunbum products (banana/summer) and i layer diff spf products. * I use spf makeup but this is perfect to carry and apply when im oitside with out ruin my hair or makeup * Love this face SPF mist for a nice cooling effect. Recently went on a beach vacay.  I used this product throught the day. I could pull it out of my bag and quickly get my SPF protection with a clean clear light mist. It was cooling as well which was a great plus in the hot climate.  A light tropical scent that dissipates quickly. So glad i had this. Works great. I would definitely encourage others to purchase if just for the ease of use. I sprayed over makeup too. This is a great performance product. * Smells strongly of fake banana, burned the skin while applying, left me feeling sticky and greasy."
143,supergoop!,play lip balm spf 30,pimprod2043481,2620424," * Can't understand why it puts such an awful taste in your mouth * I live in Florida and have VERY fair skin - the sun is crazy strong here and I want to keep the freckles on my lip lines at bay. So, I spotted this while buying other Supergoop products and thought it was going to be a slam dunk. I've been forcing myself to use it religiously for a week now, and… I just don't hate myself enough to keep doing it anymore! It tastes bitter, which I can deal with by layering something over it - but it's also weirdly *gritty*?! Somehow, it ends up IN your mouth way more than other lip balms do, so you'll be forced to taste this disgusting rainbow far more often than is normal. On top of that, it's pricey for the size.

I'd never buy this again - it's already relegated to the bottom of my beach bag. 

(Pro tip: You can buy a 3-pack of Hawaiian Tropic lip balm for less than the cost of one tube of this stuff. It goes on smoothly, smells / tastes SO MUCH BETTER, and doesn't melt/break down in the heat of a car or beach bag. Plus… did I mention it's a fraction of the cost?!) * I'm not sure why this product leaves a better taste in your mouth. I understand it is a sunscreen lip balm but after putting it on, I could taste a strong bitter taste in my mouth like chemicals and it's lasted for hours. I'm sure I'm not allergic to this product and that's just maybe the sunscreen, but I do believe it should be formulated to where it does not have any chemically taste, if you're only concerned as protection from the sun and might not be bothered by the chemical taste and I do suggest to purchase, but it's a hard no for me. Also not sure why it's labeled as açai. I could not taste it (flavoring) and it did not have a pink hue. * I have never had any allergic reaction for almost 35 years of my life.
I have used old variant without any mint/acai and i loved that one. So trusting the brand, i bought the one with Mint this time.
One application of this Lip Balm (mint) and I end up having horrible allergic reaction.
My lips are burning, swollen, extremely dry, red, itchy. Wish I could add an image.
Hoping it clears soon, its been 3 days now. It pains while eating and even smiling.
Save yourself! * it doesnt taste bad at all, especially being an spf lipbalm. i love it, but the big box for an average sized product is kinda… meh. * It feels great on the lips. It's not sticky. It also smell good. What I hated was that it taste like sunscreen. I understand it's sunscreen balm but I just couldn't  love it. It taste like was eating sunscreen. * I was looking for a lip product with SPF for the summer months and running outside. I love the flavor and texture of this product, and it is very moisturizing. I do with it was slightly thicker so it would stay on a bit longer."
144,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen stick spf 40 invisible sun protection,pimprod2043900,2620575," * don't be fooled by the the good reviews, the ingredients are comedogenic and made my skin freak out. I have a painful cystic pimple from using it and am really upset about it. * Love everything about this sunscreen like all the comments. It glides very nicely and truly is unseen. 

However, it did move the make up a lot on a hot day - I didn't set my concealer and contour which are all cream products, so I cannot speak for powder or after setting spray. 

Next time I probably would blot my face first, and glide only once and not back and forth. * Gifted by supergoop. This is really a great sun screen that is not tacky that would pick up sand or give that greasy feeling. It gets in the wrinkles/hard to reach spots with a fine tip and the other side is wider for large areas like forehead. This is great for putting on yourself or others * Goes over makeup super well if you have a fixing spray (not just a setting spray. A FIXING SPRAY) on top of the makeup… so it's amazing for an outdoor summer or destination wedding/bachelorette/baby shower/wedding shower/event in general. Etc. gifted * . * I bought this product because of the rating thinking it would be a great product but it wasnt at first it felt great on the skin but whenever i tried washing it off it would burn my face sooo bad  then the second time I pit it on my face was soooooo dry and flaky. I totally don't recommend * I really wanted to love this, as i have several other products that i love. However, if your skin is on the dryer side I wouldn't recommend. I even used it on my young son while on vacation in FL and his poor face was also very dry."

Definitely will be a repeat buyer of thus. The only con is the formula is a little runny, but overall a great mineral sunscreen option! * I ended up with Basal cell skin cancer. I asked the dermatologist what brand of non-toxic sunscreen would she recommend that would NOT leave you looking white. This is what she recommended. It worked great! It goes on white but when you rub it in it doesn't leave a white film on your skin at all.  I have tried the other Blue Lizard applications and they all seem to NOT leave my skin white. So far no sunburn and I am happy. * I will use this sunscreen for now on.  Family took trip and no one was burned during our week vacation.  The sheer sunscreen does not leave white film on skin so the kids loved it also. * Keeping in mind that i am fair/light complexion - I love this sunscreen. I have very sensitive eyes so chemical sunscreens are completely out. When it comes to mineral sunscreens many feel dry and cakey on my skin, which also leads to eye irritation because I also have dry skin. This has been a good in between satin finish once it dries down, doesn't emphasize any lines on my face, and doesn't irritate my eyes. I use this as a facial sunscreen daily and it wears well under makeup and doesn't have large white cast on my complexion. * I loveeeee this sunscreen! I did not burn at ALL - spent 8+ hours in the sun in Puerto Rico for multiple days and felt good about getting some sun without damage. Its thick when you squeeze it out but rubs out silky. * Just received today, and really enjoy it upon first impressions. Applied this sunscreen to my face and it was so easy to blend out and didn't feel drying as the day went on. It did look a bit shiny, so I fluffed a bit of translucent powder over my t-zone to take care of the matter. I can't speak for how it performs under makeup, but I have an inkling that it will look beautiful. After trying my fair share of sunscreen over the years, I think this one will be my new go-to. I only ever buy mineral sunscreens, and this one is pretty exceptional. * works very smoothly, didn't have any bad reaction to it and I have sensitive skin. highly recommend!!"
147,bliss,block star mineral daily sunscreen,pimprod2027018,2584854," * This is the first suscreen ive tried since switching from chemical sunscreen and by far I'm satisfied with how great the wuality is. Its a smooth application, non oily/greasy, AND no white cast (I have light/medium tan skin). Id definietly recommend this product if looking for a mineral suscreen that's non-comedogenic, lightly scented. * This mineral sunscreen has blown me away. It goes on so smooth, does not bead up in heat. After applying it, I don't need to use primer. Amazing product!!! * This is one of my favorite summer products. I use it alone as a skin tint - SO easy and the finish is perfect. But it is tinted to suit fair/medium skin so it's dark on me before I have a tan. Please please please make more shades!! * Not good * I feel like this is a good tinted sunscreen for those that have oily skin. It's thick but doesn't feel moisturizing at all. I live in the desert and do a super juicy skincare routine and have oily skin. Because my skin is beyond drenched, when I put this on last, that dewiness still comes through and I feel like my skin doesn't look massively oily as the day goes on. But again, I'm doing a lot of moisturizing steps before hand. If you're dry or doing light skincare, this is gunna make you look parched. It gives no coverage, but I think it tamps down my redness a little bit. I haven't tried this under makeup. The color looks dark out the tube but on me (light tan) it blends well. Darker skin will probably have a white cast. It does transfer so watch out for your clothes. My main con is the smell. It's like a citrus kitchen cleaner that's heavy on the cleaner part. Not pleasant at all. It goes away, but lordy I hold my breath until then. * My favorite sunscreen so far. I have medium - tan skin so I have a hard time finding sunscreens that dont make me look like I have unblended white on my face. This tint is perfect and not overpowering. This is great for people who want a natural look and sun protection. I dont feel greasy or oily either. * This is my everyday sunscreen. It has a slight tint which is perfect for me even with my fair skin. With this, a little spot concealer, blush, brow tint and mascara, im good for the day. I do set with a light setting powder and it wears beautifully. I purchased almost 4 times already and will continue to do so. Great product"

I typically love Dermalogica products, this one was a disappointment. * So orange, I would never be able to blend this to make it look OK. it was comical how fast it went from the white out of the bottle to a very deep orange. * I REALLY wanted to like this due to the price but it was absolutely terrible. It flaked on my skin so bad. The first time I used it I used it on it's own and blended it with my fingers and it left flakey streaks on my face. So the second time I used my skincare first and tried to blend this in with a beauty blender and got the same results. Both times I shook the tube well according to the label and got the same results. Very sad this didn't work for me! * After putting it on for a few days (maybe 3). My skin next to my ears starting to breakout. Now anytime I put it on my skin turned hot and itchy like crazy. I love this brand and has other products from them with no issue. Not sure why my skin doesn't like this. * Non greasy sun protection that works well alone and under makeup. Does blend in with your skin color and slightly blurs skin brown spots and blemishes. * Hey Ulta, Dimethicone is a silicone. This product should not come up with your silicone free search filter."
150,black girl sunscreen,make it glow continuous spray spf30,pimprod2032832,2597427," * This sunscreen makes your skin feel so soft and hydrated, I love the ingredients put into this product and yes, it does. Keep the sun away. * sensitive skin,  prone to break outs with lots of new products.  this sunscreen was great! * It does the work! No skin burning, no irritation, no strong scent. My husband and my son both work outdoors for a good portion of their jobs and they have no complaints! * Im reading a lot of reviews and honestly yall dont know how to use sunscreen. Why are you spraying it directly on your face and over your makeup. If you are using it on your face spray some in your hands and pat it of your face and also do a patch test when trying new products. Everyone skin is different. * The best sunscreen for me. * I bought this just to use to go to the beach, but the next morning my skin looked so good. I started using it daily as part of my morning routine and I get compliments all the time about my skin. I saw someone didn't like that you couldn't spray directly to the face but honestly as an oily skin girl, it really should be rubbed into the skin, otherwise it just sits on top very dewy. I am at work at 7 and normally oily by 1 but since using this, I have a nice glow but significantly less oily than I am bare faced. I also don't wear makeup to work, drink lots of water, and barely get 6 hours sleep. So I promise you it really is the sunscreen because my habits have gotten worst but my face is still improving from being acne prone and very sensitive. They make a version specifically for face I want to try. * Love this product, i spray a little in my hand and rub into my face, neck, chest and arms for an amazing glow. My coworker kept saying this is something extremely beautiful about your skin…had to share my secret lol"

152,hero cosmetics,force shield superbeam sunscreen apricot spf 30,pimprod2036749,2605374," * I keep buying this. Great for my sensitive acne prone skin. Blends beautifully. I have fair skin but the green sunscreen leaves a cast on me. This one is perfect. * Finding the right sunscreen is so hard, especially when you only want mineral formulas. The one I used for several years got discontinued. I tried SO many before finding this one. I don't have acne prone skin so I had kind of overlooked this brand. It's a decent amount of physical blocker but feels super lightweight and not greasy. I love the slight glow from the apricot tint, no white cast at all. All my usual makeup products sit very well on it with no pilling. And most importantly it seems to do it's job well. Make sure you use enough, you can't skimp with sunscreen! * I have tried all types of mineral sunscreen and most are too drying or too oily. Once this sets on the skin it dries down nicely without being overly anything. I will be repurchasing over and over. The tint looks like it would be too orange but when you put it on it disappears pretty good and just blends in. I add a little concealer and light powder on top and I'm good. This is not a substitute if you want a foundation type coverage. If your skin is relatively nice or you are comfortable, just put it on conceal the areas of concern and go about your day. I think it is good for more mature skin than wants a glow. Powdering does dim down the glow too. Love it! * This sunscreen is completely unusable. As soon as this touched my skin it began pilling and peeling. There were huge spaces on my skin that the product refused to stick to, and the parts it did stick to were a pilling mess. Plus the color is way too orange. The packaging is weird too. It has a pump on it which is completely unnecessary for a squeeze bottle and it makes it difficult to get out the proper amount for the 2-finger method. Do not waste your time or money on this sunscreen. * I am a long time fan of the green version of this SPF. Love how you can get every last bit of product from this packaging, plays nice with makeup, never breaks my very sensitive skin out. Great product, figured I should give this one a go! 

…well, first pump and I just knew this was going to turn me into a jaundiced oompa loompa! But I gave it a whirl just in case. If I wasnt Type I on the Fitzpatrick scale I'd be fine but I could see bits of orange sticking in my eyebrows and onto the dry bits of skin. I did look a bit orange, especially with the anount of sunscreen you are meant to apply for full coverage. Lovely glow finish but it made my foundation look like it oxidized, when it's usually perfect. 

I'll stick with the green version :) * I have combo/oily skin and have been trying various moisturizers with SPF. My skin is also acne prone, so anytime I use a chemical sunscreen I break out. Because this is mineral zinc based, I've seen no breakouts or irritation! The formula is light and easy to apply, and the apricot orange-ish tint surprisingly works fine for my light neutral complexion. Downsides are the pearly shimmer aspect, the slightly tacky feeling, and some pilling near the end of day. I much prefer a matte/natural finish, but if you're going for dewy/glowy you'll probably love this. 

I tried the other Force Shield too, and hate the green aspect since I don't have redness, but love the smoother matte texture more than this one. SO my solution is to split the difference- one pump of each and mix before applying lol! I wish Hero would make two new formulas to add to the collection- one basic like the green but with no color, and one with a lighter apricot/neutral tint and no shimmery stickiness. 

Overall: love the price, no breakouts or irritation, light formulas, mineral zinc; wish it wasn't shimmery or dewy. * Its okay, im on the paler side and this has a tint to it, somit makes me look orange-ish. 
Its also really oily feeling on my skin."
153,black girl sunscreen,make it matte sunscreen - spf 45,pimprod2030390,2592310," * While putting on my face it was a little difficult to smear on face because of the ""silcone"" but once I put the product on my eyelids the burn increasingly became worse. It took about 5-10 mins of washing out my eye area to remove the burn. NOT WORTH the $$ * This has been my favorite facial sunscreen primarily because: 

(1) I love that it mattifies my face because I can get a little shiny. It is especially wonderful before makeup application.

(2) I love that there is NO white cast. 

(3) Wearing it regularly has helped my face blemishes fade away. I learned how much sunscreen helps in that process. And how not wearing it can make the marks darker or last longer.

I find that the tube goes a long way. Sometimes, it has separated a bit but I just try to squish it to mix it when that happens. More pros than cons for sure. I love BGS! * This is a great sunscreen- leaves no white cast! I Highly recommend. * Black Girl Sunscreen is the only sunscreen that I use. It doesn't leave a white cast on my face. I like that it has a matte finish. * Love how my skin feels * Even with vigorously shaking this product comes out partially gelled and partially liquid, so I dont trust the SPF stated on the bottle because you cant uniformly mixit. I also put some in a travel container and it completely separated with a firm gel lump surrounded by oily liquid. * It keeps me from looking extra oily, but it doesn't stay matte all day."

Do not end up like me rash all over for days! * This is the only sunscreen I use!!!  If a sunscreen doesn't break me out, I can assure you it most likely will not break you out.  EVERY sunscreen out there that says acme safe breaks me out, even Elta MD!   This one is AMAZING!!!   Supergoop customer for life!!! * I have tried several high end mineral screens, they all leave a white cast, but this one blended properly does not. It does not smell, it is weightless and perfect for use under makeup or on it's own. I go between their mineral face tint and this one, I do not always want or need color. I recommend this line to everyone, and they do NOT test on animals * I've tried all of Goop sunscreen products. I like the way this texture blends into my skin, does not have a strong ordor like Every Single Face or greasy feeling like Unseen. * Got this in the travel size, as it was the tiniest mineral sunscreen I could find. It's fine, but a bit heavy if you use the recommended amount (takes a while to soak into my normal-to-dehydrated skin after skincare) and on a humid day it feels quite cloying. But my big issue is that it smells like rancid peanut butter. Why??? I can't see an ingredient that would cause that smell, but based on other reviews it's normal for the product. There's better out there, unfortunately those brands don't make minis so I'll prepare to smell like peanuts when I travel lol. * This is by far the best sunscreen gor acne probe skin.  Every sunscreen on the market that says ""acne safe"" or ""non comedigenic"" still break me out.  I have VERY sensitive skin and eyes, and this bever burns or stings.  It does what it says it does.  It also does not pill under makeup.  If yoy're a dark skintone, you will HAVE to wear fou dation over this, as it does leave the normal mineral sinscreen white cast. * Its moisturizing and leaves a slight white cast for my POC folks and I havent gotten sunburnt while on it. Doesnt feel too heavy but you'll notice it on your face. No chemically smell and doesn't make my eyes sensitive. Its good under makeup. Haven't tried it in water. Great for folks with combo, dry, or normal skin types. It does what it says it does, but nothing magnanimous especially considering the price and quantity. Other sunscreens at lower price points get the job done the same, if not better. For acne prone skin, Good Molecules and Hero have good sunscreens as well. Otherwise, its worth a try if you want a physical sunscreen."

I put it on my arms, chest and neck before I went swimming each day for an entire week. love how the sunscreen is so easy to apply. The spray nozzle sprays the perfect amount and the bottle itself is easy to take with you anywhere. I don't have to worry about the white streaks of not blending well. It makes it also easy to reapply sunscreen during the day, especially if you're playimg in the water. The lightweight formula is non greasy and works efficiently! A summer must have! * Smells great & lightweight, non-sticky. I applied this  for two days only on my face. The third day I applied to neck, chest , shoulder , arms but unfortunately that evening I developed a heat rash. I obviously have allergy to an ingredient in this specific item and not everyone will have same reaction. I would def do patch test first if concerned. Otherwise I would have continued with product If I didn't have allergy. * I bought this to keep on my car for reapplication throughout the day. It is a fine mist that sprays evenly and layers well over makeup. Exactly what I was looking for!"

This goes on so white (like all mineral versions), but it never fully seems to soak in. You're left with a cast on your skin, and worst of all you'll burn. * The whitecast is crazy. I tried rubbing it in for a long time. I mixed it with a tint, that didnt help either. Here is my leg/foot after a few hours of wear, and I can see where my sandals rubbed it off, but that just shows how crazy the white cast is. Im naturally med-tan skin. * Leaves my face feeling so greasy and doesnt absorb into skin. I'm left with my face looking paler than the rest of my body. * Its so thick that it would not absorb no matter how hard I rubbed it in and it made my legs loom straight up WHITE. I felt like I rubbed toothpaste all over myself. * My dermatologist recommended this mineral sunscreen. I was previously on la roche posay spf face moisturizer but since it wasnt mineral, my doc wanted me to switch. Instant horrible white cast which was quite comical. It smells like rubber tires. I broke out in a rash by day 2, my skin feels like reptile skin. Took a break on day 3 but on day 4 it burned after i applied it. It pills and was blotchy on my skin. Im officially done with this spf. * Has a white cast that just doesnt rub in. Not worth the hassle * Does not absorb into my skin. Makes my face look very greasy"

PROTECTS, DOES NOT LEAVE WHITE RESIDUE BECAUSE IT BLENDS INTO YOUR SKIN. WE LOVE LA ROCHE-POSAY PRODUCTS CAUSE THEY WORK AND YOU DON'T BREAK OUT. LEAVES YOUR SKIN SMOOTH. * This applies well and feels like nothing on the skin. Would definitely repurchase. * The only sunscreen my sunscreen-averse husband will use. He finds it convenient to spray (his face, bald head, body, everywhere), it absorbs quickly when rubbed in, and it is the most effective one at preventing burns of the many we have tried. * Ive given this sunscreen many chances and everytime it gets into my eyes. It burns for a while too. As soon as you use a towel/rag to soothe your eyes a minute later they'll start burning again. This can happen for hours. Wanted to love this because it doesn't leave a white cast if you rub it in enough, but the eye burning isn't worth that. * i bought this in store at the beginning of summer after an employee recommended it to me. i'm a natural redhead, so im pretty pasty and prone to skin cancer/burning easy. i was hesitant because it was super pricy - but a little goes a long way!!! i work outside in the sun all day and have every day for the summer, and i havent burnt ONCE since buying and actively using this. i still have over half the bottle after 2/3 months. it is so worth the money. * I really wanted to like this BUT I've used it a few times and for some reason, after about an hour, even though I'm not sweating, this sunscreen starts to get in my eyes and even my mouth! Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation. It has Benzophenone in it, which can cause contact  dermatitis. I get an allergic reaction on my eyelids every time I've used this product."

160,kopari beauty,bright as day sheer mineral sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2045118,2623888," * I love mineral sunscreen, this is one I might purchase again, but it is expensive. I like that it's tinted and doesn't have any white cast, but there is a little bit of a granular feeling to it. It rubs in pretty quick and the bottle lasted quite a while. * Im shocked at how amazing this is. Its SO LIGHT and dries down to be completely undetectable on the skin. Zero, and i mean zero heaviness or grease. The tint is pretty much non-existent! I have no idea why people are saying its not good for fair skin - the tint disappears. There is no scent either. Its just so incredible. Its HEAVEN under makeup too. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS! Kopari really hit it out the park with this formulation. * Unfortunately i got an allergic reaction to this sunscreen. I have acne-prone, dry skin thats super sensitive and got this recommended to me but unfortunately it did make my skin super red and itchy for a couple days after using it. I also had dry patches for about a week after use. * As some of the other reviewers have said, the color is not great on fair skin. It does come across as a bronzer, and somehow the shine in the formula seems to accentuate every wrinkle and pore. 

The smell is the reason that I'm returning it though. When you first bring your hands to your face to apply, there's a definitely whiff of a sour smell (like foot odor). It dissipates quickly, but I can't handle first thing in the morning every day :-( * I'm not sure why some of the reviews are bad. I find this sunscreen light, non-greasy, and doesn't irritate my skin. I don't see any glitter and the scent is nonexistent to me. Definitely will repurchase. * This has quickly become my favorite sunscreen. Every time I use it, someone compliments me on my skin. I have NO idea what other reviewers mean when they reference glitter. I just applied it and made sure to shake extra long and don't see glitter. There is a slight shimmer, but nothing close to glitter, in my opinion. It also doesn't break me out, which can be an issue for me with sunscreen. My only complaint is that it doesn't play as well with makeup as I would like. * ok guys I read reviews saying there was glitter. I had been using this for a week no issue. I  went on a vacation with this and noticed glitter on my face and hands....turns out I wasn't shaking the bottle before applying.   But while traveling the bottle was being shifted around and mixed up the glitter.  I'm not talking about gold dust shimmer....I'm talking actual glitter for possible craft time.   I really hate glitter I had take all my makeup off to get rid of it all .  If  you like  that much glitter pieces on your face then cool! you might love this one! but for me the glitter just drives me nuts.  the formula is ok ...it didn't irritate my skin. I would prob"

I was looking for a sunscreen to wear even when not by the pool but I didn't want to smell like traditional sunscreens. This one fit the bill. I was surprised by how well it worked. My one small complaint is that I wish it wasn't a twist cap. While this ensures it doesn't open accidentally it would be easier if it was a pop up top like other sunscreens. The hole the sunscreen comes out of could be a little bigger too. * This smells so good for sunscreen! The peach scent is lovely. I will say there is a hint of sunscreen aroma, its not going to be like a scented lotion. I would like to try some more fragrances and since I am a gourmand/vanilla girly, something like that would be amazing, but this will be awesome for summer :) why is sunscreen so expensive though lol * This is a 70 SPF product but it looks like a regular moisturizer on my face, not heavy or chalky. * The coola classic body lotion SPF 70 peach blossom is a good product. I use this product before leaving home or going to work in my garden. You have to apply daily to cleanse skin fifteen minutes before sun exposure. The scent of the peach blossom is not a heavy scent. The smell of this product is sweet and lightweight. The product applies easily to your skin. The product is a smooth, creamy texture and goes well on your skin. The body lotion doesn't leave your skin greasy. The coola body lotion kept my skin nourished and hydrated throughout the day. I love that this product has 80 minutes of water resistance and is designed  for long active days in the sun but is light enough for daily use. Also, I like that you can  reapply this product if necessary. I love this product and highly recommend it to my family and friends. ""This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review."" * I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. This product smells like fresh peaches. I like that it had a nice smell that lingered but was not too strong.  I am trying to get better with wearing sunscreen and often times the smell of it makes me not want to wear it. I also generally dislike the oiliness of most sunscreens.  I will say that this product was better than most at covering up the ""sunscreen smell.""     But you still could smell it which is why I gave it a 4 not a 5.   As far as feeling oily or heavy on your skin, it did not rub in as easily as I would have liked it too and it still did feel a bit oily, as if you need to wash it off at the end of the day with a wash cloth.    It was moisturizing to my skin though and I noticed a difference after only using it for a few days. Overall I would recommend it. * absolutely love this coola classic sunscreen. It's spf 70. It's also 70%organic, cruelty free,fluten free,vegan, and hawaii reef compliant!!! This sunscreen is scented peach blossom and smells sooo good!!! This sunscreen is perfect indoor and outdoor and for all seasons. I highly recommend this sunscreen for sun lovers!!! * I have been using it for a week now and I can say that I really like it: it has a pleasant smell, it absorbs well and does not leave white marks, it is ideal for tanning

I liked the feel of the formula and it rubbed in well. It's a larger size than many other bottles of face sunscreen. Thats the 2nd star. And I bougnt 2 of these. Nope. Never again. * As someone who breaks out to a lot of different skincare products, this is one of the few sunscreens that doesn't. I found no irritation around my eyes when I applied it, and it left no white cast on my medium skin! I love to buy it when its on sale. * This has been my go-to daily SPF ever since I started dealing with FA breakouts. I live in a very dry climate and find this is all the hydration I need for daytime. Lightweight feeling, doesn't pill or sting near my eyes, and plays nicely under makeup. Also layers/reapplies nicely throughout the day. Would love to eventually see a higher SPF in this same formula that's also FA-safe! * I like it! It's a small bottle, but, I like it!

Especially if you have dry skin. This also gets a good rating on the Yuka app which lets me rest at peace. I also appreciate the sustainability features. * This sunscreen does not work well for my skin during the summer months. The texture is initially very smooth and the consistency is like a thicker face moisturizer. It appears to absorb well after initial application, but even the smallest amount of face sweat will cancel out what had absorbed! So my face is left a greasy, sweaty, goopy mess. I tried multiple ways applying this, even going so far as using ONLY this sunscreen in the morning after washing my face (skipping actives and a lightweight moisturizer, which is my usual), with the same messy result when my face sweats. It does work better in the cooler months when there's less face sweat. I ended up using the rest of this tube on my body. * Very sticky and greasy. It didn't feel like it fully absorbed into my skin for several hours after applying, and honestly that may have just been it wearing off. * Somehow both greasy and drying. * I really like the thickness of this sunscreen. It doesn't leave your skin feeling oily and absorbs quickly. It also has a nice scent and doesn't smell like sunscreen. I wear it under makeup and it's perfect!

168,olehenriksen,banana bright mineral face sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2042274,2617219," * I almost never buy the same sunscreen twice because I never like them enough to repeat purchase, but here we are. This is not perfect, but it is very close. It disappears instantly and leaves no white cast - I think even those with darker skin tones could wear it (it is just barely tinted but not enough to impart any sort of color to the skin). The finish is natural matte - no shine or greasiness. I don't see the ""glow"" it claims to give, but I don't care about that. It smells nice and fresh, like a just peeled orange. The texture is a bit like mousse, but once you put it on it kind of liquifies and blends right in. It can definitely be a bit drying, like all zinc-based sunscreens, so absolutely start with a good moisturizer. I would recommend it for all but the very driest of skin. * Love this! The price is pricey, but worth it in my opinion. * This product is fantastic, I was excited to try as I use the other banana bright lotions. It goes on the same, very smooth and I love the color, just gives a glow but nothing too dark or heavy. Wore it all day on my face at the beach and did not get burned. * I must be sensitive to an ingredient in this sunscreen, because it made my skin red and irritated- very stingy. I like everything else about the sunscreen, so it's such a bummer. * I adore this mineral sunscreen, it absorbs beautifully and smells delicious, like oranges. The only facial mineral sunscreen I will wear. * Foundation doesnt blend good with this sunscreen. Would be ok if used alone and wasnt applying a full face. * This sunsceen pills so badly it's an absolute waste."

This hit the spot. It does feel more like a sunscreen due to the texture and smell, but it also gives a moisturized feeling after your am routine and doesn't feel drying. I don't often leave reviews, but as I am about to purchase my 3rd tube, I thought it was worthy! * I've been using this sunscreen for monyhs now. Im on my 4th bottle and I absolutely love it! I have extremely oily skin that's very sensitive. This product not only goes on like a dream and absorbs quickly(which is great for my inpatient rushes lol.) But it also helps mattify under primer and control my oily skin a bit. Now does it completely stop oil breakthroughs No! But lets be real there isn't a single matte or oil free product that will. It takes a routine and work if your skin is like mine. But now I'm being recommended to use physical(mineral) sunscreen due to my melasma. I'm struggling to find one that will work for my skin type and hating letting this one go! Highly recommend this product if you want a good matte, sheer, daily sunscreen. * I have been enjoying this! I have been using it for 2 months now. I'm always on the hunt for a good SPF/moisturizer duo just because I am trying not to add more steps to my skincare routine. Often times, at least with cheaper ones, they leave my face very shiny. Even after hours of wearing this one, I don't see my skin very greasy at all! It's worth a try, especially for this price point! * It goes on smooth and feels great. Unfortunately, the smell is so strong and unpleasant. I scrubbed my face twice after using and it's still awful. * I was advised to use this by my esthetician.  I have been using thos for a while now and i really like it. I have oily skin and i like thst it has SPF in it. I need to use items with SPF already in it, or ill forget. * After reading all the promises I thought this SPF would be perfect, but like other reviews mention this doesnt dry matte at all and I need to use a powder after applying. For the high price this should do what it says. Sounds like there was some sort of change in the formula that ruined it. * This was recommended by my esthetician. And it works well for me. I like that it has sun screen in it and it doesnt seem to make my face oily at all. It works for me."

It really works because when I have forgotten to use it, my shoulders are toast. They got burned once and I learned my lesson. I love the smell and often get compliments from others. I have not experienced any irritation with it and I have used it for years. It blends in wonderfully. And it's non greasy. People always ask me if I need to wipe my hands with a towel afterwards because I am about to play but I find that the lotion is pretty quick absorbing. Again, I don't use it on my face. I use Make it Matte on my face. Love the product! I don't think I've ever been so diligent with my sunscreen protection or committed to a brand like this until I used Black Girl Sunscreen.  Highly recommended! * I am an unpaid reviewer, but these other reviews are clearly biased bc of the brand name. I've been using BGS 50 for ~2 years, & it gives me no white case, my skin feels moisturized with use, it provides great coverage, no breakouts & price is great. * The lid doesnt function properly so

And it leaves a white cast and im lightskin so you can imagine what it foes for those more pigmented * I've been using used this product a little over three years. It works great on my skin. It also leaves a nice glow to my face and neck. * Easy to apply. Very creamy.
Luxurious feeling product. Smells great 
First time using this brand. Heard about from my niece tried it for myself and was very pleased with the results. The price was alright. Considering the sun screen itself was over my expectations. * Keeps my skin protected while adding a radiant glow that will leave your skin skinning 😂"
171,undefined beauty,r&r broad spectrum spf 50 sun serum,pimprod2035000,2616920," * It is tooooo dewy, and it gives a bit of itch * This spf is wayyy too dewy for me. I would go so far as to say it's past dewy, more wet finish. It never dries down and therefore ended up moving around on my face. I tried powdering to set, but it created a really awful texture. 

The light tint was a really great match for me (fair-light with cool undertones), but it also had a strange smell. Overall, just not for me! * [Combination skin, Fitzpatrick 4]

Leaving this glowing review because I need this sunscreen to be available forever. I have tried a MYRIAD of tinted mineral sunscreens over the years - Beauty of Joseon, EltaMD, Ultra Violette, Australian Gold, DRMTLGY, Purlisse, and Bliss, to name a few - and I have consistently gone back to this one. I love it even more after they added Hectorite Clay. The texture is silky and it goes on like a dream, wearing wonderfully with or without makeup. I use the medium shade, which is perfect for my skin. Once it sets, it doesn't transfer into my light-colored clothes, which makes it perfect for summer. Plus, unlike a lot of other SPF, this one also makes it possible to use the correct 2-finger amount without looking like the peanut butter baby - just blend one finger at a time! I also love that this SPF is travel-friendly but lasts a long time, thanks to its fluid formula. Finally, the price point is AMAZING, considering that this also includes antioxidant boosters and other skincare ingredients.

In general, I can't say enough good things about the R&R Sun Serum. I want this to be available forever, please and thank you! Some extra caveats and tips: 

- It can feel overly dewy at first, but give it 20 minutes to ""set"" (as you should with any SPF). After that, it leaves the prettiest glass-skin finish. If my combination skin is acting up, I just dab on a bit of powder or use a blotting paper. 
- The formula does contain tridecyl salicylate, which I believe is an SPF booster, but this is still considered a mineral sunscreen. FWIW, I'm sensitive to chemical sunscreens, and this doesn't irritate my skin or eyes at all. * This is a great sunscreen for everyday wear and reapplication! The texture is great for layering with or without makeup. I have rosacea and this has prevented flare ups from sun exposure so I will be repurchasing as long as they make it! * This sadly burned my eyes pretty bad, but it felt and looked nice on the skin overall. * This product is runny and its a mess. Not into runny products running through my hands or face. * The only ""light"" option isnt a good fot for all European or light skin tones.  It says its neutral but it leans pink/cool."
172,peter thomas roth,max mineral tinted sunscreen broad spectrum spf 45,pimprod2024035,2579755," * This is the only tinted sunscreen that doesn't flare up my rosacea. It goes on creamy and gives a light, natural coverage for even looking skin. For me, it lasts all day. * I have lots of acne and post inflammatory erythema. This tinted sunscreen doesn't have much tint. I have more fair to light skin and it is a little dark for me and therefore makes me skin almost look worse. it doesn't seem to even out any redness just makes it look like I have patchy darker skin tone in some areas. the finish is natural and glory and it's beautiful, but after wearing for about an hour or two the tint is almost all gone in some spots and looks so patchy. * So far this is the best mineral sunscreen I have found, yes even better than Tachas's. Tachas dries my skin and made it flaky eww. This stuff makes it moist reducess just as promised and keeps my face from sunburns. I don't like that at first when first applied my skin looks shiny but I prefer that to the dry film others leave and ive noticed that onces it has time to soke into my skin its fine. * I definetly recomend this as onenodnthe best mineral tinted sunblocks I be ever found. * Best spf! Mineral based. Doesn't pill. Nice tint (medium to very light tan skin tone). Helps skin look good. Pair it with powder= compliments on my skin. Hard to find when I first started using. Glad I spoke up back in the day.  Please do not ever stop making this product or change I ingredients. * I have spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars in search of a sunscreen that doesn't have me reluctant to apply it in the morning. I've done my research and know that mineral sunscreens are generally considered more effective than chemical sunscreens, but most mineral sunscreens leave a white cast, pill under makeup or over skincare, or leave my skin dried out by the end if the day. 
This Peter Thomas Roth tinted sunscreen is the first sunscreen I have used that doesnt do any of that. It's the most cosmetically elegant sunscreen I've found as it applies like a blurring, color correcting primer. The tint is a neutral tone with a slight yellow hue I would say. It is so much nicer than the other tinted sunscreens I have tried that leave me with an orange or pink coat on my face. It dries down to a satin matte finish, and most of my makeup products layer nicely over it. The only reason it loses a star is I find it settles under my eyes and makes my IT Cosmetics bye bye under eye concealer (a reliable holy grail concealer for me) crease under my eyes by the end of the day. It's likely only noticeable to me, but that's my only complaint. If you're better at setting your undereyes than I am, this will probably check all of your boxes. I've definitely found my go-to sunscreen. * I have searched high and low for a high spf that ALWAYS pairs well with other skincare products and/or with makeup without pilling. This does the perfect job. I wear it alone or it is a perfect base before makeup. I've repurchaed it 3 times and will continue to do so."
173,murad,correct & protect broad spectrum spf 45| pa++++,pimprod2031643,2592791," * Chemical sunscreen causes my eczema to flare, and most physical sunscreens leave a horrific white cast. This does not. It's also fragrance free.

The bottle is so tiny for the price, which is the biggest con. But otherwise I have zero complaints. * I tried super goop because everyone said it was so good but it left a dirty feeling residue on my face in turn making my makeup splotchy this sunscreen does not do this also does not leave a white cast on your face i also love that this product heals while protecting * I am so in love with this product that I buying it for Xmas to give it as a gift to my family and friend * This serum has good healthy ingredients but the mineral sunblock that is in it ruins the whole serum. The serum will not melt into your skin. Then if you put makeup on over it, the makeup will not apply evenly and the makeup sits on top of your pores and fine lines and accentuates them! This serum also was not as greaseless as I had hoped. It was a little greasy. So I don't recommend this serum at all. The sunblock in it is 17% Zinc Oxide. That is most likely the reason it never melts into your skin. The price is also very expensive. * It blends into the skin without any white cast but I feel it doesn't get absorbed easily, feels greasy and uncomfirtable on my skin. I can't get past the fact that it feels tacky on the skin for such a long time. For the price point, I'm sure there are much better product out there . * sensitive enough on eczema prone skin during the summer time! * Had high hopes but, after using the full bottle, I did not see any ""Correct""ing benefit. BThey should take this word out of the name, it is misleading.  Also it smells a bit unpleasant which mostly dissipates.
It did give me sun protection but I can get that from a much less expensive product.
Overall a disappointment."

GROSS. * I started buying this product about 3 years ago when I hit 45 years young, that is when the wrinkles started. Since then it has really helped with the wrinkles and face felling smooth and looking healthy. I let my mom use it and now she is hooked as well! * It's sunscreen in a nice skincare bottle. It works, but feels nothing like a face cream and everything like any regular sunscreen. * It's a cute bottle but it jsut smells like straight sunscreen. It's not that greasy but it's nothing special. * Love this for daytime. Light, and I don't need very much. Gentle on my sensitive skin. * We accidentally ran out of this, and we will never take this product for granted again! * It was just too greasy it started to break my skin out"

I had to pull over to the side of the road, my eye would not stop leaking for 10 minutes. It burns so bad and continues to burn after I rinsed my eyes out too. For the record, I do not put spf on or around my eyes either because I wear sunglasses and it STILL got in my eyes. * The only thing I can say is I love this product * When I first received this product, I told myself, no way I am buying this again for a sunscreen (because of the size for the price). However, as soon as I put it on I fell in love. It smells great, leaves your skin super soft, and it stays soft! I have an oily complexion so I have yet to put it on my face because it does feel a bit oily when you put it on. However, I noticed if you rub it in properly it just sinks into your skin. My neck and chest in particular look and feel amazing after using this.  Its not over powering, it doesnt leave a cast, a little goes a long way, and I did not have any irritaion. Yes, it is pricey, but like the other Shiseido products I have tried, I love it. * Perfect sun block, sits well under make up and gives a nice glow when I wear it alone. I am medium/tan and does not leave a white cast. 
Wish the fullsize had the same dispenser as the travel size. * I was hoping this sunscreen would feel more like a lotion or a serum but it feels EXTREMELY oily, even after shaking the bottle for a while. It felt like it was just sitting on top of my skin and never absorbed. I had a significant breakout after using it for a few days, this is the first sunscreen I've tried that caused my skin to break out in many small pustules all over my face. * It smells like peaches, is light weight and feels like a serum when you apply it. It doesn't pill or burn your eye. * It smells like peaches, is light weight and feels like a serum when you apply it. It doesn't pill or burn your eye."

Ulta refused to return it because outside of return window. Informed Coola of the reaction. They offered a refund * I've been using this sunscreen for a few years now and really like it! It works well for me because it's a sunscreen I'll actually wear. I love the soft non- greasy feel of this product. I don't feel slick or sticky when I apply it and I've never had it irritate my skin. I also love that it truly has no fragrance at all! I'm of  European heritage and have very pale pink skin and this sunscreen looks quite natural on me. It keeps me from burning and keeps my skin comfortable and looking good while doing so. I couldn't ask for more. * I have very sensitive skin so I have to use a fragrance free mineral sunscreen.  This is one of the best mineral sunscreens I have found.  It sinks in well and dries to a non-tacky finish so I can use it for every day without it being a greasy mess.  You do have to rub it in, but that is to be expected with a mineral sunscreen.  The best part is that it does not rub off onto your clothes like some mineral sunscreens do. * This product is horrible if you have any skin tone except fair. Literally so white and even with 5 minutes of rubbing it into your skin, your skin is grey with stripes of whote because it does not absorb. I have medium tan skin and it makes me look ill.

Save your money! * Used this on a trip to Hawaii (this is a reef safe sunscreen) - my kids used it when they went snorkeling. It does leave a white cast on skin, but that is to be expected considering the active ingredients and the high SPF. They came back from the snorkeling trip with a nice tan (we have naturally olive skin, so we tan even with sunscreen) and no burns. I use this regularly on my face to boost the SPF from my daytime moisturizer. It does not feel greasy and it doesn't appear shiny at all. There is an almost imperceptible (not visible in photographs) white cast, but I can live with that. I also use it on the backs of my hands and arms to prevent a ""car tan"" and it has worked well for that so far. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and I would buy it again. * Do not buy! I'm actually headed to Ulta right now to return this. It'll leave a white cast on any skin tone! And it doesn't blend into the skin no matter how much you rub it in. It's also really dry feeling.

My only gone is that it is so small and when you get to the end of the stick, so much product can go to waste, because it's all stuck at the bottom. * Amazing. No white cast. Just too small but love it * This little thing of nothing only lasted one day! Used for reapplication while running errands, and hardly any product in the container.

While the glow is nice and it is great for SPF, it broke me out because of one ingredient (bismuth). In the new year I am trying to remove all skin irritants and unfortunately I will not be able to repurchase this product. * I like this sunscreen, it is light and absorbs easy and leaves a really nice glowy finish. The downside is that it STAINS clothing and does not wash out. I realized this a little late, and I'm stuck with a bunch of shirts that have a brown stain around the collar and sleeves. The packaging also sucks, the product runs out the top often and spills out. * amazing! but the packaging sometimes leaks out of the bottle into the cap. otherwise i am so obsessed!! 🦍☀️ * I want to love this sunscreen, but the packaging is such a deal breaker that I can't justify purchasing it anymore. The screw-on cap does not work with how quickly the liquid product flows out of the tube. The formula would make so much more sense with a pump dispenser or some other type that would prevent mess when using it. I have to believe that the packaging hasn't been improved in order to keep the price low, but it just defeats the cost benefit when I waste product becauss too much flows out. I'd pay a bit more for this product if I could use it without wasting it. I won't be purchasing again unless the packaging is updated based on customer feedback. Sunbum, please fix this! * I've tried quite a few different sunblocks for my face, and they all feel way too thick and make my face feel oily. This is my absolute favorite that I've ever used! It leaves such a nice glow and honestly makes my skin look great. I want to try wearing it as a daily sunblock, but am a little worried that daily use will cause my skin break out, but I guess that I won't know until I try! I do wish they made this in a bigger bottle so that it could be used for the entire body. * I don't know why i keep trying to like sun bum products. They're all mid or below. This sunscreen is basically a liquid. I was expecting more of a lotion type of formula. It is very runny, so when you go to dispense product, be careful and don't squeeze- otherwise you'll make a mess. * IT ACTUALLY WORKS ON ALL SKIN TONES AND COLORS.
I LOVE this sunscreen it is moisturizing while providing sun protection and a BEATIFUL GLOW. It works well under makeup also. I do recommend applying an actual moisturizer on with it because it works as dew drops. It provides great protection.

Feels just like a mosturizer
Would definitely recommend for those like me with texture and scent sensetivities. I haven't found any other sunscreen this great! * I don't consider myself to have sensitive skin- acne prone, yes, but not sensitive. I can throw everything but the kitchen sink at my skin when it comes to exfoliating and my skin takes it beautifully. I used this product daily for about a month and started to see some irritation. Thought it was maybe the change in seasons or my other actives. I cut back on those products and the irritation got worse. Started to look like a rash / dermatitis thats caused by heavy moisturizers. Didnt even think thats it was the sunscreen until it was literally the only ""new"" product on my face. Went back to look at the product more closely. Contains coconut oil, which as an acne prone girly, I know this is very comedogenic / clogs pores / causes dermatitis. Sad because I liked everything else about the product- price, packaging, consistency, absorption, efficacy. Just doesn't work for my skin. 😞 * I started using this sunscreen and I genuinely do like the way it feels on my face and has a pleasent scent! It does protect well considering I was outside for hours and my face did not burned however, if it got into my eyes (just from me rubbing or from sweating) and it would continuously keep burning my eyes. 

I really want to like it however, I may switch back to bare republic mineral sunscreen since I had no issue with that."

It leaves a beautiful glow and deeply hydrates but again, not for oily skin or if you leave in hot weather.Too heavy for a day cream * I got this product with high hopes. It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy.

I am always excited to try new sunscreen products as good ones are hard to find. This was immediately really oily and did not dry down like the other comments mention. I couldnt imagine putting makeup on top (I didn't since i was just going to the pool for a few hours). After about 30 minutes in the sun there was a burning sensation all over my face. My skin is generally not sensative to any products but this one did not sit well on my skin. It was a low UV day and party cloudy but it feels like I got a really bad sun burn on my face. * I got this in a sample pack with another order. I was excited to try it because I prefer mineral sunscreen to chemical and use sunscreen daily. I would strongly recommend trying this in store or a sample before buying. It does have an essential oil scent and has a pink tone to it, which may not work for all skintones. It is also very greasy. My baseline skintype is normal to dry and I used this without moisturizer and looked like I had been out in the sun all day sweating. It didn't dry down on its own and had to be set with a powder to be workable, which is not what I have to do with other sunscreens. This may work for some people, but I was not one. I would say try before you buy! * I tried multiple times to wear this. I always let it set for a while before applying makeup and it does not soak in completely. It did not pill with serums or makeup and is hydrating. However, EVERY time I was in the sun, my face stung. I do use a retinoid and something in this just irritated my skin after a while. It did not hold up with sweat (causing my eyes to sting) and it did not keep me from burning. I live in Florida and definitely a no go for summer heat. * This takes a long time to dry down and isn't very illuminating. * So this dispenser is very skinny so not alot comes out at once. You have to keep squeezing to get out enough. Its also super illuminating, so for both these reasons I didnt use enough product. That is on me, but the price point for the tiny bottle that's hard to squeeze makes it not work for me. I also could see how some would find it greasy feeling. The finish is beautiful though. * I bought this because the reviews seemed great. This did not work well for my skin. Instantly made me super oily. I have sensitive skin so I'm glad this didn't make me break out nor havd an allergic reaction. * Why do the online ingredients not list fragrance? The box does. It smells strongly of essential oils. I literally hated putting it on my face. And if that wasnt bad enough, it stayed wet for hours. What the brand calls 'illuminating' looks oily to me. I wish this had been in stores to try before buying as I could have saved having to return it."

Total waste of money. There's no setting properties to this spray it's quite literally just spraying regular SPF 50 on your face. * couldn't get past the chemical smell or stickiness on my face. did not like the product * While I want to love this as an easy means to reapply sunscreen throughout the day specifically designed for the face, it breaks me out. Its small enough to be relatively travel friendly and the spf aspect works great, I've brought it with me to reapply many places and for all over my body as well as others and everyone who i know thats used it hasnt had any issues with it's effectiveness, i cant use it if it breaks me out. Im not prone to breakout at all. I think its the fragrance, im not a huge fan of the scent either.

It provides a lovely, refreshing boost to your skin, especially on hot, sunny days. The formula is lightweight and non-greasy, leaving no sticky residue or shine on the skin. What's more, it's perfect for indoor use, as it doesn't contain high levels of sunscreen, yet still offers numerous benefits. I'm particularly fond of the fact that this product is vegan, cruelty-free, and made with clean, organic ingredients. Overall, I highly recommend it. Additionally, its compact size makes it perfect to take on the go, fitting nicely in your purse or clutch. Although it's a bit pricey for my liking, considering it's a sunscreen product, I believe the clean ingredients used by this brand justify the cost. ""This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review,"" * I'm so sad! I used to LOVE this product. It would give me the most beautiful dewy finish and smelled amazing. I just bought a new bottle yesterday in-store and it's completely different. The smell is similar but not nearly as good, the moist is not as fine, and IT DOESNT HAVE A DEWY FINISH!!! It just seems like I spraying water in my face now with no other benefits. * I love this brand, but I would not buy this again. I have purchased this 3 times (for myself and family), and all 3 times the bottle has leaked all over my bag, and wasted money. Get the lotion and save your money. * I sprayed this on my face before driving home from work and within 20 minutes my eyes were stinging and burning. Im guessing it migrated into my eyes. Also the coconut fragrance lingers on your face for a long time. Really disappoint overall and cant wait for my eyes to stop burning. * It's a light mist that does feels slightly sunscreeny- but not too much that it turns me away from it. I have oily skin and I hate using face spf for that reason so I wanted to try this instead. I like the light feel and it didn't irritate my skin. * I like that it doesn't have alcohol or a smell like the setting spray version but it is pretty oily when applied. Also wish the SPF was higher. I went though the bottle quick since I kept reapplying before I noticed how oily it made me. It would be great for dry skin girlies. * I think there are better spray sunscreens on the market for a better price. I'm really debating on returning this. I've used it three times, and each time I'm happy with the glow, but it very quickly turns to grease and my makeup slides off. I think for the price, you're better off getting something else. Also, the packaging is pretty but it's not practical. I bought this to put in my pool bag and my hiking pack, but it's glass packaging… I get making sustainable packaging but this isn't practical for what I'm using it for."
188,neutrogena,"sport face oil-free lotion sunscreen, spf 70+",pimprod2032290,2595050," * I began using this sunscreen years ago and like others, am not a fan of the new motor oil smell of the current formula.
I continue to use it because, although the smell is terrible, the formula remains effective and keeps me from burning in intense sun and it's modestly priced for an oil free sunscreen that's high in SPF protection. That's what keeps me coming back. 
Keep in mind, this is a sunscreen lotion and not advertised to be a daily moisturizer. I use another SPF product by the same brand for daily use. I only apply this product prior to outdoor activities. * This is my tride and true. It looks fabuslous on its own and underneath makeup. There is a slight white cast that is eliminated with enough blending. I also notice it helps lessen the amount of sweat thats produced on my face. I workout everyday in an unconditioned gym in the south, need i say more?

This is it * I hate this sunscreen. I thought it would have a flawless finish like all the korean chemical sunscreens I like. It leaves a white cast on my face as if it were a mineral sunscreen and does not completely rub in no matter how much I work it in. And then it does not dry fully either, it just sits on top of skin. Surprisingly, it doesnt make foundation pill, so that gets a star. I will not repurchase. * I didnt get a sunburn but it is very hard to rub in so you need to apply alot of product. * I used the old version for years and it was nearly perfect; hydrating, easily spread, and non irritating. The new version takes a lot of work to spread in, leaves a white cast on my skin(nc45), clings to hairs, and isn't hydrating enough. * I've tried a few sport sunscreens and this is one of my favorites. I wear it everyday before my workouts to protect my skin outdoors and indoors from harmful UVA/UVB rays. I sweat a lot and it doesn't burn or sting my eyes which is a plus. One of the cons I have to note for others is, it is a little bit thick and greasy like a lot of sunscreens, but that doesn't really bother me personally. * Leaves you with a white cast after trying to rub it in."
189,coola,refreshing water plumping gel serum sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2043266,2620583," * This has quickly become a must have product for me! I always have issues with sunscreens looking cakey under makeup, not being hydrating enough, or looking greasy throughout the day. I'm also always in a rush in the morning, so I really only want to wait a minute or two for my skincare to sink in before putting on my makeup. I was on the hunt for a suncreen with a serum consistency that wore well under makeup on my dry skin. This is just that and MORE! 

The first time I used it, I was blown away by how it made my skin look throughout the day. It was like I had a smoothing filter on. My makeup actually looks better with this on underneath! That is something no other suncreen has done for me. It's also very plumping and calming for my tired morning skin. On top of all of that, I actually did notice that my skin looked more relaxed than usual at the end of my work day in tech. I swear staring at a screen all day is giving me fine lines, so I was excited to see the digital de-stress technology, but I definitely did not expect to see immediate benefits. I assumed it would be more of an overtime thing. That was a fantastic surprise that really pushed this product over the top for me! * after a couple hours of applying i got a terrible rash on my face and neck. it got super red and itchy. i do have sensitive skin and always use mineral sunscreens so that may be why but ive just never had anything like this happen before. nothing this major * I love this moisturizer! From the first touch, I knew it would be a game-changer for my dry skin. Honestly, it's so different from the texture: a lightweight gel that hugs the skin like a cloud. It melts into my skin, leaving it plump, refreshed, and super-smooth. This is amazing. I've never felt this moisturized, and my skin is still dewy hours later. One of the best parts about this produce is how light it feels. Though it provides such intense moisture, it does not feel heavy or greasy. It just wakes up my skin in the morning and keeps it looking fresh and dewy. It layers beautifully with other skincare products, and I have had no issues applying makeup over it. GET THIS PLEASE ESPECIALLY DRY SKIN GIRLS!

 ""Product received as part of an educational education."" * about me:
skin: combo-oily
makeup: yes, and I double cleanse and prep skin.

I've been trying this sunscreen for some time now. While I can say it feels nice on the skin, it unfortunately broke me out quite a bit. For one, it is relatively fragranced, which I'm not usually opposed to but can see this being an issue for some. I do wear it underneath my makeup after i've prepped my skin and give it enough time to try, but have noticed that by the end of the day I significantly more oilier than if I prepped my skin without it. I don't doubt that the sunscreen doesn't allow my skin to breathe nearly as much, but I probably wouldnt recommend this product to someone who is looking to apply it under makeup or have sensitive to oilier skin - which is unfortunate as I was hoping the serum aspect of the product would have been better for my skin type compared to a thicker mineral type sunscreen. Overall, its not ""bad"", just not for me! * i got this for free and i was very excited to try the brand. while it had a great feel on the face, i did not like the white cast that it left. i decided that even though there was a white cast, i was going to purchase it when i ran out until i noticed the price. there are sunscreens out there that do the same thing for a fraction of the price. im not willing to pay almost $50 for a sunscreen. * I did not expect much from this sunscreen at all, honestly. I usually stick with Asian sunscreens as they have exceptionally elegant lightweight formulas with filters far more advanced than those you can find in the US. I got a sample of this, however, and was genuinely surprised by the formula and how it felt on the skin. For reference, I have oily-combination skin, so a light SPF is a must. This sunscreen definitely fit its description of a gel serum- I would say that's definitely how it felt going on (maybe a tad bit more of a gel cream, but still quite light, regardless), and in my experience, it sinks in quite quickly while still leaving the skin feeling the skin hydrated and moisturized. I don't typically use moisturizer when I use this, but that's just what works for my skin personally. I have very sensitive eyes and this also did not sting my eyes at all when applied around my eye area, which is a huge plus for me as that can turn me off from a sunscreen completely. Different things work differently for everyone so I would still recommend getting a sample and trying before spending this much on a sunscreen, especially as there are lots of incredible SPFs that are MUCH more affordable, but finding a sunscreen thats actually enjoyable to use can be extremely hard so I definitely appreciate finding one (a US sunscreen, at that) that feels this nice and would absolutely recommend.

***This was purchased with my own money. This is NOT a sponsored review in any way and all opinions are my own. * I'm always on the hunt for a sunscreen for my face that doesn't feel sticky and hot.  This one isn't quite the naked feel I'd like, but I think it's the best I've found so far.  Unfortunately the cap won't come off so I have to screw off the top to access the product.  I'm assuming there's a pump under the cap which would really be convenient, but I'm going to have to pour the product into my hand.  Disappointed in this defect for the price of the product."

It leaves such a bad white cast, I turned purple.(Couldn't add an image but there's proof) For reference I'm black. To add to this, I don't know anyone I can donate this to. To put this in perspective I have sports sunscreen which melds perfectly with no cast, I'll be going back to that. * Leaves white cast on skin, if  you're tan I do not recommend this at all. Makes you look ashy. * Left a white cast that wouldnt go away. And it doesnt rub into the skin. * Do not buy this product. It was so bad it was on special and now i know why. Leaves a white cast, is greasy, and doesn't absorb into the skin at all * I absolutely hated this sunscreen. Worst white cast ever, you cant make it go away no matter how much you rub it in you will still go down 3 shades once you put it on. since I have sensitive skin I thought I would try out this brand but it made my skin issues worse. Also, not a great sunscreen to wear if you are planning on getting in bodies of water. I should have looked at reviews first before buying do not make my mistake. 
L * Stains everything white and doesnt ever absorb. I feel dirty for the rest of the day and look like I'm covered in lead paint makeup. Can not express how much I hate this sunscreen. * Horrible product. Leaves a white residue on the skin even after 12 h of application. Buy only if you wanna look like a clown"
191,dermalogica,invisible physical defense sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2014440,2560948," * Butyloctyl Salicylate or any Salicylates in sunscreens is not a true Mineral Sunscreen! This gave rash going on 2 days now. I did deep dive into ingredients. At this price point why use Butyloctyl Salicylate? Do better dermalogica! I do not recommend for price and chemical Butyloctyl salicylate trying to pass it off for Mineral sunscreen. * Love this mineral sunscreen! Used to use Aveda's mineral sunscreen but switched to this one a couple years ago and I'm so glad I did. This has a higher amount of zinc oxide, and slightly less white cast. Plus, the hyalauronic acid keeps my face looking hydrated—Goop's mineral sunscreen has a nice smooth texture but very drying and makes my skin look cakey. I struggle with melasma due to sun or heat exposure, and this Dermalogica mineral sunscreen is great for daily use. However, if I'm spending the day outside like at the beach or park or hiking, I do have to use something stronger to keep melasma and sun spots at bay—like Nuetrogena sheet zinc face mineral sunscreen. Nuetrogena leaves a brighter white cast because it has higher zinc oxide, but it fully protects my skin from direct sun. * This is WAY too thick! I couldn't spread it around. I will be returning this. * Great protection from sun with 20% zinc oxide! * It leaves a white cast, * I wanted to love this sunscreen since I love Dermalogica products but it does have a heavy greasy feel once applied on your face. Unfortunately, I will be returning this. I have a medium complexion and combination skin. It did not leave a white cast. * Estoy feliz de averiguar encontrado ente producto soy alérgica al sol y necesitaba encontrar un protector físico estaba desesperada por mi alergia micara y cuello y brazos llenos de ronchas no sabía la diferencia entre físico y químico cada año iba a emergencias por los granos odio tomar medicamentos ahora estoy con mi bolsa vacía pero sin granos gracias dermalogica"
192,coola,zinc oxide liplux sunscreen trio,pimprod2013049,2562546," * No overwhelming bad taste.  Nice colors.  Lasts waaay longer than other products I've tried.  Offers effective sun protection.  It IS a little drying but only a LITTLE.  I've tried sooo many different tinted sunscreen lip balms.  This one is top quality as far as I'm concerned. * Terrible chalky texture. Colors are not flattering. I'm still searching for a decent spf tinted balm. Tossing these. * These are soooo dry. Feels horrible!! Will be returning asap * The Coral Reef shade didn't come in my set, Firecracker did. I was looking forward to trying the coral shade the most. Just wish the set was actually the colors advertised! I think the formula is decent, but a little overpriced. * I really like thses.  They smell so good, like mint.
Wish they were available in store. * First off I'd like to say that this is the first time I've tried a tinted SPF lip balm! And I really like what I've tried so far! I've tried these for about 10 days and I really like how they feel on my lips. They are very moisturizing, silk texture and made in such pretty colors! My favorite is the Firecracker color. I like how nicely it glides on and doesn't feel cakey nor weighed down. I love the fact that these has SPF and I don't have to worry when I'm swimming at the pool if I get dried out lips. Also love the fact that this is organic, Vegan, and made with natural ingredient's and safe for the earth. Such high quality products and I'd love to test out other lip balm colors and also try other COOLA products! Perfect for the beach! * First off, I've only been using these for about 5 days and I'm absolutely OBSESSED. I love that it comes in 3 different shades and flavors but mainly the variety!

One of the first things I noticed about the lip sunscreen is how well it works, some products it takes a few days of using it for the effects to really work but this worked immediately, usually my lips crack and dry out depending how long I'm outside but this actually hydrated and protected them from cracking or drying out. One of the other things I loved was the fact you can barely even tell your wearing it! It doesn't feel weird or oily or cakey! And the other thing I loved was the fact it came with 3 different flavors! I highly recommend this product for anyone wanting the perfect go to lip sunscreen!!

Smells good too!  Will buy again! * The smell is great, but the sunscreen itself is awful. Even after reapplying it did NOT work. Do not get this sunscreen. The price and the awful sunburn afterwards is definitely NOT worth it!!! * Second time I've tried a sunscreen from Coola very disappointed both times. The scent is horrible and smells old even though it isn't expired. It will ruin your day is you put it on before heading out to the beach/pool because the smell is so awful * The texture is really nice, but the smell is off. Has a stale smell * Coola's sunscreen lotion went on easy and without a greasy, oily film. It lasted well throughout the day, and smelled great! * Put this on before going to the beach and then reapplied, still ended up a lobster. Not a fan unfortunately :( * This product gets the job done. Feels smooth on skin without feeling greasy. I also appreciate the business model of Coola. Scent is not fresh and tropical like piña colada infers. I'll use this again but maybe buy a different scent next time"

I am a light warm olive tone and this works great for me. Its not fragrant but it does have ascent similar to the Laroche Posay tinted but thats mild and dissipates. This spf is also more hydrating than the Laroche Posay in my opinion as well as having a lighter, more neutral tint with a similar liquid consistency .I was suprised it doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes. I can use it under and over my lids and thats a big deal! My other skincare products are all FAB so it made sense to check it out! The literal only complaint i have is that it isnt water resistant. So i have to grab something else when i go on vacation, etc. this is a perfect your skin but better finish! * I love this product so much I am literally on my fourth bottle! I've always had problems with sunscreens burning my face an eyelids however this is the only one I've ever found to not give me that problem. I like that it's a little bit tinted and makes my skin look even while providing SPF coverage. love love love * I have dry, fair, sensitive skin. This sunscreen is great. I put it on after my serum and moisturizer. I've been using it for about a year. No irritation, no sunburn. Good stuff. * I'm way too pale for this. If you're the lightest shade of foundations fair/pale you're not the target demographic * I used this product for the first time while on spring break- so my skin been dormant the last 5-6 months.

196,beekman 1802,hello sunshine spf 50 pa ++++,pimprod2045017,2624005," * I was probably 50 before I learned that sunscreen is an important part of skincare. Being richly melanated, I took my natural protection for granted (think MAC NW45). But when I started to notice fine lines on my forehead, thanks to my sunroof that is always open, I began to realize even I need sunscreen. I have tried different ones over the years, all with great qualities. But for me, I need a specific combination - high protection, no white cast and very hydrating and moisturizing for my dry/mature slightly sensitive skin. Beekman has been on my radar recently, and I gave their better aging line a try. I'm loving it! This was the next try, and I love it! It's more protective than my beloved SPF 30 sunscreen that shall always remain in rotation, but just as dewy and hydrating, maybe more so. (I keep that one in my purse as a hand cream and backup.) SPF 50! and more pluses than I've ever seen! PA++++! I'm just a couple of weeks in and I'm loving the feel and the protection. I usually wear over my favorite essences and serums, including my vitamin C serum. Sometimes with or without moisturizer underneath. And always on my hands and wrists too, ladies! Lovely on my face, neck and decollette. It's a generous size too. So many facial sunscreens are only 2 oz, some even less. This one is a generous 5 oz. It's a big tube, and it will last a long time. Loving it! * It hydrates my skin well✨️ and it doesn't flake. I wear it everyday and twice a day if im outdoors. I wish they had travel size for small bags/hipbags. * Wouldn't buy it again for my skin I got a reaction towards it where my face broke out even though it feel smooth I noticed my face but getting little bumps that I didn't have before. * ""I was excited to try the Beekman 1802 Hello Sunshine SPF 50, and I love the texture—it feels great on the skin and layers well under makeup, giving a nice glowy finish. The sun protection is solid too, but unfortunately, the 10% octocrylene in the formula makes my eyes teary and uncomfortable. I really wanted to love this sunscreen, but due to the irritation, I have to return it. If you have sensitive eyes, be cautious. Otherwise, it's a good product for sun protection and a radiant look. * I love how well this absorbs and it has no white cast. It also helps in reducing wrinkles and prevents accelerated aging. It's a win win! This non greasy, lightweight formula works great on my sensitive skin. This is also reef safe, sweat & water resistant & super hydrating. I received this free for my honest opinion and am posting here with no obligation. * Beekman 1802 Hello Sunshine SPF 50 PA ++++ is a clinically proven sunscreen for face and body with goat milk and chebula fruit to protect against accelerated aging. Provides daily defense with SPF 50 and the highest PA rating to reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles and prevent future sun damage. I love this sunscreen, it's my go to, the thing I can't live without, and my everyday sunscreen! We all know how important it is to use sunscreen and this is the only one I've found that just melts into your skin! No flakes! No clumps! I would absolutely. recommend this product to everyone because sunscreen is so important for healthy and protected skin. * This sunscreen Is FINALLY what I've been looking for. I am super senstive, dry, acne prone skin and the fact I can put tbis one and not have ANY skin flushing, tingling, or irritation makes me so happy! I put this on everywhere and it does not make my eyes sting or water, YAY! 

I love how lightwieght it is and just seems to blend into the skin immediately. It really feels more like a regular moisturizer that has sunscreen than a suncreen with moisture. 

As an esthetician, this will definitely be what i recommend to my clients!"
197,kinship,self reflect sport sunscreen spf 60,pimprod2031257,2593029," * Finally a high quality mineral spf that works for my dry skin. I live in hot humid Tampa Florida and I wanted to switch to a mineral based spf. This is an excellent product that I've repurchased 10 times now and will continue to repurchase. Great! * I do not know what magic they put in this, but they cracked the code. I am a medium skinned black woman and there is no white caste, even after working out for an hour! Also, it is so comfortable, it does not feel like you are wearing anything AND it is very moisturizing.  I could not stop touching my face. 
This version is better than the non sweatproof version and the best mineral sunscreen I have ever tried, and I have tried a lot. * This is perfect for your outdoor activities--high SPF , water/sweat resistant with very minimal white cast for a zinc-only sunscreen at that high SPF (give it a little time for the slight white to dissipate-note however that i am fairly pale). I also use this on my neck and chest for everyday wear because it doesnt get ""orange"" tint on my collars and 
clothing like my everyday tinted spf does. It feels moisturizing in the skin. It is very different from kinships spf 30 product although I Highly recommend you try both!! * first one suits my sensitive skin, no more irritation and watery eyes due to sunscreen * I love the other Kinship SPF so I thought I'd give this one a try since it's ""water resistant"" and SPF60. I don't see HOW this is water resistant because it never sets and its continuously greasy, on top of that my skin STILL managed to dry out two hours after I've applied it. It rubs off into everything and if you touch your face at any point in the day (I've worn it for 6+ hours) it moves and gets into everything. I've almost finished the whole tube thinking maybe it's user error... it could still possibly be the case. I'm 30 with rosacea, combination dry skin with hormonal breaks out and a thyroid condition that tends to dry my skin and hair out.. I wanted to like this sunscreen but it's a big no. I can't make it work, I've tried it alone, with moisturizer, under makeup, with serum only. I don't feel protected when I wear this sunscreen. It's also got this iridescence to it that at first I thought I would like but it just makes you look like *shiny* vampire. * After using the kinship self reflect spf 30 for several months, this sunscreen is definately my preference over the self reflect. This sunscreen has a very natural satin finish and is very hyrdating without being greasy, while the self reflect spf 30 has a dewy finish and is more lightweight. It takes about 5 minute after application for it to absorb and the cast to disappear. The long term benefits for my very sensitive combo skin have been amazing. The keratosis bumps on my cheeks have completely disappeared and this is the only product I have change in my routine. It has a very subtle vanilla scent that disapears shortly after application. Also the cast is hardly noticable on pale-medium skin. My friend with dark skin borrowed some and said that even though there was a slight white cast for her, it was surprisingly subtle given how high spf it is. This sunscreen has replaced my foundation at this point because  texture of my skin has improved so much since using it. I wish kinship made a body sunscreen like this. Kinship is a solid clean skincare brand and most of my products are from kinship since they are only of the few brands that cause irritation for me. If you have sensitive combo skin I would especially recommend this brand. * After using the kinship self reflect spf 30 for several months, this sunscreen is definately my preference over the self reflect.

""""Product was received as part of an educational promotion. * I am a licensed Esthetician and came across Coola when I started looking seriously for brands that were cruelty free and now farm to face. There are so many great ingredients in this product like hyaluronic acid, coconut water, Jasmine, basil just to name a few.
These great ingredients have helped my skin tremendously.
After using it for just one week,1 have been not using my regular make up but only this sunscreen moisturizer during the day. My skin looks great with no makeup.
It is great to have a SPF that works like skincare in my routine and is helping with the anti aging process to boot. I am definitely going to be using this all year because UV rays are always out and we need to be protected. Thanks for another great product I am a huge fan of this product too.
Product was received as part of an educational promotion. * This doesn't blend into the skin, but rather sits in top and leaves a white cast.

Maybe a bit of oil in this product would help?? * Ive got real sensitive and acne prone skin. So any new product I introduce to my face, my skin will let me know it doesn't like it by breaking me out instantly. Usually by the next morning. I could not find a sunscreen that didn't do this.

After about 6 hrs i had to wash it off bc my skin was getting extremely red, itchy, and dry. I have oily and acne prone skin that i dont consider sensitive. It took a week for my skin to go back to normal and im still recovering from ghe breakouts. * Love how matte my skin looks.

It moisturizes my skin and i can lather it on when I'm not wearing makeup. It makes my skin look so healthy. I've turned on 4 of my family members and a handful of friends to this. * The texture is oily and my makeup does not sit well over it. But the worst part about this item is that it smells terrible! * I didn't like the texture and it was grossly oily * I've tried many primers with SPF, and this is my favorite as it actually blurs pores the most and has the highest SPF. It's my daily primer. * I liked this spf until it reached the end. The bottle was very hard to swueeze. I was about to throw it out and decided to cut the package. There was still anton of product left! * It works very well under my makeup and makes my skin look younger. I will definitely buy this product again. * Really nice ,smooth sunscreen. Blends well with my skin with no white cast."
203,l'orÃ©al,bright reveal broad spectrum spf 50 daily uv,pimprod2040389,2613666," * This sunscreen pills once it dries down. It was really disappointed that it didn't have a smooth dry finish. I will not be buying again. * I really wanted to love this sunscreen, but I unfortunately, had a bad reaction to it.  It spread very easily and absorbed quickly, but a few hours later, my cheeks would turn bright red.  I stopped using it and started again and it would start.  It does blend very easily, so I think it's a shame it didn't work out for me. I know that the ingredients don't list anything that would have a strong alcoholic smell, but I thought the sunscreen smelled pretty strongly. * It's glowy and I'll give it that but I did not enjoy this sunscreen at all besides that. It has a strong sunscreen smell. It pills so bad. It also leaves a greasy feeling on me even in the winter time and I have combo/dry skin in the winter. * As a dark skin black woman I have struggled to find sunscreen that works for my skin. So glad I came across this holy grail. No white cast amd gives my skin a cute glow when worn alone. Perfect under makeup as well. This is the only sunscreen I will wear * I really wanted to love this sunscreen as I've heard great things about it both alone and under makeup. Unfortunately it never absorbs and pills terribly, under makeup and on its own. Leaves a whitecast as well. I returned it. * I decided to buy this sunscreen after reading the reviews and decided to give it a try. But I have nothing else to say except bad things about it. I have normal to dry skin, so I thought this would be a good fit for me since it's hydrating. However, it peels off instantly and don't even think to wear it under makeup. Plus, it leaves a white cast every time I apply it. I'm pale white. This is a big regret for me. * If you have olive undertones or tan skin in general this is not for you. The white cast is horrible and this sunscreen does not blend well at all. Made me extremely greasy and peely."
204,live tinted,hyperpigmentation essentials glow up set,pimprod2039104,2609978," * Ive been hearing more and more about this brand particularly the color corrector. I'm glad I got the to sample because i like uneben skin stick, ive been using it for abkjt three weeks and my dar spots on my face and chest ate fading, the tinyed moisturizer worh Spf 20 is ok, but i cant get behind the color corrector. Maybe I'm not patient, or care to take the time to really blend it. Its red, and if you dont take the time for it to set, then build with conceiler then its not going to look good. Im gonna stick with my other fave on that one! I will however, continue to use the dark spot stick! * The orange lip color looks awful. * Happy trial sizes exist of this product. Hyperpigmentation stick was good, glides and blends easily. However no match for my perimenopause dry skin. On anyone else would probably be a moisturizing glow. The SPF was great, blends in and gives a cc type of glow finish. * The tinted sunscreen does leave a slight cast, the color stick is perfect, and the hyperpigmentation serum needs better packaging because you have to dig out the product at end. Overall good value, but wont be purchasing full size items."
205,mad hippie,hydrating facial spf 25+,pimprod2025059,2581557," * I got this in a sample size & absolutely loved it. I'm oil prone & put it on in the morning - it's kept my face matte all day. Definitely need to get this in a full size. * My skin is fair and acne prone. This sunscreen has been working great so far. I actually have not noticed any new breakouts during the past couple of weeks I've been using this product. I even put it on my arm tattoos. The scent is pleasant, which is great because I hate the smell of sunscreen. Overall I think it's a great daily sunscreen for your face. * to start, spf 25 isnt even enough for your face or body no matter how much you use. I personally have combo skin with dry cheeks and an oily t zone, and this product dries me out! it sits TERRIBLY under makeup, and sweats off too easily. will not be re purchasing. * I bought the sunscreen because I've been on the hunt for a daily mineral 'clean ingredient' face SPF. I previously purchased the Mad Hippie face serum with spf and liked it, but saw this and there was more product for a similar price so I figured I'd give it a go. It is very light and blends easily for a mineral sunscreen, leaving a minimal cast (if at all). It has a very light, negligible scent. I don't wear daily makeup so I can't speak to layering it with other products, but I really like this sunscreen so far. * I didnt fond myself reaching for it a lot. Ive been trying to experiment with mineral sunscreens and while I think this did the job fine, it was very had to warm up in my hanfs out for me, and seemed greasy. 

I feel like this would be the ideal sunscreen for winter with ifs moisturizing properties, but not for summer, at least for me. * Even the smallest amount has left a white cast and flakes. I got a huge zit almost immediately after applying. Will be returning! * I love Mad Hippie but this is not my favorite product so far. It runs in clear but leaves your fingers feeling sticky afterwards."
206,zitsticka,megashade breakout-proof spf 50 serum,pimprod2025207,2584617," * I use this daily for my neck and chest. I am extremely break out prone and this is the one product that I can use daily ans not aggrivate any body acne. Its lightweight, yes hydrating and I dont mind the packaging. 
Its a little pricey but to know it wont break me out its worth the peace of mind! * Let me start off saying I live in AZ so sunscreen is a must, and I hardly ever buy the same product twice. This sunscreen has been repurchased 4 times now. It's perfect, its light weight feeling, hydrating, and I love the new packaging (even with the old dropper packaging, I hated that but the product was so good I continued to buy it, but the new pump is the best). It never makes my skin break out, I love that it's spf 50 as I wont use anything less than 40. Makeup goes on over it nicely, never had any issues with separation (skin is usually dry but sometimes oily nose area).
For people saying it's overpriced, I don't think it is. It has alot of skincare benefits besides sun protection, and if you have crazy sensitive skin that breaks out from almost everything (like I do) and you're on a clear skin journey, this is worth it. I'm a firm believer that if the product actually works then I will pay the price. I will continue to purchase this for as long as it's around, hopefully forever! * Ive tried countless sunscreens and this is my absolute favorite ever im obsessed. I have sensitive skin and this is the only one that works for me * Overpriced. * For the price, i expected much better quality. * I love this spf so much! Its lightweight and perfect if you are acne prone. Its leaves a dewy finish that can be set with powder if thats not your vibe. No whitecast on my pale skin is visible. It feels nice to apply! Doesnt smell awful or all. Ive gone through 3 bottles of this about to purchase my 4th. Its so good, try it at least once in your spf journey, i dont think youll be disappointed. * This sunscreen has changed my life! It is the only one that i have wanted to put on my face every single day! It has never made me break out and it makes makeup go on so smooth! Especially under the eyes! Please never stop making this! It is my holy grail sunscreen!!!!"
207,vichy,liftactiv peptide-c face sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2013305,2559388," * I am like that this has vitamin C and sunscreen. The lotion goes on easily, but it smells so bad. I will be returning it. * Does not leave white cast, wears good under makeup, I have been using for years now! * Terrible strong perfume scent that caused a rash - will be returning * It is light and smooth, not greasy. It will run into your eyes if you sweat. It has a strong fragrance like men's cologne. I don't know if it is a signature Vichy scent or what, but it is not a fragrance that plays well with others. * My skin is somewhat sensitive. Not many products, including sunscreen, break me out, but the ones that do, REALLY mess me up. This sunscreen broke me out terribly. Not all over the face, but a few cystic blemishes, including one of my nose. I'm still dealing with the scarring from that :( The scent on this is VERY strong. I am not sensitive to scents at all. I don't care when products are scented, but there is no need for it be this strongly scented. What were they thinking? 

I bought this during the beauty days sale so I will keep it and use it on my neck and chest for the anti-aging benefits, but if you are breakout prone from sunscreens, be very careful with this one. * My first time trying out this face sunscreen and it feels nothing like all the others I've tried and used under makeup! This is veil like, smooth application…. BUT!!! The scent! The scent is STRONG and it does not go away even after you applying foundation or bb cream… I really wanted to love this product because of the peptides but im disappointed I will not be using it as I wanted due to the smell. Side note the description does indicate there is a floral scent to it (i missed reading that part) I agree it is a floral scent except it is strong! * I like how this goes on and the potential benefits, however, it irritates my rosacea and makes me redder."
208,kopari beauty,antioxidant face shield mineral spf 30,pimprod2031646,2594644," * I was searching for a mineral face sunscreen that was cruelty free and made of clean ingredients.  This checked all the boxes and I was eager to try it when it arrived.

Unfortunately I cannot get past the smell.  To me it smells like stagnant water in a dirty pipe or cow trough.  When I've read reviews for products in the past where reviewers whine about the smell, I admit I usually roll my eyes…as how bad can it be?  Karma I suppose is teaching me a lesson.

As I truly can't stand the smell of my face, I was planning to return it.  However, as it would just be thrown away I will just use it up on my legs, where the smell doesn't immediately hit me.

Too bad, as it does give the skin a nice glow, didn't run in my eyes, and absorbed quickly.  I'll be going back to Coola's Classic Face Sunscreen lotion.  It's not mineral, but ticks all the other boxes…and no offense smell. * Frankly, I'm sick of these companies and their deceptive marketing. This is not a soley mineral based spf, look at the ingredients. Those sensitive to chemical filters, they're in here. As a licensed esti for 20+ years I encourage everyone to do their homework regarding ingredients. I've seen plenty of patients who think they're using 100% mineral, but end up having a dermatitis reaction because there are chemical filters in the INACTIVE ingredients section. There are plenty of websites & apps that will break down ingredients for you that you can easily understand what you're purchasing. Please know your skin and research. * This gave me no sun protection, skin rash and is not a true Mineral Sunscreen. It has butyloctyl salicylate  a UV filter Chemical. It burns my skin, eyes and neck. I do not recommend for sensitive or need a mineral sunscreen. what a waste of money. disappointed. * I use this sunscreen almost daily, I love that it's mineral based and has clean ingredients. It does have an odd light smell but I would rather deal with that than put something with a strong parfum/fragrance ingredient on my face. It makes my skin glowy and dewy which I love! * I really wanted to like this one, but it's not for me. It has an off putting smell and is greasy so your makeup slides off. Using sunscreen daily is the key to keeping skin young looking. To get the best protection I think the easiest and best is the mists or setting sprays like seriously fab zinc over. If sunscreen is greasy and smells bad, you're probably not gonna wanna do it every day. This one has a long list of chemicals no bueno. * I really wanted to like this but don't understand the hype. It smells terrible, like sand and playdough somehow at the same time. It's not glowy but greasy and doesn't ever dry down, making you feel sticky for hours. The greasiness means makeup also doesn't wear well on top. I tried it for a long time to give it a fair chance (about 1 month) and ended up throwing the rest away. Do not recommend. * This product has an odor that is so horrible, I had to wash my face after application."
209,vichy,capital soleil tinted face mineral sunscreen spf 60,pimprod2013306,2559390," * Butyloctyl Salicylate is a chemical UV filter, so why are you putting it in a mineral sunscreen? It gives horrible skin rash that sends you to ER. Please be honest about the chemical UV filters you are putting into sunscreens and cable them as active ingredients so buyers can be more informed. I do not recommend. It feels like I got a chemical burn from sunscreen. * Not my favorite sunscreen on the market but I like the fact that its SPF 60, bottle is small so travels well and consistency is fine. When I apply this with my hands, it leaves me with a like chalky/pale, no white, but pale skintone which you dont expect for a tinted product.  I prefer to apply with a makeup brush. The thing I dislike most is the smell, reminds me of sulfur, using a brush minimized that. Likely won't repurchase and will just use what I have left. * I really wanted to like this sunscreen. It dries down matte but it breaks me out everytime I use it. * I like to use mineral sunscreens because they don't sting my eyes, but this one stings my entire face. * It balls up, pills and comes off EVERY SINGLE TIME.
I shake it until the cows come home
I use just ONE moisturizer underneath it
I put it on NAKED skin

It PILLS, without fail * this is my new foundation. 2 in 1 for sure. I am going for a second bottle. * I've used heavy full coverage foundations for almost 20 years. I wanted to add sunscreen and skincare to my makeup. tried several tinted serums, sunscreens, moisturizers, but this one actually has some coverage and gives you a glow. I stopped wearing foundation completely now. this is my daily go to. if I need extra coverage I use a little concealer. I still do my smoky eye and it looks great"
210,first aid beauty,mineral sunscreen zinc oxide broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2032660,2593738," * I love this product so much! Ive been looking for a sunblock for years. I've tried blue lizard, cetaphil, la roche posay, it, elf, & supergoop. They've all irritated my skin. This is the first sunblock that has not irritated my face. I'm so glad i invested in it. The product is a little sticky, but i dont mind! * Sunscreen is something I've incorporated into my daily skin regimen since I was a tween. This sunscreen goes on sheer and has a subtle non bothering natural fragrance that makes application enjoyable. * I have very oily and acne prone skin, this product saved my skin. I have yet to break out. The bottle also lasts forever, I've had the same bottle for 6 months. Love this product, worth the price. * Recommend to those with sensitive skin as it's a mineral sunscreen. Zinc is good for acne and I didn't break out from this. I dont recommend this for those with darker skin as it may leave a white cast * Not sure how this has so many postive reviews. Its so sticky and tacky. I would not recomend this. * I just jeep coming back too it. I have combo sensative acne prone skin and its just unbeatable! * doesnt leave a white cast, didnt break me out, protexts my skin from the sun, sits well under makeup, feels like a moisturizer, dosesnt pill. this is the beat spf ive ever used and ive been looking for one for so long"
211,kiehl's since 1851,super fluid daily uv defense spf 50+,pimprod2002969,2536726," * Its a little oily. I just applied it (cause i already bought it no point in throwing it away) and theres residue all over my phone now. It also leaves a white cast on the skin. Im fairly light skinned for a hispanic and it still looks like i applied a white powder after rubbing it in. Lastly it is VERY runny so make sure to close the cap properly after use. I made that mistake and some of it spilled in my bag. But it works! * I have greasy, combo, acne prone, olive toned skin and now use this every day. It feels really great on the skin and does not clog my pores. * It is second time to me to use it because I love it and it's perfect on my skin!! * when it comes to sunblock I want to cringe at the price but it works SO WELL and my skin doesn't break out AT ALL when using this.
I know I'll be rebuying it once I run out. * Again - poorly packaged; leaked all over the very small bottle.  Over priced for the amount. * Don't like this product. If u sweat it will burn and irritate your eyes. * I have several Kiehl's products, I am in love with this brand and have the best skin I've had in a long time. Some things I deal w/ are being acne-prone, oily, rosacea and very sensitive. I've been doing some research on rosacea and have read that wearing a daily SPF can help with redness (among many other benefits, of course). I wanted to make sure I was getting a product from a brand I believe in because face sunscreen has been tricky for me. It's usually greasy and breaks me out significantly. I spent the extra money for this product and am unfortunately not very pleased. Like other comments, this product does ball up on the face. I find that I have to let my daily moisturizer sink in for AT LEAST 10 minutes before I can put on my sunscreen. And the more you try to massage it into the face, the more it will ball up. Other than that, my MAJOR complaint about this product is that after applying and about an hour after it's on my face, my skin starts to burn. It feels as though I have a mild sunburn across my entire face where you can feel the discomfort and burn. Again, I have sensitive skin and apparently it's just not reacting well with me. I've gone a few days without it and then tried it again and it is 100% this sunscreen. I'm out side of my return time so I'm stuck with it and really disappointed. I hate having to purchase products to figure out what works for my skin. Just writing this in-depth review for those of you with the same kind of skin as me...just to think twice. I will say, it does eventually sink into my skin and does not leave it greasy so that's a positive."
212,clinique,broad spectrum spf 50 sunscreen body cream,pimprod2037471,2604492," * I have gone on outdoors and swimming. It never disappoints when it's body protection. Against let's say, Neutrogena spray-on SPF, I got sunburned on the areas where I used the latter one, and the Clinique SPF protected areas remained unharmed."
213,australian gold,botanical tinted face sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2012275,2615515," * I liked this, it went on great, flet good, and dried matte which was great for me cause im a oily girly but as a black woman it does leave a heavy white cast, like black makeup in the 90's/ casket ready type of white cast which is a no no for me, and it was obvious if i didnt rub it into my hair line which is why the rating is so low. So unless you like that kind of look I wouldn't suggest it for my brown and black girl, boys, gays or theys. * Such a nice sheer tint, blends easily. definitely get this!!!! * My skin is sensitive and acne-prone so it's oftentimes challenging for me to find an spf that works. I absolutely love this spf tint - it looks natural on my skin, doesn't break me out, and it provides good sun protection. Please bring back all three shades of this! I miss being able to purchase it from here * Im a chemical sunscreen girl, but I kept seeing this sunscreen on social media so I decided go give it a try. 

PROS: 
- whipped texture 
- neutral tones 
- matte finish 
- absorbs oil
- good around the eye area 
- great for oily skin and/or summer
- 50+ SPF
- great for an active lifestyle

CONS: 
- feels a little heavy until it sets 

I do two layers of sunscreen: first a chemical sunscreen and then a mineral sunscreen. This is the best mineral sunscreen I've tried (Neutrogena, Cerave, MDSolarSciences, DMTLGY). * It's REALLY good, just not for someone with dry skin. I do like the texture, coverage, natural looking color, and the overall matte apperance but after 30 minutes it dries me out so bad. It would be good for humid days/someone with ""normal"" skin. * Over all good but very prone to rub off on clothing. Can't use near v neck and don't pull a top over your head. * The title says it all.  I purchased this, very excited to have found a sunscreen that is spf 50 and tinted AND acne safe.  Read some reviews saying it was not good at all, etc, great for oily skin.  This is why I was happily surpised that on my fair, dry skin it felt and looked great.  It was a little bit dark for my skin but it just made me look bronzed there wasn't any harshness or orange.  And it felt good on my skin under makeup (concealer and powder) all day.  Very suprised it also did not transfer.  Overall great product but I am suspicious of how it is spf 50 when the active ingredients do not indicate this at all."
214,dime,wonderscreen broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2035158,2603227," * It is creamy, has not strong scent, little bit goes long way and protects well without alluminum or other junk * I would have given 5 stars, but I am having to open the bottle and scrape the sides and use the inside tube to get the product out. The pump doesn't work. I would buy this product again in a heartbeat, if they changed the packaging. * I have truly enjoyed Dime's other products and had hoped that the sunscreen would work as well as the rest of the line. I was instead disappointed with the sunscreen.  The texture was smooth, no string smells, but it refused to blend into my skin.  I have tried numerous times but ended up looking like a vanilla frosted donut face.  Or worse, when I thought it was blended only to see my reflection later and see the white cast. * I am quite disappointed with this product. It is very expensive and I expected more from it. Also reviews from other people somehow made me think this would be some kind of holy grail. I have rosacea and red bumps on my skin. On the very first day I applied this to my face, I noticed that the skin started to flake and become drier than ever, as well as a tingling sensation. Maybe I just can't tolerate the mineral sunscreens, I'm not sure, but I expected more for this price. * Does what is supposed to, but the white cast is insane! Feels super heavy and oily on my dry skin and it peels when appliyng makeup. * It is now 2024 and we still have physical sunscreens that give darker skin women a white cast. The 12 dollar Neutrogena sunscreen will give you the same results. Save your money. * Another physical sunscreen that pictures black women but then isn't inclusive. It still gives whitecast on brown skin. Disappointed."
215,black girl sunscreen,kids spray & play spf 50 sunscreen,pimprod2038242,2609780," * I absolutely love this product, whenever i start to run low on product i go and get two more bottles lol. Love the spf 50, leaves my skin shiny and glistening, and easy to apply. * This product has a strong odor which I really don't like. No white cast though. I prefer the BGS kids version and probably won't purchase this again. * The sunscreen itself isnt bad but it only lasted me two days. * I wanted to love this more. When I sprayed it on my face, the product seeped into my eyes and burned the rest of the night. If I spray it on my hands and apply it that way, I love how it sits on my skin. Nice glow but heavy fragrance."
216,avÃ¨ne,mineral sunscreen broad spectrum spf 50 face and body lotion,pimprod2039988,2611198," * I was hoping this sunscreen would work out for me since it appears to be marketed towards people with sensitive skin but I applied it heavily and still got a terrible sunburn. My skin looked burgundy. It was as if I had nothing on at all. Not only is it ineffective, but it's also increadibly greasy and sticky and pleasant to touch where applied. * Avene is the best. So gentle and moisturizing on your skin. I have a number of their products and this does not disappoint. In fact I prefer this on my face as it gives me a dewy glow and feels great. There is no smell and a small amount goes a long way. Rub it in and the zinc disappears leaving you with a youthful appearance. 
Spent the whole day at a concert and this Norwegian gal did not get burnt! * This sunscreen was greasy, grainy and left a white streaky finish. Disgusting! * I love this! For a completely mineral sunscreen with no tint, I'm super impressed. This is a great moisturizer and can totally be used as a single step. It does have a waxy sort of smell to it when you first apply but it doesn't linger- if you're someone who has to use all fragrance-free products because of eczema you probably already know exactly whatp I'm talking about. But again, the smell doesn't linger, it completely disappears.

There is also a pretty strong white cast when you first apply, but after rubbing it in well and waiting for it to absorb (you should be waiting ~20 mins after applying sunscreen before you go outside anyway!) it completely disappears on my brown skin. (I'm about the skin tone of Parveen Kaur for reference lol.) I only use it on my body though, for two reasons: 1) I prefer tinted minerals on my face to help with hyperpigmentation, and 2) white casts are always more noticeable on the face in my opinion. But if I try it on my face I will report back!

Overall, I find this super moisturizing and great for winter dryness and/or eczema prone skin. I like to apply it on my arms and legs, even in the winter when I'm covered up. Feels thick and soothing and leaves my skin soft. If you like a lightweight sunscreen that doesn't feel like body lotion, this is NOT for you. Especially in a humid climate, this might be too much. I also can't speak to the white cast for someone with a deeper skintone than mine. But for my skin type (brown, dry and sensitive, lifelong eczema, braving the new england winter😭), I really love this! * I am not one who is harsh on products and always give them the benefit of the doubt, but this one had an overpowering smell! I do not mind a heavy fragrance but this one was not pleasant. I would absolutely purchase again if there was a way to tone down those scents some! I did some reasearch and some people mentioned that it may be a scent from the minerals causing a weird smell rather than adding fragrance which can cause a reaction in some people. Who knows, but I do know I hold my breath everytime I put it on! :( * This has the least amount of whitecast of any mineral sunscreen ive tried and is one of the highest SPFs I have seen. The smell is not pleasent. But it goes away after a bit. I have asked my bf and he cannot smell it on my skin after the inital application. * This sunscreen is too white, has a scent to it its not bad but not for me im sure theres better sunscreens"
217,bliss,block star sheer liquid daily sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2038458,2607974," * this formula is now my new favorite.  I love their tube tinted version in spf30, but this one knocks it out of the park.  it is runny, smooth, not greasy, blends well.  it's everything I. looking for in a sunscreen including the 20% zinc! * This is one of my favorite sunscreens, I'm very fair and the white cast really evens out my skin, it looks like I am wearing a tinted moisturizer. If you're super pale and in the market for a tinted moisturizer or sunscreen, I cannot recommend this enough! * I'm actually a fan of other Bliss products, but I have never experienced a whiter cast from sunscreen in my life. I could tell it would have one as it came out of the bottle, but wanted to trust the ""sheer"" claims. Will be returning. * I really like the light weight feel of this sunscreen, espeically for a mineral one. Although I find it pills under makeup and can cling to dry spots. So best for a no makeup day. * Iv tried a lot of sunscreens and I mean alot . Every single sunscreen I have used breaks me out even mineral ones. This sunscreen is by far the best one iv ever used its just amazing . * This sunscreen is so good. I've tried so many sunscreens and this one has everything I want. It actually absorbs, no white cast, it doesn't get into my eyes, and it's recyclable. * I need to stick to mineral sunscreens for my skin, so it's been hard for me to find one that leaves a minimal white cast, has high SPF, and is water-resistant. I just finished my first bottle of this, and so far I think it's one of the better ones I've tried! It doesn't irritate my skin, blends impressively for SPF 50, and doesn't feel heavy at all.

I have tan skin, so I usually wear a BB cream over this to cancel out the slight white cast this leaves. Note that it's a high SPF, untinted *mineral* sunscteen, so I cannot expect it to be fully clear. 

The one downside is that this seems to turn white in areas that get wet or have a lot of friction, such as under the bridge of your glasses. It can be rubbed back in very easily, but that's something to note."
218,mad hippie,luminizing facial spf 29,pimprod2030862,2592480," * One of the worst sunscreens I have used. It leaves a very heavy greasy feeling on your face and good luck if it gets into your eyes! They will burn and itch for hours. I love their serums but not this. Will be returning asap. * love this sunscreen, my only ick with it is that if i wear makeup over this it tends to make it peel :(. i usually use another spf bb cream as my foundation over this, so maybe ill just try their tinted foundations instead. * I was excited about this susncreen because I use other Mad Hippie products. However, I only used it for a week as I noticed my skin became super dry while I was using this and my pores were so clogged even when I exfoliated. I also started getting little bumps on my face and redness. There was also residue when I applied makeup on top. * I like this SPF a lot. You do need to rub it in quite a bit, but I like the glowy effect and that it has clean ingredients. I definitely recommend! * It's lightweight, not greasy, dries quickly and looks great. I love the ingredients and price :) * Not one to go out of my way to write a bad review but this product caused some kind of allergic reaction. Used it just once and started itching on neck. Spread to a rash everywhere I put product. Still dealing with eczema leather skin type of rash * I like how it feels on the skin but it dries down very quickly which means that you cannot put it on in sections, you have to apply to your whole face at the same time or it will pill on the face which is annoying"

It's lightweight and not greasy and definitely gives u a cute glow. * so far so good. * I tried this sunscreen on a whim since I'm already such a fan of this brand and I'm SO pleased! My husband and I used this for the first time for a full day of walking around the zoo and we only had to reapply twice. No burns/pinkness and no residue. * I am obsessed with this sunscreen to say the absolute least! I honestly use it every day as a body lotion because it gives the most beautiful shine without being greasy. It makes my skin look so healthy. It, of course, also serves its purpose as a sunscreen. Please please PLEASE never discontinue this!!! * I love this stuff. It smells great and it works very well. But as an outdoor concert girlie, I'm begging for a miniature version so I can carry it in a small bag"

So I do like it for that. But the chemical scent is so strong, If even put the product up to my face, my eyes sting and water. It also pills into little balls when your rub it in. I havne't gotten burned when I wear it so it does protect my skin- & I'm finishing the bottle because I don't want to waste it. But I would not buy it again. * Feels and smells like a sanitizer. 
Not comfortable puting this on my littles ones. * This stuff has a very strong alcohol smell and mixed with the banana it's almost too much. That being said, I really like how this applies on wet skin. Will continue to use for reapplication purposes only"

222,dune suncare,the mineral melt broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2039397,2609322," * this is genuinely terrible. to start off, if you use the recommended amount on sunscreen with this product, it will leave a horrible white cast that makes you look sickly pale. then it will pill all over, making it useless under makeup. it broke me out too. lastly, it smelled TERRIBLE. it smells like sweet vanilla in the bottle, but once it oxidizes it produces this horrible stench and its all over your face. this product has no pros, only cons, and i'm BEGGING you to NOT purchase this product. i will be throwing mine away promptly * I bought this sunscreen because I heard it doesn't cause a white cast, it did. It also didn't want to blend into my skin 100%, peeled off away from my face (bare) in flakes. I looked like I had white eraser dust on my face. Same thing for my friend. * I have tried sooo many mineral sunscreens and they end up either having a white cast, feel heavy and gross, look too oily, or dry out my already dry skin. I am allergic to chemical sunscreen so im limited on what I can use. Let me just tell you … this sunscreen is IT. It is so lightweight and feels like i am just putting on a lightweight moisturizer. It absorbs fast and the finish looks ""natural"" and not dewy or shiny. No white cast, rubs in easily, and wears well under makeup. I run outside in the sun for 2 + hrs and never get burnt. Cant say enough good things about this sunscreen. * Look - this pills.  I really was hoping this would be a great, sheer, water resistant, mineral option for the summer.  However, if you use more than a smidge, this pills.  I tried on bare skin, over just a toner, under my full normal morning skin routine and it pills on application.  The texture is nice and not drying, and the cast is minimal, but present,  in comparison to many other mineral sunscreens.  I am aggressively neutral on the smell, its a little sunscreen-y, but it doesnt bother me.. Its neither strong, nor long lasting.  Also, its not a great amount.  I plan to use this up on my hands and ears. * I have mixed feelings about this sunscreen. One the one hand it dries down quickly and isnt sticky which I really appreicate. On the other hand it pills around my chin, neck, and eyebrows…which isnt the worst thing but is a little annoying. I mostly use this sunscreen on days where I need to run out of the house and need something that dries down quickly. * I love this sunscreen! As the name suggests it is very sheer and leaves my skin feeling moisturized without feeling sticky or greasy (a big ask for my oily skin). I will say, it does pill up under makeup if you start immediately after applying, but I give it 10 minutes or so and you should have no problem! * I used to use Biossance squalane mineral sunscreen until people started having reactions and it was pulled off the market. In my search for a comparable sunscreen, I found this one and honestly I think I like it even more! Feels very lightweight and moisturizing and blends in well! I like the glow it gives but I don't think it makes me look oily (I have combo-dry skin).My only wish is if they could make an SPF 50+ version!"

Liking the bod guard. The face one stays a bit too tacky for me. * Product itself upon patch testing felt nice. However, I was surprised to see that the sunscreens expire in less than two months. I placed my order June 2025 and the product is set to expire July 2025. Other reviews in 2023 showed pictures of the products expiring in 2025. Disappointed and will be returning. * Really wanted to like these. They go on smooth but them almost immediately start pilling. They do not play well with makeup, even a BB cream."

This SPF never blends seamlessly into my skin becsuse it is so thick and sticky. It pills super easily around my hairline for some reason which then leaves a bunch of flakes around my baby hairs. I really wanted to like this but im just using it up to not be wasteful at this point. Ive been using it since December and I've not had any luck in getting it to work for me. * Nothinggggg I saw on the bottle or on the packaging (at least easily visible) said this was tinted. It's way too dark for me so I've wasted the money now. I love Pacifica but this was very disappointing. * I bought this with high hopes because I love Pacifica products. I will not purchase again. this is so thick and sticky I can't bring myself to use it. It absorbs almost too quickly, is hard to blend and so thick I couldn't wait to wash my hands after using it. I've tried shaking it to mix it (it does tell you to shake well) but nothing moves in the bottle when you shake it. The only nice thing about it is the bottle. * You have changes the recipe?!?!? 
Its not the same. I used to love this product. 
Now its just ok  - it is sticky. 
Will not but again. * Tried this product bc it was on sale. For a zinc oxide mineral based SPF, this tinted moisturizer feels very light on the face. Not as light as a chemical SPF moisturizer such as a Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, but it's a mineral SPF so it sits as a physical UV barrier like mineral sunscreen does. 

No white cast with this mineral SPF bc it's lightly tinted. I was surprised as others bc it's not apparent on the packaging except for one small info graphic on the side that it's tinted. But I imagine that's how they got around it having a white cast residue. I have extremely light skin with reddish hair and using two pea-sized product amount left no discernible cast once it soaked in over a few minutes. 

The scent is akin to bubblegum or cotton candy but thankfully does not last once it's dried. I really like that it's a light weight mineral tinted moisturizer, but simply based on the overly sweet scent I probably won't buy this product again. I need a mid30s formulation of this product not the teens formulation this product feels like it's geared towards :P * I had no idea it was tinted. Nothing (at least prominent) on the packaging that indicates it's tinted. When I squeezed it out, it's orange. Looks absolutely terrible. Not a glowy tan. Rather the color of a former POTUS. * I didn't like the consistency or tint"

I loved the texture and the way it felt on my skin, but unfortunately 3 days later I broke out in a rash on my neck and chest. It was the only new product I had introduced. Maybe some people can tolerate it on their skin but not mine. * *I was gifted by Supergoop to review* My skin is typically combination, however my biggest concern with sunscreens is 1. Being good with sensitive skin and 2. Having little to no white cast since I have tan skin. To my surprise, there was ZERO white cast, and the lotion is completely white so it went into my skin nicely and left it pretty soft. I would recommend! * I love it. I put it on everyday. It doesn't make my face look oily even if I apply makeup on top. It's a great product that last for hours. I highly recommend this product. I received this product complimentary from Supergoop. * My skin is super itchy now. * Leaves a white cast. I will use the rest of it since it wasnt cheap but if you have medium to dark skin this might not be the sunscreen for you * My daughter love the super goop SPF 30 lotion it doesn't give a white residue. The whole family use it to. * I occasionally use it as a base for my make up and usually the first thing in the morning. If you don't set it with powder, it can get kind of greasy but otherwise it doesn't clog pores or make me break out."

Goes on very smoothly, not shiny, not too thick, does not make my face look white. It blends in very nicely and has even helped reduce the redness on my face. Love it obsessed need more. * couldn't even try this product to see if it was any good because the pump wouldn't dispense any product and it was extremely annoying to try to scoop out the sunscreen with my finger. * This is the one sunscreen that doesn't break me out and it doesn't have a weird smell. I love that it has a pump but only 1 out of the 3 bottles I had gotten had a working pump. The tubing of the pump is too long and kinks up in the container, and I have to scoop it out with my fingers. It sounds like the defective pump is a big issue for many of us. Please fix this Earth Harbor! 

Nerding out-Many sunscreens claim SPF 30- each 1% zinc oxide = 1.6 SPF units. With 18.8% zinc oxide, this is truely SPF 30, protecting against 97% of UVB rays.

I will stay a loyal customer as long as they fix the pump issue 😊 * burns and itches my skin. pump doesn't work. * the sunscreen itself is fine but the pump on mine doesn't work so i have to scoop it out with my finger * Unfortunately, like others have said, I couldn't get the pump to even get any of the product out. I tried multiple times, thinking the product just had to work its way up the pump but, when I opened it, the tube for the pump was so bent around and around that there was no way the product could have made its way up. Additionally, the product is SO thick that I'm not sure how it even could have fit through the tiny tubing. Instead of scooping it all out, I'm planning to return. * Left my face feeling kind of greasy, but the biggest issue is how jacked the bottle is. When I opened it, I couldn't get the pump to work, and removed it to see if I could get it working. The tube leading from the pump into the bottle was bent into a zig-zag, rendering the pump completely useless. Now I have to scoop it out and use the bent tube like a tiny spatula. The moisturizer itself isn't anything special. Not sure I would buy again, especially if they're not cautious during the packing process to make sure the pump will actually work."

I tried this out because I like spray sunscreens and the mousse texture intrigued me. This product did not disappoint! I love how it goes on without leaving any white cast or streaks as it rubs in really beautifully. It's super lightweight to the point you forget you're wearing sunscreen. The mousse texture is so silky and nice. Oh, and it smells nice too! Not too strong and the scent goes away after a little while, but it's very pleasant when you first apply it. It's sort of an aloe-y scent, if that makes sense. I can't speak much for how well it protects against the sun because I don't spend too much time outside, but it's great to have on just for everyday sun exposure. Haven't had any burns with it, so that's good! * It is so fun to apply! Instead of spray it is like wipped cream. It makes it fun to apply * Honestly I was skeptical about this, purchased it for my 9 year old son but was in a pinch and needed to use it myself. It goes on well, and does not remain sticky. * literally most amazing sunscreen ever. smells so great, makes my legs look so moisturized and glowy without being too sticky. 10/10 recommend. * It goes on easily, but not much easier than the traditional kind. It seems expensive for the amount, and worst of all, I really hated the smell. * Honestly my go to sunscreen! Leaves no white-cast, has natural ingredients, makes me glowy, and has such a great smell. I prefer this sunscreen than supergoop's other collections. I feel like the squeeze bottle one makes my skin too oily and slight break outs. * I'm so happy I stumbled upon my new go-to. Its consistency is what initially captivated me. The mousse texture makes application so fun lol. It has a lightweight feel so it effortlessly glides onto my skin. It dries quickly, providing a glowy finish and NO WHITE CAST! Doesn't feel heavy or greasy. Even after using it for a while, I'm impressed by how much product is still left in the bottle."
230,aveeno,calm + restore daily moisturizer mineral sunscreen with broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2041300,2615484," * I really wanted to like this product but it just pills so much on the skin. The product lays in creases on the face (think wrinkles and eye creases). It has no white caste, which is great. But it is horrible to blend. * Although the color is nice and does not leave a white cast, I immediately had issues with pilling and would not recommend the product because of that. * I find that this product is not moisturizing enough to be labeled as a ""daily mosturizer"". It would be great as an SPF for those who have oily skin, as it gives a smooth matte finish. On my dry skin, it sticks to my dry patches and looks terrible. Even over other moisturizers I am not getting a smooth finish. Just beware if you have dry skin! * It is so hard to distribute on the skin and then leaves a horrible cast. The package said over 80% of users agreed it matched their skin tone which I am assuming was tested on people with white skin. Package is very misleading, do not buy. * This balls and pills so badly even when used alone. Gets worse throughout the day. Do not buy. * Need a mineral sunscreen since skin has been sensitized by tret use, i know physical formulas will never be as cosmetically elegant as chemical, this product is the worst i've ever tried. Separates horribly, clumps on my lips and hairline, strong white cast. * I religiously used the original Ultra Calming moisturizer from Aveeno for over 20 years.  That moisturizer was perfect- amazing texture, good pump packaging, and most importantly it was 100% effective at keeping my redness at bay.
This stuff (which is essentially their replacement to that one) is  garbage.  It's tinted (why?), it has a sticky texture which makes it difficult to blend in, and the packaging is cheap.   On top of all that, it actually has made my redness worse.  Oh!  And it has HALF the amount of the product as the Ultra Calming moisturizer- for a higher price.   Corporate greed trickling down to the consumer does not go unnoticed.  Johnson & Johnson majorly dropped the ball with this new ""Calm and Restore"" line."

It is so moisturizing and feels so good on the skin, never too greasy. I sometimes wear skin tints over top and never get any pilling. It layers well for reapplication, though I have noticed that after putting it on for a third application it doesn't feel quite as smooth and gets a little sticky, but if you're only reapplying once or twice, I think it's fantastic. * Ive been buying this sunscreen for two years now.

I noticed my skin felt way smoother after using as well. I love it and will for sure buy again. * This is my favorite sunscreen. I buy it over and over again. I'm very pale so I can't speak about white cast, but it's not a mineral sunscreen so that shouldn't be a huge problem. It is very hydrating but not oily. It feels like I've just put on a nice moisturizer. It also reapplies very well. It never pills on top of itself. I don't wear foundation so I don't know about wearing it under anything but it does look good under a skin tint or concealer. * Tried this out for a humid, 100 degree full sun TX vacation. It never stung my eyes! It leaves a shine, but is comfortable to wear and less greasy than any others I've tried. Effective, comfortable, I'm sold!"

Leaves the skin feeling rough * this smells so bad and leaves a white cast. * I tried it and it would cause a reaction withbother products. Then it begab to itch. I stopped for a  month and tried it again and once again cause a reaction my skin is red and itchy and hot * Super moisturizing, smell is a 7/10, does not look cakey. Definitely recommend!! * I applied and reapplied as directed, but I still got a sunburn. I thought I was being responsible by upgrading to a more ""grown up"" sunscreen. I was WRONG. I've used cheap Hawaiian tropic 15 SPF sunscreen with bronzer for years, and I never should've cheated with Supergoop. Just as nice weather has arrived, I have sun marks that probably won't go away.

It actually feels good on your skin and works like a primer so makeup goes on smooth. Elated I finally found suncreen I actually want to wear! The tube is a little funky but a gentle squeeze as you pump the top and you're good to go. * I've tried pretty much every mineral sunscreen on the market, only to absolutely hate the way it feels and looks on my skin or it burns my sensitive eyes.... BUT this one checks all the boxes!  It doesn't leave a white cast, doesn't feel heavy or burn your eyes and actually feels really nice on the skin, plus leaves a smooth canvas for makeup.  Highly recommend and as long as they continue to make it, I will continue to use this sunscreen product exclusively. * I ordered two tubes (it was on sale!) and the pump on both tubes was defective. I could not get the product out of the tube to try it. I tried many different ways (short of cutting the tube open). I am so disappointed. * The product is fine. The packaging is horrible. No matter how much I pump, nothing comes out. The only way is to get any product is to squeeze the bottle and pump at the same time. * I initally bought this sunscreen because I had a few moles on my face surgically removed, my dermatologist gave me a gel to clear up the scars but it hadn't worked the way I hoped after a few months. My incision sight was still pretty deep and uneven. After only a week of applying this sunscreen both on my face and directly to my scars they faded even more than they previously had with the prescribed gel!!! It works wonders!! Both for general scars and also acne scars or pigmentation. Swear it always clears them up for me overnight. A little goes a long wayyyy. It's also the perfect size for traveling and on the go application. My skin is super soft after too, there are no cons to it. I love it! * Its okay, personally think there is a smell to it and i think its a little strong and i do not like it. It also pills and doesnt feel like my skin really absorbs it. Will finish the bottle but wont repurchase. * I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I bought this several months ago and I gave it a good shot but I can not believe so many people love this.
It's grainy, leaves a horrible white cast even on my very fair skin and just sits on the skin wrong. It doesn't sink in and dries and flakes and leaves white residue all over my clothes and eyebrows and somehow also is horribly greasy all day, and I have no idea why but no matter what I do it spreads and ends up in my eyes after about an hour after applying and it HURTS."

It smells nice, protects, hydrates and its great for people with eczema. I'm no doctor but my kids and I have horrible eczema and this does not burn our skin like other sunscreens. It also works beautifully that we don't burn as fast. Hands down the only sunscreen we take go the beach. * I love it so much I have been using for years!! I love how it makes my skin glowy. I have dry ans slightly oily skin it does not make my skin just hydrated, You must shake the bottle everytime you use it just a heads up. ( I have seen reviews about ""it's oily or it separates"" you have to shake it common sense) but anyways LOVE LOVE 10/10 * I have been using thos sunscreen for a long time. I love it so much. It makes my skin so glowy. * This is very oily sunscreen, it's almost shimmery. It made my face so greasy. This is sunscreen is fine for body use, but I don't recommend it for your face. * I bought the travel size version of this  lotion two weeks ago to take with me on a trip. I've always heard really good things about this brand, and thought I'd give it a try, but unfortunately it's just not for me. I felt like the texture of this product was sticky even after drying and left my face feeling very greasy. I have rosacea and my skin tends to be very reactive to new products. I was hoping this would be different, but it did make my entire face break out pretty badly. The fragrance is much heavier than I would like from a facial sunscreen. The sun protection factor was great, and I will continue to use the rest of the product on my chest/hands/body. If you have dry skin and don't have sensitivity issues like I do, this probably is a great product. * I absolutely love this product!!! Ive been using it for years and its the only thing that doesnt make me get sun burns. I will say its a bit on the oily side but if you plan on tanning or just laying by the pool i dont see a big deal in looking a bit oily . It blends so well with my skin tone i will be buying again * As always, loveee shisiedo sunscreens. This is just like the original, but hey the more SPF, the better. No white cast, no break outs, and my makeup never pills while using this. I see sometimes people worry about wateriness, but that's only happened to me if my bottle was in my bag on a hot day or I forgot to shake it well before squeezing some out."
235,buttah skin,tinted mineral sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2029216,2590116," * It blends in pretty nicely if you apply a few drops. If you actually apply enough to achieve protection there's a ghostly cast and if you keep rubbing it pills. I hope they rework the formula because thier other products I've tried are amazing. * Blends well. Doesn't crease. Feels moisturizing. The only problem is the color. very warm. May not be good for fair skin.  And the tint will oxidized as it dries. * It doesn't create a cast and is a perfect match for my skin but at the price paid, the packaging is terrible. The product comes out at the seam on the side where the label stops. * As a Latina with brown oily skin type  that likes to try new mineral sunscreens for people of color would totally recommend this sunscreen under makeup. Did not have any issues with pilling and wore beautifully under my matte foundations! * This is a very good sunscreen, but I think they need to take it back to the lab and tweak the formula as it flakes and pills by midday. Because of this, you cannot wear it under foundation otherwise you'll have a big mess on your face. I've been using it for about a year now but I'm currently looking for another brand. I will revisit this product in the future if they ever improve the formula.

Excellent mineral based SPF
Matches my skin perfectly
No white cast
Dries down into a beautiful dewy finish
POC owned
Great price! * I purchased this item when it first came out, and I was very excited to support a black owned brand and have another option for a mineral sunscreen that wouldn't look crazy on darker skin. It does blend in very well, although it still has a slight light cast as any mineral sunscreen is going to. However, I noticed that it would pill throughout the day. I tend to unconsciously rub my face throughout the day, and I would get little bits of sunscreen on my hands. I tried using other products underneath thinking my vitamin c or my moisturizer was the issue, but no matter what combination it always pilled. * I have dry skin and really wanted to try this out but I didn't know it gave a matte finish so I follow it up with a water resistant sunscreen from black girl sunscreen."
236,shiseido,urban environment oil-free mineral sunscreen spf 42,pimprod2038381,2606930," * I received this as part of my sample pack & finally decided to give it a try at the beach & poolside.

I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't cause my skin to breakout & it really stood up to the sun.  I was able to achieve a nice tan, while wearing sunglasses, but didn't get the raccoon eyes.

I normally wear the tinted sunscreens that are just as expensive, but they actually feel greaser & cause my skin to breakout.  I don't mind the shiny look as long as my face doesn't feel greasy.  In fact, it goes on rather light.

I'm going to try tge vitamin c one next.  But am definitely sold on this one. * This has been my go to sunscreen option for years now.
It's light. 
It doesn't irritate the eyes.
It doesn't have any weird smell that sometimes sunscreen has.

I love adding a super watery cream underneath it, 
cz indeed is a bit dry on the skin. * I've recently discovered that this mineral sun screen pairs perfectly with Bare Minerals makeup! So much better than using a primer! Be sure to wash your face and moisturize prior to applying the sun screen and makeup. It really helps to keep your skin from feeling dry. 

The consistency is very liquidy. It doesnt feel sticky. Although it does leave a white cast when worn alone so I avoid doing so. Instead, I apply the Shiseido stick sun screen when im bare faced. I havent experienced any eye irritations with this."

Went out to the pool in this super hot weather and realized this was the perfect opportunity to test out the sunscreen. The sunscreen is smooth and not tacky when being applied to the skin. It does not leave that nasty white residue that most of other known sunscreens leave. The product smells so good that I am able to utilize it on a daily basis when going out! Highly recommend! * If you love sweet and fruity sents- this is it. It smells like a fruity drink from your favorite pool bar. It has a sheen/glowy finish without glitter! I am a distance runner and it is sweat proof and I have yet to get a sunburn! Overall my favorite sunscreen i have ever used. My only complaint it is does get a tad greasy- I wouldnt say it is terrible, but i dont mind greasy when im running! * This is so lush and smells heavenly. I loved using this before going outside in my walks knowing my skin smelled amazing and was protected

I tried it again the next day cause I thought it was a cute sunscreen, and then I saw it gathering in my creases on my arms and not my face it just pours off. * I bought this and any amount I use leaves a very bad white case and I'm on the lighter side already. I can't imagine how bad it would be for anyone with a medium to dark complextion.

It also left a noticeably tacky film on top of my skin, it might be okay to use under makeup but not on its own. * Good texture but leaves a white cast * So far so good, I've only used for a week, it absorbs quickly, it's not oily, still haven't noticed any brightening but I probably need to give it time * its perfect lightweight GREAT FOR YOUR SKIN my skin glows after this and is poreless and tight i love it * I am a fan of Derma-E products, but this item indicated on the packaging that it was light weight and it is very thick and does not absorb nicely * This moisturizer doesn't clog my pores or break me out. I do feel like the vitamin c has lightened my dark spots. Rating it 4 stars because It does leave a white cast. I have fair skin and it does sink in, but it could be an issue on darker skin."
239,strivectin,anti-wrinkle glowfector spf 30,pimprod2036307,2603503," * I like this SPF. BUT it needs to be 2.5 time the amount for the price. Following the directions I apply generously to face and neck, but didn't re-apply every 2 hours--just once more in the middle of the day on no makeup days. The tube lasted less than 2 weeks using it this way. WAY too spendy * I received this product as a sample initially, and I will say that I hesitated to try it because I usually only use products labeled ""clean"" and ""cruelty-free"" and this is neither of those. Additionally, this moisturizer has a slight fragrance which would usually disqualify it from my regimen but I got hooked on the scent and the effect. I had 2 small wrinkles between my eyebrows and after using this, they're gone. I use this over my serums and facial creams and I'll buy this again and again. * I love the moisturizing, glowy feeling of the product with SPF! Perfect for daily use. * I don't ever leave reviews bit hos product is amazing! I have worked for dermatology offices for years and have been fortunate to try many different sunscreen products but this one may be my favorite ever! It's not sticky, goes on smooth and leaves a beautiful glow and looks so natural! * This product goes on very heavy and greasy so I was already nervous.  I headed out on a hike and six miles in, it started melting and oozing into my eyes.  There was nothing I could do at that point. Worst sunscreen ever. Buy Goop Unseen Sunscreen. * Best SPF ever. I love the glowy finish and it even works under my makeup. * I tried this in store while shopping and immediately fell in love, I've been using it for 2 weeks now. The glow that it gives my skin is beautiful, it also does not leave a white cast nor feels like a traditional SPF. I even tried it under makeup and it made everything look dewier and smoother. I highly recommend!"
240,sun bum,mineral lotion spf 30,pimprod2021610,2575600," * I love Sun Bum products and really wanted to love this. I was looking for a high SPF mineral formula without too much of a white cast. This was OK on first application - a little thick though so you need to work it in; then as you reapply, it turns into glue. Takes a lot to get it off of your body in the shower. However, no sunburns with multiple applications. No skin irritation. * It's not terrible, but I do not like it remotely, HALF as much as I like the Ulta brand one. I'm new to mineral sunscreens and I bought 2 from Sun Bum and 1 from Ulta. Both of the Sun Bum mineral sunscreens (SPF 30 and 50) are chunky and ridiculously harder to spread on the body. I felt like I was spreading toothpaste, or bondo on my legs and arms. I couldn't imagine trying to put it on my face. The Ulta brand is a sheer delight to put on in comparison. I felt like I COULDN'T rub it in and get past the white cast, and I am so pale I could blend in with a cloud. After seeing how hard it was on my legs (30SPF) and arms (50SPF), I didn't DARE use it on my face and I used the Ulta instead. 50SPF was the intended sunscreen for the face, but that wasn't happening with how delicate my face is from acne right now. Yeesh. I'll use the Sun Bums, and my husband will, but I definitely wouldn't repurchase it. Makes me reconsider the entire line from this brand after both tubes were so much chunkier in consistency and THICCER than your girls thighs versus Ulta's. * This is thick upon applying it, but after about 10 minutes it settles. I love this for my sensitive, allergy-prone skin. It is also chemical free which is great for sensitive skin! My favorite part is the no white cast. I don't know how they managed to do it without tinting it, but this is POC friendly. Also doesn't pill like most physical sunscreens do. * I purchased to use as a moisturizer sunscreen per recommendation of store associate to protect hyperpigmentation. This product is very thick and sticky. It burns my skin also. Not a good purchase. * I used the spf 50 version of this formula, but sadly it was too heavy for me and caused breakouts. This formula seems much lighter, the white cast is not bad, and the feel is good! Still a bit on the heavier side of sunscreens for me, which is why this is going to be my go-to winter sunscreen. I won't bother to look for another, this one does it the best! * A little background on my skin: I'm a redhead and have very fair/ pale skin (alabaster foundation) which is moderately sensitive and burns easily (and won't ever tan, it just peels and burns again). This sunscreen uses fragrance, but doesn't irritate my skin. It feels lightweight and not greasy. The formula is thin enough to easily apply and rub in quickly (much better than the Cotz mineral sunscreen for face and body, non tinted). It smells like coconut, which I love, and doesn't leave a cast or sticky grease layer on my skin.
If you have a deeper complexion than me and are concerned about a cast, I couldn't say for sure but I think this stuff is worth a try since it's so thin and rubs in so well. If you have very sensitive skin, just tread carefully as the scent is very strong. Definitely worth a try, but keep the receipt just in case it doesn't work for you. Hope this helps! * The only downside is that this uses fragrance. Thankfully, my skin isn't extremely sensitive so this is okay for me, but if you have very sensitive skin or are allergic to coconut I would tread carefully if you try this. If you don't have sensitive skin, it smells so nice and absorbs quickly without leaving a cast. However, I have very pale skin (I usually use Alabaster foundation with cool undertone) and don't know if this will leave a cast if you have a deeper complexion. It's thin enough that it's probably worth a try though, since you can rub it in so well. Hope this is helpful!"
241,cotz,mineral sun stick spf 45,pimprod2036814,2606141," * Very frustrated that Cotz advertises itself as healthy and ecoconcious when non of its products are. This Product received a poor raring on Yuka App. Product contains many harmful ingredients including dimethicone  which harms the environment and ends up in the blood of fish, birds and mammals building up in the environment without ever breaking down. Cotz advertising is an example of brand green washing at its finest. * This is good for touch ups when you're on the go. Despite being a stick format, it has a mousse like texture. I like that it can fit in a pocketbook (the cylinder shape makes it awkward for a pants pocket). This does feel heavy on my skin (normal/balanced type) and has a sticky/tacky feel after application. This also left a whitecast on my skin (Fitzpatrick type 2, fair Asian Skin, wear clinque foundation in shade bone; I swiped at least 4x per section of my face to have adequatecl coverage). The finish is definitely on the shiny side, especially for me. My preference is for matte or skinlike finish, so this was too shiny for me, but someone who likes a glowy finish may like this. I would recommend this for someone with fair skin on the dry side (or balanced/normal in a dry climate) and doesn't mind a shinier/""glowy"" finish."
242,ulta beauty collection,mineral sunscreen lotion spf 50,pimprod2003870,2536168," * I like how its not greasy and it dries matte but the white cast is so terrible. Im medium tan skin tone so i end up looking like a clown. Seriously its like white face paint on me and its hard to blend after it dries. Couldnt put foundation on too because it ended up pilling and made me look like i had patches * I use this daily on my face, neck, chest, and hands, alone or as a primer. I do rub it in well and have learned to avoid my eyelids, but around my eyes is fine. If you have oily skin, this one may not stay put. I have combination skin, fair and pink and prone to sunburn. It is one of the only mineral sunscreens that I will put on my face because I'm prone to breakouts. It's this or Cotz. Since Cotz is a tiny tube for the money, I got this to travel with and not need a separate body sunscreen. I've never gone back!

On your body, be sure to rub it in well. If you don't, it will transfer to your clothes. * It leaves a horrible white cast, and melts off when I sweat. It's really thick, and no matter how little I use, or how much I blend, I can't make it work. * It leaves a horrible white cast, and melts off when I sweat. It's really thick, and no matter how little I use, or how much I blend, I can't make it work. * I've been using this daily for about 2 weeks and love it.  I don't have any issues with a white cast so I'm not sure if other reviewers who have are using it correctly. I have dark olive skin and it looks fine on me. Just rub it in good.  It doesn't get greasy at all. I'm very pleased and will buy again. * Number 1, you need to use 1/4 tsp on your face and neck to get the spf protection on the label, for any brand. But the awful white cast just made me use less. Using the proper amount would make me look like a ghost. In fact, it actually did in a group photo a friend posted. When I saw it I was like OH NO. And I even had foundation over it. Also nice that you can't even read the new packaging. I'll use this up on my feet or arms I guess. * The scent is super strong and leaves a white cast."
243,supergoop!,zincscreen 100% mineral lotion spf 40,pimprod2042924,2621275," * I work in dermatology and have tried a LOT of sunscreens. I am very particular about sunscreen and this one checks all the boxes. It's all mineral, cruelty free, SPF 40, lightly tinted and a little bit hydrating. I have very fair skin and this blends in perfectly. Would work for light to medium skin tones. Would definitely recommend! * I've been using this sunscreen consistently for about a year and I love it.  It's lightweight, blends easily, and works well under makeup. * This is my favorite sunscreen and always need it in my skincare routine! I love the glow it gives me. It works perfectly under my makeup! * The second ingredient is Tetradecane which is toxic and known to cause cancerous tumors in mice. Deceitful marketing by saying it has ""clean"" ingredients. * I understand the 1 Star review, and it depends on the user and when the product is used.  I live in TX, and it is hot, hot, hot and humid so need something for my mornings in the garden with hat, etc.  Also, on a beach or for walking as eyeliner is my only real necessity going out the door for these activities.  I vary between a liquid foundation and a powder and am using the Mineral Matte Screen SPF 40. Matte products work best for me here. * This sunscreen is oily and made mg face look like a greased skillet. I waited ten minutes and then put on liquid foundation, and it was a slippery mess. Brush strokes all over my face. 
I cant say one nice thing about this product."
244,avÃ¨ne,hydrance+ moisturizing sunscreen lotion spf 30,pimprod2043842,2620352," * I really wanted to love this product because it is clean and highly rated on Yuka. However, it doesnt sink into the skin and I ended up with little white pilling all over my face. I tried using after thoroughly hydrsting my skin and still the same issue. Would not recommend * Oil-free but feels slimy and has a weird smell.  I have combo skin so it feels really greasy.  Glad I got it on sale and won't repurchase. * Might work on super dry skin, but not for my normal (sometimes normal/oily combo) skin.   Makeup is sliding off after 30 minutes.  Glad I purchased while on sale because not worth the full price.  Will keep to use on hands and neck since it does not smell and still need sunscreen protection. * I live by Avene products and wanted to love this so badly. Maybe I got a bad batch, but there is a lingering smell to this that I just cant get past. * As someone who has tried dozens of sunscreens, this one is elite in my opinion. The skincare in it makes my skin so glowy and hydrating and I love how dewy my skin looks when wearing. It wears well under make up, but you do have to rub it in well to prevent the white cast and so that the product absorbs in fully. It does feel a little bit sticky and a little heavy, but I don't necessarily mind that. Overall it feels more like skincare than sunscreen in my opinion and I will definitely repurchase."
245,proactiv,clear skin spf 30 face sunscreen,pimprod2033282,2595005," * Really liked the lightweight feel and absorption. Didn't break my skin out. However each time I wore this my forehead got burned. Definitely applied enough and wasn't out longer than recommended or sweating heavily. This has not happened wirh the other SPF products I've worn under my foundation. So I gave the rest to my darker-complected husband to use 🤣 * Gosh I wanted to love this so bad! It's lightweight, non-greasy, and gives my skin a nice glow. However, every time I use it, by the next day, there's zits that pop up. This is the only new product I've introduced. I believe it's the tocopheryl. :( * Very irritating * I need to wear sunscreen daily because of my acne products, but I've yet to find one that doesn't clog my pores even further. Seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I bought this when it was on sale. Sadly, it doesn't live up to the hype. It was lightweight on my skin, but it smells like cheap body sunblock. And every time I used it I had a new zit forming by the end of the day, without changing anything else in my skin routine. I wanted this to work so badly, but it does the opposite of being good for acne prone skin. * I was going to give 4 stars because it has a Proactiv scent I'm not in love with, However 5 stars because it does a great job as an spf as well as clearing up your face at the same time. * Since I am using retinol, my dermatologist insists that I wear sunscreen.  I have struggled to find any spf sunscreen that my reactive sensitive oily acne-prone mature skin doesn't breakout to and react to.

This is my first facial sunscreen success.  This one is great!  Doesn't leave me greasy or overly shiny.  Doesn't irritate or break out my skin.  I only wish it was higher spf, but better spf 30 than nothing. * I have very oily skin and hate wearing SPF. I have trial and errored so many mositurizers and this is the best one. Doesn't feel greasy or heavy on my skin. Actually has cut down on me looking greasy throughout the day. Highly recommend!"
246,beautystat cosmetics,universal c skin refiner 20% vitamin c serum + spf 50 mineral sunscreen,pimprod2037772,2604198," * I have been using the vit c serum without spf and loved it. This one feels very gritty going on takes a good while to absorb and dry down and it pilled as well. Does feel better after applying the moisturizer as recommended. Face now feels soft and not oily or greasy. Not sure if I will continue to use as my spf after this is finished, also small amount and expensive to use every day. * It is a more than wonderful serum for oily skin. It makes the skin clear, fresh, hydrated and free of blemishes. Youthful, attractive and vibrant. It makes the skin like the skin of children. It is like magic for the skin. * I lobe beautystat all products. vitamin C serum looks amazing would love to try. * I love the texture of this product so much & what it does for my skin. * This is one of my faves from beautystat! This has vitamin c in it as well as sunscreen! I love this two in one daily serum, not only does it protect me from the daily harmful rays but it also helps brighten my skin as it's preventing & eliminating my dark spots, wrinkles, and fine lines! I've only tried this for a few weeks and I can already see the difference and smoothness in my face and my neck! You should give it a try, followed by their amazing moisturizer! * Very good serum and it's a good price. I highly recommend it. I will continue to buy it. It brightens up my skin. * This has a gritty texture and leaves a little bit of a white cast. But thats expected from a mineral SPF and a small price to pay for a good formula. I feel good about using this as my daily protection because it gives my skin the brightening benefits of vitamin c.  Ill repurchase this. Its worth the money."

I purchased one without realizing it was expired and so I ordered two online. To my surprise, they were both expired and so I contacted PTR directly and they confirmed that it is no longer going to be sold. PLEASE BE AWARE OF EXPIRED PRODUCT. It may not be as effective for sun protection. I wish I could give this the 5 stars it deserves, but it would be irrelevant seeing as you can't make it a staple SPF. * ZERO STARS FOR ULTA!
I've ordered 2 each, of this product, at 3 different occasions and every single time, they have been expired! Then, I called Customer Service and, while they have been efficient at reimbursing my money, they send me labels to return the products.  So, in addition of being out of the product I need, I have now spent extra gas going to the post office, besides having to send them pictures of the items, that they've requested.  Ulta get it together! * I trust PTR products but I prefer mineral sunscreen for my face. Ulta carries the 2 PTR chemical based spfs. They discontinued the MINERAL SPF 45. WHY?! 😭 Plus these other two options are 12 and 50% MORE expensive?! and they provide NO TINT. 

Don't fix what's not broke. Please bring back the PTR MINERAL TINTED SPF 45.
Ugh. * Love this product, however, Ulta is out of it for the most part. Hard to get it here * I love this product.   I purchased it directly from Peter Thomas Roth's website.   I have used it for about a month now every day.  I can put it on my actual eye lid and entire eye area without reaction on one eye but not the other eye.  Strange  that I have one eye more sensitive than my other eye.  Living in Michigan we need extra Vitamin D during the winter.   This has that plus SPF 50 broad spectrum  UVA UV B protection etc.  When I put this on each morning and look at my skin after application,  I smile.   Each and every time,  I smile.  My skin glows and looks beautiful.   Makeup optional after applying this because it makes my skin look that healthy and beautiful.  I've use Peter Thomas Roth products for decades after my mom started gifting me his products.   I'm 52 but people say I look like I'm in my 30's.  Love that bonus from being a long time customer of PTR. * super soft and light weight makes my skin glow i have a mixed skin type so im not really oily but this is the second bottle im going to get!!!

Its perfect for my very oily skin and actually keeps me matte most of the day! I'm not in a very humid climate though. It works very well as a primer underneath a tinted moisturizer I use as well. * Sits on skin. Doesn't sink in. Stays white and wipes right off. * Nice sunscreen! Dries matte. Don't rub it in too much, it will roll off on your skin. * I love the way it absorbs into my oily skin and gives me a matt finish. It's not greasy and it's not fragrant. It is wonderful for in the hot Alabama sun and damp winter. * I have combo skin that in summer humidity is extremely oily and acne prone. This product is the absolute best product I have ever used to control shine, including regular non SPF moisturizers. Normally, I have to blot my face a dozen times a day, no exaggeration, and with this I don't have to blot at all! Life changing! It works amazing under makeup and the sun protection lasts all day. This does not dry the skin and I used it alone without another moisturizer. I use this even when not going outside just for the matte finish. It does not cause acne either. LOVE it. I read another review that mentioned pilling, I did not experience this."
249,dr. brandt,bright this way liquid sun shield spf 50,pimprod2039665,2613316," * Just recently traveled to the mountains in Utah. This was the sunscreen I used for my face and hands. I was shocked and amazed by how well this sunscreen worked. I was outside for hours at a time and did not have the opportunity to reapply and I did not get burned. I am a very fair skinned person that easily burns. That is the most important part, but also, no greasy residue and I have used at home and used makeup on top and had no issues with my makeup. The dropper is well, a dropper, so you just need to be patient when getting it out of the bottle and it is not an issue and you don't need much to cover your face. This is what I will use for facial sunscreen for as long as they continue to make it."
250,supergoop!,play 100% mineral lotion spf 50 with green algae,pimprod2037485,2606309," * First off this is not a true Mineral sunscreen. It has a chemical UV filter Butyloctyl Salicylate. Why it is not in the active Ingredient list boggles the mind. Is Supergoop! that lazy as are other brand who use this Chemical? This sent me to ER because it gave me huge skin rash just using it on hands. I have been with this horrible rash for 3 days now. I do not recommend for anyone who needs a mineral sunscreen or have sensitive skin. Wish I could give 0 stars. * Does it work? Yes. Otherwise. it leaves a very noticeable white cast on my fair/light skin. It is also difficult to rub in as it is a thicker formula. * I have medium colored skin and this peoduct left whitecast , it drys put ur skin and it is not possible to blend out once applied * I made the mistake of trying this right before leaving for vacation. The one day I wear it, my face/neck/arms turn very red, and extremely itchy and uncomfortable. As soon as this happened, I switched to products I know are safe for my skin. I slept with vaseline on my face the first night. The second day, my face was extremely swollen/puffy/inflamed. After I took a cool shower, the swelling reduced but it became extemely red, itchy, and uncomfortable again. This is currently day 3 after only using the product once, and my skin is only a little less red and less itchy, and when I use products I know are safe on my skin, it is now burning. Please DO NOT USE if you have sensitive skin!!!! * I bought this product since I heard good reviews about it. It left a white cast and it was very dry as well. * I ran put of sunscreen sooner than expected. The hotel was selling this sunscreen. I was a bit hesitant because I break out easily, but had to purchase since we were staying on a beach with intense sun. I wore this for 3 days, reapplied every few hours, and I did not get a single sunburn. Surprisingly, I also did not break out. There is a slight white cast, which I don't mind as it makes my skin look a bit glowy. I definitely would repurchase this sunscreen. * So, i guess mineral sunscreens just arent meant for me. I tried a bit on my hand in the store and was hopeful because it didnt leave a shiny grease spot on me, and i didnt notice the white pallor it left (dang tricky store lighting) but with the first face application, i could see i made a mistake. I am VERY fair to begin with and now i look like Casper with this lotion! Add to it the slight sting it causes and dry flaky skin the next day and this is just ALL bad. Only reason i gave 2 stars is because of the non-greasyness"
251,mario badescu,mineral sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2032183,2594658," * As a person with oily and acne prone medium color skin, this help me a lot, even i can see a little of white cast BUT zinc oxide have that effect and if you rub it good is almost unnoticeable and when it's completely absorbed you will no see any, and if you want good protection dermatologicaly speaking zinc oxide is the best option to protect your skin because only sits on your skin instead of chemicals that goes to your bloodstream and zinc oxide sunscreens (phisical/mineral) start working the moment it sits on your skin so ur waiting time is reduce to 5-10 min before sun exposure, i just wait 3 min cause sometimes i wake up late 😅 . I honestly prefer have have some white cast than having sunburn, early aging or chemical in my blood that will affect me in the future in some point. * It is mineral, is not greasy, doesn´t leave a white cast BUT I preffer something more liquid, more light.
And it expensive considering the content. * this sunscreen is great. at first i was not a fan but as continued to use it i found that the pros outweighed the cons. what i love about it is that one pump goes a long way and it spreads nicely. i also love that it doesnt leave a white cast. i apply this on my facial hair and it dries clear. its pretty insane. i was gagged when it dried clear on my BEARED! i was sold after that. it also leaves the skin tacky and glowy, which i love. the only con is that its watery but i noticed that it allows the sunscreen to spread and glide across the skin nicley. like i said, a little goes a long way. i think for people with facial hair, its hard to reach the skin underneath, so i do use more than the avergave person. its a decent amount of product for the price but for people who need to use more, it can be just enough for like a month. nonethless, she did what needed to be done. * I usually don't write reviews but I had such a terrible experience with this product that I felt it was only fair to share my results because my skin looked the worst that it has ever looked in my life!!

I had been using Mario Badescu's Hydro Moisturizer w/ Vit C and my skin was looking great with no breakouts.  Unfortunately, that moisturizer doesn't have SPF in it so I decided to try this sunscreen.  My skin isn't sensitive, but it could not handle this sunscreen. I experienced terrible breakouts around my jawline (which has never happened before) and it took a long time for my skin to clear.

I am a fan of Mario B's products, just not this one… * This is the most misunderstood sunscreen. It is so beautiful and lightweight. The glow is so  amazing! It wears beautifully under makeup too! * has a white cast… * I am always looking for a good mineral sunscreen. The ladies at Ulta recommended this one -and they were right! 
Lightweight, blends easily, slight white cast when first applied (I expect that with a mineral formula) but after waiting the requisite 15 minutes-it has disappeared into my skin. 
Good price point too"
252,undefined beauty,r&r sun elixir spf 30 glow oil,pimprod2045033,2626500," * I definitely could not tolerare having this on my face. The smell is super strong (smells like a hair oil but not inherently unpleasant), but it does not fade away. The pro to that is if you  put it on your scalp, you hair will smell great. The con is I don't want to smell that on my face and body all day. Had to return it for that reason. * I don't use a lot of bells and whistles on my skin but this is perfect for my everyday routine! * **RUN, DON'T WALK to grab R&R Sun Elixir!**  

I'm not usually a product person, but I picked this up on a whim, and WOW—I am *so* glad I did. This has completely transformed my morning routine because I genuinely *look forward* to using it every day. The scent? Absolutely divine. The texture? Perfectly smooth and lightweight. And the best part? It leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and hydrated *without* that heavy, greasy feel.  

If you're looking for a product that delivers luxury and nourishment in one bottle, **this is it.** Trust me, your skin will thank you! * This is a lightweight oil that is easy to use as a last step on top of my moisturizer! It rubs in quickly and isn't too oily * Pretty lightweight, hydrating and gives a subtle glow,feels nice on skin ,my combination skin looooovessss itt. * I'm absolutely in love with this product! It gives a beautiful glow without feeling greasy at all. I've been using it on my face, neck, and even in my hair—it works wonders everywhere! Plus, I'm so excited to support a fantastic Black-owned brand. It truly feels great to celebrate diversity while enjoying such an amazing product! * this is the only face oil I will use on my skin, it doesn't break me out and locks in hydration!!

Gross! * 10/10 * Oook. The product itself felt nice on my skin once finally blended but omgg the smell is atrocious. I saw one other review that mentioned it, but it literally smells like an iron pill (iykyk). Its NOT GOOD. It does go away after a while like once its been soaked in. I tried to overlook it, but its a no from me personally * Love this SPF it has a bit of a white cast but that goes away super fast it absorbs really well and I use my skin feeling good and not too oily * This is the 3 time that I've purchased this product. I am so in love. * I really like this sunscreen tint.  Make sure you shake it up before applying.  It goes on smooth, no cast. * One of my top sunscreens! Blends in so well!!"
254,pacifica,kind tint spf 30 tinted serum - broad spectrum mineral sunscreen,pimprod2037577,2604656," * I've been able to replace foundation with this product. It gives me a perfect light finish over my face, that being said i have pretty fair skin. I love how i can still see my freckles through it. I really like the way it smells too. It doesnt rub off when i apply my eye makeup, or if i scratch my face, and it doesnt pill up. It doesnt come out of the pump though, i just scoop it out apply it with my hands. I was stressed that pacifica discontinued all their foundations, so i tried this and im so happy i did because it works for me even better than their foundation. I will also add that i have acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. I hope they never stop making this product because its perfect for me. * I bought this looking for an SPF that would help even my skin tone, protect me from the sun, and hydrate my skin. 
This product feels like you're rubbing chalk on your face. It is super thick and hard to spread around your face, so you can't even blend it in. 
Forget about layering makeup on top of it, even by itself it leaves you with a cakey look. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product. I won't even be finishing what I have left of it. * This product feels like rubbing clay on your face, super drying and difficult to blend even on fair skin would not recommend * Goes on smoothly and has a slight scent to it. I don't notice any color tho. So nice for a sunscreen that sinks into your skin but my skin looks no different in tone after putting it on. * This is super lightweight, moisturizing, and easy to blend. It doesn't have a noticeable tint once its applied, and the spf level is great for everyday use but not prolonged sun exposure. A lot of reviews mention whitecast or pilling- I haven't had issues with either. I am very pale though. I only use it with other pacifica products, which might help prevent pilling. It's nice but I'll probably opt for the spf30 lotion once I run out. * apples like chalk * Actyally the worst sunscreen ever :( HORRIBLE white cast and pilled an insane amount. I waited for all of my products to absorb before putting this on and it still pilled like crazy and left an AWFUL white cast"

I have had some sunscreens that are too oily and make me shiny or break out and it doesn't do that. But it has a white cast and peels. Not good under makeup either. Overall pass. * At first i loved it except the strong fragrance. After a week of use its leaving ny skin burning. I hope i can return. I really wantes to be able to use this because i do like the consistency and how quickly it absorbs. * I love the clean ingredients, it leaves no white cast, feels light on the skin, and doesn't make my makeup pill! Seriously my ride or die."
