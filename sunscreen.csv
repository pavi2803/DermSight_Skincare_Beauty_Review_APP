1,tula,protect + glow daily sunscreen gel broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2016249,2562776," * Recommend !!!! * I really like this sunscreen, I am out in harsh weather and find that I don't burn (I reapply every 2 hours.) It leaves me with a light glow which I really like. I don't wear makeup so I'm not sure how it sits under foundation. * I love all Tula but unfortunately, this pills on my skin & it separates in the bottle so I've got to shake it and I lose some product each application. * I love this product. When you apply it, it adds a glow to your skin. The only downside is it is only a 30 SPF. Isiah it had the option of getting a stronger one. * I was looking for a new sunscreen and decided to give this a try because other Tula products have worked for me in the past. This sunscreen gave me small red itchy bumps all over my face. My skin looks horrible now! * Love, love, love * I wanted so badly to love this because i really like the brand. However, the formula is chunky and oily (like a lava lamp). Then once i applied it, my skin was peeling, dry and just gross."
2,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen spf 40,pimprod2029930,2589386," * I like this product didnt really have a problem with it, its just that i dont like how it feels on my skin. As someone with combination skin it would leave a matteish finish but after a few minutes i wouldn't see that matteiah finish and my glow would comeback. Some people like that glowy look but its just not for me because of my skin type and my preference. Good product just not for me. * I like this product didnt really have a problem with it, its just that i dont like how it feels on my skin.

Some people like that glowy look but its just not for me because of my skin type and my preference. Good product just not for me. * The Ulta Unseen Sunscreen SPF 50 which I received complimentary from Supergoop feels like a primer yet has the protection of a sunscreen.  I love it because it is beneficial for my skin as it diminishes pores and allows for smoother makeup application.   The formula is unique and stands out because of its performance.   I highly recommend especially for traveling and busy days. * This is my all time favorite sunscreen. It is so great for everyday and using underneath makeup. It doesnt pill or change the texture of my makeup. Its weightless and it doesnt leave a white cast. Obsessed! Gifted by supergoop * It's good, just not worth money or intrigues me anymore. Burns eyes, makes skin slightly irritated. Wouldn't buy because there's better for sale out there. * I really like this sunscreen. I buy this size, because I think it is too expensive. * i've struggled with finding a face sunscreen for decades. i'll never look elsewhere. feels so good when it goes on (smooth!) and disappears instantly. isn't shiny, isn't matte, doesn't have any sort of cast. no weird smell. makes a great base for makeup and washes off easily."
3,la roche-posay,anthelios uv correct spf 70 daily face sunscreen with niacinamide,pimprod2030180,2591831," * This sunscreen is sheer and I like it very much. Sadly, it's one that creeps up into my eyes and burns. * This is a hard review to write because in a lot of ways its exactly what I'm looking for: moisturizing, has spf, gentle. The big reason I wouldn't buy it again is it melts into my eyes and stings terribly. Ive actually had to pull off the road barely able to keep my eyes open another second with a waterful of tears (product induced— not weeping) making the whole situation worse. It must not happened to everyone, which is why I gave it for stars. It just doesn't work for me. * I think this is the BEST spf ever!!! I'm 42 and have always had dry skin and I absolutely love this SPF.  It's not oily at all, I know some are oily/greasy but for me it's buttery and zero white cast. My skin feels so nice and hydrated and wears so nicely under makeup, zero pilling.  I've used it for a few years now and if I try something new, I always find myself coming back to this. Highly recommend!! * I bought this product after seeing an influencer rave about it on IG whike using it under her makeup application. Worst results ever. I used it a couple times on my trip to the islands. Went out and applied it before applying my primer, makeup and doing regular routine. The whole time I'm outdoors I kept wondering why my face feels like I'm in a sauna. It made me sweat so much and my face felt greasy and more oily. I then tried the same routine without this product and realized it was this that affected my change. Never buy or use again. * It left too much of a white cast for me to want to continue to use and was difficult to smooth across my skin. * I have light-medium oily skin and live in a dry climate. This sunscreen blends well, but leaves a dewy shiny finish; so much so that even matte foundations can't cover it and my skin gets oily within a couple of hours. * Did not like this product. I have some what sensitive skin and it stings so bad!!! My sister tried it out as well and it did as well for her."

5,vacation,classic whip spf 30 sunscreen mousse,pimprod2033019,2596247," * Love everything about this except that it makes my eyes burn and water even wheb I dont put it around that area * LOVE IT, this sunscreen made my skin so soft and dewy! Made my makeup look amazing as well everyday! * yes, the packaging is cute, but the dispenser stopped working with at least half a bottle left. because its air-pressured (or whatever it's called) i don't want to try to open it in any way. really annoying because i love the formula but i cant bring myself to rebuy when i had to waste half of the bottle. * I didnt pay much mind to the few people who left reviews saying this sunscreen made their skin burn and eyes water. Behold! Twas a fool as I fell victim these problems! 

I did a spot test without issues, giving it a whole 24 hours before applying to my face. The first time I applied it, I noticed maybe 3-4 hours in that there was a very slight yet noticeable stinging/burning sensation that lasted all day once it started. Didnt pay mind to it because it was not too bothersome. 

Washing my face that evening, i noticed my eyes became sensitive quickly after. More so, when i started my skin care routine things got concerning. I applied the retinol treatment ive been using every other day with no problems ever, suddenly starting burning my skin so badly that my face became hot red and terribly irritated!! I thought I just did a poor job of removing all the sunscreen, so next use i made sure to use a wash that i knew removed sunscreen. To my disappointment, treating with vit C that time, I had another painful reaction. 

Needless to say, my skin did not appear damaged over both ordeals - no rashes, ance, redness - the morning after. It smells great and feels amazing when you apply it. However,  the burning with skincare is not acceptable. Additionally, my eyes would be water like crazy over night, which is not tolerable if i am loosing sleep over it. 

I suppose the purpose of this review is simply for buyer beware: you may think the product will work for you given the good reviews, but be conscious of this product! * This SPF is my new fav for body. It's not greasy AT ALL and sits so comfortably on the skin. * Bought this for a trip to Curacao and perhaps this sun was too strong this lil guy but I used the entire can on the first day. I'm left with the worst sun burn of my life. I let my uncle borrow who was also very excited about the whipped cream function and he's also extremely burned. * Immediatley after I put this sunscreen on to TEST it out at home, my skin started to itch and tingle, resulting in a rash. Thank GOD I did not put it on my face. The smell is also awful, it was an extremely chemical smell with a side of chemical coconut. I had to wash it off immediately and the smell still lingered. The packaging is obviously so cute but the product itself is awful. I should have returned it right away but ended up throwing it away. There are too many reviews with similar experiences so AVOID THIS PRODUCT."

It gives my brides rhr most perfect glow without staining their expensive dresses, it provides protection from the sun and it smells amazing! * This item is a staple in my Bridal Makeup Kit. It gives my brides rhr most perfect glow without staining their expensive dresses, it provides protection from the sun and it smells amazing! * This is my go-to sunscreen in the summer! I love it * Pricey for sunscreen- I bought it more for glowy leg szn- the bottle was gone in 3 applications to my legs only. Sticky- and shimmer did get everywhere. * Would not suggest this as a sunscreen.. ended up burning badly… not sure if the bottle i bought was expired, but i will never vary fro hawaiian tropic spf 30 ever again * Used one time and used a ton of product. This will last maybe 8/10 uses max. Disappointing."
7,supergoop!,on-the-go spf duo,pimprod2044871,2623031, * buy this now and throw it in your purse for the summer! this is the best sunscreen. a little bit goes a long way and it's so light weight! * Loved this sunscreen
8,supergoop!,play everyday lotion spf 50 with sunflower extract pa++++,pimprod2030629,2589403," * This sunscreen is such a daily necessity for me! I love using it daily to protect my skin against the sun and love how easily it rubs into my skin and how high the spf is! It doesn't leave a white cast gifted by supergoop * Complimentary from SuperGoop. I tried it for the first time so I don't have much of an opinion on it as yet. It does feel super smooth and lightweight which is good especially for the girls like me that sweat a lot * This sunscreen by supergoop is absolutely lovely! I use this everywhere. My face, my body. It feels great on the skin and doesn't leave any white cast or oily residue. Would absolutely recommend this sunscreen! Gifted by supergoop * The Supergoop! PLAY Everyday Face Lotion SPF 50 gifted by supergoop is a great daily sunscreen option for those looking for lightweight, fragrance-free protection. It blends in clear with no white cast, making it ideal for all skin tones and layering under makeup. The formula is non-greasy, hydrating, and includes ingredients like glycerin and rice bran extract to support the skin's moisture barrier. With water and sweat resistance for up to 80 minutes, it's a reliable choice for outdoor activities. * Bought this to fill 3oz travel containers for an upcoming trip. Super easy to fill the containers with this. The smell is so nice! Feels light and not thick or goopy on my skin(despite the name). I really love this product however it is very pricey. * If you have acne or a meduim to nromal skin then dont buy!! Made my face super oily and kinda has a weird minty feeling when applied. I did not enjoy this experience. * This product is so expensive, but i think it can be worth it. I admit it is a little sticky on my face and skin, but that never bothered me. I dont have oily nor dry skin, I glow with this sunscreen on, i put it on before my makeup and it hasnt messed with the application. It doesnt clear my skin, but i dont break out from this product. I burn easily, yet I lathered up in this sunscreen ONE TIME in the morning during a very hot summer, laying exposed under the sun all day at the beach without reapplying and i left with no burn lines or nothing. However, Im unsure about how water resistant it is. The sunscreen is easy to apply, it rubs in so smoothly. Id recommend buying in store because when I ordered online once, the seal was leaking and i had to exchange it, so i would not risk it. While i do wish this was a bit cheaper for the amount of product i get, i havent bought from another brand since i got on this once. On top of that, i love the fragrance of it, it doesnt have that typical sunscreen smell to it which is a bonus. Overall, i havent had an unpleasant experience with this product so far!"
9,la roche-posay,anthelios melt-in milk body & face sunscreen lotion spf 100,pimprod2013150,2559778," * I have been using this product since it was first brought to the US by Dr. Bryant at least 25 years ago.  My skin looks at least 15 years younger than my actual age.  I use it everyday 365 days a year.  It's great. * Not for oily to combination skin. Face looks greasy all day. * I used the product on my face and it caused an itchy painful red bumps on my whole face even my eye lid (pictures indicated as ""After""). It took about 72 hours to return to normal (picture indicated as ""Before""). I have repeated and confirmed the reaction 3 times. * Pricey, but use small amount on both body and face. Not greasy and protects well. Have used this line for several years and have not been disappointed. * Awesome product * I love this sunscreen very good 10/10 * I bought this because I have rosacea and needed a higher spf but hated that other spfs smelled and felt like your typical sunscreen. The feel of this is super smooth and my face felt hydrated afterwards. However my skin pilled SOOOOOOO much. No matter what i did or how I changed the amount I put on. It also triggered breakouts for me in my t zone (I have combination skin). Since stopping it, I've realized a lot less flare ups. But as a sunscreen itself, it does its job."
10,vacation,orange gelÃ©e spf 30 sunscreen gel,pimprod2044868,2623026," * Love, love love! * I was so excited to get this, only to be terribly disappointed.  It smells like rancid oil based product,  nothing like the original Bain de Soillel is was based on. I will be returning it. * I LOVED the smell of this but it's VERY greasy. I don't understand why this is so highly rated. I tried it for a few days and it was just so greasy. I'd keep applying smaller and smaller amounts which meant I wasn't applying enough to get the SPF on the tube and it was STILL greasy. this product NEVER soaks in and any time I played my arms down, it'd leave a greasy mark. I also found that this stained my clothes too.

I will say, I need the smell as a perfume but this sunscreen sucks * A perfect dupe for the long gone Ban de Soleil Suntan Gelee Orange.  Fragrance is spot on.  Cannot wait to use at the beach.  Oh, how I have missed this from using in the late 70s. * The scent is not right and the texture is not right. They tried but it misses the mark and it's disappointing coming from a genexer who grew up using it every summer. * It smells like strongly like cinnamon/pumpkin mix to the point that when I apply it, I don't breathe. The texture so sticky and doesn't absorb well into the skin. I end up leaving greasy marks wherever my arms and legs touches. The only plus is that the SPF does work since I didn't get sunburn from it. * It does not, in any way, smell like the old Bain de Soleil...just so you know...Returning...as that's the only reason to purchase this product."

14,vacation,super spritz spf50 face mist,pimprod2038618,2606383," * I have mixed feelings about this one. Overall, I like that it's SPF 50 and easy to reapply on the go, but I have to keep it upright in a plastic bag because the container leaks! The product is not greasy, but I dont feel like it fully absorbs into the skin and can be a bit sticky. That doesnt bother me when I'm at the beach, but I wouldn't use this as my every day sunscreen. * I think this might be my 5th bottle. 
I've tried most of the spray sunscreens at Ulta, Supergoop, Coola.. etc. this one is my favorite and the cheapest! 

Coola deserves honorable mention, but this formula is so similar and half the cost.

Sungoop was a waste of money and the spray applicator made it useless because it was so uneven. * I wanted to love it but I broke out and itched for a week on cheeks and neck. * This chemically burned my skin. I hope they remove this soon not worth the pain and agony * I just dont like it. It was expensive first of all, then it smells weird but whatever i can live. Then i wear it and it burns the heck out of my skin. Mind u my skin can take a beating. This feels like bleach and chemicals and acid. I honestly dont know why it burns the face so much. Its ok on the body but feels greasy. But omg the way it feels on the face, take this off the shelf before u get in trouble vacation. Dont even ask me how it feels when u sweat it into ur eyes….. * This basically cooked my face instead of protecting me. My skilln is red, swollen, and itchy! * It's a fast and easy way to apply sunscreen. It doesn't have an unpleasant oder.  A great way to finish my morning skin care routine. It can burn your eyes if you open them immediately after applying. It's best to wait a few seconds."
15,la roche-posay,anthelios uv hydra sunscreen spf 50 with hyaluronic acid,pimprod2043464,2620128," * It has taken me forever to find this unicorn—no stinging eyes (even during exercise), lotion/thin consistency, absorbs quickly, makeup lays well over top, and spf FIFTY! I wasnt good about wearing sunscreen because I couldnt find the right product—until now. So happy! * This is a good product, it is totally invisible and VERY hydrating. It pairs well for me while I use tret since it is so hydrating. However, it does sit on the skin as VERY oily. But it doesnt break me out and is light, so I'm leaning towards this being a good product that I will probably rebuy. * Sunscreen works well. It's lightweight and blends easily. Plus it's not greasy which is great. My old facial sunblock would get so greasy when out and about in the sun, this one does not. * Wanted to try it and and its me new fave. * Yes, it really is invisible! I have acne prone skin and it does not break me out. This is my favorite sunscreen to date! This is the first La Roche-Posay product I've used and it's making me want to try more! * Painfully dry lips, swelling in cheeks. Never had a reaction to an SPF quite like this. * I'm not sure if its the ""dewy finish"" or whatever, but this sunscreen is very oily on my skin. It feels like a layer. However it is invisible which is a plus."

I don't have acne and I don't suffer from dryness. If anything, my skin is a little oily. I hage tried every product under the sun for almost 20 years. This tinted spf is pretty phenomenal. It makes my skin look perfected and glowy. It also blends easily and the color is just right. You also can't beat the price. This is a staple for me. * This was not only not hydrating at all, but it was extremely chalky on the skin. It did not rub into the skin well at all and left a pilled texture and extreme whitecast. The sunscreen dried quickly, meaning it was difficult to wipe off. * Noooooo * Noooooo * I love using this tinted moisturizer when I know I will be out in the sun a lot.  It gives great protection and coverage. * I'm so glad I found this product. I have rosacea and fine lines and wrinkles so this covers like makeup, gives me the mineral sunscreen I NEED, is fragrance free, and doesn't settle in my lines. It's difficult finding something for skin like mine and I'm happy with it."

Dont buy! Its ok on skin, moisturizing on body, Dont use on face."
20,supergoop!,mineral mattescreen spf 40,pimprod2029941,2589388," * This is the first spf product that makes me look forward to applying it. I have sensitive, rosacea prone skin and this does not irritate it at all. The formula is fluffy and cloud like and goes on so smooth. Looks great under makeup or on its own. * I love that it does not make my face look shiny or oily. The texture, the tint (to prevent white cast) are perfect for my skin. It also works great with all my other skincare and makeup products. * Silky smooth, goes on light and easy. No white cast or tint. It's a little pricey but worth it for a high quality, everyday sunscreen. * This sunscreen is great for sun protection (wore it everyday with UV indexes up to 10 with no burns) and blurs my pores beautifully. It also sits very nicely under makeup. With this said, you have to be careful what skincare you wear underneath this sunscreen because it can pill. With this said, it doesn't pill at all when worn on its own or when it is on top of moisturizers and skin care with thinner consistencies. * I wanted to love this after seeing rave reviews but it was SUPER drying on the regular-to-dry parts of my face. Great for my oilier T-zone bur not for a daily overall sunscreen * Not bad when you firsr put it on but it oxidizes on your face after a little bit and turns your face orange. * I chose this after researching mineral sunscreens. It has the consistency of a powder/gel hybrid and goes on like silk, leaving a smooth matte finish and no white cast.

The only barrier to my repurchasing is the high cost of such a small amount of product."
21,la roche-posay,anthelios melt-in milk body and face sunscreen spf 60,pimprod2018267,2570181," * my favorite sunscreen because of the protection and wear. this is NOT for melinated people of any kind as the white cast is ... offensive, as another reviwer said. the finish is super greasy and shiny and stings your eyes crazy, but as long as you avoid your eyes you should have no issue. i dont mind the greasy finish because i prefer dewy makeup. my biggest pro about this sunscreen is the wearability, i wear it under makeup and havent had a SINGLE pilling incident. 

all in all this product is great for white, no makeup girlies, do with that as you do * This product helped me a lot with my face spots * Great product * Mixed feelings on this one. It definitely leaves a white cast. Don't wear dark colored clothing with this sunscreen because if it smears on your dark colored clothes, you will see it. If you have black leather interior for your car, don't wear this. you will see the sunscreen on your leather interior. It will come off if you wash or wipe it off. Other than that, great for sensitive skin. Its on the thicker side and it takes awhile to blend. * I received a sample of this from Ulta & it has been a game changer!!! It melts on my skin right away, it does have some type of white pigmentation, but I just massage it in my skin really well & problem solved. It def helps with the sun, my skin feels refreshed & protected at the same time. My friends, family & co-workers at work have seen the difference when I wear it. They tell me my face glows even from far away! This has been so far, the best sunscreen I've been wearing lately & I'm about to buy the actual size to have for myself bc I used all 3 samples LOL that's how good it is!!! * It the best , i never use sunscreen before but this one is the best, melt on the skin 👌 * It leaves a little bit of white cast on blank skin"
22,e.l.f. cosmetics,suntouchable whoa glow broad spectrum spf 30 sunscreen,pimprod2036596,2605491," * Obsessed with this product with one caveat: the color you choose does make a difference. The deepest color definitely has real glitter in it whereas the color I love, Sunbeam, does not. Sunbeam just has a beautiful glow and I actually prefer it to the Supergoop version. I've purchased multiple times now, I hope they never discontinue it! The best base out there. * I was so eager to love this product because it feels incredible right after applying it, but no matter what I do, every time I put it on, it starts peeling after a while. I'm not sure if I'm just not doing it correctly, but either way, it shouldn't be this difficult. * I really like this sunscreen and would buy it again * I received a sample of sunbeam, and in a rare move for me, purchased the full size.  I am a light medium neutral shade and it gives me a slight glow -- more subtle than supergoop, less shiny than Fenty's mineral sunscreen (which I thought I was going to be my main go-to) and more moisturizing than Saint Jane.  I keep going back to this one bc I like the texture, packaging and everything about it.  I have sensitive, rosacea skin and this has NOT broken me out or aggravated me.  I wish this was mineral - that is my only neg comment!  Will be repurchasing. * My makeup looks great with this under it and its a great option for sunscreen, however i have to put everytbing on super carefully because this product pills and is patchy on the skin more than anything I've ever had. Sad * My makeup looks great with this under it and its a great option for sunscreen, however i have to put everytbing on super carefully because this product pills and is patchy on the skin more than anything I've ever had. Sad * I got this as a alternative to the supergoop tinted sunscreen. However this is just a glittery mess. It patches up on the skin pretty badly and flakes a little. It also slightly burned a little when i put it on. I love elf products but this one was a miss."
23,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen body spf 40 invisible sun protection,pimprod2038031,2606364," * I do really like this sunscreen- it's like a clear gel with a velvety finish (think primer consistency). It's rather expensive though for what you get- considering it's a body sunscreen, this wouldn't even get you through a week at the beach. * No matter which supergoop I try they are heavy greasy they do block the sun but feel horrible * Me gusta mucho, no deja la piel grasosa, te da brillo y protege * Absolutely terrible! I broke out in a rash about an hour after using. Theew it away immediately! * I love the OG unseen sunscreen for my face and its the perfect texture and viscosity. I was hoping this would be too. I hate the lotion texture of others so i was really excited that SG came out witb this. The only problem is that its just oily… it absorbs well and makes my skin feel REALLY SOFT but since i do sweat pretty easily it can feel a bit slick at times. Maybe its the olive oil in it? Or its just too many oils. * Goes on like silk and absorbs quickly. * This is a unique sunscreen. It slides onto my skin without an oily feel and immediately disappears like water. I like working in the yard. The Unseen Sunscreen Body enables me to be outside without getting a tan or sunburn in this hot summer sun. Other brands of sunscreen have felt oily and were a bit difficult to apply without some effort. The Supergoop! spread easily. It was a delightful surprise!"
24,kopari beauty,sun on the run sunscreen travel kit,pimprod2043796,2618937," * Wanted to try the roll on stick, its not great though. Its very oily and never dried down, not great for on the go and would stain your clothes. It does have glitter in it which i thought was cute and fun, didnt bother me since i wanted this for a disney trip to be fun anyways. The serum is fantastic, i ended up returning this set snd buying that full size. It doesn't give any shimmer which is misleading since it looks shimmery in the bottle. But it protects well, high spf, dries down quickly and felt moisturizing. * Literally the most amazing sunscreen ever! Your skin feels smooth and not greasy. * bought this to test the products instead of buying the full sizes separately. I dont find the sun shield body glow to give much of a glowy look. the stick does give off some shimmer/glitter. also I've found these products dont really settle in my skin and makes me sweat more. I do wish this kit came in the darker shades * I feel like I got a really great deal because I got the full size stick, which I love!  It took a couple of swipes but love how portable this stick is and the glow.  I always wanted to try their other sun products so I'm happy I got a chance to * Love the options in this kit! it's perfect for the summer. All the ingredients are clean and moisturizing, but not sticky. * My bumps on my chest came overnight . Theyre not normal, it will take MONTHS to get rid of these hard crators ! :( * Both of the face products apply wonderfully and work well under makeup. I have been looking for sunscreen with glitter and the stick gives a subtle sparkle without looking like you got attacked by a child's craft project. The price is also great - you get enough product to try before you decide if you want a full size."
25,it cosmetics,hello sunshine invisible sunscreen for face spf 50,pimprod2044384,2623536," * Let this product sit on your skin for at least two minutes before laying products on top. I'm on a mission to finding a good sunscreen underneath makeup. This product makes me so happy. Sets so perfectly underneath product, does not pill, does not have too much fragance and the texture is chefs kiss. 10/10…100/10 * I really wanted this sunscreen to work but unfortunately my skin does not like an ingredient/s in the formula. The first 2 times I wore it I didn't have any problems and thought all was going well until the next time I used it and the several times after it made my eyes burn (for reference I have oily, sensitive skin). I was so disappointed because I really liked how it made my skin look and it doesn't have a strong scent either, but it just didn't agree with my skin. I will finish the tube up and use it on another part of my body, just not on my face. Unfortunately I will not be repurchasing. * What I loved: doesn't leave a greasy finish and looks great underneath foundation.
What I didn't love: cystic acne has always been an issue for me. I haven't had a flare in about two years but this changed after using this product. Ruined my skin barrier. * I don't use foundation. I only use a primer and so far this product is the best. I will be a repeat customer.  I also liked the affordable price. * The best face sunscreen I've ever used - I've tried all the trendy products from Supergoop to innisfree, but the texture and feel on my skin have always been so unpleasant that I've never been able to stick to a sunscreen routine. This is such a game changer - it feels like a milky serum, absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin glowy instead of chalky. I've also basically stopped using primer under my makeup! * It goes on easy, does not smell, but made me break out everywhere and worsened my melasma :( * Just wish it was tinted."
26,shiseido,clear sunscreen stick spf 50+,pimprod2022854,2576053," * This is the best face sunscreen ever. I habe repurchased this over and over. The price is high but it lasts forever if its ever one sale BUY it. Ive tried so many and this is the best one for under makeup * Not very greasy. slides on easy. Be sure to get everywhere. I was in a hurry and didn't swipe my entire forehead 😆😆 and it showed. * I have been testing a lot of sunscreens since a was a kid and believe me when i say this one is the best by far ! * I've loved it, easy to go and reapply sunscreen. The down side of it was the smell of the sunscreen, i will say throughout the day its not that bad. * Absolutely love this sunscreen stick. I always keep in my purse so its my go to sunscreen whenever i have to reapply or if i forget. Doesnt feel greasy and has been really great for my sensitive skin. Will definitely be buying another once i run out! * I love this sunscreen type. Shiseido never disappoints on recipes. But this stick has way too little product to purchase at this price. I wanted it for my hands. I have the same 5.0 oz formula for my face and needed a tidy solution for regular hand application. The stick was great for a month then mostly gone. The rest is stuck in the plastic. Total tease. I would buy again if offered in a larger size. * im otw to buy my next one!!!"
27,good molecules,sheer mineral sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2037436,2606130," * DO NOT BUY THIS! I believe they changed their formula or something because I have been using it for a little over 2 years and since September I started having bad experiences with it. I stopped using it all winter and just yesterday tried it again because it's getting hot where I live. And it gave me the WORST rash ever all over my face and neck, to the point of me going to the ER because I could t handle the pain and itchiness😭 * i cannot believe that good molecules has not pulled this product yet. my 72 year old mother broke out with an awful allergic reaction to, what we determined by process of elimination, was this product. then lo and behold i come to ulta's site and see the low product rating (3.6 stars) thanks to all the one-star reviews that they are seemingly just ignoring. all of the allergic reaction symptoms that others are experiencing and showing photos of match my mother's exactly. she is currently using a topical steroid to help with returning her skin to normal. the saddest part is that she doesn't even have sensitive skin and has had little to no skin problems throughout her life. the red swollen itchy skin on her face that still won't go away after discontinuing use of the product has been a huge blow to her confidence. SHAME ON YOU GOOD MOLECULES EXECUTIVES. is it really worth the cash grab?? listen to your consumers and do something about this. * Ive never expericned sometjing like this with another product. The same day i put this product on my face, it gave me bumbs, a burning rash. My face was so swollen the next day and it burned so bad. * Very light weight,  perfect for under makeup * Im on my second bottle, I have combo/oily skin so I'm a bit picky with my sunscreen but I really love this one. Its not badly priced either! I'm hispanic and it doesnt leave a white cast on me either. I hope they never stop making this 💘 * Love this product because it doesn't leave a white cast. * So I went to Ulta to pick up sunscreen because I had ran out of mine that day. The store location I went to had very few face sunscreen options (like literally 4 brands in the entire store, I asked). A nice employee recommended the Good Molecules facial sunscreen and said it wasn't greasy and laid nicely under makeup. 

However, it leaves a very noticeable white cast. I am very pale and it made my face look like a corpses. It's so hard to find a good facial sunscreen that doesn't leave white cast and unfortunately this is the case with this one too!"
28,coola,classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 50,pimprod2012268,2561101," * My first purchase was before changed the packaging and l'm assuming the formula too?
It was perfectly fine, I hardly got sunburn.
However, when they changed the packaging and formula, I got a bad sunburn for 3 months and I had to stay at home, to heal. After healing, I wanted to return this item, they wouldnt accept it. * I love this stuff!  It smells divine and really does its job as a sunscreen.  My only complaint is the price.  I usually wait for a sale and then splurge on this product. * I have been using this for years and it works amazingly. I am fair skinned and have had zero issues with it. Love how light it feels, and I so appreciate there's a fragrance-free option. * This sunscreen is fantastic! Love the guava mango scent! I used this while paddle boarding on the lake in my bikini all day in 100° temps. I reapplied once mid day and no sunburn! I use self tanner but this was my first big day in the hot summer sun. * I love Coola sunscreen. The spray applies well. I bought the travel size since I was going on vacation and only bringing a carry on and the regular size would be too big. I was a tad disappointed that these did not last the entire week. My husband and I were the only ones using the spray and we brought 2 new travel bottles with us, but they only made it to about 2/3 of the vacation. It would be nice if there was a TSA approved size that could go a little further. Besides that though, it had a good application that lasted well and as always, I love the scent. * Its an anazing product. Snells anazing, and definitely fets the job done. My only negative is that its a chemical sunscreen. Great for occational use, but not a daily summer sunscreen bc of that. * My husband and I had the worst experience with this product today, so I ran to the reviews to see if others had a problem with it. Sure enough, others mentioned that they burned badly & quickly when using this product. We spent 1 hour in overcast weather, me wearing a long sleeve hoodie, before the sun came out and we decided to wear our T shirts and SPF. We were super confused when very shortly afterwards, we were BURNED!! This wasn't the most intense sun either. I tried to protect myself & my husband with this product and it caused more harm than good. 0/10, don't even risk it."

Good coverage, but gone way too quick for the price paid. * I boight this forbmy daughter to ise since we mived from Ga to Fl.  She used it that morning and bu the time she for home from school her face was covered in rash. She has oily amd sensitive skin. Super disappointed especially how people was raving about this products for African American Skin tone * Best sunscreen ever! * This is the second bottle of SuperGoop's aerosol bottle from Ulta that did not work! Like, full bottle and nothing came out after many many attempts. Both bottles went back to the store! Thankfully, Ulta's customer service was excellent! * It left a horrible rash on my arms and hands- i even tried to make sure it was from this product so i applied it on my feet and they started to burn too. * I got addicted to supergoop when I first tried Unseen Suncreen but now use all their products. The spray on this sunscreen is impressive. * This is a really great sunscreen for the entire family. Smells really good and feels refreshing on the skin. I will continue to purchase all Supergoop suncreen products!"

But it seems to work its way into my eyes, and it stings for a long time. I don't think I will buy it again, but it is good enough. * Thats all jusy buy it! * purchased this due to the spf rating. I use Olay sensitive during the winter months and usually add Neutrogena SPF, but I found this product this spring and decided to try it. I absolutely love. I use serum first and then this. I absorbs nicely and doesn't leave my skin sticky. I use under my eyes and my eye lids and I do not experience any burning. I occasionally use powder foundation and it holds all day. the scent is nice and not over powering like other products. * Wanted to love this product however it burns my eyes!! * Great product. * I can only put this on about half of my face because of how incredibly badly it makes my eyes sting. Even if I take care to avoid the eye area, it creeps in them somehow. Feels nice as a moisturizer but it makes me look more sweaty/oil slick than glowy. Have to completely cover my face with setting powder for my skin to not look wet. * this product provided a good moisturizer for my skin but it left my skin oily. I used it with a hydrating serum after but I also used the moisturizer by itself and it still made my skin oily. It made my face smell like sunscreen but it helped with an initial layer of sun protection. If it wasn't so oily I would like this product."
32,kopari beauty,rose gold sun shield body glow gel spf 45,pimprod2037855,2605238," * Its a little sticky. I was hoping it woukd feel lighter * I wanted to love this.  It went on well, but my daughter and I ended up sunburned. Its a very light clearish gel, so maybe you just need to put more on; I'm used to the creams, where you can tell easier, just how much you're rubbing in. * I love this product and have been using it for years.  As someone with dry skin, I love the glow and hydration this gives my skin.  I prefer this texture compared to standard sunblocks. * The smell is nice but the consistency is very oily. It feelsl like it never soaks into the skin so it just sits on the skin, oily. I will be returning. * I normally don't have any issues with shimmery products or sunscreens causing eczema flareups, but even just rubbing this on my hands to try it out caused my skin to feel SO oily and yet also very dry within a few minutes. These types of dry-feeling oils are enemy #1 for my eczema for some reason and sure enough, even with washing my hands after I got home (with my normal eczema-safe soap) I got a flair up on the insides of my fingers the next day. The only product that was different was this, so I'll try other Kopari sun products on my body but not this one. If you don't have such sensitive skin, I think it smells very beach vacation-y and looks really pretty! It isnt the scent either, I don't have any fragrance sensitivities and have used the Kopari body spray without issue. * I use this layered with super goop .. i noticed this hydrates my skin and grels ao luxe. I went through my gold kopari , noe on mt rose gold. Love the way it looks on my skin on the beach or by the pool * I purchased this to wear at Lollapalooza. I put Nivea cream and Kopari beauty rose gold sun shield body glow gel spf45 on top. It smells so good. I get allergies with perfume but not with this scent. I smelled so good. Every female I spoke to asked what I was wearing. I was able to bring this in my clear bag, so I gave them some. I am allergic to the sun, I did NOT get a rash and I looked tanned. I recommend this to everyone as it lasted all day for me. 11am-10pm"
33,la roche-posay,anthelios ultra light sunscreen lotion spray spf 60,pimprod2018266,2570213," * Ive given this sunscreen many chances and everytime it gets into my eyes. It burns for a while too. As soon as you use a towel/rag to soothe your eyes a minute later they'll start burning again. This can happen for hours. Wanted to love this because it doesn't leave a white cast if you rub it in enough, but the eye burning isn't worth that. * i bought this in store at the beginning of summer after an employee recommended it to me. i'm a natural redhead, so im pretty pasty and prone to skin cancer/burning easy. i was hesitant because it was super pricy - but a little goes a long way!!! i work outside in the sun all day and have every day for the summer, and i havent burnt ONCE since buying and actively using this. i still have over half the bottle after 2/3 months. it is so worth the money. * I really wanted to like this BUT I've used it a few times and for some reason, after about an hour, even though I'm not sweating, this sunscreen starts to get in my eyes and even my mouth! Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation. It has Benzophenone in it, which can cause contact  dermatitis. I get an allergic reaction on my eyelids every time I've used this product. * OMG this is the best sunscreen I've found for my skin, it's refreshing and soft and doesn't leave your skin white or thought of it. I loved it * Goes on white but leaves no white cast on brown skin after rubbing it in. I love how the spray disperses the product evenly. I dont recommend using it on your face directly though. Steep price for an average sunscreen. * This sunscreen is great. I have very oily acne prone skin and this rubs in well and does not make me greasy at all unlike other sunscreens."
34,coola,organic classic face sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2003902,2541377," * This sunscreen has quickly become my new everyday sunscreen! I have sensitive skin and sunscreen can burn or cause a rash but this sunscreen is absolutely sensitive skin safe! It goes on smoothly with no pilling and it does not cause any irritation to my skin. This facial sunscreen is truly clear with no white cast at all. It's also hydrating but not oily which is a fine balance that most sunscreens don't achieve. I have used this both under makeup and on its own with my other daily skincare products and it layers well with everything! I love the plant protection complex to help protect against free radicals as the sun is not the only thing that can damage our skin!! If you struggle with sensitive skin and are looking for a reliable everyday sunscreen I would recommend! * This daily use face sunscreen with cucumber is a game-changer! The lightweight formula absorbs quickly, leaving no greasy residue, and it provides long-lasting protection without clogging pores. Infused with cucumber, it has a refreshing, cool sensation that makes application feel like a mini spa moment. Plus, it helps soothe and hydrate the skin, leaving it feeling soft and nourished. Perfect for everyday wear under makeup or on its own, this sunscreen keeps your skin protected and feeling fresh all day. It is an absolute must-have! It's incredibly light on the skin, absorbing quickly without leaving any greasy or sticky feeling. The formula offers broad-spectrum protection, so you can trust it to keep your skin safe from the sun all day. Plus, it has a refreshing, cooling effect upon application, making it feel like a mini skin-refreshing treat. Perfect for anyone who wants reliable sun protection without the heaviness!

*Product was received as part of an educational promotion* * It quickly caused contact dermatitis. Severe redness and burning for days. 
My dermatologist had recommended this brand but looking at the reviews some people are very irritated by it. * I use under my foundation! I love the fact that it's not cakey! * Im very acne-prone & sensitive and this product works great! Its lightweight. I apply daily after my moisturizer and it works as a primer too. Make up goes on super smooth. I love it! Glad I found it. * This is perfect! It is basically a moisturizer, it leaves my skin looking dewy and feeling so moisturized. I use it before my makeup and i love it * It is on the more greasy side, but what I really dont like is that it pills on itself on subsequent, post 2hr mark, re-applications. I will use it up because I don't like to waste products. But would not repurchase."

36,vacation,shake shake spf 50 mineral milk face sunscreen,pimprod2044960,2623029," * Very greasy and the scent is overwhelming * I do like this product a lot more than their regular SPF lotion. This makes a perfect base for makeup while still getting your sunscreen in! The cons definitely do not out weigh the pros. The price is iffy but i would say worth it. Also no whitecast!!! I am a pale girl though so im not sure how this would look on darker complexions * The formula is great for my sensitive, acne prone skin; however, the fragrance in this product is a big no for me. Its so strong to the point that I cannot stand the smell. Unfortunately because of this I won't repurchase, but otherwise it's a great mineral sunscreen * I love Vacation's body sunscreens so much, so i was very excited for this face sunscreen. The only thing i like about it is the packaging. Their retro branding is to die for, and the shaking is fun to do. Unfortunately this leaves an awful white cast on my pale skin!! It makes me look purple. Not only that, but when i am patient enough to sheer it out, my skin itches about midday, specifically my forehead. Maybe im allergic to an ingredient. It's just so upsetting, but no, I really would not recommend this to anyone. I hope they try again. * I love the Vacation line of products and when I saw this sunscreen I was eager to try it! My only complaint is that it leaves a white cast on me, which I do not prefer when it comes to sunscreens for the face (hence my leaving off one star). Wound up returning the product. * I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily and this product is light weight, smells great, and leaves my skin silky smooth with no residue, it soaks in my skin nicely! I'm impressed and will purchase again! * Would buy again on sale only lol"
37,supergoop!,triple prep weightless multitasking moisturizer spf 40 face sunscreen,pimprod2043911,2620576," * This is my fIrst review. I have spent thousands on skincare for fine lines and milia. I have had lasers, injections, etc. This cream has completely erased my fine lines and almost completely eradicated years of milia around my eyes. I have my best friend hooked and I will never purchase a different cream. With that being said, it is not for sensitive skin. In my experience, anything that is this effective is not going to be gentle. I do not have sensitive skin. I can feel some burn, but no redness or reaction. I am 48 and I now have my skin back from my early 30s. I only wish that i would have had this then. * I haven't had any issues with this product besides the fact that it has a pretty bad smell to it so it's not enjoyable to put on. * I was super excited to use this moisturizer as it had SPF in it. But I am utterly disappointed. It caused severe eye irritation that i had to go see an ophthalmologist. No sunscreen has caused me such reaction so i was worreid. However i do think it's a good moistirozer with SPF but its just not for me. * This moisturizer initially feels amazing on the skin, and it worked well under my makeup. However, after a few hours, my eyes began to burn and sting! It happened on 2 separate days so i know that it is this moisturizer. Again, i really wanted to like this but it really irritates my eyes. * This is a really great SPF moisturizer. It really holds up to its name. I've been looking at this brand for months and finally got it. I've only been using this for a little under a week but this by far, has been the best SPF moisturizer I've EVER used. Someone who works at Ulta said this was a really great product; she was correct. What sold me is when she said it holds up really well for people who have oily skin, which is an issue for me so I have an issue with products that make my skin extra oily. This is very lightweight and worth the money. I just need to see how this holds up with this FL heat. * I thought this was the perfrct match for me as i am lazy and hate having to layer moisturizer with an SPF and get greasy quick. This dries down matte at first but within an hour or so is super greasy and makes my face very shiny. For the price I expected better. * I tend to find most sunscreens to be greasy, oily, or sticky even when they claim otherwise. I assumed this would be the same especially since its a sunscreen moisturizer combo. However I was wrong!  The texture and finish is so so lovely. It's very lightweight and glides on nicely, moisturizes without leaving me feeling like a shiny greasy mess! It's perfect under make too. Highly recommend!"
38,coco & eve,tan boosting anti-aging body oil spf20,pimprod2044325,2623610," * Im on the hunt for the best tanning oil and previously I tried bali body, however today I layed outside for an hour with this nice smelling oil and I believe I tanned better. Im yet to try Maui Babe, but from what I have came across this is a great tanning oil im just not sure if its the best considering the price. * Love this product. Works very well. Good for fair skin or skin that burns easily. * Love this oil!! It created an even tan while moisturizing my skin beautiful. In love with the smell. 

Cons- not water proof and cap cracked and disintegrated with the heat and oil. * The packaging is beautiful but it's glass and that is kind of pain to handle. It's VERY VERY oily. It's a slick oil like the Hawaiian Tropic oil. So you cannot touch anything or sit on anything besides a towel once applied. Have only tried it once and it maybe gave a color boost but nothing too crazy. Would probably love it if it were more of dry oil. It's a little pricey for just a tanning oil with an SPF. Many other products out there that do that same for less money and more ideal packaging."
39,vacation,instant vacation browning lotion spf30 body sunscreen,pimprod2043686,2620523," * It's not terrible, but I wouldn't recommend it. It stained my clothes and it did not spread easily. * I love Studio Tone and was hoping I'd like this similarly. Idk where people are getting chocolate and other claimed scents here. Mine smelled metallic in a way that turns my stomach. Faintly and vaguely like fish blood on a dock? The color was really nice and I thought I could still wear it further from my nose on my legs or something. However the color transfers really badly as other reviews mention. Not worth the trouble. * Bronzes your skin beautifully, but the color transfers to literally everything, even after its dry. Works better if you mix a little with a regular sunscreen, but be prepared that it will end up on your bathing suit, towel, etc. I wanted to love this (I am very pale and loved the idea of looking tan while giving myself sun protection) but the color transfer just doesnt work for an active vacation. * I thought this was a. Sunless tanner (my fault) and b. Transfer proof (their fault). It was nothing of the sort. The color you get after a mildly difficult application (if you don't have a tanning glove, don't bother) is GORGEOUS. But don't…touch…anything. It stains everything. What exactly is this for??? * Every good review has to be fake. It smells like sunless tanner i checked like 3 times because i was like why do i smell like that…. And it definitely stains anything it touched like who thought thisnproduct was a good idea … ruins the whole brand name * I cannot recommend this browning lotion with SPF as it stains everything with which it comes into contact. I have used another browning lotion that left a temporary stain, but I could not get my towel, bikini, or bag clean after using this one. (The straps of my bag and the areas where it touched my body and arm are now forever stained.) I didn't think this one was going to make a mess since it actually sort of dries down on the skin. I was very wrong. It left an enormous mess everywhere. I do not recommend you use this unless you are wearing brown or black and you use a brown or black towel and bag. Just don't buy it. * There is a lot to be desired when it comes to this product. It has a very liquidy consistency and does not spread evenely, and then it will stain anything it comes in contact with. On top of that, I developed an awful case of hives across my body. Usually I love vacation products, but this one was not it."
40,sun bum,daily 50 body lotion,pimprod2043280,2619925," * Wanted a light,non greasy spf lotion for hands and arms. This is a winner. Smells nice but can't smell unless I put my hands to my nose and I prefer it that way.  Have bought Sun Bum spf lip balm in the past and always loved it,now I can add their spf body lotion to my favorite list of products. * I use this product every single day. I've bought at least 5 bottles this summer. Its a true holy grail. Its not sticky. It never ever pills. I love how smooth,soft and well protected it makes my skin feel. Very comfortable. It leaves begind a soft,dewy sheen. I have not burned once while wearing it. It's excellent for use anytime you're not in/by the water. (You could, but I would use traditional sunscreen for that.) It smells amazing as all Sunbum products do. That fades rather quickly so it doesn't interfere with perfume. I do wish this product were available in a larger size,but at least it's in a pump. * I have sensory issues that make me more sensitive to how products feel on my skin. The vast majority of sunscreens feel sticky or greasy in some way, but I push through those feelings because wearing sunscreen is extremely important. Enter this sunscreen. SPF50, pleasant to apply, and NOT GREASY AT ALL! I would love if this formula came in different sizes so I can travel with it. Sun Bum nailed it with this one! * I am super surprised that this lotion is as good as it is. Im really picky about my choice of sunscreen, well let me tell you this is a high quality moisturizer for me and I've been using it each morning! My skin feels great and it protects me, I haven't been sunburned since using it. I reapply if I'm outside working and sweating, so make sure to do that! Yes I recommend, I'm already ordering a 2nd bottle, you get a lot of product for a low price compared to others on the market. This works as well as, or better than prestige brands, IMO. Its non greasy and actually moisturizing too! Really happy i took a chance on this one. I live in Southern California and the sun is always out, so wearing sunscreen is not an option! * Love the scent and how easily it applies (like any typical lotion).  The pump is amazing - loved it for putting lotion on me and the kids before we left the house.  Everyone would comment on the wonderful beachy scent (banana/coconut). * I love this sunscreen! It's not too greasy, easy to apply, and protected me from sunburns. Smells amazing too, just like summer. * While this absorbs super fast and is very lightweight, after being outside for an hour and a half, I still burned. I use the regular SPF70 all the time and swear by it but I won't be using this particular product again. I think it's great as an everyday moisturizer with minimal sun exposure but if you are spending any length of time outside, use the regular sunscreen. Don't be a tomato like me"
41,supergoop!,daily essentials spf starter kit,pimprod2036549,2603598," * It is a great way to try a product but honestly not for everyone. I have combination skin and found myself disliking the sticky, heavy feeling. * The setting mist bottle does not spray. It is 30 minutes to my nearest Ulta store to return. Frustrating purchase! * I live on an island and absolutely don't leave the house without sunscreen, but I've never found a product that I loved for my face until now. I have combination skin and Unseen Sunscreen has become my new daily. It is smooth as silk and feels identical to Smashbox primer, if you've tried that. It absorbs almost immediately but leaves my skin soft and ready for makeup, but I think it blurs well enough that l dont need makeup (I'm in my 40's). This little sample tube has lasted me two weeks of daily use and it's finally running low. I use an amount the size of my index nail and it's enough for my face, neck, and the backs of my hands. I read some reviews questioning the SPF value, but they seemed unfounded and I wonder if those reviewers were using authentic product. 

Yesterday I went out boating for four hours and I relied only on this little kit. The Refresh spray was nice for reapplication, which I only remembered once, halfway through the day. I didn't get burned at all, even under these harshest conditions. 

The Play Everyday lotion was fine. It worked well and I definitely would have burned without it, as I missed a few spots and am absolutely fried. It just doesn't stand out above other sunblocks to me. 

Nonetheless, I'm very happy that I ordered this kit. These aren't cheap products but the quality is excellent and I don't skimp on skincare. This kit allows you to try each and see how your skin responds before investing in larger sizes. * These are so small they should be free samples. I haven't even used them yet, but I should have looked more closely at the size before ordering. The price is way too high for these tiny bottles. You will basically get one or two applications with each. * I have bought this twice and it is such good value and it lasts a while. * I love this product but the bag (a big asset on why I bought this set) is an ok sized bag that feels cardboardy. The sizes of the products are pretty reasonable. The ""Unseen Sunscreen"" is very soft and silky. None of the products leave my skin with white cast or oil and grease. My skin feels amazing after using this product. I would recommend this set or even the full size of all these products. Over I would recommend this! * Cheap way to try 3 sunscreens! Loved both the lotions but wasn't a big fan of the spray. It felt greasy."
42,e.l.f. cosmetics,suntouchable all set for sun spf 45,pimprod2039944,2611368," * This is my experience, yours may be different. I'm 57 with combo skin and wore this over makeup for my son's wedding. After sobbing, laughing, dancing, sipping, my makeup held up pretty well. I began to use just over moisturizer and it seems to protect my skin. I'm now using for working outdoors and it holds up to a sweaty brow pretty well, doesn't irritate or dry out my skin, and it even has a slight smoothing effect? When using alone, I spray into my hands and pat it on, and even spread on my hands. It makes my hands look younger. It's convenient and the nozzle doesn't clog like regular sunscreen. I wish it came in a larger size. * Smell is strong, can feel it on the skin and burns eyes with any little contact. Not makeup friendly, even when used with setting spray * I love this sunscreen for reapplying throughout the day. The nozzle is great as well. It delivers an even spray and is not hard to push down. * Hard to say how much this helped with keeping my makeup on since the sunscreen definitely left a greasy/slippery film on my face, but it did offer some sun protection. Do not, however, use this if you're wearing any eye makeup. It had my eyeliner & mascara sliding all over my eyelids & I had no idea. I used this two days and even used an eye primer the second day thinking it would help. It was worse. Lol * Very strong smell and very irritated skin smells like alcohol. Give me an iron infection from using this product. I returned it immediately. * DO NOT BUY THIS!! at first try nothing usually happens till the next time you try it!! I dont know if the chemicals or ?? But the itches doesnt stop!! My whole chest area, throat area ,and face has been itching for days!! * Other than the smell I would say it's a good product, easy to use and it lasts forever hahaha, but, the smell is something that really bothers me, specifically because it smells like nail polish remover, and because you spray it on your face it feels like you are putting nail polish remover into your noose and it's annoying."
43,sun bum,face mist spf 45,pimprod2021621,2575599," * burns if it gets in my eyes - kinda itchy. * While this sunscreen can look a little on the greasy side if you overdo it, adding the right amount can turn a bare face kind of day into a clean girl day instantly * Why make a face spray that when people spray it on their face it burns their eyes so bad they can't open them for 30+ minutes?! * I bought this wanting a misting sun screen with a higher SPF that I could spray over my makeup during the day. DO NOT USE THIS WITH MAKEUP! It made my mascara and eyeliner run like CRAZY! On top of that, the scent was extremely strong and every time I would use it, it would burn my lips. This is the case with any Sun Bum product (for me anyways); sensitive skin around my eyes, nose and lips would burn HORRIBLY. If you're sensitive to achohol and fragrance STEER CLEAR of this product. * My best friend sprayed me (whole body! Not just my face!) with this at an outdoor festival and I was in love. It smells like bubblegum to me ans mists smoothly. I use it as a travel sized spray sunscreen for everywhere. I have very sensitive skin (everywhere) and feel like this didnt break me out. * I was excited to find a ""face mist"" that i could spray directly onto my face. Alas, you shouldnt do that with this product. It also irritated my eyes after I got wet in the pool. * This reeks of rubbing alcohol and is one of the main ingredients. Returned."
44,coola,scalp & hair mist organic sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2012274,2561108," * This product is great. It keeps my scalp from burning. The scent isnt horrible. The only thing i dont love is how my scalp feels when i put it on. Kinda like hairspray but tacky too. Overall i would recommend this product. I have bought multiple times & made some family buy too! * Love this product.  Reliably keeps my scalp from burning with just a few well-placed spritzes.  Herbal smell dissipates quickly, and I'm careful to avoid spraying too much so I don't get greasy hair.  Also works as a quick SPF spray on neck/shoulders in a pinch. * The actual SPF in this product works well for my hair and scalp, but tell me how is this a sunscreen bottle and the paint on it MELTS when it's in a bag that's hardly even in direct sunlight. The bottle constantly leaks as well, and the scent can be nauseating, especially when it spilled all over other stuff in my bag. * I have androgenic alopecia and Tellugen effluvium. I do not always want to wear a hat/scarf/wig,especially while swimming. I definitely no longer wear swim caps as they are too hard on my delicate hair. This product protects my scalp under some very thin patches. It smells amazing. Herbal but fresh as well. The scent dissipates rather quickly. The mist is a pump and it is very fine and consistent. if you are careful with placement and apply evenly it will not become greasy. My hair is very thin,if it's greasy you are using too much and you are spraying on the hair not the scalp. Maybe get someone to help with application if this is happening. Anyway, my scalp has not burned all summer and I have started using it on my whole family. It's pricey,yeah,Coola isnt cheap,but it's a very high quality/performance product line. I will repurchase this and the spf setting spray for a long time to come. * I am so disappointed in the product. It turned my bleach blonde hair so brassy!! Blondes beware! I just hope my hairstylist can fix the awful color this stuff has turn my hair. * I was trying this on at the store and before I sprayed it on my scalp some of the liquid got on my  finger it burned my finger and left small little cuts * My girls and I all have parts in our hair that get blistered when we are outside. We took this to the beach last weekend and tried it - all of us got blistered AND the product made our hair really disgusting afterwards. Hoping to return and refund."
45,vacation,shimmer oil spf 30 sunscreen,pimprod2045400,2623027," * I love this product really good for summer glowy look. 
I love the smell it is not super strong or overpowering.The texture and the consistency of the product is great. The shade is really good.  You can use it as stand alone or you can mix it with you lotion or moisturizer just like me .The packaging is so cute. 
It blends very well its not drying and it is hydrating to my skin. Its not harsh as well and stays all day .
I like the ingredients pretty decent in my opinion. The quality is good for the price. Definitely will recommend to anyone . * The vacation oil is hydrating and left my skin looking beautiful. My skin looked so dewy and glowly. Its gave me a beautiful sun kissed glow. It applies smoothly to the skin and it is not patchy. It looks very luminous. I like how it has SPF 30 so it protects my skin from the sun. It contains coconut oil, jojoba oil, marula oil, and argan oil. The scent is very warm like coconut and pineapple. It is their signature scent in all of their sunscreen products. The scent remind me of a summer day on the beach. The product is like liquid gold. It has hints of shimmer and glitter which looks stunning on the body. The product is not greasy at all and feels comfortable on my skin. I love it and would recommend it. ""This review was collected as part of a promotion"" * like this product. It has a nice smell and pretty shimmer. I wish it gave more of an oily glow and lasted longer. I like that this has spf and isn't greasy. I wasn't worried about this staining my clothes because it dry down well. The packaging is nice and looks like an expensive perfume which is very nice for sitting on the vanity.

Product layers well with other fragrance and fragrance oil and on top of itself. I think this will definitely last for a while and compared to the price I would say it's worth it. Really great beach product or added touch to an outfit. Definitely a summer time staple and the product being a 2n1 is really appealing. I like vacation brand and I think they super innovative and this product is just another example of their great brand. * I love this highlight oil! Is stays shiny for a very long time. The smell is seductive and wonderful. The highlight is amazing. I've gotten so many compliments wearing this. It is my spring/summer new favorite! I need to buy another just in case they run out of stock. All the good stuff always go fast!!!It's smells amazing and the glow is beautiful I super love it I love this highlighting oil it leaves you feeling smooth and silky and smells wonderfulThis highlighting oil is perfect for summer. It makes my tan legs, arms, shoulders, and my favorite area the neck line glisten. It's lightweight, fast absorbing and not sticky. I love the peach scent. Makes me feel ready for summer. Compared to a competitor brand I use its very luxury in texture and presentation! * Vacation Oil
My name is Lacey, I'm a licensed cosmetologist of 18 years, and I have a serious obsession with beauty products of all kinds. Reviews are always the first place I go before buying a new product, and I'm here to share mine. As we know, SPF is the most important and most popular additive when it comes to our skincare products. Over the summer, I was lucky enough to test Vacation's shimmer oil with SPF 30, and it had me feeling and looking like a golden goddess.
Usually, applying SPF is a painful experience for me. I don't like it! Vacation took away that pain with this luxurious oil-based shimmering sunscreen. Made with coconut, jojoba, marula, and argan oils, its scent smells amazing without being too overpowering. Jojoba oil is my favorite ingredient here, and I use it often for its beneficial properties. It contains vitamin E that can do everything from boosting collagen, helping to diminish fine lines and wrinkles, while also improving your skin's elasticity and providing extra hydration. 
This product glides on your skin so silky and smoothly, without feeling super greasy or looking greasy. It spreads evenly, and a little really goes a long way. This oil feels like it actually penetrates your skin, giving you added moisturizing properties that other SPF oils do not offer.
Now the best part - the shimmer! Not too much, not too little. The tiny gold specks sparkle beautifully in the sunshine without overdoing it. I received so many compliments at the pool - noticing the shimmer and the scent. Sexiest legs ever. Overall, it's truly a beach girl's dream product.
Vacation shimmer oil makes applying sunscreen actually enjoyable. It's obvious that Vacation puts so much thought into their products to really make them stand out from the ordinary. For example, the little ball they put in the bottle to make sure that it's mixed properly before application- to evenly distribute that glittery glow. I really appreciate that little ball!
If you enjoy tanning and laying out, you need to have this product in your beach bag. Without a doubt, I'm giving Vacation Shimmer Oil a 5-star rating and I highly recommend it to all my fellow beach bums out there. 
Just get it. I'm confident you'll be thanking me when you do. There's nothing not to love about it. * My name is Jessica & I'm a 37 year old avid beauty enthusiast. The Vacation Shimmer Oil is THE LOOK of Spring & Summer & will keep you shining when the sun goes down in the Fall & Winter! The product packaging is super lux. I absolutely love the rippled cap and the fact that it's in a clear bottle which showcases you the beauty of the actual product. Both the bottle & product gives you that Bahamas vacay feeling all 4 seasons!  I like to glow all year round and this is now my holy grail. It makes my skin feel buttery soft and it gives me that perfect sparkle. It's water resistant for 80 minutes & 30SPF which to me is mind blowing after growing up in the 90s baby oil craze. It also blends seamlessly and doesn't leave a white cast like most sunscreens do. It leaves my skin with this gorgeous golden color. It smells of coconut & banana, mixed with a little pool water. The smell is absolutely divine. I mean what a dream.. vacation!! * The Vacation Shimmer Oil is THE LOOK of Spring & Summer & will keep you shining when the sun goes down in the Fall & Winter!

However, I was very disappointed when I applied the sunscreen and there was an obvious white cast. I have medium-tan skin and this product is meant to be brown-girl friendly, but is unfortunately not. * Pros: 
-No offensive smell
-Moisturizing
-Layers well under a powder foundation

Cons
-Can be a little too slippery
-Sometimes the coverage feels uneven
-Does not layer well 
-Goes slightly orange on my fair cool-neutral skin
-Would prefer higher spf * I am a chocolate woman and this product always leaves white cast * After wearing this I broke out, after my skin cleared up i tried it again and the same thing happened. I do have oily skin so and this made my skin even more oily so maybe people with dry skin would be better for this. The packaging also isn't great. I couldn't get the product to pump out so I had to untwist the pump and get the product out that way. Overall would not recommend or purchase again. * On my skin it leaves a whites cast and peels off and i recived it as
The birthday gift from ulta. But very moisturizing * I got this for my bday freebie. I started using it this morning & really love it so far. I'm also a glasses wearer & they have not shifted on my face at all. I've got oily skin, so there's some shifting throughout the day."

50,black girl sunscreen,moisturizing sunscreen lotion spf 30,pimprod2021860,2577186," * Black girl sunscreen lotion SPF 30 is god, just that, my face is already shiny and it makes my face more shiny. I need a matte sunscreen lotion. But over all, it's good. * I've been loving the sunscreen for I want to say two years now. Me and my daughter have used it many times. I've used it in the most crazy weird climate like Wisconsin to scorching hot or humid like Vegas, Arizona and Mexico. It has never fail me!! * Best sunscreen for black skin! Apploes well and not oily! * I tried this product because I have very pink skin and the white residue looks really terrible on me. I will say it does leave no white cast. However I do not recommend it because while it did a great job of protecting me from a burn, I got a tan while using it which means it is not providing adequate protection from UVA rays that cause tans but also skin damage and wrinkles. Also I got acne allover my body after using it. * I like the way my skin feel after I put it on. Not too greasy * No white cast and layers well over my other face products. Also moistuizes well. * No white cast and layers well over my other face products. Also moistuizes well."
51,vacation,chardonnay spf30 lip oil,pimprod2043687,2620560," * This line is so cute and i wanted to love this lip oil, the applicator is perfect, the bottle is perfect and even the scent is pleasent. The only thing is it taste like sunscreen way too much i cant get past it, the oil is an oil so it doesnt stay on the lips long like a gloss which is fine and i did feel like it didnt make my lips feel soft like after a moisturizing gloss. Your lips are protected from sun damage i did notice my lips were brighter looking. 
Biggest take away is that flavor is too strong and not in a good way * i really love this lip oil for days in the sun! looks nice on and love the texture and packaging. a lot of complaints here about the scent/taste but i actually like it lol. maybe test in store to see what you think of the fragrance. it does have a bit of a sunscreeny/chemically taste to it so i understand why some may not vibe with it. my only complaint is that it absorbs so quickly i feel that i need to reapply it often (probably better for sun protection anyway) * I'm shocked, as someone who has liked the other products I've tried from Vacation. I can't really believe this made it through product development and got greenlit. I applied this 4 hours ago and I still have such a strong sunscreen taste in my mouth that I can't get rid of no matter what I drink. Why make a lip sunscreen product that tastes like you sprayed chemical spf into your mouth? * I have mixed feelings about this brand as a whole, but I do really enjoy this product. It does give you the sun protection you're looking for the applicator is nice and large and the smell is pleasant and mild. The product is much more of an oily consistency as opposed to a glossy consistency so it absorbs and disappears rather quickly. If this product could improve in any way I would say having a couple different tinted shades would be nice with more of a gel like consistency that way it can be worn as a gloss. * Smells nice, very gourmand but has a thin texture rhat doesnt moisture lips and tastes like sunscreen. * I really wanted to like this product but the smell was horrendous i cant imagine having it on my lips all day * I wanted to enjoy this so badly. A lip gloss that offers SPF, I thought it would be the perfect accessory to have in the car during the spring time. Shifts around too much and you end up eating the lipgloss more than anything."
52,vacation,classic spray spf 50 sunscreen,pimprod2037342,2606405," * As a ginger, sunscreen is very important to me. After using a bunch of different spf 50s on my trip, this has stayed #1! The smell is amazing, the spray is very powerful and only needs a little bit since it goes such a long way, and it leaves a nice glow without too much oil! I heavily recommend this spf! * DON'T BUY!! Does NOT work!!!! Went camping and had the family use this spf and we all ended up burnt! I take sunscreen very seriously and this the first time with any that hasn't worked! Not worth it!! * I don't know what was in this sunscreen, but I was really looking forward to a convenient spray SPF. I put it on my forearms and neck in late morning and was put off by the scent, but brushed it off. Later that night, I noticed small, red pinpricks all over my arms. I woke up the next morning and the dots had become red bumps, and were noticeable over my neck, looking similar to acne. As of now, about 36 hours later, my arms are still covered in bumps, though they are no longer red. I have no known allergies, so I don't know what caused this reaction. All this to say, I have not enjoyed this experience, and the scent is unpleasant anyways. * I don't know if the stinging is pertaining to this product or just spray spfs in general because this is the first spray I've ever used. I used an entire tube of their spf & that one was great. Will purchase it again but the spray stings my eyes. I can barely open my eyes typing this. I spray it in my hand then apply to my face & neck. The smell is lovely. Wish I didn't have to throw it away & I can't return it as bought a while ago. My eyes hurt if I look into the light. It's just a shame as liked it. * unfortunately, this gave me a horrible (massive!) rash and the infamous scent was barely noticeable over the chemical aerosol smell. couldn't say if it actually prevented any sun damage because of how awful the redness and welts were from the reaction I had to this. * This is my new favorite spray sunblock. I like the smell a lot, it's very summery and fun. * Love the smell!"

It doesnt pill or change the texture of my makeup. Its weightless and it doesnt leave a white cast. Obsessed! Gifted by supergoop * It's good, just not worth money or intrigues me anymore. Burns eyes, makes skin slightly irritated. Wouldn't buy because there's better for sale out there. * I really like this sunscreen. I buy this size, because I think it is too expensive. * i've struggled with finding a face sunscreen for decades. i'll never look elsewhere. feels so good when it goes on (smooth!) and disappears instantly. isn't shiny, isn't matte, doesn't have any sort of cast. no weird smell. makes a great base for makeup and washes off easily."

Too expensive to be so bad. * if you want to go to the URGENT CARE wear this product... I got this product from a friend and she said it broke her out. I thought I didn't have sensitive skin in the slightest. I put this product on for a baseball game I went to, I wake up the next day and I have redness and texture around my mouth area. I thought it was just a little breakout that would go away withen a week.... NOPE! I wake up the next day and the previous redness and texture I had got worse and it have moved across my cheeks. It continued like this until it plagued my entire face. I looked like a ballon, it was so bad. I decided that I really needed to go to urgent care to do something about this because it was hot, painful, and so uncomfortable.... I COULD BARLEY OPEN MY EYES!!!! When they finally got to me in the urgent care (2 hours later) we traced my reaction back to the sunscreen I used, I have to get shots and medicine to cure this reaction. Please do your reasearch on whats in this product. * I have had this for just a few days and really like it so far! It's easy for me to apply sunscreen in the morning without getting my hands all gross. The only downside is depending on how much you put on, it takes a while to absorb in your skin/dry. * This product did protect my face from the sun, but hours after I was in the pool it was still greasy! I had to buy a travel bottle of cetaphil cleanser to wash it off! I usually use the sun bum stick, but wanted to try this item after seeing a celebrity going a GRWM video and saw them use this sunscreen! * Its not greasy and very glowy. It doesnt break me out and the stick is very convenient and leaves the skin feeling silky. * Love this product. Easy to use. Really protected my face did not burn. Would recommend this p to my friends."

This product is really greesy. You have to rub it in for quite some time and its really thick. It probably works just fine to protect my skin though. * Love the formula but it literally smells like dirty feet. The smell is so spot on that I'm assuming they wanted it to smell that way. Such a shame because I thibk the formula is great. * I have mature skin and this is bery matte and will not crease under my makeup. Love that it has zinc and mineral formula. Not scented. I live it on my chest and arms as well for daily use. I do have an oily t sone area. Ive used very expensive formulas that do not compare! This was my daughters and i used it one day and fell in love! I actually love most of their products! * I love this sunscreen. it goes on smooth, doesnt leave a white cast, and feels good on my skin. I love thats its mineral based and is spf 40. idk why theres so many comments that say it smells bad? I dont notice any smell * I love this sunscreen and will be buying again, the only downside is it smells like sunscreen and sweaty feet. You don't smell it very much once it's applied, but if you're sensitive to smells I would avoid this. * I love the texture and mattification of this sunscreen but i broke out in two inflammed breakouts after using it for two days.

They used Banana Boat Mineral sunscreen. * I see past the only con because I do love this product. I like the orange gele too but find myself grabbing for this one way more. * Love this SPF but the bottle is very small. Wouldnt buy again due to size vs price * This is perfect for the legs in summer when going outside. Feels silky not sticky. The chardonnay scent is really nice, not a strong sunscreen smell, sweet but not childlike. It gives a beautiful glow and enough sun protection for being outside under an hour (need higher spf for the beach). * I really love this oil. I have light skin and its very moisturizing and it does help me tan and not burn. Smell is great and feels great on skin. I wouldn't wear light color bathing suits though as the color does get on swimsuits and coverups. Also the packaging is horrible. Leaks everywhere. Wasted quite a bit of product due to leakage. I have to double zip lock baggie it to keep it from going everywhere. Please change packaging to make it less wasteful."
58,kopari beauty,sun shield soft glow daily face spf 30,pimprod2038378,2605239," * I loved everything about this except my face burned everytime i used it. * I do like this sunscreen, some people complained it was oily.  I have oily mature skin and I like the way this feels.  You do need to shake it and mix the properties together after sitting.  I only wear a tinted moisturizer, no foundation, so I don't know if that makes a difference. It does not feel or smell like sunscreen to me. * The last bottle I bought was thicker. The new bottle is a thinner consistency. Not sure if they changed the formula. I do like the coverage and wear it daily under make up. It leaves a little iridescent glow under my make up. * Just started using and my skin seems to be responding well. * Feels like heavy silicone on my face, clogs my pores, and just feels gross. SPF 30 isn't really high enough for sun protection either. The ""glow"" was barley visible on my light-medium skin tone. * I have medium brown, dry skin and once its set its not oily at all. I love the glow it gives but if i sweat it will get in my eyes and burn but not as bad as super goop play. I love the murad more but this is my go to on days im staying inside mostly. 

Arizona has extremely high Uv index all day, i would not use this outside again or near water. Anywhere you will sweat excessively . Its very light and comfortable but its better as a inside spf or driving spf. * I liked the gel full body version so much that I went back and bought this face one, a travel pack for myselfs and my sisters and a full size of the 50 spf for my mom. It's dropping a lil bit now to save face later. Skin cancer runs in my family (with 2 grandparents and 1 parent having chunks removed from their face and body).... So I am obsessive about avoiding it. I'm not going to get any pretty missing part of my nose lol. This stuff glides on smoothly on top of other skincare products. Make sure your face is dry enough. I don't want to scratch it off my face immediately after applying. It's high allergy season where I live so can't comment on the smell."

It's greasy and seems to separate when squeezing out of the tube. * This is one of my favorite sunscreens. It leaves a beautiful matte finish. It works just as well as any high end product. The thing is, it sucks as a primer. It pills with EVERYTHING. Gel products or anything hydrating do not work with this. I only use it alone. * This is the best Supergoop dupe I have found. It feels just like Unseen Sunscreen. * I looooove it, just get it girl. I have extremely sensitive acne prone skin. Like I cant even touch my face or I'll break out type of sensitive. This protects my skin barrier and does not clog my pores 🫶 it leaves a very smooth finish and is literal perfection paired with my double wear foundation. It does not get too oily nor too dry its perfect I have an extremely oily forehead and very dry flaky cheeks and chin but I dont have that issue with this primer. Just get it and thank me later!!! * It is a great sunscreen it goes on smoothly and is just very protecting. It goes on like a moisturizer in my opinion. The only thing is that you HAVE TO shake it before you use it. * It is a great sunscreen it goes on smoothly and is just very protecting. It goes on like a moisturizer in my opinion.

I will be purchasing it all the time.  It's like my skin is lit from within. * So...gooey and sticky!! Visibly washes off immediately with water contact, even if you wait a good amount of time for it to set. I had really high hopes for this being a Kopari product but the quality is just...not there. Incredibly overpriced at that. * Doesn't matter how long you let this ""set"" , you can immediately watch it wash off when you get in the pool. Gel is thick and hard to spread. * Great tanning oil. Not greasy. Love it! * I live in Salt Lake City and am outside for several hours most days. I use a bike for transport so start my day with sunscreen which I re-apply several times through the day. I tried this as I find most sunscreens to be incredibly drying. This soaks into my skin nicely and my skin is more nourished than it has been for months. It is spendy but I am super happy with it. * I will say, this did not provide the glow that I wanted it to when applying, but what a GREAT sunscreen. I've been using this at the pool at summer and It stays on even after a quick dip and doesn't smell trashy. I re-apply every two hours and have not burned once, and still come home with a wonderful suntanned-glow. * This stuff is very pretty and also goes on very easily, but do not use it by itself if you do not want to get burned. Definitely put on sunscreen first and then this on top so you dont get fried in the sun (like i did)"

As soon as you use a towel/rag to soothe your eyes a minute later they'll start burning again. This can happen for hours. Wanted to love this because it doesn't leave a white cast if you rub it in enough, but the eye burning isn't worth that. * i bought this in store at the beginning of summer after an employee recommended it to me. i'm a natural redhead, so im pretty pasty and prone to skin cancer/burning easy. i was hesitant because it was super pricy - but a little goes a long way!!! i work outside in the sun all day and have every day for the summer, and i havent burnt ONCE since buying and actively using this. i still have over half the bottle after 2/3 months. it is so worth the money. * I really wanted to like this BUT I've used it a few times and for some reason, after about an hour, even though I'm not sweating, this sunscreen starts to get in my eyes and even my mouth! Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation. It has Benzophenone in it, which can cause contact  dermatitis. I get an allergic reaction on my eyelids every time I've used this product. * OMG this is the best sunscreen I've found for my skin, it's refreshing and soft and doesn't leave your skin white or thought of it. I loved it * Goes on white but leaves no white cast on brown skin after rubbing it in. I love how the spray disperses the product evenly. I dont recommend using it on your face directly though. Steep price for an average sunscreen. * This sunscreen is great. I have very oily acne prone skin and this rubs in well and does not make me greasy at all unlike other sunscreens."
62,coola,piÃ±a colada classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 30,pimprod2012272,2561103," * I am loving COOLA right now. This SPF is perfect for this dreadful Texas humidity and heat. It's very lightweight, non-greasy, and has a pleasant scent. Reapplying is a breeze since the product doesn't build up on the skin or cause a film. It's very breathable and works well with general skin sensitivities. The size is quite large for travel, but still small enough to throw in your beach bag and still have space for other necessities. It has a click-locking spray top so it doesn't accidentally spray in your bag. I will say that if your skin is very dry, you may want to go for a cream SPF because this does not provide much moisture. This is definitely made for hot, sunny summers. I love it and I know for sure I am buying a full-sized bottle to keep on hand.

***This review was collected as part of a promotion.*** * As a professional in the beauty industry, I've learned firsthand the  importance of sun protection, making COOLA's  spray an indispensable asset. In an industry where skincare is very important, COOLA stands out with its dedication to not only protecting against harmful UV rays but also enhancing the overall experience of sun care.

COOLA's sunscreen spray doesn't just shield your skin from UVA and UVB rays; Its broad-spectrum protection ensures comprehensive coverage, safeguarding against both premature aging and potential skin damage. As someone deeply invested in skin health, I love COOLA's commitment to providing a product that protects and cares for my skin.

The scent of Piña Colada fragrance is delicious. Gone are the days of sunscreen smelling like, well, sunscreen. Instead, COOLA's tropical scent transports me to my last vacation. It's a big change from the clinical smell of traditional sunscreens, making the application process a sensory experience.

I did not have any issue in my delicate skin but I always recommend  a patch test.

In my personal opinion, COOLA's in spray isn't just a sun protection product; it's an  evolution of skincare. With its comprehensive protection, anti-aging benefits, and irresistible Piña Colada scent, COOLA has redefined what it means to stay safe in the sun. So, whether I am lounging by the pool or hitting the beach, I make COOLA my go-to companion for summer adventures. And a big pus smells delicious! * The COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a delightful sun protection experience. Its tropical scent evokes visions of sunny beaches and relaxation, enhancing the application process with a touch of indulgence. The organic formula boasts SPF 30, providing reliable protection against both UVA and UVB rays, crucial for preventing sunburn and long-term skin damage. What sets this sunscreen apart is its lightweight texture, which absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. This feature is particularly appealing for those who dislike the heavy feeling often associated with sunscreen application. The spray mechanism ensures effortless and even coverage, making it convenient for reapplication throughout the day, especially during outdoor activities. Furthermore, the use of organic ingredients adds to its appeal for those who prioritize natural  products. 

 In conclusion, the COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a luxurious and effective sun protection solution for those who appreciate both quality and indulgence in their routine. * As a licensed Esthetician, we our taught early on how important using SPF to protect our skin. This aerosol is easy to use and smells amazing! If you have sensitive skin I would recommend spraying into your hands first then applying. I did have a slightly burning feel when I sprayed directly. But, overall I really love how cute and small and effective this spf is to use. My skin adapted the more I used this spf. * I love this sunscreen! Its perfect for travel and smells great. I used it almost all up on my recent vacation. It smells likea tropical holiday on a beach with a coconut. I would definetly recommend. I know the spf is quality and better packaged and easily portable. * This review was collected as part of a promotion. My name is Michele and I'm a Beauty Expert in my early 30's with fair combination skin. As the weather gets warmer, I have to make sunscreen a priority in my skincare routine. I am absolutely loving the Coola Clear Spray Body Sunscreen SPF 30 Piña Colada Sunscreen. I love its yummy, natural Piña Colada scent. It takes me away on a vacation to my favorite beach. This is a non-aerosol sunscreen that is so easy to spray onto your skin. It has a lightweight, lighter than air, mist texture that absorbs so quickly into my skin without leaving any greasy residue. I got the chance to try the full size 6 fluid ounce version of this spray sunscreen. This sunscreen is formulated with at least 70% Organic Ingredients. You get broad spectrum SPF 30 UVA and UVB protection. This sunscreen has water resistance that lasts up to 80 minutes so you can enjoy more time in the sun and water without worrying about reapplying every hour. With this amazing sunscreen you not only protect your skin but keep it hydrated too. Plant Protection is formulated with antioxidant rich nutrients which help fight free radicals, hydrates and nourishes your skin barrier too. Safflower Oleosomes is plant derived encapsulation technology that makes this formulation even more effective. Spray this sunscreen on your skin 15 minutes before any sun exposure. Make sure to reapply this sunscreen every 80 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone of any age who loves the sun and wants to have lightweight, long lasting and fast absorbing sun protection that also keeps your skin hydrated too. * Sun care is very important because it can help prevent skin cancer. I can't stress enough how important it is to wear sunscreen everyday. I was looking for a new everyday sunscreen and I think I found it. I prefer spray sunscreen than a cream so this one is perfect. It smells absolutely amazing and I love it! With most sunscreens they can get really heavy and greasy. I was really pleased that it absorbs really well on the skin and doesn't leave a layer of oil behind. Another thing I like is the ingredients, because I was having a hard time finding sunscreens that didn't have harsh or harmful ingredients. The Coola brand has organic and vegan ingredients so no worries about having harmful chemicals being absorbed in your body. So far so good and I would repurchase it."
63,neutrogena,ultra sheer lightweight sunscreen spray spf 45,pimprod2032286,2595099," * This is an all in one product. I use it during the day for the sun protection and the glow it gives. You want to spray generously and not skim out on it. The scent is also not too overpowering. * Just no * Beautiful not greasy I buy this over and over try it you won't be disappointed * This gets everywhere oily. You absolutely cannot use it inside or your floors will be slick. I still burn reapplying this too. * Wore this, let it set, and got in pool. 15 minutes later I was blue from the pools paint. This thinned it, removed it, and stuck it to my body while destroying the pools paint. * It was working okay but after 3 weeks of using it almost everday I started to develop rashes. They were circular (kinda likr cigarette burns) reddish, and flaky. They get itchy sometimes. I know it is this product because this is the only new one I've used. Now I don't know what to do with all these rashes and skin damage I've sustained. * Great hand spray type top instead of those one finger kind of press button things. The hand grippy spray allows for easier application in hard to reach areas."

It leaves me with a light glow which I really like. I don't wear makeup so I'm not sure how it sits under foundation. * I love all Tula but unfortunately, this pills on my skin & it separates in the bottle so I've got to shake it and I lose some product each application. * I love this product. When you apply it, it adds a glow to your skin. The only downside is it is only a 30 SPF. Isiah it had the option of getting a stronger one. * I was looking for a new sunscreen and decided to give this a try because other Tula products have worked for me in the past. This sunscreen gave me small red itchy bumps all over my face. My skin looks horrible now! * Love, love, love * I wanted so badly to love this because i really like the brand. However, the formula is chunky and oily (like a lava lamp). Then once i applied it, my skin was peeling, dry and just gross."
66,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen body spf 40 invisible sun protection,pimprod2038031,2606364," * I do really like this sunscreen- it's like a clear gel with a velvety finish (think primer consistency). It's rather expensive though for what you get- considering it's a body sunscreen, this wouldn't even get you through a week at the beach. * No matter which supergoop I try they are heavy greasy they do block the sun but feel horrible * Me gusta mucho, no deja la piel grasosa, te da brillo y protege * Absolutely terrible! I broke out in a rash about an hour after using. Theew it away immediately! * I love the OG unseen sunscreen for my face and its the perfect texture and viscosity. I was hoping this would be too. I hate the lotion texture of others so i was really excited that SG came out witb this. The only problem is that its just oily… it absorbs well and makes my skin feel REALLY SOFT but since i do sweat pretty easily it can feel a bit slick at times. Maybe its the olive oil in it? Or its just too many oils. * Goes on like silk and absorbs quickly. * This is a unique sunscreen. It slides onto my skin without an oily feel and immediately disappears like water. I like working in the yard. The Unseen Sunscreen Body enables me to be outside without getting a tan or sunburn in this hot summer sun. Other brands of sunscreen have felt oily and were a bit difficult to apply without some effort. The Supergoop! spread easily. It was a delightful surprise!"

This was very white but rubbed in and absorbed well. Dries down quick to a soft powdery feel which is so beautiful to the touch.  No smell, did not irritate my eyes, did not make me break out which is amazing bc I'm sensitive and it's just so light feeling on my skin. My skin looks grade and I absolutely love this! * Loveit * I liked this when I would run because  it doesn't run into my eyes when I sweat but it has an awful white cast and I'm very pale. Does not rub in all the way no matter how long you massage it and is pretty greasy. * Pill , white cast and drying * In my personal experience, with this sunscreen i would say that all the pros that they stated above the reviews, are not true at all. They gave me bumps and a rash, that still have not gone away in over a week. I would not recomend this to anyone who has sensitive skin, because I don't have sensitive skin and it gave me an allergic reaction. * If you are remotely melanated, this is NOT the sunscreen for you (unless you don't care about white cast). Even after rubbing this in really well, the white cast doesn't go away. I do feel like this does a great job preventing sunburn, though. * I really wanted to like this product but it made me smell horrible for days somehow despite saying it was unscented and it left a white cast on me that was extremely hard to blend in. After sweating, you could see the white cast build up more and I was constantly having to rub the sunscreen in."

I'm thinking because i had another face product that caused it. * I've been looking for a good moisturizer with SPF and this has been my favorite so far. It smells amazing and makes your skin sooo smooth. The only thing I don't love is that it makes your face oily. I've started to use a light powder over top of it and thats solved the issue. Give it a try! * This supergoop pruduct blends and moisturizes your skin so essily!

71,la roche-posay,anthelios uv correct spf 70 daily face sunscreen with niacinamide,pimprod2030180,2591831," * This sunscreen is sheer and I like it very much. Sadly, it's one that creeps up into my eyes and burns. * This is a hard review to write because in a lot of ways its exactly what I'm looking for: moisturizing, has spf, gentle. The big reason I wouldn't buy it again is it melts into my eyes and stings terribly. Ive actually had to pull off the road barely able to keep my eyes open another second with a waterful of tears (product induced— not weeping) making the whole situation worse. It must not happened to everyone, which is why I gave it for stars. It just doesn't work for me. * I think this is the BEST spf ever!!! I'm 42 and have always had dry skin and I absolutely love this SPF.  It's not oily at all, I know some are oily/greasy but for me it's buttery and zero white cast. My skin feels so nice and hydrated and wears so nicely under makeup, zero pilling.  I've used it for a few years now and if I try something new, I always find myself coming back to this. Highly recommend!! * I bought this product after seeing an influencer rave about it on IG whike using it under her makeup application. Worst results ever. I used it a couple times on my trip to the islands. Went out and applied it before applying my primer, makeup and doing regular routine. The whole time I'm outdoors I kept wondering why my face feels like I'm in a sauna. It made me sweat so much and my face felt greasy and more oily. I then tried the same routine without this product and realized it was this that affected my change. Never buy or use again. * It left too much of a white cast for me to want to continue to use and was difficult to smooth across my skin. * I have light-medium oily skin and live in a dry climate. This sunscreen blends well, but leaves a dewy shiny finish; so much so that even matte foundations can't cover it and my skin gets oily within a couple of hours. * Did not like this product. I have some what sensitive skin and it stings so bad!!! My sister tried it out as well and it did as well for her."
72,la roche-posay,anthelios kids gentle sunscreen face and body lotion spf 50,pimprod2037033,2608258," * It looks horrible on my skin. I have used it on different occasions and it always happens the same. Don't waste your money. * By far the best sunscreen out there! I used it daily for a 3 week trip throughout Italy during a heatwave and didn't get burnt despite me being fair as can be and outside the majority of the day. Will always buy again!!! * I purchased this product because the ingredients list showed that it did not include Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene. However, when I received the product, this sunscreen does include these ingredients which are NOT reef safe and is banned from parts of Hawaii. Will be returning. Please update the ingredients to include everything."
73,neutrogena,purescreen+ tinted mineral sunscreen,pimprod2037357,2606100," * Over the summer I wanted a tinted sunscreen to wear in lieu of foundation. I love that this is affordable, comes in a variety of shades (I sometimes mix them) and evens out my skintone while giving me sun protection.  I am in my late 50's, and not into high fashion cosmetics at this point of my life. But i am into quick makeup that looks natural, and this does the trick (although i still use an under eye corrector).  Some people say its oily. I feel like it gives me a dewy glow. Younger people may not like it, but its good for my generation whose makeup can look cakey due to drier skin. You have to shake up the product before applying which can be messy.  I've found that if I take off the lid and put my index finger over the hole while shaking, there's no mess (a finger keeps the product in the bottle better than the lid does). Also, when traveling, I put a small piece of plastic wrap over the hole, then screw on the lid. Pain in the butt?  A bit. But i like the product so I'll deal with the packaging. * I bought this product to make my morning routine easier, but it applies so oily and runny  that I need to be careful when handling the packaging and applying on my face. It's unwearable without setting powder and the product leaks everywhere. I bought a Medium shade but I'm really a light Medium and it shows that it's not the right shade. * Love the shade range and doesn't break me out or dry me out. * I really wanted to like this.  I have fair skin (120 in Fenty) and the light shade worked well for me.  It might be a tiny bit too dark, but it's so sheer that the color blends away and doesn't leave a line.  This has essentially no coverage, even for a tinted moisturizer so don't expect even light coverage with this.  I could deal with that and just use this as a sunscreen if it were not SO OILY.  It remains tacky and shiny even after letting it sink in for half an hour.  I am in my 40s and have very dry skin.  My skin is so dry that I use face oil with my moisturizer at night so I never thought I would say that a product is too oily.  I thought that my summer daytime moisturizer might be too heavy to use with this tinted moisturizer so I tried it without my normal skin care on bare skin the second time I used it.  It's still a greasy mess on my dry as the Sahara skin and the oil never sinks in.  The tint rubs off and leaves a mess if anything touches your face.  I just don't understand the reasoning behind a greasy, tinted sunscreen with no coverage that leaves color on anything that touches your face. * The sunscreen itself I enjoy and is great for my sensitive skin. However, the tube it comes in, is a mess! The sunscreen is so thin, it really needs to come in a pump style not a squeeze style. I feel like I've lost half of the product already because it leaks out the sides. * 1. I only wear mineral spf - if you can do chemical - i wouldn't recommend this. There are so many elegant chemical formulas, especially in k-beauty! 
2. This stuff IS moisturizing and doesn't really dry down. great for dry skin or when set with powder- but i wouldn't recommend to oily girlies. 
3. Its  VERY runny- so make sure to shake it before applying. The packaging gets pretty messy for that reason - i think a dropper bottle would be perfect. 

I use this when my skin needs moisture, like after retinol or AHA. Im pretty pale and the tint is perfect. All universal tinted spfs are too orange for me. 

While i don't this daily, I really do like it and find it's been a staple for my dry or sensitive days. * this oily soup of a sunscreen should not be appearing in the ""CC cream"" or other searches for ulta. to say it's tinted is a farse, it is slightly in appearance to be non-white. it is also the oiliest, runniest cosmetic I have ever encountered. I have dry skin and couldn't even absorb it after many attempts at blending (which then eliminated any coverage it provided). the end feel was disgusting and greasy and it gave acne within 24 hours. also, the packaging doesn't seal well. in just one day it seeped out into my makeup bag. Just awful all around."
74,vacation,classic lotion spf 50 sunscreen,pimprod2037341,2606406," * I was unaware that sunscreen could pill. This one sure does. I am writing this review from the beach because of how awful this is. I have no idea why this got good reviews. * I used to be faithful to the Neutrogena kind until I found Vacation. no white cast, affordable, amazing juicy scent. the 6oz size lasts me all summer. I use the supergoop on my face so I can't say anything about face acne, but this does not give me body acne. I recommend this to everyone, and get so many compliments on the fragrance! * i've only used a travel size bottle of this sunscreen but i really love it for on the go days in the sun. i have never noticed it pilling and love the way it smells and feels on the skin * I dont think I've ever had a sunscreen (body) that pilled before. This goes on super thick and after a few minutes began to rub off in huge pills everywhere. Kinda gross - I wont repurchase. * I couldn't be happier! It's been a long time coming. Where to even start? The price is beautiful. The SPF 30 works. The scent is wonderful, I love vanilla and coconut. The lotion soaked in perfectly on my sensitive combo skin. I use this moisturizer when I'm going to wear makeup. And I use a lot of it! This is now going to be my go-to moisturizer. * Love this sunscreen. It's affordable and not irritating. My skin is super sensitive when it comes to sunscreen and this one is the most affordable in the market that my skin actually likes. I love the scent as well but I also hope they come out with a non-frangrance version of this formula! Formula absorbs well and is non-greasy. * Loved this for my Hawai'i trip. Moisturizing not greasy and smells great. I did get some color on my chest despite consistent reapplication. It worked great everywhere else. I am very fair."
75,bali body,hydrating natural watermelon tanning oil spf15,pimprod2043239,2619272," * This product works the way it's intended. Excels your tan, I put this only on my legs when sun bathing and I could feel the product warming up and working. Smell is great. Water resistant didnt come off easily. 
Only downside is its a little pricey for the amount you get, I took a photo of the bottle for reference and I have little baby hands. * Im so annoyed about this purchase, for some reason, no matter how many times I came back, I thought this was more then a tannig oil, I thought it also left a bronze glow. That being said, the bottle is way to small, it also says to use another spf with the product to protect your skin. Its a lovely product but for the amount you receive ans having to use another product with it, its not worth the purchase. Save your money * This product does work abaoultoey wonderul im a very pale person and rbis prsoxut has gave me rhe best tan with no burn but the bottle is really small ive only used it three times and its almost out * I bought this on a whim to try as i was desperate for any sun tanning solution and let me say this has been an unexpected winner! I used it while at a water park hoping to get my backside even and my legs to match my arms. This product has worked better then I could've ever imagined. It smells amazing, a little goes a long way, and it gets you a very nice even tan all throughout your body wherever you use it. I did go ahead and layer the product first having it as my base then a layer of sunblock and then I topped it off with another layer on top. If there was only one thing I could complain about, it would be the amount that you get for the price. While a little does go along way. I just don't know if the price offsets everything else. * The bottle is freaking tiny for 23 dollars. i shouldve looked at the ounces but the bottle just looked bigger in the picture. im not sure how good it is ive only used it once but it smells good * I don't waste my time writing reviews. But girl I need to tell you what just happened. So I am so pale, I know so sad. Okay, so I didn't want a tanning oil to give me a false tan, and ma'am when I tell YOU that I'm proud of this tan because I earned it. The oil smells so nice. I paired it with an spf 50, and I'm new to tanning and you best believe I burn easy. So when I tell you I TANNED. I feel so much better about the way I look. When I say it's only been 15 MINUTES, Jaw on the floor. Picking it up now because it is still devolving and I'm STILL getting darker. Like girl…my pasty self is getting darker? Yes…take my money agin because I'm getting another. I'm bummed I'm only getting like 7-10 uses out of it. But if it works it works. And I am working with this sun right now. Watch me be a bronze goodness by the SUMMER girl. 10/10 oil, you won't find anything better. I promise you that * I never write reviews, but i have to tell you guys everything about this. So i never bought oil before right, so i didnt know where to start. I was so afraid to burn or get a fake tan too like the other products. Oh my gosh guys, this oil works so well. It smells so good too. It doesnt give you a false tint or anything before hand and it will activally make you proud of your tan. I always hated fake reviews from insta or tiktok, but i found this one by myself and im so surprised it woked so well. Im super pale, and i never go out. The way it tanned me in one session..flabbergasted…immediately. I feel so confident. I pairded it with a spf 50, and the oil.  The oil gave me such an even and bronze tan. Its still forming curently. But this is within 15 MINUTES. Im so dispapointed the bottle is so small for the price. It will give me 7-10 sessions. But honestly its be worth it."
76,vacation,studio tone spf 50 bronzing drops for face,pimprod2044961,2623028," * Maybe its because I have oily skin but this made my skin feel so gross. I mixed it with my moisturizer like I do the drunk elephant drops and this makes me feel like I had a MASK on. It was heavy, sticky and oily. The color was decent and it's cool toned with no shimmer but that's where the positives end for me. I had to wash this off my face and start over bc I couldn't stand how it felt. * I would give these drops 10 out of 5 stars if they fixed the packaging. I love the design but the serum ends up on the thread of the screw top of the bottle when you try to neatly put it away. I dislike losing little bits of the serum to the lid, it's messy. The actual formula & package graphic art is amazing. I also have 40s skin & the formula is forgiving & looks nice on my normal to dry skin. * I love this so much! I hope it never gets discontinued. I have dry skin so I layer this over my moisturizer. Works great alone or or with a full face of makeup. It is such a thin formula it's almost more of a serum, and it takes so little to cover your face and neck. So lightweight and non-greasy you forget you're wearing it. Also smells amazing and the packaging is really cute and nostalgic. * I wanted to love it but when I apply my face stings and then I get dry itchy blotches on my face after…so I mean if you don't have the sensitivity it can be a great spring/summer or even daily spf staple but not for me unfortunately * easy to apply, even buildable bronze, glowy, smells nice * This is the bronzing drops I've been looking for. They really compliment my skin and I am obsessed. I feel like this really works with my skin tone. This is the first face bronzing drops that work for me. I wear this under my tinted SPF. * I was hesitant to try this because most bronzers have either been too dark or orange. This product is perfect for me. After a week at the beach, I struggle with makeup because my body is much more tan than my face. This has given me a perfect tan and glow using it on its own. As my tan fades I will try blending it with my makeup. An added benefit is the spf. In love with this product and would highly recommend"

Best of all, it does not burn my eyes!!  I apply it alone to my neck after serums and moisturizer but do mix with my foundation when I apply to my face. * I was given the sunscreen by my mom try, but after a few weeks of using it I notices it made my skin extremely dry. It also caused my make up to separate even when allowing 15 minutes to dry before applying foundation. I've increased my moisturizer usage hoping that would help offset the dryness, but it has not helped at all. This sunscreen has an odd smell to it. * I've had such a hard time finding a face sunscreen that didnt mess with my skin or makeup and this is it! I'm obsessed with how easy it is to apply after my skincare and it was no issue at all with my makeup after application! It doesn't have a typical sunscreen smell. I will say, for someone like myself who had oily combo skin, this might be a hit or miss for you, but for myself personally I didn't mind it at all :) * My sister-in-law got this and I've always wanted to try it and have it my own and I love it 😊 * Smells terrible and goes on like flaky paste. Overall gross feeling. Very dissatisfied. * I've tried countless sunblocks, most of which caused me breakouts and I usually hate the way they feel on my skin or smell. This one is my GOAT.

It's super gritty and feels scratchy when you're blending it on your face. * IMO this is almost an exact dupe of Natura bissa's sunscreen tint which is $100+ & I cant bring myself to buy it (I've only had samples). This product leaves your skin super dewy and lasts. I live in colorado so counteracting the dry climate is first & foremost in my skin care routine. This product does the trick! * Overall moisturizer is pretty good  , it is definitely more suited for those with dry skin. Can be a bit greasy for anyone that has oily or combination skin. easy to use. It is nice but didn't work with my makeup products. offered by drunkelephant * This stuff glides on and doesn't leave a chalky mess behind like many mineral sunscreens.  I put it on after my moisturizer and all my makeup goes on perfectly.  I wish I had found this sooner. * I have been using the new Umbra Tinte mineral cream for the last few days and I am so disappointed. It sits on top of my skin, causing it to crease and make my fine lines stand out, it leaves tan smudges on my clothes or anything that happens to touch my face while I'm wearing it and it makes my skin look shiny and greasy. 
I'm genuinely disappointed given the reputation of this brand and the many positive reviews. I understand we all have different preferences but I can't imagine anyone actually being happy with brown stains all over the collars of their shirts and a face that looks greasy. I'm returning this tube tomorrow and buying Super Goop, as I had originally intended. * I have rosacea and get itchy bumps from Vanicream, Blue Lizard, Elta MD, etc, - basically all sensitive mineral sunscreen brands. This is the ONLY sunscreen that causes no reaction. I love it and it makes my skin look good, I do not wear foundation and wear the pink tone one as I am fair. * I thought the deepest shade would work for me but applying the product feels like a physical exfoliant and the white cast is an awful orange."
81,la roche-posay,anthelios uv hydra sunscreen spf 50 with hyaluronic acid,pimprod2043464,2620128," * It has taken me forever to find this unicorn—no stinging eyes (even during exercise), lotion/thin consistency, absorbs quickly, makeup lays well over top, and spf FIFTY! I wasnt good about wearing sunscreen because I couldnt find the right product—until now. So happy! * This is a good product, it is totally invisible and VERY hydrating. It pairs well for me while I use tret since it is so hydrating. However, it does sit on the skin as VERY oily. But it doesnt break me out and is light, so I'm leaning towards this being a good product that I will probably rebuy. * Sunscreen works well. It's lightweight and blends easily. Plus it's not greasy which is great. My old facial sunblock would get so greasy when out and about in the sun, this one does not. * Wanted to try it and and its me new fave. * Yes, it really is invisible! I have acne prone skin and it does not break me out. This is my favorite sunscreen to date! This is the first La Roche-Posay product I've used and it's making me want to try more! * Painfully dry lips, swelling in cheeks. Never had a reaction to an SPF quite like this. * I'm not sure if its the ""dewy finish"" or whatever, but this sunscreen is very oily on my skin. It feels like a layer. However it is invisible which is a plus."
82,vacation,classic spray spf 30 sunscreen,pimprod2032500,2595586," * I used this sunscreen recently at an amusement park and it was 90s the whole time. Good news is that I didn't get burnt but I felt sticky the whole day. It was pretty uncomfortable. I would buy again if there was a dry touch option. * Unfortuately this product pilled a lot and was not sweat resitant for me. Dissappinted :( * perfect sunscreen for wandering the city, hiking, just sitting outside, not greasy which is so major, smells unique in a good way * I was excited to try this based on all the rave reviews. I guess the smell was ok. After getting out of the water, I found the product turned into a white film. Also pilled with reapplication. Can't say if it was effective against burning because I switched to another brand mid afternoon due to the pilling. * Vacation products are ALL great. I have them all! The sprayer works great, the smell is amazing, I've seen mixed reviews complaining of the ""strong smell""..that is the whole point, the ""Vacation"" smell, if you want non scented buy non-scented! * Amazing smell, no sticky residue left behind * Spray button was very hard to push 
Had to use both hands awkwardly to spray in my hand and apply"
83,supergoop!,daily spf starter set for face and body,pimprod2044980,2624465," * It gave me a really bad white cast and I was left looking like Casper the Ghost. Also, it broke me out and blurred my vision a bit. After a couple of minutes, I noticed that my skin was turning red. It was so bad that I had to wash it off. * Used 2 for gifts for my daughters teachers and kept the 3rd for myself. It feels so weightless on my face, no grease and great coverage. A recurring buy for me"
84,vacation,super stick spf 45 face stick sunscreen,pimprod2044959,2623030," * I don't hbderstand all the good reviews. Maybe I got a bad batch. It did not glide on easily, you have to apply pressure so if you're wearing makeup it will get messd up. It also leaves my face feeling sticky to the point that my hair sticks to my face. It feels like I put a gluestick or Chapstick on my face. * I like the easy application, and the light scent. * For future buyers the stick is actually mostly full of product. The 1/2 inch mark is simply the divet in the product that is there for shape presentation, the rest of the bar is sunscreen that is usable. FYI! The reviews mistake this for the full bar but it is dense enough and contains enough product to last long, about 3 inches long. * Although the stick is small, the consistency is firm enough and solid so that you can get a lot of use out of it. Just make sure it doesnt get in your eyes. * My only critique is that the packaging itself is fairly small, meaning not as much product as i predicted. But it works well nonetheless. * This product is cute, works well and smells good. The size of the container was as expected and makes it super portable, but the amount of product was disappointing. I probably wouldn't have even realized how little product there was in the tube, but when I first opened the tube the product fell out exposing how much was really in there. I'm talking about a half an inch worth of product in the 3.5 inch tall tube… The packaging clearly says 0.7 oz, but you don't realize how little that is. * found this and said oh perfect! needed something to keep in my bag for sunscreen on long motorcycle trips. this is a great size teardrop shaped stick that goes on smooth and clear, smells really nice and light. definitely would recommend this to everyone! packaging is also on point ☝🏻"
85,coola,classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 30 tropical coconut,pimprod2030786,2592674," * Coola clear sunscreen is awesome I live the smell and also love how it doesn't make your skin feel greasy or leaving you with a white hue! The packaging is gorgeous and I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone! Everything about this product is awesome. * I absolutely loved the COOLA Tropical Coconut Clean Sunscreen Spray SPF 30! The scent is a dreamy, beachy coconut that instantly transports you to paradise. The formula is incredibly moisturizing, leaving my skin feeling soft and hydrated without any greasy residue. It sprays on evenly, absorbs quickly, and provides great sun protection with its SPF 30. I also appreciate that it's made with clean ingredients, making it a great choice for everyday use. Whether at the beach or running errands, this sunscreen keeps my skin glowing and protected. I  will definitely be using this all the time here in sunny miami. I'm so happy I discovered this great spf to add to my skin care regimen. This product was gifted as  part of  an educational promotion. * The COOLA 30 Clear Sunscreen Spray in Tropical Coconut is a summer must-have! It feels super lightweight, absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave a greasy finish. The tropical coconut scent is subtle and refreshing. Love that it's reef-safe and packed with skin-nourishing ingredients. Perfect for everyday sun protection! * The COOLA 30 Clear Sunscreen Spray in Tropical Coconut is a summer must-have!

Perfect for everyday sun protection! * avobenzone is not reef safe. this brand is full of lies and marketing. beware!! * Not sure why this is advertised as a coconut smell it doesnt smell like anytbing which was very disappointing. Purchased this product for my son who hates wearing sunscreen i thought that if he liked the smell he would use it but no it doesnt smell like anything i sprayed and sprayed and no scent of coconut so definitely not repurchasing * I have been using coola products for years! I love the products. Good quality! Love the smell of the scented ones."
86,blue lizard australian sunscreen,sensitive mineral sunscreen lotion spf 50+,pimprod2043682,2621976," * Love this product. Great fir taking to Carribean as it is safe for the reefs * I'm a red head and I can't even ride in a car on a cloudy day without sunburning. This stuff works so well. Most sunblock doesn't work more than 30 minutes on me but this lasts for hours. I've been using it for years. So thankful for it!! * I really wanted to like this but I didn't. The main thing was it left a white cast on my skin. No matter how much I rubbed it in or let it set, nothing. I also wasn't a fan of the scent or the viscosity. * I purchased this thinking that it had great sun protection due to the brand. The bonus was that it's a lotion, 50 spf and formulated for sensitive skin. Tried it, got burned, skin is now sensitive and itchy. The cap makes it very messy to dispense. * Just got back from 9 nights in Cancun, and I'm tan with no burn at all thanks to this stuff! Unlike most white mineral sunscreens, this one actually soaks in & leaves no cast on your skin. It also feels super moisturizing and keeps you from burning! * Just bought this to tan. A lot of other sunscreens will still have me leaving (slightly) burnt no matter how many times I re-apply even if its before the recommend time. But with this sunscreen, i tanned out in the sun (under the amount of time before i needed to re-apply) and i didnt burn even a little!!! Very effective and works well, but it really does leave a bad white cast which is the downside because the white cast is very noticeable and doesn't blend away. I also find this sunscreen to be very greasy compared to other's but it doesn't bother me as much as the white cast does. * It's so oily and leaves a huge white cast. It's terrible."
87,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen spf 40,pimprod2029930,2589386," * I like this product didnt really have a problem with it, its just that i dont like how it feels on my skin. As someone with combination skin it would leave a matteish finish but after a few minutes i wouldn't see that matteiah finish and my glow would comeback. Some people like that glowy look but its just not for me because of my skin type and my preference. Good product just not for me. * I like this product didnt really have a problem with it, its just that i dont like how it feels on my skin.

Some people like that glowy look but its just not for me because of my skin type and my preference. Good product just not for me. * The Ulta Unseen Sunscreen SPF 50 which I received complimentary from Supergoop feels like a primer yet has the protection of a sunscreen.  I love it because it is beneficial for my skin as it diminishes pores and allows for smoother makeup application.   The formula is unique and stands out because of its performance.   I highly recommend especially for traveling and busy days. * This is my all time favorite sunscreen. It is so great for everyday and using underneath makeup. It doesnt pill or change the texture of my makeup. Its weightless and it doesnt leave a white cast. Obsessed! Gifted by supergoop * It's good, just not worth money or intrigues me anymore. Burns eyes, makes skin slightly irritated. Wouldn't buy because there's better for sale out there. * I really like this sunscreen. I buy this size, because I think it is too expensive. * i've struggled with finding a face sunscreen for decades. i'll never look elsewhere. feels so good when it goes on (smooth!) and disappears instantly. isn't shiny, isn't matte, doesn't have any sort of cast. no weird smell. makes a great base for makeup and washes off easily."
88,kiehl's since 1851,better screen uv serum sunscreen spf 50+,pimprod2042679,2617292," * I've been looking for sunscreens everywhere!! Luckily I tried this when I was shopping for the moisturizer. 

Feels so plump on the skin, doesn't leave a white cast, makes my skin glow, and I've never felt so confident in my skin while it's sunny out! 😍 * Was looking for a sunscreen that is good for day to day in all seasons, this is really nice, goes on smooth, no white cast and leaves skin very glowy, definitely can see wearing makeup on top of it once dried fully but I have not done that yet. * I grabbed a sample/travel size of this sunscreen in an emergency and have been wearing it daily for the past week. The serum spreads easily, and helped my skin stay moisturized throughout the day. But the finish felt greasy and looked shiny on my skin. Worst of all, it seemed to worsen my already very congested skin. I notice more closed comedones at the end of the day thsn usual when I wear this SPF. * Pretty much all sunscreens give me an eczema rash. I like this one because it does not - unless I apply it more than 2x/day that is. However, it makes my skin super shiny, oily feeling, and it clogs my pores .. A LOT. It's all about trade-offs though. I would rather be protected by a high SPF sunscreen that doesn't make my skin miserable and itchy and just deal with the breakouts. Not sure I would really recommend this though. * In love with this product - great sun protection, without feeling like a typical sunscreen. No heaviness, chalkiness or skin discoloration. * This product is seriously the sunscreen product I have been searching for. I have been using Beauty of Joseon Sunscreen for awhile now and it is great but I still felt that it was too heavy for me. I love this product because it is lightweight and just melts into my skin like butter. I have dry, very sensitive skin so I think it was just what I needed. * This is the sunscreen I have been searching for. It rubs into the skin so easily. It does not pill or leave a white cast. Its very moisturizing as well. It gives your skin a subtle glow. It does not overly burn your eyes either if some gets into them. It lays great under makeup. I spent a week in Florida and i used this daily and my face/ neck DID NOT BURN.
I love this product!"
89,blue lizard australian sunscreen,sensitive mineral sunscreen spray spf 50+,pimprod2043671,2621975," * Not only was it effective, I didn't get that sticky,  gnarly feel on my skin, nor did it make my skin break out. Really great stuff. I would definitely recommend it to friends and will certainly be purchasing this product again. I was extremely pleased with it. * I really wanted to like this more. I love spray sunscreens but this was a waste of money. The nozzle stopped working after just a few uses. * I don't usually leave reviews, but I was super disappointed in this one.  The nozzle stopped working almost immediately, I didn't even get one leg fully covered before it clogged up.  Luckily I had a backup lotion with me. Other Blue Lizard products have been great. * I would say this product is a firm no for me as I PERSONALLY experienced a minor allergic reaction on my arms and it made them really itchy with small bumps. I had high hopes it would work fantastically as it's mineral with high spf but it's unfortunately a no for me :( * I love Blue Lizard's other products, but the spray nozzle stopped working only after a couple of sprays. * Sirays on so easy. Applies with minimal effort to rub in after spraying on. Has the most mild scent out if all the products, probably due to the application process. It wirks so well. Full day of baseball camp, and my son had zero burns at all. Just a beautiful tan. Highly recommened this product. * I bought this for a trip to Maui with my husband. The bottle looks to be a decent size - a little smaller than your average spray sunscreen container. The product itself worked well. There was a slight white cast but it wasn't bad. It felt like it was stuck to our skin (in a good way) and definitely protected us from the sun. HOWEVER... The bottle literally lasted  us 2 applications each, so 4 full body applications total! And we are relatively small people. Is this a joke?? Good thing that was all we needed for our trip, but that's DEFINITELY not worth the money. Such a bummer!"
90,kinship,self reflect probiotic moisturizing sunscreen spf 32,pimprod2017785,2569946," * This is my absolute favorite go to for every single day. All other ""sheer"" tinted sunscreens or moisturizers are too dark for me. This has just enough for lightweight, fair glow. Applies and blend easily with fingers. Love it. * I wanted to love this but it leaves me feeling oily and greasy all day instead of moisturized. I also dislike the way it makes my skin look. It's way too expensive for me to not love it completely. I will say that it doesn't break me out which is a pro and hard to find with sunscreen * this is simply the best sunscreen i've ever used. i have incredibly sensitive skin, and this has never once irritated or burned my skin at all, even after i've used a retinol or a stronger active. it's also the only sunscreen i've ever used that has never once irritated my eyes! i can rub this around my eyes like a full on eye cream and there's no burning or watery eyes. it feels and applies just like a moisturizer (very hydrating and dewy) and there's no sunscreen smell at all. i've gone through two full bottles of this and it's never made me break out or irritated my eczema. truly cannot recommend enough. * This sunscreen is spectacular. I am acne prone and have sensitive skin, but this does not cause any issues. I usually avoid fragrance in my skin products, but don't mind the mild vanilla scent. This leaves such a nice glow once settled. I always come back to this spf when I try to branch out and try new products. Nothing compares! * I was lucky enough to get the sunscreen on sale and try it out. Otherwise it is a pretty pricey sunscreen. I was worried about trying it out because every single time I've had anything with SPF it made me break out. Idk what it is and as a reference I have super dry skin. I dont get much acne or breakouts unless my skin is unhappy with a product. Finally I found an SPF item my skin approves of. Hopefully you get a good sale on it! * I really like this sunscreen, because it's cruelty-free, gentle, & NON-water-resistant.  I have used it on my face  over cruelty-free spf30 moisturizer, my arms, & legs.  It has a pleasant vanilla smell & uses tumeric & other gentle ingredients.  I was disappointed in the expiration date, however, & returned it.  Will order another one online to hopefully get a better exp. date.  I recommend it highly! * I love this sunscreen! It is one of the only ones I've tried that doesn't break me out. I have normal, but dehydrated skin that is fairly sensitive and acne prone. The zinc oxide in this sunscreen really helps calm redness and irritation in my skin and is somewhat hydrating whereas some sunscreens I've tried for acne prone skin were too drying for me. I used this for years and decided to try other sunscreens, but I ended up coming back to this one as others i tried just didnt compare."

92,neutrogena,clear face oil-free sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2021433,2576185," * This is a good sunscreen if you have really oily skin. It absorbs quickly and is quite drying. It has silica in it which makes sense. I have combo skin so this leaves my skin dry which is why it is not for me. However I saw a lot of comments about pilling, this sunscreen has silicone in it to keep it oil free. Be careful when using this to not mix it with water based products that is why it pills. Or let it sink into the skin completely before applying other products. * This sunscreen seemed like a great option, but it pills really bad. I just put it over my moisturizer that I use every day and it had made my foundation come off in little balls. * This doesnt leave any cast on my skin OR pill off when i apply it! I purchased because the one from La Roche Posay pills up on my skin and can be a little tricky under makeup but this is a cheaper and better alternative in my opinion * The Nutreogena Clear Face Sunscreen definitely did it's job. It's not to cakey or greasy feeling after it's applied. It rubbed into the skin well and didn't leave that white ghostly residue. This lasted a while. With swimming I did have to reapply it more frequently. It's a nice consistency. The size of the bottle is perfect to throw in your bag for on the go. I loved that it was oil free. I had no issues with breakouts after using this multiple times. * Did not work well for me. Peels and does nor rub in easily. * This is the only sunscreen I've used in my face that didn't make me break out in white heads, and is one of the few that doesn't leave a white cast on my skin (I'm black). It does tend to sting my eyes if I've been wearing it for awhile and have been sweating, but it's easy to prevent if I don't apply any directly under my eyes, and if I only use a small amount on my forehead. The eye burning is literally the only issue. I'd rather that than a breakout or look like a pasty faced clown lol * this sunscreen doesnt cause breakouts in my highly acne prone skin. i also have super oily skin and this sets in my face pretty matte, with zero white cast. some days it can be flakey under makeup but make sure to moisturize good and it looks good under makeup"
93,avÃ¨ne,mineral tinted compact spf 50,pimprod2020808,2577170," * I do like the quality of the compact and the creamy texture made it easy apply.  I also was very pleased that it has SPF.  However, the color is a bit darker than I thought it would be.  I would only purchase again if it was available in a lighter color. * This is thick and immediately settles into any lines and wrinkles you might have. The lighter shade has a bit of an orange hue on my fair/light skin. It looks just awful. It might have good sun protection, but I wouldn't want to wear this around other humans who can see my face. * i love avene and have gotten their liquid tinted moisturizer in europe which i love but this is a miss for me. it highlights every bit of texture and dry skin i have. there are way better powder foundations with spf. i wosh this was just liquid * The US packaging does not include the expiration date, unlike the packaging back in Europe. I'm unsure why. The product is thick. I don't use it as a standalone sunscreen. I use it as a touch-up throughout the day. * It is rare that I leave a review since being experienced with so many products I have tried many tinted SPF that do not last and that  feel so greasy. It takes a lot to wow me, I've tried IT cosmetics, Dr Jart, Mischa, Supergoop etc. this is the best * Quality product . Easy for application * I have large pores and oily (summer) and combination (winter) skin, I have try so many skin tint spf product and this one felt the most comfortable. Blend well with one fingers and nice coverage when blend with the sponge that came in the compact. It also hold pretty well throughout the day, especially didn't budge around the nose area when i'm wearing glasses. The only biggest con is that the shade range are quite dissapointing."
94,coola,dew good illuminating serum sunscreen with probiotic technology spf 30,pimprod2030633,2591991," * I love the consistency of this product. I wanted to love this. But it gave me cystic acne :( * I love this sunscreen, it is everything the elf halo glow wanted to be. This is the only product i have used that clears my acne without being a true acne targeting product. It has the most beautiful radiance, and is very lightweight. Once the product is starting to run low, though, the pump becomes hard to use. Other than that is perfect. * I loved this product so much I repurchased another bottle. It gave my skin a soft dewy glow. The formula must have changed between purchases because I developed an incredible itch on my face and neck which included a bumpy rash. I eliminated all current products I was using and added back in slowly and much to my chagrin this was the culprit. If you have sensitive skin, beware. If you don't,  go for it! I am still disappointed I cant use it anymore. * I absolutely adore this sunscreen! I dont like to wear foundation, so this gives me the perfect dewy base without feeling trapped or heavy. * I could NOT recommend this sunscreen more. I've repurchased several times now, and I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear it. It's lightweight but moisturizing, the perfect glowy base for makeup (but also beautiful on its own!), smells luxe and divine, and has the perfect amount of SPF for everyday use. But while the product itself is incredible, I think the packaging needs work. I love the glass for sustainability reasons, but once the product starts to run low, it's incredibly hard to get the pump to work. I can visibly see that there's plenty more product in the container, but the pump won't retrieve it. Once I get to the end I have to unscrew the pump and use a tiny spatula to get the last of it out. This sunscreen is pricey, so I'm definitely trying to get my money's worth here, and the packaging makes it difficult to do so. It's not enough to stop me from buying it because I love this product so much (and I am PICKY about sunscreen), but I do hope COOLA sees this and makes a change soon. * I got a sample of this product from Ulta and had a horrible reaction to it. I got hives, my face was so swollen and red, and I was itchy. Definitely do a swab test if youre going to use this product, and give it time to react (I didn't react until about 8 hours after putting it on). * This is the second summer I've been using this sunscreen and I love it! Has protection and makes you glow. I always get compliments on my skin when I wear it"

The formula is non-greasy, hydrating, and includes ingredients like glycerin and rice bran extract to support the skin's moisture barrier. With water and sweat resistance for up to 80 minutes, it's a reliable choice for outdoor activities. * Bought this to fill 3oz travel containers for an upcoming trip. Super easy to fill the containers with this. The smell is so nice! Feels light and not thick or goopy on my skin(despite the name). I really love this product however it is very pricey. * If you have acne or a meduim to nromal skin then dont buy!! Made my face super oily and kinda has a weird minty feeling when applied. I did not enjoy this experience. * This product is so expensive, but i think it can be worth it. I admit it is a little sticky on my face and skin, but that never bothered me. I dont have oily nor dry skin, I glow with this sunscreen on, i put it on before my makeup and it hasnt messed with the application. It doesnt clear my skin, but i dont break out from this product. I burn easily, yet I lathered up in this sunscreen ONE TIME in the morning during a very hot summer, laying exposed under the sun all day at the beach without reapplying and i left with no burn lines or nothing. However, Im unsure about how water resistant it is. The sunscreen is easy to apply, it rubs in so smoothly. Id recommend buying in store because when I ordered online once, the seal was leaking and i had to exchange it, so i would not risk it. While i do wish this was a bit cheaper for the amount of product i get, i havent bought from another brand since i got on this once. On top of that, i love the fragrance of it, it doesnt have that typical sunscreen smell to it which is a bonus. Overall, i havent had an unpleasant experience with this product so far!"

They will happily apply and re-apply this like any other moisturizer. My husband also doesnt mind reapply this even at work. I took my most recent jug on a bachelorette trip and we all left glowing without sunburning. * Really happy with this sunscreen so far! Usually my least favorite part about sunscreen is how oily and greasy I feel and look, but this one dries/absorbs really nicely so I do not look like I am shining/oily from the sunscreen layer.  I also haven't had any issues with staining on clothes, which I have had issues with other sunscreens. * This sunscreen is fantastic!

It makes your skin glow very nice! * First off, I LOVE the way it smells!! Originally I was apprehensive about the price (especially since it was my first time trying it) BUT it spreads well with a small amount, it's a decent size, it has just the right amount of shimmer and it absorbs into the skin quickly so once it's applied, you'd immediately forget it's even there if it didn't make you sparkle. Honestly, no complaints about it personally. However, if you have oily skin that breaks out easily and you plan to use it, whether on your face or body, I would be conscious of that given that it's an oily substance rather than a lotion. * Love the way it smells, but It doesn't apply as easy as you'd think, it's a thicker consistency and i feel like you need to apply allot"
98,coola,travel size classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 50,pimprod2012273,2561106," * My first purchase was before changed the packaging and l'm assuming the formula too?
It was perfectly fine, I hardly got sunburn.
However, when they changed the packaging and formula, I got a bad sunburn for 3 months and I had to stay at home, to heal. After healing, I wanted to return this item, they wouldnt accept it. * I love this stuff!  It smells divine and really does its job as a sunscreen.  My only complaint is the price.  I usually wait for a sale and then splurge on this product. * I have been using this for years and it works amazingly. I am fair skinned and have had zero issues with it. Love how light it feels, and I so appreciate there's a fragrance-free option. * This sunscreen is fantastic! Love the guava mango scent! I used this while paddle boarding on the lake in my bikini all day in 100° temps. I reapplied once mid day and no sunburn! I use self tanner but this was my first big day in the hot summer sun. * I love Coola sunscreen. The spray applies well. I bought the travel size since I was going on vacation and only bringing a carry on and the regular size would be too big. I was a tad disappointed that these did not last the entire week. My husband and I were the only ones using the spray and we brought 2 new travel bottles with us, but they only made it to about 2/3 of the vacation. It would be nice if there was a TSA approved size that could go a little further. Besides that though, it had a good application that lasted well and as always, I love the scent. * Its an anazing product. Snells anazing, and definitely fets the job done. My only negative is that its a chemical sunscreen. Great for occational use, but not a daily summer sunscreen bc of that. * My husband and I had the worst experience with this product today, so I ran to the reviews to see if others had a problem with it. Sure enough, others mentioned that they burned badly & quickly when using this product. We spent 1 hour in overcast weather, me wearing a long sleeve hoodie, before the sun came out and we decided to wear our T shirts and SPF. We were super confused when very shortly afterwards, we were BURNED!! This wasn't the most intense sun either. I tried to protect myself & my husband with this product and it caused more harm than good. 0/10, don't even risk it."
99,shiseido,clear sunscreen stick spf 50+,pimprod2022854,2576053," * This is the best face sunscreen ever. I habe repurchased this over and over. The price is high but it lasts forever if its ever one sale BUY it. Ive tried so many and this is the best one for under makeup * Not very greasy. slides on easy. Be sure to get everywhere. I was in a hurry and didn't swipe my entire forehead 😆😆 and it showed. * I have been testing a lot of sunscreens since a was a kid and believe me when i say this one is the best by far ! * I've loved it, easy to go and reapply sunscreen. The down side of it was the smell of the sunscreen, i will say throughout the day its not that bad. * Absolutely love this sunscreen stick. I always keep in my purse so its my go to sunscreen whenever i have to reapply or if i forget. Doesnt feel greasy and has been really great for my sensitive skin. Will definitely be buying another once i run out! * I love this sunscreen type. Shiseido never disappoints on recipes. But this stick has way too little product to purchase at this price. I wanted it for my hands. I have the same 5.0 oz formula for my face and needed a tidy solution for regular hand application. The stick was great for a month then mostly gone. The rest is stuck in the plastic. Total tease. I would buy again if offered in a larger size. * im otw to buy my next one!!!"
100,coola,peach blossom classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 70,pimprod2012875,2561100," * I find this spray to be greasier than other spf 70 sprays I have used. The smell is definitely not ""peachy"". It has a very chemical smell to it. 

Certainly not worth the price! * Im not really a peach scent wearer but this smells perfect when i layer it with anything I wear. Also i usually hate wearinf oily stuff bc i have sensory issues but its not oily and dries fast. * Provides excellent protection. It has a light, clean, fresh, and fruity fragrance. It is lightweight and organic. * COOLA is one of my favorite brands so when I saw they had a 70 SPF I haf to try it. And it is now a constant staple i have. The smell is also nice not too fragramt  and not the typical sunscreen amell * I used this on just myself maybe 4 times and it was gone. For how expensive this is you do NOT get enough product. * Used this on my trip that had almost zero shade and in the pool. Kept me protected in the water and outside the water. No weird smell, It does leave a slight tint on the skin, just looks like a tan. Would 100% buy again * I really like this formula. It covers well and it's fragrant but not too heavy or greasy. It did pretty well in the water too."
101,cerave,hydrating sheer sunscreen face and body lotion with spf 30,pimprod2036753,2606576," * Lightweight but powerful moisturizing power! 

Minimal white cast, may take just a few extra seconds to fully blend in.

Works for most skin types, which can be helpful on group & family trips * First off, the only sunscreens I use are Korean sunscreens because they are so lightweight and do not leave a white cast and they do not irritate my eyes st all. 
I got a sample of this sunscreen from the doctors office and decided to try it out. I was absolutely blown away by it.  It did not irritate my eyes at all. It didn't have a strong SPF scent to it. It wasn't greasy, it doesn't leave a white cast and it did not ball up under my makeup.  The only negative thing I can say about it, is that it only has an SPF of 30.  
But I would absolutely recommend this. * This sunscreen is definitely my favorite! Its affordable, works great for both face and body as the product claims, and moisturizes well. All these benefits together make it ideal to bring along for travel, instead of bringing seperate sunscreens for face and body and a seperate moisturizer * I love that this sunscreen has good ingredients for my skin. Still has that kind of stiff feeling going on but I am going to try a couple other products for my face and use this on chest and arms etc. * I honestly want to love this sunscreen however the white cast it leaves is hard to deal with. I probably would have just continued using it despite the white cast because most everything els eahout it is amazing however my skin was clear and then consequently broke out after a week of using. This product is most wverything i want in a sinscreen, easy to blend, leaves you glowy, and is hydrating, while its difficult to know exactly what broke me out, ive had simular issues in the past with ceraveas sunscreens so im pretty sure thats the culprate. Its also not very high spf so maybe i wasnt applying often enough but it left me still burnt HOWEVER after applying it it will leave you looking like you havent seen the sunlight a day in your life because the white cast is so bad you just look pale. I wouldnt say dont buy this product bc theres lots of pros to it that i havent found in other sunscreens yet so honestly its a win loose with this product you just gotta pick your poison. * I figured I'd try their sunscreen since Cerave is amazing for my skin in general, but their suncare line is not for everyone. It didnt blend seemlessly as the bottle advertised, and instead I looked like unfinished pottery. * I have bought SO MANY sunscreens and hope that they don't leave a white cast. As someone with colored skin I have struggled hard with finding a sunscreen that doesn't take forever to rub in or leave a whitecast. This is probably one of the best ones I have tried! It's also easy to rub on kiddo's too, especially their face."
102,dime,tinted glow wonderscreen spf 30,pimprod2043028,2621467," * I love how lightweight this product is! Doesnt clog my pores and offers a light coverage. Great for my skin, which is fairly even with a little texture and some discoloration. Product is a little liquidy, if you use too much is gives a ghostly hue. Use less than 1 full pump and looks great and natural! * The product looks amazing on the skin and it's the right consistency and texture.  Love the glow.  The bottle is even beautiful.  But for some reason, it feels like it goes empty fast because of the pump and the container.  It's hard to get out the remaining product.  I love that it's glass because it's better than plastic, but I wonder how we can maximize the product, since it's so little in the bottle already.  Thank you, DIME, for making beautiful, clean skincare and fragrances.  PLEASE don't sell out!  Thank you!! * I've purchased this product multiple times before it was available from Ulta. It provides the perfect amount of color and blends well. I solely wear it and blush on a daily basis. The only complaint I have is the bottle and pump. Once you've used a little over half of the bottle, the pump stops working. The bottle is also glass so it's hard to get the remaining product out. It doesn't stop me from repurchasing though. * I love this product. I have paid for this with my own money and have repurchased it a couple times the untinted and the lightest tinted shade. This replaced any foundation and looks so beautiful on my skin it is a little thickers but my extremely sensitive and roscea prone skin adores this! I never write reveiws but this product deserves all the love! * I love this product. Despite being 48, I have very good skin and I don't need much coverage if any so this formula is perfect for me. Goes on well and feels nice on the skin. Very natural but dewy finish without the stickiness. Will reorder! * I really love this sunscreen. Its a very sheer tint but perfect alone or under make up. It doesnt have a scent and dries down almost matte. Not oily at all. I got shade 2 and it lools very dark for me but blended in great! It also doesnt burn my eyes! A little pricey but worth it. I have senstive acne prone skin and have had no issues! I will probably buy shade one in the winter when im super pale but shade two is perfect with a tan * I love dime perfume so I thought I'd try their skin care. 
This looks terrible on dry skin. It cakes and flakes.
I have very light skin, but the lightest tint is basically white and looks so bad. 

Please save your money."
103,good molecules,sheer mineral sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2037436,2606130," * DO NOT BUY THIS! I believe they changed their formula or something because I have been using it for a little over 2 years and since September I started having bad experiences with it. I stopped using it all winter and just yesterday tried it again because it's getting hot where I live. And it gave me the WORST rash ever all over my face and neck, to the point of me going to the ER because I could t handle the pain and itchiness😭 * i cannot believe that good molecules has not pulled this product yet. my 72 year old mother broke out with an awful allergic reaction to, what we determined by process of elimination, was this product. then lo and behold i come to ulta's site and see the low product rating (3.6 stars) thanks to all the one-star reviews that they are seemingly just ignoring. all of the allergic reaction symptoms that others are experiencing and showing photos of match my mother's exactly. she is currently using a topical steroid to help with returning her skin to normal. the saddest part is that she doesn't even have sensitive skin and has had little to no skin problems throughout her life. the red swollen itchy skin on her face that still won't go away after discontinuing use of the product has been a huge blow to her confidence. SHAME ON YOU GOOD MOLECULES EXECUTIVES. is it really worth the cash grab?? listen to your consumers and do something about this. * Ive never expericned sometjing like this with another product. The same day i put this product on my face, it gave me bumbs, a burning rash. My face was so swollen the next day and it burned so bad. * Very light weight,  perfect for under makeup * Im on my second bottle, I have combo/oily skin so I'm a bit picky with my sunscreen but I really love this one. Its not badly priced either! I'm hispanic and it doesnt leave a white cast on me either. I hope they never stop making this 💘 * Love this product because it doesn't leave a white cast. * So I went to Ulta to pick up sunscreen because I had ran out of mine that day. The store location I went to had very few face sunscreen options (like literally 4 brands in the entire store, I asked). A nice employee recommended the Good Molecules facial sunscreen and said it wasn't greasy and laid nicely under makeup. 

However, it leaves a very noticeable white cast. I am very pale and it made my face look like a corpses. It's so hard to find a good facial sunscreen that doesn't leave white cast and unfortunately this is the case with this one too!"
104,supergoop!,glow oil spf 50 dry body oil sunscreen,pimprod2042888,2617634," * Loved this product up until i wore it to the beach. Ive been using this for a year now applying right before going outdoors for short periods of time. However this past week i took it on my beach trip where i was in the sun for hours. I applied it 3x on my first day at the beach and omg, got so burned. My friends and kids who all used lotion sunscreen did not burn at all, only me. I realized this whole time it has not been protecting my skin at all. * I just had a beach day yesterday for my friends birthday. There was around 10 people that went and of all of us I was the ONLY PERSON to leave that beach without sunburn. 

We all applied spf at the same time, unfortunately we all forgot/neglected to reapply and we all went swimming in a lake. I am so shocked that i am not a lobster because everyone else is RED today and I'm usually the first person to burn as i am naturally very pale.

I am very happy with the results and definitely recommend it for when you're ouf in swimwear to have a nice glow. 

HOWEVER, it is greasy just so you know. But it still gets 5 stars because it works so well * I was excited to purchase this product since i have used orher products from this brand, however this one is the WORST! I have used it on a few seperate ocasions and each time i burned so badly! I reapplied constantly and there were a fee times i used it and never got wet; and yet it still didn't work! I agree with other poor reviews and also believe the oil amplified the burn. So dissapointed because i wanted to love it, but it does the opposite of protecting your skin despite having a SPF 50 protection claim. * The first few words on the back of this bottle are ""clean chemical sunscreen actives"" but this isnt a clean product if that's what you're looking for.

7 of the main ingredients come up as hazardous or harmful when it's scanned into the Yuka app. Octocrylene is an endocrine disruptor and once broken down it becomes carcinogenic, studies have found. Just an FYI this isnt exactly ""clean"".

It's also a bit greasy, you'll need to wash your hands after using it before toughing your hair or face. * Because the oil lays on thick, I think it takes a long time for it to settle in the skin, so it's easy to come off. I kept reapplying, but whenever I would switch sides tanning, I felt my skin burning. The oil probably rubbed off on my towel, and I ended up burnt. I should have gone with a spray since I think it absorbs in the skin faster since it's a lighter coat so to speak.

It seems to be that you can't sit or lay down for 20 minutes while it's being absorbed since it's really easy for it to come off. * I applied and reapplied and reapplied and i am so burnt after being at the beach for jusr a few hours that you would think I never applied any sunblock at all. My skin hurts and is radiating heat. My friend and i both feel like the oil was amplifying the sun rather than blocking it. She isnt red because she has more naturally occurring melanin than i do, but her skin is painful and tight as well. I wanted to love it like i do the rest of their products I've tried, but instead I'll be going back to normal sunblock. * I was so happy I found an oil with spf as I usually use coco oil but wanted something with better protection for vacation. I wore this for hours bathing in the sun and didnt burn one bit. HOWEVER, my skin erupted in tiny little bumps all over. My body skin is not sensitive and I was extremely surprised and disappointed since Supergoop is so well trusted. It took days to have the bumps go away and in certain areas i can still feel them and its been over a week. Would not recommend as it is highly irritating."
105,vacation,spf 30 baby oil,pimprod2038616,2596248," * Bought for a trip to Hawaii, packed in my carry on and met clean standards for snorkeling. * Applies on evenly and makes you looks so glowy and helps you tan so much faster. I love having a tanning oil with spf in it and not have to worry about burns. This is the tannest I've been. * I got this in my Ipsy glam box and jt was chosen for me. I usually don't buy body oils or any products for tanning—I'd rather stick with classic sunscreen and sun protection. I threw this in my suitcase when going to my honeymoon in Cancun and I'm so glad I did! It was moisturizing and also helped with SPF. A little goes a long way. * I'm a cancer survivor so I'm a little overzealous with my sunscreen sometimes, I've been trying to get a little better with that and so I got a bottle of this oil. In my mind I associate oil with tanning, I was an '80s baby, but I really like the way the oil makes my skin look as opposed to regular sunscreen lotion so I wanted to try them. I have worn this out several times now, one time I spent at least 8 hours in full sun and I got a very nice base tan with absolutely zero burn, not even a little redness. 

I was hoping that the scent would be a little stronger, it's actually fairly unnoticeable in my opinion. I actually prefer the scent of the other oil but I hate the packaging on that one, could we get the chardonnay oil in this bottle? 

Overall though I really like this product, it works well. * I love the classic baby oil. From the first use, i fell in love w it! Its non greasy and i didnt burn at all. I kept reapplying and got a nice tan from it. :) 
The smell is subtle and i wish they made a bigger jar! * I really like the entire Vacation line that I have tried. A little goes a long way with this oil and the SPF is perfect. I never get burned when I use it. It smells great too. * Tried it and it doesnt work, maybe for a short period of time but i wore it on a float trip and it didnt do any protecting, i reapplied multiple times but if its not water resistant being an oil whats the point in it. I guess use it if you just wanna lay out maybe but i wouldnt but again"
106,neutrogena,ultra sheer face serum spf 60+,pimprod2030654,2592306," * This is the least greasy formula I've tried, and there's no white cast. The serum-like consistency is easy to work with compared to thicker lotions. It plays well with my silicone-based primer and tinted serum too! * I waited to review this after i used it for a while. Im not sure why people are saying it burns their eyes, i have not had that experience at all, and i sweat a lot! 

Highly recommend to all who are looking for something moisturizing and lightweight. Doesnt feel thick or greasy!!! Will definitely be repurchasing * I really like this sunscreen because it is light and moisturizing, doesn't pill, feels comfortable on my skin, and I know it protects me from UV damage. However, I cannot put it anywhere above my lower eyeline. It always runs into my eyes even if I appy it above my eyebrows, so I must use a different non-running sunscreen around eyes and on forehead and temples. It leaves a shiney finish on my oily skin which I like. It would be perfect if it did not get in my eyes. I also must shake it vigorously each time because it separates after not being used for a month. I wish it did not run into my eyes. Maybe powdering would stop it if you like to use face powder. * I haave tried so many facial
Sunscreens shd this is my go to!
Great under makeup and my dry skin feels soft all day. * I wish I had read more comments before buying because they are all correct…this stuff will burn your eyes even when you do not put it anywhere near your eyes. AND hours upon hours after applying. Honestly, I am flabbergasted at why this is but it is. Do not buy. * I love this sunscreen if im careful about not applying too close to my eyes. It sits nicely on the face and doesnt look too oily. I use a light layer of pressed powder in my t zone on top of this to combat the oil and it works pretty well. Just be super careful around the eyes, ive never had such intense burning pain in my eyes as i did when some of this accidentally got on my eyelids * it says serum sunscreen which makes you think it would be thin but its lotion textured it feels great on the skin like velvet, but the eye burn is to bad even when I don't apply near my eyes it still burns so many others that don't burn for less money 5/10"
107,hero cosmetics,force shield superlight sunscreen broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2030344,2591983," * It goes on incredibly light. It smooths out my natural redness. No white cast, and no strong perfumes. I absolutely love it and will buy it again! * This is hands-down the best face sunscreen I've ever bought. I wear it every morning over my moisturizer when I go workout outdoors. 

It feels light on my skin, doesn't leave a white cast, and doesn't sting my eyes at all. I also have combo/oily skin and it doesn't leave me with an oily look like some other sunscreens do. 

I've bought way more expensive sunscreens in the past that didn't work half as well as this one does. 10/10 recommend. * Most sunscreens burn my eyes, but this was another level. It also doesn't stop burning for a long time. If you don't mind that or don't touch your eye area often, it's an okay sunscreen. * This might be the best advice i ever type out into the online universe. If you are struggling with cystic/ hormonal acne & acne scars, this is FOR YOU!!!! i stopped using this sunscreen for a couple months (shame on me) because i thought my skin didn't really need it i was using lots of other products at the time too. The minute i stopped using this specific sunscreen, my acne and texture got so inflamed and bumpy and scaly i was obviously upset. Also want to add you do NOT need a 7 step skin care routine esp if you have the same acne issues as me. Best thing i ever did for my acne was get a good facial cleanser (do not wash your face everyday unless your actually dirty from outside things/events ect.) and get a good moisturizer/sunscreen. That is IT. I know this may not be suitable for everyones skin tone since its green but i am very fair and it doesn't break me out or leave a white cast & doesn't peel and calms the redness down instantly in my face. plus i wear heavy makeup all the time and this if anything helps my makeup look better i use it as a primer/moisturizer bc its that good. Also ALWAYS WEAR sunscreen no matter what!! your skin needs it even if you aren't going outside!! good luck stranger :) * I was very impressed by how lightweight this product is for mineral sunscreen with a high concentration of zinc. Did not make me break out. * It smells a little bit like oatmeal lol but i love this product!! It doesn't break me out and works well in the 100 degree Texas humidity. * Unlike other sunscreens, this one is not oily. It doesn't leave a sheen or clog your pores. No sticky film, just your skin. It also doesn't have that ""sunscreen"" smell. Perfect!"
108,bubble,plus one tinted daily mineral sunscreen broad spectrum spf 40,pimprod2041039,2616745," * I purchased this one and the regular spf in the yellow bottle and I like this one better. It feels good on my skin, easy to blend. Has a pretty glow but not greasy. Hasnt caused breakouts. Its not a full coverage product by any means and you will need to reapply specially if you want to keep the SPF benefits (as you should anyway because of the spf). No smell. Easy to blend. All my other makeup blends very well on top and looks good not streaky. * Great spf i love it to pieces would totally recommend bubble skincare to anyone and everyone * This is not reslly suitable for anyone that has oily/combo or even medium or light skin tones. It leaves an orange-brown film. However, if you have dry leaning dark skin, this might work for you * I have never in my ten years of purchasing every sunscreen known to man liked a mineral sunscreen. I have maturing combination skin and I am a makeup junkie so I need a sunscreen that works for my skin type and wears well under makeup. I have a korean sunscreen favorite that does that, but I wanted a mire easily accessible option. THIS IS IT. I don't know what magic is in this, but my skin looks smooth, my makeup applies flawlessly, and has never looked better. I am amazed. This is the only product I've changed in my routine and so far it has worked with every kind of foundation I have. * I think this is a really good sunscreen and gives a nice tint to your face, but it does look a little greasy * Amazing prodcut that is glowy and amazingly priced! Its not very dark and i love that! Yoi also dont feel it on your face at all! * I have very sesitive, acne prone skin and this sunscreen has checked every box for me! I was nervous to add a new product to my routine, but im SO happy i did. I almost never write reviews, but this sunscreen deserves five stars. The tint can be blended into even the fairest of skin (hi, redhead here). I thought it would be too dark, but i just make sure to blend it doen my neck and at my hairline. It gives a nice bronzey glow but doesnt look orange/too dark. No new breakouts which is the biggest win!"
109,kopari beauty,sun shield on-the-glow sheer stick sunscreen spf 40,pimprod2043794,2618936," * I liked this because the application was smooth and clear and moisturizing. Although I couldn't stand the strong scent and the glitters were too big for my liking. I can't rate the sun protection though * This has a great lightweight and silky feel when applied and to top it off the glittery finish looks beautiful!! * This is the best sunscreen stick I've ever used. You can use it anywhere, and even on the face it doesnt break me out. It smells nice and is so easy to toss in a bag and reapply as needed. The glitter is something I dont mind, but my bf is not a fan! If they came out with a shimmer/clear version, it would appeal to a lot of people! Overall it lasts for a long while and I will repurchase. * This is a pretty product, but the large glitter chunks are just not for me at all. If you want people to be able to see visible glitter flakes on your body, you might like this. Maybe good for a festival or something.

I prefer a more pearly glow like the liquid version of this product. I would never use this on the face. It does glide on really nicely though. * Great spf for travel or beach/pool days. Leaves skin dewy and sparkly and absorbs pretty well and has a nice scent… So, listen to the reviews! It does has large chunks of glitter flakes. It will be noticeable on the skin. However, I've been using this for the past few days on my face and I like it. Be careful applying to close to the eye area because it can burn… Has a nice light tropical scent. * This stuff is so pretty on the skin and effective! This is part of my daily routine. I put it on mu chest / arms and its very comfortable and long lasting. I wore it out in the pool for 2+ hours (im very very fair skinned) and i did not burn. This product gives me the perfect glow. Due to the heavy oils and glitter, i would not put this on my face, but it's beautiful elsewhere. * not greasy, not too glowy, feels lightweight, overall great product! but that glitter is pretty big AND it sticks a lot - even after a shower it was still there, so just be aware if that bothers you!"
110,coola,classic body organic sunscreen lotion spf 50 fragrance free,pimprod2030631,2591975," * This is a good sunscreen. My one complaint is that the cap does not seal the product properly. There is no click mechanism to make sure the cap is sealed. The SPF lotion is not travel friendly as said cap is loose and will not stay on the product if it's in your bag, especially if you are going to multiple places throughout the day. * Possibly my favorite body sunscreen ever. It blends in so well without feeling sticky or gross. Blends in completely clear. And NO SMELL. this is my new go to daily body sunscreen, im so happy i found it. * I had high hopes. But it left a weird film on my skin and rub off in clumps. Even after re-applying several times I still got severely sunburnt. * I was hesitant to try this because of some of the negative reviews, especially the reviews that mention a bad smell; however, I'm happy to report that mine has ZERO smell. It has a fairly lightweight consistency and blends onto the skin seamlessly. There is a slight tacky feel, and I noticed that when I rested my elbows on surfaces in my car, a grease spot was left behind - this is the reason I took off 1 star. Yet overall, this is a nice product that I'd definitely recommend. I also appreciate the fact that it's free of coconut oil! * This is my go-to for my tattoos and I've been using it for about 3 or 4 years now. There is no white cast, and it makes my tattoos (all black and gray) pop! I can truly attest to the sun protection, as once I missed a spot and could see a very clear, visible pink patch with a hard line differentiating from where the protection was! I also use this on my daughter who has sensitive skin and eczema, and it seems to be going okay. 

Fragrance-free means no added frangrance—so it smells like a natural sunscreen, which I don't mind. But I see some people complaining about that…

If you're looking for excellent sun protection, especially for tattoos, I HIGHLY recommend this product! * Dries quickly and invisible on skin. Leaves a somewhat velvety texture, but feels very light and not sticky. Good amount of product for the price. I had high hopes due to positive reviews about no cast and fragrance-free (I'm very sensitive to scents). I have to wear/reapply sunscreen a lot for medical reasons, so I'm very picky and this one checks almost every box. 

However, it has a horrible chemical-y smell, sort of like plastic? I actually thought it was just from the container and would disappear after drying, but even hours later, I could still smell it on my skin. It's not super strong, but I wear sunscreen on legs, arms and face and reapply frequently, so it's noticeable.

I'll try to use it up because it's so pricey, but definitely will not be repurchasing. Really disappointing because it's wonderful otherwise! Probably good for a beach day, sports, etc. Just not for everyday. * I wanted an everyday spf for my body during the upcoming spring/summer months and I loved the idea of this sunscreen. I especially loved the ingredients and fragrance free aspect. Unfortunately, as other customers reviewed - it does indeed have a scent. I was not too crazy about the scent so I returned it. It's not a fruity or sweet smell, more of a chemical scent which was light but I could smell on my arm especially if my arm was near my face. 
PRO: it does rub in very nicely, no white cast (I'm tanned), not greasy."
111,coola,classic face sunscreen mist spf 50,pimprod2030632,2591973," * I purchased this thinking it would be easy over makeup. The first and last time I used this product my face and neck were so red, inflamed and swollen i could not open my eyes. My daughter reported this product to the state due to seeing my face the morning after using this. Truly, beware! * If this came in the same cannister as the sunscreen spray, maybe it would work better? I spritzed it into the sink the first time to prime the pump, but there was still leakage and over-spray that dripped onto my clothes while applying it to my face. It didn't dry clear and left very noticeable marks on my shirt. * Really like this.  No greasy feeling. * I suffered all day with irritated burning eyes after using this product. * This suncreen spray is very oily. The directions state that you can apply over makeup but I would not recommend that, it will have you looking like a glazed donut & your makeup just might slide off. The coola makeup setting spray is a better option if you are looking for something that does not make your face oily. It does feels a little drying but its better then the mist. * I did not expect it to have such a strong alcohol like scent to it. It makes sense as it is quick drying, but the smell was off-putting to me. * So this product did prevent me from getting sunburned while I had on a full face of makeup. HOWEVER this spray left me a shiny, greasy mess which accentuated all of my texture. It did not disrupt my makeup, but it did make my makeup look worse."
112,murad,multi-vitamin clear coat spf 50,pimprod2044297,2622108," * The 'clear coat' went on smoothly but required a fair amount of rubbing to get it absorbed into my face. 
I cannot really speak to the sun protection offered by this product as I spend my days inside at a desk. The few times I went out into the sun after using it, my face had a bit of a burning sensation for a few minutes but I did not get sunburnt/tanned. * I was recommended this since the formula seemed relatively clean and it left no white cast. BUT its SO GREASY. 

I have dry skin and this sits in my face for so long so I have to wait quite a bit to add make up. On busy mornings, I basically have to use a different sunscreen so my makeup can sit well in my skin. * Best sunscreen ever especially since I always wear a full face of makeup almost everyday. I love the clear formula and how easy it is to apply with absolutely no white cast. It really nice as a primer also. Gifted by Murad * This is a clear sunscreen and very easy to apply. It has a scent but its not overbearring. The only thing is it leaves my skin so oily and slippery. I have combonation skin and this takes about an hour to set and feel ""dry"". * I have dry skin and this literally makes my face feel like an oil slick! Its clear so no cast but if using the correct amount it literally just slides all over my skin and takes almost 2 hours for it to not feel so slick. I will finish it to see if the vitamins make a difference but the texture is awful * It is by far the best defensive move I've made to protect my skin. My skin feels BETTER at the end of the day and I work in a very dusty dehydrating place. I have sensitive mature dry skin and this acts like a shield ALL day!!! I'm so glad I took a chance on this one! * This is hands down the best sunscreen I've ever used. It is suitable for all skin types and works great under makeup as a primer. Love this stuff!"

It's the size of a mini. I wish the amount of product was states in the description. Its 15g. Im a small woman and the entire product fits in my palm. But its easy to apply and my kids love the texture. Makes it really easy to reapply af school. * This face stick is so much easier to apply on the kids than a lotion or spray. It smells really good and a little goes along way. Very easy to carry with you to reapply when needed. * This face stick is so much easier to apply on the kids than a lotion or spray. It smells really good and a little goes along way.

She has sensitive skin when it comes to fragrances and had no reaction to this thankfully. Application is so easy she can do it herself."
114,supergoop!,every. single. face. watery lotion spf 50,pimprod2032491,2595519," * I want to preface by saying I have really dry/dehydrated skin. I got a sample of this sunscreen and absolutely love it! It is easy to spread all around my face and i dont have any problems with it pilling my skin care or makeup over top. I can see why people say this is greasy but for me, this just works and makes me look natural glowy not greasy. Thia is helpful for me when it comes to skin prep before makeup. I wear light coverage skin tints applied with a buffing brush over it with no issue, along with other cream products. I will be buying a full size of this one. * This sunscreen has a strong smell of alcohol when applying on my skin. Didn't like the texture and was not as watery as described. Would not recommend. * I love this! It is quite dewy, and takes a few hours to set in. That's something I love because I typically don't wear foundation, or a lot of make up at all. It's great though! I highly recommend! * I was looking forward to using this, but upon first application had to wash it off my face immediately due to overwhelming fragrance.  I am not usually bothered by fragrance at all, but this has an extremely strong fragrance, almost like putting fabric softener directly on your face.  It made me so sick I had to wash off immediately. * I like supergoop - their unseen sunscreen is amazing.  However this sunscreen is incredibly greasy.  You really have to work it in and in doing so, it will pill the skincare you habe underneath.  It will also pill the makeup (liquid, like foundation) on top. * SPF 50 PA ++++ I use it for the last 2 years.Love it. * I'm on my second bottle of this and I'm a huge fan!! I have oily prone skin and so my sunscreen must-haves are ""not be greasy"" and ""not give me breakouts"" and this does both of those! It's a quite thin texture, there isn't a residue, and it feels like nothing on the skin after it soaks in. I can sleep in it (while camping or when I forget to wash it off) and that doesn't give me breakouts. The finish I would describe as ""slight natural glow"" that becomes more of a natural finish the longer it's on the face.

This is the product that truly has gotten me to be diligent about daily sunscreen because it's just so darn comfortable to wear. Once it sinks in, I can forget I'm even wearing it. I can't rave about this product enough!"
115,supergoop!,mini glow oil spf 50 dry body oil sunscreen,pimprod2042889,2617633," * I passed this on underneath my cream foundation (I have dry skin), and my foundation looks flawless, and I have not gotten any extra freckles. It is a beautiful sunscreen I will keep buying it. * I used this while in Trinidad, and I was sunburned so badly. Everyhwere I used this oil is where I burned the most. * So my skin is a bit more on the dehydrated side and has left my skin looking super glowing and healthy. I apply my moisturizer, SPF then pat this on my skin it is not feel greasy and it looks amazing a little goes a long way. * I can't believe how much my skin loved this product. When I bought it I was not sure about the how it would feel on my skin. Well my skin took to it l Iike a duck to water. My skin looks and feels better than ever, even after all the sun damage I did to it over the years (I am a 60's baby who was a teenager in the 70's when we did not know what SPF was and chose sunscreen by smell, I did not do the Crisco or baby oil and iodine crazingness). It is amazing how moisturized my skin looks when I put it on, which is daily. The skin on my legs and arms look like they did 30 years ago plus I have the bonus of SPF50! The dry old lady skin on my legs and arms is gone! I would recommend this product to everyone I know no matter what there age is! * Ordered this because I use body wash with AHA and havent been protecting my skin. Got the smaller size to try it out. So far, I like it but it has a noticeable scent. Almost like honey. It may say this in tje ingredients but I was thrown off because there other products are scentless or has a sunscreen smell.

It fades with time but wouldnt be weird if you were layering scents and the honey stayed around"

It did! I have sensitive skin, both oily and dry if that makes sense. This product goes on smoothly, blends in vs. typical sunscreens that never seem to soak into the skin.

My face started stinging and itching after the second use and it doesnt go on as smooth. * i loved this product for so long, but didnt realize that it what was breaking me out. i tried a different cleanser, added an exfoliater etc. NOTHING would get rid of the harsh bumps all over my face. not until i researched and found out it had safflower it in which (can) support fungal acne. i have dry, sensitive acneic skin so this may work for others but definitely not for me. very disappointed and wish i found out sooner. not even 3 days after stopping this product, my skin is clearing up. * I used to be a big fan of the Superscreen Daily Moisturizer, and although they kept the packaging the same, they changed the formula and the name to Superscreen Hydrating Daily Cream. I think brands should be more transparent about informing their customers that they're actually buying a different product than what they're used to. The consistency of the new cream is thicker and harder to spread, but what stands out the most to me is the smell: somewhere in between Play-Doh and generic baby sunscreen. My partner has sensitive skin around his eyes, and the old formula didn't cause him any burning, but the new one does. I wouldn't buy this again. * I bought this because it had avobenzone but no octocrylene (at the time). Great texture but I reacted badly to something in it. Guessing it was the algae because I've used the other ingredients before without issue."

As with any sunscreen product, you need to reapply for protection. * Bought the travel size one just to see how it is and I love it. It makes your skin glow very nice! * First off, I LOVE the way it smells!! Originally I was apprehensive about the price (especially since it was my first time trying it) BUT it spreads well with a small amount, it's a decent size, it has just the right amount of shimmer and it absorbs into the skin quickly so once it's applied, you'd immediately forget it's even there if it didn't make you sparkle. Honestly, no complaints about it personally. However, if you have oily skin that breaks out easily and you plan to use it, whether on your face or body, I would be conscious of that given that it's an oily substance rather than a lotion. * Love the way it smells, but It doesn't apply as easy as you'd think, it's a thicker consistency and i feel like you need to apply allot"

Unbelievable white cast and feels heavy and greasy. * I have a light to medium skin tone and it left a horrible white cast. It was heard to use because no matter how much I blended it, you could still see a white cast. * I was optimistic since I heard the brand was good but this specific product isnt. It left a white cast and did not blend no matter how long i took blending it on my face. Had pretty embarrsing moments with this too. * This sunscreen leaves a terrible white cast no matter how much you rub it in your skin. * This product leaves a very white cast.  To be expected, I guess, with a mineral base. * I am a brown girl who was excited to try this sunscreen out, but i forgot my white friend recommended this one, so LO AND BEHOLD, when i put this product on my face i absolutely looked like an extra from White Chicks. DO NAWTTTT BUY THIS GUYSS! * I never leave reviews and I never make returns, but I had to make an exception for this product. The white cast really is bad, even coming from someone quite pale.

Then the sunscreen got into my eyes and no amount of rinsing helped the burning. My eyes were red and puffy all day. It took hours to feel normal again. It was the only step in my routine that I changed that day. * Shisedo changed this formula a couple of years ago and this is one time where the new product is as good or better than the previous. It truly is skin care but also acts as a makeup primer. It's great under makeup or on its own. It's not greasy at all and great for combo or oily skin. * Unfortunately it is not for me. I like the idea and feeling of the glow it has but the white cast is awful. I didn't notice the first few times because I wore it under makeup but put it on for an outdoor walk and when I looked in the mirror it looked like I stuck my face in baby powder. For reference I have a medium deep complexion. It may work for other skin tones but if you are darker then run. * Love the feeling of this, its like your wearing nothing but it does leave a whote cast on my skin. I have medium skin tone * I tried this for a while and its okay. I dont like that it gives me a gray cast and i dont like the texture on my skin. I have oily skin so i end with more oily of shiny parts on my face. * I really liked the forumla but it left a grey-ish cast on me (for reference I'm shade 330 in Fenty foundation). I spent a lot of time rubbing it in but a friend of mine commented on how grey I looked while outside on our walk :( returned for this reason! * I really like this sunscreen.  It's very lightweight on the skin and shows no color at all.  I wear it under my makeup and put it on the top of my hands."

I had welts all over my face,arms, and chest. * Not greasy!! Smells great, gives skin a nice glow! Love that it's vegan! Friends love it as well! * I was hopeful for this body sunscreen because I really like Supergoop; however, I found the body mist to be VERY greasy. If protected well against the sun when I was in Grenada, but it was so greasy on my skin. * This was super easy to apply. It did leave my skin a little greasy but nothing too bad.

I got this almost a week ago and noticed people complaining about it being crumbly or drying out and i think i know why. When you first open the product there should be a tiny cap on top of the jelly stick! DONT THROW THIS AWAY!!  This is whats going to help keep your product from drying out. Which is why i think a oot of people have been having issues with it. It is a bit of a hassle to keep putting that tiny cap on it but its worth it to keep my product from drying out and getting crumbly.  Hope this helps! Also the formula is perfect for my combination acne prone skin. Its been leaving me hydrated and goes well under my makeup. Wish they had a bigger size but overall it works wonderfully. * I really wanted to like and support this product but it was just so crumbly, it broke apart when i was using. I tried to shave down  and even it out when it first started chipping off but unfortunately it did not work, i feel like i waisted so much product * Purchased this around July and planned to use this daily. Worked like normal the first couple of uses. Then started to crumble into pieces as I kept using.  The stick only lasted me about a month. This product is definitely not worth the hype. * Not worth the hype. The sunscreen is not smooth enough to glide directly on yo your face as shown by LiveTinted ads.

This goes on super thick and after a few minutes began to rub off in huge pills everywhere. Kinda gross - I wont repurchase. * I couldn't be happier! It's been a long time coming. Where to even start? The price is beautiful. The SPF 30 works. The scent is wonderful, I love vanilla and coconut. The lotion soaked in perfectly on my sensitive combo skin. I use this moisturizer when I'm going to wear makeup. And I use a lot of it! This is now going to be my go-to moisturizer. * Love this sunscreen. It's affordable and not irritating. My skin is super sensitive when it comes to sunscreen and this one is the most affordable in the market that my skin actually likes. I love the scent as well but I also hope they come out with a non-frangrance version of this formula! Formula absorbs well and is non-greasy. * Loved this for my Hawai'i trip.

Ill continue to use and reccomend if anyone i know is looking for a solid face stick * I took a chance on this because I couldn't find Coola's stick sunscreen. Reviews all looked good. Wow. Just WOW. It goes on thick and white. Seriously, if you're going to a costume party and don't have white face paint, this is the perfect dupe. My daughter has incredibly fair skin and this was so white it wouldn't even blend in to look less ridiculous. Remember how lifeguards would put zinc oxide on their noses? This is that level of coverage and appearance. 

On a positive note, I then purchase Sun Bum 50spf for kids. It's clear, smells amazing and works great too. * Brought this hoping it would work as well as the supergoop stick but does not.

I do not like the bottle it comes in. Theres so much wasted lotion at the bottom thats hard to get to unless I cut upen the bottle— and its a think bottle, which is difficult and dangerous to cut…

I know that it is highly recommended but I don't like it and it makes my skin kind of greasy... * I picked this up at the recommendation of my dermatologist and I really, really wanted to love this, but it unfortunately stings my eyes like crazy. I can't put this anywhere near my eyes or they burn and water like crazy. It's unfortunate because this checks all my other boxes.

Over time I noticed my face felt a little stingy after my morning routine, and I just thought perhaps I had over exfoliated at some point. Then one day my face and eyes kept burning, and I thought it was my makeup. I washed my face and did my morning routine again including spf and had to wash it off AGAIN and realized it was just getting worse so I decided no makeup, but the burning?? And finally I just couldn't stand ANYTHING on my face, and I had to call out and go to the urgent care. I had patch tested it and worn it just fine for a few weeks, but somehow just developed an intense reaction to it. And removing that one item from my routine set everything right. I was disappointed and out money for the urgent care and missing work, and had a goofy red and painful face. I don't think anyone can patch test for weeks reasonably, but please learn from me- if your face starts tingling after your morning routine and this is the only thing that's new, don't wait for it to get worse. Just toss it. * I've tried many drugstore sunscreens and this is one I definitely recommend! 
It does go on a bit oily but letting it go into your skin for a few minutes it leaves a clear no whitecast application. I can put my foundation on without thinking about how it can mess up my shade! If you wear maybelline fit me foundation, this sunscreen does not separate your makeup underneath. Highly recommend!! * I really didn't care for this - the smell for me was very strong and off-putting, the texture was very oily and I didn't like how intense the orange-yellow coloring was.  It does protect from the sun, so it does the job, but I would not buy again. * I am not sure if I maybe got a bad batch but I bought this and every time I use it on my face, it inevitably begins running down my face and gets in my eyes. Recently went tubing on the river with friends and had to keep my eyes COMPLETELY SHUT for two hours because I couldn't try and wash it out with river water and we had run out of bottled water. I use it on my body now but the consistency of the product isn't great; it's super oily. I normally love Neutrogena skin products but this was a no from me :( * Burns burns burns * I was looking for a new sunscreen and happened to pick this up. It has a very creamy consistency. I don't know if I got a bad batch because the first time I applied some liquid came out with it. Even with shaking before applying, the sunscreen was still very shiny. It felt VERY wet on my face but this feeling did go away after a few minutes of wearing it. I have noticed that I've broken out a little more and that some of the acne has lasted longer than they normally do after I added this to my routine. Also, the sunscreen has a very orange tone to it. I'm cool toned and I don't know if I'm just seeing things but I noticed a slight difference in skin tone between the second and third picture after rubbing it in. I didn't notice sensitivity to my eyes when I was using this, so that's good! I'll probably be finishing this up as a body sunscreen. I'd say that if you have drier skin, aren't acne-prone, and have a warmer undertone this would probably work better for you than me!"
134,coola,travel size piÃ±a colada classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 30,pimprod2012271,2561104," * I am loving COOLA right now. This SPF is perfect for this dreadful Texas humidity and heat. It's very lightweight, non-greasy, and has a pleasant scent. Reapplying is a breeze since the product doesn't build up on the skin or cause a film. It's very breathable and works well with general skin sensitivities. The size is quite large for travel, but still small enough to throw in your beach bag and still have space for other necessities. It has a click-locking spray top so it doesn't accidentally spray in your bag. I will say that if your skin is very dry, you may want to go for a cream SPF because this does not provide much moisture. This is definitely made for hot, sunny summers. I love it and I know for sure I am buying a full-sized bottle to keep on hand.

***This review was collected as part of a promotion.*** * As a professional in the beauty industry, I've learned firsthand the  importance of sun protection, making COOLA's  spray an indispensable asset. In an industry where skincare is very important, COOLA stands out with its dedication to not only protecting against harmful UV rays but also enhancing the overall experience of sun care.

COOLA's sunscreen spray doesn't just shield your skin from UVA and UVB rays; Its broad-spectrum protection ensures comprehensive coverage, safeguarding against both premature aging and potential skin damage. As someone deeply invested in skin health, I love COOLA's commitment to providing a product that protects and cares for my skin.

The scent of Piña Colada fragrance is delicious. Gone are the days of sunscreen smelling like, well, sunscreen. Instead, COOLA's tropical scent transports me to my last vacation. It's a big change from the clinical smell of traditional sunscreens, making the application process a sensory experience.

I did not have any issue in my delicate skin but I always recommend  a patch test.

In my personal opinion, COOLA's in spray isn't just a sun protection product; it's an  evolution of skincare. With its comprehensive protection, anti-aging benefits, and irresistible Piña Colada scent, COOLA has redefined what it means to stay safe in the sun. So, whether I am lounging by the pool or hitting the beach, I make COOLA my go-to companion for summer adventures. And a big pus smells delicious! * The COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a delightful sun protection experience. Its tropical scent evokes visions of sunny beaches and relaxation, enhancing the application process with a touch of indulgence. The organic formula boasts SPF 30, providing reliable protection against both UVA and UVB rays, crucial for preventing sunburn and long-term skin damage. What sets this sunscreen apart is its lightweight texture, which absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. This feature is particularly appealing for those who dislike the heavy feeling often associated with sunscreen application. The spray mechanism ensures effortless and even coverage, making it convenient for reapplication throughout the day, especially during outdoor activities. Furthermore, the use of organic ingredients adds to its appeal for those who prioritize natural  products. 

 In conclusion, the COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a luxurious and effective sun protection solution for those who appreciate both quality and indulgence in their routine. * As a licensed Esthetician, we our taught early on how important using SPF to protect our skin. This aerosol is easy to use and smells amazing! If you have sensitive skin I would recommend spraying into your hands first then applying. I did have a slightly burning feel when I sprayed directly. But, overall I really love how cute and small and effective this spf is to use. My skin adapted the more I used this spf. * I love this sunscreen! Its perfect for travel and smells great. I used it almost all up on my recent vacation. It smells likea tropical holiday on a beach with a coconut. I would definetly recommend. I know the spf is quality and better packaged and easily portable. * This review was collected as part of a promotion. My name is Michele and I'm a Beauty Expert in my early 30's with fair combination skin. As the weather gets warmer, I have to make sunscreen a priority in my skincare routine. I am absolutely loving the Coola Clear Spray Body Sunscreen SPF 30 Piña Colada Sunscreen. I love its yummy, natural Piña Colada scent. It takes me away on a vacation to my favorite beach. This is a non-aerosol sunscreen that is so easy to spray onto your skin. It has a lightweight, lighter than air, mist texture that absorbs so quickly into my skin without leaving any greasy residue. I got the chance to try the full size 6 fluid ounce version of this spray sunscreen. This sunscreen is formulated with at least 70% Organic Ingredients. You get broad spectrum SPF 30 UVA and UVB protection. This sunscreen has water resistance that lasts up to 80 minutes so you can enjoy more time in the sun and water without worrying about reapplying every hour. With this amazing sunscreen you not only protect your skin but keep it hydrated too. Plant Protection is formulated with antioxidant rich nutrients which help fight free radicals, hydrates and nourishes your skin barrier too. Safflower Oleosomes is plant derived encapsulation technology that makes this formulation even more effective. Spray this sunscreen on your skin 15 minutes before any sun exposure. Make sure to reapply this sunscreen every 80 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone of any age who loves the sun and wants to have lightweight, long lasting and fast absorbing sun protection that also keeps your skin hydrated too. * Sun care is very important because it can help prevent skin cancer. I can't stress enough how important it is to wear sunscreen everyday. I was looking for a new everyday sunscreen and I think I found it. I prefer spray sunscreen than a cream so this one is perfect. It smells absolutely amazing and I love it! With most sunscreens they can get really heavy and greasy. I was really pleased that it absorbs really well on the skin and doesn't leave a layer of oil behind. Another thing I like is the ingredients, because I was having a hard time finding sunscreens that didn't have harsh or harmful ingredients. The Coola brand has organic and vegan ingredients so no worries about having harmful chemicals being absorbed in your body. So far so good and I would repurchase it."
135,black girl sunscreen,kids moisturizing broad spectrum spf 50,pimprod2038237,2609781," * I apply this sunscreen daily. I have been using this for a couple of years now. I've strayed a couple of times, but I always come back to this. I have sensitive skin and eyes, and this is the only one I have found that doesn't irritate my skin, or sting my eyes. (I slather this all over my face, including my eyelids) * I love my BGS Kid's because it feels amazing and moisturizing on my face! I was recommended this by a friend, and it leaves no white cast. I don't like gel-consistency sunscreens, so I was stoked to find a classic lotion consistency, this one works great for me! * most moisturizing sunscreen i've ever tried and it feels good on my skin. I'm a darkskinned and it leaves a nice glow
HUGE CON: makes my eyes burn and makes my eyes water throughout the day everytime i've worn it, you HAVE to make sure to not put it around your eyes. started using it on my body instead of my face. * Been using this for years and I absolutely love it. Goes on a bit oily but dries down after a few minutes. Leaves my skin moisturized and protected without a purple cast. Highly recommend and have put a my friends and family on to it too. * it does give you the glowy/shiny look. but looks and feels great on the skin. stays on and no burning or breakouts which i struggle with both.
I recommend the kids version for adults and kids * too harsh, breaks out my skin every time i use it * This was good product I tried the black girl sunscreen for adults and personally I like that one better, this one is ok I just have really dry skin and the other one is more oily, if you have very oily skin buy this one the adult one is better if u have extremely dry skin"
136,shiseido,urban environment vita-clear sunscreen spf 42,pimprod2039504,2612331," * Excellent choice for those with sensitive skin. Infused with vitamin C, it offers effective sun protection without causing breakouts. The lotion leaves a slightly shiny finish but doesn't make the skin oily, making it a great base for foundation. Highly recommended for its lightweight feel and skin-friendly formulation. * Goes in clear which is great fir those ""no makenup days"" 
Very hydrating and gives my skin a nice glow. I wear in the summer time and my face always feels protected. 
Id tou are jot into the glowy/dewey look, id recommend a diffrent product! * I really like this sunscreen! It absorbs very quickly, lightweight, and help controls my oil production throughout the day. I still have to blot my face in the afternoon, but it helps. I also like to use a water base moisturizer underneath :) 
PLEASE NOTE* a little goes A LONG WAY! 
Your face will be a grease pit if you put too much on, learned the hard way. * I dont get why some people love the ""dewey"" effect because at least on me, when I put this sunscreen on, it felt like I just spent the day frying stuff in the kitchen and all sweaty, right after my shower! It went straight to the trash can. * This sunscreen reminded me of a drugstore formula, not something I'd expect from Shiseido. It has an oily, sticky texture - not like your typical Shiseido sunscreen or a clear sunscreen like Supergoop. It's greasy, doesn't absorb well, and it stings the eyes terribly like a poorly-formulated budget buy. I really dislike it and will be returning it."
137,tula,mineral magic oil- free mineral sunscreen fluid broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2025972,2584410," * I use under any makeup or alone. Doesnt make my face break out and provides SPF * I love this!  it's a mineral sunscreen for face that truly goes on clear.  It has a beige tint til applied.  It adds a natural glow and makes skin look beautiful.   Perfect for mature skin.The expiration date (on the box and tube) isn't always great - 5 months.  The tube leaks into the cap, so I store mine with the tip upward. 
it's spf30, so it's efficacy is 2 hours - so reapply.   I highly recommend this for a mineral sunscreen. * It's lightweight and easy to wear but I dont feel like it protects me enough from the sun. I feel like I need to apply so much for it to work. Plus it's very small for the price. * The first bottle i bought was perfect. The sunscreen is incredible and makes you look so glowy. Doesnt break me out. I didnt have an issue with the bottle leaking. I just bought a second bottle and it is just not travel friendly at all. Half of it spilled in my toiletry bag. Id love for the packaging to get fixed so its not leaky but the product itself is top notch. Only sunscreen id ever use on my face * I do like this. It has a slight tint that when applied it's hardly noticeable but sunscreen seems a little drying but not as much as some other tinted sunscreens that I""ve tried. Would buy this again. * I find this sunscreen perfect for sitting under makeup or wearing it alone. * This sunscreen has Butyloctyl Salicylate, a cousin to octisalate, and a chemical UV absorber. That's how they can get a higher SPF with such a low concentration of Zinc or TO. So it isn't purely mineral. I like it and use it, but I wish they wouldn't market it as 100% mineral when it has unregulated chemical UV absorbers in it."
138,blue lizard australian sunscreen,sheer mineral sunscreen lotion for face spf 50+,pimprod2043669,2621977," * Although it's a sheer mineral sunscreen, I found that it's still difficult to completely rub into the skin and leaves a white cast (like most mineral sunscreens). I really wanted to like this brand as I've also tried their other sunscreens but they're just not for me. * I agree with many other reviewers about the product's comfort on the skin, easy to rub in formula, and ease of washing off compared to other mineral sunscreens. I switched to this from the CeraVe facial moisturizing lotion with SPF for a higher coverage and mineral. After about a month, my entire face was broken out, from my forehead line, temples, cheeks, chin, and jaw, all red under the skin bumps that were super itchy. Even though it's an otherwise clean product, make sure to spot test this a few times before buying! * I really wanted to like this sunscreen, especially because of the protection from blue light. However, this product isn't for me. It takes quite a while to rub in, and a white cast is still inevitable. It also feels greasy after a few hours of wear. I wish Ulta would restock the Jack Black sunscreen I have come to love over the years! * I tried the blue lizzard Sheer Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Face SPF 50+ and I was very impressed. It is very lightweight and goes on sheer. I have very dry skin and most mineral sunscreens leave my skin uncomfortably dry after 2 hours. This is not the case with the blue lizzard sunscreen. I am able to wear it and reaply without my skin feeling uncomfortable. This is a great product for the price. * When applying the proper amount, it does leave a white cast on brown skin. But feels great on skin * I was recommended by a dermalogist to use blue lizard. I have dark brown spots.I have been using this product for over 6 years. I have noticed a difference on my face. * I've heard nothing but good things about this brand and when I ran out of my current face sunscreen, I decided to try this one. I love that it's an SPF50. That's honestly the only positive thing I can say about this sunscreen. It comes out pretty runny, but it's the consistency of Elmer's Glue and I imagine that this is exactly what it would feel like if you tried to rub glue into your face. On top of being difficult to apply, it leaves a horrible white cast. This one was a miss for me."
139,sun bum,daily 50 face gel,pimprod2043277,2619923," * I hate dewy sunscreen. Ive tried all big popular brands (supergoop, shisedo, elta md, etc) and this is my got to. I reach for this spf over all the others beacuse it feels light on my skin and has a matte finish. I have acne prone skin and feel/ look gross with that dewy shiny finish. This sun bum fel is simliler to the super goop unseen but feels breathable on my skin. I give it a good shake and have no problem getting the recommended amount on. I see a few reviews say it smells bad- but i dont think it has any scent. I wear this everyday. * I really like this formula. Reminds me of Supergoop but less silicone-y and my skin felt like it breathed more. My issue was the scent. I am normally not sensitive to smells but this smelled like something spoiled and it didnt go away quickly. Like burning rubber and cat puke. Surprised more reviews havent commented on it. * this sunscreen basically acts like a silcone primer that smoothes and fills in prores while having a gripping affect. your skin just feels so immaculate thats the only word to describe it. i would moisturize your skin thoroughly and wait 5 minutes to let it absorb then wait at least 5 minutes before putting on any kind of makeup, you wont be disappointed. * This daily SPF gel is lightweight, glides on easily and doesn't give your face the typical white sunscreen cast.  It comes out of the bottle a little watery and then feels like silk as your rubbing it into your skin.  I love that this has a high SPF than most facial sunscreens. * If you've ever tried the Supergoop invisible sunscreen, this is practically the same thing for HALF the cost! Though highly raved about, I personally never enjoyed the Supergoop formula because the heavy silicone texture was off-putting and did nothing for my dry skin. It just felt like I was wearing a slippery silicone mask all day. I prefer dewy SPF lotions for this reason. They provide hydration and protection all in one. However, I love Sun Bum sunscreens so I still wanted to give this a try! The term ""gel"" is slightly misleading because it makes you think of a cooling gel consistency which this is not. This is definitely that same silicone texture, but the formula has a more hydrating quality to it. The silicone base gives it a mattifying texture which makes it invisible on the skin. The more exciting part: this is weightless and DOES NOT BURN THE EYES! I have yet to find a single U.S. chemical sunscreen that doesn't burn my eyes into oblivion. I don't know how this formula would hold up on the beach or under extreme sweating/activity, but I fully recommend (as it's advertised) for daily wear or under makeup. Sun Bum is killing it! * This is hands down the best-looking sunscreen I've ever tried.  Unlike other gel sunscreens, this one doesn't pill. * This contains coconut oil as one of the first ingredients.  If you are easily acne prone and/or prone to clogged pores stay away.  Coconut oil is HIGHLY comedogenic.  It would be nice if they created a facial sunscreen that is noncomedogenic."

141,beekman 1802,milk primer spf 35 3-in-1 daily defense sunscreen & makeup perfecter,pimprod2024957,2577634," * Let me start off by saying that it's not for everyone. 
Depending on whether you want: dewy, mattifying, silicone, etc. 
This is more matte, and depending on the foundation you use, you'll need primer too. But it's 100% worth a try! I'll be re-purchasing! * An Ulta employee so graciously put me on to this product when I came in looking for a primer with SPF coverage and wow, did they deliver! Goes on super smooth and has no issues with clinging to dry patches or pilling (though if you're having issues with pilling, check what products you're layering under this! Jojoba oil/rose hip seed oil have never given me issues). Helps to even out my makeup and leaves no noticeable white cast under medium coverage foundation. This is quite a dewy primer, which may not be suitable for super oily folks, but works great with my combo skin. Took me about 5 months of almost-daily use to fully use all of the product, so I feel like the price is more than fair given that is satisfies the purpose of both a primer and daily SPF. Just make sure to shake it well before use to combine the product and help the pump function better! * I love this stuff, the formula is thin and watery but it leaves the skin silky. It does not pill at all under makeup, and feels super loght weight. * did nothing for me * This profuct is AMAZING!! I absolutely love everything about it. The texture on my face, the scent, the blurring effect. Key is to let it dry at least 3-4 minutes before applying the next skin regimen step. * I'm south east Asian with neutral light to medium skin tone and this left a white cast. My makeup didn't settle well with the primer. don't want to throw it away so I use on the body for extra SPF. * I sooo wanted to love this product but the smell is so horrible. I think I got a bad batch because I haven't heard someone else complain of the smell. The texture and prime this product has is just so incredible though ;("
142,sun bum,mini original spf 45 sunscreen face mist,pimprod2044628,2625244," * I love this refresher spray. Plus, it has SPF. I mean, I don't count on that for the amount of SPF I need, but it's a bonus. If you don't like scent, this isn't for you, but I love it!  It doesn't stay strong, but every time I spray it, someone comments how great it smells. * I LOVE THE SPRAY. but not sure if its my fave daily sunscreen. I like a lotion sunscreen but this is convenient. Smells like all other sunbum products (banana/summer) and i layer diff spf products. * I use spf makeup but this is perfect to carry and apply when im oitside with out ruin my hair or makeup * Love this face SPF mist for a nice cooling effect. Recently went on a beach vacay.  I used this product throught the day. I could pull it out of my bag and quickly get my SPF protection with a clean clear light mist. It was cooling as well which was a great plus in the hot climate.  A light tropical scent that dissipates quickly. So glad i had this. Works great. I would definitely encourage others to purchase if just for the ease of use. I sprayed over makeup too. This is a great performance product. * Smells strongly of fake banana, burned the skin while applying, left me feeling sticky and greasy."

I have used old variant without any mint/acai and i loved that one. So trusting the brand, i bought the one with Mint this time.
One application of this Lip Balm (mint) and I end up having horrible allergic reaction.
My lips are burning, swollen, extremely dry, red, itchy. Wish I could add an image.
Hoping it clears soon, its been 3 days now. It pains while eating and even smiling.
Save yourself! * it doesnt taste bad at all, especially being an spf lipbalm. i love it, but the big box for an average sized product is kinda… meh. * It feels great on the lips. It's not sticky. It also smell good. What I hated was that it taste like sunscreen. I understand it's sunscreen balm but I just couldn't  love it. It taste like was eating sunscreen. * I was looking for a lip product with SPF for the summer months and running outside. I love the flavor and texture of this product, and it is very moisturizing. I do with it was slightly thicker so it would stay on a bit longer. * extremely moisturizing, the acai one tastes mostly like sunscreen but the point of the product is sun protection not yummy taste. overall really enjoy this product!"
144,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen stick spf 40 invisible sun protection,pimprod2043900,2620575," * I bought this product because of the rating thinking it would be a great product but it wasnt at first it felt great on the skin but whenever i tried washing it off it would burn my face sooo bad  then the second time I pit it on my face was soooooo dry and flaky. I totally don't recommend * I really wanted to love this, as i have several other products that i love. However, if your skin is on the dryer side I wouldn't recommend. I even used it on my young son while on vacation in FL and his poor face was also very dry. * Nice that you can put it on over your makeup and it doesn't feel heavy * It does what it says, you barely feel it on your skin and works very well. I have sensitive skin and this didn't irritate it at all. Favorite part was that it wasnt greasy at all. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars its pricey for the size. * So i love how this feels in my skin. I can feel it, but it doesn't look greasy. Does make my make up more prone to smudging when im setting it which is annoying. Smudges when i apply over make up which is annoying, but perhaps wouldn't be so noticeable on lighter make up days. * This js a great sunscreen stick. Does not break me out (a miracle), glides over the skin without tugging, leaves make mostly intact (mostly), and feels comfortable on the skin. However - the stick is a round shape, and fairly wide. This makes it extremely difficult-to-impossible to get the stick anyway with angles or crevices. I cant get the stick to apply near my eyes and between my brows at the base of the nose. Other than that, I have nothing bad to say about this product. Highly recommend! * I burn very easily but love the sun. Every other face sunscreen I have tried eventually makes my combo skin too oily…and I've tried dozens of different brands. 

This glides on easily, doesn't feel greasy and I don't burn at all. There is a light barrier left on the face after application, which I don't mind. Much better for me than lotion or serum type sunscreen that eventually turns to grease on my face. Bonus points for not being a liquid, which makes it perfect for flying. Worth the trip to a local Ulta given that it's been sold out online for a while."

146,blue lizard australian sunscreen,sheer body lotion spf 50+,pimprod2043668,2621972," * Just received today, and really enjoy it upon first impressions. Applied this sunscreen to my face and it was so easy to blend out and didn't feel drying as the day went on. It did look a bit shiny, so I fluffed a bit of translucent powder over my t-zone to take care of the matter. I can't speak for how it performs under makeup, but I have an inkling that it will look beautiful. After trying my fair share of sunscreen over the years, I think this one will be my new go-to. I only ever buy mineral sunscreens, and this one is pretty exceptional. * works very smoothly, didn't have any bad reaction to it and I have sensitive skin. highly recommend!! * The sunscreen itself blends well and feels ligjtweight. Only con is that it'll leave white stains all over your clothes and other belongings. You have to wait about 30 minutes after applying for it to fully absorb and not leave stains. If you have the time to wait then it's great! But not recommended for someone like me who rushes in the morning and doesn't like white stains. * ...than the Blue Lizard Sensitive product, same price, larger volume? I just took tubes of both on vacation. None of us could tell the difference between Sheer and Sensitive; the latter is cheaper, for le$$. I will absolutely repurchase the Sensitive formula. * Works incredibly well. Mild scent, lightiy whipped consistency. Does take a little longer to rub in because of the consistency. However, it works! Highly recommened"
147,bliss,block star mineral daily sunscreen,pimprod2027018,2584854," * This is the first suscreen ive tried since switching from chemical sunscreen and by far I'm satisfied with how great the wuality is. Its a smooth application, non oily/greasy, AND no white cast (I have light/medium tan skin). Id definietly recommend this product if looking for a mineral suscreen that's non-comedogenic, lightly scented. * This mineral sunscreen has blown me away. It goes on so smooth, does not bead up in heat. After applying it, I don't need to use primer. Amazing product!!! * This is one of my favorite summer products. I use it alone as a skin tint - SO easy and the finish is perfect. But it is tinted to suit fair/medium skin so it's dark on me before I have a tan. Please please please make more shades!! * Not good * I feel like this is a good tinted sunscreen for those that have oily skin. It's thick but doesn't feel moisturizing at all. I live in the desert and do a super juicy skincare routine and have oily skin. Because my skin is beyond drenched, when I put this on last, that dewiness still comes through and I feel like my skin doesn't look massively oily as the day goes on. But again, I'm doing a lot of moisturizing steps before hand. If you're dry or doing light skincare, this is gunna make you look parched. It gives no coverage, but I think it tamps down my redness a little bit. I haven't tried this under makeup. The color looks dark out the tube but on me (light tan) it blends well. Darker skin will probably have a white cast. It does transfer so watch out for your clothes. My main con is the smell. It's like a citrus kitchen cleaner that's heavy on the cleaner part. Not pleasant at all. It goes away, but lordy I hold my breath until then. * My favorite sunscreen so far. I have medium - tan skin so I have a hard time finding sunscreens that dont make me look like I have unblended white on my face. This tint is perfect and not overpowering. This is great for people who want a natural look and sun protection. I dont feel greasy or oily either. * This is my everyday sunscreen. It has a slight tint which is perfect for me even with my fair skin. With this, a little spot concealer, blush, brow tint and mascara, im good for the day. I do set with a light setting powder and it wears beautifully. I purchased almost 4 times already and will continue to do so. Great product"

It flaked on my skin so bad. The first time I used it I used it on it's own and blended it with my fingers and it left flakey streaks on my face. So the second time I used my skincare first and tried to blend this in with a beauty blender and got the same results. Both times I shook the tube well according to the label and got the same results. Very sad this didn't work for me! * After putting it on for a few days (maybe 3). My skin next to my ears starting to breakout. Now anytime I put it on my skin turned hot and itchy like crazy. I love this brand and has other products from them with no issue. Not sure why my skin doesn't like this. * Non greasy sun protection that works well alone and under makeup. Does blend in with your skin color and slightly blurs skin brown spots and blemishes. * Hey Ulta, Dimethicone is a silicone. This product should not come up with your silicone free search filter. * I dont really like SPF's they break my skin out but i do love this one. I wear it under makeup and it does make my makeup a little more oily but i just add a little more setting powder to my routine and dont notice a difference. This product has great ingredients and doesnt break my skin out!! The onlt SPF i'll use * Out of all the brands I've tried through working at Ulta, Dermalogica has the BEST SPF! This one is mineral and blends right into you're skin with no white cast, which is hard to find. Esthetician approved :)"

Keep the sun away. * sensitive skin,  prone to break outs with lots of new products.  this sunscreen was great! * It does the work! No skin burning, no irritation, no strong scent. My husband and my son both work outdoors for a good portion of their jobs and they have no complaints! * Im reading a lot of reviews and honestly yall dont know how to use sunscreen. Why are you spraying it directly on your face and over your makeup. If you are using it on your face spray some in your hands and pat it of your face and also do a patch test when trying new products. Everyone skin is different. * The best sunscreen for me. * I bought this just to use to go to the beach, but the next morning my skin looked so good. I started using it daily as part of my morning routine and I get compliments all the time about my skin. I saw someone didn't like that you couldn't spray directly to the face but honestly as an oily skin girl, it really should be rubbed into the skin, otherwise it just sits on top very dewy. I am at work at 7 and normally oily by 1 but since using this, I have a nice glow but significantly less oily than I am bare faced. I also don't wear makeup to work, drink lots of water, and barely get 6 hours sleep. So I promise you it really is the sunscreen because my habits have gotten worst but my face is still improving from being acne prone and very sensitive. They make a version specifically for face I want to try. * Love this product, i spray a little in my hand and rub into my face, neck, chest and arms for an amazing glow. My coworker kept saying this is something extremely beautiful about your skin…had to share my secret lol"

152,hero cosmetics,force shield superbeam sunscreen apricot spf 30,pimprod2036749,2605374," * I keep buying this. Great for my sensitive acne prone skin. Blends beautifully. I have fair skin but the green sunscreen leaves a cast on me. This one is perfect. * Finding the right sunscreen is so hard, especially when you only want mineral formulas. The one I used for several years got discontinued. I tried SO many before finding this one. I don't have acne prone skin so I had kind of overlooked this brand. It's a decent amount of physical blocker but feels super lightweight and not greasy. I love the slight glow from the apricot tint, no white cast at all. All my usual makeup products sit very well on it with no pilling. And most importantly it seems to do it's job well. Make sure you use enough, you can't skimp with sunscreen! * I have tried all types of mineral sunscreen and most are too drying or too oily. Once this sets on the skin it dries down nicely without being overly anything. I will be repurchasing over and over. The tint looks like it would be too orange but when you put it on it disappears pretty good and just blends in. I add a little concealer and light powder on top and I'm good. This is not a substitute if you want a foundation type coverage. If your skin is relatively nice or you are comfortable, just put it on conceal the areas of concern and go about your day. I think it is good for more mature skin than wants a glow. Powdering does dim down the glow too. Love it! * This sunscreen is completely unusable. As soon as this touched my skin it began pilling and peeling. There were huge spaces on my skin that the product refused to stick to, and the parts it did stick to were a pilling mess. Plus the color is way too orange. The packaging is weird too. It has a pump on it which is completely unnecessary for a squeeze bottle and it makes it difficult to get out the proper amount for the 2-finger method. Do not waste your time or money on this sunscreen. * I am a long time fan of the green version of this SPF. Love how you can get every last bit of product from this packaging, plays nice with makeup, never breaks my very sensitive skin out. Great product, figured I should give this one a go! 

…well, first pump and I just knew this was going to turn me into a jaundiced oompa loompa! But I gave it a whirl just in case. If I wasnt Type I on the Fitzpatrick scale I'd be fine but I could see bits of orange sticking in my eyebrows and onto the dry bits of skin. I did look a bit orange, especially with the anount of sunscreen you are meant to apply for full coverage. Lovely glow finish but it made my foundation look like it oxidized, when it's usually perfect. 

I'll stick with the green version :) * I have combo/oily skin and have been trying various moisturizers with SPF. My skin is also acne prone, so anytime I use a chemical sunscreen I break out. Because this is mineral zinc based, I've seen no breakouts or irritation! The formula is light and easy to apply, and the apricot orange-ish tint surprisingly works fine for my light neutral complexion. Downsides are the pearly shimmer aspect, the slightly tacky feeling, and some pilling near the end of day. I much prefer a matte/natural finish, but if you're going for dewy/glowy you'll probably love this. 

I tried the other Force Shield too, and hate the green aspect since I don't have redness, but love the smoother matte texture more than this one. SO my solution is to split the difference- one pump of each and mix before applying lol! I wish Hero would make two new formulas to add to the collection- one basic like the green but with no color, and one with a lighter apricot/neutral tint and no shimmery stickiness. 

Overall: love the price, no breakouts or irritation, light formulas, mineral zinc; wish it wasn't shimmery or dewy. * Its okay, im on the paler side and this has a tint to it, somit makes me look orange-ish. 
Its also really oily feeling on my skin."
153,black girl sunscreen,make it matte sunscreen - spf 45,pimprod2030390,2592310," * It keeps me from looking extra oily, but it doesn't stay matte all day. * No white cast! This product goes on with ease smoothly so far my favorite sunscreen * I wanted to like this so bad because I tried the mineral formula, but this caused my skin to react so badly that I had to exchange it for something else. * If you're used to slugging or remember when your mother used to put Vaseline on your face in the winter to protect you from the elements then this will give you the same feel. I'm going to use it as a winter moisturizer because it goes on light but becomes really greasy. * I love this product as a black women with melanted skin. I usually had a problem with white over cast, breakouts,and looking ashy. Yet this sunscreen goes on clear and cover my pores. It works as a primer covering all flaws on my face.I have combination skin * I developed really bad photocontact dermatitis when I wore this in the sun. Severe swelling, blisters, red and crusty, itchy skin. Octocrylene ingredient is known irritant apparently. Stick to mineral sunscreens. * I developed skin irritation"
154,supergoop!,mineral sheerscreen spf 30,pimprod2029938,2589387," * I have tried several high end mineral screens, they all leave a white cast, but this one blended properly does not. It does not smell, it is weightless and perfect for use under makeup or on it's own. I go between their mineral face tint and this one, I do not always want or need color. I recommend this line to everyone, and they do NOT test on animals * I've tried all of Goop sunscreen products. I like the way this texture blends into my skin, does not have a strong ordor like Every Single Face or greasy feeling like Unseen. * Got this in the travel size, as it was the tiniest mineral sunscreen I could find. It's fine, but a bit heavy if you use the recommended amount (takes a while to soak into my normal-to-dehydrated skin after skincare) and on a humid day it feels quite cloying. But my big issue is that it smells like rancid peanut butter. Why??? I can't see an ingredient that would cause that smell, but based on other reviews it's normal for the product. There's better out there, unfortunately those brands don't make minis so I'll prepare to smell like peanuts when I travel lol. * This is by far the best sunscreen gor acne probe skin.  Every sunscreen on the market that says ""acne safe"" or ""non comedigenic"" still break me out.  I have VERY sensitive skin and eyes, and this bever burns or stings.  It does what it says it does.  It also does not pill under makeup.  If yoy're a dark skintone, you will HAVE to wear fou dation over this, as it does leave the normal mineral sinscreen white cast. * Its moisturizing and leaves a slight white cast for my POC folks and I havent gotten sunburnt while on it. Doesnt feel too heavy but you'll notice it on your face. No chemically smell and doesn't make my eyes sensitive. Its good under makeup. Haven't tried it in water. Great for folks with combo, dry, or normal skin types. It does what it says it does, but nothing magnanimous especially considering the price and quantity. Other sunscreens at lower price points get the job done the same, if not better. For acne prone skin, Good Molecules and Hero have good sunscreens as well. Otherwise, its worth a try if you want a physical sunscreen. * This formual is amazing. I love the finish it has and I have no textural problems realplying this every 2 hours. Best sunscreen I've ever tried. * I am in shock at the bad reviews 😂 I am a 30 y.o. brownskin black women and this product works perfect for my combination, acne prone skin. Not sure what smell the negative reviews are referring to - if anything it smells very neutral, barely has a smell. I have used other SPFs that I had to wash off and throw away because of the overwhelming smell but that is not the case with this product. As far blending and applying under makeup, it is 100% effective. I think some people are not using it properly or are not prepping the skin properly or the SPF is not compatible with the skincare products others are using. I have used this SPF on top of PCA skin and Face Reality. I have routine appts with my esthetician who introduced me to this SPF and I have never looked back. A little goes a long and if you have a white cast, you more than likely used too much. I sometimes apply too much but I am able to blend it out which removes the white cast. 10/10 for me!"

I put it on my arms, chest and neck before I went swimming each day for an entire week. love how the sunscreen is so easy to apply. The spray nozzle sprays the perfect amount and the bottle itself is easy to take with you anywhere. I don't have to worry about the white streaks of not blending well. It makes it also easy to reapply sunscreen during the day, especially if you're playimg in the water. The lightweight formula is non greasy and works efficiently! A summer must have! * Smells great & lightweight, non-sticky. I applied this  for two days only on my face. The third day I applied to neck, chest , shoulder , arms but unfortunately that evening I developed a heat rash. I obviously have allergy to an ingredient in this specific item and not everyone will have same reaction. I would def do patch test first if concerned. Otherwise I would have continued with product If I didn't have allergy. * I bought this to keep on my car for reapplication throughout the day. It is a fine mist that sprays evenly and layers well over makeup. Exactly what I was looking for!"

I mixed it with a tint, that didnt help either. Here is my leg/foot after a few hours of wear, and I can see where my sandals rubbed it off, but that just shows how crazy the white cast is. Im naturally med-tan skin. * Leaves my face feeling so greasy and doesnt absorb into skin. I'm left with my face looking paler than the rest of my body. * Its so thick that it would not absorb no matter how hard I rubbed it in and it made my legs loom straight up WHITE. I felt like I rubbed toothpaste all over myself. * My dermatologist recommended this mineral sunscreen. I was previously on la roche posay spf face moisturizer but since it wasnt mineral, my doc wanted me to switch. Instant horrible white cast which was quite comical. It smells like rubber tires. I broke out in a rash by day 2, my skin feels like reptile skin. Took a break on day 3 but on day 4 it burned after i applied it. It pills and was blotchy on my skin. Im officially done with this spf. * Has a white cast that just doesnt rub in. Not worth the hassle * Does not absorb into my skin. Makes my face look very greasy * I mistakenly only brought this to a wedding. Im very fair but it was so white and sticks on everything. Left a terrible residue. Will transfer onto your clothes. It felt like you could rub it in for hours and it still wouldn't be any better."
158,la roche-posay,anthelios spf 30 cooling water lotion sunscreen,pimprod2043471,2620125," * Ive given this sunscreen many chances and everytime it gets into my eyes. It burns for a while too. As soon as you use a towel/rag to soothe your eyes a minute later they'll start burning again. This can happen for hours. Wanted to love this because it doesn't leave a white cast if you rub it in enough, but the eye burning isn't worth that. * i bought this in store at the beginning of summer after an employee recommended it to me. i'm a natural redhead, so im pretty pasty and prone to skin cancer/burning easy. i was hesitant because it was super pricy - but a little goes a long way!!! i work outside in the sun all day and have every day for the summer, and i havent burnt ONCE since buying and actively using this. i still have over half the bottle after 2/3 months. it is so worth the money. * I really wanted to like this BUT I've used it a few times and for some reason, after about an hour, even though I'm not sweating, this sunscreen starts to get in my eyes and even my mouth! Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation. It has Benzophenone in it, which can cause contact  dermatitis. I get an allergic reaction on my eyelids every time I've used this product. * OMG this is the best sunscreen I've found for my skin, it's refreshing and soft and doesn't leave your skin white or thought of it. I loved it * Goes on white but leaves no white cast on brown skin after rubbing it in. I love how the spray disperses the product evenly. I dont recommend using it on your face directly though. Steep price for an average sunscreen. * This sunscreen is great. I have very oily acne prone skin and this rubs in well and does not make me greasy at all unlike other sunscreens."

160,kopari beauty,bright as day sheer mineral sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2045118,2623888," * I bought this with high hopes. However every time I use this, there are gritty bits in it. Not tons but like 5 grains of sand every use. I will not repurchase. Also stings/irritates my eyes. * I personally love this sunscreen. People are complaining about the scent, it is not that bad and goes away after it dries. Its a sheer sunscreen that leaves you glowing. If you are not into the ""glowing"" look I would not recommend this sunscreen. I don't have any problems with grittiness, its smooth for me. * Love this sunscreen! 
I was looking for a healthier option over a chemical sunscreen.  Yes it does have an odor when first applying, but it does go away fast. It also has a few tiny bits of grittiness to each application. Be sure and shake it thoroughly. Apply your skincare beforehand as a mineral suncreen can be a bit drying if you are on the dryer side. My tinted moisturizer and makeup layers nicely over it. As an esthetician of over 35 years I'd recommend daily for skin protection. * This is perfect for me. I use it under my foundations. I don't get any bad smells. To me it smells like nothing. The first time I wore it, my husband commented on how pretty my skin looked that day. SPF 50, I love it! * This has what feels like grains of sand in it, and they don't dissolve on your face. I'd share a picture if it was possible. It also has a bad smell. I will never buy this again. * This is a great Isdin dupe. It's very similar and more cost effective. It goes on nicely and spreads evenly. It did not make my face break out which is a plus. If I didn't get it on sale I might not want to spend that much money on a sunscreen though. * The smell is horrible. It does go away but I dont like gagging during my facial routine. And the glitter is way too much."

The tint is perfect and blends right into your skin. Non olily and no smell. * looks good on the skin, but they use too much fragrance which leaves my eyes watering for 15-25+ after putting it on.

I like that it had a nice smell that lingered but was not too strong.  I am trying to get better with wearing sunscreen and often times the smell of it makes me not want to wear it. I also generally dislike the oiliness of most sunscreens.  I will say that this product was better than most at covering up the ""sunscreen smell.""     But you still could smell it which is why I gave it a 4 not a 5.   As far as feeling oily or heavy on your skin, it did not rub in as easily as I would have liked it too and it still did feel a bit oily, as if you need to wash it off at the end of the day with a wash cloth.    It was moisturizing to my skin though and I noticed a difference after only using it for a few days. Overall I would recommend it. * absolutely love this coola classic sunscreen. It's spf 70. It's also 70%organic, cruelty free,fluten free,vegan, and hawaii reef compliant!!! This sunscreen is scented peach blossom and smells sooo good!!! This sunscreen is perfect indoor and outdoor and for all seasons. I highly recommend this sunscreen for sun lovers!!! * I have been using it for a week now and I can say that I really like it: it has a pleasant smell, it absorbs well and does not leave white marks, it is ideal for tanning
This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review * The best smelling and moisturizing sunscreen ever. Just purchased some for summer birthday gifts. * I'm not usually bothered by scents, but this one just smells weird to me. Its like chemical peach, so i would rather just a normal sunscreen scent. Other than that, it's actually pretty good. It blends in well and provides good coverage (I havent been burnt while using it). * First off I love the scent of this cream! It smells like a creamsicle! I have been using it for the past 7 days and I like the fact that it's organic, uses all natural ingredients, and doesn't leave white streak marks and it stays all day. I am very pleased think I found my new one for the summer! I like how it absorbs into the skin and doesn't build up like some of the others I've used in the past. I also love the fact that it's cruelty free and vegan and has a lot of healthy ingredients such as Prickly Pear Extract, Raspberry Seed Oil, and Buriti Oil. And safe for the environment and Hawaii Reef Compliant so unique and I'm so happy to try such a lovely product. Definitely I recommend and will look at other products from the COOLA family!! * First off I absolutely love this. I love that it's not oily or sticky like most other sunscreens. This product is by far one of my favorite sun screens. One thing about this sunscreen is you can barely even tell you are wearing it and it honestly feels hydrating, this is perfect for anyone that is outside a lot or looking for the perfect sunscreen to protect your skin from sun burn and damage! The scent isn't overpowering and as a mom this is my go to sunscreen and I've noticed that it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated! This product is a must have if you're looking for sunscreen that doesn't smell over powering and leaves your skin feeling hydrated but also protects your skin from sunburns and damage ! I highly recommend this sunscreen!

The only downside is the price for the size youre getting, but otherwise I love this product and will be buying it again. * I love the texture and feel of this sunscreen and it doesn't cause acne for my very sensitive skin. Downside is it goes quickly and the price point is too high. * I have sensitive, dry skin. I'm newer to using sunscreen daily. I researched many brands and this had great reviews, so I bought it hoping for the best. Using it over my serums has helped them work their magic. My dark spots have eased up and my expression lines are less prominent. My skin is more hydrated and plump. I plan to keep using this because ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" and it works perfectly for me!

I have extremely sensitive skin and it sits on top of my other skin care products very well. This is also the first sunscreen that hasn't irritated my skin or burned my eyes which I truly appreciate because every sunscreen I've worn in the past had an extremely painful reaction on my eyes.

I have more fair to light skin and it is a little dark for me and therefore makes me skin almost look worse. it doesn't seem to even out any redness just makes it look like I have patchy darker skin tone in some areas. the finish is natural and glory and it's beautiful, but after wearing for about an hour or two the tint is almost all gone in some spots and looks so patchy. * So far this is the best mineral sunscreen I have found, yes even better than Tachas's. Tachas dries my skin and made it flaky eww. This stuff makes it moist reducess just as promised and keeps my face from sunburns. I don't like that at first when first applied my skin looks shiny but I prefer that to the dry film others leave and ive noticed that onces it has time to soke into my skin its fine. * I definetly recomend this as onenodnthe best mineral tinted sunblocks I be ever found. * Best spf!

I've done my research and know that mineral sunscreens are generally considered more effective than chemical sunscreens, but most mineral sunscreens leave a white cast, pill under makeup or over skincare, or leave my skin dried out by the end if the day. 
This Peter Thomas Roth tinted sunscreen is the first sunscreen I have used that doesnt do any of that. It's the most cosmetically elegant sunscreen I've found as it applies like a blurring, color correcting primer. The tint is a neutral tone with a slight yellow hue I would say. It is so much nicer than the other tinted sunscreens I have tried that leave me with an orange or pink coat on my face. It dries down to a satin matte finish, and most of my makeup products layer nicely over it. The only reason it loses a star is I find it settles under my eyes and makes my IT Cosmetics bye bye under eye concealer (a reliable holy grail concealer for me) crease under my eyes by the end of the day. It's likely only noticeable to me, but that's my only complaint. If you're better at setting your undereyes than I am, this will probably check all of your boxes. I've definitely found my go-to sunscreen. * I have searched high and low for a high spf that ALWAYS pairs well with other skincare products and/or with makeup without pilling. This does the perfect job. I wear it alone or it is a perfect base before makeup. I've repurchaed it 3 times and will continue to do so. * I like this but it's too greasy. I also use Bliss Blockstar which I love but the color is too dark for my fair skin and leaves it with a weird ""pink-orange"" cast & the SPF isn't as high. I found this because my skin is sun sensitive/heat reactive and mineral sunscreen is far superior for me. Greasy blobs came out the first time I used it and afterward it made my skin feel greasy. I also don't like the Vitamin C but only because my skin is acid sensitive. So get rid of the excess grease and Vitamin C and it's a keeper!"
173,murad,correct & protect broad spectrum spf 45| pa++++,pimprod2031643,2592791," * This serum has good healthy ingredients but the mineral sunblock that is in it ruins the whole serum. The serum will not melt into your skin. Then if you put makeup on over it, the makeup will not apply evenly and the makeup sits on top of your pores and fine lines and accentuates them! This serum also was not as greaseless as I had hoped. It was a little greasy. So I don't recommend this serum at all. The sunblock in it is 17% Zinc Oxide. That is most likely the reason it never melts into your skin. The price is also very expensive. * It blends into the skin without any white cast but I feel it doesn't get absorbed easily, feels greasy and uncomfirtable on my skin. I can't get past the fact that it feels tacky on the skin for such a long time. For the price point, I'm sure there are much better product out there . * sensitive enough on eczema prone skin during the summer time! * Had high hopes but, after using the full bottle, I did not see any ""Correct""ing benefit. BThey should take this word out of the name, it is misleading.  Also it smells a bit unpleasant which mostly dissipates.
It did give me sun protection but I can get that from a much less expensive product.
Overall a disappointment. * I am a very tan latina who has gone through tons of sunscreen trying to find one with no white cast that actually gives protection. While the price point is steep, it is 100% worth it. You can't go wrong with any of Murad's sunscreens. Love this more than the hydrating purple one because that one smells awful! * Product causes white casting. * This is the first sunscreen I have used that is in the texture of a serum. I like that because it has the consistency of a serum it is not very thick and applies easily. I didn't think this felt greasy but I have used many mineral sunscreens and am used to the way they wear. If you are not you may not like the way it feels on the skin. I felt this product absorbed well and didn't just sit on top of my skin."
174,pacifica,vegan collagen every day lotion spf 30,pimprod2017151,2566493," * We accidentally ran out of this, and we will never take this product for granted again! * It was just too greasy it started to break my skin out * I generally love Pacifica and have only purchased vegan/cruelty free products for the past 30 or so years. My usual store didn't have Andalou SPF face lotion anymore, which I've used religiously and happily for many years, and this was the closest alternative. I have never had a bad reaction to any lotion but this one irritates my eyes horribly, to the point of not being able to drive safely and having to wash my face and flush my eyes. Do not recommend! * I love this brand and I was excited to find a daily moisturizer from them with spf and even went through several bottles but I had to stop using it because it caused my eyes to burn and water profusely. I would also add that it has a very oily finish, so if you have oily or combo skin, this likely isn't for you. * I've used this through a couple of bottles. My skin takes time to adjust to products (hence why the couple of bottles). 

I love that it is cruelty free and has vegan collagen. I love that it has SPF 30, a must for me, BUT it smells like sunscreen. It is definitely moisturizing, I don't have an issue with dry skin, BUT it's rather greasy. My daughter has even commented that my face is really greasy when I wear it (not really the vibe I'm going for). The chemicals burn my eyes as the day goes on. If I even wipe my eyes, it takes me minutes to wipe away whatever traces of this moisturizer is around my eyes. If I regularly wore makeup, this would be extra problematic. If you wear contacts, I do not recommend this. Imagine that burning getting caught up under your contacts.

I really, really wanted to love this because I didn't want to go through having my skin adjust to a new product, but I can't justify it based on it being a habit. * As mentioned by others, this would be more accurately described as ""SPF 30 sunscreen with collagen."" Smells exactly like a normal drugstore sunscreen. It's light and doesn't feel too greasy (but there is still a bit of that feeling). Overall it's ok * Just finished my bottle and ordered another one.  I have sensitive, adult cystic acne, 44 yr old skin that is in the normal to dry stage. This product:
1) has a sunscreen like feel to it when you first apply it, then it fades away
2) has a great glass bottle that you can get ALL of the product out of!
3) Spreads well- at little goes a long way- to much will make it sticky and it won't dry down fast
4) plays well with Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid serum and PUR love your selfie foundation."
175,shiseido,travel size ultimate sun protector lotion spf 60+,pimprod2043992,2622105," * I love it. I have dry sensitive skin, according to my estechian, with freckles no white cast( im poc), lightweight just that price tag so i don't buy as often as i should. * I got this online, i have never tried it before. it inmidiately sting my face really bad, is extremely oily my skin did not absorve it not even after wearing it for hours, i have tried all types of spf from cheapest to medical grade brands this is the worst spf i have ever purchased. * Have been using Shiseido Ultimate Sun Protection Lotion Broad Spectrum SPF 50+ WetForce mineral sunscreen (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) for many years and they just discontinued it. Very upset about that, it was super effective, the slight white cast faded to clear within a minute, and it kept sun spots at bay. No eye stinging even if water ran into eyes. Tried this as a replacement even though it has the chemical components that I'm trying to avoid. This product goes on oily and stays very oily all day (and I have dry skin- it's definitely the product.) It made me break out on the chin and I am over 50. It's also heavily scented, so much that the scent never goes away. I can't emphasize enough how strong this perfume is, more than any facial product I've ever used. If even a smidge gets in the eyes it burns. Hate this and will be returning. I'm not even sure it's effective because after applying in the morning and spending several hours in the car driving, I came home to brown spots/freckles on the face.  Don't understand the good ratings at all unless people are using it on their body but it's not good for the face! * I have tattoos on my arms, and I have found this has been the best! I have had it since the begining of this year, and this sunscren has been great for me. I have combination skin, and it hasn't felt greasy on my skin, although I can understand if it may feel that  way initially. It does have a slight fragrance, so if that's something that bothers you that is something to take note. Great deal as you really don't need to use too much of the product for it to work and it lasts longer for me. Highy recommend especially for vacation! * I wear elta md and and I put this product before  when Im out walking my dog everyday. It has really helped with less sunspots on my face and helps with not making my hyperpigmentation worse. Cant live without! Love the glow it gives as well. * Pros….
GREAT glow to the skin
Protects face from sun
Cons… 
strong grapefruit? Scent 
Feels very oily on the skin
Maybe feels light weight to some but not for me * Burns eyes"

Literally so white and even with 5 minutes of rubbing it into your skin, your skin is grey with stripes of whote because it does not absorb. I have medium tan skin and it makes me look ill. Save your money! * This product is horrible if you have any skin tone except fair. Literally so white and even with 5 minutes of rubbing it into your skin, your skin is grey with stripes of whote because it does not absorb. I have medium tan skin and it makes me look ill. Save your money! * Used this on a trip to Hawaii (this is a reef safe sunscreen) - my kids used it when they went snorkeling. It does leave a white cast on skin, but that is to be expected considering the active ingredients and the high SPF. They came back from the snorkeling trip with a nice tan (we have naturally olive skin, so we tan even with sunscreen) and no burns. I use this regularly on my face to boost the SPF from my daytime moisturizer. It does not feel greasy and it doesn't appear shiny at all. There is an almost imperceptible (not visible in photographs) white cast, but I can live with that. I also use it on the backs of my hands and arms to prevent a ""car tan"" and it has worked well for that so far. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and I would buy it again. * Do not buy! I'm actually headed to Ulta right now to return this. It'll leave a white cast on any skin tone! And it doesn't blend into the skin no matter how much you rub it in. It's also really dry feeling. Skip this product all together.! * I gave this product one star because it does protect from the sun. But I hated everything else about it. It does not absorb it just sits on top of the skin and it's so white. It's very thick and took a long time to apply. It gets all over everything. Not just your clothes, but anything else you touch or bump into. And it is just as difficult to remove from your skin at the end of the day. I threw this product away after using it a few times. * This is the worst sunscreen I have ever tried. It has a weird, gritty texture and is so hard to rub into the skin. It's also super thick and leaves a very noticable white cast. * A truly reef-safe sunscreen for very, sensitive skin that did not leave a white cast on my dark complexion. It can get white when wet but goes away quickly as you dry. I loved it and it kept my skin soft."

180,sun bum,original glow spf 30 sunscreen lotion,pimprod2030636,2592174," * I've been using this daily for a little over 2 years now. For reference, I have incredibly sensitive and acne-prone skin. While the glow is nice and it is great for SPF, it broke me out because of one ingredient (bismuth). In the new year I am trying to remove all skin irritants and unfortunately I will not be able to repurchase this product. * I like this sunscreen, it is light and absorbs easy and leaves a really nice glowy finish. The downside is that it STAINS clothing and does not wash out. I realized this a little late, and I'm stuck with a bunch of shirts that have a brown stain around the collar and sleeves. The packaging also sucks, the product runs out the top often and spills out. * amazing! but the packaging sometimes leaks out of the bottle into the cap. otherwise i am so obsessed!! 🦍☀️ * I want to love this sunscreen, but the packaging is such a deal breaker that I can't justify purchasing it anymore. The screw-on cap does not work with how quickly the liquid product flows out of the tube. The formula would make so much more sense with a pump dispenser or some other type that would prevent mess when using it. I have to believe that the packaging hasn't been improved in order to keep the price low, but it just defeats the cost benefit when I waste product becauss too much flows out. I'd pay a bit more for this product if I could use it without wasting it. I won't be purchasing again unless the packaging is updated based on customer feedback. Sunbum, please fix this! * I've tried quite a few different sunblocks for my face, and they all feel way too thick and make my face feel oily. This is my absolute favorite that I've ever used! It leaves such a nice glow and honestly makes my skin look great. I want to try wearing it as a daily sunblock, but am a little worried that daily use will cause my skin break out, but I guess that I won't know until I try! I do wish they made this in a bigger bottle so that it could be used for the entire body. * I don't know why i keep trying to like sun bum products. They're all mid or below. This sunscreen is basically a liquid. I was expecting more of a lotion type of formula. It is very runny, so when you go to dispense product, be careful and don't squeeze- otherwise you'll make a mess. * IT ACTUALLY WORKS ON ALL SKIN TONES AND COLORS.
I LOVE this sunscreen it is moisturizing while providing sun protection and a BEATIFUL GLOW. It works well under makeup also. I do recommend applying an actual moisturizer on with it because it works as dew drops. It provides great protection.
I rate it 10/10."
181,sun bum,daily 50 face lotion,pimprod2043279,2619924," * Great daily sunscreen
Feels just like a mosturizer
Would definitely recommend for those like me with texture and scent sensetivities. I haven't found any other sunscreen this great! * I don't consider myself to have sensitive skin- acne prone, yes, but not sensitive. I can throw everything but the kitchen sink at my skin when it comes to exfoliating and my skin takes it beautifully. I used this product daily for about a month and started to see some irritation. Thought it was maybe the change in seasons or my other actives. I cut back on those products and the irritation got worse. Started to look like a rash / dermatitis thats caused by heavy moisturizers. Didnt even think thats it was the sunscreen until it was literally the only ""new"" product on my face. Went back to look at the product more closely. Contains coconut oil, which as an acne prone girly, I know this is very comedogenic / clogs pores / causes dermatitis. Sad because I liked everything else about the product- price, packaging, consistency, absorption, efficacy. Just doesn't work for my skin. 😞 * I started using this sunscreen and I genuinely do like the way it feels on my face and has a pleasent scent! It does protect well considering I was outside for hours and my face did not burned however, if it got into my eyes (just from me rubbing or from sweating) and it would continuously keep burning my eyes. 

I really want to like it however, I may switch back to bare republic mineral sunscreen since I had no issue with that."

It leaves a beautiful glow and deeply hydrates but again, not for oily skin or if you leave in hot weather.Too heavy for a day cream * I got this product with high hopes. It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy.

I literally hated putting it on my face. And if that wasnt bad enough, it stayed wet for hours. What the brand calls 'illuminating' looks oily to me. I wish this had been in stores to try before buying as I could have saved having to return it. * First of all, I did NOT receive this product for free. I paid for it with my hard earned money, so my review is legitimate. I like this suscreen! I was previously using Murad's mineral SPF religiously, but that came with a more expensive price tag so I figured I'd give this one a try. I like this one better. While it does not have titanium dioxide like the Murad, it does have a higher concentration of zinc. I like the texture, consistency and glowy effect of this product. The fragrance is a bit much and can be overwhelming when first applied. I would (and will) repurchase. * This product applies well, has excellent ingredients for my preferences. The pull off cap needs a grip of some sort. The consistency and tint are great for me. It is wet though. It goes on wet feeling and stays wet. Not like an oil. * I live in Florida and am obsessed with sunscreen year round.  I am a believer yhat its the most important part of any skincare routine. I try anything new that cones put and have my favorites for different scenarios.  But, this, by kate sommerville is my new overall favorite.  Its a fluid like cream with a slight tint but I wouldn't consider it tinted.  It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any residue.  It made my skin glow, hence the illuminating.

I dont really recommend it as a setting spray but as a suncreen it is a great product to use over makeup. * it was nice to use * greasy and sticky. * I have NEVER had a setting spray completely DESTROY my make up until now. Total waste of money. There's no setting properties to this spray it's quite literally just spraying regular SPF 50 on your face. * couldn't get past the chemical smell or stickiness on my face. did not like the product * While I want to love this as an easy means to reapply sunscreen throughout the day specifically designed for the face, it breaks me out. Its small enough to be relatively travel friendly and the spf aspect works great, I've brought it with me to reapply many places and for all over my body as well as others and everyone who i know thats used it hasnt had any issues with it's effectiveness, i cant use it if it breaks me out. Im not prone to breakout at all. I think its the fragrance, im not a huge fan of the scent either. All in all, if fragrance doesnt affect you id maybe suggets giving it a try however there are other similar products on the parker that dont cause issues. * SO greasy and smells terrible.

As an adult i would not use this on my face i prefer the unseen sunscreen! * I used this sunscreen last summer, and I was very happy with it. It definitely protected me and I was happy to see that it really wasn't noticeable on my Fitzpatrick type 2 skin.
It also doesn't burn eyes. It have sensitive skin, and it didn't give me acne or rash. 
It is very easy to apply and reapply.
I hope they keep this formula. * Product leaves a white cast, made me breakout in a rash almost right away and I dont usually have sensitive skin. It also smells bad, like clay. Had to throw away, definitely not compatible with my face. * the smell is disgusting. I used only a few times and couldn't stand the smell. * Don't buy this. It's Thick and makes your makeup look horrid. This is great if you're at the beach with no makeup and you don't care what you look like. * Absolutely love this product! First reason being, it's 100% mineral! I personally gravitate towards sunscreen sticks because they are convenient, great for throwing in my purse & using as needed while being mess free. Although mineral, this formula is not drying AT AL & does not leave a white cast! It does have a heavier feel when directly applied but absorbs well once worked into the skin. I have dry skin so I do not mind the more hydrating formula. It is also great for sensitive skin! Does not break me out, burn my perioral dermatitis & does not burn the eyes. This formula is long lasting & withstands the heat! Cannot say enough good things about this one! * Since this is a zinc oxide-based sunscreen it will leave a white cast, but not as bad as our other favorite Neutrogena Baby cream.  I have a very fair child who goes to outdoor summer camp and this is great as it is water-resistant and doesn't run/sting the eyes."

It provides a lovely, refreshing boost to your skin, especially on hot, sunny days. The formula is lightweight and non-greasy, leaving no sticky residue or shine on the skin. What's more, it's perfect for indoor use, as it doesn't contain high levels of sunscreen, yet still offers numerous benefits. I'm particularly fond of the fact that this product is vegan, cruelty-free, and made with clean, organic ingredients. Overall, I highly recommend it. Additionally, its compact size makes it perfect to take on the go, fitting nicely in your purse or clutch. Although it's a bit pricey for my liking, considering it's a sunscreen product, I believe the clean ingredients used by this brand justify the cost. ""This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review,"" * I'm so sad! I used to LOVE this product. It would give me the most beautiful dewy finish and smelled amazing. I just bought a new bottle yesterday in-store and it's completely different. The smell is similar but not nearly as good, the moist is not as fine, and IT DOESNT HAVE A DEWY FINISH!!! It just seems like I spraying water in my face now with no other benefits. * I love this brand, but I would not buy this again. I have purchased this 3 times (for myself and family), and all 3 times the bottle has leaked all over my bag, and wasted money. Get the lotion and save your money. * I sprayed this on my face before driving home from work and within 20 minutes my eyes were stinging and burning. Im guessing it migrated into my eyes. Also the coconut fragrance lingers on your face for a long time. Really disappoint overall and cant wait for my eyes to stop burning. * It's a light mist that does feels slightly sunscreeny- but not too much that it turns me away from it. I have oily skin and I hate using face spf for that reason so I wanted to try this instead. I like the light feel and it didn't irritate my skin. * I like that it doesn't have alcohol or a smell like the setting spray version but it is pretty oily when applied. Also wish the SPF was higher. I went though the bottle quick since I kept reapplying before I noticed how oily it made me. It would be great for dry skin girlies. * I think there are better spray sunscreens on the market for a better price. I'm really debating on returning this. I've used it three times, and each time I'm happy with the glow, but it very quickly turns to grease and my makeup slides off. I think for the price, you're better off getting something else. Also, the packaging is pretty but it's not practical. I bought this to put in my pool bag and my hiking pack, but it's glass packaging… I get making sustainable packaging but this isn't practical for what I'm using it for."
188,neutrogena,"sport face oil-free lotion sunscreen, spf 70+",pimprod2032290,2595050," * I began using this sunscreen years ago and like others, am not a fan of the new motor oil smell of the current formula.
I continue to use it because, although the smell is terrible, the formula remains effective and keeps me from burning in intense sun and it's modestly priced for an oil free sunscreen that's high in SPF protection. That's what keeps me coming back. 
Keep in mind, this is a sunscreen lotion and not advertised to be a daily moisturizer. I use another SPF product by the same brand for daily use. I only apply this product prior to outdoor activities. * This is my tride and true. It looks fabuslous on its own and underneath makeup. There is a slight white cast that is eliminated with enough blending. I also notice it helps lessen the amount of sweat thats produced on my face. I workout everyday in an unconditioned gym in the south, need i say more?

This is it * I hate this sunscreen. I thought it would have a flawless finish like all the korean chemical sunscreens I like. It leaves a white cast on my face as if it were a mineral sunscreen and does not completely rub in no matter how much I work it in. And then it does not dry fully either, it just sits on top of skin. Surprisingly, it doesnt make foundation pill, so that gets a star. I will not repurchase. * I didnt get a sunburn but it is very hard to rub in so you need to apply alot of product. * I used the old version for years and it was nearly perfect; hydrating, easily spread, and non irritating. The new version takes a lot of work to spread in, leaves a white cast on my skin(nc45), clings to hairs, and isn't hydrating enough. * I've tried a few sport sunscreens and this is one of my favorites. I wear it everyday before my workouts to protect my skin outdoors and indoors from harmful UVA/UVB rays. I sweat a lot and it doesn't burn or sting my eyes which is a plus. One of the cons I have to note for others is, it is a little bit thick and greasy like a lot of sunscreens, but that doesn't really bother me personally. * Leaves you with a white cast after trying to rub it in."

skin: combo-oily
makeup: yes, and I double cleanse and prep skin.

I've been trying this sunscreen for some time now. While I can say it feels nice on the skin, it unfortunately broke me out quite a bit. For one, it is relatively fragranced, which I'm not usually opposed to but can see this being an issue for some. I do wear it underneath my makeup after i've prepped my skin and give it enough time to try, but have noticed that by the end of the day I significantly more oilier than if I prepped my skin without it. I don't doubt that the sunscreen doesn't allow my skin to breathe nearly as much, but I probably wouldnt recommend this product to someone who is looking to apply it under makeup or have sensitive to oilier skin - which is unfortunate as I was hoping the serum aspect of the product would have been better for my skin type compared to a thicker mineral type sunscreen. Overall, its not ""bad"", just not for me! * i got this for free and i was very excited to try the brand. while it had a great feel on the face, i did not like the white cast that it left. i decided that even though there was a white cast, i was going to purchase it when i ran out until i noticed the price. there are sunscreens out there that do the same thing for a fraction of the price. im not willing to pay almost $50 for a sunscreen. * I did not expect much from this sunscreen at all, honestly. I usually stick with Asian sunscreens as they have exceptionally elegant lightweight formulas with filters far more advanced than those you can find in the US. I got a sample of this, however, and was genuinely surprised by the formula and how it felt on the skin. For reference, I have oily-combination skin, so a light SPF is a must. This sunscreen definitely fit its description of a gel serum- I would say that's definitely how it felt going on (maybe a tad bit more of a gel cream, but still quite light, regardless), and in my experience, it sinks in quite quickly while still leaving the skin feeling the skin hydrated and moisturized. I don't typically use moisturizer when I use this, but that's just what works for my skin personally. I have very sensitive eyes and this also did not sting my eyes at all when applied around my eye area, which is a huge plus for me as that can turn me off from a sunscreen completely. Different things work differently for everyone so I would still recommend getting a sample and trying before spending this much on a sunscreen, especially as there are lots of incredible SPFs that are MUCH more affordable, but finding a sunscreen thats actually enjoyable to use can be extremely hard so I definitely appreciate finding one (a US sunscreen, at that) that feels this nice and would absolutely recommend.

***This was purchased with my own money. This is NOT a sponsored review in any way and all opinions are my own. * I'm always on the hunt for a sunscreen for my face that doesn't feel sticky and hot.  This one isn't quite the naked feel I'd like, but I think it's the best I've found so far.  Unfortunately the cap won't come off so I have to screw off the top to access the product.  I'm assuming there's a pump under the cap which would really be convenient, but I'm going to have to pour the product into my hand.  Disappointed in this defect for the price of the product. * I love that this doesn't smell like sunscreen.  It is light for this oily skin girl, doesn't make me oilier.  Small bottle."

And it doesnt rub into the skin. * Do not buy this product. It was so bad it was on special and now i know why. Leaves a white cast, is greasy, and doesn't absorb into the skin at all * I absolutely hated this sunscreen. Worst white cast ever, you cant make it go away no matter how much you rub it in you will still go down 3 shades once you put it on. since I have sensitive skin I thought I would try out this brand but it made my skin issues worse. Also, not a great sunscreen to wear if you are planning on getting in bodies of water. I should have looked at reviews first before buying do not make my mistake. 
L * Stains everything white and doesnt ever absorb. I feel dirty for the rest of the day and look like I'm covered in lead paint makeup. Can not express how much I hate this sunscreen. * Horrible product. Leaves a white residue on the skin even after 12 h of application. Buy only if you wanna look like a clown * I'm highly upset with this sunscreen as I brought it on vacation to use after I used up my other one. I put it on expecting it to be better than my Neutrogena one but it is 10 TIMES WORSE. My legs look white as a ghost. BUY ANOTHER SUNSCREEN!!! * Super greasy and leaves a really bad white cast!"

I will be returning this. * Great protection from sun with 20% zinc oxide! * It leaves a white cast, * I wanted to love this sunscreen since I love Dermalogica products but it does have a heavy greasy feel once applied on your face. Unfortunately, I will be returning this. I have a medium complexion and combination skin. It did not leave a white cast. * Estoy feliz de averiguar encontrado ente producto soy alérgica al sol y necesitaba encontrar un protector físico estaba desesperada por mi alergia micara y cuello y brazos llenos de ronchas no sabía la diferencia entre físico y químico cada año iba a emergencias por los granos odio tomar medicamentos ahora estoy con mi bolsa vacía pero sin granos gracias dermalogica * This suncreen is….def something makes me feel rlly greasy take forever to blend if you want a fast absorbing sunscreen this one is NOT for you it literally takes a whole day for it to feel somewhat not greasy on your face, dont get me wrong i have sensitive skin and i like how it didnt break me out BUTTTT  THE WHITECAST IS INSANE, im the whitest dominican there is to exist and it got me over looking purple😵‍💫 theres so many better options for cheaper😭 atp im just using it to cope with the fact that i spent that much money on it, your better off buying the la roche posay sunscreen * Gifted by Dermalogica. This product was nice. It was a little sample size but it did the trick. Felt nice going on my skin and very smooth. Might have to get the larger size of this next time for summer"
192,coola,zinc oxide liplux sunscreen trio,pimprod2013049,2562546," * No overwhelming bad taste.  Nice colors.  Lasts waaay longer than other products I've tried.  Offers effective sun protection.  It IS a little drying but only a LITTLE.  I've tried sooo many different tinted sunscreen lip balms.  This one is top quality as far as I'm concerned. * Terrible chalky texture. Colors are not flattering. I'm still searching for a decent spf tinted balm. Tossing these. * These are soooo dry. Feels horrible!! Will be returning asap * The Coral Reef shade didn't come in my set, Firecracker did. I was looking forward to trying the coral shade the most. Just wish the set was actually the colors advertised! I think the formula is decent, but a little overpriced. * I really like thses.  They smell so good, like mint.
Wish they were available in store. * First off I'd like to say that this is the first time I've tried a tinted SPF lip balm! And I really like what I've tried so far! I've tried these for about 10 days and I really like how they feel on my lips. They are very moisturizing, silk texture and made in such pretty colors! My favorite is the Firecracker color. I like how nicely it glides on and doesn't feel cakey nor weighed down. I love the fact that these has SPF and I don't have to worry when I'm swimming at the pool if I get dried out lips. Also love the fact that this is organic, Vegan, and made with natural ingredient's and safe for the earth. Such high quality products and I'd love to test out other lip balm colors and also try other COOLA products! Perfect for the beach! * First off, I've only been using these for about 5 days and I'm absolutely OBSESSED. I love that it comes in 3 different shades and flavors but mainly the variety!

One of the first things I noticed about the lip sunscreen is how well it works, some products it takes a few days of using it for the effects to really work but this worked immediately, usually my lips crack and dry out depending how long I'm outside but this actually hydrated and protected them from cracking or drying out. One of the other things I loved was the fact you can barely even tell your wearing it! It doesn't feel weird or oily or cakey! And the other thing I loved was the fact it came with 3 different flavors! I highly recommend this product for anyone wanting the perfect go to lip sunscreen!!

The scent is horrible and smells old even though it isn't expired. It will ruin your day is you put it on before heading out to the beach/pool because the smell is so awful * The texture is really nice, but the smell is off. Has a stale smell * Coola's sunscreen lotion went on easy and without a greasy, oily film. It lasted well throughout the day, and smelled great! * Put this on before going to the beach and then reapplied, still ended up a lobster. Not a fan unfortunately :( * This product gets the job done. Feels smooth on skin without feeling greasy. I also appreciate the business model of Coola. Scent is not fresh and tropical like piña colada infers. I'll use this again but maybe buy a different scent next time * Like the facial sunscreen  this went on so smoothly, and dried down quickly with no sticky or greasy residue. I haven't experienced any pilling. Smells great, but not too strong. Great sunscreen! * Product was expired and smelled horrible. Will not buy again."

I picked up this one in store because it looked to check all my boxes but when I went to research it more, I saw that licorice root was used and is not safe during pregnancy. If you are not pregnant and looking for a mineral sunscreen with the lighest tint and no white cast then I would recommend this for you! * I have sensitive skin and rosacea and this sunscreen has worked amazing for me! Super light weight and soaks into skin great. Wears really well for me under makeup! * I was super excited to try this sunscreen as I have always heard good things about First Aid Beauty. It didn't burn or sting, it left a slight white cast though. What I had an issue with was the pilling under the makeup. It was so bad! I returned immediately because I had to wipe all the sunscreen off just to even put concealer on. * I struggle to find products that my eyes or skin can tolerate.  I tried this product on a whim and really like it.  It mixes nicely with my weleda products I use. I like the light coverage and glow it gives my skin. * I liked the coverage and shade on my light-medium neutral skin tone. I finished the whole bottle and found it acceptable but would not repurchase for the following reasons: pills under make-up, and also did not enjoy the gritty texture felt when rubbing the product into my face."

The sun protection is solid too, but unfortunately, the 10% octocrylene in the formula makes my eyes teary and uncomfortable. I really wanted to love this sunscreen, but due to the irritation, I have to return it. If you have sensitive eyes, be cautious. Otherwise, it's a good product for sun protection and a radiant look. * I love how well this absorbs and it has no white cast. It also helps in reducing wrinkles and prevents accelerated aging. It's a win win! This non greasy, lightweight formula works great on my sensitive skin. This is also reef safe, sweat & water resistant & super hydrating. I received this free for my honest opinion and am posting here with no obligation. * Beekman 1802 Hello Sunshine SPF 50 PA ++++ is a clinically proven sunscreen for face and body with goat milk and chebula fruit to protect against accelerated aging. Provides daily defense with SPF 50 and the highest PA rating to reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles and prevent future sun damage. I love this sunscreen, it's my go to, the thing I can't live without, and my everyday sunscreen! We all know how important it is to use sunscreen and this is the only one I've found that just melts into your skin! No flakes! No clumps! I would absolutely. recommend this product to everyone because sunscreen is so important for healthy and protected skin. * This sunscreen Is FINALLY what I've been looking for. I am super senstive, dry, acne prone skin and the fact I can put tbis one and not have ANY skin flushing, tingling, or irritation makes me so happy! I put this on everywhere and it does not make my eyes sting or water, YAY! 

I love how lightwieght it is and just seems to blend into the skin immediately. It really feels more like a regular moisturizer that has sunscreen than a suncreen with moisture. 

As an esthetician, this will definitely be what i recommend to my clients! * I have very dry, acne prone, sensitive skin. I've been on the hunt for a sunscreen that doesn't exacerbate any one of these issues. I don't use mineral sunscreens because they don't agree with my dry skin. This sunscreen is almost perfect. It doesn't burn my skin, it doesn't cause any skin flushing, it's hydrating, it doesn't pill, it doesn't break me out. Unfortunately it caused my eyes to sting horribly throughout the day. I really loved this sunscreen at first, and I was so disappointed. I'll continue to use it as a body sunscreen though."
197,kinship,self reflect sport sunscreen spf 60,pimprod2031257,2593029," * Finally a high quality mineral spf that works for my dry skin. I live in hot humid Tampa Florida and I wanted to switch to a mineral based spf. This is an excellent product that I've repurchased 10 times now and will continue to repurchase. Great! * I do not know what magic they put in this, but they cracked the code. I am a medium skinned black woman and there is no white caste, even after working out for an hour! Also, it is so comfortable, it does not feel like you are wearing anything AND it is very moisturizing.  I could not stop touching my face. 
This version is better than the non sweatproof version and the best mineral sunscreen I have ever tried, and I have tried a lot. * This is perfect for your outdoor activities--high SPF , water/sweat resistant with very minimal white cast for a zinc-only sunscreen at that high SPF (give it a little time for the slight white to dissipate-note however that i am fairly pale). I also use this on my neck and chest for everyday wear because it doesnt get ""orange"" tint on my collars and 
clothing like my everyday tinted spf does. It feels moisturizing in the skin. It is very different from kinships spf 30 product although I Highly recommend you try both!! * first one suits my sensitive skin, no more irritation and watery eyes due to sunscreen * I love the other Kinship SPF so I thought I'd give this one a try since it's ""water resistant"" and SPF60. I don't see HOW this is water resistant because it never sets and its continuously greasy, on top of that my skin STILL managed to dry out two hours after I've applied it. It rubs off into everything and if you touch your face at any point in the day (I've worn it for 6+ hours) it moves and gets into everything. I've almost finished the whole tube thinking maybe it's user error... it could still possibly be the case. I'm 30 with rosacea, combination dry skin with hormonal breaks out and a thyroid condition that tends to dry my skin and hair out.. I wanted to like this sunscreen but it's a big no. I can't make it work, I've tried it alone, with moisturizer, under makeup, with serum only. I don't feel protected when I wear this sunscreen. It's also got this iridescence to it that at first I thought I would like but it just makes you look like *shiny* vampire. * After using the kinship self reflect spf 30 for several months, this sunscreen is definately my preference over the self reflect. This sunscreen has a very natural satin finish and is very hyrdating without being greasy, while the self reflect spf 30 has a dewy finish and is more lightweight. It takes about 5 minute after application for it to absorb and the cast to disappear. The long term benefits for my very sensitive combo skin have been amazing. The keratosis bumps on my cheeks have completely disappeared and this is the only product I have change in my routine. It has a very subtle vanilla scent that disapears shortly after application. Also the cast is hardly noticable on pale-medium skin. My friend with dark skin borrowed some and said that even though there was a slight white cast for her, it was surprisingly subtle given how high spf it is. This sunscreen has replaced my foundation at this point because  texture of my skin has improved so much since using it. I wish kinship made a body sunscreen like this. Kinship is a solid clean skincare brand and most of my products are from kinship since they are only of the few brands that cause irritation for me. If you have sensitive combo skin I would especially recommend this brand. * After using the kinship self reflect spf 30 for several months, this sunscreen is definately my preference over the self reflect.

As a natural girlie I feel like I've tried most zinc sunscreens as its all my family and I will use.  Most are soooo very pasty.  This one goes on like butter!  Hydrated and clear.  The ingredients are super clean and hydrating.  I can layer makeup over it easily. * I use this un-tinted spf serum and the tinted one that mad hippie does.  They are both really good.  I like this one because it is waterproof and super moisturizing.  Its the most moisturizing zinc sunscreen I've ever found.  Most zinc sunscreens feel very drying on my skin and accentuate my wrinkles but this one feels like a moisturizer. * I try to only use zinc sunscreen on myself and my kids.  A lot of them are super whitening and feel like you've got something on your skin - yuck!  Not this one.  It goes on super smooth and leaves my skin feeling great.  I wish they would make a bigger bottle that I could use on my whole body. * Bought this because i wanted a sheer tint & light coverage & i love using mad hippie products! 
This one just sadly isnt for me. It completely dried out my skin (and i alraady deal with dry skin!) especially around my forehead and my nose. Im just upset because i spent money on it jusy to use it 3 times before it started drying me out bad! * Never can tell how ones skin is going to react to even the most popular products, but holy moly am I glad I decided to give this a chance. Just started my third bottle. I used La Roche Posay tinyed sunscreen previously, but this is worlds different. Have to work fast to get good distribution, but after a few seconds tapping a tiny bit more on top of any spots needing helps conceal. I use a very light layer of Ulta powder foundation after to set and Rude Cosmetics plump setting spray and let me just say its all survived monsoon rains, summer sweat and does not dry me out in winter so long as I remember to moisturize first. * I like Mad Hippie. But the first ingredient in this is new to me. I got a major neck rash/burn. It took days and days to go away. So painful. I must be allergic to this ingredient. So be careful. * Im in my 50's with normal to dry skin that doesn't like most foundations. My requirements for sunscreen are 15% zinc at least, no hormone altering or toxic chemicals including aluminum, and it cant be heavy and greasy. So finding a mineral spf that looks good is really tough. My skin rejects a lot of products too. But im so happy with this because it passes all of my requirements and it looks natural and has light coverage. Also a sunscreen has to have a minimum of 15% minerals in order to get a true 30 spf and this passes that test too. It truly is a good product. The light color matches me perfectly. I have a neutral undertone, green eyes, pretty fair skin and brown hair. Its also pretty affordable. Because this is so hood I irdered other products by them. People need to appreciate items that dont mess with your hormones. Thise things are in everything these days. In regards to the other review, It's possible to have allergic reactions to literally anything, so just because someone had a bad reaction doesn't mean its the products fault. There's nothing in it that can burn anyone. It's impossible. It's just an allergy. I use only Dior snd Chanel makeup and this is just as good for the days i want sunscreen and a no makeup look. It has some coverage and its not buildable. Its a sun tint."

There are so many great ingredients in this product like hyaluronic acid, coconut water, Jasmine, basil just to name a few.
These great ingredients have helped my skin tremendously.
After using it for just one week,1 have been not using my regular make up but only this sunscreen moisturizer during the day. My skin looks great with no makeup.
It is great to have a SPF that works like skincare in my routine and is helping with the anti aging process to boot. I am definitely going to be using this all year because UV rays are always out and we need to be protected. Thanks for another great product I am a huge fan of this product too.
Product was received as part of an educational promotion. * This doesn't blend into the skin, but rather sits in top and leaves a white cast. If you touch it or try to put anything over it, get ready for major pillong. Youll have to wipe it all off and start over. I also tried mixing it with another sunscreen, bit it still pilled.  Maybe a bit of oil in this product would help?? * Ive got real sensitive and acne prone skin. So any new product I introduce to my face, my skin will let me know it doesn't like it by breaking me out instantly. Usually by the next morning. I could not find a sunscreen that didn't do this. This one didn't! * Did not like this at all. It was okay at first, although sticky, it seemed fine. The white cast wasnt too baf and it eventually went away. After about 6 hrs i had to wash it off bc my skin was getting extremely red, itchy, and dry. I have oily and acne prone skin that i dont consider sensitive. It took a week for my skin to go back to normal and im still recovering from ghe breakouts. * Love how matte my skin looks. It hasn't made me break out unlike other sunscreens. * Very disappointing for a claim won't cause breakouts. Immediately caused breakouts and congestion. Also very drying cracking skin around nose.

It moisturizes my skin and i can lather it on when I'm not wearing makeup. It makes my skin look so healthy. I've turned on 4 of my family members and a handful of friends to this. * The texture is oily and my makeup does not sit well over it. But the worst part about this item is that it smells terrible! * I didn't like the texture and it was grossly oily * I've tried many primers with SPF, and this is my favorite as it actually blurs pores the most and has the highest SPF. It's my daily primer. * I liked this spf until it reached the end. The bottle was very hard to swueeze. I was about to throw it out and decided to cut the package. There was still anton of product left! * It works very well under my makeup and makes my skin look younger. I will definitely buy this product again. * Really nice ,smooth sunscreen.

So glad I came across this holy grail. No white cast amd gives my skin a cute glow when worn alone. Perfect under makeup as well. This is the only sunscreen I will wear * I really wanted to love this sunscreen as I've heard great things about it both alone and under makeup. Unfortunately it never absorbs and pills terribly, under makeup and on its own. Leaves a whitecast as well. I returned it. * I decided to buy this sunscreen after reading the reviews and decided to give it a try. But I have nothing else to say except bad things about it. I have normal to dry skin, so I thought this would be a good fit for me since it's hydrating. However, it peels off instantly and don't even think to wear it under makeup. Plus, it leaves a white cast every time I apply it. I'm pale white. This is a big regret for me. * If you have olive undertones or tan skin in general this is not for you. The white cast is horrible and this sunscreen does not blend well at all. Made me extremely greasy and peely."

I'm glad I got the to sample because i like uneben skin stick, ive been using it for abkjt three weeks and my dar spots on my face and chest ate fading, the tinyed moisturizer worh Spf 20 is ok, but i cant get behind the color corrector. Maybe I'm not patient, or care to take the time to really blend it. Its red, and if you dont take the time for it to set, then build with conceiler then its not going to look good. Im gonna stick with my other fave on that one! I will however, continue to use the dark spot stick! * The orange lip color looks awful. * Happy trial sizes exist of this product. Hyperpigmentation stick was good, glides and blends easily. However no match for my perimenopause dry skin. On anyone else would probably be a moisturizing glow. The SPF was great, blends in and gives a cc type of glow finish. * The tinted sunscreen does leave a slight cast, the color stick is perfect, and the hyperpigmentation serum needs better packaging because you have to dig out the product at end. Overall good value, but wont be purchasing full size items."

Definitely need to get this in a full size. * My skin is fair and acne prone. This sunscreen has been working great so far. I actually have not noticed any new breakouts during the past couple of weeks I've been using this product. I even put it on my arm tattoos. The scent is pleasant, which is great because I hate the smell of sunscreen. Overall I think it's a great daily sunscreen for your face. * to start, spf 25 isnt even enough for your face or body no matter how much you use. I personally have combo skin with dry cheeks and an oily t zone, and this product dries me out! it sits TERRIBLY under makeup, and sweats off too easily. will not be re purchasing. * I bought the sunscreen because I've been on the hunt for a daily mineral 'clean ingredient' face SPF. I previously purchased the Mad Hippie face serum with spf and liked it, but saw this and there was more product for a similar price so I figured I'd give it a go. It is very light and blends easily for a mineral sunscreen, leaving a minimal cast (if at all). It has a very light, negligible scent. I don't wear daily makeup so I can't speak to layering it with other products, but I really like this sunscreen so far. * I didnt fond myself reaching for it a lot. Ive been trying to experiment with mineral sunscreens and while I think this did the job fine, it was very had to warm up in my hanfs out for me, and seemed greasy. 

I feel like this would be the ideal sunscreen for winter with ifs moisturizing properties, but not for summer, at least for me. * Even the smallest amount has left a white cast and flakes. I got a huge zit almost immediately after applying. Will be returning! * I love Mad Hippie but this is not my favorite product so far.

Doesnt smell awful or all. Ive gone through 3 bottles of this about to purchase my 4th. Its so good, try it at least once in your spf journey, i dont think youll be disappointed. * This sunscreen has changed my life! It is the only one that i have wanted to put on my face every single day! It has never made me break out and it makes makeup go on so smooth! Especially under the eyes! Please never stop making this! It is my holy grail sunscreen!!!! * This comment is a public threat to Zitsticka - if you ever discontinue this sunscreen I'm coming for you. I've tried foreign sunscreens with amazing formulations and updated filters and this is just the best one. It has just a small amount of zinc so that it reflects light and leaves you so glowy without it being oily. It gives me no feelings of itchiness (which is something I had come to accept as a given with sunscreens, and my face is still super hydrated. I don't care if y'all shutter your doors, I'll pay to keep this sunscreen on the market. My one hangup is that its packaging is truly horrible, and it was way better as a dropper. Let's try a tube next time! And maybe lower the price! xoxo * I got this during Ultas spring 21 days of beauty sale and initially, I really liked this sunscreen because I liked that it has no fragrance, leaves no whitecast, and I noticed that it didnt break me out. However, its wayyyy too thick and leaves my skin looking so greasy and it takes hours for it to dry down, which is the biggest deal breaker for me. Whatsmore, the bottle kept breaking at the tip and after a while I noticed that there was a slight foul smell to it. Overall, I'm almost done with the bottle but I wouldn't repurchase."
207,vichy,liftactiv peptide-c face sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2013305,2559388," * I am like that this has vitamin C and sunscreen. The lotion goes on easily, but it smells so bad. I will be returning it. * Does not leave white cast, wears good under makeup, I have been using for years now! * Terrible strong perfume scent that caused a rash - will be returning * It is light and smooth, not greasy. It will run into your eyes if you sweat. It has a strong fragrance like men's cologne. I don't know if it is a signature Vichy scent or what, but it is not a fragrance that plays well with others. * My skin is somewhat sensitive. Not many products, including sunscreen, break me out, but the ones that do, REALLY mess me up. This sunscreen broke me out terribly. Not all over the face, but a few cystic blemishes, including one of my nose. I'm still dealing with the scarring from that :( The scent on this is VERY strong. I am not sensitive to scents at all. I don't care when products are scented, but there is no need for it be this strongly scented. What were they thinking? 

I bought this during the beauty days sale so I will keep it and use it on my neck and chest for the anti-aging benefits, but if you are breakout prone from sunscreens, be very careful with this one. * My first time trying out this face sunscreen and it feels nothing like all the others I've tried and used under makeup! This is veil like, smooth application…. BUT!!! The scent! The scent is STRONG and it does not go away even after you applying foundation or bb cream… I really wanted to love this product because of the peptides but im disappointed I will not be using it as I wanted due to the smell. Side note the description does indicate there is a floral scent to it (i missed reading that part) I agree it is a floral scent except it is strong! * I like how this goes on and the potential benefits, however, it irritates my rosacea and makes me redder."
208,kopari beauty,antioxidant face shield mineral spf 30,pimprod2031646,2594644," * I really wanted to like this one, but it's not for me. It has an off putting smell and is greasy so your makeup slides off. Using sunscreen daily is the key to keeping skin young looking. To get the best protection I think the easiest and best is the mists or setting sprays like seriously fab zinc over. If sunscreen is greasy and smells bad, you're probably not gonna wanna do it every day. This one has a long list of chemicals no bueno. * I really wanted to like this but don't understand the hype. It smells terrible, like sand and playdough somehow at the same time. It's not glowy but greasy and doesn't ever dry down, making you feel sticky for hours. The greasiness means makeup also doesn't wear well on top. I tried it for a long time to give it a fair chance (about 1 month) and ended up throwing the rest away. Do not recommend. * This product has an odor that is so horrible, I had to wash my face after application. * I have purchased this product, three times sense trying it… it is a little expensive, but it doesn't break me out, smells good, and it looks beautiful on the skin. * I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to most sunscreens but I can sometimes pull off mineral. This was a winner. The only down side is the smell but worth the 5 seconds. * It does produce a glow but needs higher SPF especially during peak Florida summer * I usually don't leave reviews. But this smell is terrible...it literally smells like trash"
209,vichy,capital soleil tinted face mineral sunscreen spf 60,pimprod2013306,2559390," * I really wanted to like this sunscreen. It dries down matte but it breaks me out everytime I use it. * I like to use mineral sunscreens because they don't sting my eyes, but this one stings my entire face. * It balls up, pills and comes off EVERY SINGLE TIME.
I shake it until the cows come home
I use just ONE moisturizer underneath it
I put it on NAKED skin

It PILLS, without fail * this is my new foundation. 2 in 1 for sure. I am going for a second bottle. * I've used heavy full coverage foundations for almost 20 years. I wanted to add sunscreen and skincare to my makeup. tried several tinted serums, sunscreens, moisturizers, but this one actually has some coverage and gives you a glow. I stopped wearing foundation completely now. this is my daily go to. if I need extra coverage I use a little concealer. I still do my smoky eye and it looks great * Product is definitely oily and even after shaking VERY well, it was still separating and had almost sandlike grains in it. Additionally it was not blendable at all and made my lightly tanned skin look ghostly. Am returning asap. * Love this product!  Fantastic protection and a light moisturizing coverage.  This product does it all."
210,first aid beauty,mineral sunscreen zinc oxide broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2032660,2593738," * Sunscreen is something I've incorporated into my daily skin regimen since I was a tween. This sunscreen goes on sheer and has a subtle non bothering natural fragrance that makes application enjoyable. * I have very oily and acne prone skin, this product saved my skin. I have yet to break out. The bottle also lasts forever, I've had the same bottle for 6 months. Love this product, worth the price. * Recommend to those with sensitive skin as it's a mineral sunscreen. Zinc is good for acne and I didn't break out from this. I dont recommend this for those with darker skin as it may leave a white cast * Not sure how this has so many postive reviews. Its so sticky and tacky. I would not recomend this. * I just jeep coming back too it. I have combo sensative acne prone skin and its just unbeatable! * doesnt leave a white cast, didnt break me out, protexts my skin from the sun, sits well under makeup, feels like a moisturizer, dosesnt pill. this is the beat spf ive ever used and ive been looking for one for so long * This is very difficult to absorb onto skin, it is thick, sticky, and when it transfers into your eyes it is the worst burning and irriating feeling ever and needs to be washed off immediately. I love FAB products but this is NOT it."
211,kiehl's since 1851,super fluid daily uv defense spf 50+,pimprod2002969,2536726," * I have greasy, combo, acne prone, olive toned skin and now use this every day. It feels really great on the skin and does not clog my pores. * It is second time to me to use it because I love it and it's perfect on my skin!! * when it comes to sunblock I want to cringe at the price but it works SO WELL and my skin doesn't break out AT ALL when using this.
I know I'll be rebuying it once I run out. * Again - poorly packaged; leaked all over the very small bottle.  Over priced for the amount. * Don't like this product. If u sweat it will burn and irritate your eyes. * I have several Kiehl's products, I am in love with this brand and have the best skin I've had in a long time. Some things I deal w/ are being acne-prone, oily, rosacea and very sensitive. I've been doing some research on rosacea and have read that wearing a daily SPF can help with redness (among many other benefits, of course). I wanted to make sure I was getting a product from a brand I believe in because face sunscreen has been tricky for me. It's usually greasy and breaks me out significantly. I spent the extra money for this product and am unfortunately not very pleased. Like other comments, this product does ball up on the face. I find that I have to let my daily moisturizer sink in for AT LEAST 10 minutes before I can put on my sunscreen. And the more you try to massage it into the face, the more it will ball up. Other than that, my MAJOR complaint about this product is that after applying and about an hour after it's on my face, my skin starts to burn. It feels as though I have a mild sunburn across my entire face where you can feel the discomfort and burn. Again, I have sensitive skin and apparently it's just not reacting well with me. I've gone a few days without it and then tried it again and it is 100% this sunscreen. I'm out side of my return time so I'm stuck with it and really disappointed. I hate having to purchase products to figure out what works for my skin. Just writing this in-depth review for those of you with the same kind of skin as me...just to think twice. I will say, it does eventually sink into my skin and does not leave it greasy so that's a positive. * Since it is new to me, I am still trying to learn the right amount to apply. Too much (first try) and I had to blot it to make it just right. Second day, it was fine. It does not leave a white cast, definitely a pro. For its high quality, the price is reasonable!"
212,clinique,broad spectrum spf 50 sunscreen body cream,pimprod2037471,2604492," * I have gone on outdoors and swimming. It never disappoints when it's body protection. Against let's say, Neutrogena spray-on SPF, I got sunburned on the areas where I used the latter one, and the Clinique SPF protected areas remained unharmed."
213,australian gold,botanical tinted face sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2012275,2615515," * I liked this, it went on great, flet good, and dried matte which was great for me cause im a oily girly but as a black woman it does leave a heavy white cast, like black makeup in the 90's/ casket ready type of white cast which is a no no for me, and it was obvious if i didnt rub it into my hair line which is why the rating is so low. So unless you like that kind of look I wouldn't suggest it for my brown and black girl, boys, gays or theys. * Such a nice sheer tint, blends easily. definitely get this!!!! * My skin is sensitive and acne-prone so it's oftentimes challenging for me to find an spf that works. I absolutely love this spf tint - it looks natural on my skin, doesn't break me out, and it provides good sun protection. Please bring back all three shades of this! I miss being able to purchase it from here * Im a chemical sunscreen girl, but I kept seeing this sunscreen on social media so I decided go give it a try. 

PROS: 
- whipped texture 
- neutral tones 
- matte finish 
- absorbs oil
- good around the eye area 
- great for oily skin and/or summer
- 50+ SPF
- great for an active lifestyle

CONS: 
- feels a little heavy until it sets 

I do two layers of sunscreen: first a chemical sunscreen and then a mineral sunscreen. This is the best mineral sunscreen I've tried (Neutrogena, Cerave, MDSolarSciences, DMTLGY). * It's REALLY good, just not for someone with dry skin. I do like the texture, coverage, natural looking color, and the overall matte apperance but after 30 minutes it dries me out so bad. It would be good for humid days/someone with ""normal"" skin. * Over all good but very prone to rub off on clothing. Can't use near v neck and don't pull a top over your head. * The title says it all.  I purchased this, very excited to have found a sunscreen that is spf 50 and tinted AND acne safe.  Read some reviews saying it was not good at all, etc, great for oily skin.  This is why I was happily surpised that on my fair, dry skin it felt and looked great.  It was a little bit dark for my skin but it just made me look bronzed there wasn't any harshness or orange.  And it felt good on my skin under makeup (concealer and powder) all day.  Very suprised it also did not transfer.  Overall great product but I am suspicious of how it is spf 50 when the active ingredients do not indicate this at all."
214,dime,wonderscreen broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2035158,2603227," * I am quite disappointed with this product. It is very expensive and I expected more from it. Also reviews from other people somehow made me think this would be some kind of holy grail. I have rosacea and red bumps on my skin. On the very first day I applied this to my face, I noticed that the skin started to flake and become drier than ever, as well as a tingling sensation. Maybe I just can't tolerate the mineral sunscreens, I'm not sure, but I expected more for this price. * Does what is supposed to, but the white cast is insane! Feels super heavy and oily on my dry skin and it peels when appliyng makeup. * It is now 2024 and we still have physical sunscreens that give darker skin women a white cast. The 12 dollar Neutrogena sunscreen will give you the same results. Save your money. * Another physical sunscreen that pictures black women but then isn't inclusive. It still gives whitecast on brown skin. Disappointed. * For me personally I found it to be watery and made my face look pasty white. Just like the kind you would get from normal skinscreen. Granted it does smell good and does the job of protecting my skin. * This spf is so lightweight and easy to wear under makeup. I have very oily skin and for a change a spf lotion didn't make it worse. I can't recommend this enough * The actual sunscreen is great but unusable because of the pump. Have to take off lid and try to fish out little globs of it to actually use. Too bad. How could their quality dept approve this packaging?!"
215,black girl sunscreen,kids spray & play spf 50 sunscreen,pimprod2038242,2609780," * The sunscreen itself isnt bad but it only lasted me two days. * I wanted to love this more. When I sprayed it on my face, the product seeped into my eyes and burned the rest of the night. If I spray it on my hands and apply it that way, I love how it sits on my skin. Nice glow but heavy fragrance."
216,avÃ¨ne,mineral sunscreen broad spectrum spf 50 face and body lotion,pimprod2039988,2611198," * I love this! For a completely mineral sunscreen with no tint, I'm super impressed. This is a great moisturizer and can totally be used as a single step. It does have a waxy sort of smell to it when you first apply but it doesn't linger- if you're someone who has to use all fragrance-free products because of eczema you probably already know exactly whatp I'm talking about. But again, the smell doesn't linger, it completely disappears.

There is also a pretty strong white cast when you first apply, but after rubbing it in well and waiting for it to absorb (you should be waiting ~20 mins after applying sunscreen before you go outside anyway!) it completely disappears on my brown skin. (I'm about the skin tone of Parveen Kaur for reference lol.) I only use it on my body though, for two reasons: 1) I prefer tinted minerals on my face to help with hyperpigmentation, and 2) white casts are always more noticeable on the face in my opinion. But if I try it on my face I will report back!

Overall, I find this super moisturizing and great for winter dryness and/or eczema prone skin. I like to apply it on my arms and legs, even in the winter when I'm covered up. Feels thick and soothing and leaves my skin soft. If you like a lightweight sunscreen that doesn't feel like body lotion, this is NOT for you. Especially in a humid climate, this might be too much. I also can't speak to the white cast for someone with a deeper skintone than mine. But for my skin type (brown, dry and sensitive, lifelong eczema, braving the new england winter😭), I really love this! * I am not one who is harsh on products and always give them the benefit of the doubt, but this one had an overpowering smell! I do not mind a heavy fragrance but this one was not pleasant. I would absolutely purchase again if there was a way to tone down those scents some! I did some reasearch and some people mentioned that it may be a scent from the minerals causing a weird smell rather than adding fragrance which can cause a reaction in some people. Who knows, but I do know I hold my breath everytime I put it on! :( * This has the least amount of whitecast of any mineral sunscreen ive tried and is one of the highest SPFs I have seen. The smell is not pleasent. But it goes away after a bit. I have asked my bf and he cannot smell it on my skin after the inital application. * This sunscreen is too white, has a scent to it its not bad but not for me im sure theres better sunscreens * I had buy this same product but it had a different packaging(it used to be orange) i loved it back then, because it keept my skin hydrated(super good for dry skin). 
This time the smell and consistency of formulation is way different, too liquidy, and i can learn to work with that… but the smell, it's just awful, i thought it was caducated but nope… 
If they could only take that smell away i would love this again! * I'm not sure how they can market it as ""not greasy"" when even after an hour of application it is still quite greasy on the face and body. That being said, it does a great job protecting from burning and tanning, and despite it's greasiness it's held up for many hours in sweltering heat and humidity. I wore a thick layer to the theme park, set it on the face with SPF powder, and throughout the day dabbed the sweat off with face tissue. No burns or tanning. Not an everyday wear SPF but good for when you expect to be out in the heat/sun for a time. * White cast on face :/ This is not for melanin skin at all. Im olive/medium tan, kund of like jessica albas skin tone, im not even that dark and this left a obvious white cast, my face had that purple hue, I looked awful. and the consistency is very thick, goopy and sticky and had this weird smell. I guess this would be fine to use for the body if you are not easily bothered by consistency or smell
. I prefer a sunscreen that feels like its not there"
217,bliss,block star sheer liquid daily sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2038458,2607974," * this formula is now my new favorite.  I love their tube tinted version in spf30, but this one knocks it out of the park.  it is runny, smooth, not greasy, blends well.  it's everything I. looking for in a sunscreen including the 20% zinc! * This is one of my favorite sunscreens, I'm very fair and the white cast really evens out my skin, it looks like I am wearing a tinted moisturizer. If you're super pale and in the market for a tinted moisturizer or sunscreen, I cannot recommend this enough! * I'm actually a fan of other Bliss products, but I have never experienced a whiter cast from sunscreen in my life. I could tell it would have one as it came out of the bottle, but wanted to trust the ""sheer"" claims. Will be returning. * I really like the light weight feel of this sunscreen, espeically for a mineral one. Although I find it pills under makeup and can cling to dry spots. So best for a no makeup day. * Iv tried a lot of sunscreens and I mean alot . Every single sunscreen I have used breaks me out even mineral ones. This sunscreen is by far the best one iv ever used its just amazing . * This sunscreen is so good. I've tried so many sunscreens and this one has everything I want. It actually absorbs, no white cast, it doesn't get into my eyes, and it's recyclable. * I need to stick to mineral sunscreens for my skin, so it's been hard for me to find one that leaves a minimal white cast, has high SPF, and is water-resistant. I just finished my first bottle of this, and so far I think it's one of the better ones I've tried! It doesn't irritate my skin, blends impressively for SPF 50, and doesn't feel heavy at all.

I have tan skin, so I usually wear a BB cream over this to cancel out the slight white cast this leaves. Note that it's a high SPF, untinted *mineral* sunscteen, so I cannot expect it to be fully clear. 

The one downside is that this seems to turn white in areas that get wet or have a lot of friction, such as under the bridge of your glasses. It can be rubbed back in very easily, but that's something to note."
218,mad hippie,luminizing facial spf 29,pimprod2030862,2592480," * I was excited about this susncreen because I use other Mad Hippie products. However, I only used it for a week as I noticed my skin became super dry while I was using this and my pores were so clogged even when I exfoliated. I also started getting little bumps on my face and redness. There was also residue when I applied makeup on top. * I like this SPF a lot. You do need to rub it in quite a bit, but I like the glowy effect and that it has clean ingredients. I definitely recommend! * It's lightweight, not greasy, dries quickly and looks great. I love the ingredients and price :) * Not one to go out of my way to write a bad review but this product caused some kind of allergic reaction. Used it just once and started itching on neck. Spread to a rash everywhere I put product. Still dealing with eczema leather skin type of rash * I like how it feels on the skin but it dries down very quickly which means that you cannot put it on in sections, you have to apply to your whole face at the same time or it will pill on the face which is annoying * it did it's job but will never buy again because it literally smells fishy. * I'm loving this facial spf from Mad Hippie. It comes in an easy to use squeeze tube and is a great size to take on the go. The texture is creamy and lightweight,  and glides so smoothly on my face. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave my combo skin feeling greasy or tacky. It has a light scent that smells so good, not like your typical sunscreen scent, but to me like cucumber melon scent. I absolutely love the way I smells!! It has a pretty shimmer that leaves my face glowing and beautiful.  It doesn't leave any white cast at all and feels amazing on my skin. It's honestly my new favorite spf, and I will definitely be buying more to stock up. I received this product complimentary from Mad Hippie."
219,hempz,sweet pineapple & honey melon herbal body sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2044324,2621607," * Just started using this sunscreen and it's been very good so far. It's lightweight and not greasy and definitely gives u a cute glow. * so far so good. * I tried this sunscreen on a whim since I'm already such a fan of this brand and I'm SO pleased! My husband and I used this for the first time for a full day of walking around the zoo and we only had to reapply twice. No burns/pinkness and no residue. * I am obsessed with this sunscreen to say the absolute least! I honestly use it every day as a body lotion because it gives the most beautiful shine without being greasy. It makes my skin look so healthy. It, of course, also serves its purpose as a sunscreen. Please please PLEASE never discontinue this!!! * I love this stuff. It smells great and it works very well. But as an outdoor concert girlie, I'm begging for a miniature version so I can carry it in a small bag * I love this sunscreen! It's an efficient multitasking body  sunscreen that checks all my boxes. The tropical scent is immediately inviting, with the sweet notes of pineapple and honey melon giving off a refreshing, summery vibe that makes applying sunscreen feel less like a chore and more like a treat. The formula is impressively lightweight for an SPF 50, absorbing quickly into the skin without leaving any greasy residue or white cast. It feels more like a hydrating body lotion than a traditional sunscreen, which is a huge plus. The moisturizing aspect is particularly beneficial, keeping my skin soft and smooth even after hours in the sun. It's not water resistant so it's not ideal for sport activity or if you will be sweating a lot. This is also not a face sunscreen, I would describe it as the perfect daily body lotion sunscreen, which I found out also has anti-aging ingredients like Hemp seed oil and vitamin C. As a Floridian I can use this everyday before heading out and take with you to re apply during the day.

220,sun bum,kids spf 50 clear sunscreen lotion,pimprod2036900,2606181," * I bought it because it was clear & I wanted something to go over my tattoos. So I do like it for that. But the chemical scent is so strong, If even put the product up to my face, my eyes sting and water. It also pills into little balls when your rub it in. I havne't gotten burned when I wear it so it does protect my skin- & I'm finishing the bottle because I don't want to waste it. But I would not buy it again. * Feels and smells like a sanitizer. 
Not comfortable puting this on my littles ones. * This stuff has a very strong alcohol smell and mixed with the banana it's almost too much. That being said, I really like how this applies on wet skin. Will continue to use for reapplication purposes only"

222,dune suncare,the mineral melt broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2039397,2609322," * I bought this sunscreen because I heard it doesn't cause a white cast, it did. It also didn't want to blend into my skin 100%, peeled off away from my face (bare) in flakes. I looked like I had white eraser dust on my face. Same thing for my friend. * I have tried sooo many mineral sunscreens and they end up either having a white cast, feel heavy and gross, look too oily, or dry out my already dry skin. I am allergic to chemical sunscreen so im limited on what I can use. Let me just tell you … this sunscreen is IT. It is so lightweight and feels like i am just putting on a lightweight moisturizer. It absorbs fast and the finish looks ""natural"" and not dewy or shiny. No white cast, rubs in easily, and wears well under makeup. I run outside in the sun for 2 + hrs and never get burnt. Cant say enough good things about this sunscreen. * Look - this pills.  I really was hoping this would be a great, sheer, water resistant, mineral option for the summer.  However, if you use more than a smidge, this pills.  I tried on bare skin, over just a toner, under my full normal morning skin routine and it pills on application.  The texture is nice and not drying, and the cast is minimal, but present,  in comparison to many other mineral sunscreens.  I am aggressively neutral on the smell, its a little sunscreen-y, but it doesnt bother me.. Its neither strong, nor long lasting.  Also, its not a great amount.  I plan to use this up on my hands and ears. * I have mixed feelings about this sunscreen. One the one hand it dries down quickly and isnt sticky which I really appreicate. On the other hand it pills around my chin, neck, and eyebrows…which isnt the worst thing but is a little annoying. I mostly use this sunscreen on days where I need to run out of the house and need something that dries down quickly. * I love this sunscreen! As the name suggests it is very sheer and leaves my skin feeling moisturized without feeling sticky or greasy (a big ask for my oily skin). I will say, it does pill up under makeup if you start immediately after applying, but I give it 10 minutes or so and you should have no problem! * I used to use Biossance squalane mineral sunscreen until people started having reactions and it was pulled off the market. In my search for a comparable sunscreen, I found this one and honestly I think I like it even more! Feels very lightweight and moisturizing and blends in well! I like the glow it gives but I don't think it makes me look oily (I have combo-dry skin).My only wish is if they could make an SPF 50+ version! * I've been trying to convince myself that I really like this sunscreen for the last few weeks and I just don't think this is the product for me. Pills frequently regardless of what products I use underneath it, especially around the edge of my face. Won't end up finishing the bottle."

Its not the same. I used to love this product. 
Now its just ok  - it is sticky. 
Will not but again. * Tried this product bc it was on sale. For a zinc oxide mineral based SPF, this tinted moisturizer feels very light on the face. Not as light as a chemical SPF moisturizer such as a Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, but it's a mineral SPF so it sits as a physical UV barrier like mineral sunscreen does. 

No white cast with this mineral SPF bc it's lightly tinted. I was surprised as others bc it's not apparent on the packaging except for one small info graphic on the side that it's tinted. But I imagine that's how they got around it having a white cast residue. I have extremely light skin with reddish hair and using two pea-sized product amount left no discernible cast once it soaked in over a few minutes. 

The scent is akin to bubblegum or cotton candy but thankfully does not last once it's dried. I really like that it's a light weight mineral tinted moisturizer, but simply based on the overly sweet scent I probably won't buy this product again. I need a mid30s formulation of this product not the teens formulation this product feels like it's geared towards :P * I had no idea it was tinted. Nothing (at least prominent) on the packaging that indicates it's tinted. When I squeezed it out, it's orange. Looks absolutely terrible. Not a glowy tan. Rather the color of a former POTUS. * I didn't like the consistency or tint * I absolutely love pacifica as a brand and honestly i really like this line too, the cleanser is great. But this sunscreen is a no go for me. Its WAYYYYYY too dark, im naturally very pale but ive tried it both on my usual pale tone and tanned and either way its patchy and dark. It feels extremely heavy and gross on the skin and was a sensory nightmare. It dries super fast so its a pain to blend even if it was a closer shade to me. Spend the extra 20$ and get yourself some supergoop. * I love this product so much! I replaced my foundation and now use this for the summer. It makes my face look so healthy and gives it a nice glow. No sun burns either! * One of the worst tinted sunscreen I've tried. Tossed it after using it twice. It would matt down and stayed on looking greasy, not luminating but greasy looking!"

The whole family use it to. * I occasionally use it as a base for my make up and usually the first thing in the morning. If you don't set it with powder, it can get kind of greasy but otherwise it doesn't clog pores or make me break out. * I don't mind greasy sunscreen, but this one stays greasy the WHOLE day. I can't touch my face without having to wash/wipe my hands. It doesn't break me out so I'll finish the tube, but probably won't buy again * This sunscreen feels light on my skin! It has good ingredients and I use it every day. My only con is that it doesnt mix well with makeup. * 10/10 * I used this when I went to OBX for a week and I didn't burn once.

Goes on very smoothly, not shiny, not too thick, does not make my face look white. It blends in very nicely and has even helped reduce the redness on my face. Love it obsessed need more. * couldn't even try this product to see if it was any good because the pump wouldn't dispense any product and it was extremely annoying to try to scoop out the sunscreen with my finger. * This is the one sunscreen that doesn't break me out and it doesn't have a weird smell. I love that it has a pump but only 1 out of the 3 bottles I had gotten had a working pump. The tubing of the pump is too long and kinks up in the container, and I have to scoop it out with my fingers. It sounds like the defective pump is a big issue for many of us. Please fix this Earth Harbor! 

Nerding out-Many sunscreens claim SPF 30- each 1% zinc oxide = 1.6 SPF units. With 18.8% zinc oxide, this is truely SPF 30, protecting against 97% of UVB rays.

I will stay a loyal customer as long as they fix the pump issue 😊 * burns and itches my skin. pump doesn't work. * the sunscreen itself is fine but the pump on mine doesn't work so i have to scoop it out with my finger * Unfortunately, like others have said, I couldn't get the pump to even get any of the product out. I tried multiple times, thinking the product just had to work its way up the pump but, when I opened it, the tube for the pump was so bent around and around that there was no way the product could have made its way up. Additionally, the product is SO thick that I'm not sure how it even could have fit through the tiny tubing. Instead of scooping it all out, I'm planning to return. * Left my face feeling kind of greasy, but the biggest issue is how jacked the bottle is. When I opened it, I couldn't get the pump to work, and removed it to see if I could get it working. The tube leading from the pump into the bottle was bent into a zig-zag, rendering the pump completely useless. Now I have to scoop it out and use the bent tube like a tiny spatula. The moisturizer itself isn't anything special. Not sure I would buy again, especially if they're not cautious during the packing process to make sure the pump will actually work."

It would be great as an SPF for those who have oily skin, as it gives a smooth matte finish. On my dry skin, it sticks to my dry patches and looks terrible. Even over other moisturizers I am not getting a smooth finish. Just beware if you have dry skin! * It is so hard to distribute on the skin and then leaves a horrible cast. The package said over 80% of users agreed it matched their skin tone which I am assuming was tested on people with white skin. Package is very misleading, do not buy. * This balls and pills so badly even when used alone. Gets worse throughout the day. Do not buy. * Need a mineral sunscreen since skin has been sensitized by tret use, i know physical formulas will never be as cosmetically elegant as chemical, this product is the worst i've ever tried. Separates horribly, clumps on my lips and hairline, strong white cast. * I religiously used the original Ultra Calming moisturizer from Aveeno for over 20 years.  That moisturizer was perfect- amazing texture, good pump packaging, and most importantly it was 100% effective at keeping my redness at bay.
This stuff (which is essentially their replacement to that one) is  garbage.  It's tinted (why?), it has a sticky texture which makes it difficult to blend in, and the packaging is cheap.   On top of all that, it actually has made my redness worse.  Oh!  And it has HALF the amount of the product as the Ultra Calming moisturizer- for a higher price.   Corporate greed trickling down to the consumer does not go unnoticed.  Johnson & Johnson majorly dropped the ball with this new ""Calm and Restore"" line. * Aveeno used to make worlds most perfect face moisturizer. When it was discontinued I was distraught. I tried so many products but my skin breaks out to everything. I figured this is the closest thing they had to the moisturizer I loved so much. It's not. IT IS SO STICKY. It feels AWFUL on my face. I always wash my hands after using it. It doesn't spread well because it's so sticky. it feels like it isn't moisturizing at all. It's also tinted?? Why?? Why is it a tan color? It would probably be awful for any dark skin girlies. I'm super pale so it's too tan for me, and when I itch my face, a ton of orange pigment comes off onto my hands. God I'm so disappointed in Aveeno for discontinuing their last calm and restore product. This one is awful…."

never ever buy a different sunscreen ever again. My skin is fairly sensitive and mildly acne prone. This sunscreen has never caused a breakout, a rash, or any other kind of allergic reaction. Looks flawless under makeup and leaves no white cast!! * Having tried dozens of sunscreens this one is by far my favorite and the one i always repurchase! Amazing texture and finish on skin. * This sunscreen doesn't leave a white cast and feels more like a moisturizer. It doesn't have a nasty smell and it's not too overbearing either! I noticed my skin felt way smoother after using as well. I love it and will for sure buy again. * This is my favorite sunscreen. I buy it over and over again. I'm very pale so I can't speak about white cast, but it's not a mineral sunscreen so that shouldn't be a huge problem. It is very hydrating but not oily. It feels like I've just put on a nice moisturizer. It also reapplies very well. It never pills on top of itself. I don't wear foundation so I don't know about wearing it under anything but it does look good under a skin tint or concealer. * Tried this out for a humid, 100 degree full sun TX vacation. It never stung my eyes! It leaves a shine, but is comfortable to wear and less greasy than any others I've tried. Effective, comfortable, I'm sold! * This is great to use in the morning before my run. I have normal/combination skin and I don't even need to wear a moisturizer under this. It gives me a glow, not over the top. Doesn't sting my eyes, even when I sweat.  I also love the oil-free version for everyday use. That version is perfect over moisturizer and will work best for those with oilier skin. Shiseidos newest sunscreens are a big improvement from their previous version, which I already used. * The only sunscreen that EVER worked for me. Doesn't make my skin break out in fact this sunscreen helped my oily skin get under control. It hydrates without being oily! I don't even need moisturizer with this sunscreen. Thank you ulta for carrying this gem!"

Definitely recommend!! * I applied and reapplied as directed, but I still got a sunburn. I thought I was being responsible by upgrading to a more ""grown up"" sunscreen. I was WRONG. I've used cheap Hawaiian tropic 15 SPF sunscreen with bronzer for years, and I never should've cheated with Supergoop. Just as nice weather has arrived, I have sun marks that probably won't go away. Extremely disappointed. I've really been taking care of my skin for the past 5 years or so, and should've just kept using what I know. * I have very sensitive skin and this doesn't itritate it at all. Feels lightweight not sticky. Doesn't have a strong sunscreen smell. Has a bit of a white cast when you first put it on but it's not noticeable once it fully desolves into my skin. I'm a fan!"

It actually feels good on your skin and works like a primer so makeup goes on smooth. Elated I finally found suncreen I actually want to wear! The tube is a little funky but a gentle squeeze as you pump the top and you're good to go. * I've tried pretty much every mineral sunscreen on the market, only to absolutely hate the way it feels and looks on my skin or it burns my sensitive eyes.... BUT this one checks all the boxes!  It doesn't leave a white cast, doesn't feel heavy or burn your eyes and actually feels really nice on the skin, plus leaves a smooth canvas for makeup.  Highly recommend and as long as they continue to make it, I will continue to use this sunscreen product exclusively. * I ordered two tubes (it was on sale!) and the pump on both tubes was defective. I could not get the product out of the tube to try it. I tried many different ways (short of cutting the tube open). I am so disappointed. * The product is fine. The packaging is horrible. No matter how much I pump, nothing comes out. The only way is to get any product is to squeeze the bottle and pump at the same time. * I initally bought this sunscreen because I had a few moles on my face surgically removed, my dermatologist gave me a gel to clear up the scars but it hadn't worked the way I hoped after a few months. My incision sight was still pretty deep and uneven. After only a week of applying this sunscreen both on my face and directly to my scars they faded even more than they previously had with the prescribed gel!!! It works wonders!! Both for general scars and also acne scars or pigmentation. Swear it always clears them up for me overnight. A little goes a long wayyyy. It's also the perfect size for traveling and on the go application. My skin is super soft after too, there are no cons to it. I love it! * Its okay, personally think there is a smell to it and i think its a little strong and i do not like it. It also pills and doesnt feel like my skin really absorbs it. Will finish the bottle but wont repurchase. * I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I bought this several months ago and I gave it a good shot but I can not believe so many people love this.
It's grainy, leaves a horrible white cast even on my very fair skin and just sits on the skin wrong. It doesn't sink in and dries and flakes and leaves white residue all over my clothes and eyebrows and somehow also is horribly greasy all day, and I have no idea why but no matter what I do it spreads and ends up in my eyes after about an hour after applying and it HURTS."
234,shiseido,ultimate sun protector lotion spf 60+,pimprod2045899,2620952," * I've been using thr Shiseido sunscreen for years. The new formula is even better than the original. It smells nice, protects, hydrates and its great for people with eczema. I'm no doctor but my kids and I have horrible eczema and this does not burn our skin like other sunscreens. It also works beautifully that we don't burn as fast. Hands down the only sunscreen we take go the beach. * I love it so much I have been using for years!! I love how it makes my skin glowy. I have dry ans slightly oily skin it does not make my skin just hydrated, You must shake the bottle everytime you use it just a heads up. ( I have seen reviews about ""it's oily or it separates"" you have to shake it common sense) but anyways LOVE LOVE 10/10 * I have been using thos sunscreen for a long time. I love it so much. It makes my skin so glowy. * This is very oily sunscreen, it's almost shimmery. It made my face so greasy. This is sunscreen is fine for body use, but I don't recommend it for your face. * I bought the travel size version of this  lotion two weeks ago to take with me on a trip. I've always heard really good things about this brand, and thought I'd give it a try, but unfortunately it's just not for me. I felt like the texture of this product was sticky even after drying and left my face feeling very greasy. I have rosacea and my skin tends to be very reactive to new products. I was hoping this would be different, but it did make my entire face break out pretty badly. The fragrance is much heavier than I would like from a facial sunscreen. The sun protection factor was great, and I will continue to use the rest of the product on my chest/hands/body. If you have dry skin and don't have sensitivity issues like I do, this probably is a great product. * I absolutely love this product!!! Ive been using it for years and its the only thing that doesnt make me get sun burns. I will say its a bit on the oily side but if you plan on tanning or just laying by the pool i dont see a big deal in looking a bit oily . It blends so well with my skin tone i will be buying again * As always, loveee shisiedo sunscreens. This is just like the original, but hey the more SPF, the better. No white cast, no break outs, and my makeup never pills while using this. I see sometimes people worry about wateriness, but that's only happened to me if my bottle was in my bag on a hot day or I forgot to shake it well before squeezing some out."
235,buttah skin,tinted mineral sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2029216,2590116," * It doesn't create a cast and is a perfect match for my skin but at the price paid, the packaging is terrible. The product comes out at the seam on the side where the label stops. * As a Latina with brown oily skin type  that likes to try new mineral sunscreens for people of color would totally recommend this sunscreen under makeup. Did not have any issues with pilling and wore beautifully under my matte foundations! * This is a very good sunscreen, but I think they need to take it back to the lab and tweak the formula as it flakes and pills by midday. Because of this, you cannot wear it under foundation otherwise you'll have a big mess on your face. I've been using it for about a year now but I'm currently looking for another brand. I will revisit this product in the future if they ever improve the formula.
PROS:
Excellent mineral based SPF
Matches my skin perfectly
No white cast
Dries down into a beautiful dewy finish
POC owned
Great price! * I purchased this item when it first came out, and I was very excited to support a black owned brand and have another option for a mineral sunscreen that wouldn't look crazy on darker skin. It does blend in very well, although it still has a slight light cast as any mineral sunscreen is going to. However, I noticed that it would pill throughout the day. I tend to unconsciously rub my face throughout the day, and I would get little bits of sunscreen on my hands. I tried using other products underneath thinking my vitamin c or my moisturizer was the issue, but no matter what combination it always pilled. * I have dry skin and really wanted to try this out but I didn't know it gave a matte finish so I follow it up with a water resistant sunscreen from black girl sunscreen. * This product leaves no white cast and has a matte finish which is a plus however it pills very easily and flakes off throughout the day. Due to this, I am unable to apply any sort of blush/ highlight/ etc. after application as it will cause the sunscreen to flake off which is clearly not ideal. For reference I have combination skin. * I've tried this several times since I purchased it and no matter what I try, it pills up and flakes all day whether alone or under makeup, with or without my skincare.  After seeing the rave reviews I had really high hopes for this.  The search continues!"
236,shiseido,urban environment oil-free mineral sunscreen spf 42,pimprod2038381,2606930," * I received this as part of my sample pack & finally decided to give it a try at the beach & poolside.

I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't cause my skin to breakout & it really stood up to the sun.  I was able to achieve a nice tan, while wearing sunglasses, but didn't get the raccoon eyes.

I normally wear the tinted sunscreens that are just as expensive, but they actually feel greaser & cause my skin to breakout.  I don't mind the shiny look as long as my face doesn't feel greasy.  In fact, it goes on rather light.

I'm going to try tge vitamin c one next.  But am definitely sold on this one. * This has been my go to sunscreen option for years now.
It's light. 
It doesn't irritate the eyes.
It doesn't have any weird smell that sometimes sunscreen has.

I love adding a super watery cream underneath it, 
cz indeed is a bit dry on the skin. * I've recently discovered that this mineral sun screen pairs perfectly with Bare Minerals makeup! So much better than using a primer! Be sure to wash your face and moisturize prior to applying the sun screen and makeup. It really helps to keep your skin from feeling dry. 

The consistency is very liquidy. It doesnt feel sticky. Although it does leave a white cast when worn alone so I avoid doing so. Instead, I apply the Shiseido stick sun screen when im bare faced. I havent experienced any eye irritations with this."

Try them out !! * Hempz sweet and honey melon herbal sunscreen is great smelling! Went out to the pool in this super hot weather and realized this was the perfect opportunity to test out the sunscreen. The sunscreen is smooth and not tacky when being applied to the skin. It does not leave that nasty white residue that most of other known sunscreens leave. The product smells so good that I am able to utilize it on a daily basis when going out! Highly recommend! * If you love sweet and fruity sents- this is it. It smells like a fruity drink from your favorite pool bar. It has a sheen/glowy finish without glitter! I am a distance runner and it is sweat proof and I have yet to get a sunburn! Overall my favorite sunscreen i have ever used. My only complaint it is does get a tad greasy- I wouldnt say it is terrible, but i dont mind greasy when im running! * This is so lush and smells heavenly. I loved using this before going outside in my walks knowing my skin smelled amazing and was protected 

*this review was collected as part of a promotion* * I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen. Its so moisturizing and it doesn't make me feel sticky after putting a lot of layers on. I also wake up and my skin is still soft from the sunscreen. Definitely going to continue to buy this sunscreen. * This is my first time trying a Hempz product and I am completely in love with it. I have tried a few sunscreens in the past, but I always get turned off by their scent. The Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon sunscreen instantly became a favorite because it smells great and doesn't leave a white cast.

Putting on this sunscreen made me want to travel. I get an instant ""St. Tropez"" feeling. I would describe the scent as walking down the beach because it made me reminisce about a time when I lived in a beach town. It made me also want to take a walk down the beach while holding hands with a lover. 

I honestly did not notice the smell of the hemp oil, which means the brand did a great job masking it with the pineapple and melon.I was not the only one who fell in love with it. My sister who is a lifeguard has been on the hunt for a high-quality sunscreen. She snatched this from me the moment she tried it.

We both agreed that it won the ""Best Smelling Sunscreen"" award. The best part about this sunscreen is that it's very moisturizing. It felt as if I was putting on lotion instead of sunscreen. 

I believe this product is great for the gourmand girlies. I would recommend keeping this in your purse and using it as hand lotion. I'm pretty sure our hands need sunscreen anyway!"
238,derma e,vitamin c broad spectrum spf 45 weightless moisturizer,pimprod2017307,2569861," * Have loved this product and used it for several years.
The last two bottles I have purchased from Ulta are not the same consistency as the product  I have purchased in another store.  Had to throw both away..  i * shocked this has mixed reviews. ive repurshed over 10x its my faborite moisturizer ever and i tried a lot... smooth skin minimizes pores and keeps me acne free !!!!!! * Was hopeful this item would be a good moisturizer but it is too thick and even after trying to rub it in for many minutes left my face with white residue.  Had to return. * Its so hard fo find a good sunscreen so im not surprised by this one. Although the product is not at all thick, it is very hard to rub in and yoh need to use a lot of product to cover your entire face/neck. The scent also burns my eyes and nose * I'm confused about white cast everyone speaks of, as long as you shake bottle & rub it in, then you should be fine; atleast my olive medium skintone is. Effective vitamin C & fab primer. I actually use a lil extra to create cast if wearing makeup. * I've had a good experience with this product. Initially, it does go on whiteish, but to me that indicates the quality of the SPF, which is why I bought it. Once applied, I feel it performs well; I don't feel too dry or too oily. * Leaves a white cast, pools in creases as you sweat, and it made my skin dry and textured. Just…no."
239,strivectin,anti-wrinkle glowfector spf 30,pimprod2036307,2603503," * I like this SPF. BUT it needs to be 2.5 time the amount for the price. Following the directions I apply generously to face and neck, but didn't re-apply every 2 hours--just once more in the middle of the day on no makeup days. The tube lasted less than 2 weeks using it this way. WAY too spendy * I received this product as a sample initially, and I will say that I hesitated to try it because I usually only use products labeled ""clean"" and ""cruelty-free"" and this is neither of those. Additionally, this moisturizer has a slight fragrance which would usually disqualify it from my regimen but I got hooked on the scent and the effect. I had 2 small wrinkles between my eyebrows and after using this, they're gone. I use this over my serums and facial creams and I'll buy this again and again. * I love the moisturizing, glowy feeling of the product with SPF! Perfect for daily use. * I don't ever leave reviews bit hos product is amazing! I have worked for dermatology offices for years and have been fortunate to try many different sunscreen products but this one may be my favorite ever! It's not sticky, goes on smooth and leaves a beautiful glow and looks so natural! * This product goes on very heavy and greasy so I was already nervous.  I headed out on a hike and six miles in, it started melting and oozing into my eyes.  There was nothing I could do at that point. Worst sunscreen ever. Buy Goop Unseen Sunscreen. * Best SPF ever. I love the glowy finish and it even works under my makeup. * I tried this in store while shopping and immediately fell in love, I've been using it for 2 weeks now. The glow that it gives my skin is beautiful, it also does not leave a white cast nor feels like a traditional SPF. I even tried it under makeup and it made everything look dewier and smoother. I highly recommend!"
240,sun bum,mineral lotion spf 30,pimprod2021610,2575600," * I love Sun Bum products and really wanted to love this. I was looking for a high SPF mineral formula without too much of a white cast. This was OK on first application - a little thick though so you need to work it in; then as you reapply, it turns into glue. Takes a lot to get it off of your body in the shower. However, no sunburns with multiple applications. No skin irritation. * It's not terrible, but I do not like it remotely, HALF as much as I like the Ulta brand one. I'm new to mineral sunscreens and I bought 2 from Sun Bum and 1 from Ulta. Both of the Sun Bum mineral sunscreens (SPF 30 and 50) are chunky and ridiculously harder to spread on the body. I felt like I was spreading toothpaste, or bondo on my legs and arms. I couldn't imagine trying to put it on my face. The Ulta brand is a sheer delight to put on in comparison. I felt like I COULDN'T rub it in and get past the white cast, and I am so pale I could blend in with a cloud. After seeing how hard it was on my legs (30SPF) and arms (50SPF), I didn't DARE use it on my face and I used the Ulta instead. 50SPF was the intended sunscreen for the face, but that wasn't happening with how delicate my face is from acne right now. Yeesh. I'll use the Sun Bums, and my husband will, but I definitely wouldn't repurchase it. Makes me reconsider the entire line from this brand after both tubes were so much chunkier in consistency and THICCER than your girls thighs versus Ulta's. * This is thick upon applying it, but after about 10 minutes it settles. I love this for my sensitive, allergy-prone skin. It is also chemical free which is great for sensitive skin! My favorite part is the no white cast. I don't know how they managed to do it without tinting it, but this is POC friendly. Also doesn't pill like most physical sunscreens do. * I purchased to use as a moisturizer sunscreen per recommendation of store associate to protect hyperpigmentation. This product is very thick and sticky. It burns my skin also. Not a good purchase. * I used the spf 50 version of this formula, but sadly it was too heavy for me and caused breakouts. This formula seems much lighter, the white cast is not bad, and the feel is good! Still a bit on the heavier side of sunscreens for me, which is why this is going to be my go-to winter sunscreen. I won't bother to look for another, this one does it the best! * A little background on my skin: I'm a redhead and have very fair/ pale skin (alabaster foundation) which is moderately sensitive and burns easily (and won't ever tan, it just peels and burns again). This sunscreen uses fragrance, but doesn't irritate my skin. It feels lightweight and not greasy. The formula is thin enough to easily apply and rub in quickly (much better than the Cotz mineral sunscreen for face and body, non tinted). It smells like coconut, which I love, and doesn't leave a cast or sticky grease layer on my skin.
If you have a deeper complexion than me and are concerned about a cast, I couldn't say for sure but I think this stuff is worth a try since it's so thin and rubs in so well. If you have very sensitive skin, just tread carefully as the scent is very strong. Definitely worth a try, but keep the receipt just in case it doesn't work for you. Hope this helps! * The only downside is that this uses fragrance. Thankfully, my skin isn't extremely sensitive so this is okay for me, but if you have very sensitive skin or are allergic to coconut I would tread carefully if you try this. If you don't have sensitive skin, it smells so nice and absorbs quickly without leaving a cast. However, I have very pale skin (I usually use Alabaster foundation with cool undertone) and don't know if this will leave a cast if you have a deeper complexion. It's thin enough that it's probably worth a try though, since you can rub it in so well. Hope this is helpful!"
241,cotz,mineral sun stick spf 45,pimprod2036814,2606141," * Very frustrated that Cotz advertises itself as healthy and ecoconcious when non of its products are. This Product received a poor raring on Yuka App. Product contains many harmful ingredients including dimethicone  which harms the environment and ends up in the blood of fish, birds and mammals building up in the environment without ever breaking down. Cotz advertising is an example of brand green washing at its finest. * This is good for touch ups when you're on the go. Despite being a stick format, it has a mousse like texture. I like that it can fit in a pocketbook (the cylinder shape makes it awkward for a pants pocket). This does feel heavy on my skin (normal/balanced type) and has a sticky/tacky feel after application. This also left a whitecast on my skin (Fitzpatrick type 2, fair Asian Skin, wear clinque foundation in shade bone; I swiped at least 4x per section of my face to have adequatecl coverage). The finish is definitely on the shiny side, especially for me. My preference is for matte or skinlike finish, so this was too shiny for me, but someone who likes a glowy finish may like this. I would recommend this for someone with fair skin on the dry side (or balanced/normal in a dry climate) and doesn't mind a shinier/""glowy"" finish."
242,ulta beauty collection,mineral sunscreen lotion spf 50,pimprod2003870,2536168," * I like how its not greasy and it dries matte but the white cast is so terrible. Im medium tan skin tone so i end up looking like a clown. Seriously its like white face paint on me and its hard to blend after it dries. Couldnt put foundation on too because it ended up pilling and made me look like i had patches * I use this daily on my face, neck, chest, and hands, alone or as a primer. I do rub it in well and have learned to avoid my eyelids, but around my eyes is fine. If you have oily skin, this one may not stay put. I have combination skin, fair and pink and prone to sunburn. It is one of the only mineral sunscreens that I will put on my face because I'm prone to breakouts. It's this or Cotz. Since Cotz is a tiny tube for the money, I got this to travel with and not need a separate body sunscreen. I've never gone back!

On your body, be sure to rub it in well. If you don't, it will transfer to your clothes. * It leaves a horrible white cast, and melts off when I sweat. It's really thick, and no matter how little I use, or how much I blend, I can't make it work. * It leaves a horrible white cast, and melts off when I sweat. It's really thick, and no matter how little I use, or how much I blend, I can't make it work. * I've been using this daily for about 2 weeks and love it.  I don't have any issues with a white cast so I'm not sure if other reviewers who have are using it correctly. I have dark olive skin and it looks fine on me. Just rub it in good.  It doesn't get greasy at all. I'm very pleased and will buy again. * Number 1, you need to use 1/4 tsp on your face and neck to get the spf protection on the label, for any brand. But the awful white cast just made me use less. Using the proper amount would make me look like a ghost. In fact, it actually did in a group photo a friend posted. When I saw it I was like OH NO. And I even had foundation over it. Also nice that you can't even read the new packaging. I'll use this up on my feet or arms I guess. * The scent is super strong and leaves a white cast."
243,supergoop!,zincscreen 100% mineral lotion spf 40,pimprod2042924,2621275," * I've been using this sunscreen consistently for about a year and I love it.  It's lightweight, blends easily, and works well under makeup. * This is my favorite sunscreen and always need it in my skincare routine! I love the glow it gives me. It works perfectly under my makeup! * The second ingredient is Tetradecane which is toxic and known to cause cancerous tumors in mice. Deceitful marketing by saying it has ""clean"" ingredients. * I understand the 1 Star review, and it depends on the user and when the product is used.  I live in TX, and it is hot, hot, hot and humid so need something for my mornings in the garden with hat, etc.  Also, on a beach or for walking as eyeliner is my only real necessity going out the door for these activities.  I vary between a liquid foundation and a powder and am using the Mineral Matte Screen SPF 40. Matte products work best for me here. * This sunscreen is oily and made mg face look like a greased skillet. I waited ten minutes and then put on liquid foundation, and it was a slippery mess. Brush strokes all over my face. 
I cant say one nice thing about this product."
244,avÃ¨ne,hydrance+ moisturizing sunscreen lotion spf 30,pimprod2043842,2620352," * I really wanted to love this product because it is clean and highly rated on Yuka. However, it doesnt sink into the skin and I ended up with little white pilling all over my face. I tried using after thoroughly hydrsting my skin and still the same issue. Would not recommend * Oil-free but feels slimy and has a weird smell.  I have combo skin so it feels really greasy.  Glad I got it on sale and won't repurchase. * Might work on super dry skin, but not for my normal (sometimes normal/oily combo) skin.   Makeup is sliding off after 30 minutes.  Glad I purchased while on sale because not worth the full price.  Will keep to use on hands and neck since it does not smell and still need sunscreen protection. * I live by Avene products and wanted to love this so badly. Maybe I got a bad batch, but there is a lingering smell to this that I just cant get past. * As someone who has tried dozens of sunscreens, this one is elite in my opinion. The skincare in it makes my skin so glowy and hydrating and I love how dewy my skin looks when wearing. It wears well under make up, but you do have to rub it in well to prevent the white cast and so that the product absorbs in fully. It does feel a little bit sticky and a little heavy, but I don't necessarily mind that. Overall it feels more like skincare than sunscreen in my opinion and I will definitely repurchase."
245,proactiv,clear skin spf 30 face sunscreen,pimprod2033282,2595005," * Gosh I wanted to love this so bad! It's lightweight, non-greasy, and gives my skin a nice glow. However, every time I use it, by the next day, there's zits that pop up. This is the only new product I've introduced. I believe it's the tocopheryl. :( * Very irritating * I need to wear sunscreen daily because of my acne products, but I've yet to find one that doesn't clog my pores even further. Seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I bought this when it was on sale. Sadly, it doesn't live up to the hype. It was lightweight on my skin, but it smells like cheap body sunblock. And every time I used it I had a new zit forming by the end of the day, without changing anything else in my skin routine. I wanted this to work so badly, but it does the opposite of being good for acne prone skin. * I was going to give 4 stars because it has a Proactiv scent I'm not in love with, However 5 stars because it does a great job as an spf as well as clearing up your face at the same time. * Since I am using retinol, my dermatologist insists that I wear sunscreen.  I have struggled to find any spf sunscreen that my reactive sensitive oily acne-prone mature skin doesn't breakout to and react to.

This is my first facial sunscreen success.  This one is great!  Doesn't leave me greasy or overly shiny.  Doesn't irritate or break out my skin.  I only wish it was higher spf, but better spf 30 than nothing. * I have very oily skin and hate wearing SPF. I have trial and errored so many mositurizers and this is the best one. Doesn't feel greasy or heavy on my skin. Actually has cut down on me looking greasy throughout the day. Highly recommend! * I have purchased this sunscreen many times. It is the best sunscreen to use under makeup. It isn't greasy, doesn't pill and it doesn't break me out."
246,beautystat cosmetics,universal c skin refiner 20% vitamin c serum + spf 50 mineral sunscreen,pimprod2037772,2604198," * I have been using the vit c serum without spf and loved it. This one feels very gritty going on takes a good while to absorb and dry down and it pilled as well. Does feel better after applying the moisturizer as recommended. Face now feels soft and not oily or greasy. Not sure if I will continue to use as my spf after this is finished, also small amount and expensive to use every day. * It is a more than wonderful serum for oily skin. It makes the skin clear, fresh, hydrated and free of blemishes. Youthful, attractive and vibrant. It makes the skin like the skin of children. It is like magic for the skin. * I lobe beautystat all products. vitamin C serum looks amazing would love to try. * I love the texture of this product so much & what it does for my skin. * This is one of my faves from beautystat! This has vitamin c in it as well as sunscreen! I love this two in one daily serum, not only does it protect me from the daily harmful rays but it also helps brighten my skin as it's preventing & eliminating my dark spots, wrinkles, and fine lines! I've only tried this for a few weeks and I can already see the difference and smoothness in my face and my neck! You should give it a try, followed by their amazing moisturizer! * Very good serum and it's a good price. I highly recommend it. I will continue to buy it. It brightens up my skin. * This has a gritty texture and leaves a little bit of a white cast. But thats expected from a mineral SPF and a small price to pay for a good formula. I feel good about using this as my daily protection because it gives my skin the brightening benefits of vitamin c.  Ill repurchase this. Its worth the money."
247,peter thomas roth,max vitamin d-fense sunscreen serum broad spectrum spf 50,pimprod2037937,2606105," * super soft and light weight makes my skin glow i have a mixed skin type so im not really oily but this is the second bottle im going to get!!! (: literally love it and recommend if you want sunscreen thats light and watery and makes your skin glow < 3 * Skin is glowing and protected * I recently switched from Cerave am spf30 which left my skin feeling dry and would have to combine with cocoa butter. I've been using this product for about 2 weeks. I have eczema and this leaves my face feeling moisturized for the entire day. No white cast, lightweight but offered full coverage. A little goes a long way. It's good but expensive which is my reason for the 4 stars. My face feels more hydrated and softer. * I've been trying this sunscreen for almost a week now. It applies nicely on the skin at first but my face looks greasy. Do not put this sunscreen near your eyes it made mine irritated and gave a stinging feeling throughout the day. It has the typical sunscreen smell but it is not too heavy. Small breakouts. Save your money from this product it is not all that."
248,peter thomas roth,max matte shine control sunscreen broad spectrum spf 45,pimprod2023948,2579754," * This product isnt matte at all * I like the no shine look * One of the best mattifying sunscreens I've tried! Its perfect for my very oily skin and actually keeps me matte most of the day! I'm not in a very humid climate though. It works very well as a primer underneath a tinted moisturizer I use as well. * Sits on skin. Doesn't sink in. Stays white and wipes right off. * Nice sunscreen! Dries matte. Don't rub it in too much, it will roll off on your skin. * I love the way it absorbs into my oily skin and gives me a matt finish. It's not greasy and it's not fragrant. It is wonderful for in the hot Alabama sun and damp winter. * I have combo skin that in summer humidity is extremely oily and acne prone. This product is the absolute best product I have ever used to control shine, including regular non SPF moisturizers. Normally, I have to blot my face a dozen times a day, no exaggeration, and with this I don't have to blot at all! Life changing! It works amazing under makeup and the sun protection lasts all day. This does not dry the skin and I used it alone without another moisturizer. I use this even when not going outside just for the matte finish. It does not cause acne either. LOVE it. I read another review that mentioned pilling, I did not experience this."

250,supergoop!,play 100% mineral lotion spf 50 with green algae,pimprod2037485,2606309," * I bought this product since I heard good reviews about it. It left a white cast and it was very dry as well. * I ran put of sunscreen sooner than expected. The hotel was selling this sunscreen. I was a bit hesitant because I break out easily, but had to purchase since we were staying on a beach with intense sun. I wore this for 3 days, reapplied every few hours, and I did not get a single sunburn. Surprisingly, I also did not break out. There is a slight white cast, which I don't mind as it makes my skin look a bit glowy. I definitely would repurchase this sunscreen. * So, i guess mineral sunscreens just arent meant for me. I tried a bit on my hand in the store and was hopeful because it didnt leave a shiny grease spot on me, and i didnt notice the white pallor it left (dang tricky store lighting) but with the first face application, i could see i made a mistake. I am VERY fair to begin with and now i look like Casper with this lotion! Add to it the slight sting it causes and dry flaky skin the next day and this is just ALL bad. Only reason i gave 2 stars is because of the non-greasyness * I wanted to try something new for once. I put it on, it felt fine and looked fine. the next day I woke up and my face was flaky, red, and burning. I couldn't go anywhere for a few days not even to work! * I bought this sunscreen becuase i have heard good things about Supergoop! and becuase this is a mineral based sunscreen. I already knew that the zinc oxide in this gives a white cast, but I was not prepared how hard I had to rub my skin to get this slighlty blended into my skin. Would not purchase again * When I first tried it on my hand, I felt it rubbed in we'll so I was hopeful because it's so hard to find sunscreen for brown skin tones. But after using it fully on my face and arms, it started to pill when I had moisturizer, cream, or eczema ointment underneath. It was kind of like it turned to hard paste when trying to rub into skin because the consistency changed. It was pilling on my arms more because I put moisturizer beforehand. I put it on my face without moisturizer underneath and had a white cast for at least 4 hours until the natural oils on my face came in and flushed it out a bit. It's not for darker complexions. It has a chalky sunscreen smell. It's very pricey for sunscreen and I expected better. * I read a review on here that said this sunscreen leaves a white cast and I 100% attest to that. It's a pretty strong white cast that might work for a day at the beach but not for regular use. Hopefully Supergoop! can make a mineral sunscreen for darker complexions but for now I'll continue using their Play: Everyday Lotion SPF 30."
251,mario badescu,mineral sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2032183,2594658," * It is mineral, is not greasy, doesn´t leave a white cast BUT I preffer something more liquid, more light.
And it expensive considering the content. * this sunscreen is great. at first i was not a fan but as continued to use it i found that the pros outweighed the cons. what i love about it is that one pump goes a long way and it spreads nicely. i also love that it doesnt leave a white cast. i apply this on my facial hair and it dries clear. its pretty insane. i was gagged when it dried clear on my BEARED! i was sold after that. it also leaves the skin tacky and glowy, which i love. the only con is that its watery but i noticed that it allows the sunscreen to spread and glide across the skin nicley. like i said, a little goes a long way. i think for people with facial hair, its hard to reach the skin underneath, so i do use more than the avergave person. its a decent amount of product for the price but for people who need to use more, it can be just enough for like a month. nonethless, she did what needed to be done. * I usually don't write reviews but I had such a terrible experience with this product that I felt it was only fair to share my results because my skin looked the worst that it has ever looked in my life!!

I had been using Mario Badescu's Hydro Moisturizer w/ Vit C and my skin was looking great with no breakouts.  Unfortunately, that moisturizer doesn't have SPF in it so I decided to try this sunscreen.  My skin isn't sensitive, but it could not handle this sunscreen. I experienced terrible breakouts around my jawline (which has never happened before) and it took a long time for my skin to clear.

I am a fan of Mario B's products, just not this one… * This is the most misunderstood sunscreen. It is so beautiful and lightweight. The glow is so  amazing! It wears beautifully under makeup too! * has a white cast… * I am always looking for a good mineral sunscreen. The ladies at Ulta recommended this one -and they were right! 
Lightweight, blends easily, slight white cast when first applied (I expect that with a mineral formula) but after waiting the requisite 15 minutes-it has disappeared into my skin. 
Good price point too * I've finally found a sunscreen that works for me. Mineral sunscreen tends to leave a white cast, but I did not have that with this one. I can layer it on top of my serums and moisturizer with no pilling, and it extremely lightweight compared to what I've used in the past. I generally hate using sunscreen, too, but this one is so easy to use that I can see myself using it all year long (as we should be protecting our skin, even in the winter months). I'm also prone to acne and cysts, and I have yet to have a problem and I've been using this stuff since May."
252,undefined beauty,r&r sun elixir spf 30 glow oil,pimprod2045033,2626500," * Pretty lightweight, hydrating and gives a subtle glow,feels nice on skin ,my combination skin looooovessss itt. * I'm absolutely in love with this product! It gives a beautiful glow without feeling greasy at all. I've been using it on my face, neck, and even in my hair—it works wonders everywhere! Plus, I'm so excited to support a fantastic Black-owned brand. It truly feels great to celebrate diversity while enjoying such an amazing product! * this is the only face oil I will use on my skin, it doesn't break me out and locks in hydration!! I also use it for my lymphatic drainage gua sha routine! * I have dry skin, especially during the winter, and this is one of my favorite sunscreens. I can get my sun protection while also getting some good moisture back into my face and body. I love that you can also put it on your hair and scalp. The scent is nice too. * I love this product because its pretty lightweight and i dont really like using a cream so i don't really use spf but now i do. * I love this oil for my dry skin, it doesn't break me out or make me feel greasy. it's lightweight but still moisturizing and it smells good as well. Now that it's getting colder out I really need the extra hydration and this helps a ton. The packaging is also gorgeous and looks so cute on my vanity! * Extremely satisfying to gave a nice glow without the sticky or greasy feeling. It melts into my skin like butter. Unfortunately the squeeze cap broje so i have to leave it on the counter to avoid soilling - easy way for me to remember to use it every chance i get! Eill forever buy this product!"
253,undefined beauty,r&r sun crÃ¨me spf 50 moisturizer,pimprod2040636,2615857," * Oook. The product itself felt nice on my skin once finally blended but omgg the smell is atrocious. I saw one other review that mentioned it, but it literally smells like an iron pill (iykyk). Its NOT GOOD. It does go away after a while like once its been soaked in. I tried to overlook it, but its a no from me personally * Love this SPF it has a bit of a white cast but that goes away super fast it absorbs really well and I use my skin feeling good and not too oily * This is the 3 time that I've purchased this product. I am so in love. * I really like this sunscreen tint.  Make sure you shake it up before applying.  It goes on smooth, no cast. * One of my top sunscreens! Blends in so well!! * This products feels super good on my skin. It is very moisturizing! * I would recommend 100%"
254,pacifica,kind tint spf 30 tinted serum - broad spectrum mineral sunscreen,pimprod2037577,2604656," * I've been able to replace foundation with this product. It gives me a perfect light finish over my face, that being said i have pretty fair skin. I love how i can still see my freckles through it. I really like the way it smells too. It doesnt rub off when i apply my eye makeup, or if i scratch my face, and it doesnt pill up. It doesnt come out of the pump though, i just scoop it out apply it with my hands. I was stressed that pacifica discontinued all their foundations, so i tried this and im so happy i did because it works for me even better than their foundation. I will also add that i have acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. I hope they never stop making this product because its perfect for me. * I bought this looking for an SPF that would help even my skin tone, protect me from the sun, and hydrate my skin. 
This product feels like you're rubbing chalk on your face. It is super thick and hard to spread around your face, so you can't even blend it in. 
Forget about layering makeup on top of it, even by itself it leaves you with a cakey look. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product. I won't even be finishing what I have left of it. * This product feels like rubbing clay on your face, super drying and difficult to blend even on fair skin would not recommend * Goes on smoothly and has a slight scent to it. I don't notice any color tho. So nice for a sunscreen that sinks into your skin but my skin looks no different in tone after putting it on. * This is super lightweight, moisturizing, and easy to blend. It doesn't have a noticeable tint once its applied, and the spf level is great for everyday use but not prolonged sun exposure. A lot of reviews mention whitecast or pilling- I haven't had issues with either. I am very pale though. I only use it with other pacifica products, which might help prevent pilling. It's nice but I'll probably opt for the spf30 lotion once I run out. * apples like chalk * Actyally the worst sunscreen ever :( HORRIBLE white cast and pilled an insane amount. I waited for all of my products to absorb before putting this on and it still pilled like crazy and left an AWFUL white cast"

I have had some sunscreens that are too oily and make me shiny or break out and it doesn't do that. But it has a white cast and peels. Not good under makeup either. Overall pass. * At first i loved it except the strong fragrance. After a week of use its leaving ny skin burning. I hope i can return. I really wantes to be able to use this because i do like the consistency and how quickly it absorbs. * I love the clean ingredients, it leaves no white cast, feels light on the skin, and doesn't make my makeup pill! Seriously my ride or die."
