It's a nice lotion that applies easy. Give it several minutes to dry down before you continue with your make up routine. It has nice broad spectrum protection. Now as I like some glow products because they add a little illumination from within Under your make up, this one was pretty glowy. I didn't need highlighter. In fact, I needed a little bit of modifying powder to tone it down a bit in areas. I didn't want that much glow. If you want to make your matte finish blush have a little more luminosity, this will give a nice base for that effect. * ive tecently started this and it is now my fvsorite prinerr is not inly primes but makes your skin glow * The fact that this has UVA and UVB protection is so huge. I wear this hiking, paddle boarding, at work, etc. and never get burnt. This sunscreen does leave a nice dew, however, you do need to caution against using too much product bc then you might look a lottle greasy and may get a little pilling. Unless they substantially change the formula, this will be a product i always make sure I have plenty of. * I have been using this for years! I love the moisture and glow it gives. * Maybe ok for oily skin but this makes my dry skin SO dry and tight. Yuck. * I have tried many face sunscreens. A lot of them would burn my sensitive skin and make my eyes water, make my skin red, or leave a white cast. This stuff does none of those things! It doesnt even feel like Im wearing sunscreen, nor does it smell like sunscreen! It gives a beautiful, radiant glow to your skin. I get compliments all the time saying ""wow your skin looks so good!"" and ""you have such a glow!"" I used to be self conscious of my uneven, reddish skin tone and would only feel confident if I was wearing foundation or BB cream. Now i have ditched those products, and feel completely confident wearing only this product out because it gives such a radiant glow (its not sparkly, either). I have almost finished the jumbo bottle and plan to buy another one when all Tula products go on sale for 25% off on Sunday, which helps because it's pricey. Highly recommend! * I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen! I first purchased it two years ago and its now a staple in my skincare routine. I used to have dry skin and now have a bit more oily skin as my skin has changed a bit and it still works wonderfully. It leaves the most beautiful glow to your skin 💛"

Not badly but still, i was applying a generous amount throughout the day and get very red. No thanks. Returned. Ill stick to my Coola sunscreen.

Every hour * I usually have fairly clear skin, but this clogged my pores, especially on my nose and T zone. I would not recommend if you have sensitive skin. * It goes on clear and feels so weightless on my face. * Overall,  this product is a great primer. * Hello, will this work for me if I have sensitive skin?? * I really wanted to love this product since it doesn't leave a white cast and isn't oily. However, it kept making me breakout. I was hoping my skin was just purging, but it only got worse. * i have a sensitive nose, so that might be part of it. but i swear i can smell this stuff all day. it also really burns my eyes, so i have to be very careful to keep it far far away from my eyes! i actually like some of my traditional white sunscreens much better than this clear one):"

My sister tried it out as well and it did as well for her. * I first bought this sunscreen in stores and overrall, fell in love with it! Worked for daily use and didnt leave a white cast however I first bought it when I wasnt training in high uv and heat so it worked until uv rays started increasing so now the uv went through the sunscreen and now i am sun burnt 😛🥲 * I love love love this. I suffer from melasma and hyperpigmentation, this has slowly started to reverse all of that. I used to use the spf60 and bought this since i forgot mynsumscreen on a trip. Never going back to anythjng else. * Good sunscreen with 70 spf. I would buy this sunscreen again. * I have to use another sunscreen under this to get near my eyes and mouth. If I get anywhere near my eyes it somehow will work it's way into them. I keep it because it's a high SPF, doesn't look awful on the skin, absorbs well, and has a nice texture. 
But boy does it sting. I try to only put it up near my hairline on my forehead and slightly below my cheeks bones to keep it away from my eyes. Then I thoroughly wash my hands just in case. 
I also keep it away from my lips at all costs because it's got a lingering taste * Even if I don't rub the moisturizer around my eyes it still stings!! It doesn't soak into the skin and as the day goes rhe product starts to melt into my eyes and lips. It tastes soooo bad."

Blends in pretty good * love it * I absolutely love this sunscreen! It's not sunblock, it's sunscreen… not the same thing…. I love the way this feels! It absorbs nicely, and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized, not greasing and slimy like a lot of other sunscreens, which is nice if you have a weird thing about what you put on your body. With that being said, this is a BODY sunscreen. Most sunscreens say they can be used on the face, but there are sunscreens that are designed specifically for application of the FACE. If you purchased this for your face after seeing it on social media and it didn't work the way you wanted it to, that's a you problem. This is the BEST BODY sunscreen I think I've ever used, as I have a sunscreen specifically formulated for my face. And it smells amazing, to boot! It smells the way your skin smells after being at the pool all day, its beachy and mildly coconutty but in an all day pool day kind of way. Imagine you're at a pool at your favorite resort, its hot and sunny and you've been applying sunscreen and drinking pina coladas. Its they way you skin would smell after a day like that! I loved it so much, I bought the perfume too. Oh yeah, and its sun protection is awesome! I was in the sun all day at 8000+ elevation and didn't burn at all. * although it makes my skin super glowy, the scent is super strong for me and burns my eyes. i applied it two hours ago and my eyes are still watering and burning. not to mention i can still smell the sunscreen and gives me the WORST headache. i like the concept of it, but please make an unscented version * This is a very pleasant product. They should make a jumbo size can and a can with spf 50. * Sunscreen is relatively hard to shop for when you are certain skintones because it can give your skin a grey cast. I was skeptical to try this but gave it a shot anyway and I'm glad I did! It smells like coconut cream and blends into the skin beautifully. I am still getting used to gauging how much is just enough rather than too much but overall this is great. I have yet to try it under makeup but wearing it alone gives my skin a healthy glow. I love it! * I love that the fragrance isnt too strong, and i love that it doesnt leave me feeling greasy and does not leave a white cast on my skin. 
I have tried this on my face but my face became a little irritated and i think because of the fragrance, but i also have sensitive skin. For me this product works better on my body than my face."

It leaves at best a lil sheen which is more oily than anything but any glittery sparkly affect is non existent. It's just overpriced spray sunscreen * I love the application, its a good mist and i looove the goow and smell. My obly con us that it finishes so quickly * this product is a dream. it sprays on smoothly, and no need to rub in unless you want to. gives shine but not oily. subtle fragrance, and layerable with other fragrances. this part is hard to describe, so it's moisturizing, like your skin will feel good, but not like a body oil/butter feeling because it absorbs well and doesn't sit on the skin.  overall I'm buying it again, so it's a win. * I loved this sunscreen. I used it on my sensitive skin, my son used it because I sprayed it on him as well. The SPF did it's job. Perfect for the beach because every so many hours you can keep spraying it. Yes, a bit pricy, but worth the hype. * I was excited to try this product but it did not do justice for me. I am a tanned girl and the shimmer was just too subtle for my skin tone. I felt like the shimmer disappeared after an hour. I hope to have better luck with other Kopari products * So many have said their pump broke or they got burned anyway. Mine works great. I LOVE this stuff! I dont burn, its beautiful on, its not terribly greasy and spraying it on is so convenient. It is pricey and ive gone through the bottle fast but i will for sure re-purchase! * Im really suprised at all the people who said it didnt work for them. I couldnt BELIEVE how well it blocked rays for me. In fact, I rinsed one arm because i was rinsing my eyes, went back out later and used drugstore sunscreen and that arm is the only one that did get burned. I loved the shimmer, the oily finish and didnt get a bit burned—used it on the beach in the middle of the day in the sun. I was pleasantly suprised. All that aside, I did downvote it 1 stat because its expensive and even though the bottle looks tall, its mostly the continuous sprayer lid and one use depleted quite a bit of it which is insane for the price."

I have very dry skin and this keeps me so glowy and just makes my skin look so healthy. I can definitely see it in my skin when I'm not using it. It has improved the look of my skin over time as well it's always so soft and it helps to calm down my redness. BUY THIS !!! * I love all other supergoop products, however this one smelt like mosquito spray to me & left me very oily. I will be returning this item unfortunately. * I was surprised at how incredible it makes my skin look. On top of providing protection. During heat waves (like right now) it does make my skin look oily and bloated — so i use another brand instead * My family has been using this for over a year and it works really well * Hands down the BEST SPF product for us chocolate girlies with no crazy white or purple streaks after application. Its an absolute must have for summer. * This product is super duper amazing. I'm  fair skinned and use sunscreen regularly, but begrudgingly....up until now.  This stuff is wonderful! As noted, there's no white cast, no icky fragrance and feels great on my skin with no breakouts or sunburn. I also like the pump dispenser. very convenient to use. * I normally don't leave reviews but, this sunscreen is amazing so it was time. 
My family and I have been using this for a few years now. I originally purchased a smaller bottle to try on my youngest daughter who has very sensitive skin. Every sunscreen I tried on her burnd her skin till I tried this sunscreen. We never looked back! As a family of 7 I quickly purchased the largest bottle and it last us a summer and a half with frequent use. My husband, children, and I are white hispanics and my niece is a dark hispanic and I am happy to say it doesn't leave that terrible white cast on any of us a lot of other sunscreens leave on the skin. Non of us think it's greasy and it has a subtle delightful sent. My husband would prefer the price be lower but he knows you pay good money for quality and it lasts us a long time so its now husband approved."

this for my face. Its Very overpriced. I love that it has high coverage. When applied to my face its very thick and I look shiny and I feel like I can see my sweat. And stings if used near eyes. I will only use it for my body. 
And i will not purchase again. * I have both lupus and a condition called MCAS- the latter essentially meaning I'm allergic to anything and everything, and the ""rules"" of what I'm allergic to changes daily- this is the one and ONLY sunscreen that doesn't cause my butterfly rash to burn or trigger an even worse full faced MCAS rash, and even better: no acne! Literally everything breaks me out or causes a reaction but not this. I am so happy to have found this SPF. My skin no longer feels like I'm pressed against a hot skillet when I have to be outside anymore. Of course, always wear a sunhat and clothing layers to protect your skin, too! But this truly is a miracle product for me. I hope to never be without it. Please, please, please, never discontinue or stop carrying this product. I was in tears to find something that works for me. I've never loved a peofuct more. * I love this sunscreen, was using the spf 60 and found this spf 100 at ulta. It's hard to find. The last few years I have developed a sensitivity to the sun beyond what normal people do. This stops my sun reactions and I don't look grey. Re-apply! * okay this sunscreen is actually really good! it doesnt break me out(which my skin is super sensitive to break outs and redness), gives me a slight glow, and obviously its spf 100 which is lovely for my fair skin. however, i play tennis a lot and even when im out for like 5 minutes and this is on my face i sweat like CRAZY even though im not even hot or tired or any of that. and when i actually do get hot and work out for a long time dear lord it looks like i just went on a 5k marathon through death valley. it doesnt bug me that much cause its protecting my skin but it is sorta annoying. also omg for the love of god do NOT get this anywhere near your eyes. i got this near my eyes and no matter how much i washed them or wiped my eyes my eyes were burning for 3+ hours. literally. they were watering so bad and i was blinking every millisecond and couldnt barely do anything. other than that its a really solid sunscreen if one you dont put it near your eyes and two you dont mind sweating(if youre being active/doing sports). * It's been too long since I last used sunscreen, but I recently started again because my skin tone was becoming uneven and the UV index has been high lately, ranging from 6 to 9 between 10 AM and 4 PM. I've noticed that my skin is returning to its regular shade. As a person with brown skin who spends about two hours a day in the sun, I recommend applying sunscreen every 90 minutes if you're exposed for a long time. It's a great product! * I honestly LOVE this formula. I was a little intimidated by the SPF 100 and was scared it was going to be thick and difficult to blend but I'm halway through my bottle and it's performing excellently! I've been using the SPF 60 for 3 years now and wanted to see if this was any different and I think I like this one better for makeup than the SPF 60. This one settles and dries down more than the SPF 60 surprisingly so I find it easier to apply makeup over this and I also dont feel like this gives me the ""sunscreen sheen"" on my face as much as fhe other one does which I found super surprising. There is a sliiight white cast but it's not really more noticeable than the SPF 60 white cast and both are pretty minimal. Can streak sometimes but that's very minimal too and I find it less streaky than the SPF 60 surprisingly. The only draw in my book is this tends to have a shorter expiration date than the SPF 60 but I'm sure it's hard to keep a ln SPF 100 formulation at 100 for an extended period of time. I hope they never discontinue this! Makes me feel more comfortable on the sunniest days (and ofc I reapply) * I use this specifically on my HEALED tattoos to keep them as protected as possible"

It didn't get into our eyes and face never got burned. Highly recommend! * Smells sweet and only slightly like sunscreen [for those who don't like the sunscreen smell].
It was easy to apply & handy to have for reapplication every 2 hours. I wanted to love it because of the high spf, how portable it was and how well it smelled but it containing alcohol was a big NO from me. The active ingredients, along with the alcohol and fragrance caused some major eye irritation. I ultimately returned it because my eyes burning was not worth the nice smell and high spf :(. * I have used numerous facial spray sunscreens and I've never had issues! I generally don't have issues with if any product - sunscreen, makeup, skincare, etc. The smell of this is good, but oh my goodness it broke me out so bad! Painful big pimples in the mix of hive like reaction. my face was itchy and it hurt. I wasn't sure if this was it, but it happened again after using it. It smells good but that added fragrance might be hurting my skin. I'll go back to my sunbum facial spray thats less than $10. * I work outside as a server and this sunscreen burns my eyes while im working it stings so bad and doesnt stop even after rinsing and washing my face. The coola makeup setting spray is better * packaging is horrible, the lid will not stay on no matter what you do and the spray is less of a fine mist and more of a direct shot. Your eyes won't burn when you first spray it,but 20 min later your eyes will be stinging uncomfortably for the rest of the day with no relief :) 2 stars because I think it protects from sun but its hard go get even coverage. Not worth it, just get a lotion * I loved the smell & this was working great for me. No issues, that is…until the bottle broke completly and spilled out majority of the product. I went on the Ulta app to check if it in stock at my location, but after reading some of these recent reviews of burning and skin damage….I am skeptical to repurchase it. I will try another brand. Seems like they maybe changed their formula. * I loved the smell & this was working great for me. No issues, that is…until the bottle broke completly and spilled out majority of the product.

It says it is a non-greasy formula… but that couldn't be farther from the truth. This is the most greasy sunscreen i have ever used. It can't be worn with any makeup because it causes the makeup to break up within 30 minutes of applying. You also cant wear mascara with this because the greasiness of the product will cause the mascara to transfer to your lid… even if its waterproof! It also oxidizes a LOT so keep that in mind. I definitely wont purchase ever again and wouldn't recommend to any skin types. * It feels like I'm putting on foundation and sometimes dries orange. It comes off so easily when sweating even after giving it time to soak in. Im pretty sure it also started to break me out too. Also with such a wide known brand, why not many different tints? Overall, could be better in all aspects. * I am 60something and tend to have dry skin.  when I found this moisturizing sunscreen I was excited.  what I didn't know is that it turned into a makeup primer on my face!  Worked beautifully under my CC cream and then set it with a mineral powder * I can't say with absolute certainty that this product broke me out, but I can say I tried it for six days and broke out in spots I don't usually break out. I checked the ingredients on an online ""pore-clogging ingredient checker"" and found that this product DOES have pore-clogging ingredients. Although correlation doesn't equal causation - this product feels a little thick, making it a little hard to blend. It also feels oily/greasy on my face. It was a relief to see that it does have pore-clogging ingredients because that meant I could throw it away and feel a little less guilty about it. It's a shame because I love Cerave's AM lotion with sunscreen, and this product is budget friendly. If you have extra cash, try this product out. It might be for you, it just wasn't for me. On to the next! * The best face sunscreen I've tried for my oily skin and gives my skin enough sheer tint that I can skip my foundation!!!! * ive been using it for about two months but im not gonna repurchase it. its too oliy for my and i have combo skin. however i dont put selt tanner on my face, so it being dark balances out my skin tone between my face and neck. but melt off of me bc of my skin type. i feel like it would be better on tan and dry skin girlies * I have very fair skin and I love how it makes my skin look! It gives my arms and legs a nice glow! Great for when you are not at the pool or beach and need protection. However, I prefer the Avene tinted sunscreen for my face."

You can't go wrong with this purchase! * Honestly, I love this product so much. I just wish it would've been a little more tinted to cover up my hyperpigmentation from acne scars that I love this. I use it on a daily basis and will always recommend for my girls.🩷 * Did not go well with my moisturizer it started to pill, re cleansed my skin and just applied it alone and it left a white cast.

So I have been on the lookout for primers and/or mattifying sunscreens to combat this issue. I just happened to stumble across this product when i was looking for a mineral sunscreen for my face. I balked at the price but then saw it was also a mattifying primer so i took a chance. I've been wearing it for weeks, both by itself and under makeup. I'm glad I took a chance because it has solved all of my issues. It also really blurs my enlarged pores!

Within an hour the five of us that used this had burned backs, despite not getting in water yet.   The other two were fine. Also, once in water,  eyes started burning, this stuff is not waterproof. * This sunscreen was ineffective in the sun. I applied it twice during my beach trip and it left my face burnt and with a ton of zits. If you have acne prone skin I do not recommend. In addition if you plan on using for a beach/pool day I don't recommend as it doesn't provide coverage. * Terrible, would not soak in, even when applied 30+ minutes before leaving the house in AC.  Product would slip and create white streaks the moment I started sweating.  Stung my eyes since it doesn't soak in, also caused breakouts * This sunscreen left my face burned and covered in acne the day after using. I applied the sunscreen twice during my beach day and it did not help protect my skin. My nose and cheeks are so red and to top it off it clogged my pores so bad I have a ton of zits! Do not recommend if you have acne prone skin and are wanting to use it for a beach/pool day. * Leaves a bad white cast, doesn't blend in well, and makes you look really sweaty after a few hours * This sunscreen was not greasy, but it does leave behind a slight residue. It blends in really quickly and doesn't leave a white cast on me. My only complaint is the smell. It does not smell great, I would best describe it as a chemical, powdery sunscreen smell. The scent lasts for quite a long time as well. There are other sunscreens that I prefer that don't have an unpleasant scent that I prefer, but overall this is a solid sunscreen."

It's rather expensive though for what you get- considering it's a body sunscreen, this wouldn't even get you through a week at the beach. * No matter which supergoop I try they are heavy greasy they do block the sun but feel horrible * Me gusta mucho, no deja la piel grasosa, te da brillo y protege * Absolutely terrible! I broke out in a rash about an hour after using. Theew it away immediately! * I love the OG unseen sunscreen for my face and its the perfect texture and viscosity. I was hoping this would be too. I hate the lotion texture of others so i was really excited that SG came out witb this. The only problem is that its just oily… it absorbs well and makes my skin feel REALLY SOFT but since i do sweat pretty easily it can feel a bit slick at times. Maybe its the olive oil in it? Or its just too many oils. * Goes on like silk and absorbs quickly. * This is a unique sunscreen. It slides onto my skin without an oily feel and immediately disappears like water. I like working in the yard. The Unseen Sunscreen Body enables me to be outside without getting a tan or sunburn in this hot summer sun. Other brands of sunscreen have felt oily and were a bit difficult to apply without some effort. The Supergoop! spread easily. It was a delightful surprise!"

I have been looking for sunscreen with glitter and the stick gives a subtle sparkle without looking like you got attacked by a child's craft project. The price is also great - you get enough product to try before you decide if you want a full size. * yeah I had high hopes for this because it looks so pretty and shimmery in the ads but it straight up doesn't work. I was reapplying it every 30 minutes and I burned SO SO bad. very sad :( * This kit is a home run.  #1 Love the Sun Shield in a new travel friendly size.  The stick is BOMB!  I wouldn't necessarily describe it as glittery at all.  It's more of a sun-kissed glisten effect.  Soft Shield is my new fave primer. 💕❤️⛱️ Kopari * I wanted to try all 3 of these items, so I was excited to get this set. I hate the stick since it contains chunky gold glitter pieces. If they removed the glitter, it would be a great sunscreen stick. The liquid body sunscreen is nice and has a very light golden glow to it and thankfully, no glitter. The face cream is also nice, and I wanted to try it before buying a full size. The amount however, is more like a very tiny free sample size rather than a travel size that you would pay for, but okay enough since you only need a small amount to cover your whole face. It applies more like a serum. Overall, I'm glad I tried it and will purchase the full-sized face and body sunscreens, but I will not be able to use the stick at all because of the glitter."

It gave me acne and the worst, gave me sun damage and freckles!

Effective, no odor, smooth and non greasy * Bought this based off of the reviews here and I am so glad I did. I was looking for a sunscreen specifically for face. This was exactly what i was looking for. It's clear, not sticky, glides on smoothly, conveniently sized. I need something to quickly put on before running out the door and this makes it easy to apply all over the face and neck area. I havent used this under makeuo yet but i am sure it wouldnt be an issue since there is no residue it leaves on the skin, it is truly smooth and feels like nothing is on. The only possible con for some might be that there is a slight fragrance. It is a VERY subtle fragrance, it reminds me of Softsoap handsoap, but it does not linger by any means. It's more like once you apply it its there but vanishes within a min maybe less? It didnt cause any irritation whatsoever. * I bought this to take on a trip and i could definitely see the difference between spots that I used the stick vs missed spots. Doesn't feel greasy and I love how easy it is to carry in my purse so I can reapply more frequently. * Bought this to try a stick cause since typical cream sunscreen always ends up in my eye I sweat and causes my eyes to sting. Used it for the first time on a lake day and only applied once - my face and neck were the only two body parts that left without sunburn. It's now my go to for everyday use, glides on super smooty, doesnt leave a film, and doesnt feel heavy on your face. Okay Im done rambling now, just go buy it. * I have sensitive skin and combination oily/dry skin. Tried this sunscreen for a couple months. I started to break out with big and painful acne which I hadn't had for many years. Would not recommend for acne prone skin. * I do not have sensitive skin, mostly normal sometimes a little dry depending on season. I was excited to try this sunscreen stick since it's very popular. It leaves the skin super shiny, and it broke me out so much. It really clogged my pores. * It's expensive and worth every penny. 

I have very fair skin and never got a burn while using this. It doesn't melt in the heat and has no overpowering fake smell. 

I've recommended this to so many people and have them hooked as well. The moment they try mine they're blown away by how it doesn't feel like a typical sunscreen."

It pills on my skin and separates so badly, it's in chunks when I try to get product out, which is pretty gross.

This deserves negative stars and ruined my skin for a year and a half now. I've been battling flares and opened my skin up to other sensitivities. This product is horrible and check the photo turned my entire neck red, dark, itchy. Even when the itch went away left me with SUCH BAD PIGMENT all around my eyes and mouth/chin that I've now been battling for over a year. DO NOT GET * It's a very runny texture and it goes on super light and it doesn't have any scent and it's not sticky. However, the packaging is poor. Since it's runny, they should made the whole smaller or use a different method. I do not need this to drip all over my top every time I use it. Without any effort, it squirts out of the bottle.

I use self tanner but this was my first big day in the hot summer sun. * I love Coola sunscreen. The spray applies well. I bought the travel size since I was going on vacation and only bringing a carry on and the regular size would be too big. I was a tad disappointed that these did not last the entire week. My husband and I were the only ones using the spray and we brought 2 new travel bottles with us, but they only made it to about 2/3 of the vacation. It would be nice if there was a TSA approved size that could go a little further. Besides that though, it had a good application that lasted well and as always, I love the scent. * Its an anazing product. Snells anazing, and definitely fets the job done. My only negative is that its a chemical sunscreen. Great for occational use, but not a daily summer sunscreen bc of that. * My husband and I had the worst experience with this product today, so I ran to the reviews to see if others had a problem with it. Sure enough, others mentioned that they burned badly & quickly when using this product. We spent 1 hour in overcast weather, me wearing a long sleeve hoodie, before the sun came out and we decided to wear our T shirts and SPF. We were super confused when very shortly afterwards, we were BURNED!! This wasn't the most intense sun either. I tried to protect myself & my husband with this product and it caused more harm than good. 0/10, don't even risk it. * I used this sunscreen at the beach and didnt get sunburnt at all! I have very sensitive skin and burn very badly. It was easy to apply, not greasy, and fragrance free. My only reason for giving 4 stars is the price and if you go in the water it'll wash off immediately. But I would still buy it again for another beach trip! * The smell was so strong. It smelled extremely fake, like a chemical. I couldn't try it in the store, so I tried it when I got home and returned it the next day. 
It is not something to buy because it is easy to apply. * I just bought a bottle one month ago and it's empty. I dont over spray and maybe use it every weekend. it costs to mucj to go through it so fast."

However, my eyebrows and any contact with the under eyes was insane. Burning, itchy, puffy, allergic reaction type symptoms. Never have reacted to any product and I have had success with neutrogena and other hydro boost products. This one is a no for me personally. Could not continue using knowing the burning allergic reaction/chemical burn feeling on my eyebrows specifically. * This product is hydrating and does absorb into skin well if you rub it in well. It can look greasy and feel greasy because it tends to seperate in the bottle. It would be great but unfortunately it burns the heck out of my eyes, even when I try to avoid the eye area it still makes my eyes sting and water. It also taste like sunscreen.

The smell is also a dream but not so powerful that it messes with my other perfumes. Get this if you wanna look FLAWLESS in this hot summer sun! * I must admit I have not used this  as an SPF, so can't speak to its effectiveness in that respect. If you were looking to use this to add a ""glow"" or shimmer to tan skin like I did, it just doesn't deliver. It works ok as a body oil, but not worth the price for that use. * Do not use this as SPF!! It smells great and adds a pretty shimmer to the skin but it doesnt work as sun protection even though it markets 45spf. I applied this 4 tomes in 4 hours while at the pool and still burned.

This stuff is ANAZING for the face, many days at the river last summer and no burnt cheeks for me 🙏 its super lightweight which i appreciate since i get plenty greasy on my own during the hotter months.
Not to mention its water resistant and reef safe, two very important things for me in a sunscreen. * First off, in allergic to coconut oil so its hard for ke to fond sunscreens that work for me. This one is PERFECT!!! It doesn't feel like sunscreen and it blends into my skin beautifully. Definitely worth trying!! * An associate recommended my this sunscreen last year and I've been using it since! I can't comment on pilling since i stopped wearing foundation and concealer, but I do have sensitive acne prone skin and this has never broke me out. This is my go-to! * I've used this in the past and it worked fine. I think i put the sunscreen a little too close to my eyes because i must've sweat which made it run into my eyes. My face and eyes were swollen for 3 days and now my face is constantly extremely dry and flaking everywhere. I'm now frequently exfoliating and moisturizing my face to get my skin back to normal. Made my vacation in the Bahamas pretty miserable * I love using this sunscreen when I dont wear my tinted sunscreen. This sunscreen doesn't leave a white cast. It goes on smoothly.

Sunscreen is apart of my daily routine, and I frequently wear mineral sunscreen on my face. This is an oily mess, i love vacation but this is a miss. I am very fair skinned and it left a white cast on me. * This is my new go to! I love that it's mineral based to protect my skin as much as possible. I love the milky consistency and it blends into my skin and doesn't leave any whitecast - it feels like skincare and sunscreen all in one and doesnt make my face feel dry at all! It's great on it's own or under make-up. My only critique is that I wish it didn't have such a strong fragrance but that is just personal preference! * If your skin isnt fair, this sunscreen will leave a white cast and its reslly obvious. Im not a fan of this sundcreen and i wont buy it again. It also leaves your face very oily. * I really like this facial sunscreen.  I like the way it feels going on.  It is a mineral sunscreen that doesn't leave a white cast on the skin.  Most importantly, it doesn't contain any icky ingredients that are harmful to your health. * Overall this is a remarkable sunscreen for the US market. Did not leave a white cast, the packaging is thoughtful and creative, it actually protects your skin, all those good things. I wore it for two weeks straight for a vacation & ran into two issues with it: over that extended period of time, it seemed to build up on my face and leave me with textural issues. I suspect this is because I didn't have access to any cleansing oils + was in new locations with different water, so I'm not going to place that blame on Vacation. I would just use a cleansing oil in the future. The scent, however, is my bigger issue. It smells delightful, I just don't want scented products for my face. Vacation does seem to be receptive to feedback, so hopefully one day we'll get an unscented version. If and when that happens, this will be the holy grail of sunscreens. * This is a great mineral sunscreen that has a milky consistency and leaves no whitecast on my porcelain skin. The only con is the strong cucumber smell. * Really, Vacation? This particular sunscreen is very nice and i'd even say innovative and thoughtfully designed. Vacation is also well known, loved and established. So my question is why all these bogus reviews? So unnecessary! Most have the same format, language and the same date. Come on.

Back to the product. I am a black woman with a caramel toned complexion. After complete application, there is a slight but tolerable white cast. It does have a fairly strong scent but not unpleasant or crazy. It's easy to apply and the coverage is light with a satin finish.  

I would repurchase and recommend."

It really holds up to its name. I've been looking at this brand for months and finally got it. I've only been using this for a little under a week but this by far, has been the best SPF moisturizer I've EVER used. Someone who works at Ulta said this was a really great product; she was correct. What sold me is when she said it holds up really well for people who have oily skin, which is an issue for me so I have an issue with products that make my skin extra oily. This is very lightweight and worth the money. I just need to see how this holds up with this FL heat. * I thought this was the perfrct match for me as i am lazy and hate having to layer moisturizer with an SPF and get greasy quick. This dries down matte at first but within an hour or so is super greasy and makes my face very shiny. For the price I expected better. * I tend to find most sunscreens to be greasy, oily, or sticky even when they claim otherwise. I assumed this would be the same especially since its a sunscreen moisturizer combo. However I was wrong!  The texture and finish is so so lovely. It's very lightweight and glides on nicely, moisturizes without leaving me feeling like a shiny greasy mess! It's perfect under make too. Highly recommend! * It is weightless but it burns yours eyes terribly when you go to take it off ...and it's not sweat proof...for the almost $50 this is I expect more out of a spf moisturizer. There are drugstore brands that can offer the same for a way less price point. Definitely returning. * For some reason, every other facial sunscreen I've tried either made my face red and hot, had a sticky texture, or made my skin bumpy and textured afterwards. This is the only sunscreen without any of these issues! It feels like a regular, lightweight moisturizer in every way, and washes off easily without any texture or stickiness. * I love this moisturizer! it's super lightweight and there's no strong spf smell. it doesn't feel like i'm wearing anything and it doesn't break me out at all (like most sunscreens normally do) * Unfortunately this is a miss for me. The texture is that of a mild moisturizer, which is great, but the chemical filters in this sunscreen leave a lot to be desired. It has a sunscreen smell that lingers, and also stings my eyes."

Cons- not water proof and cap cracked and disintegrated with the heat and oil. * The packaging is beautiful but it's glass and that is kind of pain to handle. It's VERY VERY oily. It's a slick oil like the Hawaiian Tropic oil. So you cannot touch anything or sit on anything besides a towel once applied. Have only tried it once and it maybe gave a color boost but nothing too crazy. Would probably love it if it were more of dry oil. It's a little pricey for just a tanning oil with an SPF.

This may give you a nice glow, after you use enough to not streak bc it does not spread easily, but it will ruin everything it touches. It will stain all cloths it comes in contact with and will not wash out. Save your money, its a horrible product! * I had high hopes because I love Vacation products. This lotion, while it adds a nice color to your skin, is horrible in every other aspect. It bleeds all over any fabric it touches, is not waterproof and; therefore, even sweating causes it streak and stain anything it touches. Would give zero stars if possible! * This will stain your clothes. This will stain anything you touch. Don't sweat. Don't go in the water. It doesn't go on evenly, and it doesn't stay on at all. This product is garbage. Maybe someone who is tanner than I am might like this product because it is sunscreen that doesn't leave a white cast. I don't understand the positive reviews. * This stuff does not blend well at all. Does not go on even. Its is extrnsly messy and transfers to everything and does not come out of clothes/linens. It also has a strong unpleasant smell. Would not recommend. * Like others have said, this will stain your suit and any cover-ups. It stained the inside of my denim shorts. Even after washing, the inside is still stained a brown hue. 
It also smells slightly like you just got back from an airbrush tan. 
My skin looks great once I get it all rubbed in, but it's just not sustainable to re-apply at the beach or pool if you don't have baby wipes or something to use to get it off your hands. This is a no for me. * A little goes a long way. I love that its a cream not a foam this makes it easy to apply. I only applied it on my legs. It did not turn my skin orange.  Not even my hands!! And No, I did NOT wear gloves, with the foam tanning I also wear gloves.  I haven't tried swimming with it on, but after showering its still on!! I will definitely purchase this product in the future."

Im really picky about my choice of sunscreen, well let me tell you this is a high quality moisturizer for me and I've been using it each morning! My skin feels great and it protects me, I haven't been sunburned since using it. I reapply if I'm outside working and sweating, so make sure to do that! Yes I recommend, I'm already ordering a 2nd bottle, you get a lot of product for a low price compared to others on the market. This works as well as, or better than prestige brands, IMO. Its non greasy and actually moisturizing too! Really happy i took a chance on this one. I live in Southern California and the sun is always out, so wearing sunscreen is not an option! * Love the scent and how easily it applies (like any typical lotion).  The pump is amazing - loved it for putting lotion on me and the kids before we left the house.  Everyone would comment on the wonderful beachy scent (banana/coconut). * I love this sunscreen! It's not too greasy, easy to apply, and protected me from sunburns. Smells amazing too, just like summer. * While this absorbs super fast and is very lightweight, after being outside for an hour and a half, I still burned. I use the regular SPF70 all the time and swear by it but I won't be using this particular product again. I think it's great as an everyday moisturizer with minimal sun exposure but if you are spending any length of time outside, use the regular sunscreen. Don't be a tomato like me * I used to wear another brand of daily sunscreen and it was discontinued. Thank you Sun Bum for developing this product! It is perfect! It is not thick and heavy like most sunscreens and it does not irritate my sensitive skin. The lotion absorbs well and smells great. * I've been looking for a body sunscreen that I can wear daily, but many body sunscreens left a sticky, greasy film that felt uncomfortable on the skin. This, on the other hand, is moisturizing but not suffocating, and most importantly, it blends in with ease. It is good for dry weather and if you want that dewy glow."

Frustrating purchase! * I live on an island and absolutely don't leave the house without sunscreen, but I've never found a product that I loved for my face until now. I have combination skin and Unseen Sunscreen has become my new daily. It is smooth as silk and feels identical to Smashbox primer, if you've tried that. It absorbs almost immediately but leaves my skin soft and ready for makeup, but I think it blurs well enough that l dont need makeup (I'm in my 40's). This little sample tube has lasted me two weeks of daily use and it's finally running low. I use an amount the size of my index nail and it's enough for my face, neck, and the backs of my hands. I read some reviews questioning the SPF value, but they seemed unfounded and I wonder if those reviewers were using authentic product. 

Yesterday I went out boating for four hours and I relied only on this little kit. The Refresh spray was nice for reapplication, which I only remembered once, halfway through the day. I didn't get burned at all, even under these harshest conditions. 

The Play Everyday lotion was fine. It worked well and I definitely would have burned without it, as I missed a few spots and am absolutely fried. It just doesn't stand out above other sunblocks to me. 

Nonetheless, I'm very happy that I ordered this kit. These aren't cheap products but the quality is excellent and I don't skimp on skincare. This kit allows you to try each and see how your skin responds before investing in larger sizes. * These are so small they should be free samples. I haven't even used them yet, but I should have looked more closely at the size before ordering. The price is way too high for these tiny bottles. You will basically get one or two applications with each. * I have bought this twice and it is such good value and it lasts a while. * I love this product but the bag (a big asset on why I bought this set) is an ok sized bag that feels cardboardy. The sizes of the products are pretty reasonable. The ""Unseen Sunscreen"" is very soft and silky. None of the products leave my skin with white cast or oil and grease. My skin feels amazing after using this product. I would recommend this set or even the full size of all these products. Over I would recommend this! * Cheap way to try 3 sunscreens! Loved both the lotions but wasn't a big fan of the spray. It felt greasy. * Not worth the price.  I can get a larger size in a less expensive brand. Not happy"

It looks undetectable and smells fine (keep your eyes closed). But, I noticed I would break out in rash or acne after using it. It may not be the only thing causing the acne, but a contributing factor. Use with caution. I would not recommend this to a friend. * Honestly a very underwhelming setting spray. Unfortunately it leaves my fave feeling aticky and the sunscreen scent is very overpowering! * I really wanted to love this product and i was so excited to try it. I was hoping i would like it better than elfs other sunscreen and it would also set my makeup. But it didnt really set my makeup and it is super strong. When i sprayed it i had to close my eyes for about 10 seconds after i sprayed because it would burn my eyes. If you are looking for a sunscreen dont waste your money on this one, i even got a sunburn with this on. I dont use it anymore and i do not recommend. * Very oily setting spray and caused my makeup to separate. After using it by itself, towards the end of the day it started burning my eyes, still not sure exactly why. It smells good but wouldn't recommend for oily/combination skin, broke me out. * As soon as I bought this product, I was so excited because it's been on my wishlist for like ever and then as soon as I spray my room, my eyes burnt like crazy and so did my skin and then I kept spraying it to feel like oh maybe it's supposed to happen then I washed my face after that. I read the reviews and I wasn't shocked on other peoples experiences with this product, maybe it will be good for your body than your face but still I want to take a chance. This is pure trash, pure garbage they're selling to these kids and people do not buy this. Do not waste your money buy something else please do not take a product, and I had eye infections before because I have very sensitive eyes and skin, but thank God this product didn't give me an eye infection but it didn't make my eyes puffy for 2 to 3 days. Do not waste your money on this buy something else with the money you spent on this * I'll admit this is my first time trying a setting spray so maybe I just don't know that this is how they all feel but it leaves behind such a strange, almost itchy feeling on your face. It also gets on your shirt/hands (not sure how lol) and feels almost chalky. Idk, I love the idea of the product and I'lll continue to use it but I don't think I'd buy it again. * I regularly wear a chemical sunscreen moisturizer and a mineral sunscreen primer under my makeup. I bought this to try as a way to refresh my sunscreen over my makeup. I followed directions- shook thoroughly and sprayed over my normal spf and makeup. The next morning I woke up with a chemical burn everywhere this spray had touched with my eyes nearly swollen shut. Elf is buying their reviews on this product. The elf suntouchable all set for sun spray should be pulled off the shelves."

Returned. * Will burn the crap out of your eyes! Soooo swollen and burning all day * Been using this for a couple months on pool days and on a vacation to Cabo. I love this because it is a mist that can go on over your makeup and places like hairline where other sunscreen forms arent ideal. 
My fav sunscreen mist! * I love how this spray is such a fine mist it can go on vare skin without feeling greasy or sticky and it goes on beautifully over makeup to make sure tour skin is protected no matter where youre going! * I like the mist of this product. It doesn't leave you white like other sunblock. I personally use it on my body vs my face as I already use my daily SPF face lotion. (My toddler and husband use on their face). The smell isn't overwhelming either. * I usually love all of Sun Bums products but this was a no for me! first the packaging is cute, but it is flimsy and the spray nozzle leaks and feels like it's barely hanging on. The sunscreen itself left me greasy and kept running into my eyes and making them burn. The smell was nice, though! I've been using this to spray my scalp and my kids scalps where their part is so that doesn't burn, but I don't want to put this on my face anymore. * The directions say not to spray directly onto face. Why is the name of the product Face Mist? The point of having an spf face mist is so that you dont have to rub it in and can spritz it over make-up. I love so many Sun Bum products, but this is pointless."

Blondes beware! I just hope my hairstylist can fix the awful color this stuff has turn my hair. * I was trying this on at the store and before I sprayed it on my scalp some of the liquid got on my  finger it burned my finger and left small little cuts * My girls and I all have parts in our hair that get blistered when we are outside. We took this to the beach last weekend and tried it - all of us got blistered AND the product made our hair really disgusting afterwards. Hoping to return and refund. * This spray works perfectly for those who burn easily and want to protext their scalp. This kept me from burning and it smells great. I do with the bottle was bigger because it is more expensive so I wish you got more product * I got this to use on my toddler blonde thin hair. It worked but completely changed his hair to light brown. * It works for an SPF, but dries out my hair. Too expensive for the size. I would recommend Sun Bum even with the defective nosle. * I'm constantly dying my hair crazy colors and need all the protection I can get! I just recently found this brand and I'm in love. It is a little bit on the pricey side, but I'm always willing to spend it if the product works! I bought it for vacation for 115 degree weather and swimming and it worked like a dream. It protected my entire head, kept my color from fading from chlorine, smells fantastic, and didn't feel oily/greasy or anything!"

Developed into a heat rash and now I cant go in the sun and I'm miserable wirh itching. Would not recommend. * I love this!! First iff, it smells amazing. I havent smelled the perfume but if it smells like this I will be buying it!!! I have pretty sensitive skin (&eczema) so I have to be careful about what I use on my skin. This didn't irritate my skin at all. It gave my olive skin a nice bronzey glow (my phototype is between a 3&4) without looking like a fake tan. Its similar to Sol De Janeiro Glow Oil in Copacabana which i also love, but this has actual SPF so that makes it better!! It also absorbs better than SDJ. * I love the shimmer in this beautiful SPF oil. I dont find it to be glittery at all. If im buying something called ""shimmer,"" i want some shimmer, and this has enough to be visible but not overwhelming. I'm tired of products claiming to have shimmer that just have a greasy shine without actual sparkle. You can rub this around to minimize the shimmer - it can get quite subtle if you prefer, or layer it if you want more sparkle. The scent is nice too, not too strong. * Im glad to report i didn't experience anything negative from this like some reviews say. This product is amazing , i get so many compliments on how pretty this shimmer leaves my arms and legs 😍 * This product works better than the higher end products. The quality is amazing for the price. The glitter glow literally GLOWS and lasts all day. I wore this product to sleep and worked out in it and it stays on. A plus that is smells amazing. * This product was DANGEROUS for me, my skin (mostly arms) had the worse reaction to it and broke out completely in hives. 
I'm a huge fan of the Vacation brand products. I especially enjoy their SPF baby oil, so I couldn't wait to try the shimmer oil. I've never had this reaction to any sunscreens, oils, fragrances or anything really but this was BAD.

The worse part is it's been around 5 days and my skin is still itchy and broken out. Do not recommend (ironically especially don't try it while on vacation like me!) * I rarely return things but I had to remove this from my life after 1 wear. I don't know if I'm the Vacation audience - as I live very far from a beach - but I have very fair skin and fantasized a bronzy, glamorous way to get a little SPF and a nice scent in the summer. Sadly this wasn't what I imagined. It's very oily, and throughout the many hours I wore it, it never absorbed. If it's hot you'll be sticky and greasy. The ""shimmer"" looks like actual glitter flecks on the skin rather than a nice glisten. (Took multiple showers to fully remove the glitter.) The glitter got on all my clothes and the oil left marks on my car seats. Lastly, being as pale as I am it made me look actually yellow.

Again, maybe I'm not the target audience, maybe if I were purely wearing this to lay by the pool it'd be fine.. but I find it pretty impractical for just a normal day-type body care product. Smells good, but I'd rather just buy the perfume."

Ummm girls what more do you need to know. Get itttttt. 
Yes it's pricey but this is a holy grail! It even looks so nice under makeup, it had a little bit of tack so it really does act as a primer :) run dont walk * It made my makeup look horrible after about 4 hours. Blotchy and streaky. Definitely returning! * I bought this a few months ago.  On every occasion I used it, it broke me out.  I break out from silicones, so I am guessing the culprit is octyldodecanol.  It is not a silicone, but it is often used as a substitute for silicones and acts in a similar wat.   It looked far enough down the ingredient list that it might not impact my skin, but it did every single time (with no other changes in my skincare or makeup routine that might have caused it instead).  Pretty sure I am past any return window for Ulta unfortunately.   

Pros:  no white cast, applies smoothly, not drying * I break out from every sunscreen, but this product is safe and gentle on my face without feeling uncomfortable or difficult to apply. I have a true medium skintone and it does leave a white cast on my skin. Thats the only reason why its 4 stars instead of 5. * I really wanted to love this product but unfortunately it left a white cast on my medium-dark skin tone. If I mixed it with other skin care it would get dry and patchy but even with nothing else it had a prominent white cast."

Not worth it!! * I don't know what was in this sunscreen, but I was really looking forward to a convenient spray SPF. I put it on my forearms and neck in late morning and was put off by the scent, but brushed it off. Later that night, I noticed small, red pinpricks all over my arms. I woke up the next morning and the dots had become red bumps, and were noticeable over my neck, looking similar to acne. As of now, about 36 hours later, my arms are still covered in bumps, though they are no longer red. I have no known allergies, so I don't know what caused this reaction. All this to say, I have not enjoyed this experience, and the scent is unpleasant anyways."

It's dropping a lil bit now to save face later. Skin cancer runs in my family (with 2 grandparents and 1 parent having chunks removed from their face and body).... So I am obsessive about avoiding it. I'm not going to get any pretty missing part of my nose lol. This stuff glides on smoothly on top of other skincare products. Make sure your face is dry enough. I don't want to scratch it off my face immediately after applying. It's high allergy season where I live so can't comment on the smell. * I'm an esthetician and have some of the oiliest skin. I would always skip SPF if I was wearing makeup because  many of them I've tried, make my makeup break down faster throughout the day. I tried this one out after trying it out in the store and to me it absorbs like a dry oil, and I can't feel it on my skin after a few minutes. I haven't had any issues with my skin over producing oil while wearing this alone or under makeup. I hope they don't stop making this product! * This goes on really nice on my face. It literally glides on like butter without the greasy feeling. I like that it has shimmer but it does not show up on your face as glitter, it's more of a glowy satin finish. I haven't noticed any pilling on bare skin or with makeup. I've paired this with Bare Minerals tinted moisturizer and it looks great. When pairing with makeup i put it on before my makeup. * I thought I'd give this a try when it was on sale and so glad I did! I wasn't using any sunscreen in my morning routine at the time. Most sunscreens I've used are thick. This one goes on lightweight and gives a sheer satin finish. I love it! * I love this product. It feels like satin going on my skin. It is absorbed instantly.The scent is great and doesn't smell like sunscreen. I actually apply it everyday first thing in the morning. * Melts into my skin and is so sensitive and gentle. I use the face and the body. I love both. I get a little glow too! * This is one of my favorite face sunscreens by far! It goes on well snd geels great on! It gives a nice blurred effect on my face."

I use a bike for transport so start my day with sunscreen which I re-apply several times through the day. I tried this as I find most sunscreens to be incredibly drying. This soaks into my skin nicely and my skin is more nourished than it has been for months. It is spendy but I am super happy with it. * I will say, this did not provide the glow that I wanted it to when applying, but what a GREAT sunscreen. I've been using this at the pool at summer and It stays on even after a quick dip and doesn't smell trashy. I re-apply every two hours and have not burned once, and still come home with a wonderful suntanned-glow. * This stuff is very pretty and also goes on very easily, but do not use it by itself if you do not want to get burned. Definitely put on sunscreen first and then this on top so you dont get fried in the sun (like i did) * This suscreen smells so nice, isnt slimy or sticky, and adds a healthy looking gooe to the skin! 
It layers nicely with body bronzers and contouring without looking like an oily body builder tan. * Thankfully I didn't experience any allergic reactions- but there is zero shimmer / glow. 
None of the glitter comes thru when this sunscreen is applied. I also don't think it's that effective as far as the SPF goes. * Recently use for the first time and put it on my arms and legs, next day I woke up I had a rash all over. I do have keratosis pilaris so wasnt sure if I was just having a flare up but it started itching bad everywhere. Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin. * I reapplied this sunscreen NUMEROUS times during my three hours of sun exposure and when I say I burned, I mean I BURNED. I had to sleep with cold wash cloths on my body to get any relief. 
The product looks so pretty and smells amazing, but absolutely nothing could convince me to use this product again. I might've developed trust issues thanks to this sunscreen… it should come with a side of therapy because I may never be able to confidently purchase an SPF product again. Yes, I hurt that bad."

Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation. It has Benzophenone in it, which can cause contact  dermatitis. I get an allergic reaction on my eyelids every time I've used this product. * OMG this is the best sunscreen I've found for my skin, it's refreshing and soft and doesn't leave your skin white or thought of it. I loved it * Goes on white but leaves no white cast on brown skin after rubbing it in. I love how the spray disperses the product evenly. I dont recommend using it on your face directly though. Steep price for an average sunscreen. * This sunscreen is great. I have very oily acne prone skin and this rubs in well and does not make me greasy at all unlike other sunscreens. * I wanted to love this product because it's light, absorbs well, no white cast. But it is irritating and burning my eyes, even when I don't apply it anywhere near my eyes. I look like I cried all day, not cute."

This SPF is perfect for this dreadful Texas humidity and heat. It's very lightweight, non-greasy, and has a pleasant scent. Reapplying is a breeze since the product doesn't build up on the skin or cause a film. It's very breathable and works well with general skin sensitivities. The size is quite large for travel, but still small enough to throw in your beach bag and still have space for other necessities. It has a click-locking spray top so it doesn't accidentally spray in your bag. I will say that if your skin is very dry, you may want to go for a cream SPF because this does not provide much moisture. This is definitely made for hot, sunny summers. I love it and I know for sure I am buying a full-sized bottle to keep on hand.

***This review was collected as part of a promotion.*** * As a professional in the beauty industry, I've learned firsthand the  importance of sun protection, making COOLA's  spray an indispensable asset. In an industry where skincare is very important, COOLA stands out with its dedication to not only protecting against harmful UV rays but also enhancing the overall experience of sun care.

COOLA's sunscreen spray doesn't just shield your skin from UVA and UVB rays; Its broad-spectrum protection ensures comprehensive coverage, safeguarding against both premature aging and potential skin damage. As someone deeply invested in skin health, I love COOLA's commitment to providing a product that protects and cares for my skin.

The scent of Piña Colada fragrance is delicious. Gone are the days of sunscreen smelling like, well, sunscreen. Instead, COOLA's tropical scent transports me to my last vacation. It's a big change from the clinical smell of traditional sunscreens, making the application process a sensory experience.

I did not have any issue in my delicate skin but I always recommend  a patch test.

In my personal opinion, COOLA's in spray isn't just a sun protection product; it's an  evolution of skincare. With its comprehensive protection, anti-aging benefits, and irresistible Piña Colada scent, COOLA has redefined what it means to stay safe in the sun. So, whether I am lounging by the pool or hitting the beach, I make COOLA my go-to companion for summer adventures. And a big pus smells delicious! * The COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a delightful sun protection experience. Its tropical scent evokes visions of sunny beaches and relaxation, enhancing the application process with a touch of indulgence. The organic formula boasts SPF 30, providing reliable protection against both UVA and UVB rays, crucial for preventing sunburn and long-term skin damage. What sets this sunscreen apart is its lightweight texture, which absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. This feature is particularly appealing for those who dislike the heavy feeling often associated with sunscreen application. The spray mechanism ensures effortless and even coverage, making it convenient for reapplication throughout the day, especially during outdoor activities. Furthermore, the use of organic ingredients adds to its appeal for those who prioritize natural  products. 

 In conclusion, the COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a luxurious and effective sun protection solution for those who appreciate both quality and indulgence in their routine. * As a licensed Esthetician, we our taught early on how important using SPF to protect our skin. This aerosol is easy to use and smells amazing! If you have sensitive skin I would recommend spraying into your hands first then applying. I did have a slightly burning feel when I sprayed directly. But, overall I really love how cute and small and effective this spf is to use. My skin adapted the more I used this spf. * I love this sunscreen! Its perfect for travel and smells great. I used it almost all up on my recent vacation. It smells likea tropical holiday on a beach with a coconut. I would definetly recommend. I know the spf is quality and better packaged and easily portable. * This review was collected as part of a promotion. My name is Michele and I'm a Beauty Expert in my early 30's with fair combination skin. As the weather gets warmer, I have to make sunscreen a priority in my skincare routine. I am absolutely loving the Coola Clear Spray Body Sunscreen SPF 30 Piña Colada Sunscreen. I love its yummy, natural Piña Colada scent. It takes me away on a vacation to my favorite beach. This is a non-aerosol sunscreen that is so easy to spray onto your skin. It has a lightweight, lighter than air, mist texture that absorbs so quickly into my skin without leaving any greasy residue. I got the chance to try the full size 6 fluid ounce version of this spray sunscreen. This sunscreen is formulated with at least 70% Organic Ingredients. You get broad spectrum SPF 30 UVA and UVB protection. This sunscreen has water resistance that lasts up to 80 minutes so you can enjoy more time in the sun and water without worrying about reapplying every hour. With this amazing sunscreen you not only protect your skin but keep it hydrated too. Plant Protection is formulated with antioxidant rich nutrients which help fight free radicals, hydrates and nourishes your skin barrier too. Safflower Oleosomes is plant derived encapsulation technology that makes this formulation even more effective. Spray this sunscreen on your skin 15 minutes before any sun exposure. Make sure to reapply this sunscreen every 80 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone of any age who loves the sun and wants to have lightweight, long lasting and fast absorbing sun protection that also keeps your skin hydrated too. * Sun care is very important because it can help prevent skin cancer. I can't stress enough how important it is to wear sunscreen everyday. I was looking for a new everyday sunscreen and I think I found it. I prefer spray sunscreen than a cream so this one is perfect. It smells absolutely amazing and I love it! With most sunscreens they can get really heavy and greasy. I was really pleased that it absorbs really well on the skin and doesn't leave a layer of oil behind. Another thing I like is the ingredients, because I was having a hard time finding sunscreens that didn't have harsh or harmful ingredients. The Coola brand has organic and vegan ingredients so no worries about having harmful chemicals being absorbed in your body. So far so good and I would repurchase it."

The scent is also not too overpowering. * Just no * Beautiful not greasy I buy this over and over try it you won't be disappointed * This gets everywhere oily. You absolutely cannot use it inside or your floors will be slick. I still burn reapplying this too. * Wore this, let it set, and got in pool. 15 minutes later I was blue from the pools paint. This thinned it, removed it, and stuck it to my body while destroying the pools paint. * It was working okay but after 3 weeks of using it almost everday I started to develop rashes. They were circular (kinda likr cigarette burns) reddish, and flaky. They get itchy sometimes. I know it is this product because this is the only new one I've used. Now I don't know what to do with all these rashes and skin damage I've sustained. * Great hand spray type top instead of those one finger kind of press button things. The hand grippy spray allows for easier application in hard to reach areas."

It's a nice lotion that applies easy. Give it several minutes to dry down before you continue with your make up routine. It has nice broad spectrum protection. Now as I like some glow products because they add a little illumination from within Under your make up, this one was pretty glowy. I didn't need highlighter. In fact, I needed a little bit of modifying powder to tone it down a bit in areas. I didn't want that much glow. If you want to make your matte finish blush have a little more luminosity, this will give a nice base for that effect. * ive tecently started this and it is now my fvsorite prinerr is not inly primes but makes your skin glow * The fact that this has UVA and UVB protection is so huge. I wear this hiking, paddle boarding, at work, etc. and never get burnt. This sunscreen does leave a nice dew, however, you do need to caution against using too much product bc then you might look a lottle greasy and may get a little pilling. Unless they substantially change the formula, this will be a product i always make sure I have plenty of. * I have been using this for years! I love the moisture and glow it gives. * Maybe ok for oily skin but this makes my dry skin SO dry and tight. Yuck. * I have tried many face sunscreens. A lot of them would burn my sensitive skin and make my eyes water, make my skin red, or leave a white cast. This stuff does none of those things! It doesnt even feel like Im wearing sunscreen, nor does it smell like sunscreen! It gives a beautiful, radiant glow to your skin. I get compliments all the time saying ""wow your skin looks so good!"" and ""you have such a glow!"" I used to be self conscious of my uneven, reddish skin tone and would only feel confident if I was wearing foundation or BB cream. Now i have ditched those products, and feel completely confident wearing only this product out because it gives such a radiant glow (its not sparkly, either). I have almost finished the jumbo bottle and plan to buy another one when all Tula products go on sale for 25% off on Sunday, which helps because it's pricey. Highly recommend! * I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen! I first purchased it two years ago and its now a staple in my skincare routine. I used to have dry skin and now have a bit more oily skin as my skin has changed a bit and it still works wonderfully. It leaves the most beautiful glow to your skin 💛"

It's rather expensive though for what you get- considering it's a body sunscreen, this wouldn't even get you through a week at the beach. * No matter which supergoop I try they are heavy greasy they do block the sun but feel horrible * Me gusta mucho, no deja la piel grasosa, te da brillo y protege * Absolutely terrible! I broke out in a rash about an hour after using. Theew it away immediately! * I love the OG unseen sunscreen for my face and its the perfect texture and viscosity. I was hoping this would be too. I hate the lotion texture of others so i was really excited that SG came out witb this. The only problem is that its just oily… it absorbs well and makes my skin feel REALLY SOFT but since i do sweat pretty easily it can feel a bit slick at times. Maybe its the olive oil in it? Or its just too many oils. * Goes on like silk and absorbs quickly. * This is a unique sunscreen. It slides onto my skin without an oily feel and immediately disappears like water. I like working in the yard. The Unseen Sunscreen Body enables me to be outside without getting a tan or sunburn in this hot summer sun. Other brands of sunscreen have felt oily and were a bit difficult to apply without some effort. The Supergoop! spread easily. It was a delightful surprise!"

After sweating, you could see the white cast build up more and I was constantly having to rub the sunscreen in. * great sun coverage did not get burned at all after being in the sun but this is a super thick mineral sunscreen that can be hard to blend in and leaves a white cast behind. * While getting ready for a trip, failed to read the reviews. Used the sunscreen on my fair/white legs and ended up whiter than ever, embarrassed at the beach. These formulation, looks and feel like the products developed during the late 80's. I can't believe this type of formulation in 2024. * I tried to like this sunscreen but it leaves your face white, it's super thick, hard to blend in, and leaves little white dots (peels off) all over your face. * I am fair-light and this leaves an awful white cast on me. Its such a shame because the texture is really great. I've tried putting on the double amount of moisturizer I usually do, I've also tried different formulas under it but nothing works. The worst white cast which even patting and rubbing for more than ten minutes does not sink in. * I have a medium skin tone ish with neutral undertones and this makes me look grey bc of the white cast. Its also hard to blend on your face you need to massage it for awhile. Didnt feel to moisturizing either. I think ill purchase a korean sunscreen next. * Feels good on the skin and especially sensitive skin. Plus this brand has a lot of great products. But the white cast is absolutely insane. After applying to my arms, chest and face I looked like a sickly victorian child. I will probably just use this for my small children this summer so I dont waste it."

However, the tube it comes in, is a mess! The sunscreen is so thin, it really needs to come in a pump style not a squeeze style. I feel like I've lost half of the product already because it leaks out the sides. * 1. I only wear mineral spf - if you can do chemical - i wouldn't recommend this. There are so many elegant chemical formulas, especially in k-beauty! 
2. This stuff IS moisturizing and doesn't really dry down. great for dry skin or when set with powder- but i wouldn't recommend to oily girlies. 
3. Its  VERY runny- so make sure to shake it before applying. The packaging gets pretty messy for that reason - i think a dropper bottle would be perfect. 

I use this when my skin needs moisture, like after retinol or AHA. Im pretty pale and the tint is perfect. All universal tinted spfs are too orange for me. 

While i don't this daily, I really do like it and find it's been a staple for my dry or sensitive days. * this oily soup of a sunscreen should not be appearing in the ""CC cream"" or other searches for ulta. to say it's tinted is a farse, it is slightly in appearance to be non-white. it is also the oiliest, runniest cosmetic I have ever encountered. I have dry skin and couldn't even absorb it after many attempts at blending (which then eliminated any coverage it provided). the end feel was disgusting and greasy and it gave acne within 24 hours. also, the packaging doesn't seal well. in just one day it seeped out into my makeup bag. Just awful all around. * I got the medium-deep color and it is the most fantastic sunscreen I have ever found. I notice that my skin does not burn or significantly tan despite Southern summer heat, so I know it is working. Most sunscreens meant for darker skin have a much lower percentage of active ingredients and I worry I am not getting anti-aging coverage, but this one really has everything a darker skinned person could ask for. I recommend it to everyone with dark skin because not only is it an effective sunscreen, it also looks like a light foundation layer. I wear it when I have photoshoots and it looks great, my makeup artist agrees!

My only complaint is that I can no longer find it in stores like I used to, and I hope they will not discontinue it! * This sunscreen has a good shade range and is great for my dry, sensitive skin. Does not irritate my eyes or break me out, which many sunscreens do to me. * I found this on clearance & tried it over the winter. The Light shade was too light for me, in the winter, & I'm like NC 15-20 in MAC. The SPF 30 was ok for winter, but in the price range I expect SPF 50. The formula is almost greasy. I won't repurchase this & I'm really glad I didn't pay full price. * felt terrible on my skin and it brought of my imperfections"

It smells so good, isnt greasy, rubs in really well. Im not sure i would pay full price but i stock up on sale and it is worth it. * This product separated about a few days after I purchased it. No matter how much i shaked it, it was never the same again. I still got sunburnt really bad at the beach even when I was diligently reapplying a lot every 2 hours as instructed on the bottle. The scent is okay & it makes me feel greasy but because of that it does leave a nice sheen, which i like. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product. In fact, i think its very dangerous that they are advertising this as spf 50 when the sun protection didnt help me at the beach. I was surprised to find out how burnt i got because i was also hanging out in my beach tent for majority of the day. For those who have a history of skin cancer or concerned about it, i would stay away from this. * Great SPF. Vacation makes an excellent line of products. My husband puts this on everytime he goes deep sea fishing and it works. * Smells great and isnt sticky or thick, i wish the scent was a little stronger though * Works well if you don't plan on going into water. Otherwise it needs reapplied, which makes the product get used up fairly quickly. * Smells amazing and very moisturizing. The texture is slightly heavy—it dries down a bit sticky but gives a nice glossy look. I wish it was a bit lighter but love how it looks. The scent is enough make to make it worth it."

That being said, the bottle is way to small, it also says to use another spf with the product to protect your skin. Its a lovely product but for the amount you receive ans having to use another product with it, its not worth the purchase. Save your money * This product does work abaoultoey wonderul im a very pale person and rbis prsoxut has gave me rhe best tan with no burn but the bottle is really small ive only used it three times and its almost out * I bought this on a whim to try as i was desperate for any sun tanning solution and let me say this has been an unexpected winner! I used it while at a water park hoping to get my backside even and my legs to match my arms. This product has worked better then I could've ever imagined. It smells amazing, a little goes a long way, and it gets you a very nice even tan all throughout your body wherever you use it. I did go ahead and layer the product first having it as my base then a layer of sunblock and then I topped it off with another layer on top. If there was only one thing I could complain about, it would be the amount that you get for the price. While a little does go along way. I just don't know if the price offsets everything else. * The bottle is freaking tiny for 23 dollars. i shouldve looked at the ounces but the bottle just looked bigger in the picture. im not sure how good it is ive only used it once but it smells good * I don't waste my time writing reviews. But girl I need to tell you what just happened. So I am so pale, I know so sad. Okay, so I didn't want a tanning oil to give me a false tan, and ma'am when I tell YOU that I'm proud of this tan because I earned it. The oil smells so nice. I paired it with an spf 50, and I'm new to tanning and you best believe I burn easy. So when I tell you I TANNED. I feel so much better about the way I look. When I say it's only been 15 MINUTES, Jaw on the floor. Picking it up now because it is still devolving and I'm STILL getting darker. Like girl…my pasty self is getting darker? Yes…take my money agin because I'm getting another. I'm bummed I'm only getting like 7-10 uses out of it. But if it works it works. And I am working with this sun right now. Watch me be a bronze goodness by the SUMMER girl. 10/10 oil, you won't find anything better. I promise you that * I never write reviews, but i have to tell you guys everything about this. So i never bought oil before right, so i didnt know where to start. I was so afraid to burn or get a fake tan too like the other products. Oh my gosh guys, this oil works so well. It smells so good too. It doesnt give you a false tint or anything before hand and it will activally make you proud of your tan. I always hated fake reviews from insta or tiktok, but i found this one by myself and im so surprised it woked so well. Im super pale, and i never go out. The way it tanned me in one session..flabbergasted…immediately. I feel so confident. I pairded it with a spf 50, and the oil.  The oil gave me such an even and bronze tan. Its still forming curently. But this is within 15 MINUTES. Im so dispapointed the bottle is so small for the price. It will give me 7-10 sessions. But honestly its be worth it."

They really compliment my skin and I am obsessed. I feel like this really works with my skin tone. This is the first face bronzing drops that work for me. I wear this under my tinted SPF. * I was hesitant to try this because most bronzers have either been too dark or orange. This product is perfect for me. After a week at the beach, I struggle with makeup because my body is much more tan than my face. This has given me a perfect tan and glow using it on its own. As my tan fades I will try blending it with my makeup. An added benefit is the spf. In love with this product and would highly recommend * Perfect addition for my beach necessities. I am fair skinned ans it was not too dark! It has buildable coverage and it was just what I needed for sun protection! * Vacation summer must have! These bronzing drops have a serum like consistency making it super easy to blend smoothly with other serums & moisturizers. I like how this feels on my skin, it is light weight and does not leave my face feeling greasy. This pairs great under makeup or alone for a sun-kissed  glowy look while protecting your skin from harmful UVA & UVB rays! Ive been wearing it on beach and pool days and i absolutely love it! Definitely reccomend! * Vacation's Bronzing Drops offer a subtle, sun-kissed glow ideal for achieving a natural-looking tan without the harmful effects of UV exposure. 

The drops blend smoothly with moisturizers or serums, making them versatile and easy to use. The formula is lightweight, non-greasy, and enhances skin with a warm, radiant tint. 

While they deliver an impressive instant bronzing effect, the tint is temporary and requires regular application for maintenance. * This made my skin look like I had haphazardly rubbed dirt on it. And whatever is in it made my face break out in red, itchy blotches. * Hello Beauties, my name is Andrea. I am a beauty enthusiast.

I love being out in the sun, so suncare is a priority for me.

So, to find a bronzer that has skincare and suncare benefits to it is remarkable.

Vacation Studio Tone 3-in-1 Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Bronzing Drops for face is the perfect product it's not just suncare but skincare as well. It bronzes, nourishes, and protects skin from sunburn.

It gives amazing sun protection throughout the day and can even be worn in the night.

I must mention that the packaging is great. I love the dropper it is convenient and makes applying this product easy and mess free.

This bronzer applies nicely without sticky residue and is great for all skin types and skin tones.

This bronzer helps me to achieve the perfect sunkiss skin every time.

It has just the right amount of shimmer to give you that luminous glow and that satiny, dewy finish.

It can be used alone or layered under makeup without affecting my makeup application.

I absolutely recommend this product. Vacation Studio Tone is a must-have."

It also caused my make up to separate even when allowing 15 minutes to dry before applying foundation. I've increased my moisturizer usage hoping that would help offset the dryness, but it has not helped at all. This sunscreen has an odd smell to it. * I've had such a hard time finding a face sunscreen that didnt mess with my skin or makeup and this is it! I'm obsessed with how easy it is to apply after my skincare and it was no issue at all with my makeup after application! It doesn't have a typical sunscreen smell. I will say, for someone like myself who had oily combo skin, this might be a hit or miss for you, but for myself personally I didn't mind it at all :) * My sister-in-law got this and I've always wanted to try it and have it my own and I love it 😊 * Smells terrible and goes on like flaky paste. Overall gross feeling. Very dissatisfied. * I've tried countless sunblocks, most of which caused me breakouts and I usually hate the way they feel on my skin or smell. This one is my GOAT. It layers well over my other skincare and makes a great primer for makeup. I always repurchase this. * I've lived an active outdoorsy lifestyle for many years and I have tried many sunblocks. I bought this on a whim and I'm so glad that I did! I use it everyday either on its own or under my makeup. I have light, sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. This product blends well over my other skincare and doesn't feel heavy. Its also beautiful under makeup. I'll keep repurchasing. * Took me a bit to get used to this product esp after using city block spf 40, but is now a staple in my everyday morning routine. It blends really nice into the skin after warming the product up with my fingertips. Thats the key is warming the prodcut up in your hands. I love how it has just a little tint to bring down redness; with a little concealer and transparency powder on top, it creates a beautiful finish!"

It's light and I wear it as my foundation so I know I have coverage all day. * This is the best tinted sunscreen ever.   Application is key because you have to shake the tube before use.  The product has a great ability to spread on the skin, so a little product goes a very long way.  I bought two colors so I put a very tiny, tiny amount in the lighter shade.   I do blend the sunscreen very well because the consistency lends itself to a great blend.  My skin responds well to the product. No pilling, great coverage, and adds the hint of tint that warms my skin up.  If anyone complains about the price I feel like they are using too much.  A small amount goes a long way. * Dry skin, add .25 tret, cera/chol/efa moisturizer and still my fave kinship not moisturizing enough, but kin sport now too greasy on top of all that. Tried a few 'cone-free k options, still no. This is the one. Negs: price & the little detached cap. So far only used in 50% humidity so will see how it goes in the NE US summer. * I don't love this product. I'm not a huge makeup wearer but love DE bronzi drops mixed with moisturizer. Before I bought this, I was mixing bronzi drops with the elf sunscreen dupe of supergoop. This product just feels heavy on my face  and doesnt rub in that well. I use mineral sunscreen on my face at the beach but this just feels sticky and heavy. Will be sticking to mixing the bronzi drops with my elf sunscreen rather than using this product. * this is a great sunscreen for sensitive skin. lasts on the skin for a long time even with sweating and offers great protection. the tinted sunscreen blends in nicely and doesn't leave a white cast at all. gifted by drunk elephant. * Drunk Elephant Umbra Tinted Sunscreen is a decent mineral sunscreen. It offers good protection and a subtle tint that evens out my skin tone. However, I find it a bit greasy for my combination skin, especially in humid weather. The price point is also on the higher side. Overall, it's a good option if you're looking for a mineral sunscreen with a slight tint, but there are other similar products on the market that might be better suited for oily skin.

However it is invisible which is a plus. * I tried this off and on for about a month and i love the texture of it and how it applies and it does hydrate for a little bit but after a few hours my face would be dry.

I now look like a tomato and have sun poisoning. Don't waste your money * I used this sunscreen recently at an amusement park and it was 90s the whole time. Good news is that I didn't get burnt but I felt sticky the whole day. It was pretty uncomfortable. I would buy again if there was a dry touch option. * Unfortuately this product pilled a lot and was not sweat resitant for me. Dissappinted :( * As a ginger, sunscreen is very important to me. After using a bunch of different spf 50s on my trip, this has stayed #1! The smell is amazing, the spray is very powerful and only needs a little bit since it goes such a long way, and it leaves a nice glow without too much oil! I heavily recommend this spf! * perfect sunscreen for wandering the city, hiking, just sitting outside, not greasy which is so major, smells unique in a good way * DON'T BUY!! Does NOT work!!!! Went camping and had the family use this spf and we all ended up burnt! I take sunscreen very seriously and this the first time with any that hasn't worked! Not worth it!! * I don't know what was in this sunscreen, but I was really looking forward to a convenient spray SPF. I put it on my forearms and neck in late morning and was put off by the scent, but brushed it off. Later that night, I noticed small, red pinpricks all over my arms. I woke up the next morning and the dots had become red bumps, and were noticeable over my neck, looking similar to acne. As of now, about 36 hours later, my arms are still covered in bumps, though they are no longer red. I have no known allergies, so I don't know what caused this reaction. All this to say, I have not enjoyed this experience, and the scent is unpleasant anyways."

Just make sure it doesnt get in your eyes. * My only critique is that the packaging itself is fairly small, meaning not as much product as i predicted. But it works well nonetheless. * This product is cute, works well and smells good. The size of the container was as expected and makes it super portable, but the amount of product was disappointing. I probably wouldn't have even realized how little product there was in the tube, but when I first opened the tube the product fell out exposing how much was really in there. I'm talking about a half an inch worth of product in the 3.5 inch tall tube… The packaging clearly says 0.7 oz, but you don't realize how little that is. * found this and said oh perfect! needed something to keep in my bag for sunscreen on long motorcycle trips. this is a great size teardrop shaped stick that goes on smooth and clear, smells really nice and light. definitely would recommend this to everyone! packaging is also on point ☝🏻 * The only way I will be applying SPF from now on! This sunscreen stick is pocket size, put it in your purse, beach bag… & your good to go. I love the way it feels on my skin, giving me a natural looking glow. Absolutely no white cast, as this goes on clear. I definitely reccomend! * The Vacations Sunscreen Stick is fantastic! It's compact and easy to carry, making reapplication throughout the day a breeze. 

The formula is smooth, non-greasy, and provides excellent sun protection. Plus, it has a pleasant scent and doesn't leave a white cast. Perfect for on-the-go sun care! * I'm absolutely in love with the Vacation Super Stick SPF 45! The edgy shape ensures precise application, and it makes my skin feels very silky smooth. It goes on clear with a beautiful satin finish that felt perfect under my makeup. As someone with oily skin, I appreciate that it doesn't cause any breakouts or extra oiliness to my skin.

Unlike most white mineral sunscreens, this one actually soaks in & leaves no cast on your skin. It also feels super moisturizing and keeps you from burning! * Just bought this to tan. A lot of other sunscreens will still have me leaving (slightly) burnt no matter how many times I re-apply even if its before the recommend time. But with this sunscreen, i tanned out in the sun (under the amount of time before i needed to re-apply) and i didnt burn even a little!!! Very effective and works well, but it really does leave a bad white cast which is the downside because the white cast is very noticeable and doesn't blend away. I also find this sunscreen to be very greasy compared to other's but it doesn't bother me as much as the white cast does. * It's so oily and leaves a huge white cast. It's terrible. * Went on a trip to Hawaii and needed a reef safe sunscreen. Use this before on my face and I will say it was too greasy. However, this time I used it on my body and it was perfect. Would definitely use again in the future for body * This is the greasiest sunscreen I've ever used.  I hate it so much.  My skin stayed greasy for over an hour after applying.  This stuff is an oil slick. * This gives me a white cast at first but blends in quickly. Leaves a slight greasy feel but tolerable. This doesn't break me out or irritate my skin at all which is great. I like that it's reef safe and has a cool color-changing cap."

It rubs into the skin so easily. It does not pill or leave a white cast. Its very moisturizing as well. It gives your skin a subtle glow. It does not overly burn your eyes either if some gets into them. It lays great under makeup. I spent a week in Florida and i used this daily and my face/ neck DID NOT BURN.
I love this product! * I wanted to test out a few different SPF's with vitamin C. This product by far has the best feel and moisturization without being too heavy or oily. I hate the smell of sunscreen and this smell was very potent in this product. If it was not for the smell, it would be my go to but instead I went for Muad Environmental Shield SPF 50. This product is a little more oily, but smells so much better! * I got sample size of the sunscreen and I'm almost finished just ordered full size❤️❤️❤️love the texture blend easily and no whitecast * I wanted to love this so bad, but couldn't do it after using it for a few weeks. I have oily skin and this just added even more to it. I loved the texture of it, but after applying it felt too heavy on my skin. This also has your typical sunscreen smell to it which is not horrible, but could potentially push people away. I kept going back to my EltaMD UV clear as it leaves a matte finish for me. I'm sure Kiehls would be great for people with dry skin! * I will forvere use this product. The serum texture makes it an amaing last skincare step. In love is an understatement. * Im a MUA of 20+ yrs. This is the first and best not only spf that doesnt leave a cast EVER but isnt thick or cloges pores, and forget about it being sunscreen it's ACTUAL SKINCARE!! Where has this been all my life, Im on my 2nd bottle and not only that but I broke my ankle and didnt use for 1 week and I had wrinkles on my forehead I never knew I had, started using it again religiously and I mean every time I'm outside every two hours like you're supposed to with SPF. And with the collogen and other delicious stuff afteIm 41 and look you ger than my 35 year old hus and and those lines are GONE AGAIN. How are there only 8 revies on this!! I get it its very exspensive for a ""sunscreen"" but if your not using 50 on  your face every 2 hours outside sun/shade your damaging your skin and it was only when I found this that I saw the significant difference. I have hyper sensitive skin and hated using SPF's before esp in combo with any skin care because it just never felt right on my face or had any benefits so always did both seperate. Never again!! I dont work or have affiliation with the brand or product it's just that amazing and I have to tell you it is worth every little penny please don't let the price tag scare you because what it will give you back will save you all the injectables. You do all the facials that you get it is truly mind blowing. I will never go without this and make sure I have an extra bottle before I run low. This is how I think…. Whats your skin/ youth looking face worth to you and too try it for free for 60 days and see the results or get your $$ back why wouldnt you!!! * Lightweight face sunscreen that doesn't leave a sticky, greasy, or opaque residue. Skin feels soft and nourished. After two wears, I feel like this will be a staple. Reasonable price is the icing on the cake."

The nozzle stopped working almost immediately, I didn't even get one leg fully covered before it clogged up.  Luckily I had a backup lotion with me. Other Blue Lizard products have been great. * I would say this product is a firm no for me as I PERSONALLY experienced a minor allergic reaction on my arms and it made them really itchy with small bumps. I had high hopes it would work fantastically as it's mineral with high spf but it's unfortunately a no for me :( * I love Blue Lizard's other products, but the spray nozzle stopped working only after a couple of sprays. * Sirays on so easy. Applies with minimal effort to rub in after spraying on. Has the most mild scent out if all the products, probably due to the application process. It wirks so well. Full day of baseball camp, and my son had zero burns at all. Just a beautiful tan. Highly recommened this product. * I bought this for a trip to Maui with my husband. The bottle looks to be a decent size - a little smaller than your average spray sunscreen container. The product itself worked well. There was a slight white cast but it wasn't bad. It felt like it was stuck to our skin (in a good way) and definitely protected us from the sun. HOWEVER... The bottle literally lasted  us 2 applications each, so 4 full body applications total! And we are relatively small people. Is this a joke?? Good thing that was all we needed for our trip, but that's DEFINITELY not worth the money. Such a bummer!"

I have used it on my face  over cruelty-free spf30 moisturizer, my arms, & legs.  It has a pleasant vanilla smell & uses tumeric & other gentle ingredients.  I was disappointed in the expiration date, however, & returned it.  Will order another one online to hopefully get a better exp. date.  I recommend it highly! * I love this sunscreen! It is one of the only ones I've tried that doesn't break me out. I have normal, but dehydrated skin that is fairly sensitive and acne prone. The zinc oxide in this sunscreen really helps calm redness and irritation in my skin and is somewhat hydrating whereas some sunscreens I've tried for acne prone skin were too drying for me. I used this for years and decided to try other sunscreens, but I ended up coming back to this one as others i tried just didnt compare. * It leaves a dewy sheen, has a pleasant smell, and did not break me out. For me, it was just too thick feeling on my skin, so I will be returning. But, I really do get why it's popular. * I have been using this sunscreen for a while (probably almost 2 years). I do mix in a little bit of tinted sunscreen from another brand, but can wear this on its own. The best things about this sunscreen are that it wears well under makeup and it provides amazing protection. My make up lasts just as long with this underneath, and does not change the finish. Sometimes I feel like it makes it look better. 

The protection on this is phenomenal. I went to an all day concert this weekend, and used this with my holy grail foundation that lasts through almost anything and for over 15 hours. I forgot to put sunscreen on my arms for the first hour, and got a little red even though I put sunscreen on pretty early. However, my face was not burned AT ALL, and I was in the sun a lot. 

I dont usually wear this one on its own, I usually wear a more tinted one if I am not wearing makeup, but this is my favorite sunscreen under make up, hands down, and the highest % protection out of any of my other sunscreens. Highly recommend! * I have been trying so many different sunscreens and so many i havent liked. The kinship is amazing and its great for dry skin. Works well with the vitimin C serum im uaong. I will definitely repurchase * I have tried so many sunscreens for the face. A lot of them are nice, but eventually break me out. The ones that don't make my eyes water, and make me look very oily. This sunscreen looks very nice on the face. It evens out my skin tone a bit, and moisturizes. It can be a little tacky, but the finish looks so nice, I don't mind. Some days I use a light hand and dust some setting powder over top. This gives a nice glow, while letting your natural skin tone shine through. Definitely give us a try. * This is my holy grail.  22.4% NON-NANO zinc and NO butyloctyl salicylate?  Amazing.  I have very sensitive skin, and the light vanilla fragrance doesn't bother my skin, but watch out for that if you are sensitive to fragrance."

For reference im a nc35, oily/acne prone. I was looking for something somewhat similar to SkinBetter compact spf. This does the job. It doesnt break me out, I also been wearing this on the go instead of a foundation its medium to full  coverage. It doesnt have any smell imo. The beige shade is touch light and a touch on the pink side. But once i put bronzer and blush it evens out. This makes my skin look airbursh too every time i had wore this people compliment me on my skin which is nice!  The only reason its not a 5⭐️ is the lack of shades. * This is my holy grail foundation over pimple, its a natural finish with some medium coverage and the light shade my perfedr summer shade.

Has protection and makes you glow. I always get compliments on my skin when I wear it * I love this product. You need very little. But, my skin looks amazing with it. * I wore this a few times without a problem but got a bad rash on my forehead today. I had no other products on my face so it had to be this. It was very hot today so maybe the product causes rash at certain temps? Others have also experienced this rash based on the reviews and I never have had a reaction like this to another sunscreen or facial product in general. I would avoid this product * I like the product, but it leaves a white cast after applying. I don't think l will order this again. * I wanted to love this serum for multiple reasons. The idea of a glowy sunscreen that I could wear instead of regular sunscreen to give an extra glow for makeup was great. Reality not so much. I felt like when it went on it was so glowy that it just highlighted my pores? Also not positive but pretty sure this makes my skin breakout. I dont vary in my skincare but when I do to wear this…I break out. So maybe it is just a fault with my skin reacting * I wear sunscreen daily, even if I dont think I'm going to be in the sun so I've tried dozens. This is by far my favorite. It's amazing under makeup and I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear this that I've even started using it before my makeup at night! * Used this for awhile with no concerns, then started experiencing unexplained facial swelling & rashes. Spent $500+ at my doctor only to figure out on my own it's this product and now that I have read other reviews I see I'm not alone."

I broguht it on my honeymoon with me two years ago, and I can still bring back the taste in my memory.   As I sweat, this transferred EVERYWHERE.   In my eyes (I didn't even use it on my face),  onto my drink straws (everything tasted like this sunscreen when I wore it.). I also had to get rid of a cover up because the oil residue transferred and stained it.   I was so disappointed because I usually love this brand. * I was really excited about this product. I applied generously and every 40 minutes like the directions. No water or anything. I am absolutely fried. I know oil attracts sun but i thought a 50 SPF product would do something. Extremely disappointing with how expensive. I do like the face product! Although now weary of its potentcy. Have not found out as i keep my face shielded anyways. * This product smells amazing and I'm sure does great on the sunscreen portion but as for the ""glow"" or ""iridescence"" this product just leaves your skin looking greasy. There is no simmer or sparkle to it. * This product worked well for me. I am white like casper and i usually turn red in the sun. I appiled a good amount and my tan was so nice. I cleaned my hands on my legs and i could see my finger marks lol i only appiled twice while out in the sun. Smells great too! * Im pretty sure there is no spf in this… I reapplied generously and only the areas that i used this got absolutely fried! Where as a different brand of 30 spf protected me with zero sunburn in other areas! Sad because this was so expensive :( * This is not sunblock. This js a greasy body oil that does not absorb into the skin * This is a very oily product that feels greasy after applying. It doesn't shimmer at all like it says to be. I used this on my 3 day beach trip and ended up super sunburnt! Seems like the spf didn't work at all and I'm really sad because this is so expensive. The only good thing about it is the smell. Other than that, it's overpriced and leaves you with no sun protection."

I used this while paddle boarding on the lake in my bikini all day in 100° temps. I reapplied once mid day and no sunburn! I use self tanner but this was my first big day in the hot summer sun. * I love Coola sunscreen. The spray applies well. I bought the travel size since I was going on vacation and only bringing a carry on and the regular size would be too big. I was a tad disappointed that these did not last the entire week. My husband and I were the only ones using the spray and we brought 2 new travel bottles with us, but they only made it to about 2/3 of the vacation. It would be nice if there was a TSA approved size that could go a little further. Besides that though, it had a good application that lasted well and as always, I love the scent. * Its an anazing product. Snells anazing, and definitely fets the job done. My only negative is that its a chemical sunscreen. Great for occational use, but not a daily summer sunscreen bc of that. * My husband and I had the worst experience with this product today, so I ran to the reviews to see if others had a problem with it. Sure enough, others mentioned that they burned badly & quickly when using this product. We spent 1 hour in overcast weather, me wearing a long sleeve hoodie, before the sun came out and we decided to wear our T shirts and SPF. We were super confused when very shortly afterwards, we were BURNED!! This wasn't the most intense sun either. I tried to protect myself & my husband with this product and it caused more harm than good. 0/10, don't even risk it. * I used this sunscreen at the beach and didnt get sunburnt at all! I have very sensitive skin and burn very badly. It was easy to apply, not greasy, and fragrance free. My only reason for giving 4 stars is the price and if you go in the water it'll wash off immediately. But I would still buy it again for another beach trip! * The smell was so strong. It smelled extremely fake, like a chemical. I couldn't try it in the store, so I tried it when I got home and returned it the next day. 
It is not something to buy because it is easy to apply. * I just bought a bottle one month ago and it's empty. I dont over spray and maybe use it every weekend. it costs to mucj to go through it so fast."

Effective, no odor, smooth and non greasy * Bought this based off of the reviews here and I am so glad I did. I was looking for a sunscreen specifically for face. This was exactly what i was looking for. It's clear, not sticky, glides on smoothly, conveniently sized. I need something to quickly put on before running out the door and this makes it easy to apply all over the face and neck area. I havent used this under makeuo yet but i am sure it wouldnt be an issue since there is no residue it leaves on the skin, it is truly smooth and feels like nothing is on. The only possible con for some might be that there is a slight fragrance. It is a VERY subtle fragrance, it reminds me of Softsoap handsoap, but it does not linger by any means. It's more like once you apply it its there but vanishes within a min maybe less? It didnt cause any irritation whatsoever. * I bought this to take on a trip and i could definitely see the difference between spots that I used the stick vs missed spots. Doesn't feel greasy and I love how easy it is to carry in my purse so I can reapply more frequently. * Bought this to try a stick cause since typical cream sunscreen always ends up in my eye I sweat and causes my eyes to sting. Used it for the first time on a lake day and only applied once - my face and neck were the only two body parts that left without sunburn. It's now my go to for everyday use, glides on super smooty, doesnt leave a film, and doesnt feel heavy on your face. Okay Im done rambling now, just go buy it. * I have sensitive skin and combination oily/dry skin. Tried this sunscreen for a couple months. I started to break out with big and painful acne which I hadn't had for many years. Would not recommend for acne prone skin. * I do not have sensitive skin, mostly normal sometimes a little dry depending on season. I was excited to try this sunscreen stick since it's very popular. It leaves the skin super shiny, and it broke me out so much. It really clogged my pores. * It's expensive and worth every penny. 

I have very fair skin and never got a burn while using this. It doesn't melt in the heat and has no overpowering fake smell. 

I've recommended this to so many people and have them hooked as well. The moment they try mine they're blown away by how it doesn't feel like a typical sunscreen."

It is lightweight and organic. * COOLA is one of my favorite brands so when I saw they had a 70 SPF I haf to try it. And it is now a constant staple i have. The smell is also nice not too fragramt  and not the typical sunscreen amell * I used this on just myself maybe 4 times and it was gone. For how expensive this is you do NOT get enough product. * Used this on my trip that had almost zero shade and in the pool. Kept me protected in the water and outside the water. No weird smell, It does leave a slight tint on the skin, just looks like a tan. Would 100% buy again * I really like this formula. It covers well and it's fragrant but not too heavy or greasy. It did pretty well in the water too. * I don't get much sun exposure because I like to stay indoors mostly, BUT I use this still to keep my skin young! Doesn't at all leave a greasy or sticky residue and rubs in really easily! I will say careful when spraying if you have tile or wood floors cause it'll be slippery at first but it honestly dries up pretty quickly"

I probably would have just continued using it despite the white cast because most everything els eahout it is amazing however my skin was clear and then consequently broke out after a week of using. This product is most wverything i want in a sinscreen, easy to blend, leaves you glowy, and is hydrating, while its difficult to know exactly what broke me out, ive had simular issues in the past with ceraveas sunscreens so im pretty sure thats the culprate. Its also not very high spf so maybe i wasnt applying often enough but it left me still burnt HOWEVER after applying it it will leave you looking like you havent seen the sunlight a day in your life because the white cast is so bad you just look pale. I wouldnt say dont buy this product bc theres lots of pros to it that i havent found in other sunscreens yet so honestly its a win loose with this product you just gotta pick your poison. * I figured I'd try their sunscreen since Cerave is amazing for my skin in general, but their suncare line is not for everyone. It didnt blend seemlessly as the bottle advertised, and instead I looked like unfinished pottery. * I have bought SO MANY sunscreens and hope that they don't leave a white cast. As someone with colored skin I have struggled hard with finding a sunscreen that doesn't take forever to rub in or leave a whitecast. This is probably one of the best ones I have tried! It's also easy to rub on kiddo's too, especially their face. * Product was as described.  Sheer, blended in smoothly. * Tried this on recommendation. Ugh. Leaves a white cast and is basically pointless in blocking the sun. Burned the first time using it. I had been using La Roche Posay and it had prevented burns, but this did nothing to prevent the sun. All the work I've done on my skin over the winter is now for naught. * This is my all time favorite sunscreen it is my go to last step of my morning skincare rountine. I worked with all my makeup products with making my skin feel heavy. Very hydrating i use it on my face neck and tattoos. I have very sensitive combo skin w rosacea and this product works great for me! * I was introduced to this specific sunscreen because I received some small samples. They convinced me to buy the full sized bottle! Its lightweight and melts into the skin quickly. Even my husband noticed how it didnt leave a white cast on him and appreciated how moisturizing the sunscreen is. We even apply it to our faces without issue. I think this will be our go-to sunscreen from now on!"

Despite being 48, I have very good skin and I don't need much coverage if any so this formula is perfect for me. Goes on well and feels nice on the skin. Very natural but dewy finish without the stickiness. Will reorder! * I really love this sunscreen. Its a very sheer tint but perfect alone or under make up. It doesnt have a scent and dries down almost matte. Not oily at all. I got shade 2 and it lools very dark for me but blended in great! It also doesnt burn my eyes! A little pricey but worth it. I have senstive acne prone skin and have had no issues! I will probably buy shade one in the winter when im super pale but shade two is perfect with a tan * I love dime perfume so I thought I'd try their skin care. 
This looks terrible on dry skin. It cakes and flakes.
I have very light skin, but the lightest tint is basically white and looks so bad. 

Please save your money. * I really wanted to love this product. It was too dark for me and I got the medium shade and I have olive skin although it did make my skin feeling soft it was way too oily for me from the initial put on. * I have used this tinted sunscreen for 1.5-2 years and havent used anything else . I constantly re-buy this in shade 2 . If you used the original before shades 1-3 , shade 2 is the original ! I use it as my base before make up and use it on its own daily for work . Layers well and keeps my skin supple and glowy . I have never re-purchased a product like i have this one before . Highly recommend ! My skin type is dry/normal * I absolutely love this sunscreen. It goes on smoothly and improves skin texture. Great sun protection. LOVE that the ingredients are so clean! * Theres better"

The first time I put it on I just figured like oh it will go away, false. I smelled popcorn all day. Weird complaint, I know. Im sensitive to smells so I will not be using this anymore but while I did wear it the product was amazing. * Reapply to my face multiple times but my face still burns (more than if i use a different sunscreen) and makes my entire face peel, leaves a white cast * I cannot stress enough how much I don't like this product. It pills on my skin and separates so badly, it's in chunks when I try to get product out, which is pretty gross. I had higher expectations for good molecules, but they disappointed me with this one. * It kept peeling all over my skin and had to wash my face again * Its unscented, natural satin/matte finish, and lightweight. It's almost perfect! The only con is that it is not sweat proof and I have had it run into my eyes on days where I am sweating more. * Like many other reviewers the same thing happened to me. This deserves negative stars and ruined my skin for a year and a half now. I've been battling flares and opened my skin up to other sensitivities. This product is horrible and check the photo turned my entire neck red, dark, itchy. Even when the itch went away left me with SUCH BAD PIGMENT all around my eyes and mouth/chin that I've now been battling for over a year. DO NOT GET * It's a very runny texture and it goes on super light and it doesn't have any scent and it's not sticky. However, the packaging is poor. Since it's runny, they should made the whole smaller or use a different method. I do not need this to drip all over my top every time I use it. Without any effort, it squirts out of the bottle. For that reason, I won't purchase again."

We all applied spf at the same time, unfortunately we all forgot/neglected to reapply and we all went swimming in a lake. I am so shocked that i am not a lobster because everyone else is RED today and I'm usually the first person to burn as i am naturally very pale.

I am very happy with the results and definitely recommend it for when you're ouf in swimwear to have a nice glow. 

HOWEVER, it is greasy just so you know. But it still gets 5 stars because it works so well * I was excited to purchase this product since i have used orher products from this brand, however this one is the WORST! I have used it on a few seperate ocasions and each time i burned so badly! I reapplied constantly and there were a fee times i used it and never got wet; and yet it still didn't work! I agree with other poor reviews and also believe the oil amplified the burn. So dissapointed because i wanted to love it, but it does the opposite of protecting your skin despite having a SPF 50 protection claim. * The first few words on the back of this bottle are ""clean chemical sunscreen actives"" but this isnt a clean product if that's what you're looking for.

7 of the main ingredients come up as hazardous or harmful when it's scanned into the Yuka app. Octocrylene is an endocrine disruptor and once broken down it becomes carcinogenic, studies have found. Just an FYI this isnt exactly ""clean"".

It's also a bit greasy, you'll need to wash your hands after using it before toughing your hair or face. * Because the oil lays on thick, I think it takes a long time for it to settle in the skin, so it's easy to come off. I kept reapplying, but whenever I would switch sides tanning, I felt my skin burning. The oil probably rubbed off on my towel, and I ended up burnt. I should have gone with a spray since I think it absorbs in the skin faster since it's a lighter coat so to speak.

It seems to be that you can't sit or lay down for 20 minutes while it's being absorbed since it's really easy for it to come off. * I applied and reapplied and reapplied and i am so burnt after being at the beach for jusr a few hours that you would think I never applied any sunblock at all. My skin hurts and is radiating heat. My friend and i both feel like the oil was amplifying the sun rather than blocking it. She isnt red because she has more naturally occurring melanin than i do, but her skin is painful and tight as well. I wanted to love it like i do the rest of their products I've tried, but instead I'll be going back to normal sunblock. * I was so happy I found an oil with spf as I usually use coco oil but wanted something with better protection for vacation. I wore this for hours bathing in the sun and didnt burn one bit. HOWEVER, my skin erupted in tiny little bumps all over. My body skin is not sensitive and I was extremely surprised and disappointed since Supergoop is so well trusted. It took days to have the bumps go away and in certain areas i can still feel them and its been over a week. Would not recommend as it is highly irritating. * as a person who uses body oil over body lotion daily, and who has consistent problems with product pilling, I love this.  It sits on top of my other skincare without interacting.  it's a little pricey but worth it, since I cannot seem to find a similar product made by a drugstore brand.  if there was, I would buy it.

I don't use it on my face because facial oil makes my glasses fall off, but I don't see why you couldn't"

The smell is subtle and i wish they made a bigger jar! * I really like the entire Vacation line that I have tried. A little goes a long way with this oil and the SPF is perfect. I never get burned when I use it. It smells great too. * Tried it and it doesnt work, maybe for a short period of time but i wore it on a float trip and it didnt do any protecting, i reapplied multiple times but if its not water resistant being an oil whats the point in it. I guess use it if you just wanna lay out maybe but i wouldnt but again * I got this as a gift with purchse of their Classic Whip sunscreen. Wow, the smell of this is so nice! It definitely has a baby smell, so if you're not looking for that typical coconut, pineapple, etc this may be for you. It reminds me of the classic Love's Baby Soft fragrance from the 80's. This entire brand seems to capture these throwback products really well! Kudos for that! I wish there was a larger size option, but I'll definitely purchase a full size bottle. * Be sure to look at the fluid ounces before buying.  This is about the size of a cell phone.  I was expecting at least a standard size bottle. I feel stupid.  Smells good but not a good value. I've not used in sun yet.  Gotta save for a special occasion since it will last a whole 3 minutes. * I was hoping this would smell like the Vacation perfume but it smells like 1975 baby powder.  So strongly!! Amd the bottle is horribly leaky.  I picked up curbside from the store and by the time i was home the inside of the bag was so greasy. * obsessed with the packaging and smell of this one! and im so glad it includes good spf unlike actual baby oil. only taking 1 star off because the bottle leaks like crazy so if you travel you can lose quite a bit of it…"

However, I cannot put it anywhere above my lower eyeline. It always runs into my eyes even if I appy it above my eyebrows, so I must use a different non-running sunscreen around eyes and on forehead and temples. It leaves a shiney finish on my oily skin which I like. It would be perfect if it did not get in my eyes. I also must shake it vigorously each time because it separates after not being used for a month. I wish it did not run into my eyes. Maybe powdering would stop it if you like to use face powder. * I haave tried so many facial
Sunscreens shd this is my go to!
Great under makeup and my dry skin feels soft all day. * I wish I had read more comments before buying because they are all correct…this stuff will burn your eyes even when you do not put it anywhere near your eyes. AND hours upon hours after applying. Honestly, I am flabbergasted at why this is but it is. Do not buy. * I love this sunscreen if im careful about not applying too close to my eyes. It sits nicely on the face and doesnt look too oily. I use a light layer of pressed powder in my t zone on top of this to combat the oil and it works pretty well. Just be super careful around the eyes, ive never had such intense burning pain in my eyes as i did when some of this accidentally got on my eyelids * it says serum sunscreen which makes you think it would be thin but its lotion textured it feels great on the skin like velvet, but the eye burn is to bad even when I don't apply near my eyes it still burns so many others that don't burn for less money 5/10 * I so wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this! I did not but it to use under makeup but there's no way I could. Using 2 fingers; the amount recommended by dermatologists, my face was GREASY!! Also burned my eyes, as many others have stated. 
I' plan to return it. I can't see! It coats your eyes! * I frequently use neutrogena products and almost exclusivly use thier sun protection products. However, when i tried this i had an AWFUL reaction. It had such an intense reaction with my eyes, they were hurting and red for over a week after using this product once. When a friend had the same reaction, i looked into it, and this product is known to cause this reaction. Do not purchace. 

I will continue to buy and use the other Neuterogena Sunscreens - just never this one."

But I don't know how effective the color correction is. It is hard to tell if the minimal correction is from the green color or the white cast (which I don't mind. I've certainly seen worse white casts) Also, I don't like how it smells. I don't know how to describe the scent, but it's nothing terrible just a little off-putting.
Not sure yet if I'll repurchase it when I'm done. * I've been on the hunt for a sunscreen that doesn't irritate my eyes and this has been the only thing that has worked. * I bought it since I really like most of their products. This offers great sun protection as I usually get burned early on in the summer but did not this year. However, my sensitive skin is really triggered by it. I got horrible breakouts for the first two weeks that left scarring. It also made me get eczema breakouts around my nose and I have never gotten eczema on my face before, only around my arms. If you don't have sensitive skin, go for it. I won't be buying this again."

I will definitely be buying again. * I am southeast Asian with a light-medium skintone. This tinted sunscreen blended in beautifully and I was so impressed that it wasn't as greasy as other tinted sunscreens I've tried in the past, nor did it dry down to a pastey finish. I can see this not working for darker complexions but fortunately it worked for my skin tone. * I have semi-sensitive skin (can use many mainstream items if they don't have heavy fragrance) and fair skin: this product was a decent color match and i love how quickly it blends, but after many weeks or trialling it, i can confirm the skin does get to feeling a slight burning sensation (not painful like an allergic reaction, but uncomfortable like you can feel your skin just existing) when sweating (just BARELY sweating) and/or in direct sun or heat. if you're sweating AND out in the sun — kiss your face goodbye, as it became such a strange feeling. * I really REALLY love this sunscreen. It's the only one I've found works well with my skin tone. And it doesn't feel too greasy or too dry, just right. * Really impressed with the formula. Lightweight and moisturizing. I break out with chemical sunscreens including korean. I tolerate most mineral sunscreens even though they are drying or super greasy. This wears like a chemical sunscren (thin and hydrating) but does not break me out. I hope they never discontinue this formuala. Best sunscreen ive ever tried (and I've tried dozens). * I would say if you are light skinned that's able to tan or you are natural tan this will work but anything lighter or darker than this will not work. You have to do 2 thin layers with this. Honestly this works as well as some 40 dollar ones I tried. * This has Phenoxyethanol. If you want to get pregnant dont use anything with this chemical. It cause alot of health issues. No reason to have this . Shame on Bubble! Also they only use 12% zinc it should be 15% at least gor a true 30 spf."

You can use it anywhere, and even on the face it doesnt break me out. It smells nice and is so easy to toss in a bag and reapply as needed. The glitter is something I dont mind, but my bf is not a fan! If they came out with a shimmer/clear version, it would appeal to a lot of people! Overall it lasts for a long while and I will repurchase. * This is a pretty product, but the large glitter chunks are just not for me at all. If you want people to be able to see visible glitter flakes on your body, you might like this. Maybe good for a festival or something.

I prefer a more pearly glow like the liquid version of this product. I would never use this on the face. It does glide on really nicely though. * Great spf for travel or beach/pool days. Leaves skin dewy and sparkly and absorbs pretty well and has a nice scent… So, listen to the reviews! It does has large chunks of glitter flakes. It will be noticeable on the skin. However, I've been using this for the past few days on my face and I like it. Be careful applying to close to the eye area because it can burn… Has a nice light tropical scent. * This stuff is so pretty on the skin and effective! This is part of my daily routine. I put it on mu chest / arms and its very comfortable and long lasting. I wore it out in the pool for 2+ hours (im very very fair skinned) and i did not burn. This product gives me the perfect glow. Due to the heavy oils and glitter, i would not put this on my face, but it's beautiful elsewhere. * not greasy, not too glowy, feels lightweight, overall great product! but that glitter is pretty big AND it sticks a lot - even after a shower it was still there, so just be aware if that bothers you! * I use this as a cute little add on after my thicker SPF creams. The glitter adds a cute glow and its perfect for reapplying throughout the day. * I saw this originally on Kopari's page and was SO excited to try it! It truly is the perfect on-go must have! I love that it keeps my skin protected with the right amount of subtle glow. I am taking this everywhere with me!"

It blends in so well without feeling sticky or gross. Blends in completely clear. And NO SMELL. this is my new go to daily body sunscreen, im so happy i found it. * I had high hopes. But it left a weird film on my skin and rub off in clumps. Even after re-applying several times I still got severely sunburnt. * I was hesitant to try this because of some of the negative reviews, especially the reviews that mention a bad smell; however, I'm happy to report that mine has ZERO smell. It has a fairly lightweight consistency and blends onto the skin seamlessly. There is a slight tacky feel, and I noticed that when I rested my elbows on surfaces in my car, a grease spot was left behind - this is the reason I took off 1 star. Yet overall, this is a nice product that I'd definitely recommend. I also appreciate the fact that it's free of coconut oil! * This is my go-to for my tattoos and I've been using it for about 3 or 4 years now. There is no white cast, and it makes my tattoos (all black and gray) pop! I can truly attest to the sun protection, as once I missed a spot and could see a very clear, visible pink patch with a hard line differentiating from where the protection was! I also use this on my daughter who has sensitive skin and eczema, and it seems to be going okay. 

Fragrance-free means no added frangrance—so it smells like a natural sunscreen, which I don't mind. But I see some people complaining about that…

If you're looking for excellent sun protection, especially for tattoos, I HIGHLY recommend this product! * Dries quickly and invisible on skin. Leaves a somewhat velvety texture, but feels very light and not sticky. Good amount of product for the price. I had high hopes due to positive reviews about no cast and fragrance-free (I'm very sensitive to scents). I have to wear/reapply sunscreen a lot for medical reasons, so I'm very picky and this one checks almost every box. 

However, it has a horrible chemical-y smell, sort of like plastic? I actually thought it was just from the container and would disappear after drying, but even hours later, I could still smell it on my skin. It's not super strong, but I wear sunscreen on legs, arms and face and reapply frequently, so it's noticeable.

I'll try to use it up because it's so pricey, but definitely will not be repurchasing. Really disappointing because it's wonderful otherwise! Probably good for a beach day, sports, etc. Just not for everyday. * I wanted an everyday spf for my body during the upcoming spring/summer months and I loved the idea of this sunscreen. I especially loved the ingredients and fragrance free aspect. Unfortunately, as other customers reviewed - it does indeed have a scent. I was not too crazy about the scent so I returned it. It's not a fruity or sweet smell, more of a chemical scent which was light but I could smell on my arm especially if my arm was near my face. 
PRO: it does rub in very nicely, no white cast (I'm tanned), not greasy. * Ill preface with this- I am a pale white lady, so I cannot trally speak to if it truly causes a cast. I have not noticed one personally.
I really like how smoothly and quickly this rubs in. And it doesn't smell. Its my daily go to for my body before heading out for the day. The only downfall ive found is that it's pricey."

No greasy feeling. * I suffered all day with irritated burning eyes after using this product. * This suncreen spray is very oily. The directions state that you can apply over makeup but I would not recommend that, it will have you looking like a glazed donut & your makeup just might slide off. The coola makeup setting spray is a better option if you are looking for something that does not make your face oily. It does feels a little drying but its better then the mist. * I did not expect it to have such a strong alcohol like scent to it. It makes sense as it is quick drying, but the smell was off-putting to me. * So this product did prevent me from getting sunburned while I had on a full face of makeup. HOWEVER this spray left me a shiny, greasy mess which accentuated all of my texture. It did not disrupt my makeup, but it did make my makeup look worse. * It doesnt feel greasy but it looks greasy.

I have oily prone/acne prone skin and it also doesn't make me look/feel greasy which I like!

I think brands should be more transparent about informing their customers that they're actually buying a different product than what they're used to. The consistency of the new cream is thicker and harder to spread, but what stands out the most to me is the smell: somewhere in between Play-Doh and generic baby sunscreen. My partner has sensitive skin around his eyes, and the old formula didn't cause him any burning, but the new one does. I wouldn't buy this again. * I bought this because it had avobenzone but no octocrylene (at the time). Great texture but I reacted badly to something in it. Guessing it was the algae because I've used the other ingredients before without issue. * DO NOT BUY new formula is horrible. Not the same product whatsoever. Why ruin a great product everyone loved?? Makes no sense. Ive gone through at least 10 of these moisturizers and now i will no longer purchase. And the new scent is a crime against humanity. * This used to be SOOOO awesome.  Now my face oily by 10 am and feels very irritated.  Also broke me out for the first time in a while.  Had zero issues with the old formula.  I really hope they change it back * What a great and rich sunscreen! The texture of this is super rich and hydrating while feeling so comfortable on my skin. I love that it doesn't leave a white film over my skin, it just soaks right in. Gifted by Supergoop * This was my holy grail of moisturizers with sunscreen for years. It kept my skin hydrated without making it greasy, had no scent, played well with any eye cream I paired it with and never broke me out. Since the formula change, this has given me nothing but problems.
First is the scent. IT REEKS. It smells like a burning pit and the smell does NOT dissipate. I am super sensitive to scents and the old formula had a slight smell to it but you didn't notice it after you put it on.
Next, the consistency is now a bit chalky and not as creamy as it used to be.
Lastly, the hydration is gone. My skin is dry about 45 minutes after I put this on. Now, that could be mostly due to my skin hating the new formula, so take this as you will.
I hate that I have to stop using this. It was a decent price and worked well for me which can be hard to come by, but I'll sadly have to give it up. * Leave my skin oily and shiny , but i still use it because it was blending good with my make up and wasn't leaving a white cast on my skin until i checked the actives ingredients are not recommended for breastfeeding (actually not good for anyone) and it has a sunscreen smell so  im switching to a mineral susncreen."

I also had to get rid of a cover up because the oil residue transferred and stained it.   I was so disappointed because I usually love this brand. * I was really excited about this product. I applied generously and every 40 minutes like the directions. No water or anything. I am absolutely fried. I know oil attracts sun but i thought a 50 SPF product would do something.

Smells great too! * Im pretty sure there is no spf in this… I reapplied generously and only the areas that i used this got absolutely fried!

Except it doesnt fully absorb, leaves a deathly white cast to my already ghosty face, and is impossible to layer.

I only used a little bit of the product and I thought that would help, but I still ended up looking like a ghost. For context, I've very light skinned and it was still really obvious on my face.

It doesn't irritate his face, and no complaints about his eyes stinging. Unlike most sunscreens, it's not messy to apply to a squirming kid.

It smells so good, isnt greasy, rubs in really well. Im not sure i would pay full price but i stock up on sale and it is worth it. * This product separated about a few days after I purchased it. No matter how much i shaked it, it was never the same again. I still got sunburnt really bad at the beach even when I was diligently reapplying a lot every 2 hours as instructed on the bottle. The scent is okay & it makes me feel greasy but because of that it does leave a nice sheen, which i like. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product. In fact, i think its very dangerous that they are advertising this as spf 50 when the sun protection didnt help me at the beach. I was surprised to find out how burnt i got because i was also hanging out in my beach tent for majority of the day. For those who have a history of skin cancer or concerned about it, i would stay away from this. * Great SPF. Vacation makes an excellent line of products. My husband puts this on everytime he goes deep sea fishing and it works. * Smells great and isnt sticky or thick, i wish the scent was a little stronger though * Works well if you don't plan on going into water. Otherwise it needs reapplied, which makes the product get used up fairly quickly. * Smells amazing and very moisturizing. The texture is slightly heavy—it dries down a bit sticky but gives a nice glossy look. I wish it was a bit lighter but love how it looks. The scent is enough make to make it worth it."

My daughter has incredibly fair skin and this was so white it wouldn't even blend in to look less ridiculous. Remember how lifeguards would put zinc oxide on their noses? This is that level of coverage and appearance. 

On a positive note, I then purchase Sun Bum 50spf for kids. It's clear, smells amazing and works great too. * Brought this hoping it would work as well as the supergoop stick but does not. Definitely leaves a white cast in person and pictures. Would not recommended. * Definetly needs to be rubbed in after applying. But other then that it works great!"

I'll start with the scent. It definitely smells like a sun care product. It's not overpowering at all. The consistency is great. It's a nice gel/cream and you don't need much to cover an area.

First, it remains pretty visible on skin - no white cast, but it does leave me looking visibly greasy in a way that other moisturizers and even some sunscreen doesn't. This is a non-issue if I am wearing makeup over it, but having to put makeup on takes away from the convenience. The other issue is that it starts coming off my face after 12-16 hours of being on. Once it hits that point, it inevitably ends up stinging my eyes. As long as I put it on late in the morning and wash my face as soon as I get home from work, it is fine but if that is not an option I find myself reaching for something else. * I bought this product and found that my skin felt Hester after only one use. * I was looking for a new SPF and this had good enough reviews to give it a try. I absolutely love it. I have oily skin and this combined with a finishing powder leaves me oil free all day. It doesn't sting my eyes or cause my makeup to slip either. * If you have combination to oily skin, I would not recommend this product. It broke me out badly. * Heavy ans greasy spf, skins feels like it can't breathe * Bought this in hopes that I would find a daily moisturizer and sunscreen combo that wouldn't leave an oil slick on my face. This worked as a sunscreen but has me super greasy 40 minutes after application and also caused some redness. * Although this moisturizer is marketed for sensitive skin it broke me out so bad and gave me a rash all over my face and chest.

I use it on my body now but the consistency of the product isn't great; it's super oily. I normally love Neutrogena skin products but this was a no from me :( * Burns burns burns * I was looking for a new sunscreen and happened to pick this up. It has a very creamy consistency. I don't know if I got a bad batch because the first time I applied some liquid came out with it. Even with shaking before applying, the sunscreen was still very shiny. It felt VERY wet on my face but this feeling did go away after a few minutes of wearing it. I have noticed that I've broken out a little more and that some of the acne has lasted longer than they normally do after I added this to my routine. Also, the sunscreen has a very orange tone to it. I'm cool toned and I don't know if I'm just seeing things but I noticed a slight difference in skin tone between the second and third picture after rubbing it in. I didn't notice sensitivity to my eyes when I was using this, so that's good! I'll probably be finishing this up as a body sunscreen. I'd say that if you have drier skin, aren't acne-prone, and have a warmer undertone this would probably work better for you than me! * After about 20 mins this sunscreen burns my eyes, even after wiping it off it burns…. would not reccomend * Pros: peach colored = no white cast on skin, goes on smoothly, very spreadable, seems to last, doesn't clog pores

Cons: cannot apply to eye area because product spreads throughout the day and gets into eyes and burns * I dont mind scents really and actually enjoy when something smells good. But this was strong. Its a very strong floral scent. Like it doesnt go away and you smell it when you move. If you get too close to your eyes it can burn. It did blend in nicely and was very moisturizing. But it doesnt seem to dry down at all. Too moisturizing for me as i was very shiny. Bordoeline greasy.  It did look good under makeup. I would suggest for very dry skin if you dont mind heavy scents. But theres better options imo. * After about 10 minutes outdoors, my eyes started stinging/burning very badly. I had to use my shirt to try and wipe away all of the product away from around my eye area, and i didnt put it around my eyes at all. I had to really scrub at the skin around my eyes to get enough off that i could go on with my day."

This SPF is perfect for this dreadful Texas humidity and heat. It's very lightweight, non-greasy, and has a pleasant scent. Reapplying is a breeze since the product doesn't build up on the skin or cause a film. It's very breathable and works well with general skin sensitivities. The size is quite large for travel, but still small enough to throw in your beach bag and still have space for other necessities. It has a click-locking spray top so it doesn't accidentally spray in your bag. I will say that if your skin is very dry, you may want to go for a cream SPF because this does not provide much moisture. This is definitely made for hot, sunny summers. I love it and I know for sure I am buying a full-sized bottle to keep on hand.

***This review was collected as part of a promotion.*** * As a professional in the beauty industry, I've learned firsthand the  importance of sun protection, making COOLA's  spray an indispensable asset. In an industry where skincare is very important, COOLA stands out with its dedication to not only protecting against harmful UV rays but also enhancing the overall experience of sun care.

COOLA's sunscreen spray doesn't just shield your skin from UVA and UVB rays; Its broad-spectrum protection ensures comprehensive coverage, safeguarding against both premature aging and potential skin damage. As someone deeply invested in skin health, I love COOLA's commitment to providing a product that protects and cares for my skin.

The scent of Piña Colada fragrance is delicious. Gone are the days of sunscreen smelling like, well, sunscreen. Instead, COOLA's tropical scent transports me to my last vacation. It's a big change from the clinical smell of traditional sunscreens, making the application process a sensory experience.

I did not have any issue in my delicate skin but I always recommend  a patch test.

In my personal opinion, COOLA's in spray isn't just a sun protection product; it's an  evolution of skincare. With its comprehensive protection, anti-aging benefits, and irresistible Piña Colada scent, COOLA has redefined what it means to stay safe in the sun. So, whether I am lounging by the pool or hitting the beach, I make COOLA my go-to companion for summer adventures. And a big pus smells delicious! * The COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a delightful sun protection experience. Its tropical scent evokes visions of sunny beaches and relaxation, enhancing the application process with a touch of indulgence. The organic formula boasts SPF 30, providing reliable protection against both UVA and UVB rays, crucial for preventing sunburn and long-term skin damage. What sets this sunscreen apart is its lightweight texture, which absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. This feature is particularly appealing for those who dislike the heavy feeling often associated with sunscreen application. The spray mechanism ensures effortless and even coverage, making it convenient for reapplication throughout the day, especially during outdoor activities. Furthermore, the use of organic ingredients adds to its appeal for those who prioritize natural  products. 

 In conclusion, the COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a luxurious and effective sun protection solution for those who appreciate both quality and indulgence in their routine. * As a licensed Esthetician, we our taught early on how important using SPF to protect our skin. This aerosol is easy to use and smells amazing! If you have sensitive skin I would recommend spraying into your hands first then applying. I did have a slightly burning feel when I sprayed directly. But, overall I really love how cute and small and effective this spf is to use. My skin adapted the more I used this spf. * I love this sunscreen! Its perfect for travel and smells great. I used it almost all up on my recent vacation. It smells likea tropical holiday on a beach with a coconut. I would definetly recommend. I know the spf is quality and better packaged and easily portable. * This review was collected as part of a promotion. My name is Michele and I'm a Beauty Expert in my early 30's with fair combination skin. As the weather gets warmer, I have to make sunscreen a priority in my skincare routine. I am absolutely loving the Coola Clear Spray Body Sunscreen SPF 30 Piña Colada Sunscreen. I love its yummy, natural Piña Colada scent. It takes me away on a vacation to my favorite beach. This is a non-aerosol sunscreen that is so easy to spray onto your skin. It has a lightweight, lighter than air, mist texture that absorbs so quickly into my skin without leaving any greasy residue. I got the chance to try the full size 6 fluid ounce version of this spray sunscreen. This sunscreen is formulated with at least 70% Organic Ingredients. You get broad spectrum SPF 30 UVA and UVB protection. This sunscreen has water resistance that lasts up to 80 minutes so you can enjoy more time in the sun and water without worrying about reapplying every hour. With this amazing sunscreen you not only protect your skin but keep it hydrated too. Plant Protection is formulated with antioxidant rich nutrients which help fight free radicals, hydrates and nourishes your skin barrier too. Safflower Oleosomes is plant derived encapsulation technology that makes this formulation even more effective. Spray this sunscreen on your skin 15 minutes before any sun exposure. Make sure to reapply this sunscreen every 80 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone of any age who loves the sun and wants to have lightweight, long lasting and fast absorbing sun protection that also keeps your skin hydrated too. * Sun care is very important because it can help prevent skin cancer. I can't stress enough how important it is to wear sunscreen everyday. I was looking for a new everyday sunscreen and I think I found it. I prefer spray sunscreen than a cream so this one is perfect. It smells absolutely amazing and I love it! With most sunscreens they can get really heavy and greasy. I was really pleased that it absorbs really well on the skin and doesn't leave a layer of oil behind. Another thing I like is the ingredients, because I was having a hard time finding sunscreens that didn't have harsh or harmful ingredients. The Coola brand has organic and vegan ingredients so no worries about having harmful chemicals being absorbed in your body. So far so good and I would repurchase it."

Conflict free and does a great job! * I use this sunscreen everyday!

It doesn't break me out, has SPF 50, and lasts soooooo long!
I use this every single day. I took this on my 2 month European trip and wore this for my main protection. It didn't sweat off in the humidity and it didn't make me a greaseball on top of the sweat I was dripping. One bottle lasts me a minimum of 6months with exclusive, daily use on the face.
There is no cons. It's affordable, does what it claims, and is nice on the skin (bare or under makeup). I highly recommend this for everyone for any parts of the body. * Gets the job done and protects my extremely fair skin. Minimal smell and no white cast. However it can look quite oily so I just apply setting powder and setting spray over top and touch uo throughout the day. Has never caused my dry combo skin to break out. * Goes on smoothing and white cast free. Moisturizing. A little goes a long way. * This sunscreeb got me through a month in Italy with temperatures over 100+ degrees and stood up well throughout sweat. I'm very fair and didn't get sunburnt.

It absorbs very quickly, lightweight, and help controls my oil production throughout the day. I still have to blot my face in the afternoon, but it helps. I also like to use a water base moisturizer underneath :) 
PLEASE NOTE* a little goes A LONG WAY! 
Your face will be a grease pit if you put too much on, learned the hard way. * I dont get why some people love the ""dewey"" effect because at least on me, when I put this sunscreen on, it felt like I just spent the day frying stuff in the kitchen and all sweaty, right after my shower! It went straight to the trash can. * This sunscreen reminded me of a drugstore formula, not something I'd expect from Shiseido. It has an oily, sticky texture - not like your typical Shiseido sunscreen or a clear sunscreen like Supergoop. It's greasy, doesn't absorb well, and it stings the eyes terribly like a poorly-formulated budget buy. I really dislike it and will be returning it."

I feel like I need to apply so much for it to work. Plus it's very small for the price. * The first bottle i bought was perfect. The sunscreen is incredible and makes you look so glowy. Doesnt break me out. I didnt have an issue with the bottle leaking. I just bought a second bottle and it is just not travel friendly at all. Half of it spilled in my toiletry bag. Id love for the packaging to get fixed so its not leaky but the product itself is top notch. Only sunscreen id ever use on my face * I do like this. It has a slight tint that when applied it's hardly noticeable but sunscreen seems a little drying but not as much as some other tinted sunscreens that I""ve tried. Would buy this again. * I find this sunscreen perfect for sitting under makeup or wearing it alone. * This sunscreen has Butyloctyl Salicylate, a cousin to octisalate, and a chemical UV absorber. That's how they can get a higher SPF with such a low concentration of Zinc or TO. So it isn't purely mineral. I like it and use it, but I wish they wouldn't market it as 100% mineral when it has unregulated chemical UV absorbers in it."

It is very lightweight and goes on sheer. I have very dry skin and most mineral sunscreens leave my skin uncomfortably dry after 2 hours. This is not the case with the blue lizzard sunscreen. I am able to wear it and reaply without my skin feeling uncomfortable. This is a great product for the price. * When applying the proper amount, it does leave a white cast on brown skin. But feels great on skin * I was recommended by a dermalogist to use blue lizard. I have dark brown spots.I have been using this product for over 6 years. I have noticed a difference on my face. * I've heard nothing but good things about this brand and when I ran out of my current face sunscreen, I decided to try this one. I love that it's an SPF50. That's honestly the only positive thing I can say about this sunscreen. It comes out pretty runny, but it's the consistency of Elmer's Glue and I imagine that this is exactly what it would feel like if you tried to rub glue into your face. On top of being difficult to apply, it leaves a horrible white cast. This one was a miss for me. * Works incredibly well. Mild scent, but liquidy. Does take a little longer to rub in because of the consistency. However, it works! My son had a small pink spot after a full day of sun on his face. A little after suncare and the next day the pink spot was gone. Highly recommened * Blue Lizard is an excellent sunscreen.  I wanted to like this.  I need something I can wear under makeup.

It comes out of the bottle a little watery and then feels like silk as your rubbing it into your skin.  I love that this has a high SPF than most facial sunscreens. * If you've ever tried the Supergoop invisible sunscreen, this is practically the same thing for HALF the cost! Though highly raved about, I personally never enjoyed the Supergoop formula because the heavy silicone texture was off-putting and did nothing for my dry skin. It just felt like I was wearing a slippery silicone mask all day. I prefer dewy SPF lotions for this reason. They provide hydration and protection all in one. However, I love Sun Bum sunscreens so I still wanted to give this a try! The term ""gel"" is slightly misleading because it makes you think of a cooling gel consistency which this is not. This is definitely that same silicone texture, but the formula has a more hydrating quality to it. The silicone base gives it a mattifying texture which makes it invisible on the skin. The more exciting part: this is weightless and DOES NOT BURN THE EYES! I have yet to find a single U.S. chemical sunscreen that doesn't burn my eyes into oblivion. I don't know how this formula would hold up on the beach or under extreme sweating/activity, but I fully recommend (as it's advertised) for daily wear or under makeup. Sun Bum is killing it! * This is hands down the best-looking sunscreen I've ever tried.  Unlike other gel sunscreens, this one doesn't pill. * This contains coconut oil as one of the first ingredients.  If you are easily acne prone and/or prone to clogged pores stay away.  Coconut oil is HIGHLY comedogenic.  It would be nice if they created a facial sunscreen that is noncomedogenic. * I used sunscreen everyday. Feels good under makeup! It almost has a matte feeling - sorta like a primer. Definitely not the average face sun CREAM. Gel is in the name, gel is exactly the consistency! I would buy again! * It does not smell good. Especially vs all of their other products. Left a very oily/greasy sheen behind. Ended up taking it back."

Not sure if it's the probiotics or my specific bottle, but it smells sour and has stayed smelly all day * I like the product itself - it feels like a really lightweight serum that I much prefer to use as opposed to a thicker spf as the last step in my skincare before makeup. However, I won't be repurchasing because the pump bottle consistantly sprays everywhere and ends up getting the product all over me (and not the back of my hand where I'm trying for!) Because it's such a thin, liquidy formula, a pour component would be much better and less messy because this really is a pain to use. * I do not like the application the pump makes it messy. If you have oily of combination skin do not get this product it gives you a dewy look and  with wear it makes your skin greases. I like the overall packaging."

It taste like was eating sunscreen. * I was looking for a lip product with SPF for the summer months and running outside. I love the flavor and texture of this product, and it is very moisturizing.

I have sensitive skin and this didn't irritate it at all. Favorite part was that it wasnt greasy at all. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars its pricey for the size. * So i love how this feels in my skin. I can feel it, but it doesn't look greasy. Does make my make up more prone to smudging when im setting it which is annoying. Smudges when i apply over make up which is annoying, but perhaps wouldn't be so noticeable on lighter make up days. * This js a great sunscreen stick. Does not break me out (a miracle), glides over the skin without tugging, leaves make mostly intact (mostly), and feels comfortable on the skin. However - the stick is a round shape, and fairly wide. This makes it extremely difficult-to-impossible to get the stick anyway with angles or crevices. I cant get the stick to apply near my eyes and between my brows at the base of the nose. Other than that, I have nothing bad to say about this product. Highly recommend! * I burn very easily but love the sun. Every other face sunscreen I have tried eventually makes my combo skin too oily…and I've tried dozens of different brands. 

This glides on easily, doesn't feel greasy and I don't burn at all. There is a light barrier left on the face after application, which I don't mind. Much better for me than lotion or serum type sunscreen that eventually turns to grease on my face. Bonus points for not being a liquid, which makes it perfect for flying. Worth the trip to a local Ulta given that it's been sold out online for a while. * I love the unseen for my face and i was so hyped when they came out with a body version but in application that one was way too oily for someone like me who uses it when im outside working and sweating. But this? THIS!? Perfect for applying on tattoos (which i have) and its not oily. The viscosity of this is perfect if you're like me and really only show your arms. It obviously works since my tattoos haven't felt like they're about to burn off now. * I am terrible at putting on sunscreen- but this stick has changed the game for me! So easy to travel with, and if I forget to apply it at home it just takes seconds to apply wherever I am! No strong scent, not tacky, not oily! The best!"

If you have the time to wait then it's great! But not recommended for someone like me who rushes in the morning and doesn't like white stains. * ...than the Blue Lizard Sensitive product, same price, larger volume? I just took tubes of both on vacation. None of us could tell the difference between Sheer and Sensitive; the latter is cheaper, for le$$. I will absolutely repurchase the Sensitive formula. * Works incredibly well. Mild scent, lightiy whipped consistency. Does take a little longer to rub in because of the consistency.

It's thick but doesn't feel moisturizing at all. I live in the desert and do a super juicy skincare routine and have oily skin. Because my skin is beyond drenched, when I put this on last, that dewiness still comes through and I feel like my skin doesn't look massively oily as the day goes on. But again, I'm doing a lot of moisturizing steps before hand. If you're dry or doing light skincare, this is gunna make you look parched. It gives no coverage, but I think it tamps down my redness a little bit. I haven't tried this under makeup. The color looks dark out the tube but on me (light tan) it blends well. Darker skin will probably have a white cast. It does transfer so watch out for your clothes. My main con is the smell. It's like a citrus kitchen cleaner that's heavy on the cleaner part. Not pleasant at all. It goes away, but lordy I hold my breath until then. * My favorite sunscreen so far. I have medium - tan skin so I have a hard time finding sunscreens that dont make me look like I have unblended white on my face. This tint is perfect and not overpowering. This is great for people who want a natural look and sun protection. I dont feel greasy or oily either. * This is my everyday sunscreen. It has a slight tint which is perfect for me even with my fair skin. With this, a little spot concealer, blush, brow tint and mascara, im good for the day. I do set with a light setting powder and it wears beautifully. I purchased almost 4 times already and will continue to do so. Great product * This burns my skin. I'm 58 with sensitive skin. The ""mineral"" sold me. 
Also it's a dark tint. Not for fair skin. * This is the only sunscreen that ive repurchased 5x. Im brown skinned and this doesnt leave a white cast, blends so easily and blurs any imperfections. Will always be my everyday sunscreen! Please never discontinue! * I have combination to oily skin. Every face sunscreen I've used would make my face feel super oily before it is time to reapply. This sunscreen doesn't make me oily and my face still feels soft. It doesnt clog up my pores like other face sunscreens. I have used sunbum, blue lizard, and little hands. I love these bc they dont irritate my skin. Bliss block star is the only one that doesnt leave streaks. Of course if swimming I would use the others since block star isnt meant for it."

Does blend in with your skin color and slightly blurs skin brown spots and blemishes. * Hey Ulta, Dimethicone is a silicone. This product should not come up with your silicone free search filter. * I dont really like SPF's they break my skin out but i do love this one.

This product has great ingredients and doesnt break my skin out!! The onlt SPF i'll use * Out of all the brands I've tried through working at Ulta, Dermalogica has the BEST SPF! This one is mineral and blends right into you're skin with no white cast, which is hard to find. Esthetician approved :) * Sunscreens breakout my skin out so badly- but not this one!  Plus, it's a mineral sunscreen that isn't heavy and has ZERO white cast. I love that it softens out the appearance of my pores and lines- for no makeup days- but doesn't pill with makeup! * Gifted by Dermalogica- I've always been a big fan of their skin care products so I knew I had to try their sunscreen.

No skin burning, no irritation, no strong scent. My husband and my son both work outdoors for a good portion of their jobs and they have no complaints! * Im reading a lot of reviews and honestly yall dont know how to use sunscreen. Why are you spraying it directly on your face and over your makeup. If you are using it on your face spray some in your hands and pat it of your face and also do a patch test when trying new products. Everyone skin is different. * The best sunscreen for me. * I bought this just to use to go to the beach, but the next morning my skin looked so good. I started using it daily as part of my morning routine and I get compliments all the time about my skin. I saw someone didn't like that you couldn't spray directly to the face but honestly as an oily skin girl, it really should be rubbed into the skin, otherwise it just sits on top very dewy. I am at work at 7 and normally oily by 1 but since using this, I have a nice glow but significantly less oily than I am bare faced. I also don't wear makeup to work, drink lots of water, and barely get 6 hours sleep. So I promise you it really is the sunscreen because my habits have gotten worst but my face is still improving from being acne prone and very sensitive. They make a version specifically for face I want to try. * Love this product, i spray a little in my hand and rub into my face, neck, chest and arms for an amazing glow. My coworker kept saying this is something extremely beautiful about your skin…had to share my secret lol * You will only be able to spray your full body two times with this sunscreen.

Doesn't leave a white cast, doesn't break me out, and doesn't sting my eyes, and it's not horrendously expensive! * I've tried so many different sunscreens but I keep coming back to this. It's light, not greasy and doesn't tighten on the skin like a lot of zinc sunscreens do. I have pretty fair skin and I don't get the orange look that other are talking about. I do 2 pumps on my face and 1 pump on my neck * After using this product for some time now I do love that I don't have to worry about any white cast and I do feel that it does a great job protecting my skin but I'm one of those people who are sensitive to smells so although there's no fragrance added to it it still doesn't smell great to me. Thankfully it doesn't last long so I can go about my day unbothered by it except for the initial application. * This is just okay. Alone its fine but under make up its terrible. Wheb i out foundation on top of this it slides all over mu face and makes me look muddy. * I bought this on sale and love it! It leaves you with a pearly glow… if you're daur skin might not be for you since it has an apricot finish… add some bronzing drops and this was all I needed for coverage and sun protection. * I was excited to try this because I love the other force sheild sunscreen, but it made me look orange!! Formula feels the same as the green one. I have really fair skin (Mac studio fix NC10 for reference). Similar to the pigment in the redness reducing rescue hero, just too much color for my skin & I don't tan in the summer. So sadly I will be returning. Would recommend for medium/fair and darker complexions!! * This is really good by itself, I havent put it on under my makeup. I received a sample when I ordered some other Hero products. I liked this sample so much, I ordered it :) Hero is a great brand as is but this stuff gives a great glow and protection. I use this on my face, neck, and chest. I'll use regular over the counter sunscreen for my body. Try it!"

If you sweat it won't run and become white. A little provides good coverage. It's scentless so it's perfect for when you wear your own scent/parfum. I am super happy with BGS * I love supporting black owned businesses especially in skin care. quite often our skin is not considered with product formulation. I would much rather spend my money with a company that's being intentional. with that said I love the clear application. never an issue with a white cast. goes well as a first layer before makeup and no pilling. 
downsides are for me as someone with combination skin and acne prone I do not do well with this sunscreen especially in the summertime. my face just kind of stays oily and greasy. for someone with dry skin or who isn't acne prone it would probably appear as a nice glow for them. for me it's just greasy and I feel like my summer breakouts never go away. so if you have the right skin type this could be a great SPF for you. if you're acne prone with combo skin I recommend to keep looking. * This sunscreen is completely clear and very effective. There is no fragrance and it is smooth going on, like a primer. Feels good to have a sunscreen without the white cast. * I absolutely love the coverage and texture of this product.  I break out easily,  so I'm hesitant to try new products on my face. * Yes, I do indeed buy this product regularly for a few years because it's just that good.  This sunscreen goes on smoothly and vanishes quickly without leaving an ashy appearance. After it dries, apply your favorite SPF moisturizer and blend. BGS is the best sunscreen I've ever tried. * I absolutely love this sunscreen. It's so smooth on my skin and mixes well with my other skincare products! It also does well with my eczema, I recommend this. * I love this sunscreen! On my deeper complexion it gives me a very nice matte finish and glow.

Every sunscreen on the market that says ""acne safe"" or ""non comedigenic"" still break me out.  I have VERY sensitive skin and eyes, and this bever burns or stings.  It does what it says it does.  It also does not pill under makeup.  If yoy're a dark skintone, you will HAVE to wear fou dation over this, as it does leave the normal mineral sinscreen white cast. * Its moisturizing and leaves a slight white cast for my POC folks and I havent gotten sunburnt while on it. Doesnt feel too heavy but you'll notice it on your face. No chemically smell and doesn't make my eyes sensitive. Its good under makeup. Haven't tried it in water. Great for folks with combo, dry, or normal skin types. It does what it says it does, but nothing magnanimous especially considering the price and quantity. Other sunscreens at lower price points get the job done the same, if not better. For acne prone skin, Good Molecules and Hero have good sunscreens as well. Otherwise, its worth a try if you want a physical sunscreen. * This formual is amazing. I love the finish it has and I have no textural problems realplying this every 2 hours. Best sunscreen I've ever tried. * I am in shock at the bad reviews 😂 I am a 30 y.o. brownskin black women and this product works perfect for my combination, acne prone skin. Not sure what smell the negative reviews are referring to - if anything it smells very neutral, barely has a smell. I have used other SPFs that I had to wash off and throw away because of the overwhelming smell but that is not the case with this product. As far blending and applying under makeup, it is 100% effective. I think some people are not using it properly or are not prepping the skin properly or the SPF is not compatible with the skincare products others are using. I have used this SPF on top of PCA skin and Face Reality. I have routine appts with my esthetician who introduced me to this SPF and I have never looked back. A little goes a long and if you have a white cast, you more than likely used too much. I sometimes apply too much but I am able to blend it out which removes the white cast. 10/10 for me! * I used their matte mineral sunscreen for almost 2 years, but as I've started to reach my 30s, my skin is getting more dry. So having my sunscreen be ""matte"" was no longer a priority. My skin is sensitive so I had to stick to mineral sunscreen, so I decided to try this one. Every mineral sunscreen I've tried has a slight white cast, and you're not going to get away from that with this product either. However it is blendable as it claims to be. 
This one works better with my makeup than the matte sunscreen did. My makeup doesn't seperate over the top of it. 
Id say to give it a try & see if it works for you! * Looked awful under makeup. Foundation would not blend causing a patchy mess.  Had to return. * This sunscreen has great ingredients for oily and acne, prone skin like mine. However, it absolutely leaves a white cast, and started pilling almost immediately. I prepped my skin properly, including moisturizer prior, and it started pilling right away. Definitely returning."

Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation.

It's not invisble, but applies and blends in a way that makes it look like I've just used a brightening, highlighting primer all over my fave. I can tell where I've applied it because of it's slight contrast on my skin, but that helps me to be sure I haven't missed any spots. After I put it on, I just use bronzer around my jaw and hairline to make it look more natural and completely mask the contrast between my scalp and the brightening effect of the sunscreen. It's more glittery than necessart, but it looks great on me! No ashiness, or gray and purple tones. Will repurchase forever. * Wore it for the first time while at the beach, reapplied and still got burned. Its thin and slides right off. No not recommend * It smells like paint and, yeah its mineral sunscreen, but other mineral sunscreens I use do not have what feels like sand in it. Its too harsh for my skin and smells so bad. I will be returning it. * Sunscreen should be an essential part of any skincare routine. However for my skin, this has been nearly impossible. I have tried probably close to 15 different sunscreens, mineral to chemical, ones from Asian companies and American ""clean'' companies. They all caused a range of problems such as breaking me face out with pimples everywhere, a white cast, or turning my skin bright red. This sunscreen however actually makes my skin BETTER. It gives it such a nice glow perfect for no makeup days. My only critique would be that it is very very glittery. I personally like this but for some I could see them not liking it. * I purchased this because I love Kopari products and this does not disappoint.  I use it every morning before I go walking here at over 6,000 feet elevation, where the sun is brutal. I like the way the sunscreen has a slight tint…no white cast whatsoever.  It has no smell, which I also appreciate.  I am planning to buy more when I run out. * I love that it's all mineral and so lightweight and sheer!  It doesn't feel like I have any thing on at all, and I like the touch of Vitamin C * Love this sheer mineral sunscreen, it blends right into your skin, no whitecast.

I am very pleased think I found my new one for the summer! I like how it absorbs into the skin and doesn't build up like some of the others I've used in the past. I also love the fact that it's cruelty free and vegan and has a lot of healthy ingredients such as Prickly Pear Extract, Raspberry Seed Oil, and Buriti Oil. And safe for the environment and Hawaii Reef Compliant so unique and I'm so happy to try such a lovely product. Definitely I recommend and will look at other products from the COOLA family!! * First off I absolutely love this. I love that it's not oily or sticky like most other sunscreens. This product is by far one of my favorite sun screens. One thing about this sunscreen is you can barely even tell you are wearing it and it honestly feels hydrating, this is perfect for anyone that is outside a lot or looking for the perfect sunscreen to protect your skin from sun burn and damage! The scent isn't overpowering and as a mom this is my go to sunscreen and I've noticed that it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated! This product is a must have if you're looking for sunscreen that doesn't smell over powering and leaves your skin feeling hydrated but also protects your skin from sunburns and damage ! I highly recommend this sunscreen!

**This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I am absolutely SPF-obsessed. When it comes to sunscreen, particularly for the body, I have a stringent set of criteria. Thankfully, Coola's Peach Blossom Body Sunscreen ticks off all the right boxes. This product seamlessly blends into the skin, eliminating that dreaded sticky, greasy feeling that often accompanies other sunscreens. Instead, it leaves behind a beautifully hydrated finish, which is exactly the radiant look I always aim for. The scent is subtle yet sweet, adding a touch of luxury to the application experience. And let's not overlook the SPF 70 protection level – talk about serious sun defense! If you're on the hunt for a top-tier sunscreen that delivers on both performance and sensory delight, I highly recommend giving this one a try.

This review was collected as part of a promotion * As a mom and someone who tries to avoid getting sunburned this body sunscreen is the best I've ever tried! For starters it is 70% organic. The ingredients, sustainability and overall what the product stands by is absolutely incredible. Living in NC with the fluctuations of temp and weather, I had the privilege to try it out and it gave me the best sunscreen coverage and on top of that the application process was extremely easy! This sunscreen has a smell of peaches which smells amazing and on top of that reminds you of the beach as well. Another thing I loved about this product was the fact that it wasn't sticky or hard to apply. It rubbed in so smoothly. I applied it everyday 15 mins before going out. If you have a toddler who has sensitivity like my little one does this product is great. Every two hours I reapplied it on her and myself and it worked absolutely great! * Skincare is very important to me. On my days off from work I spend a lot of time outside. Whether it's taking my kids to the park or spending time gardening, I make sure to apply sunscreen. It's difficult finding the right sunscreens. COOLA Peach Blossom Classic Body Sunscreen SPF 70 is a great choice for those who are looking for lightweight sunscreen. I like that it's not too thick or sticky and It blends easily, absorbs pretty quick and I love that it doesn't leave a white cast. It's a plus that it has organic ingredients. I prefer unscented products because most scents can be overwhelming but I actually like the peach blossom scent it's not overpowering at all.   The scent wears off pretty quick, which is perfect for me. The other thing I like is that when you squeeze the bottle the hole is quite small and can control the amount of product that gets squeezed out. I also noticed that it leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I'm honestly happy with this product and highly recommended. This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I tried out the COOLA Peach Blossom Classic Body Sunscreen SPF 70, and let me tell you, it's pretty awesome. This stuff isn't your average sunscreen I've been around a lot of cosmetics while working at a makeup store and this product is like a little slice of paradise in a bottle.First off, sun protection. With SPF 70, you're getting serious defense against those pesky UV rays. Whether you're just chilling on the beach or just running errands, COOLA Peach Blossom has got your back literally. let's talk about the smell. Oh man, it's heavenly. The sweet scent of fresh peaches mixed with a hint of floral. It smells like summer in a bottle, seriously. The best part it's reef friendly and free of all those nasty chemicals. So you can feel good about using it, knowing you're not harming the environment.Application is great, it goes on smooth and absorbs quickly without leaving you feeling greasy. Plus, the packaging is cute and travel friendly, so you can take it with you wherever you go.Bottom line, this sunscreen is game changer. It's effective, it smells amazing, and it's good for your skin

Yes, it blends out well but it just stays on top of your skin and leaves you with a greasy feeling. Also, for the price… definitely not worth it. I couldnt even finish the whole bottle because it was breaking me out so bad. Some people are saying its good for people with acne prone skin but as someone with acne prone skin, yeah it is not it. I gave it to a relative because i didnt want to be wasteful and even they didnt like it and theyre honestly not that picky with their skincare. Korean sunscreens are the way to go especially if youre acne prone and the prices are a lot more cheaper! * This has been my daily sunscreen since the start of this year and don't plan on changing anytime soon! * This is the acne friendly spf out there. I workout outside everyday in FL, so finding an SPF that was water and sweat resistant was important. I have tried so many, but thankfully I found this one. I've had so many bad breakouts from SPFs that claimed to be acne safe but this one actually is. * I'm usually a mineral sunscreen girlie because they don't irritate my eyes, I avoided chemical spfs for ages because they'd sting! But this spf doesn't sting at all, infact it's very gentle on my sensitive skin. It applies smoothly, no white cast at all, and sinks in after about 30 or so minutes. It's not greasy but does leave a dewy finish. Not much scent, but there is a subtle ""sunscreeny"" smell to it. * I was looking for a travel sized set of sunblock to take on vacation in January and stumbled upon Dune.  The fact it was gel was a huge influence and I bought the set.  Its pretty amazing.  It works into the skin nicely and doesnt leave my hands super sticky afterwards like some lotions do.  We ended up using all 3–the Mug Guard (face), Bod Guard (body) and Life Guard (after burn).  I just repurchased this full size Mug Guard (this is kind of a misnomer, as its only 2.2 oz) as its the one I use the most.  As a caveat, depending on what you have on your face, it *can* leave somewhat of a white cast.  Most of the time I'm fine, but there have been occasions where, depending on what moisturizer/serums I use, it does leave a bit of white on there.  Its not enough to make me stop using it, but its good to keep in mind.  Otherwise, I love the way it absorbs and how it feels. * Initially i thought this would work for me. I lived the fact that it was clear and felt it woudl absorb quickly too. However, having a recent health issue, i was disappointed to find Chemical UV Filters listed in the ingredients. My Dr. mentioned these filters mimic estrogen and can wreak havic with your endocrine system. So unfortunately I cannot risk using this lotion. * I was so pleasantly surprised by this sunscreen. I have extremely sensitive skin, acne, rosacea, eczema, you name it. Finding a sunscreen that doesnt cause a reaction felt impossible but alas sunscreen is a necessity. I took a chance on this when it was on sale because of the glowing reviews truthfully not expecting much other than an overpriced basic sunscreen. I am happy to admit I was wrong. I LOVE this sunscreen. It goes on so well, never breaks my skin out with rashes or acne, and reapplies without becoming a mess. I have started using this on my kids too. I came back to order more and leave this review. The bottle is small but it spreads out very well. 10/10 RECOMMEND if your skin cant tolerate most drug store brands."

After a while the cast will blend out but it still looks like my face is a shade lighter. It feels thick on the skin and feels a bit tacky all day. Be sure to avoid getting it on your hairline. My first attempt at buying this bottle, it was only filled half way so i contacted support to exchange it. The second bottle was more filled. Over all my experience with this particular product is a no go. There are better sunscreens out there for the same price. * If you are someone looking for an everyday-wear sunscreen, this one is for you. I find it very moisturizing and looks good under light makeup. I highly recommend using a beauty blender or brush to blend in the sunscreen after applying it with hands. Although it doesn't leave a white cast, it is harder to blend with just your fingers. Overall a very good sunscreen, would recommend to tweens, teens, and adults! * Finally a non toxic sunscreen. Been usuing got a couple weeks and I have zero complaints! A little bit goes a long way. * I really wanted to love this sunscreen but it left such a horrible white cast and would break my face out after every use. This product does contain several comdedogenic ingredients and sits heavily on top of the skin. * i had really high hopes for this sunscreen. it's definitely not perfect, but definitely better than others i have tried. i am usually the lightest shade in all makeup products, and it still leaves a white cast on me, so proceed with caution. i did like it for the most part, as someone with sensitive and acne-prone skin, this did not break me out, which was really nice. * I love this sunscreen! It's gentle, long-lasting, and doesn't feel like it makes my skin oily afterwards. I wish this came in a bigger bottle though! * The best mineral face sunscreen I have found. Other sunscreens cause irritation to my skin, maybe it is the non-nano sized mineral particles that makes my skin like this one. I have a dry skin type and this leaves my skin smooth and plump, and sometimes dewy depending on the environment. It layers well with moisturizer or other skincare and makeup. It leaves the slightest white cast but it's a mineral sunscreen, that's what you get."

I use this over the new Vitamin C moisturizer and the combo is great under makeup. Almost out of my first tube, will purchase a second one for sure! * I was hoping this would fall in like with the rest of their products which are very hydrating & glowy. This unfortunately dried my skin out & left it feeling chalky & matte. It also peels. I have used many mineral sunscreens & know that it can cause issues like this but there are others I have tried that don't. * I wanted to live this product but it pilled on my face :/ it also smells like oranges which is fine, but you're sensitive to fragrances, watch out * Only purchased once and probably wont again. Tried to love it * At first I loved this sunscreen. It has a great finish that is both matte and glowy. But as the day went on I noticed it was drying. Its also scented which I didnt like and is always a red flag for sensitive skin people like myself (and most people who use mineral SPF…) also the tint could look a little streaky depending on your complexion. Wanted to love but ultimately returned. * Loved it in the beginning but saw it had fragrance. I have really sensitive skin so over time it made my skin really dry at the end which is shocking considering i have oily combo skin. No white white cast which is a bonus! Would've been perfect if it had no fragrance. * I was so interested in trying this sunscreen, and it's just okay. The scent is really nice and doesn't irritate my skin, and it gives a pretty glow. My only problems are that it can make the skin feel dry, which is odd, for it leaving the skin looking dewy. And it is the worst under makeup. It pills and leaves the skin looking flaky. It's just a good sunscreen if you don't wear base makeup or no makeup at all."

Absorbed quickly. It did not make my skin oily. This newest tube is not good. While it still absorbs quickly it does not mattify my skin. I am very oily in a couple of hours if not before. I must note that i do shake the tube before use so i dont think im missing anything. * I used this as a cheaper alternative toy usual SPF  but it was greasy and broke me out. If i dont shake it i can see the oil. * I bought this sunscreen on accident because I thought it was a free gift and didn't check until I picked it up in store. However, I decided to use it because I needed a new sunscreen and surprisingly, this worked very well for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it sits on top of my other skin care products very well. This is also the first sunscreen that hasn't irritated my skin or burned my eyes which I truly appreciate because every sunscreen I've worn in the past had an extremely painful reaction on my eyes. I plan on repurchasing. * I use this product for daily use. It is lightweight and keeps your face clear and oil free. * i'm so glad i found this sunscreen! beginning with the biggest pros for me- i've seen no new breakouts, doesn't pill, and feels like nothing on my skin. i really hate when i can feel an spf on my face but with this product my skin feels light and clean. pilling and clinging to dry patches is very annoying and i've noticed ZERO pilling/exaggerating of dry patches. 

the few cons i have are very nitpicky- fairly strong smell and isn't mattifying. the smell is almost floral but mostly is just a normal sunscreen smell, which isnt a huge deal to me but might be too much for those sensitive to fragrance. i also wouldn't consider this a mattifying products which i actually prefer. theres little to no added shine but again, not very mattifying.

overall i'm so glad i finally found an spf that works on my skin! * Considering I have very oily skin, this didnt moisturize my skin at all. I had to use it as a straight up sunscreen over my regular moisturizer which defeated the purpose for me. It was defined mattifying to the point of drying. * I do my best to avoid sun exposure to my face, so I am always applying sunscreen. This works really well, it's not runny like some other suncreens for your face and I like the way it smells. I feel that it works really well and don't notice any redness or irritation eithet!"

If you have normal oily skin dont use this! * I usually use the 30 SPF version and it works great. I decided to try the hybrid and it's a mess. It's very runny and peels of as I tried to rub it in. * While this item was more expensive than most sunscreens, it was worth it. * Other reviews are being entirely to hard on this product. LOVE this sunscreen!  Yes it is thinner than the SPF 30 but it took 1 second to adjust how I apply it, it leaves a whitecast…if you DON'T rub it in which I do because that's whats supposed to be done with cream/lotions (right?🤔), I dont mind the smell I found it to be quite subtle, but someone else might (to each his own), overall for the price point this is an excellent mineral sunscreen. * I love this sunscreen. I appreciate the fluidity, it makes it easier to apply. I'm on the lighter side and burn easily but I was outside in the Carolina sun for 4 hours without reapplication and didn't burn. * *My comment is after having used it for nearly 2 years without skin irritations,  zero burning,  zero breakouts, uncompensated, without biased to any other products, and designated for ALL skin tones. I'm multicultural and have melonated skin.

** The longest memoir version of a review below is what's worked for me, tips, and why I'm using it as a dollar-stretching multi-tasker for all skin. Recommended for all skin tones and ethnicities. It's one of FEW products that offers 50 SPF for both face AND body in a healthy, noncommogenic blend and has stayed reasonably affordable despite competitors. 

The Black Girl Magic Hybrid 50 SPF IS one of the best sunscreens EVER  - yes it does take a learning curve to dispense small amounts of the liquid-consistency lotion because of the packaging but DON'T let that deter you from such a healthy, full-coverage product. Best of both worlds, covering face and body easily and at a dope price, high SPF, and a little goes a loooooong way! Be patient.....

When you first apply this to your skin it should be the LAST step in whatever your personal process might be, depending on if you're toning, serums, and moisturizing you want to give those other steps at least 30 seconds to 1 minute to absorb into your skin. Then apply this SPF last. You will notice a white cast initially, but it has to process - just like all of us. Give it a minute to absorb into your skin and then look in the mirror because you're going to look and feel like a delicious rockstar  : )

I'm usually indoors throughout the workdays. I apply about a dime size on a reusable cloth face pad and gently swipe then dap over face and neck/breast and some of the top shoulder area - this helps me preserve the sunscreen and not overapply it. I know this is redundant but GENTLY apply/swipe/dab, not wiping or pulling the skin or product too aggressively or too quickly. Then use a little larger amount with hands if needing for allover coverage depending on the day/activities/clothing.

Let it absorb and then continue with your day . 

*Don't assume to apply this and then go about your day outside immediately - within 15 mins you should be about ready to go outside with this glow protection-factor - AFTER the white cast absorbs. 

Humbly put your pride and ego to the side when reapplying later in the day because the sunscreen needs to absorb into the skin again and then it becomes invisible.  If you're wanting a purely sheen/invisible look without the zest of glow, go to the bathroom until it absorbs 1st, or just ignore caring that others might notice that you're protecting your skin.. : ) ... and/or try the brand Supergoop Unseen - but downside on that is it's a smaller container, less SPF, more expensive, and a one or the other type of sunscreen whereas *Black Girl Magic Hybrid is quality AND value for both face AND body,  and keeps skin looking and feeling on point,  glowing,  healthy and protected, not clogging or masking feeling. WINNING! 

I suggest using Black Girl Magic Hybrid 50 at home before the day starts and trying the Supergoop Unseen as travel/on the go option for reapplying sunscreen throughout the day.  

Black Girl Magic Hybrid 50 sunscreen is for skin. All skin. Regardless of tone, shade, or hue, this sunscreen is a must have! 

Thanks for reading * The consistency is so loose and liquidy. I hate it! This one also leaves a white cast which to me defeats the purpose of its name. I usually buy the og one, but it was completely sold out. They need to work on the formula of this one."

I am thrilled to have found a tinted sunscreen that is gentle on my rosacea, doesn't sting the eyes, and absorbs well without leaving my face greasy. The finish it leaves on the skin is beautiful, providing a lovely, satin-like glow. It works exceptionally well even in the summer heat. I've tried several sunscreens before, but this one stands out for its comfort and effectiveness. Definitely the best one I've tried so far! * my go to tinted face sunscreen. very light coverage but blends with many skin tones. always has protected my skin and has never broken me out * I have sensitive skin with rosacea and this is doesn't bother my skin.  The tint is just a hint if color for me (I'm light to med complextion).  I look glowy and dewy.  Its great when don't want to wear foundation.  Mineral sunscreen is so hard to find without the white cast.  This has none of it.  It's definatelu worth a try.  This is my go to sunscreen from now on. * Needed a sunscreen like this. They are either changing the packaging or changing the other formula of another of their sunscreens so I tried this one, it's literally perfect.  I love the skin tint I feel so confident with it and nothing else on, the redness correcting is perfect * Sodium Benzoate is used as a preservative to prevent food from molding. In this form it is safe, however, scientists have shown that negative side-effects occur when it is mixed with Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C). Their studies indicate that it then turns into Benzene, a known carcinogen * Im someone who suffers from acne scars :/ although this product doesnt exactly cover up my acne scars, it really makes the appearance look lighter (if I wanted to cover up my acne scars I'd be wearing a full coverage foundation) I think it's just a plus that it does make my acne scars look less severe!! 

This product doesnt burn my eyes and it really blends seamlessly into my skin. After awhile i do get oily BUT i am an oily skinned girl. Im also light - med skin tone so i cant say that yes or no that this blends in the best with other skin tones. It blends with mine! 

Honestly my go to sunscreen when i want a little bit of something but dont feel like layering moisturizer, sunscreen, and skin tint. It also doesnt pill up! (For me at least! I found as long as im not layering a lot of products underneath it doesnt pill. I found when layering actives such as benzoyl peroxide+clindamycin creme under it does pill up and get patchy.) * The color match was fine, but this sunscreen was way too drying for my sensitive skin. Alas, it's going back."

The serum will not melt into your skin. Then if you put makeup on over it, the makeup will not apply evenly and the makeup sits on top of your pores and fine lines and accentuates them! This serum also was not as greaseless as I had hoped. It was a little greasy. So I don't recommend this serum at all. The sunblock in it is 17% Zinc Oxide. That is most likely the reason it never melts into your skin. The price is also very expensive. * It blends into the skin without any white cast but I feel it doesn't get absorbed easily, feels greasy and uncomfirtable on my skin. I can't get past the fact that it feels tacky on the skin for such a long time. For the price point, I'm sure there are much better product out there . * sensitive enough on eczema prone skin during the summer time! * Had high hopes but, after using the full bottle, I did not see any ""Correct""ing benefit. BThey should take this word out of the name, it is misleading.  Also it smells a bit unpleasant which mostly dissipates.
It did give me sun protection but I can get that from a much less expensive product.
Overall a disappointment. * I am a very tan latina who has gone through tons of sunscreen trying to find one with no white cast that actually gives protection. While the price point is steep, it is 100% worth it. You can't go wrong with any of Murad's sunscreens. Love this more than the hydrating purple one because that one smells awful! * Product causes white casting. * This is the first sunscreen I have used that is in the texture of a serum. I like that because it has the consistency of a serum it is not very thick and applies easily. I didn't think this felt greasy but I have used many mineral sunscreens and am used to the way they wear. If you are not you may not like the way it feels on the skin. I felt this product absorbed well and didn't just sit on top of my skin."

I would also add that it has a very oily finish, so if you have oily or combo skin, this likely isn't for you. * I've used this through a couple of bottles. My skin takes time to adjust to products (hence why the couple of bottles). 

I love that it is cruelty free and has vegan collagen. I love that it has SPF 30, a must for me, BUT it smells like sunscreen. It is definitely moisturizing, I don't have an issue with dry skin, BUT it's rather greasy. My daughter has even commented that my face is really greasy when I wear it (not really the vibe I'm going for). The chemicals burn my eyes as the day goes on. If I even wipe my eyes, it takes me minutes to wipe away whatever traces of this moisturizer is around my eyes. If I regularly wore makeup, this would be extra problematic. If you wear contacts, I do not recommend this. Imagine that burning getting caught up under your contacts.

I really, really wanted to love this because I didn't want to go through having my skin adjust to a new product, but I can't justify it based on it being a habit. * As mentioned by others, this would be more accurately described as ""SPF 30 sunscreen with collagen."" Smells exactly like a normal drugstore sunscreen. It's light and doesn't feel too greasy (but there is still a bit of that feeling). Overall it's ok * Just finished my bottle and ordered another one.  I have sensitive, adult cystic acne, 44 yr old skin that is in the normal to dry stage. This product:
1) has a sunscreen like feel to it when you first apply it, then it fades away
2) has a great glass bottle that you can get ALL of the product out of!
3) Spreads well- at little goes a long way- to much will make it sticky and it won't dry down fast
4) plays well with Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid serum and PUR love your selfie foundation. * I'm getting older, and my skin is changing, and I hate it. My old favorite daily moisturizer/SPF by No. 7 started making me breakout after years of no problems, so I had to search for something new. All the others I tried that claimed to not clog pores also happened to be too drying for my slightly oily but aging but still acne prone and also kinda dehydrated skin (ugh). But the moisture level of this Goldilocks cream is just right. If you have dry or slightly dry skin you will probably like it, if you are 40+ you will probably like it, if you're young and have oily skin you might NOT like it because it is not a light liquid, it's definitely a thick-ish cream. I can tell the fragrance they were trying for was *floral* but it leans more chemical, although it disappears in a minute or two. After application the skin feels moist, but not greasy. Makeup applies perfectly over it with no pilling at all. I somehow manage to not look shiny over the course of the day, which is practically miraculous. It doesn't seem to make me break out, as I've been using it for several weeks with no notable flares. I am relieved to have found my new favorite! * i like how this spf does not leave a white cast like other spfs. Plumped my skin right up and gave it a nice silky glow. * Love the fact its a moisturizer and has spf. Its easy to use and dont need as much since it spreads easily on your skin. I can feel it last for a good amount of time too"

Literally so white and even with 5 minutes of rubbing it into your skin, your skin is grey with stripes of whote because it does not absorb. I have medium tan skin and it makes me look ill. Save your money! * Used this on a trip to Hawaii (this is a reef safe sunscreen) - my kids used it when they went snorkeling. It does leave a white cast on skin, but that is to be expected considering the active ingredients and the high SPF. They came back from the snorkeling trip with a nice tan (we have naturally olive skin, so we tan even with sunscreen) and no burns. I use this regularly on my face to boost the SPF from my daytime moisturizer. It does not feel greasy and it doesn't appear shiny at all. There is an almost imperceptible (not visible in photographs) white cast, but I can live with that. I also use it on the backs of my hands and arms to prevent a ""car tan"" and it has worked well for that so far. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and I would buy it again. * Do not buy! I'm actually headed to Ulta right now to return this. It'll leave a white cast on any skin tone! And it doesn't blend into the skin no matter how much you rub it in. It's also really dry feeling. Skip this product all together.! * I gave this product one star because it does protect from the sun. But I hated everything else about it. It does not absorb it just sits on top of the skin and it's so white. It's very thick and took a long time to apply. It gets all over everything. Not just your clothes, but anything else you touch or bump into. And it is just as difficult to remove from your skin at the end of the day. I threw this product away after using it a few times. * This is the worst sunscreen I have ever tried. It has a weird, gritty texture and is so hard to rub into the skin. It's also super thick and leaves a very noticable white cast. * A truly reef-safe sunscreen for very, sensitive skin that did not leave a white cast on my dark complexion. It can get white when wet but goes away quickly as you dry. I loved it and it kept my skin soft."

They're all mid or below. This sunscreen is basically a liquid. I was expecting more of a lotion type of formula. It is very runny, so when you go to dispense product, be careful and don't squeeze- otherwise you'll make a mess. * IT ACTUALLY WORKS ON ALL SKIN TONES AND COLORS.
I LOVE this sunscreen it is moisturizing while providing sun protection and a BEATIFUL GLOW. It works well under makeup also. I do recommend applying an actual moisturizer on with it because it works as dew drops. It provides great protection.
I rate it 10/10. * I want to give this 5 star, however when I use it, I find I tend to break out a little. Other than that, I absolutely love it. Gives a beautiful glow and protects really well. This has usually been my go-to for sunscreen when we go to the water park, beach, pool or just days I don't want to wear makeup. I will be looking around for other products to try to avoid getting clogged pores that causes the breakouts but I still love this lotion. * I enjoyed the glow this sunscreen gave me, it went on smoothly, and felt ligtht on my skin. 
It did cause a lot of eye irritation after a few hours of wear, so I dont wear it past my eyes. The product is very watery, and it does spill everytime I apply it. 

I did love this as subscreen for mu arms and neck. * Ok, so when I tried this on my face I got a burning sensation after an hour or so. I initially thought it was something else until I realized it only happened when I used the glow 30. It's weird because I'm not allergic to anything in the ingredients so I'm not sure why I'm sensitive to it. So I almost threw this out, when I decided to try it on my arms and legs so that I wouldn't waste any product and OH. MY. GOD. Literally the best glowy body sunscreen ever. It's not glittery and doesn't look like a spray tan. It just gives the most beautiful natural glow with a touch added coverage. I don't get a reaction to it on my body like I do on my face. Note though that I'm very pale so this might not work on deep skin tones. It's also a very runny product so be careful when opening it and squeezing it out because you actually don't need to really squeeze it, the product will just flow right out. It's kind of annoying but also adds to the benefits of it being good for the body because it means that you need to use less product, so even though it's packaged for the face it provides enough product for the body. Also, I've worn this on my college campus all day and it didn't seem to come off until I took a shower, and it didn't stain or rub off on my clothes! The glow lasted all day without it feeling greasy or leaving any residue on fabrics, so long as I'm careful not to get it on my neckline when I'm applying it. Once it sets on the skin it doesn't budge. I initially bought this from Wegman's on clearance but I'm now buying two more bottles from Ulta for the Summer. * this sunscreen is so amazing for when you want a glowy finish! it wears well under makeup and works wonderfully! * I am in the irritated retinol stage, hoping to be over the hump soon. But in the meantime this has been amazing all my tinted moisturizers or foundation look parch ans dry from the retinol. It look so pretty!"

I can throw everything but the kitchen sink at my skin when it comes to exfoliating and my skin takes it beautifully. I used this product daily for about a month and started to see some irritation. Thought it was maybe the change in seasons or my other actives. I cut back on those products and the irritation got worse. Started to look like a rash / dermatitis thats caused by heavy moisturizers. Didnt even think thats it was the sunscreen until it was literally the only ""new"" product on my face. Went back to look at the product more closely. Contains coconut oil, which as an acne prone girly, I know this is very comedogenic / clogs pores / causes dermatitis. Sad because I liked everything else about the product- price, packaging, consistency, absorption, efficacy. Just doesn't work for my skin. 😞 * I started using this sunscreen and I genuinely do like the way it feels on my face and has a pleasent scent! It does protect well considering I was outside for hours and my face did not burned however, if it got into my eyes (just from me rubbing or from sweating) and it would continuously keep burning my eyes. 

I really want to like it however, I may switch back to bare republic mineral sunscreen since I had no issue with that."

It leaves a beautiful glow and deeply hydrates but again, not for oily skin or if you leave in hot weather.Too heavy for a day cream * I got this product with high hopes. It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy.

I paid for it with my hard earned money, so my review is legitimate. I like this suscreen! I was previously using Murad's mineral SPF religiously, but that came with a more expensive price tag so I figured I'd give this one a try. I like this one better. While it does not have titanium dioxide like the Murad, it does have a higher concentration of zinc. I like the texture, consistency and glowy effect of this product. The fragrance is a bit much and can be overwhelming when first applied. I would (and will) repurchase. * This product applies well, has excellent ingredients for my preferences. The pull off cap needs a grip of some sort. The consistency and tint are great for me. It is wet though. It goes on wet feeling and stays wet. Not like an oil. * I live in Florida and am obsessed with sunscreen year round.  I am a believer yhat its the most important part of any skincare routine. I try anything new that cones put and have my favorites for different scenarios.  But, this, by kate sommerville is my new overall favorite.  Its a fluid like cream with a slight tint but I wouldn't consider it tinted.  It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any residue.  It made my skin glow, hence the illuminating.  Its perfection with a 50 spf."

I am allergic to anything ""minty"" (menthol or similar). I held my breath when I put it on and didn't realize until after applying that I'm allergic to this product. I spent the next couple days sick as a result. * I don't usually leave reviews, but this stuff is so awful that I have to. This is the oiliest greasiest awful spray I have ever used. Stick to Coola's SPF setting spray. This will take your makeup off as soon as you spray it on. * Its a little greasy when its first put on. To me (30+ skin) it finishes okay once its dry. make sure to close your eyes tight because it BURNS. It also has an unnecessarily stong spearmint smell. I honestly dont think ill be buying this again. * Horrible smell * I love the glow it gives for a minute but it burns way to much. * I've used this, and other setting sprays as well, but Ulta's brand will always be my favorite.

Does not go away if you blend either * A little smaller than I expected, but still a great product nonetheless. It has a nice, light scent to it that I assume is from the papaya. I keep this in my purse as my hand sunscreen for when I'm driving and the sun is creeping in through my windows. * This is part of my sunscreen arsenal when I know I'll be in the sun all day sweating. The coverage feels 100%, but it can be a little masking with a white cast. You will still need to blend it a bit with your fingers. It also works great with dry skin and smells wonderful. * I am allergic to a lot of chemicals on the face and this is the perfect sunscreen for me. Rubs in really nicely, super smooth, and leaves less of a white cast than other zinc sunscreens. Big fan!"

I have purchased this 3 times (for myself and family), and all 3 times the bottle has leaked all over my bag, and wasted money. Get the lotion and save your money. * I sprayed this on my face before driving home from work and within 20 minutes my eyes were stinging and burning. Im guessing it migrated into my eyes. Also the coconut fragrance lingers on your face for a long time. Really disappoint overall and cant wait for my eyes to stop burning. * It's a light mist that does feels slightly sunscreeny- but not too much that it turns me away from it. I have oily skin and I hate using face spf for that reason so I wanted to try this instead. I like the light feel and it didn't irritate my skin. * I like that it doesn't have alcohol or a smell like the setting spray version but it is pretty oily when applied. Also wish the SPF was higher. I went though the bottle quick since I kept reapplying before I noticed how oily it made me. It would be great for dry skin girlies. * I think there are better spray sunscreens on the market for a better price. I'm really debating on returning this. I've used it three times, and each time I'm happy with the glow, but it very quickly turns to grease and my makeup slides off. I think for the price, you're better off getting something else. Also, the packaging is pretty but it's not practical. I bought this to put in my pool bag and my hiking pack, but it's glass packaging… I get making sustainable packaging but this isn't practical for what I'm using it for. * Maybe I got a bad bottle but the spritzer clogged up to spray a narrow, hard stream. It was bad news when I sprayed it and it hit me in the eye! * I spray this everyday after my normal skin care and makeup routine. It has a light coconut scent that smells wonderful. I reapply throughout the day to keep feeling fresh and add protection to my skin."

I continue to use it because, although the smell is terrible, the formula remains effective and keeps me from burning in intense sun and it's modestly priced for an oil free sunscreen that's high in SPF protection. That's what keeps me coming back. 
Keep in mind, this is a sunscreen lotion and not advertised to be a daily moisturizer. I use another SPF product by the same brand for daily use. I only apply this product prior to outdoor activities. * This is my tride and true. It looks fabuslous on its own and underneath makeup. There is a slight white cast that is eliminated with enough blending. I also notice it helps lessen the amount of sweat thats produced on my face. I workout everyday in an unconditioned gym in the south, need i say more?

This is it * I hate this sunscreen. I thought it would have a flawless finish like all the korean chemical sunscreens I like. It leaves a white cast on my face as if it were a mineral sunscreen and does not completely rub in no matter how much I work it in. And then it does not dry fully either, it just sits on top of skin. Surprisingly, it doesnt make foundation pill, so that gets a star. I will not repurchase. * I didnt get a sunburn but it is very hard to rub in so you need to apply alot of product. * I used the old version for years and it was nearly perfect; hydrating, easily spread, and non irritating. The new version takes a lot of work to spread in, leaves a white cast on my skin(nc45), clings to hairs, and isn't hydrating enough. * I've tried a few sport sunscreens and this is one of my favorites. I wear it everyday before my workouts to protect my skin outdoors and indoors from harmful UVA/UVB rays. I sweat a lot and it doesn't burn or sting my eyes which is a plus. One of the cons I have to note for others is, it is a little bit thick and greasy like a lot of sunscreens, but that doesn't really bother me personally. * Leaves you with a white cast after trying to rub it in."

I usually stick with Asian sunscreens as they have exceptionally elegant lightweight formulas with filters far more advanced than those you can find in the US. I got a sample of this, however, and was genuinely surprised by the formula and how it felt on the skin. For reference, I have oily-combination skin, so a light SPF is a must. This sunscreen definitely fit its description of a gel serum- I would say that's definitely how it felt going on (maybe a tad bit more of a gel cream, but still quite light, regardless), and in my experience, it sinks in quite quickly while still leaving the skin feeling the skin hydrated and moisturized. I don't typically use moisturizer when I use this, but that's just what works for my skin personally. I have very sensitive eyes and this also did not sting my eyes at all when applied around my eye area, which is a huge plus for me as that can turn me off from a sunscreen completely. Different things work differently for everyone so I would still recommend getting a sample and trying before spending this much on a sunscreen, especially as there are lots of incredible SPFs that are MUCH more affordable, but finding a sunscreen thats actually enjoyable to use can be extremely hard so I definitely appreciate finding one (a US sunscreen, at that) that feels this nice and would absolutely recommend.

***This was purchased with my own money. This is NOT a sponsored review in any way and all opinions are my own. * I'm always on the hunt for a sunscreen for my face that doesn't feel sticky and hot.  This one isn't quite the naked feel I'd like, but I think it's the best I've found so far.  Unfortunately the cap won't come off so I have to screw off the top to access the product.  I'm assuming there's a pump under the cap which would really be convenient, but I'm going to have to pour the product into my hand.  Disappointed in this defect for the price of the product. * I love that this doesn't smell like sunscreen.  It is light for this oily skin girl, doesn't make me oilier.  Small bottle."

I put it on expecting it to be better than my Neutrogena one but it is 10 TIMES WORSE. My legs look white as a ghost. BUY ANOTHER SUNSCREEN!!! * Super greasy and leaves a really bad white cast! * I don't why so many people hate this.  It is my holy grail mineral sunscreen.  It works and doesn't flare my rosecea or excema.

1) It is fragrance free.  It doesn't smell at all. I am picky - -and I noticed no smell. 

2) Mineral high spf — no irritating chemicals

3) oil free and noncomodogenic

4) it works

5) gluten free - I am celiac and get a rash and excema from topical or oral gluten

5) it doesn't make my skin burn or itch like all of the chemical sunscreens

6) yes, it leaves a whitish cast on my light olive skin.  So, after applying, after a few minutes, I brush on a light bit of MAC Studio Fix in my usual NC20.  Yes, I am a bit shiny, but I have oily skin and am shiny 24/7 regardless

So, this is my holy grail sunscreen.  Yay!  I have to wear it because I have developed hyperpigmentation and have to use trentinion at night and The Ordinary Niacinamide everyday. * Not brown skin friendly. It least major white cast like I look so ashy :( * I purchased this while on vacation, when I realized I had forgotten to pack my sunscreen. Ulta was out of my usual brand and I purchased this instead because it was just about all that was left. Now I know why - it leaves your skin super white. * This is for lifeguards in the 70s protecting their nose. It does not absorb and whitecast is an understatement * cera ve products are great, but not this one. i should have realized how low the rating was for this. anyways this sunscreen left my legs WHITE. it did not absorb into my skin and i even took a shower the next day and it didn't dare to get off. i do not recommend this."

I was looking forward to trying the coral shade the most. Just wish the set was actually the colors advertised! I think the formula is decent, but a little overpriced. * I really like thses.  They smell so good, like mint.
Wish they were available in store. * First off I'd like to say that this is the first time I've tried a tinted SPF lip balm! And I really like what I've tried so far! I've tried these for about 10 days and I really like how they feel on my lips. They are very moisturizing, silk texture and made in such pretty colors! My favorite is the Firecracker color. I like how nicely it glides on and doesn't feel cakey nor weighed down. I love the fact that these has SPF and I don't have to worry when I'm swimming at the pool if I get dried out lips. Also love the fact that this is organic, Vegan, and made with natural ingredient's and safe for the earth. Such high quality products and I'd love to test out other lip balm colors and also try other COOLA products! Perfect for the beach! * First off, I've only been using these for about 5 days and I'm absolutely OBSESSED. I love that it comes in 3 different shades and flavors but mainly the variety!

One of the first things I noticed about the lip sunscreen is how well it works, some products it takes a few days of using it for the effects to really work but this worked immediately, usually my lips crack and dry out depending how long I'm outside but this actually hydrated and protected them from cracking or drying out. One of the other things I loved was the fact you can barely even tell your wearing it! It doesn't feel weird or oily or cakey! And the other thing I loved was the fact it came with 3 different flavors! I highly recommend this product for anyone wanting the perfect go to lip sunscreen!!

This review was collected as part of a promotion. * This lippie trio is a must-have in your vacation bag! To say I'm obsessed is an understatement. I have fair skin and I try to avoid sun exposure as much as possible. (I promise I'm not a vampire.) That being said, I love it when my makeup doubles as my extra sun protection! I was so excited to try these tinted lip balms out, and I am so glad I did! The color payoff for these lip balms is pretty amazing. You can build up the coverage or sheer them out. They all have a different scent to each color, and each one smells great. I did also experiment with using the lip balms as a blush and I was extremely pleased with the results. My favorite shade out of the pack has to be 'Summer Crush' due to its vibrant color. If you're a lip balm girlie, you are going to need these if you are out in the sun. This review was collected as part of a promotion * The coolas travel mineral lip trio was just perfection! Every color was beautiful and the packaging was spot on! These lippies provide spf 30, is definitely 40 mins water resistant and glides on like a charm! I went away for the weekend and the hotel I was staying at had a pool where I decided to put them through the  water resistant test. Let me tell you it did not rub off at all! Every lippie has a different name and beautiful crafted smell that definitely goes with the name. The packaging said to apply 15 mins before sun exposure which I did and It held through the whole day with a second reapplication because the sun was really harsh that day. I also forgot to bring blush and I used the firecrackers lippie on my cheeks and it gave me a natural beachy cheeky glow. Blended in my cheeks so seemingly. I love what the brands stands for and how the ingredients are great! * COOLA's Organic Lip Sunscreen with a 30 SPF comes in 3 different shade and flavors. These are organic and vegan. I like that It shields my lips from both UVA and UVB rays, preventing sunburn. I spend most of my free time gardening and these have been a life saver for my lips. I love how compact the tube is which makes it easier to carry around in my small crossbody bag. These glide easily and not chalky at all compared to other products I've used. I really like that these provide a subtle amount of tint, it's more of a natural tint. These are perfect for when you want to add a subtle amount of color without having to go all out. Each color is different and perfect for when I want to change it up. I was surprised with the scent and flavor, it's not overpowering. Firecracker is actually my go to right now. My one complaint is that I wished these were more moisturizing. These are perfect for summer! I can't wait to take these to the beach with me. I recommend 100%"

I have UBER SENSITIVE SKIN that can be prone to breakouts with the majority of products.  This is everything it says and more!  Weightless, blends beautifully and my skin doesn't freak whatsoever!  Great product line! * I love this weightless sunscreen.  It's light and does not have the traditional sunscreen smell.  Blends very well with make up. * omg i have been looking for a mineral sunscreen that doesnt leave me looking like a ghost (with a whitecast) forEVER!!! This is my favorite thing in the world. I use this by itself on no makeup days but it works extremely well with all of my different foundations on top!! Pls never discontinue this💕💕 * I love the way this product feels and how it looks on my skin. It doesnt pill or dry out my already dry skin. However, I won't buy again because it burns if i put it anywhere near my eyes. Also washing my face with it on is a nightmare because its impossible to keep it completely away from my eyes. So, if your eyes/skin are sensitive i would stay away. * I love this sunscreen. It doesn't make me oily, break out, or flare my eczema. I can easily apply the necessary amount of sunscreen without feeling like my skin is suffocating. The formula is very thin and almost feels like a serum. It absorbs within a few minutes. This sunscreen doesn't have silicones, so it will pill if worn on top of products with silicones. I've worn it with a moisturizer containing silicones and it pilled badly. I currently wear it with a silicone free moisturizer and it does not pill whatsoever. It has a beautiful tint and gives a nice, no makeup look. My skin isn't smooth at all and this sunscreen helps me feel a little bit more confident."

I've been on the hunt for a sunscreen that doesn't exacerbate any one of these issues. I don't use mineral sunscreens because they don't agree with my dry skin. This sunscreen is almost perfect. It doesn't burn my skin, it doesn't cause any skin flushing, it's hydrating, it doesn't pill, it doesn't break me out. Unfortunately it caused my eyes to sting horribly throughout the day. I really loved this sunscreen at first, and I was so disappointed. I'll continue to use it as a body sunscreen though."

I live in hot humid Tampa Florida and I wanted to switch to a mineral based spf. This is an excellent product that I've repurchased 10 times now and will continue to repurchase. Great! * I do not know what magic they put in this, but they cracked the code. I am a medium skinned black woman and there is no white caste, even after working out for an hour! Also, it is so comfortable, it does not feel like you are wearing anything AND it is very moisturizing.  I could not stop touching my face. 
This version is better than the non sweatproof version and the best mineral sunscreen I have ever tried, and I have tried a lot. * This is perfect for your outdoor activities--high SPF , water/sweat resistant with very minimal white cast for a zinc-only sunscreen at that high SPF (give it a little time for the slight white to dissipate-note however that i am fairly pale). I also use this on my neck and chest for everyday wear because it doesnt get ""orange"" tint on my collars and 
clothing like my everyday tinted spf does. It feels moisturizing in the skin. It is very different from kinships spf 30 product although I Highly recommend you try both!! * first one suits my sensitive skin, no more irritation and watery eyes due to sunscreen * I love the other Kinship SPF so I thought I'd give this one a try since it's ""water resistant"" and SPF60. I don't see HOW this is water resistant because it never sets and its continuously greasy, on top of that my skin STILL managed to dry out two hours after I've applied it. It rubs off into everything and if you touch your face at any point in the day (I've worn it for 6+ hours) it moves and gets into everything. I've almost finished the whole tube thinking maybe it's user error... it could still possibly be the case. I'm 30 with rosacea, combination dry skin with hormonal breaks out and a thyroid condition that tends to dry my skin and hair out.. I wanted to like this sunscreen but it's a big no. I can't make it work, I've tried it alone, with moisturizer, under makeup, with serum only. I don't feel protected when I wear this sunscreen. It's also got this iridescence to it that at first I thought I would like but it just makes you look like *shiny* vampire. * After using the kinship self reflect spf 30 for several months, this sunscreen is definately my preference over the self reflect. This sunscreen has a very natural satin finish and is very hyrdating without being greasy, while the self reflect spf 30 has a dewy finish and is more lightweight. It takes about 5 minute after application for it to absorb and the cast to disappear. The long term benefits for my very sensitive combo skin have been amazing. The keratosis bumps on my cheeks have completely disappeared and this is the only product I have change in my routine. It has a very subtle vanilla scent that disapears shortly after application. Also the cast is hardly noticable on pale-medium skin. My friend with dark skin borrowed some and said that even though there was a slight white cast for her, it was surprisingly subtle given how high spf it is. This sunscreen has replaced my foundation at this point because  texture of my skin has improved so much since using it. I wish kinship made a body sunscreen like this. Kinship is a solid clean skincare brand and most of my products are from kinship since they are only of the few brands that cause irritation for me. If you have sensitive combo skin I would especially recommend this brand. * After using the kinship self reflect spf 30 for several months, this sunscreen is definately my preference over the self reflect.

Some of the reviews mention a smell but I don't smell anything personally. * It doesn't matter how great this moisturizer feels on your skin because the smell is so bad you will be forced to clean it off.

At first it was hydrating without excess oils & silicones but hours later my skin would feel dry again, maybe due to the Hyaluronic Acid in this. The twist bottle also opens on its own and spilled all over my drawer. * I have stuffled looking for an amazing sunscreen that goes well with extremely sensitive skin and dry skin and is SPF50. I experience no stinging, tingly, burning, or redness on my face. The price is definitely worth purchasing and rebuying.

Not many products, including sunscreen, break me out, but the ones that do, REALLY mess me up. This sunscreen broke me out terribly. Not all over the face, but a few cystic blemishes, including one of my nose. I'm still dealing with the scarring from that :( The scent on this is VERY strong. I am not sensitive to scents at all. I don't care when products are scented, but there is no need for it be this strongly scented. What were they thinking? 

I bought this during the beauty days sale so I will keep it and use it on my neck and chest for the anti-aging benefits, but if you are breakout prone from sunscreens, be very careful with this one. * My first time trying out this face sunscreen and it feels nothing like all the others I've tried and used under makeup! This is veil like, smooth application…. BUT!!! The scent! The scent is STRONG and it does not go away even after you applying foundation or bb cream… I really wanted to love this product because of the peptides but im disappointed I will not be using it as I wanted due to the smell. Side note the description does indicate there is a floral scent to it (i missed reading that part) I agree it is a floral scent except it is strong! * I like how this goes on and the potential benefits, however, it irritates my rosacea and makes me redder. * When I first used it, I loved the cosmetic elegance and how it feels on my skin. Yes, like what everyone was saying, the fragrance is so strong. I typically do not have any reaction to any active ingredients. I use VC, VA, anything with no problem. I had my first allergic reaction three weeks ago. I was red, a bit swollen, very itchy from face to neck. I thought other new products I just opened and used caused it, and at that time i was using other sunscreen for sensitive skin. Two weeks ago I started using this again on a day I ate a lot of seafood, so I thought it was the seafood gave me the same reaction. Now I was totally healed and used this sunscreen for the third times, and again my entire face look like monster. I wonder what exact ingredient gave me allergy. * Would have been okay, the scent is strong, but this stung my eyes after about an hour. * This is a great product, but they kind of ruined it with a SUPER strong fragrance. I don't dislike the fragrance itself, it actually smells okay (to me it smells like those scentsicles you put in your artificial  christmas tree to make it smell real), but it is SO super strong, it's all I can smell all day. Like, even over the actual perfume I put on, this smells stronger. So I'm docking a star for that. Otherwise, it is matte, non-greasy (and I have extremely oily skin), doesn't make me get super greasy over the course of the day, and moisturizes well enough that I don't need a separate moisturizer or even eye cream underneath. I haven't noticed any anti-aging effects yet but I've only been using it for a few weeks. It's kind of expensive, but not outrageously so. I like the formula so I'm going to use up the tube, but because of the fragrance I probably won't repurchase unless I get used to it enough that it stops bothering me. * I've been in the beauty industry for over 12 years so tried A LOT of products including sunscreen. This one from Vichy was really at the top. 

I live in Texas and try to use sunscreen everyday. The product is non-sticky, absorbs quickly with no white film. It also has a very appealing, skincare smell. My makeup went over the sunscreen very easily.  

While the number one reason I use sunscreen is for the SPF protection all the extra goodies, like Vitamin C, really made me feel good about using it on my skin

The packaging is really sleek but more importantly the dispenser is great. Nice amount and very smooth. Sunscreen tubes can get really messy, and this one does not. 

This one is a keeper! Full disclosure I got this product through Stellar Product Testing Panel but fully stand by my review."

This was a winner. The only down side is the smell but worth the 5 seconds. * It does produce a glow but needs higher SPF especially during peak Florida summer * I usually don't leave reviews. But this smell is terrible...it literally smells like trash * This product has such great reviews and I had high hopes as a mineral sunscreen superuser. But it didnt live up to the hype- the smell is gross as other people mentioned and it left my skin greasy. Minimal white cast at least but still not my fave. * I personally am not a fan of how this product looks on my skin and how it feels. I've been using it daily for the past month or so since I got it to really give this product a shot but it's not it. I dont understand the ""glow"" everyone else is talking about but on my skin freshly after washing and everything it is extremely greasy and stays like that all day. I will give it credit for not leaving much of a white cast, easily blending into the skin, and looking nice under makeup but the thick greasy feeling I can't get over. My skin is on the dryer side if that means anything to anyone. Also if I go out on a really nice sunny day right after applying my face still burns!?!?!?! so not very sheilding. For me it is not worth the money or time. * I am on probably my fourth or fifth bottle of this. I have very dry skin so some might find it a little too dewy looking but I love it. No white cast. Looks great under makeup. And I've never gotten sunburned. I can't imagine wanting to try anything else. * This was recommended to me by of the Utla Associates and she said, once I started using it I wouldn't go back to the one I was originally looking for and she was right."

If u sweat it will burn and irritate your eyes. * I have several Kiehl's products, I am in love with this brand and have the best skin I've had in a long time. Some things I deal w/ are being acne-prone, oily, rosacea and very sensitive. I've been doing some research on rosacea and have read that wearing a daily SPF can help with redness (among many other benefits, of course). I wanted to make sure I was getting a product from a brand I believe in because face sunscreen has been tricky for me. It's usually greasy and breaks me out significantly. I spent the extra money for this product and am unfortunately not very pleased. Like other comments, this product does ball up on the face. I find that I have to let my daily moisturizer sink in for AT LEAST 10 minutes before I can put on my sunscreen. And the more you try to massage it into the face, the more it will ball up. Other than that, my MAJOR complaint about this product is that after applying and about an hour after it's on my face, my skin starts to burn. It feels as though I have a mild sunburn across my entire face where you can feel the discomfort and burn. Again, I have sensitive skin and apparently it's just not reacting well with me. I've gone a few days without it and then tried it again and it is 100% this sunscreen. I'm out side of my return time so I'm stuck with it and really disappointed. I hate having to purchase products to figure out what works for my skin. Just writing this in-depth review for those of you with the same kind of skin as me...just to think twice. I will say, it does eventually sink into my skin and does not leave it greasy so that's a positive. * Since it is new to me, I am still trying to learn the right amount to apply. Too much (first try) and I had to blot it to make it just right. Second day, it was fine. It does not leave a white cast, definitely a pro. For its high quality, the price is reasonable!"

I absolutely love this spf tint - it looks natural on my skin, doesn't break me out, and it provides good sun protection. Please bring back all three shades of this! I miss being able to purchase it from here * Im a chemical sunscreen girl, but I kept seeing this sunscreen on social media so I decided go give it a try. 

PROS: 
- whipped texture 
- neutral tones 
- matte finish 
- absorbs oil
- good around the eye area 
- great for oily skin and/or summer
- 50+ SPF
- great for an active lifestyle

CONS: 
- feels a little heavy until it sets 

I do two layers of sunscreen: first a chemical sunscreen and then a mineral sunscreen. This is the best mineral sunscreen I've tried (Neutrogena, Cerave, MDSolarSciences, DMTLGY). * It's REALLY good, just not for someone with dry skin. I do like the texture, coverage, natural looking color, and the overall matte apperance but after 30 minutes it dries me out so bad. It would be good for humid days/someone with ""normal"" skin. * Over all good but very prone to rub off on clothing. Can't use near v neck and don't pull a top over your head. * The title says it all.  I purchased this, very excited to have found a sunscreen that is spf 50 and tinted AND acne safe.  Read some reviews saying it was not good at all, etc, great for oily skin.  This is why I was happily surpised that on my fair, dry skin it felt and looked great.  It was a little bit dark for my skin but it just made me look bronzed there wasn't any harshness or orange.  And it felt good on my skin under makeup (concealer and powder) all day.  Very suprised it also did not transfer.  Overall great product but I am suspicious of how it is spf 50 when the active ingredients do not indicate this at all. * Favorite daily sunscreen! It's been so hard for me to find one that doesn't irritate my skin! Plus, it's cruelty free, and reef friendly while not being too expensive for the large amount in one tube. It's an amazing product! * This is literally impossible to wash off! In the shower I washed my face FIVE times and I'm still seeing remnants of orange looking clay-like product on my face. I wouldnt reccomend to anyone unless you're into permanent makeup that dries orange and cakey."

Feels super heavy and oily on my dry skin and it peels when appliyng makeup. * It is now 2024 and we still have physical sunscreens that give darker skin women a white cast. The 12 dollar Neutrogena sunscreen will give you the same results. Save your money. * Another physical sunscreen that pictures black women but then isn't inclusive. It still gives whitecast on brown skin. Disappointed. * For me personally I found it to be watery and made my face look pasty white. Just like the kind you would get from normal skinscreen. Granted it does smell good and does the job of protecting my skin. * This spf is so lightweight and easy to wear under makeup. I have very oily skin and for a change a spf lotion didn't make it worse. I can't recommend this enough * The actual sunscreen is great but unusable because of the pump. Have to take off lid and try to fish out little globs of it to actually use. Too bad. How could their quality dept approve this packaging?! * I really like the product itself. Unfortunately it's a little too thick for the pump to dispense it. I have to take the lid off and use the pump stick to swipe it on my hands. Also, ran out after just a couple of weeks of use. Perhaps I got a bottle that had been returned and the previous person used a lot of the product?"

Im olive/medium tan, kund of like jessica albas skin tone, im not even that dark and this left a obvious white cast, my face had that purple hue, I looked awful. and the consistency is very thick, goopy and sticky and had this weird smell. I guess this would be fine to use for the body if you are not easily bothered by consistency or smell
. I prefer a sunscreen that feels like its not there * So i was in the market to looking into some new susncreens. I was very interested in this brand because its suited for sensitive skin. I decided on this SPF 50 cream. But the moment i felt it in my hands it was little thick to blend. I could tell by just feeling it on my face and seeing it move around that it was going to leave a noticeable residue. The scent was strong and gross. I wanna say it smelled like feet. So i returned it immediately. * Think this is a great sunscreen. Doesn't leave a white layer on your skin. Rubs in easy while protecting your skin. * I'm very disappointed, this is definitely Not Avene. The smell is ghastly and the texture is very dense much more the original Avene . * Smells awful but wears nicely with no white cast on fairer skin, however for deeper skin it would likely be unsuitable. You get a great amount for the price compared to equivalents from Supergoop, LRP, RoC, and others. * I can't believe this is an Avène product.  All their products are usually light, fresh, airy, & pleasant.  THIS ONE SMELLS TERRIBLE.  I CAN't stand it.  Smells old, musty, almost stale like & chemically.  Runny consistency.  I'm so DISAPPOINTED. I looked up reviews and I see I'm not the only one. (Thought maybe I got a bad bottle). Not sure what happened with this one. * Unlike most mineral sunscreens, this doesn't leave a white cast and isn't drying. However, it's pretty greasy even for my dry skin. I have to powder it down."

I love their tube tinted version in spf30, but this one knocks it out of the park.  it is runny, smooth, not greasy, blends well.  it's everything I. looking for in a sunscreen including the 20% zinc! * This is one of my favorite sunscreens, I'm very fair and the white cast really evens out my skin, it looks like I am wearing a tinted moisturizer. If you're super pale and in the market for a tinted moisturizer or sunscreen, I cannot recommend this enough! * I'm actually a fan of other Bliss products, but I have never experienced a whiter cast from sunscreen in my life. I could tell it would have one as it came out of the bottle, but wanted to trust the ""sheer"" claims. Will be returning. * I really like the light weight feel of this sunscreen, espeically for a mineral one. Although I find it pills under makeup and can cling to dry spots. So best for a no makeup day. * Iv tried a lot of sunscreens and I mean alot . Every single sunscreen I have used breaks me out even mineral ones. This sunscreen is by far the best one iv ever used its just amazing . * This sunscreen is so good. I've tried so many sunscreens and this one has everything I want. It actually absorbs, no white cast, it doesn't get into my eyes, and it's recyclable. * I need to stick to mineral sunscreens for my skin, so it's been hard for me to find one that leaves a minimal white cast, has high SPF, and is water-resistant. I just finished my first bottle of this, and so far I think it's one of the better ones I've tried! It doesn't irritate my skin, blends impressively for SPF 50, and doesn't feel heavy at all.

I have tan skin, so I usually wear a BB cream over this to cancel out the slight white cast this leaves. Note that it's a high SPF, untinted *mineral* sunscteen, so I cannot expect it to be fully clear. 

The one downside is that this seems to turn white in areas that get wet or have a lot of friction, such as under the bridge of your glasses. It can be rubbed back in very easily, but that's something to note."

It gives my skin a beautiful glow while providing strong SPF 29+ protection and 80-minute water resistance. I love that it uses non-nano zinc oxide and is free from harmful chemicals. The added antioxidants make my skin feel healthy and protected. Plus, the eco-friendly packaging is a huge bonus! I was gifted by madhippie * I recently tried the this sunscreen, and it's fantastic! The lightweight, non-greasy formula absorbs quickly, leaving no white residue. It provides excellent broad-spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays, making it perfect for daily use. Plus, it's water-resistant, which is great for outdoor activities. My skin feels moisturized and protected all day. Offered by madhippie * This luminizing spf has a slight shimmer that is very pretty under the sun or flashlight. When applying this sunscreen I find that you must start blending and rubbing it into the skin right away for a considerable amount of time to decrease the likelihood of white cast. Unfortunately, when too much product is applied it does leave a white cast on my skin tone and it clings to the dry patches on my face. Working in thin layers is optimal but it can be time consuming. This sunscreen has a cucumber scent which does not bother me personally and it mostly goes away after being absorbed. I like that this sunscreen is not extremely greasy feeling, it does not burn my eyes and that it was thought out and produced in an ethical manner, being reef safe, packaging made from recycled materials and with ingredients that support the skin, however, due to its 29 SPF rating I will wear it in the winter when the UV rays are significantly lower. 

This product was kindly gifted by madhippie for an honest review. * I have oily, acne-prone skin and I have a lot of requirements for sunscreen. The Luminizing Facial SPF by MadHippie exceeded my expectations.
It's all that I need. It provides me with 29+ UVA and UVB sun protection, without looking shiny or heavy. It has an enjoyable light texture with zinc oxide and extra benefits of antioxidants and niacinamide to protect and balance my skin.
I apply it in the morning before sun exposure and it lasts for several hours. It's also perfect for pool or lake day since it's water resistant for 2-3 hours.
It's my new favorite spring foundation! Highly recommended!
It was gifted by madhippie in exchange for writing an honest review. * I received this product complimentary from Herbivore Botanicals in exchange for my honest review.  A little bit goes a long way with this serum. It absorbs nicely with no noticeable residue.  It has helped shrink my acne bumps after just two applications.  It doesn't sting or cause any irritation. * Mad Hippie products always feel so gentle on the skin. This sunscreen is no different. It's starts nice and thick and rubs into the skin without a greasy finish or a trace of white. I love how it makes my cheekbones look sharper while it also adds an overall glow. Looks great, even on very fair skin! Gifted by MadHippie in exchange for my honest review. * The Luminizing Facial SPF is a fantastic addition to my skincare routine. It combines effective sun protection with a beautiful, glowy finish, making it perfect for no-makeup days or as a radiant base under makeup.

It's an efficient multitasking body  sunscreen that checks all my boxes. The tropical scent is immediately inviting, with the sweet notes of pineapple and honey melon giving off a refreshing, summery vibe that makes applying sunscreen feel less like a chore and more like a treat. The formula is impressively lightweight for an SPF 50, absorbing quickly into the skin without leaving any greasy residue or white cast. It feels more like a hydrating body lotion than a traditional sunscreen, which is a huge plus. The moisturizing aspect is particularly beneficial, keeping my skin soft and smooth even after hours in the sun. It's not water resistant so it's not ideal for sport activity or if you will be sweating a lot. This is also not a face sunscreen, I would describe it as the perfect daily body lotion sunscreen, which I found out also has anti-aging ingredients like Hemp seed oil and vitamin C. As a Floridian I can use this everyday before heading out and take with you to re apply during the day. This review was collected as part of a promotion * As a beauty expert with over two decades of experience, I'm delighted to share my insights on the Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon Herbal Body Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF 50 by HEMPZ.

HEMPZ, known for its hemp seed oil-based products, has a loyal following. Their commitment to cruelty-free, paraben-free, and vegan formulations aligns with modern beauty standards. The Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon Sunscreen stands out due to its unique scent and natural ingredients.

In comparison to other sunscreens, this one combines sun protection (SPF 50) with intense hydration. The 100% pure hemp seed oil ensures nourishment, while the tropical fragrance adds a delightful touch.

Incorporating into My Daily Routine:

I applied the sunscreen after my morning shower. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula absorbed quickly, leaving my skin soft and subtly scented. The SPF 50 protection gave me confidence during outdoor activities.

Final Thoughts:

HEMPZ's Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon Sunscreen combines efficacy, fragrance, and natural goodness. As a beauty expert, I'm impressed by its balance of protection and hydration. * I am a medical aesthetician and makeup artist with over 28 years of experience, so I am constantly educating my clients on the importance of skincare. 

Understandably,  SPF can be a pain, having to reapply often to maximize its effectiveness.  So, having a boost in its protection factor to 50, makes it even more worthwhile, in my opinion. 

HEMPZ has created a spectacular SPF that doesn't feel as heavy and cakey as most, too.  I love using it by the pool, because Texas sun is brutal, and being landlocked, the wonderful tropical scent transports me to a little oasis for a while.  

I definitely recommend this SPF for anyone serious about anti-aging and cancer prevention.

This review was collected as part of a promotion. * As a longtime Hempz fan (their lotions are the BEST!), I was thrilled when they launched this SPF 50. Let me tell you, it did NOT disappoint! Living in Texas, sunscreen is basically glued to my hand, but finding a non-greasy one can be a struggle. First off, the scent is AMAZING. Imagine a tropical vacation bottled up - sweet pineapple and honey melon perfection! It's lightweight and leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, and even a tad glowy. Plus, it goes on clear, so no white cast to worry about. Most importantly, this SPF 50 provides top-notch protection. Whether I'm poolside or just conquering my daily errands, I know my skin is shielded from those harsh UV rays. This sunscreen is seriously a summer essential, and I can't recommend it enough! * This summer I'm protecting and powering up my SPF! I have been obsessed with Hempz since spotting it in stores. I'm also a huge pineapple lover. Since first using this HEMPZ Sweet pineapple & honey melon body moisturizing SPF 50 I have been constantly receiving compliments on my scent. The texture itself is thick yet very smooth. The color of the sunscreen is white yet blends in a breeze, beautifully into my skin and adds a radiant finish to my body. The body cream SPF does dry down after a few minutes, then I'm ready to go out and have fun under the sun! This moisturizing body cream is my favorite product this summer because plump plus protected skin is a must. Everyone needs this sunscreen for their tropical adventures, I also do recommend re applying every two hours. This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I am so glad I was given the opportunity to try Hempz Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon Herbal Body Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF 50, being extremely fair skin toned I go through a lot of sunscreen. Especially this time of year. First the scent is lovely, I smell the pineapple right away and it gives major citrus vibes. Reminds me of sitting on the beach and sipping a refreshing drink. It's a nice thick formula but applies evenly and doesn't leave any white cast, just makes me a bit shiny. I just can't get over how good this smells. I want to keep reapplying because I want the scent to stay on me as long as possible. I think a 50spf was a great choice. My skin feels protected and hydrated. It reminds me of a lotion based on how good it smells and leaves my skin hydrated. *This review was collected as part of a promotion* * First off I just want to say how delicious this product smells. It gives such a dewy glowy feel to my skin and also makes my skin feel much more hydrated. I love how lightweight the product actuallh feels on the body and skin. Overall im really really happy with this product"

I really was hoping this would be a great, sheer, water resistant, mineral option for the summer.  However, if you use more than a smidge, this pills.  I tried on bare skin, over just a toner, under my full normal morning skin routine and it pills on application.  The texture is nice and not drying, and the cast is minimal, but present,  in comparison to many other mineral sunscreens.  I am aggressively neutral on the smell, its a little sunscreen-y, but it doesnt bother me.. Its neither strong, nor long lasting.  Also, its not a great amount.  I plan to use this up on my hands and ears. * I have mixed feelings about this sunscreen. One the one hand it dries down quickly and isnt sticky which I really appreicate. On the other hand it pills around my chin, neck, and eyebrows…which isnt the worst thing but is a little annoying. I mostly use this sunscreen on days where I need to run out of the house and need something that dries down quickly. * I love this sunscreen! As the name suggests it is very sheer and leaves my skin feeling moisturized without feeling sticky or greasy (a big ask for my oily skin). I will say, it does pill up under makeup if you start immediately after applying, but I give it 10 minutes or so and you should have no problem! * I used to use Biossance squalane mineral sunscreen until people started having reactions and it was pulled off the market. In my search for a comparable sunscreen, I found this one and honestly I think I like it even more! Feels very lightweight and moisturizing and blends in well! I like the glow it gives but I don't think it makes me look oily (I have combo-dry skin).My only wish is if they could make an SPF 50+ version! * I've been trying to convince myself that I really like this sunscreen for the last few weeks and I just don't think this is the product for me. Pills frequently regardless of what products I use underneath it, especially around the edge of my face. Won't end up finishing the bottle. * Only postives it has a nice gel texture and does not leave a not white cast. The smell reminds me of glue. It also pills a lot. * Upon arrival the product seem to be so extremely small for the price that I paid, it also looked like it had little to no product inside. Such a waste of money!! I was incredibly dissapointed and won't recomend to anyone, would give this zero stars if I could. I put 5 instead so everyone else could see this review bc I'm s

But this sunscreen is a no go for me. Its WAYYYYYY too dark, im naturally very pale but ive tried it both on my usual pale tone and tanned and either way its patchy and dark. It feels extremely heavy and gross on the skin and was a sensory nightmare. It dries super fast so its a pain to blend even if it was a closer shade to me. Spend the extra 20$ and get yourself some supergoop. * I love this product so much! I replaced my foundation and now use this for the summer. It makes my face look so healthy and gives it a nice glow. No sun burns either! * One of the worst tinted sunscreen I've tried. Tossed it after using it twice. It would matt down and stayed on looking greasy, not luminating but greasy looking! * I completely missed that this is tinted. I wish it said so on the front of the packaging. The tint looks horrible on me, which I would've known already. Otherwise, it's greasy and heavy. * Not a terrible product but not loving it for my fair skin. I'm the one usually buying the absolute lightest shade of foundation or skin products. I'm finding that the tint in this product looks pretty obvious on me and comes out a bit patchy. There will be spots or lines of color and overall just doesnt blend with my skin. It dries pretty quick so its hard to blend out well. Using moisturizer immediately before helps, but i feel like this waters down the product and probably limits its efficacy and sort of removes the color altogether. However, its probably a decent product for more medium tones."

Love it obsessed need more. * couldn't even try this product to see if it was any good because the pump wouldn't dispense any product and it was extremely annoying to try to scoop out the sunscreen with my finger. * This is the one sunscreen that doesn't break me out and it doesn't have a weird smell. I love that it has a pump but only 1 out of the 3 bottles I had gotten had a working pump. The tubing of the pump is too long and kinks up in the container, and I have to scoop it out with my fingers. It sounds like the defective pump is a big issue for many of us. Please fix this Earth Harbor! 

Nerding out-Many sunscreens claim SPF 30- each 1% zinc oxide = 1.6 SPF units. With 18.8% zinc oxide, this is truely SPF 30, protecting against 97% of UVB rays.

I will stay a loyal customer as long as they fix the pump issue 😊 * burns and itches my skin. pump doesn't work. * the sunscreen itself is fine but the pump on mine doesn't work so i have to scoop it out with my finger * Unfortunately, like others have said, I couldn't get the pump to even get any of the product out. I tried multiple times, thinking the product just had to work its way up the pump but, when I opened it, the tube for the pump was so bent around and around that there was no way the product could have made its way up. Additionally, the product is SO thick that I'm not sure how it even could have fit through the tiny tubing. Instead of scooping it all out, I'm planning to return. * Left my face feeling kind of greasy, but the biggest issue is how jacked the bottle is. When I opened it, I couldn't get the pump to work, and removed it to see if I could get it working. The tube leading from the pump into the bottle was bent into a zig-zag, rendering the pump completely useless. Now I have to scoop it out and use the bent tube like a tiny spatula. The moisturizer itself isn't anything special. Not sure I would buy again, especially if they're not cautious during the packing process to make sure the pump will actually work."

Separates horribly, clumps on my lips and hairline, strong white cast. * I religiously used the original Ultra Calming moisturizer from Aveeno for over 20 years.  That moisturizer was perfect- amazing texture, good pump packaging, and most importantly it was 100% effective at keeping my redness at bay.
This stuff (which is essentially their replacement to that one) is  garbage.  It's tinted (why?), it has a sticky texture which makes it difficult to blend in, and the packaging is cheap.   On top of all that, it actually has made my redness worse.  Oh!  And it has HALF the amount of the product as the Ultra Calming moisturizer- for a higher price.   Corporate greed trickling down to the consumer does not go unnoticed.  Johnson & Johnson majorly dropped the ball with this new ""Calm and Restore"" line. * Aveeno used to make worlds most perfect face moisturizer. When it was discontinued I was distraught. I tried so many products but my skin breaks out to everything. I figured this is the closest thing they had to the moisturizer I loved so much. It's not. IT IS SO STICKY. It feels AWFUL on my face. I always wash my hands after using it. It doesn't spread well because it's so sticky. it feels like it isn't moisturizing at all. It's also tinted?? Why?? Why is it a tan color? It would probably be awful for any dark skin girlies. I'm super pale so it's too tan for me, and when I itch my face, a ton of orange pigment comes off onto my hands. God I'm so disappointed in Aveeno for discontinuing their last calm and restore product. This one is awful…. * This is a tinted product, which I personally am not a fan of. It also doesn't say anywhere on the bottle that it's tinted? And I find that it pills a lot, But I have very sensitive skin and it hasn't irritated me or broken me out so not bad overall"

It doesn't have a nasty smell and it's not too overbearing either! I noticed my skin felt way smoother after using as well. I love it and will for sure buy again. * This is my favorite sunscreen. I buy it over and over again. I'm very pale so I can't speak about white cast, but it's not a mineral sunscreen so that shouldn't be a huge problem. It is very hydrating but not oily. It feels like I've just put on a nice moisturizer. It also reapplies very well. It never pills on top of itself. I don't wear foundation so I don't know about wearing it under anything but it does look good under a skin tint or concealer. * Tried this out for a humid, 100 degree full sun TX vacation. It never stung my eyes! It leaves a shine, but is comfortable to wear and less greasy than any others I've tried. Effective, comfortable, I'm sold! * This is great to use in the morning before my run. I have normal/combination skin and I don't even need to wear a moisturizer under this. It gives me a glow, not over the top. Doesn't sting my eyes, even when I sweat.  I also love the oil-free version for everyday use. That version is perfect over moisturizer and will work best for those with oilier skin. Shiseidos newest sunscreens are a big improvement from their previous version, which I already used. * The only sunscreen that EVER worked for me. Doesn't make my skin break out in fact this sunscreen helped my oily skin get under control. It hydrates without being oily! I don't even need moisturizer with this sunscreen. Thank you ulta for carrying this gem! * not waterproof...this product is a joke.
says "" if sweating or swimming, use a waterproof sunscreen ""

Really? what's the point of a sunscreen?
And the customer service was least helpful. * I rarely give product reviews but two thumbs up for this sunscreen!  I have used several types and brands of sunscreens and other Shiseido sunscreens as well.  This, by far, is the best for me as it applies really smooth on my skin, sits well under my make-up, and never leaves that white residue on my face.  It has enough SPF to protect my skin under the sun as I take a lot of outdoor photography plus it also leaves my face really moisturized throughout the day."

The tube is a little funky but a gentle squeeze as you pump the top and you're good to go. * I've tried pretty much every mineral sunscreen on the market, only to absolutely hate the way it feels and looks on my skin or it burns my sensitive eyes.... BUT this one checks all the boxes!  It doesn't leave a white cast, doesn't feel heavy or burn your eyes and actually feels really nice on the skin, plus leaves a smooth canvas for makeup.  Highly recommend and as long as they continue to make it, I will continue to use this sunscreen product exclusively. * I ordered two tubes (it was on sale!) and the pump on both tubes was defective. I could not get the product out of the tube to try it. I tried many different ways (short of cutting the tube open). I am so disappointed. * The product is fine. The packaging is horrible. No matter how much I pump, nothing comes out. The only way is to get any product is to squeeze the bottle and pump at the same time. * I initally bought this sunscreen because I had a few moles on my face surgically removed, my dermatologist gave me a gel to clear up the scars but it hadn't worked the way I hoped after a few months. My incision sight was still pretty deep and uneven. After only a week of applying this sunscreen both on my face and directly to my scars they faded even more than they previously had with the prescribed gel!!! It works wonders!! Both for general scars and also acne scars or pigmentation. Swear it always clears them up for me overnight. A little goes a long wayyyy. It's also the perfect size for traveling and on the go application. My skin is super soft after too, there are no cons to it. I love it! * Its okay, personally think there is a smell to it and i think its a little strong and i do not like it. It also pills and doesnt feel like my skin really absorbs it. Will finish the bottle but wont repurchase. * I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I bought this several months ago and I gave it a good shot but I can not believe so many people love this.
It's grainy, leaves a horrible white cast even on my very fair skin and just sits on the skin wrong. It doesn't sink in and dries and flakes and leaves white residue all over my clothes and eyebrows and somehow also is horribly greasy all day, and I have no idea why but no matter what I do it spreads and ends up in my eyes after about an hour after applying and it HURTS."

This is sunscreen is fine for body use, but I don't recommend it for your face. * I bought the travel size version of this  lotion two weeks ago to take with me on a trip. I've always heard really good things about this brand, and thought I'd give it a try, but unfortunately it's just not for me. I felt like the texture of this product was sticky even after drying and left my face feeling very greasy. I have rosacea and my skin tends to be very reactive to new products. I was hoping this would be different, but it did make my entire face break out pretty badly. The fragrance is much heavier than I would like from a facial sunscreen. The sun protection factor was great, and I will continue to use the rest of the product on my chest/hands/body. If you have dry skin and don't have sensitivity issues like I do, this probably is a great product. * I absolutely love this product!!! Ive been using it for years and its the only thing that doesnt make me get sun burns. I will say its a bit on the oily side but if you plan on tanning or just laying by the pool i dont see a big deal in looking a bit oily . It blends so well with my skin tone i will be buying again * As always, loveee shisiedo sunscreens. This is just like the original, but hey the more SPF, the better. No white cast, no break outs, and my makeup never pills while using this. I see sometimes people worry about wateriness, but that's only happened to me if my bottle was in my bag on a hot day or I forgot to shake it well before squeezing some out. * Great for dry skin.

Did not have any issues with pilling and wore beautifully under my matte foundations! * This is a very good sunscreen, but I think they need to take it back to the lab and tweak the formula as it flakes and pills by midday. Because of this, you cannot wear it under foundation otherwise you'll have a big mess on your face. I've been using it for about a year now but I'm currently looking for another brand. I will revisit this product in the future if they ever improve the formula.

Excellent mineral based SPF

Great price! * I purchased this item when it first came out, and I was very excited to support a black owned brand and have another option for a mineral sunscreen that wouldn't look crazy on darker skin. It does blend in very well, although it still has a slight light cast as any mineral sunscreen is going to. However, I noticed that it would pill throughout the day. I tend to unconsciously rub my face throughout the day, and I would get little bits of sunscreen on my hands. I tried using other products underneath thinking my vitamin c or my moisturizer was the issue, but no matter what combination it always pilled. * I have dry skin and really wanted to try this out but I didn't know it gave a matte finish so I follow it up with a water resistant sunscreen from black girl sunscreen. * This product leaves no white cast and has a matte finish which is a plus however it pills very easily and flakes off throughout the day. Due to this, I am unable to apply any sort of blush/ highlight/ etc. after application as it will cause the sunscreen to flake off which is clearly not ideal. For reference I have combination skin. * I've tried this several times since I purchased it and no matter what I try, it pills up and flakes all day whether alone or under makeup, with or without my skincare.  After seeing the rave reviews I had really high hopes for this.  The search continues! * I bought this sunscreen along with the Supergoop unseen sunscreen and I am returning the supergoop sunscreen and keeping this one. I have medium skin and this doesn't leave a white cast. I love that it works well with my skincare and under my makeup. I haven't had no issues with it pilling on me or it making my face look extra greasy. I wish that it had a higher spf but I  will still be repurchasing."

It's light. 
It doesn't irritate the eyes.
It doesn't have any weird smell that sometimes sunscreen has.

I love adding a super watery cream underneath it,

Be sure to wash your face and moisturize prior to applying the sun screen and makeup. It really helps to keep your skin from feeling dry. 

The consistency is very liquidy. It doesnt feel sticky. Although it does leave a white cast when worn alone so I avoid doing so. Instead, I apply the Shiseido stick sun screen when im bare faced. I havent experienced any eye irritations with this."

Overall my favorite sunscreen i have ever used. My only complaint it is does get a tad greasy- I wouldnt say it is terrible, but i dont mind greasy when im running! * This is so lush and smells heavenly. I loved using this before going outside in my walks knowing my skin smelled amazing and was protected 

*this review was collected as part of a promotion* * I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen. Its so moisturizing and it doesn't make me feel sticky after putting a lot of layers on. I also wake up and my skin is still soft from the sunscreen. Definitely going to continue to buy this sunscreen. * This is my first time trying a Hempz product and I am completely in love with it. I have tried a few sunscreens in the past, but I always get turned off by their scent. The Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon sunscreen instantly became a favorite because it smells great and doesn't leave a white cast.

Putting on this sunscreen made me want to travel. I get an instant ""St. Tropez"" feeling. I would describe the scent as walking down the beach because it made me reminisce about a time when I lived in a beach town. It made me also want to take a walk down the beach while holding hands with a lover. 

I honestly did not notice the smell of the hemp oil, which means the brand did a great job masking it with the pineapple and melon.I was not the only one who fell in love with it. My sister who is a lifeguard has been on the hunt for a high-quality sunscreen. She snatched this from me the moment she tried it.

We both agreed that it won the ""Best Smelling Sunscreen"" award. The best part about this sunscreen is that it's very moisturizing. It felt as if I was putting on lotion instead of sunscreen. 

I believe this product is great for the gourmand girlies. I would recommend keeping this in your purse and using it as hand lotion. I'm pretty sure our hands need sunscreen anyway! * This product is like if your favorite body spray, moisturizer and sunscreen had a baby. Super fresh smelling and easy application. It actually smell's so good I couldn't believe it was spf 30. Identical to the look and feel of the old favaorite hempz lotion. I've been working in the beauty industry for more than a decade and I can't remember a time that I didn't have a pump of that lotion laying around. This will be a new staple in my beach bag absolutely! * Hi!  My name is Lisa and I'm a fan of This Hempz SPF 30 sunscreen has become one of my new favorites. The Sweet Pineapple and Honey Melon scent is perfect for summer, it reminds me of a tropical beach vacation. Hempz products are super moisturizing, formulated with 100% Hemp Seed Oil, they leave my skin feeling soft and nourished. This SPF also has Vitamin C for additional skin care benefits, I've noticed it adds a nice glow and evens out my overall complexion. I like that I can use this for protection against the sun and still get some healthy color. If you are looking for a new SPF that provides rich hydration, never leaves a white cast and smells amazing try this! This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I really like the texture of this SPF it is very lightweight and it doesn't leave a white cast.  But I don't like the stickiness when it drying down. I love the smell of this it smells Delicious and sweet. It has vitamin C in it which helps brighten your skin and the hemp seed oil is moisturizing which is a plus. My skin feels and look very hydrating. I put SPF on my face faithfully every day, but I always forget to put SPF on my body and if you do the same I think this would be perfect because it just feels like lotion, not an SPF so I would grab it and throw it in my bag on the go and use it everyday due to the smell."

Just…no. * The lotion feels thin but it still does not quite rub in completely. Especially if you sweat, you will have white everywhere. I am very fair skinned and the white still shows up and doesn't go away, would not recommend. * If you have combination to oily skin and don't plan to wear makeup over your sunscreen or do something while wearing it that makes you sweat, then this might, emphasis on might, be okay for you.
The only things that this product does well is the SPF 45 rating, the percentage of vitamin C, and it does NOT burn my eyes at all.
That being said, it is not moisturizing, it is not a good primer for makeup, it does not sit on skin well because it moves around a ton (even on clean bare skin), it doesn't play well with any other products since it pills at the drop of a hat, and it does have a pretty bad white cast (but that is to be expected since it's zinc oxide).
So far, it has not made me break out and I didn't get a sunburn, but I can't use it with any of my other products, which doesn't make me want to wear it at all. Several other people complained about the smell, but the smell didn't bother me. Initially I thought it smelled like lemon or citrus, but in looking at the ingredients, I think I was smelling the Rooibos? Doesn't smell like a typical sunscreen to me. Still would not recommend this unfortunately. * Im acne prone and oily, i read it left a white cast so i tried a facial oil prior to applying it, it left thick white cast and left my skin feeling flaky and dry. Will be returning! * I have bought other products from Derma E and have loved them, so I did not expect to walk around with a ghost like face. * I was excited to try this moisturizing sunscreen.

Following the directions I apply generously to face and neck, but didn't re-apply every 2 hours--just once more in the middle of the day on no makeup days. The tube lasted less than 2 weeks using it this way. WAY too spendy * I received this product as a sample initially, and I will say that I hesitated to try it because I usually only use products labeled ""clean"" and ""cruelty-free"" and this is neither of those. Additionally, this moisturizer has a slight fragrance which would usually disqualify it from my regimen but I got hooked on the scent and the effect. I had 2 small wrinkles between my eyebrows and after using this, they're gone. I use this over my serums and facial creams and I'll buy this again and again. * I love the moisturizing, glowy feeling of the product with SPF!

It's not sticky, goes on smooth and leaves a beautiful glow and looks so natural! * This product goes on very heavy and greasy so I was already nervous.  I headed out on a hike and six miles in, it started melting and oozing into my eyes.  There was nothing I could do at that point. Worst sunscreen ever. Buy Goop Unseen Sunscreen. * Best SPF ever. I love the glowy finish and it even works under my makeup. * I tried this in store while shopping and immediately fell in love, I've been using it for 2 weeks now.

I was looking for a high SPF mineral formula without too much of a white cast. This was OK on first application - a little thick though so you need to work it in; then as you reapply, it turns into glue. Takes a lot to get it off of your body in the shower. However, no sunburns with multiple applications. No skin irritation. * It's not terrible, but I do not like it remotely, HALF as much as I like the Ulta brand one. I'm new to mineral sunscreens and I bought 2 from Sun Bum and 1 from Ulta. Both of the Sun Bum mineral sunscreens (SPF 30 and 50) are chunky and ridiculously harder to spread on the body. I felt like I was spreading toothpaste, or bondo on my legs and arms. I couldn't imagine trying to put it on my face. The Ulta brand is a sheer delight to put on in comparison. I felt like I COULDN'T rub it in and get past the white cast, and I am so pale I could blend in with a cloud. After seeing how hard it was on my legs (30SPF) and arms (50SPF), I didn't DARE use it on my face and I used the Ulta instead. 50SPF was the intended sunscreen for the face, but that wasn't happening with how delicate my face is from acne right now. Yeesh. I'll use the Sun Bums, and my husband will, but I definitely wouldn't repurchase it. Makes me reconsider the entire line from this brand after both tubes were so much chunkier in consistency and THICCER than your girls thighs versus Ulta's. * This is thick upon applying it, but after about 10 minutes it settles. I love this for my sensitive, allergy-prone skin. It is also chemical free which is great for sensitive skin! My favorite part is the no white cast. I don't know how they managed to do it without tinting it, but this is POC friendly. Also doesn't pill like most physical sunscreens do. * I purchased to use as a moisturizer sunscreen per recommendation of store associate to protect hyperpigmentation. This product is very thick and sticky. It burns my skin also. Not a good purchase. * I used the spf 50 version of this formula, but sadly it was too heavy for me and caused breakouts. This formula seems much lighter, the white cast is not bad, and the feel is good! Still a bit on the heavier side of sunscreens for me, which is why this is going to be my go-to winter sunscreen. I won't bother to look for another, this one does it the best! * A little background on my skin: I'm a redhead and have very fair/ pale skin (alabaster foundation) which is moderately sensitive and burns easily (and won't ever tan, it just peels and burns again). This sunscreen uses fragrance, but doesn't irritate my skin. It feels lightweight and not greasy. The formula is thin enough to easily apply and rub in quickly (much better than the Cotz mineral sunscreen for face and body, non tinted). It smells like coconut, which I love, and doesn't leave a cast or sticky grease layer on my skin.
If you have a deeper complexion than me and are concerned about a cast, I couldn't say for sure but I think this stuff is worth a try since it's so thin and rubs in so well. If you have very sensitive skin, just tread carefully as the scent is very strong. Definitely worth a try, but keep the receipt just in case it doesn't work for you. Hope this helps! * The only downside is that this uses fragrance. Thankfully, my skin isn't extremely sensitive so this is okay for me, but if you have very sensitive skin or are allergic to coconut I would tread carefully if you try this. If you don't have sensitive skin, it smells so nice and absorbs quickly without leaving a cast. However, I have very pale skin (I usually use Alabaster foundation with cool undertone) and don't know if this will leave a cast if you have a deeper complexion. It's thin enough that it's probably worth a try though, since you can rub it in so well. Hope this is helpful!"

This Product received a poor raring on Yuka App. Product contains many harmful ingredients including dimethicone  which harms the environment and ends up in the blood of fish, birds and mammals building up in the environment without ever breaking down. Cotz advertising is an example of brand green washing at its finest. * This is good for touch ups when you're on the go. Despite being a stick format, it has a mousse like texture. I like that it can fit in a pocketbook (the cylinder shape makes it awkward for a pants pocket). This does feel heavy on my skin (normal/balanced type) and has a sticky/tacky feel after application. This also left a whitecast on my skin (Fitzpatrick type 2, fair Asian Skin, wear clinque foundation in shade bone; I swiped at least 4x per section of my face to have adequatecl coverage). The finish is definitely on the shiny side, especially for me. My preference is for matte or skinlike finish, so this was too shiny for me, but someone who likes a glowy finish may like this. I would recommend this for someone with fair skin on the dry side (or balanced/normal in a dry climate) and doesn't mind a shinier/""glowy"" finish."

Matte products work best for me here. * This sunscreen is oily and made mg face look like a greased skillet. I waited ten minutes and then put on liquid foundation, and it was a slippery mess. Brush strokes all over my face. 
I cant say one nice thing about this product."

However, it doesnt sink into the skin and I ended up with little white pilling all over my face. I tried using after thoroughly hydrsting my skin and still the same issue. Would not recommend * Oil-free but feels slimy and has a weird smell.  I have combo skin so it feels really greasy.  Glad I got it on sale and won't repurchase. * Might work on super dry skin, but not for my normal (sometimes normal/oily combo) skin.   Makeup is sliding off after 30 minutes.  Glad I purchased while on sale because not worth the full price.  Will keep to use on hands and neck since it does not smell and still need sunscreen protection. * I live by Avene products and wanted to love this so badly. Maybe I got a bad batch, but there is a lingering smell to this that I just cant get past. * As someone who has tried dozens of sunscreens, this one is elite in my opinion. The skincare in it makes my skin so glowy and hydrating and I love how dewy my skin looks when wearing. It wears well under make up, but you do have to rub it in well to prevent the white cast and so that the product absorbs in fully. It does feel a little bit sticky and a little heavy, but I don't necessarily mind that. Overall it feels more like skincare than sunscreen in my opinion and I will definitely repurchase."

It's lightweight, non-greasy, and gives my skin a nice glow. However, every time I use it, by the next day, there's zits that pop up. This is the only new product I've introduced. I believe it's the tocopheryl. :( * Very irritating * I need to wear sunscreen daily because of my acne products, but I've yet to find one that doesn't clog my pores even further. Seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I bought this when it was on sale. Sadly, it doesn't live up to the hype. It was lightweight on my skin, but it smells like cheap body sunblock. And every time I used it I had a new zit forming by the end of the day, without changing anything else in my skin routine. I wanted this to work so badly, but it does the opposite of being good for acne prone skin. * I was going to give 4 stars because it has a Proactiv scent I'm not in love with, However 5 stars because it does a great job as an spf as well as clearing up your face at the same time. * Since I am using retinol, my dermatologist insists that I wear sunscreen.  I have struggled to find any spf sunscreen that my reactive sensitive oily acne-prone mature skin doesn't breakout to and react to.

This is my first facial sunscreen success.  This one is great!  Doesn't leave me greasy or overly shiny.  Doesn't irritate or break out my skin.  I only wish it was higher spf, but better spf 30 than nothing. * I have very oily skin and hate wearing SPF. I have trial and errored so many mositurizers and this is the best one. Doesn't feel greasy or heavy on my skin. Actually has cut down on me looking greasy throughout the day. Highly recommend! * I have purchased this sunscreen many times. It is the best sunscreen to use under makeup. It isn't greasy, doesn't pill and it doesn't break me out."

This one feels very gritty going on takes a good while to absorb and dry down and it pilled as well. Does feel better after applying the moisturizer as recommended. Face now feels soft and not oily or greasy. Not sure if I will continue to use as my spf after this is finished, also small amount and expensive to use every day. * It is a more than wonderful serum for oily skin. It makes the skin clear, fresh, hydrated and free of blemishes. Youthful, attractive and vibrant. It makes the skin like the skin of children. It is like magic for the skin. * I lobe beautystat all products. vitamin C serum looks amazing would love to try. * I love the texture of this product so much & what it does for my skin. * This is one of my faves from beautystat! This has vitamin c in it as well as sunscreen! I love this two in one daily serum, not only does it protect me from the daily harmful rays but it also helps brighten my skin as it's preventing & eliminating my dark spots, wrinkles, and fine lines! I've only tried this for a few weeks and I can already see the difference and smoothness in my face and my neck! You should give it a try, followed by their amazing moisturizer! * Very good serum and it's a good price. I highly recommend it. I will continue to buy it. It brightens up my skin. * This has a gritty texture and leaves a little bit of a white cast. But thats expected from a mineral SPF and a small price to pay for a good formula. I feel good about using this as my daily protection because it gives my skin the brightening benefits of vitamin c.  Ill repurchase this. Its worth the money."

(: literally love it and recommend if you want sunscreen thats light and watery and makes your skin glow < 3 * Skin is glowing and protected * I recently switched from Cerave am spf30 which left my skin feeling dry and would have to combine with cocoa butter. I've been using this product for about 2 weeks. I have eczema and this leaves my face feeling moisturized for the entire day. No white cast, lightweight but offered full coverage. A little goes a long way. It's good but expensive which is my reason for the 4 stars. My face feels more hydrated and softer. * I've been trying this sunscreen for almost a week now. It applies nicely on the skin at first but my face looks greasy. Do not put this sunscreen near your eyes it made mine irritated and gave a stinging feeling throughout the day. It has the typical sunscreen smell but it is not too heavy. Small breakouts. Save your money from this product it is not all that."

Its perfect for my very oily skin and actually keeps me matte most of the day! I'm not in a very humid climate though. It works very well as a primer underneath a tinted moisturizer I use as well. * Sits on skin. Doesn't sink in. Stays white and wipes right off. * Nice sunscreen! Dries matte. Don't rub it in too much, it will roll off on your skin. * I love the way it absorbs into my oily skin and gives me a matt finish. It's not greasy and it's not fragrant. It is wonderful for in the hot Alabama sun and damp winter. * I have combo skin that in summer humidity is extremely oily and acne prone. This product is the absolute best product I have ever used to control shine, including regular non SPF moisturizers. Normally, I have to blot my face a dozen times a day, no exaggeration, and with this I don't have to blot at all! Life changing! It works amazing under makeup and the sun protection lasts all day. This does not dry the skin and I used it alone without another moisturizer. I use this even when not going outside just for the matte finish. It does not cause acne either. LOVE it. I read another review that mentioned pilling, I did not experience this."

The hotel was selling this sunscreen. I was a bit hesitant because I break out easily, but had to purchase since we were staying on a beach with intense sun. I wore this for 3 days, reapplied every few hours, and I did not get a single sunburn. Surprisingly, I also did not break out. There is a slight white cast, which I don't mind as it makes my skin look a bit glowy. I definitely would repurchase this sunscreen. * So, i guess mineral sunscreens just arent meant for me. I tried a bit on my hand in the store and was hopeful because it didnt leave a shiny grease spot on me, and i didnt notice the white pallor it left (dang tricky store lighting) but with the first face application, i could see i made a mistake. I am VERY fair to begin with and now i look like Casper with this lotion! Add to it the slight sting it causes and dry flaky skin the next day and this is just ALL bad. Only reason i gave 2 stars is because of the non-greasyness * I wanted to try something new for once. I put it on, it felt fine and looked fine. the next day I woke up and my face was flaky, red, and burning. I couldn't go anywhere for a few days not even to work! * I bought this sunscreen becuase i have heard good things about Supergoop! and becuase this is a mineral based sunscreen. I already knew that the zinc oxide in this gives a white cast, but I was not prepared how hard I had to rub my skin to get this slighlty blended into my skin. Would not purchase again * When I first tried it on my hand, I felt it rubbed in we'll so I was hopeful because it's so hard to find sunscreen for brown skin tones. But after using it fully on my face and arms, it started to pill when I had moisturizer, cream, or eczema ointment underneath. It was kind of like it turned to hard paste when trying to rub into skin because the consistency changed. It was pilling on my arms more because I put moisturizer beforehand. I put it on my face without moisturizer underneath and had a white cast for at least 4 hours until the natural oils on my face came in and flushed it out a bit. It's not for darker complexions. It has a chalky sunscreen smell. It's very pricey for sunscreen and I expected better. * I read a review on here that said this sunscreen leaves a white cast and I 100% attest to that. It's a pretty strong white cast that might work for a day at the beach but not for regular use. Hopefully Supergoop! can make a mineral sunscreen for darker complexions but for now I'll continue using their Play: Everyday Lotion SPF 30. * Wanted to like this because its 100% mineral but the white overcast on my complexion is too much for me to use. The regular Play lotion works better for me."

And it expensive considering the content. * this sunscreen is great. at first i was not a fan but as continued to use it i found that the pros outweighed the cons. what i love about it is that one pump goes a long way and it spreads nicely. i also love that it doesnt leave a white cast. i apply this on my facial hair and it dries clear. its pretty insane. i was gagged when it dried clear on my BEARED! i was sold after that. it also leaves the skin tacky and glowy, which i love. the only con is that its watery but i noticed that it allows the sunscreen to spread and glide across the skin nicley. like i said, a little goes a long way. i think for people with facial hair, its hard to reach the skin underneath, so i do use more than the avergave person. its a decent amount of product for the price but for people who need to use more, it can be just enough for like a month. nonethless, she did what needed to be done. * I usually don't write reviews but I had such a terrible experience with this product that I felt it was only fair to share my results because my skin looked the worst that it has ever looked in my life!!

I had been using Mario Badescu's Hydro Moisturizer w/ Vit C and my skin was looking great with no breakouts.  Unfortunately, that moisturizer doesn't have SPF in it so I decided to try this sunscreen.  My skin isn't sensitive, but it could not handle this sunscreen. I experienced terrible breakouts around my jawline (which has never happened before) and it took a long time for my skin to clear.

I am a fan of Mario B's products, just not this one… * This is the most misunderstood sunscreen. It is so beautiful and lightweight. The glow is so  amazing! It wears beautifully under makeup too! * has a white cast… * I am always looking for a good mineral sunscreen. The ladies at Ulta recommended this one -and they were right! 
Lightweight, blends easily, slight white cast when first applied (I expect that with a mineral formula) but after waiting the requisite 15 minutes-it has disappeared into my skin. 
Good price point too * I've finally found a sunscreen that works for me. Mineral sunscreen tends to leave a white cast, but I did not have that with this one. I can layer it on top of my serums and moisturizer with no pilling, and it extremely lightweight compared to what I've used in the past. I generally hate using sunscreen, too, but this one is so easy to use that I can see myself using it all year long (as we should be protecting our skin, even in the winter months). I'm also prone to acne and cysts, and I have yet to have a problem and I've been using this stuff since May."

I use about 5 drops and my skin feels very moisturized afterwards. Will definitely buy again. * This is lightweight, nourishes the skin, leaves 0 white cast and is non greasy. I even use it on my scalp when my locs have been freshly retied to protect it from the sun as well. It also works well under makeup and is easy to reapply if needed. I definitely recommend * I live in Florida and have combination skin, so this only really works well for me in the winter or when I'm traveling somewhere drier. With my oily t-zone and the Florida humidity, I found myself mostly using this on my body throughout the spring rather than on my face as much. As the name says, it's an oil, but it's not heavy or too greasy if you don't overapply. It has a nice slip to it and smells AMAZING. When I use just enough to cover my skin, it seems to dry down a little while still leaving a bit of glow. If I use too much (as I have done trying to make sure I cover all my shoulders/chest/arms), I can definitely feel it sitting on the skin. Overall, I'd say if your skin tends to be more dry, or you live somewhere dry, you will like this facial oil SPF. I prefer something less oily because of my combination skin and that's a mineral SPF so my go-to is actually the Undefined Sun Serum. * Im madly inlove. I use a toner and then put this on and then a moisturizer after and my skin looks, feels, and smells incredible. Id buy it over and over. If youre a matte girly this isnt for you, but if you love natural looking dewy skin..this is PERFECTION. * The way my skin feels and looks after using this is unmatched. I am a huge fan of Undefined Beauty in general and sun elixir is just another piece of proof that it's a brand worth sticking with. No stickiness and no greasy look! 10/10 ."

It definitely a must try with its fabulous skincare ingredient list! I love that it gave such beauty dewy glow to my skin. * I've been using this for a few weeks now and I definitely enjoy it. It works in easy and leaves no cast. The smell is a light 'pleasant summer pool day' type of scent that dissipates quickly. I'm not sure what ""skin type"" I have but it tends be be on the oily side. If you have a similar type, I'd advise less is more for this product. There is a very fine line between greasy and glow. * I love this sun crème! It goes on smooth and feels very nourishing unlike other sun creams that feel like they're sitting on your face. I also love how dewy it made my face look without any weird white, chalky, residue! Must buy :) * This sunscreen glides on smoothly and no chalky film. It's super lightweight. Thanks for the protection!!! * I'm really satisfied with this sunscreen. It works well and gives my face a nice little glow. The only small problem that I found with it is that it gives off a bit of a vodka-like scent. The bottle is just adorable!

I don't notice any color tho. So nice for a sunscreen that sinks into your skin but my skin looks no different in tone after putting it on. * This is super lightweight, moisturizing, and easy to blend. It doesn't have a noticeable tint once its applied, and the spf level is great for everyday use but not prolonged sun exposure. A lot of reviews mention whitecast or pilling- I haven't had issues with either. I am very pale though. I only use it with other pacifica products, which might help prevent pilling. It's nice but I'll probably opt for the spf30 lotion once I run out. * apples like chalk * Actyally the worst sunscreen ever :( HORRIBLE white cast and pilled an insane amount. I waited for all of my products to absorb before putting this on and it still pilled like crazy and left an AWFUL white cast * I love Pacifica's Vitamin Sea SPF and was looking for a less oily version, but unfortunately this SPF leaves an awful white cast despite it being tinted * Really great spf for sensitive and acne prone skin but it leaves an insane white cast on my face that's really difficult to blend.
