1,tula,protect + glow daily sunscreen gel broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2016249,2562776," * This was always my go to. I loved it until recently. Half way through my 3rd bottle and the sunscreen now has a different consistently and is pilling everytime. It's not expired and was not expecting this especially for the price. Won't be repurchasing and would not recommend. * Tula made a sunscreen serum that was fantastic! Best i ever used. They stopped making it this year so i switched over to this one. Its nothing like the serum! This is heavy, greasy and causes breakouts. It also has a strong smell. Please Bring the serum back! * Got this from FabFitFun! I love this sunscreen - for the brown girlies! This leaves no white cast, smells like bananas, very tropical and leaves your skin with a beautiful glow. * This is my favorite daily spf. I've received a lot of compliments about my skin when I use this product. My only wish for this item is that it would come in a stronger spf. An spf 50 would be ideal! * This is not gel!  This is oily and chunky and awful.  Do NOT buy and waste your money.  First time I've been disappointed by Tula. * This is a good lotion but it's very shiney! * This is such an amazing product! Its so glowy, moisyering amd it has SPF (which is your BFF) i hibetsly think it coulc work fir every skin type. It is worth EVERY CENT."
2,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen spf 40,pimprod2029930,2589386," * I like this product didnt really have a problem with it, its just that i dont like how it feels on my skin. As someone with combination skin it would leave a matteish finish but after a few minutes i wouldn't see that matteiah finish and my glow would comeback. Some people like that glowy look but its just not for me because of my skin type and my preference. Good product just not for me. * I like this product didnt really have a problem with it, its just that i dont like how it feels on my skin.

Some people like that glowy look but its just not for me because of my skin type and my preference. Good product just not for me. * The Ulta Unseen Sunscreen SPF 50 which I received complimentary from Supergoop feels like a primer yet has the protection of a sunscreen.  I love it because it is beneficial for my skin as it diminishes pores and allows for smoother makeup application.   The formula is unique and stands out because of its performance.   I highly recommend especially for traveling and busy days. * This is my all time favorite sunscreen. It is so great for everyday and using underneath makeup. It doesnt pill or change the texture of my makeup. Its weightless and it doesnt leave a white cast. Obsessed! Gifted by supergoop * It's good, just not worth money or intrigues me anymore. Burns eyes, makes skin slightly irritated. Wouldn't buy because there's better for sale out there. * I really like this sunscreen. I buy this size, because I think it is too expensive. * i've struggled with finding a face sunscreen for decades. i'll never look elsewhere. feels so good when it goes on (smooth!) and disappears instantly. isn't shiny, isn't matte, doesn't have any sort of cast. no weird smell. makes a great base for makeup and washes off easily."
3,la roche-posay,anthelios uv correct spf 70 daily face sunscreen with niacinamide,pimprod2030180,2591831," * I like it for most part... but if you sweat, or rub your eyes, it burns for a really long time. * I purchased this product three times. The first time was great i fell in love instantly, it was greasy, it dried down beautifully and it was great under makeup. Not to mention 70SPF?? Heck ye! So i bought it a second time and i used it for the first few months no problem, and then my eyes started to water..not sting, just water. And i thought hm well thats weird cant be my sunscreen cause ive been using it with no issues, and i was running out so i think purchased my third and final bottle and oh my gods when i tell yall my eyes BURNED. Within the first month of purchasing my third bottle i had to constantly wash my face because i couldnt keep my eyes open. But again, it couldnt have been the sunscreen right?? So for the next weeks i isolated my skincare products and all were perfectly fine…except for this sunscreen. By this time it was too late to return it so in the trash it sadly went. Ive never been so heartbroken, if they changed their formula or if my skin just got allergic to it over time i dont know. Im on the search for a new perfect sunscreen, wish me luck. * I have oily to combination skin and this product is not sweat proof or water proof as stated in the description. I will say this product did correct my darkspots and protected my skin. The lotion does need to be rubbed in and does peel after the second hour but the protection is present. I can only wear inside my house due to it being hot and me being sweaty. * It burned my eyes. I didn't put around eye area. I really wanted to love this spf 70, but it was too hard to work with. left face drier than before I put it on. I had to return it. * I wish I could love this product more; unfortunately, every time I apply this product it would irritate my eyes. Of course, I tried to avoid eye area, but still a few minutes after the application, my eyes would be irritated. If you have sensitive eyes, I would not recommend it. * This sunscreen is sheer and I like it very much. Sadly, it's one that creeps up into my eyes and burns. * This is a hard review to write because in a lot of ways its exactly what I'm looking for: moisturizing, has spf, gentle. The big reason I wouldn't buy it again is it melts into my eyes and stings terribly. Ive actually had to pull off the road barely able to keep my eyes open another second with a waterful of tears (product induced— not weeping) making the whole situation worse. It must not happened to everyone, which is why I gave it for stars. It just doesn't work for me."

5,vacation,classic whip spf 30 sunscreen mousse,pimprod2033019,2596247," * I'll admit, I purchased this sunscreen solely because of the packaging—and it turned out to be incredible. The texture is unique and easy to apply. I also love the smell. 

To everyone saying it made their eyes water or irritated the skin on their face, please know that it is intended for the BODY. The company advises against using it on the face—neck down only and you'll be just fine. xo * Yeah…. I definitely ""applied"" common sense and used only on my body, but unless you wanna risk your face to a breakout or some other sensitive reaction go for it! * Bought this for my 11y/o granddaughter and she loves. It's a sunscreen that she can and does apply to her arms and legs easily and independently. It's not a mess to apply and doesnt drip. Even her dad wanted to try it! * i was lit so excited to try this bc ive seen it on tiktok and it look rlly cool but its not that good. my skin complexion is medium / darkish tan and it leaves a slight white cast on me unless i rub it for a long time so it definitely will leave on a white cast on darker skin. also the smell is absolutely horrible it smells like old sunscreen left to rot in the sun

i noticed this is horrible under makeup. i use the elf power grip primer and it seperated the green color on my skin and just made it look really weird and made me concealer this weird texture.

i would deff recommend this if your going out and not wearing makeup but beside that not really. * Such fun and cute sunscreen to put on, makes me want to put it on all the time! Mainly use it only for body. * It smells pretty good, and feels nice on my face but CONSTANTLY gets in my eyes. Causing them to water painfully and profusely. * I used this and it goes on super well. It works great for my face even though my skin is quite sensitive. I did end up having a slight sunburn on my face but it went away relatively quickly. Overall it a pretty good product."
6,kopari beauty,sunglaze sheer body mist sunscreen spf 42,pimprod2043793,2618935," * Totally disappointed with this product. Sprayer broken and leaked inside the shipping box. small amount of product for the price. I gave it a ""2"" because it smells good. I will not purchase again. * This has got to be one of the most god-awful things I've ever smelled. Keep in mind, I'm pregnant, but DEAR LORD, the smell is horrendous. * I am extremely fair skinned and was super excited to see a product like this with a 50spf. The first time I used it, I went to an all day music festival in the blazing sun and did not get sunburnt! Love it! 10/10 * I Purchased the sunglaze sheer Body Mist Sunscreen SPF 42 as well as the sheer setting mist sunscreen SPF 50 for a vacation and cannot say enough about these products. It worked so well, was fun, beautiful, smells amazing and nobody got burnt. * The product is nice. I like that its lightweight but it does not leave a noticable glow unless you apply a heavy amount. My main issue and reason i will not buy again is the spray mister stops working. The 1st one i purchased stopped working in it's 1st use. I tried everything to get product out and ended up having to return it for a new one at Ulta. 2nd bottle worked good a few times then it happened again. Same issue. Complete block and the sprayer stopped working. It's a cute sunscreen but at the price point of this sunscreen they really need to work out its kinks and update the mister before I consider buying again. * Bought this super excited to try it.  I tried it at the store and it smells wonderful.  Went home sprayed it twice and the spray part is broken.  I don't think they thought of the spray design too well.  It clogged or something.  I went and bought a different bottle top sprayer and only got two sprays out of it and same result doesn't work anymore lol. * while I love this sunscreen it doesn't travel well at all. I was lucky that I thought to put it in a zip lock bag because I lost a good 1/10 of the product just from seepage in my suitcase"
7,supergoop!,on-the-go spf duo,pimprod2044871,2623031, * buy this now and throw it in your purse for the summer! this is the best sunscreen. a little bit goes a long way and it's so light weight! * Loved this sunscreen
8,supergoop!,play everyday lotion spf 50 with sunflower extract pa++++,pimprod2030629,2589403," * So far I have enjoyed using this product and have no complaints......my beauty consultant, Matthew,  introduced me to this product and I'm delighted that he did......whenever I go into the store looking for assistance with a product and make a purchase, 
Matthew is very knowledgeable and helps me with products suitable for my skin tone. * Overall, I'm pleased with this sunscreen. I use it for my body when out running errands. 

There is no white cast - it blends very well. However, it does smell/feel like sunscreen. After a while, the scent fades. 

I tried applying to my face, but it was too thick, and it caused my skin to break out. I recommend using something else for your face. * It's a struggle to get everybody to wear sunscreen sometimes. This one is great because it has a light, fresh scent that isn't cloying or ""tropical"". It's not sticky or heavy feeling. The large pump bottle is a great size and shape  to tote along. Love that refill packs are available too. * I love this sunscreen a lot. It works very well, its not overly sticky or oily, it smells like rosemary and lemon which is very pleasant. Its reef friendly and vegan which I would say are my two most important things to look for in a sunscreen. I do have one problem with this one and that one of the main reasons I picked this one over another brand was the refill. So it took me a few months to get through the first one and I bought my refill and its a plastic pouch with a plastic cap, which I find extremely disappointing. If this brand was actually concerned about enviromental friendliness, they would either have refill stations inside of a store like Ulta or sell a compostable refill pouch. * I bought this looking for a glowy sunscreen that didn't make my skin oily but still hydrated my skin (I have dry skin) and this did the opposite. Whenever i wear it it makes my skin drier than it was before in a few hours and makes my skin really greasy and oily. Plus the price is really high for the mini tbat I bought. I don't recomend this and i will not be repurchasing. The only pro is that there is no whitecast. * Finally a 50 spf sunscreen that doesn't leave a white residue. * Easy to use, you don't need much, not greasy, smooth and no sun gets through!!  Love it!"
9,la roche-posay,anthelios melt-in milk body & face sunscreen lotion spf 100,pimprod2013150,2559778," * Bought before going to FL for a few weeks. My porcelain skin did not burn at all! It absorbed quickly, did not cause me to breakout, did not leave my skin greasy and worked well under makeup. I used it on my face, ears, neck and arms and it worked great for me. Just be careful putting it near your eyes, it burned like crazy later in the day. Highly recommend this product! * I tried this sunblock once on my face and my skin was burning and left red marks on my face. Apparrently it's phototoxic and can cause chemical burns. Def don't recommend for sensitive skin. * It feels ""runny"" in the sense that it is so lightweight and blendable, But is not too liquidity. So far, I have been able to comfortably, use it as moisturizer, or with moisturizer, perfectly without Make-Up, and it also wears well under a full face. * I expected this to be heavy and chalky but it is clear, goes on easily, does not have a heavy scent and works really well! I would definitely recommend it. It also does not cause the skin on my face to react, even though I use trentinoin. * I have combination + sensitive skin & my forehead clogs easily, this sunscreen blends into the skin so well, leaves the skin nice & glowy & doesn't irritate or clog my pores. as a esthi I APPROVE * I love this sunscreen! I have used the SPF 60 version for a couple of years and then a year ago I decided to give this SPF 100 a shot to see if I liked it (and benefit from higher SPF!) or whether I should stick to the SPF 60. I have combo, acne-prone skin with an oily T-zone, an oil slick of a nose, and my under eyes have started to get drier. I'd describe the texture as a thick lotion so it works amazing during the  winter months as a moisturizer too, but it's not too thick for the summer months and I don't find it to be too shiny! I find this version to be a little tackier and oddly a little less shiny (by like, a hair) than the SPF 60 so I loooovvee using this under makeup on a day when I'm spending time outside but need makeup on my face! The tackiness makes it so the sunscreen dries down faster than the 60 SPF had and I can place makeup in the areas I wanted. I really liked that because I felt like when I used eyeshadow there was no danger of it sliding where I hadn't placed it -- it just stuck to the right spot. I've never used this under foundation, however, because when I'm using this I'm gonna be outside and not really wanting foundation to potentially mess up my sun protection. My 62 yr old dad also loves this, although he loves Bondi Sands SPF more probably because that one feels even more moisturizing than this. My only con is that when I reapply this, I personally have to wash off the first layer and then reapply -- sometimes it feels like the reapplication layer gets so thick that it starts irritating my eyes. But other than that, I really love this and definitely rely on it for sunny days. * I have been using LRP's Anthelios Tinted SPF and really love it but wanted something that didnt have pigment in it. I absolutely love this SPF! Last year I used one by Cerave but have struggled to find it again. I prefer this one anyways because its a little thicker, which has made it easier to keep it out of my eyes. Ive only had an issue once because I had too much product. Will definitely continue to use this! It also sits great under makeup, not greasy at all!"
10,vacation,orange gelÃ©e spf 30 sunscreen gel,pimprod2044868,2623026," * I don't know how this is so popular. The jelly is granular, it does not smell good and the container leaked everywhere after it was opened. Terrible product! * I love the thickness of this and how it resisted me sweating in the Florida sun. It gave a nice sheen and has a pleasant scent. It also stayed in place when I would briefly dip in the ocean. * Not a clone of the old school Bain de Soleil. But a close replica. It's more waxy and I guess that means it stays on better. The old gelee used to slide off with the touch of anything- clothes, towel, beach chair! The scent is adjacent, but not exact. Strong on the clove and cinnamon notes, with the jasmine coming up a little dirty. The longer you have it on, the better it smells, so give it a little time.  I am sure the perfumers were hog tied by the EU's aroma chemical restrictions. Shame. I love that it is in a metal tube, has a good SPF and seems to stay on the skin. * Just received the Vacation Orange Gelee & I am in love. Takes me back to the 70s & 80s when I was a lifeguard & using Bain de Soleil. The smell is the same as I remembered. SPF is 30 instead of an SPF of 4, which is better. This is sure to sell out. * this sunscreen glides onto skin and melts in with a light scent; so pleasant you'll forget it's sunscreen and not a luxury moisturizer * So disappointed ! I will return this. * Run, do not walk…to buy the OH-SO-Heavenly scent of the Vacation Orange Gelee SPF 30 Sunscreen Gel!  The packaging, scent and texture are almost identical to the OG Bain de Soleil!  Definitely a luxe treat, but worth it.  So glad Vacation came up with this product line."

14,vacation,super spritz spf50 face mist,pimprod2038618,2606383," * buy this if you love to torture your eyeballs!!!! * This sunscreen burns my eyes. I like the smell and it feels fine on my skin, BUT my eyes can't handle it. * I guess I'm extremely spoiled by KBeauty SPF products that you can safely use all around the eye area. I was cautious with this and shielded my eyes but it's extremely greasy and migrated into my eyes within minutes. I tried it without makeup and I don't think it would play well over makeup, especially if you're combo/oily. * I love this sunscreen. I live in Texas so sweatproof, makeup friendly, easy to reapply spf is very important and this one ticks all the boxes. Doesn't sting my eyes so I can use it hands free!  *chefs kiss* * Ok so I am not a sensitive skin girly at all - I barely break out with most products. This spray burned and I got a million pimples all over my face and cheese. Not good. * This sunscreen smells lovely and has adorable packaging. What I did not realize is that the first ingredient is alcohol so it stings if applied over acne or any kind of injured skin. I wish the spray was more of a fine mist. You definitely have to rub it in manually to get it to provide even coverage. Not the worst but I'm not planning on repurchasing. * Clearly I must be allergic to something in this stuff because my face blew up like a balloon! It was red, hot and itchy! Took DAYS for it to subside.   No thanks."
15,la roche-posay,anthelios uv hydra sunscreen spf 50 with hyaluronic acid,pimprod2043464,2620128," * I love this brand but this produnt make my face look so oily and greasy. * I have sensitive skin and one of the main reasons I purchased this sunscreen was because it was suitable for sensitive skin. Its not. Although I do love rhe texture and it does leave no white cast and is hydrating, it emphasized redness on my cheeks and thats where im more sensitive. I did see notice little breakouts since I started using this sunscreen.  Will be returning. * I wanted to like this due the price and reviews were good. For me, it just sits on top of my skin. All day. Long. Very greasy and gives my face an unwelcomed sheen. * I loved Ulta and have been a huge fan. Unfortunately with this order I've taken a step back. I paid over double the price I should have paid. I didn't get the discount bc they were out of stock and never said anything except it was canceled. * I did order 2 and one the caps were missing but idk💀 * this is the best dailu moisturizer OR just a regular SPF, its lightweight & all! * this is the best dailu moisturizer OR just a regular SPF, its lightweight & all!"

So affordable and gives the perfect amount of light coverage. It really just evens out your complexion. My skin is not sensative and leans toward dry, it has never broken me out and it gives my skin a hydrated glow. * Ive tried a ton of tinted SPFs and this is by far my favorite! So affordable and gives the perfect amount of light coverage. It really just evens out your complexion. My skin is not sensative and leans toward dry, it has never broken me out and it gives my skin a hydrated glow. * It is very smooth when applying.    Like that bit of tint it has. The only thing that I did not care for too much is the sticky feeling it leaves. I will still use it tjough * I will probably go with a darker color for the summer next time. * Returned this product, it made my skin itchy and didn't set * Compared to similar products, I would say this is a cheaper alternative for a sheer tinted sunscreen. I have combination skin and this product DOES seem to leave my skin a bit oily to the touch, like most sunscreens. However, you CAN wear makeup over this product, which helps cut down shine/oily feeling. * I really love this sunscreen. I have light/medium skin tone, so I use the medium shade of thid spf. 

I really don't understand some of the negative reviews on this spf. For me, this was amazing, not greasy, but it is moisturizing, leaves no white cast, is sheer enough I can use foundation over it, and it looks beautiful. 

I usually buy Asian sunscreens. This is the only Western sunscreen I will wear. I have repurchased this three tjmes. The packaging does suck though. The lid gets all goopy, and crusty. If they fixed this issue, it would be perfect. This spf is NOT strong enough to wear on high UV beach days. It's only spf 30. So im not surprised some people got fried at the beach using this 🙄. Its meant to wear for daily, low UV days. Wear higher spf at the beach"
19,sun bum,travel size sunscreen lotion spf 30,pimprod2014602,2564527," * Definitely the best drugstore sunscreen I reach for! Been using this since 2022 and I reach for it when I'm going on long hikes and reapply again. 

I love the smell of coconut and tropical vanilla. It's not too overbearing. 

But the best part of the sunscreen is that it doesn't leave a white cast. Don't apply too much at a time and give it time to blend in and settle before applying a little more. * The product is so wonderful. I love it so much. * It gets watery and no matter how much i shake it, it wont fix * This is good but it will make your face fill extremely oily. * it was very lightweight and had a very good tropical smell, but it is a bit small for the price * smells great, peels really bad even with nothing under or on top of it. * it pills wouldnt buy agajn"
20,supergoop!,mineral mattescreen spf 40,pimprod2029941,2589388," * I really like this stuff. It goes on smooth and blurs your skin, stays matte all day, and is great on my ultra sensitive skin. Idk how it is under makeup because I dont wear anything for complexion other than this. It is VERY matte tho. I have combo skin and by the end of the day, my oily places are still locked in place, while my dryer spots are flaking and super tight. Just keep that in mind - the regular mineral sunscreen may be better for combo skin. * Bought this when it was half off to try it out. I'm a sunscreen nut, since I'm white as sin and skin cancer runs in the family, and it's a new favorite for all of us (especially since our all time top fave, the La Roche Posay unscented sunscreen with ecamsule, isn't really sold in the US). I love that it's so smooth and doesn't leave a cast for a completely mineral sunscreen.

There's a slight tint to it that does show when it goes on - I'm pretty pale (I'm usually a ""porcelain"" or ""fair neutral"" in CC creams) and it blends in seamlessly into my skin, as well as my spouse, who is a marginal couple of shades darker and pinker than me. This probably isn't a good sunscreen for anyone darker than a medium beige or lighter end of tan. It isn't really truly color-correcting on its own, but the tint does serve some color-balancing properties that I like.

I have combination skin - oily in some parts, dry in others, and the mousse-like texture is the perfect medium to be able to apply all over my face and neck. I have had absolutely no drip into my eyes like I have had when I get sweaty with other sunscreens, even from this brand. It also works as a great makeup base, as someone who usually veers towards silicone-based or pore appearance-reducing mattifying primers.

My skin is also extraordinarily sensitive (chronic eczema, lots of allergies, even ""hypoallergenic"" things sometimes make me break out in acne or rashes) and my skin loves this stuff. No breakouts, no acne, no red patches.

I will say that the tint does have the ability to transfer - I still mask on public transportation and I sometimes see the color rub off in high-friction contact places on the inside of my mask when it's a sunscreen-only day, but I never apply a setting spray over just sunscreen. * Great for humid hot summer days. The tint is perfect. Use alone or under foundation. * I love this mineral sunscreen. I can easily wear it under my makeup or on its own for makeup free days. * I was AMAZED at how well this works for my oily skin. Im usually oily by mid day but this keeps me matte ALL day even in Texas heat. I use this under my makeup and it works better than any primer ive ever bought. 10/10 * I'm in my early 50's with fair, combination, sensitive skin.  In the winter I use a liquid foundation with SPF built in (for the extra moisture) but in the summer a powder foundation works best so I don't get oily.  This one is PERFECT under powder foundation!  I initially thought it was too thick...but after my skincare absorbs, I apply this with a smaller liquid foundation brush and it spreads easily it really helps to blur imperfections.  It sets in a few minutes and my powder foundation applies like silk on top of it and leaves me with a beautiful satin finish, which I absolutely love. * I want to love this product but I just can't. I've tried it twice and my face breaks out horribly when I use it. I thought maybe it was another product I used but it isn't. It clogs pores and the more days in a row I use it, the worse the breakouts are."
21,la roche-posay,anthelios melt-in milk body and face sunscreen spf 60,pimprod2018267,2570181," * No scent.  Super lightweight.   Not greasy.  An amazing body spf I don't mind putting on.  Only downside is the price * it does its job but its very expensive for what it is. considering it does kinda leave a white cast and it starts stinging your eyes when in contact with water. * My husband loves it * After countless times of trying to find SPF's that don't break me out and don't break the bank, I decided to try this one because it was recommended and I am SO GLAD I DID. This does not break me out and it doesn't pill up on me. I only put this on my face so I cannot share how it feels/wears on the body or if it stains clothes. I am also a pale gal, so it doesn't leave a whitecast on my skin or settle into my skin weird. I also don't always tend to be outside, so I cannot share if it protects against the sun extremely well. When I know I'm going to be in the sun for long periods of time, I ALWAYS double up on SPF with a different product, so it has some help and I haven't experienced any sunburn issues with this. I personlly love this SPF; the only complaint is it is slightly pricey and the packaging isn't the greatest. * I bought this product thinking is was gonna be life changing but definitely waste of money, I've tried to use it alone, with products or makeup and it always peels and leaves me with a slight white cast in my opinion theres better options out there * I love it ! It's my first time using it and it works great with my moisturizer and under my primer I'm very oily and this is amazing I don't get super shiny * I have been looking for safe sunscreens to use with clean ingredients. I was so excited to try this and even though it's very expensive, I was willing to try it anyway.  I barely used any today and I broke out in a rash."
22,e.l.f. cosmetics,suntouchable whoa glow broad spectrum spf 30 sunscreen,pimprod2036596,2605491," * Only product on my face and its peeling as if i rubbed off dirt off my face. * This was too much glitter for me and the sunscreen didn't appear to be there. Very light coverage especially with other brands that have way better coverage. * I was pleasantly surprised by how much I love this product. It makes your skin glow, and it is light. * I love this because it's a nice light tent and so lightweight I would really recommend this because it works so well, especially when you're out in the sun at the beach so I really recommend this * I bought this thinking it was a dupe for the super goop glowscreen, and while it is a nice product, they look nothing alike. This has glitter in it opposed to just shine. * Sometimes I love this and sometimes it looks like I'm wearing highlight all over my face and look silly.  On my second tube and I'm still on the fence. * I love this product. Its become my go to summer face base. I just wear this with some brow tint and mascara during the summer. Its wonderfully quick and easy and affordable."
23,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen body spf 40 invisible sun protection,pimprod2038031,2606364," * I was so excited when I found this sunscreen. I received a sample size for my face and used the whole bottle. It was great! Then I bought the body sunscreen for my vacation and after the first use I realized what an expensive mistake it was. It didn't absorb well and left greasy, chunky residue all over my body. It looked like my entire body was peeling from a bad sunburn. This is a very expensive sunscreen for it to not be usable. I don't want to hang out in a public location looking like my skins peeling and I'm shading chunky skin cells all over a public pool. Gross!! * Goes on light.  Not greasy and doesn't leave white residue like some sunscreens do. * I do really like this sunscreen- it's like a clear gel with a velvety finish (think primer consistency). It's rather expensive though for what you get- considering it's a body sunscreen, this wouldn't even get you through a week at the beach. * No matter which supergoop I try they are heavy greasy they do block the sun but feel horrible * Me gusta mucho, no deja la piel grasosa, te da brillo y protege * Absolutely terrible! I broke out in a rash about an hour after using. Theew it away immediately! * I love the OG unseen sunscreen for my face and its the perfect texture and viscosity. I was hoping this would be too. I hate the lotion texture of others so i was really excited that SG came out witb this. The only problem is that its just oily… it absorbs well and makes my skin feel REALLY SOFT but since i do sweat pretty easily it can feel a bit slick at times. Maybe its the olive oil in it? Or its just too many oils."
24,kopari beauty,sun on the run sunscreen travel kit,pimprod2043796,2618937," * Wanted to try the roll on stick, its not great though. Its very oily and never dried down, not great for on the go and would stain your clothes. It does have glitter in it which i thought was cute and fun, didnt bother me since i wanted this for a disney trip to be fun anyways. The serum is fantastic, i ended up returning this set snd buying that full size. It doesn't give any shimmer which is misleading since it looks shimmery in the bottle. But it protects well, high spf, dries down quickly and felt moisturizing. * Literally the most amazing sunscreen ever! Your skin feels smooth and not greasy. * bought this to test the products instead of buying the full sizes separately. I dont find the sun shield body glow to give much of a glowy look. the stick does give off some shimmer/glitter. also I've found these products dont really settle in my skin and makes me sweat more. I do wish this kit came in the darker shades * I feel like I got a really great deal because I got the full size stick, which I love!  It took a couple of swipes but love how portable this stick is and the glow.  I always wanted to try their other sun products so I'm happy I got a chance to * Love the options in this kit! it's perfect for the summer. All the ingredients are clean and moisturizing, but not sticky. * My bumps on my chest came overnight . Theyre not normal, it will take MONTHS to get rid of these hard crators ! :( * Both of the face products apply wonderfully and work well under makeup. I have been looking for sunscreen with glitter and the stick gives a subtle sparkle without looking like you got attacked by a child's craft project. The price is also great - you get enough product to try before you decide if you want a full size."

I broke out so bad with small heat rash all over my face. It looks so bad and looks like hives. Totally would not recommend. * I put this on 3x daily. A lot of people don't realize that wearing sunscreen everday isnt only for sun protection. its for hydration. And holy cow. This stuff is perfect. I have very dry skin, but not anymore. This stuff saved my face. I wash my face AM and PM. Put on toner, brightening serum and hello sunshine in the AM. Mid/late afternoon, i rinse my face, sprtiz on toner then reapply hello sunshine. PM i wash my face, toner, brightening serum, estee lauder under eye, estee lauder face moisturizer, and again, hello sunshine.

I found as an actual primer it didn't do much for me, but maybe that is user error. My biggest complaint is that it makes me breakout on my chin, but I have sensitive skin and am yet to find sunscreen that works perfectly on my face. * This product goes on smoothly, no white cast and doesn't clog my pores or cause irritation. I use this every day. Bottle lasts a long time and there's no chemical smell. * Ive tried so many sunscreens, and this one by far is the best one ever! It feels so smooth, it doesnt sting my eyes when i sweat, like other sunscreens do. No piling, and the scent is good. Perfect sunscreen! ☀️"

Non greasy and breathable. I stock up every spring and throughout the summer. * It glides on over makeup without moving it. I had my partner and sister try it over thier makeup and it didnt disturb it. My gfs makeup is dewy and my sisters is matte. Worked for them both. I love it aswell bc it doesnt break me out. This is my second one * Ive bought two of this product now, and love it. Its lightweight, doesn't burn your eyes, and doesn't clog pores. Lasts a long time too! * I really wish my skin liked this because I loved the glow that it gave my skin after I applied my makeup. but at the end of each day I would find a new bump on my face. I put this on after serum and before moisturizer. Will be returning unfortunately. 😭 * I have turned my family onto this product.  It's light weight and easy to apply and reapply.  Small stick but lasts a long time.  Excellent sun protection. * This is the best face sunscreen ever. I habe repurchased this over and over. The price is high but it lasts forever if its ever one sale BUY it. Ive tried so many and this is the best one for under makeup * Not very greasy. slides on easy. Be sure to get everywhere. I was in a hurry and didn't swipe my entire forehead 😆😆 and it showed."
27,good molecules,sheer mineral sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2037436,2606130," * This blends onto the skin very well and I didnt have any whitecast. I think it works best when you stick to rest of Good Molecules Daily Essentials box plus the cleanser and use this last. Occasionally I felt a little tingling sensation on my skin after applying but haven't had a reaction or stinging eyes like with chemical sunscreens. My skin tends to be oily and this sunscreen didn't make it shinier than usual so that made me happy. I feel bad others didnt have a good experience with it but it's well loved in my routine. * I have oily skin and my skin gets irritated really fast I don't have this problem with this product * Okay facial sunscreen for the price, it hasnt pilled for me and seemed to blend fine with my skincare but it feels heavy on my skin and it DOES leave a white cast. I'll finish the full tube but I wont be re-purchasing. * I recieved this in my Freebies Bag with my order and was excited to try it.... this excitement quickly died. I rubbed it in fully (slight white cast but I worked it in and it went away) but even after laying out to tan so it would fully soak into my skin, got in the pool and when getting back out, hello Casper the friendly ghost. Streaks of white all over me. Truly can say I've never had anything like that before. I'll finish out what I have cause I hate to waste but absolutely will not be purchasing and wouldn't recommend anyone purchase it. * Not a true Mineral Sunscreen! Good molecules why would you put Chemical Butyloctyl Salicylate or any Salicylates into Sunscreen especially a ""Mineral sunscreen""? This gave me a rash. I do not recommend. And it is not Mineral sunscreen, transparency should be practiced when advertising Mineral when ingredients say otherwise. Don't trust your products anymore. * Live this sunscreen doesnt make me feel greasy at all & leaves no ehote cast, the only thing is i wish it csme in a higher coverage like 50. * I got this as a gift to try out, and personally, I didn't enjoy the product. As someone with a medium skin tone, this suncreen left a pretty noticeable white cast. I also have very dry, eczema prone skin and this left my skin flaky and dry, and kind of itchy afterwards. Overall, just not for me, but it might work if you have a different skin type."
28,coola,classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 50,pimprod2012268,2561101," * I have easy to burn skin, so I'm always on the hunt for a good sunscreen.  This Coola one is the best so far.  I even forgot to reapply and still didn't burn.  I love that it goes on completely clear and it doesn't feel greasy.  I just wish it was a little more affordable, but it's still worth the money. * The product itself is amazing. Used it 3 times and it is almost empty, for the price it fell like a total rip off * This sunscreen smells totally not. Like .sunscreen. Just smells really fresh and delicious and all while keeping you safe in the sun ! Wow. A tad pricey so I keep it for myself ! * After suffering stinky chemical smelling SPF sprays, I finally tried this brand. Twice the price but so worth it. Smells like heavenly Guava Mango and that's it. It outlasts the 80 minute rec time, is moisturizing and allows for tan with no burn. * Fragrance free. Not sticky or greasy. My skin felt like I hadn't applied sunscreen. My new go to sunscreen spray. * I've tried quite a few sunscreens, and the COOLA Suncare Classic Sunscreen Spray Fragrance-Free Broad Spectrum SPF 50 is definitely one of my favorites! I love that it provides broad-spectrum protection with SPF 50, which gives me peace of mind knowing I'm well-protected during outdoor activities.

What really stands out to me is how lightweight and non-greasy it feels on my skin. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a sticky residue like other sunscreens I've tried. Plus, the fragrance-free formula is perfect for anyone who is sensitive to strong scents or just doesn't want to smell like sunscreen all day. I can apply it generously without worrying about any overpowering fragrance.

The spray nozzle also makes it super easy to apply, especially when I'm on the go or need to reapply throughout the day. I've used it on both my face and body, and it's been gentle, with no irritation or breakouts. It's also water-resistant, which is a must for me when I'm spending time at the pool or beach.

Overall, I highly recommend this sunscreen for anyone looking for reliable sun protection that's easy to use, gentle on the skin, and fragrance-free. It's definitely a staple in my summer skincare routine! * This was the worst sunscreen I ever used. I brought it to Hawaii because it is reef safe and applied it to my husband and I. He complained about the alcohol smell. We applied/reapplied as directed and both got bad sunburns- his even blistered!"

The issue is that I expected to get at least four applications out of it. She went to the pool for one day and used it three times and it came home empty. Admittedly, the can was light when I bought it, but since it had the original plastic wrap on it, I assume it was a ""full"" can, and for three applications at this price, I won't be buying it again. * It's a good sunscreen that leaves your skin soft and shiny. * So I bought  this product  for my vacation  and I used  it cause I was really burned  and so I put it on and I got a rash and the next day I was more burned than ever and it felt  like there was no spf. * I took this product on vacation and after four of us applied the bottle was empty! * Took this with on my vacation to Punta Cana. Ran out after 2 days of use between my husband and I. Good coverage, but gone way too quick for the price paid. * I boight this forbmy daughter to ise since we mived from Ga to Fl.  She used it that morning and bu the time she for home from school her face was covered in rash. She has oily amd sensitive skin.

But it seems to work its way into my eyes, and it stings for a long time. I don't think I will buy it again, but it is good enough. * Thats all jusy buy it! * purchased this due to the spf rating. I use Olay sensitive during the winter months and usually add Neutrogena SPF, but I found this product this spring and decided to try it. I absolutely love. I use serum first and then this. I absorbs nicely and doesn't leave my skin sticky. I use under my eyes and my eye lids and I do not experience any burning. I occasionally use powder foundation and it holds all day. the scent is nice and not over powering like other products."

I went on a 5 day cruise with some friends and spent many hours every day at the pool while using this and did not burn once!!! I rarely can spend more than 3 hours out in the sun without burning; even with reapplying every hour. It was a bit greasy but left my skin so hydrated and shimmery. This Florida girl will definitely be buying it again. * Thei product is awesome. Being someone who has dry skin, this is a game changer. You have to use a couple pumps but its amazing. Trust me. Run, don't walk to get this product. I hope you enjoy. * I bought this looking for a shimmer oil… this does not shimmer at all. You look shiney from it being oli… but no sparkle. Its greasy and doesnt dry down. * Love the coverage and sheen. Would love to see a version with a golden hour sent. * Amazing quality! , smells great also not sticky at all :) * Never dries down, wipes off on everything. Serious doubts about this offering decent sun protection since it doesnt stay on your skin. GREASY. * Not good.. stains your clothes."
33,la roche-posay,anthelios ultra light sunscreen lotion spray spf 60,pimprod2018266,2570213," * This applies well and feels like nothing on the skin. Would definitely repurchase. * The only sunscreen my sunscreen-averse husband will use. He finds it convenient to spray (his face, bald head, body, everywhere), it absorbs quickly when rubbed in, and it is the most effective one at preventing burns of the many we have tried. * Ive given this sunscreen many chances and everytime it gets into my eyes. It burns for a while too. As soon as you use a towel/rag to soothe your eyes a minute later they'll start burning again. This can happen for hours. Wanted to love this because it doesn't leave a white cast if you rub it in enough, but the eye burning isn't worth that. * i bought this in store at the beginning of summer after an employee recommended it to me. i'm a natural redhead, so im pretty pasty and prone to skin cancer/burning easy. i was hesitant because it was super pricy - but a little goes a long way!!! i work outside in the sun all day and have every day for the summer, and i havent burnt ONCE since buying and actively using this. i still have over half the bottle after 2/3 months. it is so worth the money. * I really wanted to like this BUT I've used it a few times and for some reason, after about an hour, even though I'm not sweating, this sunscreen starts to get in my eyes and even my mouth! Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation. It has Benzophenone in it, which can cause contact  dermatitis. I get an allergic reaction on my eyelids every time I've used this product. * OMG this is the best sunscreen I've found for my skin, it's refreshing and soft and doesn't leave your skin white or thought of it. I loved it"
34,coola,organic classic face sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2003902,2541377," * Easy to apply. Absorbs quickly leaving no white cast. Keeps my fair skin from burning even in intense sun at the beach. I was allergic to the reformulation of another ""sensitive skin"" sunscreen brand that I had been using for years. No problems with Coola. It also does not run in my eyes when doing yard work on hot days. Putting sunscreen on to protect my skin is no longer a chore.  My beach-loving hair stylist recommended Coola. She knows!!! * This product absorbs nicely, but throughout the day will pill. I don't wear any other products under or on top of sunscreen, so it's undeniably this product. Super disappointing, especially given the price. Won't buy again. * This is a clean sunscreen that feels like skincare and is fragrance-free. For a skin comparison - my skin is normal to dry and very fair with freckles. Sunburns would be common for my skin if I didn't wear this every day. * This is one of the few face sunscreens I've tried that doesn't burn my eyes, even when I sweat!! 

It applies so easily and doesn't leave a film OR make my skin feel tight and dry. The consistency is somewhere between a lotion and an average sunscreen; takes no time to apply (and layers well over my other skincare) and hasn't left me with a white cast so I don't need a mirror to slap it on.

So far, it hasn't broken me out or given me any kind of reaction and I've been using it almost daily for about two weeks.

As someone who has always hated how sunscreen feels, this one had made getting into the habit easy and enjoyable. I plan on investing in the body formula too. Highly recommend!! * Purchased this to wear for hiking and outdoor activities. As a dark skin gal, no white cast is crucial. And this delivers well. Doesn't feel heavy or too greasy. When I sweat, there's no white streaks. Didn't break out from wearing this, but I don't wear it all day. * No white cast.  I do wish it was rated better on EWG.  Nice feel, no white case and lightweight. * Ive been using this spf for over 6 months, I have acne prone skin and combination skin. Its not super greasy and it doesnt break me out, but if you like to wear it under heavy makeup, it might not be for you. Ive noticed that it will pill very heavily and cause splotchy patches in my bronzer/blush products, which can be annoying. But I did wear this spf to an outdoor music festival for a week and it did great! 7/10"

I love the way this feels on my dry skin. I got as a gift with purchase but once i run out i am buying it. I have sensitive dry skin and loved this. I am also a medium complexion latina and this did not leave a white cast. * If you're sensitive to smells this is not for you. I saw a few other reviews that said the same thing but still tried it. Its so heavily fragranced that I had a headache all day from it, even after wiping it off. * It has butyloctyl salicylate a uv filter that is chemical and it gave me a horrendous skin rash. Also I think the smelly ingredient is undecavertol a fragrance that also irritates my skin. I mean leave out both these ingredients and then call it a mineral sunscreen. Not worth it and do not recommend due to not being honest about the ways it's being sold as a mineral sunscreen when it has chemical filters in it. * I love the Vacation brand and they have never disappointed me. I wanted to try this because I had heard so much about it and I love it :)  

If you are sensitive to smells, you might find the fragrance a little much. It smells really good to me, and it didn't bother me. I also couldn't smell it after I applied it or the rest of the day. It wears really well and it doesn't burn my eyes which is a huge factor for me when deciding on sunscreen purchases. * The fragrance is why I am returning this sunscreen. And my skin doesn't tolerate the chemical ingredient Butyloctyl Salicylate. This is the 3rd mineral sunscreen I have tried to have this ingredient in it. My skin doesn't like this chemical ingredient, so I'm disappointed they say it is a mineral sunscreen when it is not. I do not recommend if you want a true Mineral sunscreen and fragrance free one. * This is the best SPF ive been able to find. My skin is currently adjusting to prescription grade retinols and I love the skin barrier friendly ingredients. Ive been using it a few months and just repurchased my second bottle. I think the price point is good for how long it lasts too. My biggest complaint is the fragrance. It doesn't smell bad, but I would prefer a fragrance free version. * You know the gamble, buying online and hoping things are what you thought - unfortunately this one didn't hit for me. I thought the bottle would be larger (that's my error) but what really got me was the smell. I'm not usually picky with scents, but this sunscreen smelled unexpectedly and surprisingly bad. Very chemically smelling. I used it once and was so off put that I immediately put it back in the box to return. Sorry Shake Shake - this sunscreen didn't ""shake"" it for me."

This was recommended to me by a coworker and an Ulta employee separately. I've been using it for a year and swear by it - I like that it doesn't have a scent, moisturizes well, and most importantly, has NEVER irritated my eyes. This is my go to. Cannot recommend enough. Love it so much that I've gifted it to my siblings. * I have used other products of this brand and was hoping this would be a one treatment before makeup. Unfortunately it created a peeling like feeling combined with my makeup which has never happened before. 

I also feel like it makes my face red. 

The one thing I like most is the design, jar allows you to get every drop of product which is appreciated! * I've tried applying this alone and with my regular skincare routine and it pills up under makeup no matter what. Seems fine alone but still got kind of peely on the neck. * The first half of this jar was perfect but the closer i got to being halfway through this product it began to pill. Was pretty upset * This is my fIrst review. I have spent thousands on skincare for fine lines and milia. I have had lasers, injections, etc. This cream has completely erased my fine lines and almost completely eradicated years of milia around my eyes. I have my best friend hooked and I will never purchase a different cream. With that being said, it is not for sensitive skin. In my experience, anything that is this effective is not going to be gentle. I do not have sensitive skin. I can feel some burn, but no redness or reaction. I am 48 and I now have my skin back from my early 30s. I only wish that i would have had this then. * I haven't had any issues with this product besides the fact that it has a pretty bad smell to it so it's not enjoyable to put on. * I was super excited to use this moisturizer as it had SPF in it. But I am utterly disappointed. It caused severe eye irritation that i had to go see an ophthalmologist. No sunscreen has caused me such reaction so i was worreid. However i do think it's a good moistirozer with SPF but its just not for me."

Im extremely hard to tan no mayter how long I stay out in the sun. I was out for like 2 hours and I BURNT lol I sprayed it on twice too. So yea, it works just be mindful. Def wiñl purchase again * I LOOOOOVE this product. I'm obsessed with all Coco and Eve products. This smells so good. It makes my skin so soft and gives a natural and pretty glow. Plus it protects from the sun. I use this every day! * Took this oil on my cruise the best of the best inonly use braIllian products and this ia close to it amazing smelling glowing tan * I never tanned so fast. Omg. * Im on the hunt for the best tanning oil and previously I tried bali body, however today I layed outside for an hour with this nice smelling oil and I believe I tanned better. Im yet to try Maui Babe, but from what I have came across this is a great tanning oil im just not sure if its the best considering the price. * Love this product. Works very well. Good for fair skin or skin that burns easily. * Love this oil!! It created an even tan while moisturizing my skin beautiful. In love with the smell. 

Cons- not water proof and cap cracked and disintegrated with the heat and oil."
39,vacation,instant vacation browning lotion spf30 body sunscreen,pimprod2043686,2620523," * I bought this thinking it was an accelerator. It's not I use it before I go in the tanning bed. Honestly, I don't think it really does anything but make a mess and I don't like the way it smell smells smells chocolatey stinks. Gets on everything doesnt matter if its wet or dry i honestly can never get it to lather right it always leaves streaks im thinking of returning it and trying to find an accelerator * Normally love Vacation brand, and I got this thinking it would be like the Australian Gold style light bronzer. However this was deeply tinted and very wet so the formula got everywhere. It stained my beach chair, my swimsuit and somehow even some stainless steel water bottles. I think this might work if you apply after exfoliating, and still undressed. But even when it got wet from the beach, it loosened and started staining again. Wont be using this again. * Well if you want to look like you got the worst spray tan of your life you might be ok with this. Very orange, patchy and does not go on nicely, gets EVERYWHERE. Not even slightly sweat proof or transfer proof * I can see how this product would be incredible for a person who is on the paler side and has a hard time tanning/browning in the sun or is prone to burning. If that's you, get this. However if you are a brown person who tans well and you want a deeper tan, this browning lotion is not for you. 

The lotion goes on VERY brown and for a second I thought I had gotten self tanner. It gives you an instant self tanner brown. It smells ok, but also gives self tanner vibes in the scent department. You have to really work this lotion in otherwise it looks streaky. It also STAINS absolutely everything. If you're using this to tan, make sure you apply one side at a time (front, lay down, wash off, back, lay down, wash off). Once you get wet this thing is not going on very well at all. It will require you to wait until your skin or the lotion dries down so you can work it in. 

The tan itself is not a deep tan, this is not an accelerant probably due to the SPF. 

If you are looking for a deeper tan, I recommend the Maui babe browning lotion instead (but please use spf with that one as it doesn't have any built in) * Yes, this will make you tan while it's on-then streaky when it's wet from either water or applying more sunscreen. PLUS it'll stain everything you love. I will stick to actual self tanner, not this staining trainwreck. Consider this your warning * This stuff is absolutely terrible. How this got approved is beyond me. Yes it gives you color BUT its so streaky, doesn't blend in very well and it comes off on literally anything that touches it, wet or dry. Do not waste your time or money on this. * This stuff is messy and isn't a long lasting solution. The color is perf if you're looking for a quick fix for photos or something. But it comes off super easy, don't wear white."
40,sun bum,daily 50 body lotion,pimprod2043280,2619925," * I LOVE the smell of Sunbum sunscreen so i was stoked to find the daily lotion.  It smells exactly like the sunscreen, is lightweight and doesnt leave my skin feeling greasy. I also like that it offers some sun protection as im in an out of the sun quite often. * I needed a moisturizer and an SPF so thought this would perfect! After a few wears, I realized it didnt provide me with any sun protection because i would turn red and burn much like when i dont wear sunscreen, particularly my chest. I figured i do like the scent and the non-greasy feel so ill just finish the bottle as a moisturizer. Sadly this has caused my skin to dry out more than if i used NO moisturizer and I am not just disappointed but shocked. I usually use Cera Ve and I feel like my skin has never been more dry and scaly, EVER, than with consistent use of this product. :( 

There is absolutely NO reason I would ever buy this and I never like to waste product but this is going. * Wanted a light,non greasy spf lotion for hands and arms. This is a winner. Smells nice but can't smell unless I put my hands to my nose and I prefer it that way.  Have bought Sun Bum spf lip balm in the past and always loved it,now I can add their spf body lotion to my favorite list of products. * I use this product every single day. I've bought at least 5 bottles this summer. Its a true holy grail. Its not sticky. It never ever pills. I love how smooth,soft and well protected it makes my skin feel. Very comfortable. It leaves begind a soft,dewy sheen. I have not burned once while wearing it. It's excellent for use anytime you're not in/by the water. (You could, but I would use traditional sunscreen for that.) It smells amazing as all Sunbum products do. That fades rather quickly so it doesn't interfere with perfume. I do wish this product were available in a larger size,but at least it's in a pump. * I have sensory issues that make me more sensitive to how products feel on my skin. The vast majority of sunscreens feel sticky or greasy in some way, but I push through those feelings because wearing sunscreen is extremely important. Enter this sunscreen. SPF50, pleasant to apply, and NOT GREASY AT ALL! I would love if this formula came in different sizes so I can travel with it. Sun Bum nailed it with this one! * I am super surprised that this lotion is as good as it is. Im really picky about my choice of sunscreen, well let me tell you this is a high quality moisturizer for me and I've been using it each morning! My skin feels great and it protects me, I haven't been sunburned since using it. I reapply if I'm outside working and sweating, so make sure to do that! Yes I recommend, I'm already ordering a 2nd bottle, you get a lot of product for a low price compared to others on the market. This works as well as, or better than prestige brands, IMO. Its non greasy and actually moisturizing too! Really happy i took a chance on this one. I live in Southern California and the sun is always out, so wearing sunscreen is not an option! * Love the scent and how easily it applies (like any typical lotion).  The pump is amazing - loved it for putting lotion on me and the kids before we left the house.  Everyone would comment on the wonderful beachy scent (banana/coconut)."
41,supergoop!,daily essentials spf starter kit,pimprod2036549,2603598," * It is a great way to try a product but honestly not for everyone. I have combination skin and found myself disliking the sticky, heavy feeling. * The setting mist bottle does not spray. It is 30 minutes to my nearest Ulta store to return. Frustrating purchase! * I live on an island and absolutely don't leave the house without sunscreen, but I've never found a product that I loved for my face until now. I have combination skin and Unseen Sunscreen has become my new daily. It is smooth as silk and feels identical to Smashbox primer, if you've tried that. It absorbs almost immediately but leaves my skin soft and ready for makeup, but I think it blurs well enough that l dont need makeup (I'm in my 40's). This little sample tube has lasted me two weeks of daily use and it's finally running low. I use an amount the size of my index nail and it's enough for my face, neck, and the backs of my hands. I read some reviews questioning the SPF value, but they seemed unfounded and I wonder if those reviewers were using authentic product. 

Yesterday I went out boating for four hours and I relied only on this little kit. The Refresh spray was nice for reapplication, which I only remembered once, halfway through the day. I didn't get burned at all, even under these harshest conditions. 

The Play Everyday lotion was fine. It worked well and I definitely would have burned without it, as I missed a few spots and am absolutely fried. It just doesn't stand out above other sunblocks to me. 

Nonetheless, I'm very happy that I ordered this kit. These aren't cheap products but the quality is excellent and I don't skimp on skincare. This kit allows you to try each and see how your skin responds before investing in larger sizes. * These are so small they should be free samples. I haven't even used them yet, but I should have looked more closely at the size before ordering. The price is way too high for these tiny bottles. You will basically get one or two applications with each. * I have bought this twice and it is such good value and it lasts a while. * I love this product but the bag (a big asset on why I bought this set) is an ok sized bag that feels cardboardy. The sizes of the products are pretty reasonable. The ""Unseen Sunscreen"" is very soft and silky. None of the products leave my skin with white cast or oil and grease. My skin feels amazing after using this product. I would recommend this set or even the full size of all these products. Over I would recommend this! * Cheap way to try 3 sunscreens! Loved both the lotions but wasn't a big fan of the spray. It felt greasy."
42,e.l.f. cosmetics,suntouchable all set for sun spf 45,pimprod2039944,2611368," * Ive been looking for a sunscreen spray/mist for an easier application & also for reapplying on the go. Ive seen recommendations of this product everywhere on tiktok.. some even claimed it was good for sensitive skin. The first time i sprayed this on my face it stug my eyes a little but i gave it the benefit of the doubt because i had other products on my face. But this morning i washed my face & put on my usual moisturizer.. i let it dry down then spray this on my face avoiding my eyes but some managed to drip in.. it burns so much.. i rinsed my eyes multiple times but i think it clung on to my eyelashes bc it stopped for bit but it was itchy.. i even took a antihistamine bc i thought it would help.. it just kept irritating me so i rewashed my face again, reapplied my moisturizer, & the usual sunscreen i use that doesnt irritate me. No itching anymore. My eyes dont burn or anything.. * Yikes. I bought this for a river trip and loved the convenience of having it in a spray since I sweat a lot and didn't want to burn my face. Well, I didn't get my wish because instead of a sunburn this absolutely trashed my skin on my face, neck, and chest. I woke up the day after using it and my eyes were so swollen and itchy that it was alarming. My skin also was red, very itchy, and had a really horrible bumpy texture. I use the Suntouchables Whoa Glow SPF primer and it's an absolute favorite of mine but this spray is pretty horrible. * It's a setting spray.  It's quick drying. I am not sure I've experienced either.  Definitely close lips so that you don't get the residue on your lips.  If not, your waterproof multi-hour lipstick will be easy to come off.  It stings the face when you spray it on.  It doesn't last long but still.  My face has mini white dots all over that do eventually dry out.  My face is shiny.  And then I try to remove the shine, my makeup comes off.  So… My makeup stays on for the most part outside of that.  I'll finish the bottle just for the sunscreen benefit. * I really wanted to love this because it is such an affordable SPF spray but the smell is horrible! Smells very chemically and I couldn't get the smell out of my nose 30 minutes after spraying on my face. It did leave a pretty glow on my face but the smell is too strong for me to get past. Usally love e.l.f. products but this is a miss for me, definitely returning :( * great for an affordable sunscreen spray but its burns face so bad and smells of alcohol. will use for scalp and neck spray but not for the face. * Horrible experience with this. It absolutely burns so bad on your skin. It doesnt stop burning for hours. Would not recommend. I usually love everything Elf but this a no for me. * I really wanted to love this setting spray, but it burns my face, eyes, and lips (even when doing the crazy-suck-in-my-lips and close my eyes face) they would burn for some reason? I usually like the smell of SPF but this one is too much. It feels slick and slippery on the face. My makeup breaks up a lot when I use this (I've tried 3 different foundations/skin tints with it). The spray bottle also doesnt seem to mist very well. Wanted to love this but unfortunately it's a no."
43,sun bum,face mist spf 45,pimprod2021621,2575599," * I got the for the first time in a little Sun Bum travel kit and fell in love with it. It's nice for a little refresher when you're out and about, but then it also works for a reapplication of sunscreen for the rest of your body when you're out and about. When I take my kids to the pool, we lotion up before we go. But every hour, during the breaks, I make sure and reapply to everyone's faces and then go ahead and use it everywhere use (shoulders, back front, arms....). Same thing at Disney, as we're waiting in line for rides, we'll reapply. Since it's not aerosol, I feel like I have more control of it. I also can take this to sporting events because we're not allowed to have aerosol sprays at Kauffman Stadium when we go watch the Royals play. We're are pale people and this has helped keep us sunburned, lol * Would never recommend this for someone to use on face. The irritation this sunscreen causes for my eyes could nt even be flused out. I wore this once to the beach and it scarred me from trying other face spray sunscreen. Wanted to love it and its sleak design. Using its for thr back of my hands and tops of my feet * This product sincerely feels like you sprayed hairspray into your eyes, except that might be better because at least hairspray wouldn't repeatedly run into you eyes throughout the day. Even when blocking your eyes while spraying, this product is so oily that it ultimately ends up stinging them anyway. * burns if it gets in my eyes - kinda itchy. * While this sunscreen can look a little on the greasy side if you overdo it, adding the right amount can turn a bare face kind of day into a clean girl day instantly * Why make a face spray that when people spray it on their face it burns their eyes so bad they can't open them for 30+ minutes?! * I bought this wanting a misting sun screen with a higher SPF that I could spray over my makeup during the day. DO NOT USE THIS WITH MAKEUP! It made my mascara and eyeliner run like CRAZY! On top of that, the scent was extremely strong and every time I would use it, it would burn my lips. This is the case with any Sun Bum product (for me anyways); sensitive skin around my eyes, nose and lips would burn HORRIBLY. If you're sensitive to achohol and fragrance STEER CLEAR of this product."
44,coola,scalp & hair mist organic sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2012274,2561108," * Has a pleasant smell andn doesn't leave hair feeling greasy. * Remember when you were dragged to church and all the ladies had on different perfumes and you were forced to sit there for two hours? This is that experience in a bottle. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. * Love this product * This product is great. It keeps my scalp from burning. The scent isnt horrible. The only thing i dont love is how my scalp feels when i put it on. Kinda like hairspray but tacky too. Overall i would recommend this product. I have bought multiple times & made some family buy too! * Love this product.  Reliably keeps my scalp from burning with just a few well-placed spritzes.  Herbal smell dissipates quickly, and I'm careful to avoid spraying too much so I don't get greasy hair.  Also works as a quick SPF spray on neck/shoulders in a pinch. * The actual SPF in this product works well for my hair and scalp, but tell me how is this a sunscreen bottle and the paint on it MELTS when it's in a bag that's hardly even in direct sunlight. The bottle constantly leaks as well, and the scent can be nauseating, especially when it spilled all over other stuff in my bag. * I have androgenic alopecia and Tellugen effluvium. I do not always want to wear a hat/scarf/wig,especially while swimming. I definitely no longer wear swim caps as they are too hard on my delicate hair. This product protects my scalp under some very thin patches. It smells amazing. Herbal but fresh as well. The scent dissipates rather quickly. The mist is a pump and it is very fine and consistent. if you are careful with placement and apply evenly it will not become greasy. My hair is very thin,if it's greasy you are using too much and you are spraying on the hair not the scalp. Maybe get someone to help with application if this is happening. Anyway, my scalp has not burned all summer and I have started using it on my whole family. It's pricey,yeah,Coola isnt cheap,but it's a very high quality/performance product line. I will repurchase this and the spf setting spray for a long time to come."
45,vacation,shimmer oil spf 30 sunscreen,pimprod2045400,2623027," * The design of the bottle isn't good it squirts everywhere when you try to use it ..the product itself isn't has oily or silky like I expected * I recently saw this in store as my mom was the one who tested it on her arm, she was perfecly fine. I didnt buy it that day so i ordered it online. It came in i tried it on the section of one arm and i broke out in hives towards it hurts when i itch it. Ive had the hives for 2 days going on 3 just from the product. I will be returning as it also doesnt stick to skin and feels eh in my opinion. * I got an allergic reaction using this. Aside from that this has way too much glitter instead of being glowy. * I grew up tanning with oil and now I'm much kinder to my skin and I'm making sure to use sunscreen religiously. I missed the feeling of oiling up when laying out so this is perfect. I still feel like I'm ""tanning"" but with my skin protected unlike when I would use tanning oil with no spf. The shimmer is very pretty and the scent is fantastic! I do wish it wad slightly richer and more moisturizing though. * Looks great on hands and arms and legs. I didn't like how oily it was on my face and it's not water resistant. Would def. Consider buying again. * Broke me out with hives on my honeymoon.. 
the glitter is pretty though but i was itchy and red for days. * I didn't expect to like this product as much as I do. It feels light and airy on the skin and adds the perfect amount of shimmer/glow to the skin surface. 

Would purchase this again. The scent is SOO good and transports you to a tropical island"

48,live tinted,"hueguard 3-in-1 mineral sunscreen, moisturizer, primer spf 30",pimprod2028585,2588656," * This product has worked AMAZINGLY for me. I have oily skin, but it works great as a primer and my makeup goes on great after using it. I am half Puerto Rican, and do have skin that's on the darker side of things, so I could see how it might look orange on people with fairer skin, however it does work great on me. I do hate how expensive it is, but I do feel like I get a lot of uses out of it. * This product in itself is decent. For my skin (Caucasian, mid-30's, combination skin), the tint was fine. There was no white cast on me, nor any orangey shift, either. The product did seem to emphasize pores and dry areas. But the major problem for me came after: the breakouts! I broke out all over my face after using this, and pretty severely at that. It's taken weeks to clear up. This was the only new item in my routine, so it was easy to isolate the cause. A definite NO for me! * I struggle to find a sunscreen that wont make my eyes water and burn if I put anything with spf near my eyes. Even with some mineral sunscreens it still hurts my eyes. NOT THIS!!! I can literally rub this on my eye lids and have no reaction. I got this as a birthday sample and fell in love. * I wanted to love this product as I am looking for a sunscreen for rosacea. Unfortunately, I gave me a white cast for my olive complexion skin tone. It might work better for lighter skin tones. On the positive side, it was easy to apply, it feel comfortable on my skin, and it did not break me out. It is mineral so it took a little bit to remove, I did double cleansed. 4 stars for how the product make my skin feel. I would recommend for a lighter skin tone. * This sunscreen felt great on my sensitive skin, but definitely left a noticeable cast on my skin tone (Fitzpatrick V). The cast was definitely not as bad as other non-nano zinc sunscreens, but it was more noticeable than nano zinc sunscreens I've tried. The cast partially fades after waiting for some time but it definirely reduces my skin's radiance. I would recommend this for skin tones lighter than mine, but not for skin tones deeper than mine. * Non-nano means larger particle zinc oxide. This means: safer, better UVA protection, white cast (larger particle scatter more light = this translates to white cast.

This sunscreen is as good as it gets regarding cancelling out the white cast with minimal tint. No product is 100% perfect, maybe slightly too tinted for very fair skin/ still a slight cast for very dark skin tones. This is as good as it gets.

I have very fair skin and layer this over a sunscreen with a slight cast to cancel out the cast. The finish is beautiful and I feel good knowing the large particle zinc gives good UVA protection and there are no chemical filters absorbing into my bloodstream. * I use this and my face is flawless, glows and blurs my skin."

Its greasy, and i know its not for the face, but if you put any on your face it will migrate into your eyes and it stings badly. * I just had surgery on my back and I will use this to try and reduce the appearance of the scar (my friend recommends it).  I have used this brand before so I'm just gonna give it 5 starssss!!!! * Love it best product ever * Love it best product ever * Sun bum is the best * Love this product * Heard it smelled great, but it doesn't.

It's not greasy or smelly, and it doesn't feel heavy on the skin! * I really liked it. It lite weigh. It goes on smooth.  Doesn't feel all icky.  Got my friend buying it now * I really like this product. It's not like other sunscreen lotions that leaves you looking white. It has you very moisturized with a glow. * I absolutely love the matte version, but completely satisfied with the spray as well. It blends n perfectly with my mocha skin and is very effective when I'm out on my nature walks or traveling in my favorite tropical places. * I absolutely love the matte version, but completely satisfied with the spray as well.

51,vacation,chardonnay spf30 lip oil,pimprod2043687,2620560," * It's not at all what it is advertised to be. It smells really bad and does not have a good lip feel. Save your money and get the Aquaphor SPF lip balm instead if the SPF is a big factor for you. * Got this on sale bc i wanted an spf lip product. Unfortunately it smells rancid and literally made me gag. Not sure i even have the words for this smell. Its like sour rotteny garbage with a hint of something vanilla adjacent. Needless to say it is going away. * this lip oil very nice when opening and applying…… however, once it sits on your lips it gives a horrid flavor in your mouth that is difficult to get rid of. I can't wear it anymore because it is that bad. * I was excited to try this. I hated it. It was sticky and smelly. Definitely not what I expect for this price or from this brand. * I LOVED the scent of the product at first but after only a few uses, the scent went BAD. I'm so upset because I loved this lip oil's formula personally. * I like the idea of a lip oil with spf, such a nice summer product to have but it smells like cheese. I can't even eat it because it smells so bad and makes me gag * Smells so disgusting I can't use this. DO NOT BUY"
52,vacation,classic spray spf 50 sunscreen,pimprod2037342,2606405," * I am extremely fair skinned and am a bit of a sunscreen connoisseur. I have tried almost every sunscreen under the sun. I bought this for the rave reviews on the scent- which is still lovely. HOWEVER over the course of 6 hours I liberally reapplied this sunsnscreen 4x during my pool day because everyone kept telling me I was looking burned. Well, they were right. I was severely burned. Other cons: if you rub to blend, it immediately balls up and pills, I had also shaved that AM and applying it to my legs BURNED. I haven't had a sunburn in over 10 years. Will be returning to my other sunscreens. Extremely disappointing especially considering the price. * Works great and smells SO nice!! * I couldnt belive how little sunscreen this bottle contained. I knew it was travel sized but it didnt even last one DAY at the beach. I wouldnt bother wasting your money buying this mini product unless you intend to cut your beach day short or roll the dice on sun poisoning. * I love this product and is now my go to for the pool!!! * I bought this becuase it claimed to be reef safe but is has Octocrylene and Homosalate listed as ingredients……I dont know why companies lie and its so hard to get reef safe sunblock that is actually safe
Companies need to be more honest * I used this sunscreen for the first time while vacation in Florida. I applied liberally and repeated at minimum every two hours,  and immediately after the two times I came out of the pool. I ended up with a very burned back and chest, two areas i an always extremely cautious about. Would not recommend. For perspective , I was at the pool from around  9 until 12 PM and used an entire bottle and seill ended up burning. I am lighter skinned and have had better protection with Hawaiian Tropic for a fraction of the price. * I like the fragrance of this spray but I don't lime the spray nozzle. It clogs up or spits out liquid. I also do t like tgey way it sits snd pills up on my skin. You must be completely dry or it feels and pills like wet paper. Will not repurchase."

As someone with combination skin it would leave a matteish finish but after a few minutes i wouldn't see that matteiah finish and my glow would comeback.

I love it because it is beneficial for my skin as it diminishes pores and allows for smoother makeup application.   The formula is unique and stands out because of its performance.   I highly recommend especially for traveling and busy days. * This is my all time favorite sunscreen. It is so great for everyday and using underneath makeup. It doesnt pill or change the texture of my makeup. Its weightless and it doesnt leave a white cast. Obsessed! Gifted by supergoop * It's good, just not worth money or intrigues me anymore. Burns eyes, makes skin slightly irritated. Wouldn't buy because there's better for sale out there. * I really like this sunscreen. I buy this size, because I think it is too expensive. * i've struggled with finding a face sunscreen for decades. i'll never look elsewhere. feels so good when it goes on (smooth!) and disappears instantly. isn't shiny, isn't matte, doesn't have any sort of cast. no weird smell. makes a great base for makeup and washes off easily."

I have combo skin so I don't apply all over.  I use it as a non-glitter/shimmer highlight on my nose and cheekbones for a fresher look OVER my make up when my face looks ""flat"".  Also use on a fresh face the same way.  And it is AMAZING on my HEALED tattoos...instantly deepens the color, hydrates, and protects.   Stays most the day. * Good dewy sunscreen * It's greasy, causes break outs and doesn't look dewy. You will look like you are greasy. Too expensive to be so bad. * if you want to go to the URGENT CARE wear this product... I got this product from a friend and she said it broke her out. I thought I didn't have sensitive skin in the slightest. I put this product on for a baseball game I went to, I wake up the next day and I have redness and texture around my mouth area. I thought it was just a little breakout that would go away withen a week.... NOPE! I wake up the next day and the previous redness and texture I had got worse and it have moved across my cheeks. It continued like this until it plagued my entire face. I looked like a ballon, it was so bad. I decided that I really needed to go to urgent care to do something about this because it was hot, painful, and so uncomfortable.... I COULD BARLEY OPEN MY EYES!!!! When they finally got to me in the urgent care (2 hours later) we traced my reaction back to the sunscreen I used, I have to get shots and medicine to cure this reaction. Please do your reasearch on whats in this product. * I have had this for just a few days and really like it so far! It's easy for me to apply sunscreen in the morning without getting my hands all gross. The only downside is depending on how much you put on, it takes a while to absorb in your skin/dry. * This product did protect my face from the sun, but hours after I was in the pool it was still greasy! I had to buy a travel bottle of cetaphil cleanser to wash it off! I usually use the sun bum stick, but wanted to try this item after seeing a celebrity going a GRWM video and saw them use this sunscreen!"
56,bubble,solar mate daily mineral spf 40,pimprod2040784,2611777," * So far, this has been a great addition to my skincare. No pilling, no white casting, blends well, not oily or heavy, absorbs fully, and protects from day-to-day sun exposure. I still use a powder foundation over top, but I've been pleased with the effects and lightweight feel of this spf product! * I was really looking forward to this cause it had good reviews and I usually use cerave so I was finding something that maybe a lot better because my cerave sunscreen sometimes had a tendency to peel. I don't know if I got a hold of a bad tube, but the smell was absolutely horrible with this and even after it dried it felt a little tacky to the skin so I will not re-order. Made my skin feel dry as well. I like a more moisturizing sun screen. * Thw reviews say ghat this is a smelly product. But the smell isn't that bad. It feels weightless on the skin. It also looks good under makeup * I started using this about a year ago after learning that sunscreen is the most important part of a morning skin care routine. I LOOOOVE this one! FOR ME PERSONALLY, this doesn't leave any white cast at all, it's not oily or greasy, which is important to me as someone with oily skin, and it dries down to an almost primer-like feel on the skin. My grandmother is in her 80's and she looks like she's in her 60's due to the Zinc SPF protection in her foundation she uses, and that's why I chose this sunscreen with zinc! I want to look like her at that age! The smell doesn't bother me. I see some other reviews talking about how rank it is, but to me, it's really not that bad at all. It's a little chalky smelling, but I feel like all sunscreen has a smell, even if they're not the heavily fragranced ones. I'm about to buy my second tube! * No way they made this, smelled it, and said yes perfect put it on the shelf. Its not even a chemical smell but just rancid. Its also tacky- not weightless. * Bought this wanting a good ""clean"" sunscreen. It smeels like soured clothes or stinky feer when you first put it on. The smell went away for a little while and came back during the day as i had it inder my make up. Will not repurchase or recommend * This sunscreen is perfect for oily skin, has little to no smell and there is no white cast at all. Will definitely buy over and over!!"
57,vacation,chardonnay oil spf 30 sunscreen,pimprod2037343,2606802," * I love this company!!! It smells so good < 3 * I used this while on vacation, I am fair skinned, and diligent at re-applying. This did not provide any sun protection, if anything it amplified my burn. Not the best product from the line I have tried. * I think a lot of people are reviewing this product upon first impression without actually testing out the products sun protection abilities. I tried this numerous times over last summer and while initially the product goes on smooth, it reapplies really poorly. Once you apply the second layer, you start to notice the first layer never fully absorbed and the film it left behind starts to pill and attracts dirt/sand. Beyond that the new layer doesn't seem to really absorb into the skin how it's supposed to so your second layer will leave you very greasy. This is a chemical SPF which means it has to fully absorb into the skin in order to have any sun coverage, but because of the products consistency, it's impossible to reapply. I got sunburnt after trying to use this product numerous times and felt like the SPF element really isn't working especially if you do plan on reapplying through out the day. Beyond that the bottle leaks pretty bad pretty quick so I had to swap it out with a travel bottle. I think this product is probably nice if you're going to be doing some light short-lived activity in the sun, but this should not replace a traditional SPF in your routine because you will wind up greasy dirty and burnt. * i love this spf oil! it makes skin beautiful and shiny and smells amazing! i love wearing this to tan because it hydrates the skin and helps me get color while still protecting against the harmful uv rays. just note that this isn't for use in water — if you're going in the pool or ocean, you'll want to apply a regular lotion or spray spf, too. * if you have sensitive skin i would not recommend. this oil made me break out in stinging hives, very very painful. i was exited to use it but i would just recommend something from the drugstore * When snorkeling in Hawaii our guide told us that the ingredients in this sunscreen were not reef safe. They used Banana Boat Mineral sunscreen. * I see past the only con because I do love this product. I like the orange gele too but find myself grabbing for this one way more."

I instantly loved it. So soft, smooth, blend-able and light. Love how it feels and sinks into my skin. * I thought I liked this but after using it for multiple days in a row, my face started breaking out in white heads and the only thing I can think of is that it's too oily. * Loved the feel and look after applying but broke out next day. I've been looking (for years) for a sunscreen that doesnt aggravate my sensitive skin, but I'll keep looking! * Huge Kopari fan here, but this product caused an epic breakout. Signs were immediate so I only used it one day. Here I am five days later still trying to calm my skin. * Im fairly fair-skinned. I burn then tan. With this stuff my face burned the three timed I used it. It was like putting on tanning oil like we did in the 90s. * I want to love this. I have started to love the brand. I got this because it is summer time and i wanted the extra protection. I am familiar enough with face products to know that you have to let each product absorb into the skin before applying the next. The directions say to use this after your moisturizer however this looks like it is pilling after i apply it. I dont understand that. It does that even if it is dabbed and not rubbed into the skin. I guess it doesnt work well with moisturizer maybe (i use the jeffree star face moisturizer) i guess i have to play around with it to to find a fix even though you shouldnt have to do that to apply a sunscreen. It also feels very greasy when you first apply it and then it soaks into the skin after a while. * cost a lot   for  something  that  smell weird  the exp  day 8/25  they  that  has nothing too do"

It's also really nice cause you can wear it whenever and it's also nice cause you can wear it. * The sunscreen is good for the price point and effective. It does its job well. My only beef with it is thag it separated over time so there is the lotion but and then a liquid portion. I have to mix them together before using. It also goes on kind of greasy. It goes away after a bit but it would be the same result as just using a spray sunscreen with the greasy feel. * Similar to Super Goop but alot cheaper. * Normally I love ELF products and I was hoping this would be a dupe for the unseen suncreen, but unfortunately it's not even close. This sunscreen pills so much it is unusable. It immediately pills up when I put it on my skin to the point where I have to wash my face. I can't see how this can provide any sun protection or be used as a primer under makeup. Avoid. * I use this sunscreen when I don't want high moisture because of riding motorcycle and wearing a helmet, I don't like the feeling of a slick face when I put on and take off helmet. This also great when I am out hiking and seem to sweat in the sun and I don't want a greasy face feel.  Will defiantly purchase again!! * Nice and smooth .  Needed a sunscreen. * For years I've been buying Unseen Sunscreen. The e.l.f  invisible sunscreen is almost an exact dupe with the exception of the amount of coverage. The other product gave me 50 spf and e.l.f gives 35."

I use it on the golf course, beach & at the pool. I am so I tried this product. Its amazing. * I would not purchase this product again. Although the scent/fragrance is lovely, the product did not give the glow I expected. I expected more of a bronzed shimmer, where this product left me shiny, with a greasy look. * Gentle fragrance and no orange!  Use several times per week to build color. * I got an allergic reaction, itchy rashes. My daughter as well had a reaction to it. Try before you buy. * I put the sunscreen on my arms, chest, and back. While it looked and smelled nice, the next morning my skin broke out. I know for sure it's the sunscreen because the rest of my body was clear. * Applied to neck few minutes later its started getting irrated really fast. Fastfoward a few hours later i now have developed a rash-im not pron to sentive skin. * I got this to use for my trip to Hawaii. I had high hopes as it smelled great and looked nice upon first application. While the sunscreen itself worked just fine, this did not provide any glimmery glow, just made me look oily. I also developed a really bad rash/reaction to it after a few days. I had to return it. Even if it doesn't break you out, it did not give me a glow."
61,la roche-posay,anthelios cooling water lotion sunscreen spf 60,pimprod2032917,2599140," * This applies well and feels like nothing on the skin. Would definitely repurchase. * The only sunscreen my sunscreen-averse husband will use. He finds it convenient to spray (his face, bald head, body, everywhere), it absorbs quickly when rubbed in, and it is the most effective one at preventing burns of the many we have tried. * Ive given this sunscreen many chances and everytime it gets into my eyes. It burns for a while too. As soon as you use a towel/rag to soothe your eyes a minute later they'll start burning again. This can happen for hours. Wanted to love this because it doesn't leave a white cast if you rub it in enough, but the eye burning isn't worth that. * i bought this in store at the beginning of summer after an employee recommended it to me. i'm a natural redhead, so im pretty pasty and prone to skin cancer/burning easy. i was hesitant because it was super pricy - but a little goes a long way!!! i work outside in the sun all day and have every day for the summer, and i havent burnt ONCE since buying and actively using this. i still have over half the bottle after 2/3 months. it is so worth the money. * I really wanted to like this BUT I've used it a few times and for some reason, after about an hour, even though I'm not sweating, this sunscreen starts to get in my eyes and even my mouth! Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation. It has Benzophenone in it, which can cause contact  dermatitis. I get an allergic reaction on my eyelids every time I've used this product. * OMG this is the best sunscreen I've found for my skin, it's refreshing and soft and doesn't leave your skin white or thought of it. I loved it"

This also smelled like alcohol and had a sticky texture. A gummy residue was left behind after showering. Not for me. * As a cosmetologist and barber, I've seen my fair share of sunscreens, but COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 is a game-changer!  It's like a tropical vacation in a bottle! The piña colada fragrance is so refreshing and fun, it makes applying sunscreen feel like a treat rather than a chore. Plus, it doesn't have that overpowering chemical smell like some other sunscreens. The spray bottle makes it super easy to apply evenly all over your body, even those hard-to-reach spots. No more awkward contortions trying to reach your back! And because it's organic, I feel good knowing I'm not slathering myself in a bunch of nasty chemicals. The protection. SPF 30 is perfect for everyday wear, whether you're running errands or lounging by the pool. Overall, COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 is a must-have. It smells amazing, applies like a dream, and provides top-notch sun protection. Trust me, once you try it, you'll never want to use another sunscreen again! This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I am loving COOLA right now. This SPF is perfect for this dreadful Texas humidity and heat. It's very lightweight, non-greasy, and has a pleasant scent. Reapplying is a breeze since the product doesn't build up on the skin or cause a film. It's very breathable and works well with general skin sensitivities. The size is quite large for travel, but still small enough to throw in your beach bag and still have space for other necessities. It has a click-locking spray top so it doesn't accidentally spray in your bag. I will say that if your skin is very dry, you may want to go for a cream SPF because this does not provide much moisture. This is definitely made for hot, sunny summers. I love it and I know for sure I am buying a full-sized bottle to keep on hand.

***This review was collected as part of a promotion.*** * As a professional in the beauty industry, I've learned firsthand the  importance of sun protection, making COOLA's  spray an indispensable asset. In an industry where skincare is very important, COOLA stands out with its dedication to not only protecting against harmful UV rays but also enhancing the overall experience of sun care.

COOLA's sunscreen spray doesn't just shield your skin from UVA and UVB rays; Its broad-spectrum protection ensures comprehensive coverage, safeguarding against both premature aging and potential skin damage. As someone deeply invested in skin health, I love COOLA's commitment to providing a product that protects and cares for my skin.

The scent of Piña Colada fragrance is delicious. Gone are the days of sunscreen smelling like, well, sunscreen. Instead, COOLA's tropical scent transports me to my last vacation. It's a big change from the clinical smell of traditional sunscreens, making the application process a sensory experience.

I did not have any issue in my delicate skin but I always recommend  a patch test.

In my personal opinion, COOLA's in spray isn't just a sun protection product; it's an  evolution of skincare. With its comprehensive protection, anti-aging benefits, and irresistible Piña Colada scent, COOLA has redefined what it means to stay safe in the sun. So, whether I am lounging by the pool or hitting the beach, I make COOLA my go-to companion for summer adventures. And a big pus smells delicious! * The COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a delightful sun protection experience. Its tropical scent evokes visions of sunny beaches and relaxation, enhancing the application process with a touch of indulgence. The organic formula boasts SPF 30, providing reliable protection against both UVA and UVB rays, crucial for preventing sunburn and long-term skin damage. What sets this sunscreen apart is its lightweight texture, which absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. This feature is particularly appealing for those who dislike the heavy feeling often associated with sunscreen application. The spray mechanism ensures effortless and even coverage, making it convenient for reapplication throughout the day, especially during outdoor activities. Furthermore, the use of organic ingredients adds to its appeal for those who prioritize natural  products. 

 In conclusion, the COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a luxurious and effective sun protection solution for those who appreciate both quality and indulgence in their routine. * As a licensed Esthetician, we our taught early on how important using SPF to protect our skin. This aerosol is easy to use and smells amazing! If you have sensitive skin I would recommend spraying into your hands first then applying. I did have a slightly burning feel when I sprayed directly. But, overall I really love how cute and small and effective this spf is to use. My skin adapted the more I used this spf. * I love this sunscreen! Its perfect for travel and smells great. I used it almost all up on my recent vacation. It smells likea tropical holiday on a beach with a coconut. I would definetly recommend. I know the spf is quality and better packaged and easily portable."

You want to spray generously and not skim out on it. The scent is also not too overpowering. * Just no * Beautiful not greasy I buy this over and over try it you won't be disappointed * This gets everywhere oily. You absolutely cannot use it inside or your floors will be slick. I still burn reapplying this too. * Wore this, let it set, and got in pool. 15 minutes later I was blue from the pools paint. This thinned it, removed it, and stuck it to my body while destroying the pools paint. * It was working okay but after 3 weeks of using it almost everday I started to develop rashes. They were circular (kinda likr cigarette burns) reddish, and flaky. They get itchy sometimes. I know it is this product because this is the only new one I've used. Now I don't know what to do with all these rashes and skin damage I've sustained. * Great hand spray type top instead of those one finger kind of press button things. The hand grippy spray allows for easier application in hard to reach areas."

Half way through my 3rd bottle and the sunscreen now has a different consistently and is pilling everytime. It's not expired and was not expecting this especially for the price. Won't be repurchasing and would not recommend. * Tula made a sunscreen serum that was fantastic! Best i ever used. They stopped making it this year so i switched over to this one. Its nothing like the serum! This is heavy, greasy and causes breakouts. It also has a strong smell. Please Bring the serum back! * Got this from FabFitFun! I love this sunscreen - for the brown girlies! This leaves no white cast, smells like bananas, very tropical and leaves your skin with a beautiful glow. * This is my favorite daily spf. I've received a lot of compliments about my skin when I use this product. My only wish for this item is that it would come in a stronger spf. An spf 50 would be ideal! * This is not gel!  This is oily and chunky and awful.  Do NOT buy and waste your money.  First time I've been disappointed by Tula. * This is a good lotion but it's very shiney! * This is such an amazing product! Its so glowy, moisyering amd it has SPF (which is your BFF) i hibetsly think it coulc work fir every skin type. It is worth EVERY CENT."

I received a sample size for my face and used the whole bottle. It was great! Then I bought the body sunscreen for my vacation and after the first use I realized what an expensive mistake it was. It didn't absorb well and left greasy, chunky residue all over my body. It looked like my entire body was peeling from a bad sunburn. This is a very expensive sunscreen for it to not be usable. I don't want to hang out in a public location looking like my skins peeling and I'm shading chunky skin cells all over a public pool. Gross!! * Goes on light.  Not greasy and doesn't leave white residue like some sunscreens do. * I do really like this sunscreen- it's like a clear gel with a velvety finish (think primer consistency). It's rather expensive though for what you get- considering it's a body sunscreen, this wouldn't even get you through a week at the beach. * No matter which supergoop I try they are heavy greasy they do block the sun but feel horrible * Me gusta mucho, no deja la piel grasosa, te da brillo y protege * Absolutely terrible! I broke out in a rash about an hour after using. Theew it away immediately! * I love the OG unseen sunscreen for my face and its the perfect texture and viscosity. I was hoping this would be too. I hate the lotion texture of others so i was really excited that SG came out witb this. The only problem is that its just oily… it absorbs well and makes my skin feel REALLY SOFT but since i do sweat pretty easily it can feel a bit slick at times. Maybe its the olive oil in it? Or its just too many oils."

This was very white but rubbed in and absorbed well. Dries down quick to a soft powdery feel which is so beautiful to the touch.  No smell, did not irritate my eyes, did not make me break out which is amazing bc I'm sensitive and it's just so light feeling on my skin. My skin looks grade and I absolutely love this! * Loveit * I liked this when I would run because  it doesn't run into my eyes when I sweat but it has an awful white cast and I'm very pale. Does not rub in all the way no matter how long you massage it and is pretty greasy. * Pill , white cast and drying * In my personal experience, with this sunscreen i would say that all the pros that they stated above the reviews, are not true at all. They gave me bumps and a rash, that still have not gone away in over a week. I would not recomend this to anyone who has sensitive skin, because I don't have sensitive skin and it gave me an allergic reaction. * If you are remotely melanated, this is NOT the sunscreen for you (unless you don't care about white cast). Even after rubbing this in really well, the white cast doesn't go away. I do feel like this does a great job preventing sunburn, though. * I really wanted to like this product but it made me smell horrible for days somehow despite saying it was unscented and it left a white cast on me that was extremely hard to blend in. After sweating, you could see the white cast build up more and I was constantly having to rub the sunscreen in."

It also works great under makeup and easy to pack size for travel. * I love this lotion from Supergoop! The PLAY Everyday Face Lotion with SPF 50 has become my favorite - it doesn't smell, it doesn't leave that white feeling on the skin and it moisturizes super well! It's perfect under makeup, it's light, doesn't weigh the skin down and doesn't leave it oily. What's more, it's water and sweat resistant, great for everyday use or even for park days here in Florida. Perfect for the whole family! * Gifted by Supergoop for my honest review. I've been using the Supergoop! PLAY Everyday Face Lotion SPF 50 and honestly, I'm impressed. It goes on super smooth, no white cast at all, and feels more like skincare than sunscreen. I love that it's fragrance-free and layers perfectly under makeup—plus my skin feels hydrated all day without getting greasy. * I have used many different supergoop products and received this product complimentary from supergoop but I continually to love everyone I try! This play sunscreen glides on easily and works well for my skin. I have medium skin (not fair but not dark) and it protects my skin from sun exposure and last longer than most sunscreens. * Absolutely obsessed with this! Not only is it a high spf but there's no white cast. This is great on its own for every day coverage but also applied well underneath makeup. Soopergoop never disappoints!

71,la roche-posay,anthelios uv correct spf 70 daily face sunscreen with niacinamide,pimprod2030180,2591831," * I like it for most part... but if you sweat, or rub your eyes, it burns for a really long time. * I purchased this product three times. The first time was great i fell in love instantly, it was greasy, it dried down beautifully and it was great under makeup. Not to mention 70SPF?? Heck ye! So i bought it a second time and i used it for the first few months no problem, and then my eyes started to water..not sting, just water. And i thought hm well thats weird cant be my sunscreen cause ive been using it with no issues, and i was running out so i think purchased my third and final bottle and oh my gods when i tell yall my eyes BURNED. Within the first month of purchasing my third bottle i had to constantly wash my face because i couldnt keep my eyes open. But again, it couldnt have been the sunscreen right?? So for the next weeks i isolated my skincare products and all were perfectly fine…except for this sunscreen. By this time it was too late to return it so in the trash it sadly went. Ive never been so heartbroken, if they changed their formula or if my skin just got allergic to it over time i dont know. Im on the search for a new perfect sunscreen, wish me luck. * I have oily to combination skin and this product is not sweat proof or water proof as stated in the description. I will say this product did correct my darkspots and protected my skin. The lotion does need to be rubbed in and does peel after the second hour but the protection is present. I can only wear inside my house due to it being hot and me being sweaty. * It burned my eyes. I didn't put around eye area. I really wanted to love this spf 70, but it was too hard to work with. left face drier than before I put it on. I had to return it. * I wish I could love this product more; unfortunately, every time I apply this product it would irritate my eyes. Of course, I tried to avoid eye area, but still a few minutes after the application, my eyes would be irritated. If you have sensitive eyes, I would not recommend it. * This sunscreen is sheer and I like it very much. Sadly, it's one that creeps up into my eyes and burns. * This is a hard review to write because in a lot of ways its exactly what I'm looking for: moisturizing, has spf, gentle. The big reason I wouldn't buy it again is it melts into my eyes and stings terribly. Ive actually had to pull off the road barely able to keep my eyes open another second with a waterful of tears (product induced— not weeping) making the whole situation worse. It must not happened to everyone, which is why I gave it for stars. It just doesn't work for me."
72,la roche-posay,anthelios kids gentle sunscreen face and body lotion spf 50,pimprod2037033,2608258," * It looks horrible on my skin. I have used it on different occasions and it always happens the same. Don't waste your money. * By far the best sunscreen out there! I used it daily for a 3 week trip throughout Italy during a heatwave and didn't get burnt despite me being fair as can be and outside the majority of the day. Will always buy again!!! * I purchased this product because the ingredients list showed that it did not include Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene. However, when I received the product, this sunscreen does include these ingredients which are NOT reef safe and is banned from parts of Hawaii. Will be returning. Please update the ingredients to include everything."
73,neutrogena,purescreen+ tinted mineral sunscreen,pimprod2037357,2606100," * Over the summer I wanted a tinted sunscreen to wear in lieu of foundation. I love that this is affordable, comes in a variety of shades (I sometimes mix them) and evens out my skintone while giving me sun protection.  I am in my late 50's, and not into high fashion cosmetics at this point of my life. But i am into quick makeup that looks natural, and this does the trick (although i still use an under eye corrector).  Some people say its oily. I feel like it gives me a dewy glow. Younger people may not like it, but its good for my generation whose makeup can look cakey due to drier skin. You have to shake up the product before applying which can be messy.  I've found that if I take off the lid and put my index finger over the hole while shaking, there's no mess (a finger keeps the product in the bottle better than the lid does). Also, when traveling, I put a small piece of plastic wrap over the hole, then screw on the lid. Pain in the butt?  A bit. But i like the product so I'll deal with the packaging. * I bought this product to make my morning routine easier, but it applies so oily and runny  that I need to be careful when handling the packaging and applying on my face. It's unwearable without setting powder and the product leaks everywhere. I bought a Medium shade but I'm really a light Medium and it shows that it's not the right shade. * Love the shade range and doesn't break me out or dry me out. * I really wanted to like this.  I have fair skin (120 in Fenty) and the light shade worked well for me.  It might be a tiny bit too dark, but it's so sheer that the color blends away and doesn't leave a line.  This has essentially no coverage, even for a tinted moisturizer so don't expect even light coverage with this.  I could deal with that and just use this as a sunscreen if it were not SO OILY.  It remains tacky and shiny even after letting it sink in for half an hour.  I am in my 40s and have very dry skin.  My skin is so dry that I use face oil with my moisturizer at night so I never thought I would say that a product is too oily.  I thought that my summer daytime moisturizer might be too heavy to use with this tinted moisturizer so I tried it without my normal skin care on bare skin the second time I used it.  It's still a greasy mess on my dry as the Sahara skin and the oil never sinks in.  The tint rubs off and leaves a mess if anything touches your face.  I just don't understand the reasoning behind a greasy, tinted sunscreen with no coverage that leaves color on anything that touches your face. * The sunscreen itself I enjoy and is great for my sensitive skin. However, the tube it comes in, is a mess! The sunscreen is so thin, it really needs to come in a pump style not a squeeze style. I feel like I've lost half of the product already because it leaks out the sides. * 1. I only wear mineral spf - if you can do chemical - i wouldn't recommend this. There are so many elegant chemical formulas, especially in k-beauty! 
2. This stuff IS moisturizing and doesn't really dry down. great for dry skin or when set with powder- but i wouldn't recommend to oily girlies. 
3. Its  VERY runny- so make sure to shake it before applying. The packaging gets pretty messy for that reason - i think a dropper bottle would be perfect. 

I use this when my skin needs moisture, like after retinol or AHA. Im pretty pale and the tint is perfect. All universal tinted spfs are too orange for me. 

While i don't this daily, I really do like it and find it's been a staple for my dry or sensitive days. * this oily soup of a sunscreen should not be appearing in the ""CC cream"" or other searches for ulta. to say it's tinted is a farse, it is slightly in appearance to be non-white. it is also the oiliest, runniest cosmetic I have ever encountered. I have dry skin and couldn't even absorb it after many attempts at blending (which then eliminated any coverage it provided). the end feel was disgusting and greasy and it gave acne within 24 hours. also, the packaging doesn't seal well. in just one day it seeped out into my makeup bag. Just awful all around."
74,vacation,classic lotion spf 50 sunscreen,pimprod2037341,2606406," * I've tried using this sunscreen a few times because I like the smell, but I burned three different times with it, and I don't usually burn with sunscreens. I don't recommend this for safe sun care. * This sunblock is awful. It pills so bad whether I rub it in right away or let it soak in for a minute. So naturally it provides no real protection. I genuinely hate this SPF and now I'm stuck with it. * I was excited to try this based on all the good reviews, but it pilled terribly, even as the only product on my skin. It also felt super sticky, and rubbed off on everything I brushed against. It never actually absorbed into my skin. Would not buy again. * LOVE the fragrance. I personally have never had issues with pilling as some others have noted. I have been using this as my go-to for two years now. * I've purchased this product before, a few years ago--no issues with pilling at that time. This time, it pilled horribly on both my husband and myself. We applied a half hour before going to the beach, and then reapplied after spending 40 minutes in the ocean. Both times it never seemed to absorb, just sat on top of the skin and felt greasy and pill-y. It pilled bad enough that I left a residue on the seats of our car. I have red hair and fair skin, so I reapply frequently to prevent sunburn. Guess who got sunburnt with this sunscreen anyway? * I was so excited about this sunscreen but ended up being disappointed! Maybe it's not made for use after being in water, but when reapplying it pilled so badly and I got burnt. It also is extremely greasy. * So I have the smaller size and I have no issues with that one, but I bought the big pump one for my trip and every time I used it it pilled like crazy on my chest back and shoulders. The smaller one doesn't though so I very confused..."
75,bali body,hydrating natural watermelon tanning oil spf15,pimprod2043239,2619272," * So the bottle is the size of a credit card. Ive never seen anything like this, its so hilarious. Why would they make any body product this tiny? Im laughing in disbelief at this bottle. If i used the entire bottle it would maybe cover one of my legs. And im thin. * This product works the way it's intended. Excels your tan, I put this only on my legs when sun bathing and I could feel the product warming up and working. Smell is great. Water resistant didnt come off easily. 
Only downside is its a little pricey for the amount you get, I took a photo of the bottle for reference and I have little baby hands. * Im so annoyed about this purchase, for some reason, no matter how many times I came back, I thought this was more then a tannig oil, I thought it also left a bronze glow. That being said, the bottle is way to small, it also says to use another spf with the product to protect your skin. Its a lovely product but for the amount you receive ans having to use another product with it, its not worth the purchase. Save your money * This product does work abaoultoey wonderul im a very pale person and rbis prsoxut has gave me rhe best tan with no burn but the bottle is really small ive only used it three times and its almost out * I bought this on a whim to try as i was desperate for any sun tanning solution and let me say this has been an unexpected winner! I used it while at a water park hoping to get my backside even and my legs to match my arms. This product has worked better then I could've ever imagined. It smells amazing, a little goes a long way, and it gets you a very nice even tan all throughout your body wherever you use it. I did go ahead and layer the product first having it as my base then a layer of sunblock and then I topped it off with another layer on top. If there was only one thing I could complain about, it would be the amount that you get for the price. While a little does go along way. I just don't know if the price offsets everything else. * The bottle is freaking tiny for 23 dollars. i shouldve looked at the ounces but the bottle just looked bigger in the picture. im not sure how good it is ive only used it once but it smells good * I don't waste my time writing reviews. But girl I need to tell you what just happened. So I am so pale, I know so sad. Okay, so I didn't want a tanning oil to give me a false tan, and ma'am when I tell YOU that I'm proud of this tan because I earned it. The oil smells so nice. I paired it with an spf 50, and I'm new to tanning and you best believe I burn easy. So when I tell you I TANNED. I feel so much better about the way I look. When I say it's only been 15 MINUTES, Jaw on the floor. Picking it up now because it is still devolving and I'm STILL getting darker. Like girl…my pasty self is getting darker? Yes…take my money agin because I'm getting another. I'm bummed I'm only getting like 7-10 uses out of it. But if it works it works. And I am working with this sun right now. Watch me be a bronze goodness by the SUMMER girl. 10/10 oil, you won't find anything better. I promise you that"

I had to wash this off my face and start over bc I couldn't stand how it felt. * I would give these drops 10 out of 5 stars if they fixed the packaging. I love the design but the serum ends up on the thread of the screw top of the bottle when you try to neatly put it away. I dislike losing little bits of the serum to the lid, it's messy. The actual formula & package graphic art is amazing. I also have 40s skin & the formula is forgiving & looks nice on my normal to dry skin. * I love this so much! I hope it never gets discontinued. I have dry skin so I layer this over my moisturizer. Works great alone or or with a full face of makeup. It is such a thin formula it's almost more of a serum, and it takes so little to cover your face and neck. So lightweight and non-greasy you forget you're wearing it. Also smells amazing and the packaging is really cute and nostalgic. * I wanted to love it but when I apply my face stings and then I get dry itchy blotches on my face after…so I mean if you don't have the sensitivity it can be a great spring/summer or even daily spf staple but not for me unfortunately * easy to apply, even buildable bronze, glowy, smells nice"

On busy days I use this on top of a face setum & moisturizer, then add face powder & Im out the door.  Also takes liquid foundation well.  Im actually here looking to buy my 2nd tube.  I have rosacea that causes acne & this product was not irritating to my face.  Big win! * Now that summer is here, I don't go anywhere without it! I used to sparingly in the winter but now that we are in full sun days its a must! Its not to thick or greasy. Its blends into my skin beautifully and my makeup last all day! It does a great job of hiding and protecting my dark spots to make sure they dont get worse or more gets added to my face. Keep this product around forever please! The 50 is my jam! Sensitive skin commemter here! :) * Tried it in store per the clinique associate and I really like it! It is on the thicker side but it spreads nicely and doesnt pill when paired with clinique moisture surge 100H or peach and lily's matcha moisturizer (my two HG moisturizers). You need your moisturizer to dry for 15 minutes and THEN apply your spf, this dramatically reduces it from pilling. It does look very orange when dispensed but it gives me a great sheer tint that looks like I put makeup on, its beautiful! So I wear alone typically on non-makeup days but does work very well as a primer as well (I use IT cosmetics CC+ foundation in light warm medium. For reference, I am also WN04 Bone in Clinique even better makeup so light/med and the tint works great for me. Wish it came in a bigger bottle! As it is pricy when you apply the standard 1/4tsp. * Im sooooo impressed with this product! I only need a little and i blend a small amount of foundtaion for a sunkissed look. I will not be running out of this all year round! Woohoo * Can't get over the tacky texture - not expected at this price point.  I'll be going back to the Shiseido sunscreen - still haven't found anything better.  Really disappointed. * I'm pretty fair and wore this every day in Aruba for a week without having to reapply throughout the day. Great sun protection and light weight. My new go to product in the summer * Also the closer you get to the bottom of the tube it begins to pill"

80,drunk elephant,umbra mineral cream spf 30 tinted face sunscreen,pimprod2045266,2622999," * I wanted to love this.  It does have a weird grit when you first put it on, but that really wasn't the deal-breaker.  This stuff makes my face feel sticky/greasy.  It's also really hard to get off my hands after I've applied it to my face. * All ingredients are good. Moisturizing, feels great knowing and trusting the ingredients won't give me a rash. If it is chilly in morning I do rub between my warm fingers and lather across my face. When I reapply after 2 hours, it glides on over without being oily, grainy or cakey. The 3rd reapplication is good and not thick. But have to wash face before the 4th reapplication. I highly recommend for those with sensitive skin or a true Mineral Sunscreen. No fragrance which I love. * This is the best sunscreen i have used in the last several years. Everything breaks me out & burns my eyes. This hasnt done with of those things. Goes on smooth and can be worn like a BB cream. * One of the worst products ever. Cannot get passed the texture, it feels like rubbing sand on your face and is so grainy and patchy. I returned it right after trying it. * This feels like a moisturizer on my skin. I don't mind putting it on like others that feel thick or like foundation. It's refreshing, smooth easy to blend.  I've been using it since the new tint came out.  I don't want to use my more expensive one anymore. * I got this in the color tinted and wore it while on spring break in Disney but it is very gritty. I had to use a makeup brush to blot it on bc it felt like rubbing sand on my face. * I'm very, very fair skinned. This leaves a white cast on me, which has never happened in my life. The texture is weirdly gritty, and it's quite oily after dry down and not in a cute way. It settles into my laugh lines throughout the day and I have to keep rubbing it in. Can't get out any that gets on my eyebrows so I have brow flakes all day. I use a ton of different face sunscreens and especially for the price, this is awful sunscreen."

Its not. Although I do love rhe texture and it does leave no white cast and is hydrating, it emphasized redness on my cheeks and thats where im more sensitive. I did see notice little breakouts since I started using this sunscreen.  Will be returning. * I wanted to like this due the price and reviews were good. For me, it just sits on top of my skin. All day. Long. Very greasy and gives my face an unwelcomed sheen. * I loved Ulta and have been a huge fan. Unfortunately with this order I've taken a step back. I paid over double the price I should have paid. I didn't get the discount bc they were out of stock and never said anything except it was canceled. * I did order 2 and one the caps were missing but idk💀 * this is the best dailu moisturizer OR just a regular SPF, its lightweight & all! * this is the best dailu moisturizer OR just a regular SPF, its lightweight & all!"
82,vacation,classic spray spf 30 sunscreen,pimprod2032500,2595586," * It smells good but I now have a giant pimple-y rash across my back and chest where I reapplied this sunscreen. Pretty bummed since this is one of the few reef safe sprays they sell in stores at Ulta. * I used this product as directed and religiously while out. I now look like a tomato and have sun poisoning. Don't waste your money * I used this sunscreen recently at an amusement park and it was 90s the whole time. Good news is that I didn't get burnt but I felt sticky the whole day. It was pretty uncomfortable. I would buy again if there was a dry touch option. * Unfortuately this product pilled a lot and was not sweat resitant for me. Dissappinted :( * perfect sunscreen for wandering the city, hiking, just sitting outside, not greasy which is so major, smells unique in a good way * I was excited to try this based on all the rave reviews. I guess the smell was ok. After getting out of the water, I found the product turned into a white film. Also pilled with reapplication. Can't say if it was effective against burning because I switched to another brand mid afternoon due to the pilling. * Vacation products are ALL great. I have them all! The sprayer works great, the smell is amazing, I've seen mixed reviews complaining of the ""strong smell""..that is the whole point, the ""Vacation"" smell, if you want non scented buy non-scented!"
83,supergoop!,daily spf starter set for face and body,pimprod2044980,2624465," * It gave me a really bad white cast and I was left looking like Casper the Ghost. Also, it broke me out and blurred my vision a bit. After a couple of minutes, I noticed that my skin was turning red. It was so bad that I had to wash it off. * Used 2 for gifts for my daughters teachers and kept the 3rd for myself. It feels so weightless on my face, no grease and great coverage. A recurring buy for me"
84,vacation,super stick spf 45 face stick sunscreen,pimprod2044959,2623030," * This sunscreen doesn't leave a white cast, had an easy application, and didn't leave my skin greasy. * I really love this sunscreen stick! I found it looks really nice alone or under makeup. I really have been loving the finish it leaves on my skin, and the sp45 and smell are really nice bonuses! * I love the shape of the sunscreen stick. It's pointed on one end so it's easy to get under the eye area and on the nose. However, I find this formula very dry and difficult to apply. I have to press very hard in order to get the product on my face simply because it is not emollient enough. Luckily the formula doesn't disturb my makeup underneath. It works but I will probably not purchase this again. * I don't hbderstand all the good reviews. Maybe I got a bad batch. It did not glide on easily, you have to apply pressure so if you're wearing makeup it will get messd up. It also leaves my face feeling sticky to the point that my hair sticks to my face. It feels like I put a gluestick or Chapstick on my face. * I like the easy application, and the light scent. * For future buyers the stick is actually mostly full of product. The 1/2 inch mark is simply the divet in the product that is there for shape presentation, the rest of the bar is sunscreen that is usable. FYI! The reviews mistake this for the full bar but it is dense enough and contains enough product to last long, about 3 inches long. * Although the stick is small, the consistency is firm enough and solid so that you can get a lot of use out of it. Just make sure it doesnt get in your eyes."
85,coola,classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 30 tropical coconut,pimprod2030786,2592674," * The is one of three sun related products that I started to use last year.  Jess; one of our managers told me about the results.  Its great for the environment and I did not burn. Last year is the first time that I did not burn in all my years going to the New Jersey beach.  I love it so much; I purchase it for the people I love. * To fair skin individuals… this did not protect me from getting burned. Was out in sun for 90 minutes (not in water), reapplied and still burned. * This tropical coola sunscreen is to die for! The smell reminds me of a beach tropical resort with coconuts and pina coladas. The spray settles perfectly on my skin and doesn't leave a cast or residue like most sunscreens I use do. I highly recommend trying this sunscreen. The fact that it's clear is amazing to me, I can only use clear. The smell is so tropical and beachy. I can't wait to wear this sunscreen all summer long. I used this on my son as well and he is 5, and it worked very well. This Coola sunscreen is going to be my go to this summer. If you haven't tried this sunscreen yet, run & add it to your cart! I'll be purchasing another once this one runs out and probably even get on for my mom. This tropical coconut sunscreen is my new favorite product! Product was received as part of an educational promotion. * Coola clear sunscreen is awesome I live the smell and also love how it doesn't make your skin feel greasy or leaving you with a white hue! The packaging is gorgeous and I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone! Everything about this product is awesome. * I absolutely loved the COOLA Tropical Coconut Clean Sunscreen Spray SPF 30! The scent is a dreamy, beachy coconut that instantly transports you to paradise. The formula is incredibly moisturizing, leaving my skin feeling soft and hydrated without any greasy residue. It sprays on evenly, absorbs quickly, and provides great sun protection with its SPF 30. I also appreciate that it's made with clean ingredients, making it a great choice for everyday use. Whether at the beach or running errands, this sunscreen keeps my skin glowing and protected. I  will definitely be using this all the time here in sunny miami. I'm so happy I discovered this great spf to add to my skin care regimen. This product was gifted as  part of  an educational promotion. * The COOLA 30 Clear Sunscreen Spray in Tropical Coconut is a summer must-have! It feels super lightweight, absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave a greasy finish. The tropical coconut scent is subtle and refreshing.

Its comparable to more expensive brands for way less! * I purchased because i had heard great things about this but it is not for me.. leaves a horrible purple like cast on my face and have to rub pretty hard to lather it around * Overall, a good product. My only issues were that it seens to rub off easily, it's hard to wash off  with just soap, and it has a white cast. * I don't know how well it protected me from the sun but I do not like this sunscreen. Has huge white cast, oily and my face felt stifled after applying this product. I have mixed skin and fair skin tone, but this product just made me look unnaturally white. * I don't like the smell at all id prefer banana boat supergoop , coola , vacation brand , for sure.!! Or laroche posay my other fav!! All the other brands i mentioned are good!! * If you are looking for clean sunscreen look no further * Bought this for our mexico vacation, the white cast was horrendous, and it definitely doesnt hold on in the water. I reapplied it on my husband idk how many times and he still burned. Mind you he is naturally golden tan, but this was bad. Really really wanted to like it, but i just cant."

Good product just not for me. * The Ulta Unseen Sunscreen SPF 50 which I received complimentary from Supergoop feels like a primer yet has the protection of a sunscreen.  I love it because it is beneficial for my skin as it diminishes pores and allows for smoother makeup application.   The formula is unique and stands out because of its performance.   I highly recommend especially for traveling and busy days. * This is my all time favorite sunscreen. It is so great for everyday and using underneath makeup. It doesnt pill or change the texture of my makeup. Its weightless and it doesnt leave a white cast. Obsessed! Gifted by supergoop * It's good, just not worth money or intrigues me anymore. Burns eyes, makes skin slightly irritated. Wouldn't buy because there's better for sale out there. * I really like this sunscreen. I buy this size, because I think it is too expensive. * i've struggled with finding a face sunscreen for decades. i'll never look elsewhere. feels so good when it goes on (smooth!) and disappears instantly. isn't shiny, isn't matte, doesn't have any sort of cast. no weird smell. makes a great base for makeup and washes off easily."

I use this after i let my moisturizer since in for like 5-10 mins. It glides right on and doesnt pill. I love this under makeup because i feel like it gives me such a healthy glow underneath that makes my makeup look even better. I love this when im not wearing makeup as well because it just gives such a great glow. Id you are having any issues with pilling it could just be reacting to other products you have. This is the ONLY product ive never had an issue with * I saw this and thought it would be wonder and easy to use and wear my suncreen plus give other benefits. I used this once, applied in the morning under makeup. The next day my face was red, swollen and breaking out everywhere. I have never seen so many breakouts on my face like this before and I don't have acne prone skin. My skin can be sensitive but wow this reaction is crazy. * A little goes a long way! I use this 5-10 minutes before my primer every day (i switch between Huda and Caliray) and I love this serum. No pilling. It feels amazing, not greasy at all. * I tried and tried to apply this product and it pilled on my skin so bad every time. Rather it was used alone or with another product it always pilled. ): * Absolutely love this product... goes on smoothly not greasy at all . I wear this everyday and I work outside * I use hyaluronic serum on damp face before putting this sunscreen on. After about 10 minutes i apple yhe elf putty primer matte with a sponge-quite liberally i might add. It looks so nice that i barely need founfation, just a sheer amount and under eye concealer. Fit Me concealer works really well patted on with this routine. My Dior forever-not so much. * I use hyaluronic serum on damp face before putting this sunscreen on.

No further * No other sunscreen spray (with zinc) compares to this one. The mist is very fine and non-greasy. On my second bottle and will continue to purchase. * Not only was it effective, I didn't get that sticky,  gnarly feel on my skin, nor did it make my skin break out. Really great stuff. I would definitely recommend it to friends and will certainly be purchasing this product again. I was extremely pleased with it. * I really wanted to like this more. I love spray sunscreens but this was a waste of money. The nozzle stopped working after just a few uses. * I don't usually leave reviews, but I was super disappointed in this one.  The nozzle stopped working almost immediately, I didn't even get one leg fully covered before it clogged up.  Luckily I had a backup lotion with me. Other Blue Lizard products have been great. * I would say this product is a firm no for me as I PERSONALLY experienced a minor allergic reaction on my arms and it made them really itchy with small bumps. I had high hopes it would work fantastically as it's mineral with high spf but it's unfortunately a no for me :("
90,kinship,self reflect probiotic moisturizing sunscreen spf 32,pimprod2017785,2569946," * I was looking forward to trying this product because I always prefer mineral sunscreens, but I didn't even open it and test it because I noticed immediately that the product had expired in March 2025 and I received it today on June 27, 2025. That is unacceptable. So I will be making a trip to the store to return it, along with another product that arrived in my order from Ulta that was an eye cream which had completely dried out. What is going on Ulta? * I am allergic to chemical sunscreen, so I have to buy mineral only. This one is lightweight feeling on the skin, leaves my skin feeling soft and not sticky throughout the day, and it doesn't smell of traditional sunscreen. It does leave somewhat of a white cast but once I put on some blush and bronzer I don't see a difference. This sunscreen is definitely one I recommend to my friends and family. * This sunscreen leaves the healthiest glow on my skin and does not cause breakouts. I'm on my third tube and just bought anothrr. I love the Kinship vitamin c eye cream and serum as well. * I should have stuck with my tried and true Kinship Mineral Sunscreen! It is now my holy grail after 3 years of use. It glides on nice and reapplication is easy, after the 3rd application it does get oily on me.I wash my face before a 4th application. I highly recommend for sensitive skin and those looking for great ingredients that do not irritate. I have mature skin and only when my skins need more hydration I will put this sunblock over my moisturizer and they both work well with each other. No complaints. I tell everyone who needs a good sunscreen to try Kinship Mineral sunscreen. Please do not change ingredients! * I have been using this sunscreen for years and really like it for my face. I just purchased this in store with my Ulta points and realized after I purchased that it expired in September 2024. I went back into the store and they only had 2 others and both were expired.  The cashier said she could order me another online which I had to pay full price for and then bring back into the store and exchange it.  Not to my surprise the one I was sent in the mail is also expired.  Very disappointing. Ulta should damage out expired products. * It's on the thicker side, so very moisturizing. It has a pleasant smell and leaves the face looking quite dewy. No white cast. * I love the dewy look this sunscreen creates on my face, and it wasn't bad to apply this on my face although I felt like I had to rub a bit more than I usually do with my Kbeauty sunscreens to get it to blend. BUT the vanilla smell is just too strong. At first, I thought the smell was pleasant, but then I started smelling this on my skin throughout the day, hours after application, and I was self-conscious about smelling like a cookie. I tried finishing this product in an effort not to be wasteful (because of my skincare consumerist habits), but I just couldn't."

This product didn't work for my face at all. Its greasy, heavy, and it clogs my pores. When I sweat it does burn my eyes. This product makes my face so greasy I can fry food with it. Even after washing with an exfolianting cleanser, my exfoliating toner still shows traces of residue from this product. 

I havent used it in over a week and my breakouts are clearing out. 

This product does work very well for the body! I especially use it on my tattoos. It's effectiveness still debatable for the body since I try to cober my tattoos majority of the summer. * It works fine on my skin but if you get it anywhere near close to your eyes prepare for your eyes to be burning and watering for the next 3 hours. I can also taste it in the back of my mouth which i dont think is normal. * Burned my face and made me break out. It caused my skin to flake off and my makeup look cakey... yes i let it set in. Made my skin look and feel oily. Would not recommend. * It's not greasy, doesn't break me out, and sits well on top of vaseline or jojoba oil that I use for my face. Personally my eyes are fine but some reviews say it stings for them. * This is a good sunscreen if you have really oily skin. It absorbs quickly and is quite drying. It has silica in it which makes sense. I have combo skin so this leaves my skin dry which is why it is not for me. However I saw a lot of comments about pilling, this sunscreen has silicone in it to keep it oil free. Be careful when using this to not mix it with water based products that is why it pills. Or let it sink into the skin completely before applying other products. * This sunscreen seemed like a great option, but it pills really bad. I just put it over my moisturizer that I use every day and it had made my foundation come off in little balls. * This doesnt leave any cast on my skin OR pill off when i apply it! I purchased because the one from La Roche Posay pills up on my skin and can be a little tricky under makeup but this is a cheaper and better alternative in my opinion"
93,avÃ¨ne,mineral tinted compact spf 50,pimprod2020808,2577170," * This product exceeded my expectation. It makes my morning super easy with a two in one with SPF and foundation in one. Gorgeous tone and full coverage! Huge plus thag it doesnt clog pores. * I love this compact powder for its sun protection factor, it has very good coverage, it is creamy, for my complexion it is perfect * If your skin is oily, and you love having a base every day, this is for YOU! Love the shade (I am a light tone in foundation) and this fits perfect. For both seasons.. Easy to retouch, with a mirror to carry wherever. * If you're not wearing a full face of makeup, this is a great way to reapply SPF during the day on the go without having to get product all over your hands or needing to touch your face. Initially I thought the beige looked way too dark (I'm a light warm-neutral) but once you spread it on your skin it lightens up considerably and looks like a tinted moisturizer with light coverage. If I squint hard enough there is a very faint white cast, but it's barely noticeable. All in all if either shade works for you it's a great hands-free light coverage daytime SPF reapplication tool that will stay in my purse! * I do like the quality of the compact and the creamy texture made it easy apply.  I also was very pleased that it has SPF.  However, the color is a bit darker than I thought it would be.  I would only purchase again if it was available in a lighter color. * This is thick and immediately settles into any lines and wrinkles you might have. The lighter shade has a bit of an orange hue on my fair/light skin. It looks just awful. It might have good sun protection, but I wouldn't want to wear this around other humans who can see my face. * i love avene and have gotten their liquid tinted moisturizer in europe which i love but this is a miss for me. it highlights every bit of texture and dry skin i have. there are way better powder foundations with spf. i wosh this was just liquid"
94,coola,dew good illuminating serum sunscreen with probiotic technology spf 30,pimprod2030633,2591991," * Thank goodness for the negative reviews that came before mine - I am relieved to have ID'd the ingredient I reacted so horribly to! I bought and used this product in the summer without any issue. Gives a beautiful finish (though I did experience some white caste but only along my jawline/neck for some reason). Loved it and wore it daily in the summer months but used another sunscreen come fall. I decided to give it a whirl about five months after I purchased it and was greeted with a terrible reaction - swollen bright red face + burning and itching sensations lasting several days. I tried it again a couple months later to confirm it was the culprit and that it did. It's definitely the bismuth oxychloride and something obviously happened over time to make it more aggravating to those with sensitive skin. Major bummer because it looks great! But definitely causes an awful reaction to those with sensitivity issues. * I love the consistency of this product. I wanted to love this. But it gave me cystic acne :( * I love this sunscreen, it is everything the elf halo glow wanted to be. This is the only product i have used that clears my acne without being a true acne targeting product. It has the most beautiful radiance, and is very lightweight. Once the product is starting to run low, though, the pump becomes hard to use. Other than that is perfect. * I loved this product so much I repurchased another bottle. It gave my skin a soft dewy glow. The formula must have changed between purchases because I developed an incredible itch on my face and neck which included a bumpy rash. I eliminated all current products I was using and added back in slowly and much to my chagrin this was the culprit. If you have sensitive skin, beware. If you don't,  go for it! I am still disappointed I cant use it anymore. * I absolutely adore this sunscreen! I dont like to wear foundation, so this gives me the perfect dewy base without feeling trapped or heavy. * I could NOT recommend this sunscreen more. I've repurchased several times now, and I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear it. It's lightweight but moisturizing, the perfect glowy base for makeup (but also beautiful on its own!), smells luxe and divine, and has the perfect amount of SPF for everyday use. But while the product itself is incredible, I think the packaging needs work. I love the glass for sustainability reasons, but once the product starts to run low, it's incredibly hard to get the pump to work. I can visibly see that there's plenty more product in the container, but the pump won't retrieve it. Once I get to the end I have to unscrew the pump and use a tiny spatula to get the last of it out. This sunscreen is pricey, so I'm definitely trying to get my money's worth here, and the packaging makes it difficult to do so. It's not enough to stop me from buying it because I love this product so much (and I am PICKY about sunscreen), but I do hope COOLA sees this and makes a change soon. * I got a sample of this product from Ulta and had a horrible reaction to it. I got hives, my face was so swollen and red, and I was itchy. Definitely do a swab test if youre going to use this product, and give it time to react (I didn't react until about 8 hours after putting it on)."

Matthew is very knowledgeable and helps me with products suitable for my skin tone. * Overall, I'm pleased with this sunscreen. I use it for my body when out running errands. 

There is no white cast - it blends very well. However, it does smell/feel like sunscreen. After a while, the scent fades. 

I tried applying to my face, but it was too thick, and it caused my skin to break out. I recommend using something else for your face. * It's a struggle to get everybody to wear sunscreen sometimes. This one is great because it has a light, fresh scent that isn't cloying or ""tropical"". It's not sticky or heavy feeling. The large pump bottle is a great size and shape  to tote along. Love that refill packs are available too. * I love this sunscreen a lot. It works very well, its not overly sticky or oily, it smells like rosemary and lemon which is very pleasant. Its reef friendly and vegan which I would say are my two most important things to look for in a sunscreen. I do have one problem with this one and that one of the main reasons I picked this one over another brand was the refill. So it took me a few months to get through the first one and I bought my refill and its a plastic pouch with a plastic cap, which I find extremely disappointing. If this brand was actually concerned about enviromental friendliness, they would either have refill stations inside of a store like Ulta or sell a compostable refill pouch. * I bought this looking for a glowy sunscreen that didn't make my skin oily but still hydrated my skin (I have dry skin) and this did the opposite. Whenever i wear it it makes my skin drier than it was before in a few hours and makes my skin really greasy and oily. Plus the price is really high for the mini tbat I bought. I don't recomend this and i will not be repurchasing. The only pro is that there is no whitecast. * Finally a 50 spf sunscreen that doesn't leave a white residue. * Easy to use, you don't need much, not greasy, smooth and no sun gets through!!  Love it!"
96,supergoop!,play everyday lotion spf 50 with sunflower extract pa++++,pimprod2029934,2589381," * So far I have enjoyed using this product and have no complaints......my beauty consultant, Matthew,  introduced me to this product and I'm delighted that he did......whenever I go into the store looking for assistance with a product and make a purchase, 
Matthew is very knowledgeable and helps me with products suitable for my skin tone. * Overall, I'm pleased with this sunscreen. I use it for my body when out running errands. 

There is no white cast - it blends very well. However, it does smell/feel like sunscreen. After a while, the scent fades. 

I tried applying to my face, but it was too thick, and it caused my skin to break out. I recommend using something else for your face. * It's a struggle to get everybody to wear sunscreen sometimes.

97,kopari beauty,travel size sun shield body glow gel spf 50,pimprod2042965,2619700," * This product looks so beautiful in the package, but was a HUGE disappointment when I used it! The thick consistency requires a large amount of product to properly cover your skin; then, it never dries down or soaks in, leaving an oily, sticky mess on the skin, which then proceeds to get on everything. I was so frustrated with the residue this left on my seat/bathing suit/phone screen, etc. To top it all off, I got sunburned! After being fried to a crisp, I saw where the directions say to apply 2 layers (you've got to be kidding me- ain't nobody got time for that, PLUS the first layer never dries anyways!), and to re-apply every *40 minutes* if in water. The typical time is 80 minutes. I'm giving 1 star for the only positive thing about it, the packaging.  Super nice pump & perfect size to throw in your bag for travel. Otherwise, this product has completely missed the mark. * Used this product on a 70 degree beautiful day and now i have badly burned arms. Be cautious with this product or only use it on your legs. * My friend and I went to the beach and we reapplied the shnscreen all day but we both ended up getting badly sunburned, which defeats the purpose of a sunscreen. I will say the oil feels great and makes your skin feel very soft especially when you walk into the water but it defintely needs higher SPF. * At first I really liked the smell, reminded me of the beach but now it literally gives me a headache.  Definitely not a gel, more of an oil and it doesn't absorb well, at least not for me.  I understand it's a gel spf oil, so probably the wrong product if you are looking for a moisturizing gel oil. * I was really shocked that there seemed to be zero glow or shimmer. My regular body lotions provide 10x the glow this does. I alsk wouldnt recommend it as an all over body spf as its not that easy to spread and blend. It stays oily on your skin and doesnt absorb. I do like the smell of this though. * I really liked how nice and silky the texture is, but unfortunately it gave me rash on my legs and arms. I was hoping this product was not the reason why i got the rash. I stopped using it for 3 months. Recently i used it agian was very excited but unfortunately after 24 hours the rash came back. * Love this stuff. It's so shiny and shimmery and smells amazing."
98,coola,travel size classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 50,pimprod2012273,2561106," * I have easy to burn skin, so I'm always on the hunt for a good sunscreen.  This Coola one is the best so far.  I even forgot to reapply and still didn't burn.  I love that it goes on completely clear and it doesn't feel greasy.  I just wish it was a little more affordable, but it's still worth the money. * The product itself is amazing. Used it 3 times and it is almost empty, for the price it fell like a total rip off * This sunscreen smells totally not. Like .sunscreen. Just smells really fresh and delicious and all while keeping you safe in the sun ! Wow. A tad pricey so I keep it for myself ! * After suffering stinky chemical smelling SPF sprays, I finally tried this brand. Twice the price but so worth it. Smells like heavenly Guava Mango and that's it. It outlasts the 80 minute rec time, is moisturizing and allows for tan with no burn. * Fragrance free. Not sticky or greasy. My skin felt like I hadn't applied sunscreen. My new go to sunscreen spray. * I've tried quite a few sunscreens, and the COOLA Suncare Classic Sunscreen Spray Fragrance-Free Broad Spectrum SPF 50 is definitely one of my favorites! I love that it provides broad-spectrum protection with SPF 50, which gives me peace of mind knowing I'm well-protected during outdoor activities.

What really stands out to me is how lightweight and non-greasy it feels on my skin. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a sticky residue like other sunscreens I've tried. Plus, the fragrance-free formula is perfect for anyone who is sensitive to strong scents or just doesn't want to smell like sunscreen all day. I can apply it generously without worrying about any overpowering fragrance.

The spray nozzle also makes it super easy to apply, especially when I'm on the go or need to reapply throughout the day. I've used it on both my face and body, and it's been gentle, with no irritation or breakouts. It's also water-resistant, which is a must for me when I'm spending time at the pool or beach.

Overall, I highly recommend this sunscreen for anyone looking for reliable sun protection that's easy to use, gentle on the skin, and fragrance-free. It's definitely a staple in my summer skincare routine! * This was the worst sunscreen I ever used. I brought it to Hawaii because it is reef safe and applied it to my husband and I. He complained about the alcohol smell. We applied/reapplied as directed and both got bad sunburns- his even blistered!"
99,shiseido,clear sunscreen stick spf 50+,pimprod2022854,2576053," * We love this sunscreen. And as a family that has young kids and parents with a history of skin cancers, this is what we use. Non greasy and breathable. I stock up every spring and throughout the summer. * It glides on over makeup without moving it. I had my partner and sister try it over thier makeup and it didnt disturb it. My gfs makeup is dewy and my sisters is matte. Worked for them both. I love it aswell bc it doesnt break me out. This is my second one * Ive bought two of this product now, and love it. Its lightweight, doesn't burn your eyes, and doesn't clog pores. Lasts a long time too! * I really wish my skin liked this because I loved the glow that it gave my skin after I applied my makeup. but at the end of each day I would find a new bump on my face. I put this on after serum and before moisturizer. Will be returning unfortunately. 😭 * I have turned my family onto this product.  It's light weight and easy to apply and reapply.  Small stick but lasts a long time.  Excellent sun protection. * This is the best face sunscreen ever. I habe repurchased this over and over. The price is high but it lasts forever if its ever one sale BUY it. Ive tried so many and this is the best one for under makeup * Not very greasy. slides on easy. Be sure to get everywhere. I was in a hurry and didn't swipe my entire forehead 😆😆 and it showed."
100,coola,peach blossom classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 70,pimprod2012875,2561100," * I have used Coola in the past and wanted a 70spf. I broke out severly on my chest and arms - the only areas I applied the spray. I can't imagine anyone using this on their face. The smell is super strong and smells like chemicals. Test on a patch of skin and wait a day before using it. The next day my skin was burning and itchy and the breakout lasted a week. I have used the Coola 50spf unscented lotion without incident. So perhaps its the fragrance? Regardless use with caution. * I tried the Suncare Classic Sunscreen Spray Peach Blossom SPF 70 and was pleasantly surprised by its soft, fruity scent. The spray formula makes application easy, though it leaves a slightly sticky feeling on the skin. It provides solid protection, especially for short periods in the sun.  This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review. * I find this spray to be greasier than other spf 70 sprays I have used. The smell is definitely not ""peachy"". It has a very chemical smell to it. 

Certainly not worth the price! * Im not really a peach scent wearer but this smells perfect when i layer it with anything I wear. Also i usually hate wearinf oily stuff bc i have sensory issues but its not oily and dries fast. * Provides excellent protection. It has a light, clean, fresh, and fruity fragrance. It is lightweight and organic. * COOLA is one of my favorite brands so when I saw they had a 70 SPF I haf to try it. And it is now a constant staple i have. The smell is also nice not too fragramt  and not the typical sunscreen amell * I used this on just myself maybe 4 times and it was gone. For how expensive this is you do NOT get enough product."
101,cerave,hydrating sheer sunscreen face and body lotion with spf 30,pimprod2036753,2606576," * I have used this sunscreen about halfway through now and it does what a sunscreen is supposed to do. I feel like it has the same effect as maybe sunscreen lotion you'd take to the beach. I wouldnt buy it again simply because if im putting it in a rush, it wont blend in fast enough. * I was tired of spending so much on daily SPF for my face that came in such small tubes, so I hesitantly gave this a try. Its awesome. Im 22M with bad acne, eczema and sensitive combo skin, so good spf that doesnt burn or break me out is hard to find. This hits all my marks. Lightweight, glowy, no stinging or burning, doesnt clog pores and it has GREAT price per ounce value compared to other SPF. 10/10 forever recommend. * I wasn't impressed with this sunscreen. It was difficult to run in and in areas of my face where I was trying to be gentle and not rub too much, it ended up looking streaky. It also didn't feel very hydrating l. I often had to mix it with water or my CeraVe moisturizer just to get it to mix in well. * This sunscreen works for me and I love it. It comes out thick but applies smooth and thin. It leaves the skin hydrated and can be used under makeup. * Lightweight but powerful moisturizing power! 

Minimal white cast, may take just a few extra seconds to fully blend in.

Works for most skin types, which can be helpful on group & family trips * First off, the only sunscreens I use are Korean sunscreens because they are so lightweight and do not leave a white cast and they do not irritate my eyes st all. 
I got a sample of this sunscreen from the doctors office and decided to try it out. I was absolutely blown away by it.  It did not irritate my eyes at all. It didn't have a strong SPF scent to it. It wasn't greasy, it doesn't leave a white cast and it did not ball up under my makeup.  The only negative thing I can say about it, is that it only has an SPF of 30.  
But I would absolutely recommend this. * This sunscreen is definitely my favorite! Its affordable, works great for both face and body as the product claims, and moisturizes well. All these benefits together make it ideal to bring along for travel, instead of bringing seperate sunscreens for face and body and a seperate moisturizer"
102,dime,tinted glow wonderscreen spf 30,pimprod2043028,2621467," * Gave me skin rash. Looking at ingredients shows Butyloctyl Salicylate a chemical UV filter is not mineral. 0 stars for not being honest about their sunscreen! I do not recommend. * This product had a nice texture to it. Very creamy. On the oily side. The tint part was not really good for me. * I bought this because I needed a new sunscreen and it was good for a day then it started sort of peeling or becoming very noticeable. I started applying it differently and that helped but some spots are still very noticeable. * I have light/medium skin tone and ordered Tint 2. It blends beautifully with my skin and doesn't feel heavy, tacky or drying. Finding a face spf has been tricky for me because chemical sunscreens burn when i apply them and mineral sunscreens seem to suck all of the moisture out of my skin leaving it so dry. This one is perfect leaving a nice glow without looking greasy, irritating my skin or drying it out. * I love how lightweight this product is! Doesnt clog my pores and offers a light coverage. Great for my skin, which is fairly even with a little texture and some discoloration. Product is a little liquidy, if you use too much is gives a ghostly hue. Use less than 1 full pump and looks great and natural! * The product looks amazing on the skin and it's the right consistency and texture.  Love the glow.  The bottle is even beautiful.  But for some reason, it feels like it goes empty fast because of the pump and the container.  It's hard to get out the remaining product.  I love that it's glass because it's better than plastic, but I wonder how we can maximize the product, since it's so little in the bottle already.  Thank you, DIME, for making beautiful, clean skincare and fragrances.  PLEASE don't sell out!  Thank you!! * I've purchased this product multiple times before it was available from Ulta. It provides the perfect amount of color and blends well. I solely wear it and blush on a daily basis. The only complaint I have is the bottle and pump. Once you've used a little over half of the bottle, the pump stops working. The bottle is also glass so it's hard to get the remaining product out. It doesn't stop me from repurchasing though."
103,good molecules,sheer mineral sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2037436,2606130," * This blends onto the skin very well and I didnt have any whitecast. I think it works best when you stick to rest of Good Molecules Daily Essentials box plus the cleanser and use this last. Occasionally I felt a little tingling sensation on my skin after applying but haven't had a reaction or stinging eyes like with chemical sunscreens. My skin tends to be oily and this sunscreen didn't make it shinier than usual so that made me happy. I feel bad others didnt have a good experience with it but it's well loved in my routine. * I have oily skin and my skin gets irritated really fast I don't have this problem with this product * Okay facial sunscreen for the price, it hasnt pilled for me and seemed to blend fine with my skincare but it feels heavy on my skin and it DOES leave a white cast. I'll finish the full tube but I wont be re-purchasing. * I recieved this in my Freebies Bag with my order and was excited to try it.... this excitement quickly died. I rubbed it in fully (slight white cast but I worked it in and it went away) but even after laying out to tan so it would fully soak into my skin, got in the pool and when getting back out, hello Casper the friendly ghost. Streaks of white all over me. Truly can say I've never had anything like that before. I'll finish out what I have cause I hate to waste but absolutely will not be purchasing and wouldn't recommend anyone purchase it. * Not a true Mineral Sunscreen! Good molecules why would you put Chemical Butyloctyl Salicylate or any Salicylates into Sunscreen especially a ""Mineral sunscreen""? This gave me a rash. I do not recommend. And it is not Mineral sunscreen, transparency should be practiced when advertising Mineral when ingredients say otherwise. Don't trust your products anymore. * Live this sunscreen doesnt make me feel greasy at all & leaves no ehote cast, the only thing is i wish it csme in a higher coverage like 50. * I got this as a gift to try out, and personally, I didn't enjoy the product. As someone with a medium skin tone, this suncreen left a pretty noticeable white cast. I also have very dry, eczema prone skin and this left my skin flaky and dry, and kind of itchy afterwards. Overall, just not for me, but it might work if you have a different skin type."
104,supergoop!,glow oil spf 50 dry body oil sunscreen,pimprod2042888,2617634," * This does not feel oily or greasy. It leave a nice refreshing feel like you just put oil on after a shower. Doesnt stain clothes from regukar wear. Smells good. Nice protection from the sun. * Loved this product up until i wore it to the beach. Ive been using this for a year now applying right before going outdoors for short periods of time. However this past week i took it on my beach trip where i was in the sun for hours. I applied it 3x on my first day at the beach and omg, got so burned. My friends and kids who all used lotion sunscreen did not burn at all, only me. I realized this whole time it has not been protecting my skin at all. * I just had a beach day yesterday for my friends birthday. There was around 10 people that went and of all of us I was the ONLY PERSON to leave that beach without sunburn. 

We all applied spf at the same time, unfortunately we all forgot/neglected to reapply and we all went swimming in a lake. I am so shocked that i am not a lobster because everyone else is RED today and I'm usually the first person to burn as i am naturally very pale.

I am very happy with the results and definitely recommend it for when you're ouf in swimwear to have a nice glow. 

HOWEVER, it is greasy just so you know. But it still gets 5 stars because it works so well * I was excited to purchase this product since i have used orher products from this brand, however this one is the WORST! I have used it on a few seperate ocasions and each time i burned so badly! I reapplied constantly and there were a fee times i used it and never got wet; and yet it still didn't work! I agree with other poor reviews and also believe the oil amplified the burn. So dissapointed because i wanted to love it, but it does the opposite of protecting your skin despite having a SPF 50 protection claim. * The first few words on the back of this bottle are ""clean chemical sunscreen actives"" but this isnt a clean product if that's what you're looking for.

7 of the main ingredients come up as hazardous or harmful when it's scanned into the Yuka app. Octocrylene is an endocrine disruptor and once broken down it becomes carcinogenic, studies have found. Just an FYI this isnt exactly ""clean"".

It's also a bit greasy, you'll need to wash your hands after using it before toughing your hair or face. * Because the oil lays on thick, I think it takes a long time for it to settle in the skin, so it's easy to come off. I kept reapplying, but whenever I would switch sides tanning, I felt my skin burning. The oil probably rubbed off on my towel, and I ended up burnt. I should have gone with a spray since I think it absorbs in the skin faster since it's a lighter coat so to speak.

It seems to be that you can't sit or lay down for 20 minutes while it's being absorbed since it's really easy for it to come off. * I applied and reapplied and reapplied and i am so burnt after being at the beach for jusr a few hours that you would think I never applied any sunblock at all. My skin hurts and is radiating heat. My friend and i both feel like the oil was amplifying the sun rather than blocking it. She isnt red because she has more naturally occurring melanin than i do, but her skin is painful and tight as well. I wanted to love it like i do the rest of their products I've tried, but instead I'll be going back to normal sunblock."
105,vacation,spf 30 baby oil,pimprod2038616,2596248," * I haven't used this product yet but thought I would just post a ""read the label"" warning...I missed the part about it being 3.5 oz. which seems kind of steep for the price. It's the smallest bottle ever considering how similar they make it look to the real baby oil bottles in the pics. * I used this on my legs in Hawaii and loved it. Made them so glowy and no burn even when I was on the beach all day. I did reapply after I went into the water. The only downfall is the packaging. It leaks no matter how tightly it is closed. If they fix that 5 stars * Bought for a trip to Hawaii, packed in my carry on and met clean standards for snorkeling. * Applies on evenly and makes you looks so glowy and helps you tan so much faster. I love having a tanning oil with spf in it and not have to worry about burns. This is the tannest I've been. * I got this in my Ipsy glam box and jt was chosen for me. I usually don't buy body oils or any products for tanning—I'd rather stick with classic sunscreen and sun protection. I threw this in my suitcase when going to my honeymoon in Cancun and I'm so glad I did! It was moisturizing and also helped with SPF. A little goes a long way. * I'm a cancer survivor so I'm a little overzealous with my sunscreen sometimes, I've been trying to get a little better with that and so I got a bottle of this oil. In my mind I associate oil with tanning, I was an '80s baby, but I really like the way the oil makes my skin look as opposed to regular sunscreen lotion so I wanted to try them. I have worn this out several times now, one time I spent at least 8 hours in full sun and I got a very nice base tan with absolutely zero burn, not even a little redness. 

I was hoping that the scent would be a little stronger, it's actually fairly unnoticeable in my opinion. I actually prefer the scent of the other oil but I hate the packaging on that one, could we get the chardonnay oil in this bottle? 

Overall though I really like this product, it works well. * I love the classic baby oil. From the first use, i fell in love w it! Its non greasy and i didnt burn at all. I kept reapplying and got a nice tan from it. :) 
The smell is subtle and i wish they made a bigger jar!"
106,neutrogena,ultra sheer face serum spf 60+,pimprod2030654,2592306," * I'm using this product, but only because I haven't bought another face sunscreen yet. This leaves your face looking greasy & if it happens to get in your eyes from sweating or something, it burns pretty bad. I would NOT recommend this product. * I break out over EVERY THING, but I trust neutrogena cleansers, so I tried this.  LOVE IT for daily use — been using it for 3 weeks with no break outs. * It was clear, whiched i liked but it burned my face and eyes. Will not repurchase. * This SPF made my eyes burn with the heat of 1000 suns. I wanted to love it, the application went fine at first. But I got a tiny bit sweaty and rubbed my forehead, it got in my eyes and ruined my day. I tried it one more time before tossing it. It was unusable. * Honestly I think this is a great product, I've used it almost every morning as a primer/moisturizer before daily makeup looks and it works well. I've had absolutely no experience of it burning my eyes either * This is the least greasy formula I've tried, and there's no white cast. The serum-like consistency is easy to work with compared to thicker lotions. It plays well with my silicone-based primer and tinted serum too! * I waited to review this after i used it for a while. Im not sure why people are saying it burns their eyes, i have not had that experience at all, and i sweat a lot! 

Highly recommend to all who are looking for something moisturizing and lightweight. Doesnt feel thick or greasy!!! Will definitely be repurchasing"
107,hero cosmetics,force shield superlight sunscreen broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2030344,2591983," * I just want to start this off by saying I used this sunscreen last summer and had no issues. I decided to try it out again since its at a good price point. A couple days later I went from having 100% clear skin to painful bumps/acne going up my jawline and cheeks, literally all over. I have NEVER experienced this amount of acne in my life. It took me almost a week to figure out what had caused it because I had only worn it a couple times and I have used the product before. My skin has since cleared up it was horrible few weeks trying to clear my skin. Also I'm pretty pale and this does leave a white cast. * I purchased this sunscreen because I have sensitive skin prone to redness and I needed an SPF geared towards acne-prone skin. I tried it on my face yesterday and wow, it was truly awful. First of all, it is anything but sheer. I literally looked like a ghost - some of the worst mineral sunscreen I've tried in quite some time from that perspective. Any videos you see where it looks sheer is because the person is not applying nearly enough sunscreen to hit the marketed SPF 30 claim. But I figured I'd wear the sunscreen the rest of the day, even though I looked greasy and deathly white, to at least get some UV coverage. Boy was that a mistake. When I washed it off a few hours later my skin was in one of the worst flares I've ever had -- closed comedones, red rashes on my cheeks (an area that never flares for me), dermatitis flared up all around my mouth, and raised bumps all over my face. Truly, truly awful - especially from a product marketed to sensitive, acne-prone skin. I couldn't believe my eyes. I will be dealing with barrier issues for quite some time because of this product. Avoid it like the plague. * Tried this on a whim as I was looking for a face sunscreen that wouldn't break me out or smell/taste bad like the Aveeno face sunscreen did and it worked so well I'm on my third bottle now! The redness reducing effect is not very strong, so you will still need to use other products if that is your goal. It does leave a faint white cast upon initial application to my fair skin, but fades as it sinks in. My forehead is significantly oilier than the rest of my face, so I do still have to use a mattifiying moisturizer over the sunscreen there, but on the rest of my face it gives me a natural glow. No smell or taste I can detect and I've broken out less since I began using this daily versus the Aveeno face sunscreen. Added bonus that this size is travel-friendly and kept me burn-free on a recent summer trip to Arizona. So happy I found my perfect sunscreen! * I'm loving it so far. The texture is very light and it has a slight mattifying finish on my oily skin. I'm surprised at how effective it is at helping with redness. Its not perfect, but it helps for sure. Usually anti redness products are either too dark or too green ony fair skin! * I absolutely love this sunscreen! The slight green tint really helps conceal the redness of my acne without actually looking green. I noticed my face is more clear when I use it. It's also AMAZING under makeup, its a perfect primer!! * Perfect for oily skin * This is the best sunscreen ive ever used, it keeps my skin so clear, and i love the slight green tint, it evens out the redness in my skin perfectly !"
108,bubble,plus one tinted daily mineral sunscreen broad spectrum spf 40,pimprod2041039,2616745," * I meant what I said. It feels really lovely on the skin, I'm sure it does the job as far as sunscreen is concerned, too, but equally as important? It blurs. My skin looks fantastic. * I do actually love this product. I bought it before my bachelorette and had a very uneven fake tan on my face. When I put this on, it even it out a lot and matched perfectly with my skin tone color. The only problem that I did have was that it was very splotchy and you would only notice it once you left the house. I switched over to the kylie slip tint and I would 100% recommend it more than this product. * This product advertises itself as a non white cast sunscreen, which doesn't seem to be true. It contains 15% zinc oxide which does cause a white cast. Overall it is an ok sunscreen but I just don't like how it says it's a non white cast sunscreen event though it is. On the skin it feels heavy and oiler than your average sunscreen. * I have a medium skin tone and it leaves a good finish applies smoothly and very minimal white cast. * I have seen so many people recommend this product, so i wanted to love it! For a long time, i had been using the la roche posay tinted sunscreen but heard this one wad better. In comparison, i believe the la roche posay to be better for combo oily skin with acne/hyperpigmentation. This one just looks super greasy, i have tried using with/without moisturizer under. It stings when i wear. In comparison with la roche posay specifically, this tinted sunscreen has zero coverage, whereas LRP has light coverage for acne spots/marks and hyperpigmentation. Wanted to love bubble but im afraid its a no for me. * I love everything about this Tinted Mineral Sunscreen.  The color is universal, no smell, and covers evenly. * definitely not lightweight on my skin, it feels like putting on a heavy moisturizing cream so I was worried about my oily skin. It takes a few minutes to dry/set down, but when it does it is great! It keeps my oily skin matte/satin all day which I was not expecting! my last holy grail tinted SPF was discontinued and this is replacing it!"
109,kopari beauty,sun shield on-the-glow sheer stick sunscreen spf 40,pimprod2043794,2618936," * Its okay. Doesnt provide enough protection. I still burned slightly but not too bad. Followed the directions. Wouldnt recommend for your entire body. Its good for small sections if your just running errands. * I have very sensitive skin, this product works very well, product didn't cause my face to break out or burn when applied. * I bought this as I had a trip and didn't want to pack a drippy lotion in my carry-on. I love it, I apply it over my moisturizer to my face and neck only and it hasn't caused any breakouts. Yes it has glitter , but as someone who isn't a big make-up wearer this isn't a big deal to me. If glitter bothers you it isn't for you. I haven't used it on my body as there are cheaper options for that. * Well the package is deceiving before you buy bc the yellow label hides all of the large flecks of glitter pieces * I liked this because the application was smooth and clear and moisturizing. Although I couldn't stand the strong scent and the glitters were too big for my liking. I can't rate the sun protection though * This has a great lightweight and silky feel when applied and to top it off the glittery finish looks beautiful!! * This is the best sunscreen stick I've ever used. You can use it anywhere, and even on the face it doesnt break me out. It smells nice and is so easy to toss in a bag and reapply as needed. The glitter is something I dont mind, but my bf is not a fan! If they came out with a shimmer/clear version, it would appeal to a lot of people! Overall it lasts for a long while and I will repurchase."

Have used it twice and will be taking it back. * Love the spray sunscreen, easy to use and works really well appreciate the no fragrance * Second ingredient is Homosalate, which is a toxin that is harmful for reefs. * I've been testing the COOLA Hydrating Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 (Fragrance-Free), and it has quickly become a staple in my routine! The texture is lightweight, fast-absorbing, and non-greasy, leaving no white cast, which makes it perfect for all skin tones. It layers beautifully under makeup and provides broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection without feeling heavy.I also love that it contains 70%+ organic ingredients, making it a more eco-conscious choice. Plus, it's reef-safe, cruelty-free, and free from oxybenzone and octinoxate. The 80-minute water resistance is ideal for outdoor activities, ensuring long-lasting sun protection. If you're looking for a clean, effective, and skin-friendly sunscreen, this one is a must-try!Product was received as part of an educational promotion. * This is a good sunscreen. My one complaint is that the cap does not seal the product properly. There is no click mechanism to make sure the cap is sealed. The SPF lotion is not travel friendly as said cap is loose and will not stay on the product if it's in your bag, especially if you are going to multiple places throughout the day. * Possibly my favorite body sunscreen ever. It blends in so well without feeling sticky or gross. Blends in completely clear. And NO SMELL. this is my new go to daily body sunscreen, im so happy i found it. * I had high hopes. But it left a weird film on my skin and rub off in clumps. Even after re-applying several times I still got severely sunburnt."

The first tkme I used it was a month ago and the second jusg yesterday. I had to give mh skin at least 2 weeks to recover. Im verg disappointed in the sunscreen. * ive lost probably more than half of the bottle from it leaking sitting upright on a table. * I had high hopes for this product, unfortunately it fell short. When i close my eyes, cover them, and sprayed this, my eyes were immediately burning. This product burned my eyes SO badly I could feel a sting all day long. It was extremely painful. 0/10. * Brought this product on vacation and used it as a sunscreen on top of makeup. My makeup stayed on and it did protect me from sunburn. * I was really interested in the ease of use of the sunscreen however I wouldn't recommend it nor would I use it again. Made my eyes and cheeks swollen, red, and itchy. Took a few days to go away. Also the spray isn't a light mist, it's pretty heavy. * I purchased this thinking it would be easy over makeup. The first and last time I used this product my face and neck were so red, inflamed and swollen i could not open my eyes. My daughter reported this product to the state due to seeing my face the morning after using this. Truly, beware! * If this came in the same cannister as the sunscreen spray, maybe it would work better? I spritzed it into the sink the first time to prime the pump, but there was still leakage and over-spray that dripped onto my clothes while applying it to my face. It didn't dry clear and left very noticeable marks on my shirt."

I tried this multiple times and still ended the day with new break outs. * I love how this sunscreen feels under makeup, without makeup, not so much. It works great as a primer for me, but on days I don't wear makeup, it feels greasy on my skin. Regardless, I still like it quite a lot. * LOVE IT * The 'clear coat' went on smoothly but required a fair amount of rubbing to get it absorbed into my face. 
I cannot really speak to the sun protection offered by this product as I spend my days inside at a desk. The few times I went out into the sun after using it, my face had a bit of a burning sensation for a few minutes but I did not get sunburnt/tanned. * I was recommended this since the formula seemed relatively clean and it left no white cast. BUT its SO GREASY. 

I have dry skin and this sits in my face for so long so I have to wait quite a bit to add make up. On busy mornings, I basically have to use a different sunscreen so my makeup can sit well in my skin. * Best sunscreen ever especially since I always wear a full face of makeup almost everyday. I love the clear formula and how easy it is to apply with absolutely no white cast. It really nice as a primer also. Gifted by Murad * This is a clear sunscreen and very easy to apply. It has a scent but its not overbearring. The only thing is it leaves my skin so oily and slippery. I have combonation skin and this takes about an hour to set and feel ""dry""."

It's the size of a mini. I wish the amount of product was states in the description. Its 15g. Im a small woman and the entire product fits in my palm. But its easy to apply and my kids love the texture. Makes it really easy to reapply af school. * This face stick is so much easier to apply on the kids than a lotion or spray. It smells really good and a little goes along way. Very easy to carry with you to reapply when needed. * This face stick is so much easier to apply on the kids than a lotion or spray.

I have more dry skin so for me i personally love how it adds that dewy finish, so just saying in case you don't. * I really wanted to love this because Im a big fan of their other products but it's just ok at best. The only real pro is that it didn't have any white cast, but I have light skin so thats not saying much. It also has a very strong, chemical ""sunscreen"" smell which I do not like. However, I'd be willing to look past that for an otherwise great sunscreen, but this just isn't that good. 

The texture is pretty thin and watery, but when you actually apply it, the finish is super greasy and shiny. It's beyond dewy or glowy. The first time my sister saw me wearing this she asked why my face was so shiny! So it's really noticeable, even if you let it sink in. 

I didn't try it under makeup so can't comment on that. * It felt good at first, it has a nice texture. But, it started to leave red marks on my face, so its definitely not for sensitive skin. * this sunscreen sinks in well and is watery as described. the reason I gave it 3 stars is because it got in my eye and it was miserable. * This sunscreen definitely burns the eyes. It is not that watery so it doesnt sink into the skin much. It just sits in top and makes you so greasy. * This product is lightweight and gives a nice moisture. No white residue as other sunscreens have. So far I enjoy it!!! * Recommend if you have dryer skin it gives a nice glow under foundation!"

This stuff may be good for casual everyday sun protection, but absolutely not for extended outdoor use. * use alone or under makeup. Lovely glass skin. * I passed this on underneath my cream foundation (I have dry skin), and my foundation looks flawless, and I have not gotten any extra freckles. It is a beautiful sunscreen I will keep buying it. * I used this while in Trinidad, and I was sunburned so badly. Everyhwere I used this oil is where I burned the most. * So my skin is a bit more on the dehydrated side and has left my skin looking super glowing and healthy. I apply my moisturizer, SPF then pat this on my skin it is not feel greasy and it looks amazing a little goes a long way. * I can't believe how much my skin loved this product. When I bought it I was not sure about the how it would feel on my skin. Well my skin took to it l Iike a duck to water. My skin looks and feels better than ever, even after all the sun damage I did to it over the years (I am a 60's baby who was a teenager in the 70's when we did not know what SPF was and chose sunscreen by smell, I did not do the Crisco or baby oil and iodine crazingness). It is amazing how moisturized my skin looks when I put it on, which is daily. The skin on my legs and arms look like they did 30 years ago plus I have the bonus of SPF50! The dry old lady skin on my legs and arms is gone! I would recommend this product to everyone I know no matter what there age is! * Ordered this because I use body wash with AHA and havent been protecting my skin. Got the smaller size to try it out. So far, I like it but it has a noticeable scent. Almost like honey. It may say this in tje ingredients but I was thrown off because there other products are scentless or has a sunscreen smell.

It fades with time but wouldnt be weird if you were layering scents and the honey stayed around"

THE NEW FORMULA OF THIS IS NOT IT! * I'm new to the Supergoop product line and  I really needed this Superscreen to work for me. And voila! It did! I have sensitive skin, both oily and dry if that makes sense. This product goes on smoothly, blends in vs. typical sunscreens that never seem to soak into the skin. I will say I noticed a pretty strong scent of sunscreen when I first opened it. Now, just a few days later, I don't notice it at all. I love how this makes my skin feel hydrated but not oily. And it lasts all day. I apply once in the morning after washing my face and same routine at night. * I'm new to the Supergoop product line and  I really needed this Superscreen to work for me.

I'd still put another sunscreen on if I was spending concentrated time in the sun. * I originally received a free sample and fell in love. I ordered the moisturizer and it is not the same at all. My face started stinging and itching after the second use and it doesnt go on as smooth. * i loved this product for so long, but didnt realize that it what was breaking me out. i tried a different cleanser, added an exfoliater etc. NOTHING would get rid of the harsh bumps all over my face. not until i researched and found out it had safflower it in which (can) support fungal acne. i have dry, sensitive acneic skin so this may work for others but definitely not for me. very disappointed and wish i found out sooner. not even 3 days after stopping this product, my skin is clearing up. * I used to be a big fan of the Superscreen Daily Moisturizer, and although they kept the packaging the same, they changed the formula and the name to Superscreen Hydrating Daily Cream. I think brands should be more transparent about informing their customers that they're actually buying a different product than what they're used to. The consistency of the new cream is thicker and harder to spread, but what stands out the most to me is the smell: somewhere in between Play-Doh and generic baby sunscreen. My partner has sensitive skin around his eyes, and the old formula didn't cause him any burning, but the new one does. I wouldn't buy this again."
118,kopari beauty,sun shield body glow gel spf 50,pimprod2030935,2592141," * This product looks so beautiful in the package, but was a HUGE disappointment when I used it! The thick consistency requires a large amount of product to properly cover your skin; then, it never dries down or soaks in, leaving an oily, sticky mess on the skin, which then proceeds to get on everything. I was so frustrated with the residue this left on my seat/bathing suit/phone screen, etc. To top it all off, I got sunburned! After being fried to a crisp, I saw where the directions say to apply 2 layers (you've got to be kidding me- ain't nobody got time for that, PLUS the first layer never dries anyways!), and to re-apply every *40 minutes* if in water. The typical time is 80 minutes. I'm giving 1 star for the only positive thing about it, the packaging.  Super nice pump & perfect size to throw in your bag for travel. Otherwise, this product has completely missed the mark. * Used this product on a 70 degree beautiful day and now i have badly burned arms. Be cautious with this product or only use it on your legs. * My friend and I went to the beach and we reapplied the shnscreen all day but we both ended up getting badly sunburned, which defeats the purpose of a sunscreen. I will say the oil feels great and makes your skin feel very soft especially when you walk into the water but it defintely needs higher SPF. * At first I really liked the smell, reminded me of the beach but now it literally gives me a headache.  Definitely not a gel, more of an oil and it doesn't absorb well, at least not for me.  I understand it's a gel spf oil, so probably the wrong product if you are looking for a moisturizing gel oil. * I was really shocked that there seemed to be zero glow or shimmer. My regular body lotions provide 10x the glow this does. I alsk wouldnt recommend it as an all over body spf as its not that easy to spread and blend. It stays oily on your skin and doesnt absorb. I do like the smell of this though. * I really liked how nice and silky the texture is, but unfortunately it gave me rash on my legs and arms. I was hoping this product was not the reason why i got the rash. I stopped using it for 3 months. Recently i used it agian was very excited but unfortunately after 24 hours the rash came back. * Love this stuff. It's so shiny and shimmery and smells amazing."

Humans must be responsible! * Dont buy this * A little goes a long way and more. I barely used more than a pea size amount of this on my face and it did not blend/absorb into the skin. I was left with a ghostly white face which I immediately washed off as I was on vacation and about to go out for brunch. I bought this in store without seeing the reviews, do not make the same mistake I did. DO NOT BUY. * The ingredient butyloctyl salicylate is a chemical uv filter and gives me a horrendous skin rash. I now have to read the non-active ingredients to make sure they don't sneak any Salicylates into sunscreens. If you are sensitive or can only use mineral sunscreens this will irritate you and give skin rashes that take 3 or 4 days to heal from. Or in my case I had to go to urgent care because of the rash it gave me. Stay away do not buy. I do not recommend this sunscreen. * Worst sunscreen I've ever had! It doesn't blend in at all, leaving you with a bright white look. And it transfers easily to anything you touch. * Horrible leaves white cast and purple tone * I can't speak for the sun protection qualities or anything of the sort, but I know that I'm already the kind of white where it hurts to look at me in the sun, and when I put this on, it made it a million times worse. There is no way I could get away with it. On the bright side, if you're literally white like a vampire, this could work as foundation."

I was skeptical because I previously didnt like a shiseido product in the past. However, it felt and looked really nice on my skin in the store ao I picked it up. I have been looking for a product that helps with my oily skin. This definitely dies. It protects and does not add shine to ny face. It is a very light tint where i feel great using alone at work with a little blush. I have noticed my skin being less oily and it does not create build up pilling with my makeup. Yes the product is pricey but its wirking for me. It doesn't sting my eyes either! Oily girl approved. * Super hydrating and doesnt stink! * Used under my foundation. My eyes were tearing up all morning after application. Then the sunscreen got into my eyes and no amount of rinsing helped the burning. My eyes were red and puffy all day. It took hours to feel normal again. It was the only step in my routine that I changed that day. * Shisedo changed this formula a couple of years ago and this is one time where the new product is as good or better than the previous. It truly is skin care but also acts as a makeup primer. It's great under makeup or on its own. It's not greasy at all and great for combo or oily skin. * Unfortunately it is not for me. I like the idea and feeling of the glow it has but the white cast is awful. I didn't notice the first few times because I wore it under makeup but put it on for an outdoor walk and when I looked in the mirror it looked like I stuck my face in baby powder. For reference I have a medium deep complexion. It may work for other skin tones but if you are darker then run. * Love the feeling of this, its like your wearing nothing but it does leave a whote cast on my skin. I have medium skin tone * I tried this for a while and its okay. I dont like that it gives me a gray cast and i dont like the texture on my skin.

Possibly because of the vitamin C in the formula mixed with the sun. Im better off with no sunscreen at this point honestly, severely disappointed. I tried to add a photo but the app wont let me lol * I loved this sunscreen until it only lasted me two days on the beach if you're reapplying how you should be. Very disappointing * I love it! * I got the worst allergic reaction from this product. The citrus ingredients, when exposed to the sun, increase the likelihood of an allergic reaction. I had welts all over my face,arms, and chest. * Not greasy!! Smells great, gives skin a nice glow! Love that it's vegan! Friends love it as well! * I was hopeful for this body sunscreen because I really like Supergoop; however, I found the body mist to be VERY greasy. If protected well against the sun when I was in Grenada, but it was so greasy on my skin. * This was super easy to apply. It did leave my skin a little greasy but nothing too bad. However, I couldn't get passed the strong chemical citrus smell. I will be returning."

However, I use this as stand alone sun screen, and not under make up or part of my daily skin care. It is perfect for a pool or beach day, as it is easy application due to it being a stick and not a liquid or spray. It sets in quick and can be rubbed in to set in quicker. * The sunscreen stick glides well and is portable.  However, it is extremely shiny and sits on top of the skin.  It might work well for dry skin but I would not recommend it for oily or combo skin. * Yes it's hydrating but I look haggard coz it looks oily on my face. You can pat a powder on it but reapplication is horrible. My powder puff is also soaked. * I was eager to use Live Tinted's sunscreen stick for easy SPF application and reapplication but was very disappointed after it was deemed basically unusable after just a few uses. It begins to glide on easily and leaves no white cast or color whatsoever, but the jelly-like appearance is deceiving. The product will quickly and eventually break off into small and then large pieces while applying. * I have only had the product for less than a month and the bar broke into pieces after rolling it on. When I try to apply the pieces with my fingers it leaves a white residue. I wouldn't waste my money on a product that breaks so easily after a couple uses. * I used this twice and it just started... disintegrating? I can't even use it, it just crumbles into chunks of I touch it. definitely not worth the money for only rqo uses * Just glides on your skin and does not crumble if you keep the little top on. This is now my go to sunscreen. Also is great for sensitive acne prone skin because of its hydrating formula. I like the size also because I can just slip it in my purse and does not take up lots of space. I would 100% recommend."

I don't recommend this for safe sun care. * This sunblock is awful. It pills so bad whether I rub it in right away or let it soak in for a minute. So naturally it provides no real protection. I genuinely hate this SPF and now I'm stuck with it. * I was excited to try this based on all the good reviews, but it pilled terribly, even as the only product on my skin. It also felt super sticky, and rubbed off on everything I brushed against. It never actually absorbed into my skin. Would not buy again. * LOVE the fragrance. I personally have never had issues with pilling as some others have noted. I have been using this as my go-to for two years now. * I've purchased this product before, a few years ago--no issues with pilling at that time. This time, it pilled horribly on both my husband and myself. We applied a half hour before going to the beach, and then reapplied after spending 40 minutes in the ocean. Both times it never seemed to absorb, just sat on top of the skin and felt greasy and pill-y. It pilled bad enough that I left a residue on the seats of our car. I have red hair and fair skin, so I reapply frequently to prevent sunburn. Guess who got sunburnt with this sunscreen anyway? * I was so excited about this sunscreen but ended up being disappointed! Maybe it's not made for use after being in water, but when reapplying it pilled so badly and I got burnt. It also is extremely greasy. * So I have the smaller size and I have no issues with that one, but I bought the big pump one for my trip and every time I used it it pilled like crazy on my chest back and shoulders.

With the UV getting high and having to work several hours in the sun, this stick meets my expectations. I've gotten sweaty, dirty, and wet and it holds its ground (reapplying later of course) and never gotten burnt on my face. This is even when areas like my shoulders where chemical sunscreen is applied get toasty. 

Now, it WILL leave a white cast if you do not rub it in. For my purposes, which is to protect my skin against the sun when I am getting sweaty and gross, this doesnt bother me. Yet for the makeup folks, i would not recommend this product to reapply over makeup or to use for that flawless natural look. * I have a newly healed tattoo on my forearm and I read that a mineral sunscreen can help keep it looking new.  This one goes on very easily because of its stick format and has a slight white cast after blending.  Granted, I am extremely pale, but I can see the cast on top of my black and grey tattoo.  The stick is small enough to fit in a purse or pocket.  No offensive odor. * Its solid; hes you need to blend it into the skin but once done, it doesnt have the greasy feel, it blends into the skin and it works fine under makeup (used undereye concealer over top a double application and it stayed in place- no pilling). Ill continue to use and reccomend if anyone i know is looking for a solid face stick * I took a chance on this because I couldn't find Coola's stick sunscreen. Reviews all looked good. Wow. Just WOW. It goes on thick and white. Seriously, if you're going to a costume party and don't have white face paint, this is the perfect dupe. My daughter has incredibly fair skin and this was so white it wouldn't even blend in to look less ridiculous. Remember how lifeguards would put zinc oxide on their noses? This is that level of coverage and appearance. 

On a positive note, I then purchase Sun Bum 50spf for kids. It's clear, smells amazing and works great too. * Brought this hoping it would work as well as the supergoop stick but does not. Definitely leaves a white cast in person and pictures. Would not recommended. * Definetly needs to be rubbed in after applying. But other then that it works great!"

It can be a bit greasy feeling too, but it dissipates over time and really sinks in after about 30 minutes. * Great sunscreen especially for the summer. Its lightweight. Love the gel consistency. It's not tacky or sticky feeling and dries fairly quickly - sinks into the skin nicely. No white cast on my tan skin. It * This sunscreen is good, REALLY good!

Overall the product was great. It did not leave a white hue to my light skin-tone face or to my tan skin-tone friend's face like other sunscreens do. I was out in the sun a lot and my face remained sunburn-free. My only complaint is the pump that dispenses the product. The first time I bought this, the pump simply would not work and I had to unscrew the cap and squeeze out the product. I bought the product another time and occasionally had similar issues with the pump. * This would probably work for someone with normal skin but definitely not oily / combo skin. It suffocates my pores and instantly causes me to start sweating. It doesn't wear well under makeup up, at least for me, due to the sweating. * Needs a better bottle * This is my favorite moisturizer. It makes my skin feel soft and nourished without feeling like theres a layer on top of my skin, and it does not feel greasy at all. Plumps skin too. * As soon as i put it on i start sweating it all off immediately. My skin cant breathe because its very thick. Maybe better for those with tighter pores * It good but first of all, it is only 35 spf. Do not get anything thats not over 50 spf. * This is my favorite moisturizer. I use it after washing my face and before putting on my makeup. 
I do not like the bottle it comes in. Theres so much wasted lotion at the bottom thats hard to get to unless I cut upen the bottle— and its a think bottle, which is difficult and dangerous to cut… 
I hope someday this lotion will come in a better sqeeze tube bottle similar to the cereve 50spf facial moisturizer squeeze tube/pump container."
132,supergoop!,play everyday lotion spf 30 with sunflower extract pa++++,pimprod2030630,2589405," * It was great the first few days. I loved the texture and the way it felt on my skin, but unfortunately 3 days later I broke out in a rash on my neck and chest. It was the only new product I had introduced. Maybe some people can tolerate it on their skin but not mine. * *I was gifted by Supergoop to review* My skin is typically combination, however my biggest concern with sunscreens is 1. Being good with sensitive skin and 2. Having little to no white cast since I have tan skin. To my surprise, there was ZERO white cast, and the lotion is completely white so it went into my skin nicely and left it pretty soft. I would recommend! * I love it. I put it on everyday. It doesn't make my face look oily even if I apply makeup on top. It's a great product that last for hours. I highly recommend this product. I received this product complimentary from Supergoop. * My skin is super itchy now. * Leaves a white cast. I will use the rest of it since it wasnt cheap but if you have medium to dark skin this might not be the sunscreen for you * My daughter love the super goop SPF 30 lotion it doesn't give a white residue. The whole family use it to. * I occasionally use it as a base for my make up and usually the first thing in the morning. If you don't set it with powder, it can get kind of greasy but otherwise it doesn't clog pores or make me break out."
133,neutrogena,invisible daily defense lotion spf 60+,pimprod2019316,2573916," * I used to use another Neutrogena sheer sunscreen.  It was sheer on the face and body but it left white smears over leather car interiors and dark clothing.  This one does not.  I was hesitant to try the orange looking sunscreen, but it is invisible when applied. My only complaint is that it is too hard to find in stores.  A local grocery only has this in spray-on form which is much too messy to use anywhere but at the beach.  I use sunscreen every day.. * I used this for a few weeks and didn't realize it was getting more uncomfortable, i thought maybe I'd over exfoliated or it was my makeup or something. But one day I applied it and my body rejected it intensely and I needed to go to urgent care with my face in so much pain and red blotches. Patch test but also just be wary if it starts tingling * I was hoping to use this on the face but it's very oily and has a strong smell. Does dry down nicely. It will be good for neck, chest, and hands * Really good sunscreen, as someone that has tried other sunscreens, this is the only one with good consistency and doesn't leave that horrible whitecast!! * I used this for a few weeks before I had a reaction. Over time I noticed my face felt a little stingy after my morning routine, and I just thought perhaps I had over exfoliated at some point. Then one day my face and eyes kept burning, and I thought it was my makeup. I washed my face and did my morning routine again including spf and had to wash it off AGAIN and realized it was just getting worse so I decided no makeup, but the burning?? And finally I just couldn't stand ANYTHING on my face, and I had to call out and go to the urgent care. I had patch tested it and worn it just fine for a few weeks, but somehow just developed an intense reaction to it. And removing that one item from my routine set everything right. I was disappointed and out money for the urgent care and missing work, and had a goofy red and painful face. I don't think anyone can patch test for weeks reasonably, but please learn from me- if your face starts tingling after your morning routine and this is the only thing that's new, don't wait for it to get worse. Just toss it. * I've tried many drugstore sunscreens and this is one I definitely recommend! 
It does go on a bit oily but letting it go into your skin for a few minutes it leaves a clear no whitecast application. I can put my foundation on without thinking about how it can mess up my shade! If you wear maybelline fit me foundation, this sunscreen does not separate your makeup underneath. Highly recommend!! * I really didn't care for this - the smell for me was very strong and off-putting, the texture was very oily and I didn't like how intense the orange-yellow coloring was.  It does protect from the sun, so it does the job, but I would not buy again."
134,coola,travel size piÃ±a colada classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 30,pimprod2012271,2561104," * Expected SPF 30 protection. This performed like an 8. After 30-minutes, I didn't burn but got white spots. This also smelled like alcohol and had a sticky texture. A gummy residue was left behind after showering. Not for me. * As a cosmetologist and barber, I've seen my fair share of sunscreens, but COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 is a game-changer!  It's like a tropical vacation in a bottle! The piña colada fragrance is so refreshing and fun, it makes applying sunscreen feel like a treat rather than a chore. Plus, it doesn't have that overpowering chemical smell like some other sunscreens. The spray bottle makes it super easy to apply evenly all over your body, even those hard-to-reach spots. No more awkward contortions trying to reach your back! And because it's organic, I feel good knowing I'm not slathering myself in a bunch of nasty chemicals. The protection. SPF 30 is perfect for everyday wear, whether you're running errands or lounging by the pool. Overall, COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 is a must-have. It smells amazing, applies like a dream, and provides top-notch sun protection. Trust me, once you try it, you'll never want to use another sunscreen again! This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I am loving COOLA right now. This SPF is perfect for this dreadful Texas humidity and heat. It's very lightweight, non-greasy, and has a pleasant scent. Reapplying is a breeze since the product doesn't build up on the skin or cause a film. It's very breathable and works well with general skin sensitivities. The size is quite large for travel, but still small enough to throw in your beach bag and still have space for other necessities. It has a click-locking spray top so it doesn't accidentally spray in your bag. I will say that if your skin is very dry, you may want to go for a cream SPF because this does not provide much moisture. This is definitely made for hot, sunny summers. I love it and I know for sure I am buying a full-sized bottle to keep on hand.

***This review was collected as part of a promotion.*** * As a professional in the beauty industry, I've learned firsthand the  importance of sun protection, making COOLA's  spray an indispensable asset. In an industry where skincare is very important, COOLA stands out with its dedication to not only protecting against harmful UV rays but also enhancing the overall experience of sun care.

COOLA's sunscreen spray doesn't just shield your skin from UVA and UVB rays; Its broad-spectrum protection ensures comprehensive coverage, safeguarding against both premature aging and potential skin damage. As someone deeply invested in skin health, I love COOLA's commitment to providing a product that protects and cares for my skin.

The scent of Piña Colada fragrance is delicious. Gone are the days of sunscreen smelling like, well, sunscreen. Instead, COOLA's tropical scent transports me to my last vacation. It's a big change from the clinical smell of traditional sunscreens, making the application process a sensory experience.

I did not have any issue in my delicate skin but I always recommend  a patch test.

In my personal opinion, COOLA's in spray isn't just a sun protection product; it's an  evolution of skincare. With its comprehensive protection, anti-aging benefits, and irresistible Piña Colada scent, COOLA has redefined what it means to stay safe in the sun. So, whether I am lounging by the pool or hitting the beach, I make COOLA my go-to companion for summer adventures. And a big pus smells delicious! * The COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a delightful sun protection experience. Its tropical scent evokes visions of sunny beaches and relaxation, enhancing the application process with a touch of indulgence. The organic formula boasts SPF 30, providing reliable protection against both UVA and UVB rays, crucial for preventing sunburn and long-term skin damage. What sets this sunscreen apart is its lightweight texture, which absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. This feature is particularly appealing for those who dislike the heavy feeling often associated with sunscreen application. The spray mechanism ensures effortless and even coverage, making it convenient for reapplication throughout the day, especially during outdoor activities. Furthermore, the use of organic ingredients adds to its appeal for those who prioritize natural  products. 

 In conclusion, the COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a luxurious and effective sun protection solution for those who appreciate both quality and indulgence in their routine. * As a licensed Esthetician, we our taught early on how important using SPF to protect our skin. This aerosol is easy to use and smells amazing! If you have sensitive skin I would recommend spraying into your hands first then applying. I did have a slightly burning feel when I sprayed directly. But, overall I really love how cute and small and effective this spf is to use. My skin adapted the more I used this spf. * I love this sunscreen! Its perfect for travel and smells great. I used it almost all up on my recent vacation. It smells likea tropical holiday on a beach with a coconut. I would definetly recommend. I know the spf is quality and better packaged and easily portable."
135,black girl sunscreen,kids moisturizing broad spectrum spf 50,pimprod2038237,2609781," * I got a chemical burn on my face an was desperately lookimg for a sunscreen that had ingredients gentle enough to not increase the constant burning feeling. I dead through sooo many sunscreens and this was an AMAZING choice. And even after im all healed, its still my favorite because it doesn't give me that sticky feeling other sunscreens do. * This one isnt greasy which I love and I dont feel any burning/itchy sensation after applying it. * I use this everyday. It feels amazing on my skin. It doesn't burn for me but can sting if it gets into my eyes (normal). It doesn't have to weighty feel that a lot of other mineral sunscreens do but still feels like a nice moosturizer. And ++++ that it works great under makeup. I tried so many sunscreens before and this one stands above all else. * I apply this sunscreen daily. I have been using this for a couple of years now. I've strayed a couple of times, but I always come back to this. I have sensitive skin and eyes, and this is the only one I have found that doesn't irritate my skin, or sting my eyes. (I slather this all over my face, including my eyelids) * I love my BGS Kid's because it feels amazing and moisturizing on my face! I was recommended this by a friend, and it leaves no white cast. I don't like gel-consistency sunscreens, so I was stoked to find a classic lotion consistency, this one works great for me! * most moisturizing sunscreen i've ever tried and it feels good on my skin. I'm a darkskinned and it leaves a nice glow
HUGE CON: makes my eyes burn and makes my eyes water throughout the day everytime i've worn it, you HAVE to make sure to not put it around your eyes. started using it on my body instead of my face. * Been using this for years and I absolutely love it. Goes on a bit oily but dries down after a few minutes. Leaves my skin moisturized and protected without a purple cast. Highly recommend and have put a my friends and family on to it too."
136,shiseido,urban environment vita-clear sunscreen spf 42,pimprod2039504,2612331," * Excellent choice for those with sensitive skin. Infused with vitamin C, it offers effective sun protection without causing breakouts. The lotion leaves a slightly shiny finish but doesn't make the skin oily, making it a great base for foundation. Highly recommended for its lightweight feel and skin-friendly formulation. * Goes in clear which is great fir those ""no makenup days"" 
Very hydrating and gives my skin a nice glow. I wear in the summer time and my face always feels protected. 
Id tou are jot into the glowy/dewey look, id recommend a diffrent product! * I really like this sunscreen! It absorbs very quickly, lightweight, and help controls my oil production throughout the day. I still have to blot my face in the afternoon, but it helps. I also like to use a water base moisturizer underneath :) 
PLEASE NOTE* a little goes A LONG WAY! 
Your face will be a grease pit if you put too much on, learned the hard way. * I dont get why some people love the ""dewey"" effect because at least on me, when I put this sunscreen on, it felt like I just spent the day frying stuff in the kitchen and all sweaty, right after my shower! It went straight to the trash can. * This sunscreen reminded me of a drugstore formula, not something I'd expect from Shiseido. It has an oily, sticky texture - not like your typical Shiseido sunscreen or a clear sunscreen like Supergoop. It's greasy, doesn't absorb well, and it stings the eyes terribly like a poorly-formulated budget buy. I really dislike it and will be returning it."
137,tula,mineral magic oil- free mineral sunscreen fluid broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2025972,2584410," * I use under any makeup or alone. Doesnt make my face break out and provides SPF * I love this!  it's a mineral sunscreen for face that truly goes on clear.  It has a beige tint til applied.  It adds a natural glow and makes skin look beautiful.   Perfect for mature skin.The expiration date (on the box and tube) isn't always great - 5 months.  The tube leaks into the cap, so I store mine with the tip upward. 
it's spf30, so it's efficacy is 2 hours - so reapply.   I highly recommend this for a mineral sunscreen. * It's lightweight and easy to wear but I dont feel like it protects me enough from the sun. I feel like I need to apply so much for it to work. Plus it's very small for the price. * The first bottle i bought was perfect. The sunscreen is incredible and makes you look so glowy. Doesnt break me out. I didnt have an issue with the bottle leaking. I just bought a second bottle and it is just not travel friendly at all. Half of it spilled in my toiletry bag. Id love for the packaging to get fixed so its not leaky but the product itself is top notch. Only sunscreen id ever use on my face * I do like this. It has a slight tint that when applied it's hardly noticeable but sunscreen seems a little drying but not as much as some other tinted sunscreens that I""ve tried. Would buy this again. * I find this sunscreen perfect for sitting under makeup or wearing it alone. * This sunscreen has Butyloctyl Salicylate, a cousin to octisalate, and a chemical UV absorber. That's how they can get a higher SPF with such a low concentration of Zinc or TO. So it isn't purely mineral. I like it and use it, but I wish they wouldn't market it as 100% mineral when it has unregulated chemical UV absorbers in it."
138,blue lizard australian sunscreen,sheer mineral sunscreen lotion for face spf 50+,pimprod2043669,2621977," * Although it's a sheer mineral sunscreen, I found that it's still difficult to completely rub into the skin and leaves a white cast (like most mineral sunscreens). I really wanted to like this brand as I've also tried their other sunscreens but they're just not for me. * I agree with many other reviewers about the product's comfort on the skin, easy to rub in formula, and ease of washing off compared to other mineral sunscreens. I switched to this from the CeraVe facial moisturizing lotion with SPF for a higher coverage and mineral. After about a month, my entire face was broken out, from my forehead line, temples, cheeks, chin, and jaw, all red under the skin bumps that were super itchy. Even though it's an otherwise clean product, make sure to spot test this a few times before buying! * I really wanted to like this sunscreen, especially because of the protection from blue light. However, this product isn't for me. It takes quite a while to rub in, and a white cast is still inevitable. It also feels greasy after a few hours of wear. I wish Ulta would restock the Jack Black sunscreen I have come to love over the years! * I tried the blue lizzard Sheer Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Face SPF 50+ and I was very impressed. It is very lightweight and goes on sheer. I have very dry skin and most mineral sunscreens leave my skin uncomfortably dry after 2 hours. This is not the case with the blue lizzard sunscreen. I am able to wear it and reaply without my skin feeling uncomfortable. This is a great product for the price. * When applying the proper amount, it does leave a white cast on brown skin. But feels great on skin * I was recommended by a dermalogist to use blue lizard. I have dark brown spots.I have been using this product for over 6 years. I have noticed a difference on my face. * I've heard nothing but good things about this brand and when I ran out of my current face sunscreen, I decided to try this one. I love that it's an SPF50. That's honestly the only positive thing I can say about this sunscreen. It comes out pretty runny, but it's the consistency of Elmer's Glue and I imagine that this is exactly what it would feel like if you tried to rub glue into your face. On top of being difficult to apply, it leaves a horrible white cast. This one was a miss for me."
139,sun bum,daily 50 face gel,pimprod2043277,2619923," * this sunscreen was peeling. i would wait ten minutes between my moisturizer and sunscreen and even then when i began application the sunscreen would immediately start to pill up. i had to wipe my hands between sections of my face and wipe off the flaky resedue. it does get you matte, but only for a bit. after one hour my t-zone would be so shiny and oily. this sunscreen is not good and too much of a hassle to keep up with. do nit waste your money on it * This sunscreen is a great texture. Only problem is if it seeps into your eyes, it burns really bad. Do not put this under your eyes or on your eyelids. If it didnt burn then this woild be a awesome sunscreen! * I bought this sunscreen before i realized it has 5 oils including coconut oil which makes me nervous due to the high chance to clog pores. But i decided to still try it and the texture is really nice. I love that it is at least SPF 50, clear and easy to blend yet feels very hydrating and light. I love that it's water resistant most likely from the oils which makes it very smooth. * I have been using this sunscreen for about a week now, and i am loving it! I have extremely oily skin, so it's important to me to find a sunscreen that doesnt feel heavy or greasy. It blends into my skin very easily and wears well under makeup. It hasn't broke my skin out either! A lot of people have commented on the smell of it, but i do not notice any smell while applying it to my face. I will definitely keep using this sunscreen!! * This sunscreen changed my life, im normally sensitive to sunscreen and this one is perfect * I hate dewy sunscreen. Ive tried all big popular brands (supergoop, shisedo, elta md, etc) and this is my got to. I reach for this spf over all the others beacuse it feels light on my skin and has a matte finish. I have acne prone skin and feel/ look gross with that dewy shiny finish. This sun bum fel is simliler to the super goop unseen but feels breathable on my skin. I give it a good shake and have no problem getting the recommended amount on. I see a few reviews say it smells bad- but i dont think it has any scent. I wear this everyday. * I really like this formula. Reminds me of Supergoop but less silicone-y and my skin felt like it breathed more. My issue was the scent. I am normally not sensitive to smells but this smelled like something spoiled and it didnt go away quickly. Like burning rubber and cat puke. Surprised more reviews havent commented on it."

Depending on whether you want: dewy, mattifying, silicone, etc. 
This is more matte, and depending on the foundation you use, you'll need primer too. But it's 100% worth a try! I'll be re-purchasing! * An Ulta employee so graciously put me on to this product when I came in looking for a primer with SPF coverage and wow, did they deliver! Goes on super smooth and has no issues with clinging to dry patches or pilling (though if you're having issues with pilling, check what products you're layering under this! Jojoba oil/rose hip seed oil have never given me issues). Helps to even out my makeup and leaves no noticeable white cast under medium coverage foundation. This is quite a dewy primer, which may not be suitable for super oily folks, but works great with my combo skin. Took me about 5 months of almost-daily use to fully use all of the product, so I feel like the price is more than fair given that is satisfies the purpose of both a primer and daily SPF. Just make sure to shake it well before use to combine the product and help the pump function better! * I love this stuff, the formula is thin and watery but it leaves the skin silky. It does not pill at all under makeup, and feels super loght weight. * did nothing for me * This profuct is AMAZING!! I absolutely love everything about it. The texture on my face, the scent, the blurring effect. Key is to let it dry at least 3-4 minutes before applying the next skin regimen step. * I'm south east Asian with neutral light to medium skin tone and this left a white cast. My makeup didn't settle well with the primer. don't want to throw it away so I use on the body for extra SPF. * I sooo wanted to love this product but the smell is so horrible. I think I got a bad batch because I haven't heard someone else complain of the smell. The texture and prime this product has is just so incredible though ;("
142,sun bum,mini original spf 45 sunscreen face mist,pimprod2044628,2625244," * I love this refresher spray. Plus, it has SPF. I mean, I don't count on that for the amount of SPF I need, but it's a bonus. If you don't like scent, this isn't for you, but I love it!  It doesn't stay strong, but every time I spray it, someone comments how great it smells. * I LOVE THE SPRAY. but not sure if its my fave daily sunscreen. I like a lotion sunscreen but this is convenient. Smells like all other sunbum products (banana/summer) and i layer diff spf products. * I use spf makeup but this is perfect to carry and apply when im oitside with out ruin my hair or makeup * Love this face SPF mist for a nice cooling effect. Recently went on a beach vacay.  I used this product throught the day. I could pull it out of my bag and quickly get my SPF protection with a clean clear light mist. It was cooling as well which was a great plus in the hot climate.  A light tropical scent that dissipates quickly. So glad i had this. Works great. I would definitely encourage others to purchase if just for the ease of use. I sprayed over makeup too. This is a great performance product. * Smells strongly of fake banana, burned the skin while applying, left me feeling sticky and greasy."
143,supergoop!,play lip balm spf 30,pimprod2043481,2620424," * I live in Florida and have VERY fair skin - the sun is crazy strong here and I want to keep the freckles on my lip lines at bay. So, I spotted this while buying other Supergoop products and thought it was going to be a slam dunk. I've been forcing myself to use it religiously for a week now, and… I just don't hate myself enough to keep doing it anymore! It tastes bitter, which I can deal with by layering something over it - but it's also weirdly *gritty*?! Somehow, it ends up IN your mouth way more than other lip balms do, so you'll be forced to taste this disgusting rainbow far more often than is normal. On top of that, it's pricey for the size.

I'd never buy this again - it's already relegated to the bottom of my beach bag. 

(Pro tip: You can buy a 3-pack of Hawaiian Tropic lip balm for less than the cost of one tube of this stuff. It goes on smoothly, smells / tastes SO MUCH BETTER, and doesn't melt/break down in the heat of a car or beach bag. Plus… did I mention it's a fraction of the cost?!) * I'm not sure why this product leaves a better taste in your mouth. I understand it is a sunscreen lip balm but after putting it on, I could taste a strong bitter taste in my mouth like chemicals and it's lasted for hours. I'm sure I'm not allergic to this product and that's just maybe the sunscreen, but I do believe it should be formulated to where it does not have any chemically taste, if you're only concerned as protection from the sun and might not be bothered by the chemical taste and I do suggest to purchase, but it's a hard no for me. Also not sure why it's labeled as açai. I could not taste it (flavoring) and it did not have a pink hue. * I have never had any allergic reaction for almost 35 years of my life.
I have used old variant without any mint/acai and i loved that one. So trusting the brand, i bought the one with Mint this time.
One application of this Lip Balm (mint) and I end up having horrible allergic reaction.
My lips are burning, swollen, extremely dry, red, itchy. Wish I could add an image.
Hoping it clears soon, its been 3 days now. It pains while eating and even smiling.
Save yourself! * it doesnt taste bad at all, especially being an spf lipbalm. i love it, but the big box for an average sized product is kinda… meh. * It feels great on the lips. It's not sticky. It also smell good. What I hated was that it taste like sunscreen. I understand it's sunscreen balm but I just couldn't  love it. It taste like was eating sunscreen. * I was looking for a lip product with SPF for the summer months and running outside. I love the flavor and texture of this product, and it is very moisturizing. I do with it was slightly thicker so it would stay on a bit longer. * extremely moisturizing, the acai one tastes mostly like sunscreen but the point of the product is sun protection not yummy taste. overall really enjoy this product!"
144,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen stick spf 40 invisible sun protection,pimprod2043900,2620575," * don't be fooled by the the good reviews, the ingredients are comedogenic and made my skin freak out. I have a painful cystic pimple from using it and am really upset about it. * Love everything about this sunscreen like all the comments. It glides very nicely and truly is unseen. 

However, it did move the make up a lot on a hot day - I didn't set my concealer and contour which are all cream products, so I cannot speak for powder or after setting spray. 

Next time I probably would blot my face first, and glide only once and not back and forth. * Gifted by supergoop. This is really a great sun screen that is not tacky that would pick up sand or give that greasy feeling. It gets in the wrinkles/hard to reach spots with a fine tip and the other side is wider for large areas like forehead. This is great for putting on yourself or others * Goes over makeup super well if you have a fixing spray (not just a setting spray. A FIXING SPRAY) on top of the makeup… so it's amazing for an outdoor summer or destination wedding/bachelorette/baby shower/wedding shower/event in general. Etc. gifted * . * I bought this product because of the rating thinking it would be a great product but it wasnt at first it felt great on the skin but whenever i tried washing it off it would burn my face sooo bad  then the second time I pit it on my face was soooooo dry and flaky. I totally don't recommend * I really wanted to love this, as i have several other products that i love. However, if your skin is on the dryer side I wouldn't recommend. I even used it on my young son while on vacation in FL and his poor face was also very dry."

146,blue lizard australian sunscreen,sheer body lotion spf 50+,pimprod2043668,2621972," * I ended up with Basal cell skin cancer. I asked the dermatologist what brand of non-toxic sunscreen would she recommend that would NOT leave you looking white. This is what she recommended. It worked great! It goes on white but when you rub it in it doesn't leave a white film on your skin at all.  I have tried the other Blue Lizard applications and they all seem to NOT leave my skin white. So far no sunburn and I am happy. * I will use this sunscreen for now on.  Family took trip and no one was burned during our week vacation.  The sheer sunscreen does not leave white film on skin so the kids loved it also. * Keeping in mind that i am fair/light complexion - I love this sunscreen. I have very sensitive eyes so chemical sunscreens are completely out. When it comes to mineral sunscreens many feel dry and cakey on my skin, which also leads to eye irritation because I also have dry skin. This has been a good in between satin finish once it dries down, doesn't emphasize any lines on my face, and doesn't irritate my eyes. I use this as a facial sunscreen daily and it wears well under makeup and doesn't have large white cast on my complexion. * I loveeeee this sunscreen! I did not burn at ALL - spent 8+ hours in the sun in Puerto Rico for multiple days and felt good about getting some sun without damage. Its thick when you squeeze it out but rubs out silky. * Just received today, and really enjoy it upon first impressions. Applied this sunscreen to my face and it was so easy to blend out and didn't feel drying as the day went on. It did look a bit shiny, so I fluffed a bit of translucent powder over my t-zone to take care of the matter. I can't speak for how it performs under makeup, but I have an inkling that it will look beautiful. After trying my fair share of sunscreen over the years, I think this one will be my new go-to. I only ever buy mineral sunscreens, and this one is pretty exceptional. * works very smoothly, didn't have any bad reaction to it and I have sensitive skin. highly recommend!! * The sunscreen itself blends well and feels ligjtweight. Only con is that it'll leave white stains all over your clothes and other belongings. You have to wait about 30 minutes after applying for it to fully absorb and not leave stains. If you have the time to wait then it's great! But not recommended for someone like me who rushes in the morning and doesn't like white stains."
147,bliss,block star mineral daily sunscreen,pimprod2027018,2584854," * This is the first suscreen ive tried since switching from chemical sunscreen and by far I'm satisfied with how great the wuality is. Its a smooth application, non oily/greasy, AND no white cast (I have light/medium tan skin). Id definietly recommend this product if looking for a mineral suscreen that's non-comedogenic, lightly scented. * This mineral sunscreen has blown me away. It goes on so smooth, does not bead up in heat. After applying it, I don't need to use primer. Amazing product!!! * This is one of my favorite summer products. I use it alone as a skin tint - SO easy and the finish is perfect. But it is tinted to suit fair/medium skin so it's dark on me before I have a tan. Please please please make more shades!! * Not good * I feel like this is a good tinted sunscreen for those that have oily skin. It's thick but doesn't feel moisturizing at all. I live in the desert and do a super juicy skincare routine and have oily skin. Because my skin is beyond drenched, when I put this on last, that dewiness still comes through and I feel like my skin doesn't look massively oily as the day goes on. But again, I'm doing a lot of moisturizing steps before hand. If you're dry or doing light skincare, this is gunna make you look parched. It gives no coverage, but I think it tamps down my redness a little bit. I haven't tried this under makeup. The color looks dark out the tube but on me (light tan) it blends well. Darker skin will probably have a white cast. It does transfer so watch out for your clothes. My main con is the smell. It's like a citrus kitchen cleaner that's heavy on the cleaner part. Not pleasant at all. It goes away, but lordy I hold my breath until then. * My favorite sunscreen so far. I have medium - tan skin so I have a hard time finding sunscreens that dont make me look like I have unblended white on my face. This tint is perfect and not overpowering. This is great for people who want a natural look and sun protection. I dont feel greasy or oily either. * This is my everyday sunscreen. It has a slight tint which is perfect for me even with my fair skin. With this, a little spot concealer, blush, brow tint and mascara, im good for the day. I do set with a light setting powder and it wears beautifully. I purchased almost 4 times already and will continue to do so. Great product"

Also didn't find it has any tint. Nothing special about this product. Only pro is no white residue as some natural zinc products have. * Yellow/orange tint, verrrrry noticeable. I typically love Dermalogica products, this one was a disappointment. * So orange, I would never be able to blend this to make it look OK. it was comical how fast it went from the white out of the bottle to a very deep orange. * I REALLY wanted to like this due to the price but it was absolutely terrible. It flaked on my skin so bad. The first time I used it I used it on it's own and blended it with my fingers and it left flakey streaks on my face. So the second time I used my skincare first and tried to blend this in with a beauty blender and got the same results. Both times I shook the tube well according to the label and got the same results. Very sad this didn't work for me! * After putting it on for a few days (maybe 3). My skin next to my ears starting to breakout. Now anytime I put it on my skin turned hot and itchy like crazy. I love this brand and has other products from them with no issue. Not sure why my skin doesn't like this. * Non greasy sun protection that works well alone and under makeup. Does blend in with your skin color and slightly blurs skin brown spots and blemishes. * Hey Ulta, Dimethicone is a silicone. This product should not come up with your silicone free search filter."

Keep the sun away. * sensitive skin,  prone to break outs with lots of new products.  this sunscreen was great! * It does the work! No skin burning, no irritation, no strong scent. My husband and my son both work outdoors for a good portion of their jobs and they have no complaints! * Im reading a lot of reviews and honestly yall dont know how to use sunscreen. Why are you spraying it directly on your face and over your makeup. If you are using it on your face spray some in your hands and pat it of your face and also do a patch test when trying new products. Everyone skin is different. * The best sunscreen for me. * I bought this just to use to go to the beach, but the next morning my skin looked so good. I started using it daily as part of my morning routine and I get compliments all the time about my skin. I saw someone didn't like that you couldn't spray directly to the face but honestly as an oily skin girl, it really should be rubbed into the skin, otherwise it just sits on top very dewy. I am at work at 7 and normally oily by 1 but since using this, I have a nice glow but significantly less oily than I am bare faced. I also don't wear makeup to work, drink lots of water, and barely get 6 hours sleep. So I promise you it really is the sunscreen because my habits have gotten worst but my face is still improving from being acne prone and very sensitive. They make a version specifically for face I want to try. * Love this product, i spray a little in my hand and rub into my face, neck, chest and arms for an amazing glow. My coworker kept saying this is something extremely beautiful about your skin…had to share my secret lol"

152,hero cosmetics,force shield superbeam sunscreen apricot spf 30,pimprod2036749,2605374," * I keep buying this. Great for my sensitive acne prone skin. Blends beautifully. I have fair skin but the green sunscreen leaves a cast on me. This one is perfect. * Finding the right sunscreen is so hard, especially when you only want mineral formulas. The one I used for several years got discontinued. I tried SO many before finding this one. I don't have acne prone skin so I had kind of overlooked this brand. It's a decent amount of physical blocker but feels super lightweight and not greasy. I love the slight glow from the apricot tint, no white cast at all. All my usual makeup products sit very well on it with no pilling. And most importantly it seems to do it's job well. Make sure you use enough, you can't skimp with sunscreen! * I have tried all types of mineral sunscreen and most are too drying or too oily. Once this sets on the skin it dries down nicely without being overly anything. I will be repurchasing over and over. The tint looks like it would be too orange but when you put it on it disappears pretty good and just blends in. I add a little concealer and light powder on top and I'm good. This is not a substitute if you want a foundation type coverage. If your skin is relatively nice or you are comfortable, just put it on conceal the areas of concern and go about your day. I think it is good for more mature skin than wants a glow. Powdering does dim down the glow too. Love it! * This sunscreen is completely unusable. As soon as this touched my skin it began pilling and peeling. There were huge spaces on my skin that the product refused to stick to, and the parts it did stick to were a pilling mess. Plus the color is way too orange. The packaging is weird too. It has a pump on it which is completely unnecessary for a squeeze bottle and it makes it difficult to get out the proper amount for the 2-finger method. Do not waste your time or money on this sunscreen. * I am a long time fan of the green version of this SPF. Love how you can get every last bit of product from this packaging, plays nice with makeup, never breaks my very sensitive skin out. Great product, figured I should give this one a go! 

…well, first pump and I just knew this was going to turn me into a jaundiced oompa loompa! But I gave it a whirl just in case. If I wasnt Type I on the Fitzpatrick scale I'd be fine but I could see bits of orange sticking in my eyebrows and onto the dry bits of skin. I did look a bit orange, especially with the anount of sunscreen you are meant to apply for full coverage. Lovely glow finish but it made my foundation look like it oxidized, when it's usually perfect. 

I'll stick with the green version :) * I have combo/oily skin and have been trying various moisturizers with SPF. My skin is also acne prone, so anytime I use a chemical sunscreen I break out. Because this is mineral zinc based, I've seen no breakouts or irritation! The formula is light and easy to apply, and the apricot orange-ish tint surprisingly works fine for my light neutral complexion. Downsides are the pearly shimmer aspect, the slightly tacky feeling, and some pilling near the end of day. I much prefer a matte/natural finish, but if you're going for dewy/glowy you'll probably love this. 

I tried the other Force Shield too, and hate the green aspect since I don't have redness, but love the smoother matte texture more than this one. SO my solution is to split the difference- one pump of each and mix before applying lol! I wish Hero would make two new formulas to add to the collection- one basic like the green but with no color, and one with a lighter apricot/neutral tint and no shimmery stickiness. 

Overall: love the price, no breakouts or irritation, light formulas, mineral zinc; wish it wasn't shimmery or dewy. * Its okay, im on the paler side and this has a tint to it, somit makes me look orange-ish. 
Its also really oily feeling on my skin."
153,black girl sunscreen,make it matte sunscreen - spf 45,pimprod2030390,2592310," * Black Girl Sunscreen is the only sunscreen that I use. It doesn't leave a white cast on my face. I like that it has a matte finish. * Love how my skin feels * Even with vigorously shaking this product comes out partially gelled and partially liquid, so I dont trust the SPF stated on the bottle because you cant uniformly mixit. I also put some in a travel container and it completely separated with a firm gel lump surrounded by oily liquid. * It keeps me from looking extra oily, but it doesn't stay matte all day. * No white cast! This product goes on with ease smoothly so far my favorite sunscreen * I wanted to like this so bad because I tried the mineral formula, but this caused my skin to react so badly that I had to exchange it for something else. * If you're used to slugging or remember when your mother used to put Vaseline on your face in the winter to protect you from the elements then this will give you the same feel. I'm going to use it as a winter moisturizer because it goes on light but becomes really greasy."
154,supergoop!,mineral sheerscreen spf 30,pimprod2029938,2589387," * This is the only sunscreen I use!!!  If a sunscreen doesn't break me out, I can assure you it most likely will not break you out.  EVERY sunscreen out there that says acme safe breaks me out, even Elta MD!   This one is AMAZING!!!   Supergoop customer for life!!! * I have tried several high end mineral screens, they all leave a white cast, but this one blended properly does not. It does not smell, it is weightless and perfect for use under makeup or on it's own. I go between their mineral face tint and this one, I do not always want or need color. I recommend this line to everyone, and they do NOT test on animals * I've tried all of Goop sunscreen products. I like the way this texture blends into my skin, does not have a strong ordor like Every Single Face or greasy feeling like Unseen. * Got this in the travel size, as it was the tiniest mineral sunscreen I could find. It's fine, but a bit heavy if you use the recommended amount (takes a while to soak into my normal-to-dehydrated skin after skincare) and on a humid day it feels quite cloying. But my big issue is that it smells like rancid peanut butter. Why??? I can't see an ingredient that would cause that smell, but based on other reviews it's normal for the product. There's better out there, unfortunately those brands don't make minis so I'll prepare to smell like peanuts when I travel lol. * This is by far the best sunscreen gor acne probe skin.  Every sunscreen on the market that says ""acne safe"" or ""non comedigenic"" still break me out.  I have VERY sensitive skin and eyes, and this bever burns or stings.  It does what it says it does.  It also does not pill under makeup.  If yoy're a dark skintone, you will HAVE to wear fou dation over this, as it does leave the normal mineral sinscreen white cast. * Its moisturizing and leaves a slight white cast for my POC folks and I havent gotten sunburnt while on it. Doesnt feel too heavy but you'll notice it on your face. No chemically smell and doesn't make my eyes sensitive. Its good under makeup. Haven't tried it in water. Great for folks with combo, dry, or normal skin types. It does what it says it does, but nothing magnanimous especially considering the price and quantity. Other sunscreens at lower price points get the job done the same, if not better. For acne prone skin, Good Molecules and Hero have good sunscreens as well. Otherwise, its worth a try if you want a physical sunscreen. * This formual is amazing. I love the finish it has and I have no textural problems realplying this every 2 hours.

The spray nozzle sprays the perfect amount and the bottle itself is easy to take with you anywhere. I don't have to worry about the white streaks of not blending well. It makes it also easy to reapply sunscreen during the day, especially if you're playimg in the water. The lightweight formula is non greasy and works efficiently! A summer must have! * Smells great & lightweight, non-sticky. I applied this  for two days only on my face. The third day I applied to neck, chest , shoulder , arms but unfortunately that evening I developed a heat rash. I obviously have allergy to an ingredient in this specific item and not everyone will have same reaction. I would def do patch test first if concerned. Otherwise I would have continued with product If I didn't have allergy. * I bought this to keep on my car for reapplication throughout the day. It is a fine mist that sprays evenly and layers well over makeup. Exactly what I was looking for!"

This goes on so white (like all mineral versions), but it never fully seems to soak in. You're left with a cast on your skin, and worst of all you'll burn. * The whitecast is crazy. I tried rubbing it in for a long time. I mixed it with a tint, that didnt help either. Here is my leg/foot after a few hours of wear, and I can see where my sandals rubbed it off, but that just shows how crazy the white cast is. Im naturally med-tan skin. * Leaves my face feeling so greasy and doesnt absorb into skin. I'm left with my face looking paler than the rest of my body. * Its so thick that it would not absorb no matter how hard I rubbed it in and it made my legs loom straight up WHITE. I felt like I rubbed toothpaste all over myself. * My dermatologist recommended this mineral sunscreen. I was previously on la roche posay spf face moisturizer but since it wasnt mineral, my doc wanted me to switch. Instant horrible white cast which was quite comical. It smells like rubber tires. I broke out in a rash by day 2, my skin feels like reptile skin. Took a break on day 3 but on day 4 it burned after i applied it. It pills and was blotchy on my skin. Im officially done with this spf. * Has a white cast that just doesnt rub in. Not worth the hassle * Does not absorb into my skin. Makes my face look very greasy"

Would definitely repurchase. * The only sunscreen my sunscreen-averse husband will use. He finds it convenient to spray (his face, bald head, body, everywhere), it absorbs quickly when rubbed in, and it is the most effective one at preventing burns of the many we have tried. * Ive given this sunscreen many chances and everytime it gets into my eyes. It burns for a while too. As soon as you use a towel/rag to soothe your eyes a minute later they'll start burning again. This can happen for hours. Wanted to love this because it doesn't leave a white cast if you rub it in enough, but the eye burning isn't worth that. * i bought this in store at the beginning of summer after an employee recommended it to me. i'm a natural redhead, so im pretty pasty and prone to skin cancer/burning easy. i was hesitant because it was super pricy - but a little goes a long way!!! i work outside in the sun all day and have every day for the summer, and i havent burnt ONCE since buying and actively using this. i still have over half the bottle after 2/3 months. it is so worth the money. * I really wanted to like this BUT I've used it a few times and for some reason, after about an hour, even though I'm not sweating, this sunscreen starts to get in my eyes and even my mouth! Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation. It has Benzophenone in it, which can cause contact  dermatitis. I get an allergic reaction on my eyelids every time I've used this product. * OMG this is the best sunscreen I've found for my skin, it's refreshing and soft and doesn't leave your skin white or thought of it.

I have NO idea what other reviewers mean when they reference glitter. I just applied it and made sure to shake extra long and don't see glitter. There is a slight shimmer, but nothing close to glitter, in my opinion. It also doesn't break me out, which can be an issue for me with sunscreen. My only complaint is that it doesn't play as well with makeup as I would like. * ok guys I read reviews saying there was glitter. I had been using this for a week no issue. I  went on a vacation with this and noticed glitter on my face and hands....turns out I wasn't shaking the bottle before applying.   But while traveling the bottle was being shifted around and mixed up the glitter.  I'm not talking about gold dust shimmer....I'm talking actual glitter for possible craft time.   I really hate glitter I had take all my makeup off to get rid of it all .  If  you like  that much glitter pieces on your face then cool! you might love this one! but for me the glitter just drives me nuts.  the formula is ok ...it didn't irritate my skin. I would prob * I love this product.  I use it as my foundation as it is light, glowy and I get compliments on my skin when I wear it.  I have not encountered chunks, ( I shake like crazy as mineral sunscreens need it.) it is easily applied over moisture and concealer.  The scent dissipates quickly.  I have mature, dry, sensitive skin and have not experienced cakiness, dryness or irritation. I am a fan of this product. * I really really like it, i have tried many spf with color, and this one i can tell is one of my favorites so far,  dont know why it has received so many bad reviews, it doesn feel greasy or dry, it doesnt smells bad like many people says, is like chocolate scent, it leaves little glitter but doesn look bad, you can barely notice, the shade is really good on me, others are too dark, or pink, this one is the perfect shade, I've even received compliments on how my skin looks, im kind of yellow pale skin color, so i strongly thinking on buying the full size, after i finish my Kosas. * This was recommended to me by an Ulta sales associate and when I sampled it, loved it. However when i used it at home there are gritty particles in it that do not go awaw no matter how much you shake it. There are much better options out there. * Too drying for mature skin.  Color is off. Returning. * Chemical UV filter ingredient Butyloctyl Salicylate gave me a horrible skin rash that sent me to ER. I do not recommend! Not a true Mineral Sunscreen. If you have sensitive skin or allergic to chemical sunscreen please do not use. Avoid those chemicals sunscreens."

I use this product before leaving home or going to work in my garden. You have to apply daily to cleanse skin fifteen minutes before sun exposure. The scent of the peach blossom is not a heavy scent.

The body lotion doesn't leave your skin greasy. The coola body lotion kept my skin nourished and hydrated throughout the day.

I also generally dislike the oiliness of most sunscreens.  I will say that this product was better than most at covering up the ""sunscreen smell.""     But you still could smell it which is why I gave it a 4 not a 5.   As far as feeling oily or heavy on your skin, it did not rub in as easily as I would have liked it too and it still did feel a bit oily, as if you need to wash it off at the end of the day with a wash cloth.

I live in a very dry climate and find this is all the hydration I need for daytime. Lightweight feeling, doesn't pill or sting near my eyes, and plays nicely under makeup. Also layers/reapplies nicely throughout the day. Would love to eventually see a higher SPF in this same formula that's also FA-safe! * I like it! It's a small bottle, but, I like it!

I recently purchased the Beauty of Josen Suncreen and its a lot better for oily skin. * Makes me look like a ghost. Leaves a very bad white cast and does not melt in, unless you rub your face for 20 minutes. It also pills under make up and makes it uneven.

For the high price this should do what it says. Sounds like there was some sort of change in the formula that ruined it. * This was recommended by my esthetician. And it works well for me. I like that it has sun screen in it and it doesnt seem to make my face oily at all. It works for me. * It left my skin very oily and I bought it because it was supposed to be matte. * I usually break out from sunscreen. Even the one my dermatologist prescribed! I went out on a limb to try this 2 in 1 sunscreen and it did not disappoint. Great mattifying and no white cast (I'm a brown skin gal) yet moisturizing. I took this on vacation and it withstood the very hot heat and sun. Two thumbs up for me. * My previous tube was great. Mattified the skin. Absorbed quickly. It did not make my skin oily. This newest tube is not good. While it still absorbs quickly it does not mattify my skin. I am very oily in a couple of hours if not before. I must note that i do shake the tube before use so i dont think im missing anything. * I used this as a cheaper alternative toy usual SPF  but it was greasy and broke me out. If i dont shake it i can see the oil."
170,black girl sunscreen,make it hybrid broad spectrum spf 50,pimprod2036754,2606302," * I switched to this from the lower spf one and its horrible. It smells kind of perfumey but it says fragrance free. Also, it leaves a horrible white cast and clogged my pores causing me to break out. Ive decided to just switch brands completley * I have oily skin so I bought it thinking it would have oil control. No, it made my face even more oily * I don't know if they changed the formula, but this product gave me a TERRIBLE white cast… I thought it was supposed to do the opposite.. * takes so long to rub in, leaves a white cast, didnt even make me glow like my other black girl sunscreen * The formula has definitely changed for the worst. In the past I would highly recommend but this new ""mineral"" change is horrible and caused a rash and skin burn. Also very watery. Will no longer be using or buying this product. * So, I specifically like this sunscreen for myself, but there are a few reasons I might think it wouldn't work as well for others.

Pros:
-Lavendar essence?  Honestly that's a bonus when you work outdoors, a lot of insects don't love lavender, and I genuinely think it helps repel them a bit. For reference I worked out in the deep woods near a wetland all of last summer.  I put on this sunscreen and my usual bug spray every morning and I barely got bit, it was wild.  Can't say for sure if that was the reason, but hey, didn't hurt.  If you like lavender, it's a bonus.

-I have -very- sensitive skin.  I can't put that banana boat SPF 50 sport on my face or neck without it irritating the heck out of me (sometimes my arms too).  A lot of sunscreens (even ones that are supposed to be for the face!) do the same thing to me.  This one?  Never had that problem.  I can use it on my face and body and it's SPF 50.  No itchiness, no irritation, no problems. 

Cons:
-I'm white!  I don't recommend this to my friends who have darker skin than me without mentioning that a lot of folks with actual melanin notice a cast from it.  This is unfortunately something I've seen about this one specifically on multiple sites.  Maybe one of the other products from this line would be better?  Bit of a bummer when it's supposed to be for darker skin tones.
-If you don't like lavender or are allergic to it, stay away!!!  I love it but not everyone does.

Tl;dr it's great if you're sensitive and like lavender but it leaves a cast if you have a darker skin tone. * Love it"
171,undefined beauty,r&r broad spectrum spf 50 sun serum,pimprod2035000,2616920," * This sadly burned my eyes pretty bad, but it felt and looked nice on the skin overall. * This product is runny and its a mess. Not into runny products running through my hands or face. * The only ""light"" option isnt a good fot for all European or light skin tones.  It says its neutral but it leans pink/cool. * For those who love a dewy/shiny finish, you're good.  But for girls like me who have textured and/or oily skin, this is a big nope.  And that's really the only negative.  Otherwise, this would be the perfect sunscreen.  The medium was a great match for my skin tone, nice thin formula, didn't pill, good ingredients, comfortable on skin, SPF 50/PA++++, water-resistant.  Really, it has all the makings of an HG, but I just can't pull off this shiny look.  PLEASE, please make it in a natural matte or invisible finish.  I beg of you! * I have tried many sunscreens, I have many sunscreens. I will happily keep this in the rotation. It didn't leave a cast on my skin, though I can only speak for the light shade. It felt moisturizing (I do wear it on top of actual moisturizer) without feeling thick/greasy like some SPF. It was not irritating at all. Overall- solid choice. * i love this product! the packaging it's self is so cute, the formula is amazing i love the way it feels on my skin! * It makes my skin so glowy and hydrated"
172,peter thomas roth,max mineral tinted sunscreen broad spectrum spf 45,pimprod2024035,2579755," * This is the only tinted sunscreen that doesn't flare up my rosacea. It goes on creamy and gives a light, natural coverage for even looking skin. For me, it lasts all day. * I have lots of acne and post inflammatory erythema. This tinted sunscreen doesn't have much tint. I have more fair to light skin and it is a little dark for me and therefore makes me skin almost look worse. it doesn't seem to even out any redness just makes it look like I have patchy darker skin tone in some areas. the finish is natural and glory and it's beautiful, but after wearing for about an hour or two the tint is almost all gone in some spots and looks so patchy. * So far this is the best mineral sunscreen I have found, yes even better than Tachas's. Tachas dries my skin and made it flaky eww. This stuff makes it moist reducess just as promised and keeps my face from sunburns. I don't like that at first when first applied my skin looks shiny but I prefer that to the dry film others leave and ive noticed that onces it has time to soke into my skin its fine. * I definetly recomend this as onenodnthe best mineral tinted sunblocks I be ever found. * Best spf! Mineral based. Doesn't pill. Nice tint (medium to very light tan skin tone). Helps skin look good. Pair it with powder= compliments on my skin. Hard to find when I first started using. Glad I spoke up back in the day.  Please do not ever stop making this product or change I ingredients. * I have spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars in search of a sunscreen that doesn't have me reluctant to apply it in the morning. I've done my research and know that mineral sunscreens are generally considered more effective than chemical sunscreens, but most mineral sunscreens leave a white cast, pill under makeup or over skincare, or leave my skin dried out by the end if the day. 
This Peter Thomas Roth tinted sunscreen is the first sunscreen I have used that doesnt do any of that. It's the most cosmetically elegant sunscreen I've found as it applies like a blurring, color correcting primer. The tint is a neutral tone with a slight yellow hue I would say. It is so much nicer than the other tinted sunscreens I have tried that leave me with an orange or pink coat on my face. It dries down to a satin matte finish, and most of my makeup products layer nicely over it. The only reason it loses a star is I find it settles under my eyes and makes my IT Cosmetics bye bye under eye concealer (a reliable holy grail concealer for me) crease under my eyes by the end of the day. It's likely only noticeable to me, but that's my only complaint. If you're better at setting your undereyes than I am, this will probably check all of your boxes. I've definitely found my go-to sunscreen. * I have searched high and low for a high spf that ALWAYS pairs well with other skincare products and/or with makeup without pilling. This does the perfect job. I wear it alone or it is a perfect base before makeup. I've repurchaed it 3 times and will continue to do so."
173,murad,correct & protect broad spectrum spf 45| pa++++,pimprod2031643,2592791," * Chemical sunscreen causes my eczema to flare, and most physical sunscreens leave a horrific white cast. This does not. It's also fragrance free.

The bottle is so tiny for the price, which is the biggest con. But otherwise I have zero complaints. * I tried super goop because everyone said it was so good but it left a dirty feeling residue on my face in turn making my makeup splotchy this sunscreen does not do this also does not leave a white cast on your face i also love that this product heals while protecting * I am so in love with this product that I buying it for Xmas to give it as a gift to my family and friend * This serum has good healthy ingredients but the mineral sunblock that is in it ruins the whole serum. The serum will not melt into your skin. Then if you put makeup on over it, the makeup will not apply evenly and the makeup sits on top of your pores and fine lines and accentuates them! This serum also was not as greaseless as I had hoped. It was a little greasy. So I don't recommend this serum at all. The sunblock in it is 17% Zinc Oxide. That is most likely the reason it never melts into your skin. The price is also very expensive. * It blends into the skin without any white cast but I feel it doesn't get absorbed easily, feels greasy and uncomfirtable on my skin. I can't get past the fact that it feels tacky on the skin for such a long time. For the price point, I'm sure there are much better product out there . * sensitive enough on eczema prone skin during the summer time! * Had high hopes but, after using the full bottle, I did not see any ""Correct""ing benefit. BThey should take this word out of the name, it is misleading.  Also it smells a bit unpleasant which mostly dissipates.
It did give me sun protection but I can get that from a much less expensive product.
Overall a disappointment."
174,pacifica,vegan collagen every day lotion spf 30,pimprod2017151,2566493," * It's sunscreen in a nice skincare bottle. It works, but feels nothing like a face cream and everything like any regular sunscreen. * It's a cute bottle but it jsut smells like straight sunscreen. It's not that greasy but it's nothing special. * Love this for daytime. Light, and I don't need very much. Gentle on my sensitive skin. * We accidentally ran out of this, and we will never take this product for granted again! * It was just too greasy it started to break my skin out * I generally love Pacifica and have only purchased vegan/cruelty free products for the past 30 or so years. My usual store didn't have Andalou SPF face lotion anymore, which I've used religiously and happily for many years, and this was the closest alternative. I have never had a bad reaction to any lotion but this one irritates my eyes horribly, to the point of not being able to drive safely and having to wash my face and flush my eyes. Do not recommend! * I love this brand and I was excited to find a daily moisturizer from them with spf and even went through several bottles but I had to stop using it because it caused my eyes to burn and water profusely. I would also add that it has a very oily finish, so if you have oily or combo skin, this likely isn't for you."
175,shiseido,travel size ultimate sun protector lotion spf 60+,pimprod2043992,2622105," * When I first received this product, I told myself, no way I am buying this again for a sunscreen (because of the size for the price). However, as soon as I put it on I fell in love. It smells great, leaves your skin super soft, and it stays soft! I have an oily complexion so I have yet to put it on my face because it does feel a bit oily when you put it on. However, I noticed if you rub it in properly it just sinks into your skin. My neck and chest in particular look and feel amazing after using this.  Its not over powering, it doesnt leave a cast, a little goes a long way, and I did not have any irritaion. Yes, it is pricey, but like the other Shiseido products I have tried, I love it. * Perfect sun block, sits well under make up and gives a nice glow when I wear it alone. I am medium/tan and does not leave a white cast. 
Wish the fullsize had the same dispenser as the travel size. * I was hoping this sunscreen would feel more like a lotion or a serum but it feels EXTREMELY oily, even after shaking the bottle for a while. It felt like it was just sitting on top of my skin and never absorbed. I had a significant breakout after using it for a few days, this is the first sunscreen I've tried that caused my skin to break out in many small pustules all over my face. * It smells like peaches, is light weight and feels like a serum when you apply it. It doesn't pill or burn your eye. * It smells like peaches, is light weight and feels like a serum when you apply it. It doesn't pill or burn your eye. * I've read so many amazing comments so I tried out this sunscreen. It feels VERY oily. Like you're putting straight sunscreen from a can and spraying it on your face and the feeling doesn't go away. I also broke out like crazy after using this product for a week :( * This is so greasy its not even funny. It doesnt dry down at all. It smells nice but is way too strong. Only good thing i can say about it is that it does go on clear, no streaks or whkte cast."
176,coola,fragrance-free mineral body sunscreen lotion spf 50,pimprod2003905,2541372," * I've been using this sunscreen for a few years now and really like it! It works well for me because it's a sunscreen I'll actually wear. I love the soft non- greasy feel of this product. I don't feel slick or sticky when I apply it and I've never had it irritate my skin. I also love that it truly has no fragrance at all! I'm of  European heritage and have very pale pink skin and this sunscreen looks quite natural on me. It keeps me from burning and keeps my skin comfortable and looking good while doing so. I couldn't ask for more. * I have very sensitive skin so I have to use a fragrance free mineral sunscreen.  This is one of the best mineral sunscreens I have found.  It sinks in well and dries to a non-tacky finish so I can use it for every day without it being a greasy mess.  You do have to rub it in, but that is to be expected with a mineral sunscreen.  The best part is that it does not rub off onto your clothes like some mineral sunscreens do. * This product is horrible if you have any skin tone except fair. Literally so white and even with 5 minutes of rubbing it into your skin, your skin is grey with stripes of whote because it does not absorb. I have medium tan skin and it makes me look ill. Save your money! * This product is horrible if you have any skin tone except fair. Literally so white and even with 5 minutes of rubbing it into your skin, your skin is grey with stripes of whote because it does not absorb. I have medium tan skin and it makes me look ill. Save your money! * Used this on a trip to Hawaii (this is a reef safe sunscreen) - my kids used it when they went snorkeling. It does leave a white cast on skin, but that is to be expected considering the active ingredients and the high SPF. They came back from the snorkeling trip with a nice tan (we have naturally olive skin, so we tan even with sunscreen) and no burns. I use this regularly on my face to boost the SPF from my daytime moisturizer. It does not feel greasy and it doesn't appear shiny at all. There is an almost imperceptible (not visible in photographs) white cast, but I can live with that. I also use it on the backs of my hands and arms to prevent a ""car tan"" and it has worked well for that so far. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and I would buy it again. * Do not buy! I'm actually headed to Ulta right now to return this. It'll leave a white cast on any skin tone! And it doesn't blend into the skin no matter how much you rub it in. It's also really dry feeling. Skip this product all together.! * I gave this product one star because it does protect from the sun. But I hated everything else about it. It does not absorb it just sits on top of the skin and it's so white. It's very thick and took a long time to apply. It gets all over everything. Not just your clothes, but anything else you touch or bump into. And it is just as difficult to remove from your skin at the end of the day. I threw this product away after using it a few times."

It is on the shiny side-takes maybe 10 mins to fully set once applied to the skin. It is on the pricy side but is very hydrating &spreads easy! * I have tried every super goop and I can't understand why i still get sun! Will not burn eyes at all! No white cast! Does not mess up makeup application. * I needed to return due to leaving skin sticky and too shiny. * Lovely scent, penetrates easily, works well under my No. 1 moisturizer. * This is the best sunscreen with such a grt refreshing aroma.. properly soaked into skin and there no eye irritation. I am goin to buy one more * Great product, doesn't leave oily residue, lightweught formula. Perfect for under makeup. Does not irritate my eyes and smells great. Very similar yo European formula."

180,sun bum,original glow spf 30 sunscreen lotion,pimprod2030636,2592174," * I've been using this daily for a little over 2 years now. For reference, I have incredibly sensitive and acne-prone skin. While the glow is nice and it is great for SPF, it broke me out because of one ingredient (bismuth). In the new year I am trying to remove all skin irritants and unfortunately I will not be able to repurchase this product. * I like this sunscreen, it is light and absorbs easy and leaves a really nice glowy finish. The downside is that it STAINS clothing and does not wash out. I realized this a little late, and I'm stuck with a bunch of shirts that have a brown stain around the collar and sleeves. The packaging also sucks, the product runs out the top often and spills out. * amazing! but the packaging sometimes leaks out of the bottle into the cap. otherwise i am so obsessed!! 🦍☀️ * I want to love this sunscreen, but the packaging is such a deal breaker that I can't justify purchasing it anymore. The screw-on cap does not work with how quickly the liquid product flows out of the tube. The formula would make so much more sense with a pump dispenser or some other type that would prevent mess when using it. I have to believe that the packaging hasn't been improved in order to keep the price low, but it just defeats the cost benefit when I waste product becauss too much flows out. I'd pay a bit more for this product if I could use it without wasting it. I won't be purchasing again unless the packaging is updated based on customer feedback. Sunbum, please fix this! * I've tried quite a few different sunblocks for my face, and they all feel way too thick and make my face feel oily. This is my absolute favorite that I've ever used! It leaves such a nice glow and honestly makes my skin look great. I want to try wearing it as a daily sunblock, but am a little worried that daily use will cause my skin break out, but I guess that I won't know until I try! I do wish they made this in a bigger bottle so that it could be used for the entire body. * I don't know why i keep trying to like sun bum products. They're all mid or below. This sunscreen is basically a liquid. I was expecting more of a lotion type of formula. It is very runny, so when you go to dispense product, be careful and don't squeeze- otherwise you'll make a mess. * IT ACTUALLY WORKS ON ALL SKIN TONES AND COLORS.
I LOVE this sunscreen it is moisturizing while providing sun protection and a BEATIFUL GLOW. It works well under makeup also. I do recommend applying an actual moisturizer on with it because it works as dew drops. It provides great protection.
I rate it 10/10."
181,sun bum,daily 50 face lotion,pimprod2043279,2619924," * Absorbs in my skin well and doesn't feel greasy or heavy during the day. * Great daily sunscreen
Feels just like a mosturizer
Would definitely recommend for those like me with texture and scent sensetivities. I haven't found any other sunscreen this great! * I don't consider myself to have sensitive skin- acne prone, yes, but not sensitive. I can throw everything but the kitchen sink at my skin when it comes to exfoliating and my skin takes it beautifully. I used this product daily for about a month and started to see some irritation. Thought it was maybe the change in seasons or my other actives. I cut back on those products and the irritation got worse. Started to look like a rash / dermatitis thats caused by heavy moisturizers. Didnt even think thats it was the sunscreen until it was literally the only ""new"" product on my face. Went back to look at the product more closely. Contains coconut oil, which as an acne prone girly, I know this is very comedogenic / clogs pores / causes dermatitis. Sad because I liked everything else about the product- price, packaging, consistency, absorption, efficacy. Just doesn't work for my skin. 😞 * I started using this sunscreen and I genuinely do like the way it feels on my face and has a pleasent scent! It does protect well considering I was outside for hours and my face did not burned however, if it got into my eyes (just from me rubbing or from sweating) and it would continuously keep burning my eyes. 

I really want to like it however, I may switch back to bare republic mineral sunscreen since I had no issue with that."

It leaves a beautiful glow and deeply hydrates but again, not for oily skin or if you leave in hot weather.Too heavy for a day cream * I got this product with high hopes. It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy. I don't like the packaging, but i've noticed a lot of brands going this route so its whatever. I would recommend it though."
183,kate somerville,hydrakate illuminating spf 50+ drops,pimprod2044974,2625521," * This takes a long time to dry down and isn't very illuminating. * So this dispenser is very skinny so not alot comes out at once. You have to keep squeezing to get out enough. Its also super illuminating, so for both these reasons I didnt use enough product. That is on me, but the price point for the tiny bottle that's hard to squeeze makes it not work for me. I also could see how some would find it greasy feeling. The finish is beautiful though. * I bought this because the reviews seemed great. This did not work well for my skin. Instantly made me super oily. I have sensitive skin so I'm glad this didn't make me break out nor havd an allergic reaction. * Why do the online ingredients not list fragrance? The box does. It smells strongly of essential oils. I literally hated putting it on my face. And if that wasnt bad enough, it stayed wet for hours. What the brand calls 'illuminating' looks oily to me. I wish this had been in stores to try before buying as I could have saved having to return it. * First of all, I did NOT receive this product for free. I paid for it with my hard earned money, so my review is legitimate. I like this suscreen! I was previously using Murad's mineral SPF religiously, but that came with a more expensive price tag so I figured I'd give this one a try. I like this one better. While it does not have titanium dioxide like the Murad, it does have a higher concentration of zinc. I like the texture, consistency and glowy effect of this product. The fragrance is a bit much and can be overwhelming when first applied. I would (and will) repurchase. * This product applies well, has excellent ingredients for my preferences. The pull off cap needs a grip of some sort. The consistency and tint are great for me. It is wet though. It goes on wet feeling and stays wet. Not like an oil. * I live in Florida and am obsessed with sunscreen year round.  I am a believer yhat its the most important part of any skincare routine. I try anything new that cones put and have my favorites for different scenarios.  But, this, by kate sommerville is my new overall favorite.  Its a fluid like cream with a slight tint but I wouldn't consider it tinted.  It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any residue.  It made my skin glow, hence the illuminating.  Its perfection with a 50 spf."

I dont really recommend it as a setting spray but as a suncreen it is a great product to use over makeup. * it was nice to use * greasy and sticky. * I have NEVER had a setting spray completely DESTROY my make up until now. Total waste of money. There's no setting properties to this spray it's quite literally just spraying regular SPF 50 on your face. * couldn't get past the chemical smell or stickiness on my face. did not like the product * While I want to love this as an easy means to reapply sunscreen throughout the day specifically designed for the face, it breaks me out. Its small enough to be relatively travel friendly and the spf aspect works great, I've brought it with me to reapply many places and for all over my body as well as others and everyone who i know thats used it hasnt had any issues with it's effectiveness, i cant use it if it breaks me out. Im not prone to breakout at all. I think its the fragrance, im not a huge fan of the scent either. All in all, if fragrance doesnt affect you id maybe suggets giving it a try however there are other similar products on the parker that dont cause issues. * SO greasy and smells terrible. Better used as a regular sunscreen on the body, but the smell is so potent, like rubbing alcohol"

It provides a lovely, refreshing boost to your skin, especially on hot, sunny days. The formula is lightweight and non-greasy, leaving no sticky residue or shine on the skin. What's more, it's perfect for indoor use, as it doesn't contain high levels of sunscreen, yet still offers numerous benefits. I'm particularly fond of the fact that this product is vegan, cruelty-free, and made with clean, organic ingredients. Overall, I highly recommend it. Additionally, its compact size makes it perfect to take on the go, fitting nicely in your purse or clutch. Although it's a bit pricey for my liking, considering it's a sunscreen product, I believe the clean ingredients used by this brand justify the cost. ""This product was provided for promotional purposes in exchange for my honest review,"" * I'm so sad! I used to LOVE this product. It would give me the most beautiful dewy finish and smelled amazing. I just bought a new bottle yesterday in-store and it's completely different. The smell is similar but not nearly as good, the moist is not as fine, and IT DOESNT HAVE A DEWY FINISH!!! It just seems like I spraying water in my face now with no other benefits. * I love this brand, but I would not buy this again. I have purchased this 3 times (for myself and family), and all 3 times the bottle has leaked all over my bag, and wasted money. Get the lotion and save your money. * I sprayed this on my face before driving home from work and within 20 minutes my eyes were stinging and burning. Im guessing it migrated into my eyes. Also the coconut fragrance lingers on your face for a long time. Really disappoint overall and cant wait for my eyes to stop burning. * It's a light mist that does feels slightly sunscreeny- but not too much that it turns me away from it. I have oily skin and I hate using face spf for that reason so I wanted to try this instead. I like the light feel and it didn't irritate my skin. * I like that it doesn't have alcohol or a smell like the setting spray version but it is pretty oily when applied. Also wish the SPF was higher. I went though the bottle quick since I kept reapplying before I noticed how oily it made me. It would be great for dry skin girlies. * I think there are better spray sunscreens on the market for a better price. I'm really debating on returning this. I've used it three times, and each time I'm happy with the glow, but it very quickly turns to grease and my makeup slides off. I think for the price, you're better off getting something else. Also, the packaging is pretty but it's not practical. I bought this to put in my pool bag and my hiking pack, but it's glass packaging… I get making sustainable packaging but this isn't practical for what I'm using it for."
188,neutrogena,"sport face oil-free lotion sunscreen, spf 70+",pimprod2032290,2595050," * I began using this sunscreen years ago and like others, am not a fan of the new motor oil smell of the current formula.
I continue to use it because, although the smell is terrible, the formula remains effective and keeps me from burning in intense sun and it's modestly priced for an oil free sunscreen that's high in SPF protection. That's what keeps me coming back. 
Keep in mind, this is a sunscreen lotion and not advertised to be a daily moisturizer. I use another SPF product by the same brand for daily use. I only apply this product prior to outdoor activities. * This is my tride and true. It looks fabuslous on its own and underneath makeup. There is a slight white cast that is eliminated with enough blending. I also notice it helps lessen the amount of sweat thats produced on my face. I workout everyday in an unconditioned gym in the south, need i say more?

This is it * I hate this sunscreen. I thought it would have a flawless finish like all the korean chemical sunscreens I like. It leaves a white cast on my face as if it were a mineral sunscreen and does not completely rub in no matter how much I work it in. And then it does not dry fully either, it just sits on top of skin. Surprisingly, it doesnt make foundation pill, so that gets a star. I will not repurchase. * I didnt get a sunburn but it is very hard to rub in so you need to apply alot of product. * I used the old version for years and it was nearly perfect; hydrating, easily spread, and non irritating. The new version takes a lot of work to spread in, leaves a white cast on my skin(nc45), clings to hairs, and isn't hydrating enough. * I've tried a few sport sunscreens and this is one of my favorites. I wear it everyday before my workouts to protect my skin outdoors and indoors from harmful UVA/UVB rays. I sweat a lot and it doesn't burn or sting my eyes which is a plus. One of the cons I have to note for others is, it is a little bit thick and greasy like a lot of sunscreens, but that doesn't really bother me personally. * Leaves you with a white cast after trying to rub it in."
189,coola,refreshing water plumping gel serum sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2043266,2620583," * This has quickly become a must have product for me! I always have issues with sunscreens looking cakey under makeup, not being hydrating enough, or looking greasy throughout the day. I'm also always in a rush in the morning, so I really only want to wait a minute or two for my skincare to sink in before putting on my makeup. I was on the hunt for a suncreen with a serum consistency that wore well under makeup on my dry skin. This is just that and MORE! 

The first time I used it, I was blown away by how it made my skin look throughout the day. It was like I had a smoothing filter on. My makeup actually looks better with this on underneath! That is something no other suncreen has done for me. It's also very plumping and calming for my tired morning skin. On top of all of that, I actually did notice that my skin looked more relaxed than usual at the end of my work day in tech. I swear staring at a screen all day is giving me fine lines, so I was excited to see the digital de-stress technology, but I definitely did not expect to see immediate benefits. I assumed it would be more of an overtime thing. That was a fantastic surprise that really pushed this product over the top for me! * after a couple hours of applying i got a terrible rash on my face and neck. it got super red and itchy. i do have sensitive skin and always use mineral sunscreens so that may be why but ive just never had anything like this happen before. nothing this major * I love this moisturizer! From the first touch, I knew it would be a game-changer for my dry skin. Honestly, it's so different from the texture: a lightweight gel that hugs the skin like a cloud. It melts into my skin, leaving it plump, refreshed, and super-smooth. This is amazing. I've never felt this moisturized, and my skin is still dewy hours later. One of the best parts about this produce is how light it feels. Though it provides such intense moisture, it does not feel heavy or greasy. It just wakes up my skin in the morning and keeps it looking fresh and dewy. It layers beautifully with other skincare products, and I have had no issues applying makeup over it. GET THIS PLEASE ESPECIALLY DRY SKIN GIRLS!

 ""Product received as part of an educational education."" * about me:
skin: combo-oily
makeup: yes, and I double cleanse and prep skin.

I've been trying this sunscreen for some time now. While I can say it feels nice on the skin, it unfortunately broke me out quite a bit. For one, it is relatively fragranced, which I'm not usually opposed to but can see this being an issue for some. I do wear it underneath my makeup after i've prepped my skin and give it enough time to try, but have noticed that by the end of the day I significantly more oilier than if I prepped my skin without it. I don't doubt that the sunscreen doesn't allow my skin to breathe nearly as much, but I probably wouldnt recommend this product to someone who is looking to apply it under makeup or have sensitive to oilier skin - which is unfortunate as I was hoping the serum aspect of the product would have been better for my skin type compared to a thicker mineral type sunscreen. Overall, its not ""bad"", just not for me! * i got this for free and i was very excited to try the brand. while it had a great feel on the face, i did not like the white cast that it left. i decided that even though there was a white cast, i was going to purchase it when i ran out until i noticed the price. there are sunscreens out there that do the same thing for a fraction of the price. im not willing to pay almost $50 for a sunscreen. * I did not expect much from this sunscreen at all, honestly. I usually stick with Asian sunscreens as they have exceptionally elegant lightweight formulas with filters far more advanced than those you can find in the US. I got a sample of this, however, and was genuinely surprised by the formula and how it felt on the skin. For reference, I have oily-combination skin, so a light SPF is a must. This sunscreen definitely fit its description of a gel serum- I would say that's definitely how it felt going on (maybe a tad bit more of a gel cream, but still quite light, regardless), and in my experience, it sinks in quite quickly while still leaving the skin feeling the skin hydrated and moisturized. I don't typically use moisturizer when I use this, but that's just what works for my skin personally. I have very sensitive eyes and this also did not sting my eyes at all when applied around my eye area, which is a huge plus for me as that can turn me off from a sunscreen completely. Different things work differently for everyone so I would still recommend getting a sample and trying before spending this much on a sunscreen, especially as there are lots of incredible SPFs that are MUCH more affordable, but finding a sunscreen thats actually enjoyable to use can be extremely hard so I definitely appreciate finding one (a US sunscreen, at that) that feels this nice and would absolutely recommend.

***This was purchased with my own money. This is NOT a sponsored review in any way and all opinions are my own. * I'm always on the hunt for a sunscreen for my face that doesn't feel sticky and hot.  This one isn't quite the naked feel I'd like, but I think it's the best I've found so far.  Unfortunately the cap won't come off so I have to screw off the top to access the product.  I'm assuming there's a pump under the cap which would really be convenient, but I'm going to have to pour the product into my hand.  Disappointed in this defect for the price of the product."

Makes you look ashy. * Left a white cast that wouldnt go away. And it doesnt rub into the skin. * Do not buy this product. It was so bad it was on special and now i know why. Leaves a white cast, is greasy, and doesn't absorb into the skin at all * I absolutely hated this sunscreen. Worst white cast ever, you cant make it go away no matter how much you rub it in you will still go down 3 shades once you put it on. since I have sensitive skin I thought I would try out this brand but it made my skin issues worse. Also, not a great sunscreen to wear if you are planning on getting in bodies of water. I should have looked at reviews first before buying do not make my mistake. 
L * Stains everything white and doesnt ever absorb. I feel dirty for the rest of the day and look like I'm covered in lead paint makeup. Can not express how much I hate this sunscreen. * Horrible product. Leaves a white residue on the skin even after 12 h of application. Buy only if you wanna look like a clown * I'm highly upset with this sunscreen as I brought it on vacation to use after I used up my other one. I put it on expecting it to be better than my Neutrogena one but it is 10 TIMES WORSE. My legs look white as a ghost. BUY ANOTHER SUNSCREEN!!!"
191,dermalogica,invisible physical defense sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2014440,2560948," * Love this mineral sunscreen! Used to use Aveda's mineral sunscreen but switched to this one a couple years ago and I'm so glad I did. This has a higher amount of zinc oxide, and slightly less white cast. Plus, the hyalauronic acid keeps my face looking hydrated—Goop's mineral sunscreen has a nice smooth texture but very drying and makes my skin look cakey. I struggle with melasma due to sun or heat exposure, and this Dermalogica mineral sunscreen is great for daily use. However, if I'm spending the day outside like at the beach or park or hiking, I do have to use something stronger to keep melasma and sun spots at bay—like Nuetrogena sheet zinc face mineral sunscreen. Nuetrogena leaves a brighter white cast because it has higher zinc oxide, but it fully protects my skin from direct sun. * This is WAY too thick! I couldn't spread it around. I will be returning this. * Great protection from sun with 20% zinc oxide! * It leaves a white cast, * I wanted to love this sunscreen since I love Dermalogica products but it does have a heavy greasy feel once applied on your face. Unfortunately, I will be returning this. I have a medium complexion and combination skin. It did not leave a white cast. * Estoy feliz de averiguar encontrado ente producto soy alérgica al sol y necesitaba encontrar un protector físico estaba desesperada por mi alergia micara y cuello y brazos llenos de ronchas no sabía la diferencia entre físico y químico cada año iba a emergencias por los granos odio tomar medicamentos ahora estoy con mi bolsa vacía pero sin granos gracias dermalogica * This suncreen is….def something makes me feel rlly greasy take forever to blend if you want a fast absorbing sunscreen this one is NOT for you it literally takes a whole day for it to feel somewhat not greasy on your face, dont get me wrong i have sensitive skin and i like how it didnt break me out BUTTTT  THE WHITECAST IS INSANE, im the whitest dominican there is to exist and it got me over looking purple😵‍💫 theres so many better options for cheaper😭 atp im just using it to cope with the fact that i spent that much money on it, your better off buying the la roche posay sunscreen"
192,coola,zinc oxide liplux sunscreen trio,pimprod2013049,2562546," * No overwhelming bad taste.  Nice colors.  Lasts waaay longer than other products I've tried.  Offers effective sun protection.  It IS a little drying but only a LITTLE.  I've tried sooo many different tinted sunscreen lip balms.  This one is top quality as far as I'm concerned. * Terrible chalky texture. Colors are not flattering. I'm still searching for a decent spf tinted balm. Tossing these. * These are soooo dry. Feels horrible!! Will be returning asap * The Coral Reef shade didn't come in my set, Firecracker did. I was looking forward to trying the coral shade the most. Just wish the set was actually the colors advertised! I think the formula is decent, but a little overpriced. * I really like thses.  They smell so good, like mint.
Wish they were available in store. * First off I'd like to say that this is the first time I've tried a tinted SPF lip balm! And I really like what I've tried so far! I've tried these for about 10 days and I really like how they feel on my lips. They are very moisturizing, silk texture and made in such pretty colors! My favorite is the Firecracker color. I like how nicely it glides on and doesn't feel cakey nor weighed down. I love the fact that these has SPF and I don't have to worry when I'm swimming at the pool if I get dried out lips. Also love the fact that this is organic, Vegan, and made with natural ingredient's and safe for the earth. Such high quality products and I'd love to test out other lip balm colors and also try other COOLA products! Perfect for the beach! * First off, I've only been using these for about 5 days and I'm absolutely OBSESSED. I love that it comes in 3 different shades and flavors but mainly the variety!

One of the first things I noticed about the lip sunscreen is how well it works, some products it takes a few days of using it for the effects to really work but this worked immediately, usually my lips crack and dry out depending how long I'm outside but this actually hydrated and protected them from cracking or drying out. One of the other things I loved was the fact you can barely even tell your wearing it! It doesn't feel weird or oily or cakey! And the other thing I loved was the fact it came with 3 different flavors! I highly recommend this product for anyone wanting the perfect go to lip sunscreen!!

Smells good too!  Will buy again! * The smell is great, but the sunscreen itself is awful. Even after reapplying it did NOT work. Do not get this sunscreen. The price and the awful sunburn afterwards is definitely NOT worth it!!! * Second time I've tried a sunscreen from Coola very disappointed both times. The scent is horrible and smells old even though it isn't expired. It will ruin your day is you put it on before heading out to the beach/pool because the smell is so awful * The texture is really nice, but the smell is off. Has a stale smell * Coola's sunscreen lotion went on easy and without a greasy, oily film. It lasted well throughout the day, and smelled great! * Put this on before going to the beach and then reapplied, still ended up a lobster. Not a fan unfortunately :( * This product gets the job done. Feels smooth on skin without feeling greasy. I also appreciate the business model of Coola. Scent is not fresh and tropical like piña colada infers. I'll use this again but maybe buy a different scent next time"

I am a light warm olive tone and this works great for me. Its not fragrant but it does have ascent similar to the Laroche Posay tinted but thats mild and dissipates. This spf is also more hydrating than the Laroche Posay in my opinion as well as having a lighter, more neutral tint with a similar liquid consistency .I was suprised it doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes. I can use it under and over my lids and thats a big deal! My other skincare products are all FAB so it made sense to check it out! The literal only complaint i have is that it isnt water resistant. So i have to grab something else when i go on vacation, etc. this is a perfect your skin but better finish! * I love this product so much I am literally on my fourth bottle! I've always had problems with sunscreens burning my face an eyelids however this is the only one I've ever found to not give me that problem. I like that it's a little bit tinted and makes my skin look even while providing SPF coverage. love love love * I have dry, fair, sensitive skin. This sunscreen is great. I put it on after my serum and moisturizer. I've been using it for about a year. No irritation, no sunburn. Good stuff. * I'm way too pale for this. If you're the lightest shade of foundations fair/pale you're not the target demographic * I used this product for the first time while on spring break- so my skin been dormant the last 5-6 months.

196,beekman 1802,hello sunshine spf 50 pa ++++,pimprod2045017,2624005," * I was probably 50 before I learned that sunscreen is an important part of skincare. Being richly melanated, I took my natural protection for granted (think MAC NW45). But when I started to notice fine lines on my forehead, thanks to my sunroof that is always open, I began to realize even I need sunscreen. I have tried different ones over the years, all with great qualities. But for me, I need a specific combination - high protection, no white cast and very hydrating and moisturizing for my dry/mature slightly sensitive skin. Beekman has been on my radar recently, and I gave their better aging line a try. I'm loving it! This was the next try, and I love it! It's more protective than my beloved SPF 30 sunscreen that shall always remain in rotation, but just as dewy and hydrating, maybe more so. (I keep that one in my purse as a hand cream and backup.) SPF 50! and more pluses than I've ever seen! PA++++! I'm just a couple of weeks in and I'm loving the feel and the protection. I usually wear over my favorite essences and serums, including my vitamin C serum. Sometimes with or without moisturizer underneath. And always on my hands and wrists too, ladies! Lovely on my face, neck and decollette. It's a generous size too. So many facial sunscreens are only 2 oz, some even less. This one is a generous 5 oz. It's a big tube, and it will last a long time. Loving it! * It hydrates my skin well✨️ and it doesn't flake. I wear it everyday and twice a day if im outdoors. I wish they had travel size for small bags/hipbags. * Wouldn't buy it again for my skin I got a reaction towards it where my face broke out even though it feel smooth I noticed my face but getting little bumps that I didn't have before. * ""I was excited to try the Beekman 1802 Hello Sunshine SPF 50, and I love the texture—it feels great on the skin and layers well under makeup, giving a nice glowy finish. The sun protection is solid too, but unfortunately, the 10% octocrylene in the formula makes my eyes teary and uncomfortable. I really wanted to love this sunscreen, but due to the irritation, I have to return it. If you have sensitive eyes, be cautious. Otherwise, it's a good product for sun protection and a radiant look. * I love how well this absorbs and it has no white cast. It also helps in reducing wrinkles and prevents accelerated aging. It's a win win! This non greasy, lightweight formula works great on my sensitive skin. This is also reef safe, sweat & water resistant & super hydrating. I received this free for my honest opinion and am posting here with no obligation. * Beekman 1802 Hello Sunshine SPF 50 PA ++++ is a clinically proven sunscreen for face and body with goat milk and chebula fruit to protect against accelerated aging. Provides daily defense with SPF 50 and the highest PA rating to reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles and prevent future sun damage. I love this sunscreen, it's my go to, the thing I can't live without, and my everyday sunscreen! We all know how important it is to use sunscreen and this is the only one I've found that just melts into your skin! No flakes! No clumps! I would absolutely. recommend this product to everyone because sunscreen is so important for healthy and protected skin. * This sunscreen Is FINALLY what I've been looking for. I am super senstive, dry, acne prone skin and the fact I can put tbis one and not have ANY skin flushing, tingling, or irritation makes me so happy! I put this on everywhere and it does not make my eyes sting or water, YAY! 

I love how lightwieght it is and just seems to blend into the skin immediately. It really feels more like a regular moisturizer that has sunscreen than a suncreen with moisture. 

As an esthetician, this will definitely be what i recommend to my clients!"
197,kinship,self reflect sport sunscreen spf 60,pimprod2031257,2593029," * Finally a high quality mineral spf that works for my dry skin. I live in hot humid Tampa Florida and I wanted to switch to a mineral based spf. This is an excellent product that I've repurchased 10 times now and will continue to repurchase. Great! * I do not know what magic they put in this, but they cracked the code. I am a medium skinned black woman and there is no white caste, even after working out for an hour! Also, it is so comfortable, it does not feel like you are wearing anything AND it is very moisturizing.  I could not stop touching my face. 
This version is better than the non sweatproof version and the best mineral sunscreen I have ever tried, and I have tried a lot. * This is perfect for your outdoor activities--high SPF , water/sweat resistant with very minimal white cast for a zinc-only sunscreen at that high SPF (give it a little time for the slight white to dissipate-note however that i am fairly pale). I also use this on my neck and chest for everyday wear because it doesnt get ""orange"" tint on my collars and 
clothing like my everyday tinted spf does. It feels moisturizing in the skin. It is very different from kinships spf 30 product although I Highly recommend you try both!! * first one suits my sensitive skin, no more irritation and watery eyes due to sunscreen * I love the other Kinship SPF so I thought I'd give this one a try since it's ""water resistant"" and SPF60. I don't see HOW this is water resistant because it never sets and its continuously greasy, on top of that my skin STILL managed to dry out two hours after I've applied it. It rubs off into everything and if you touch your face at any point in the day (I've worn it for 6+ hours) it moves and gets into everything. I've almost finished the whole tube thinking maybe it's user error... it could still possibly be the case. I'm 30 with rosacea, combination dry skin with hormonal breaks out and a thyroid condition that tends to dry my skin and hair out.. I wanted to like this sunscreen but it's a big no. I can't make it work, I've tried it alone, with moisturizer, under makeup, with serum only. I don't feel protected when I wear this sunscreen. It's also got this iridescence to it that at first I thought I would like but it just makes you look like *shiny* vampire. * After using the kinship self reflect spf 30 for several months, this sunscreen is definately my preference over the self reflect. This sunscreen has a very natural satin finish and is very hyrdating without being greasy, while the self reflect spf 30 has a dewy finish and is more lightweight. It takes about 5 minute after application for it to absorb and the cast to disappear. The long term benefits for my very sensitive combo skin have been amazing. The keratosis bumps on my cheeks have completely disappeared and this is the only product I have change in my routine. It has a very subtle vanilla scent that disapears shortly after application. Also the cast is hardly noticable on pale-medium skin. My friend with dark skin borrowed some and said that even though there was a slight white cast for her, it was surprisingly subtle given how high spf it is. This sunscreen has replaced my foundation at this point because  texture of my skin has improved so much since using it. I wish kinship made a body sunscreen like this. Kinship is a solid clean skincare brand and most of my products are from kinship since they are only of the few brands that cause irritation for me. If you have sensitive combo skin I would especially recommend this brand. * After using the kinship self reflect spf 30 for several months, this sunscreen is definately my preference over the self reflect.

After using it for just one week,1 have been not using my regular make up but only this sunscreen moisturizer during the day. My skin looks great with no makeup.
It is great to have a SPF that works like skincare in my routine and is helping with the anti aging process to boot. I am definitely going to be using this all year because UV rays are always out and we need to be protected. Thanks for another great product I am a huge fan of this product too.
Product was received as part of an educational promotion. * This doesn't blend into the skin, but rather sits in top and leaves a white cast. If you touch it or try to put anything over it, get ready for major pillong. Youll have to wipe it all off and start over. I also tried mixing it with another sunscreen, bit it still pilled.  Maybe a bit of oil in this product would help?? * Ive got real sensitive and acne prone skin. So any new product I introduce to my face, my skin will let me know it doesn't like it by breaking me out instantly. Usually by the next morning. I could not find a sunscreen that didn't do this. This one didn't! * Did not like this at all. It was okay at first, although sticky, it seemed fine. The white cast wasnt too baf and it eventually went away. After about 6 hrs i had to wash it off bc my skin was getting extremely red, itchy, and dry. I have oily and acne prone skin that i dont consider sensitive. It took a week for my skin to go back to normal and im still recovering from ghe breakouts. * Love how matte my skin looks. It hasn't made me break out unlike other sunscreens. * Very disappointing for a claim won't cause breakouts. Immediately caused breakouts and congestion. Also very drying cracking skin around nose. I have combo skin"

202,peter thomas roth,max clear invisible priming sunscreen broad spectrum spf 45,pimprod2029956,2579753," * I love this product. It moisturizes my skin and i can lather it on when I'm not wearing makeup. It makes my skin look so healthy. I've turned on 4 of my family members and a handful of friends to this. * The texture is oily and my makeup does not sit well over it. But the worst part about this item is that it smells terrible! * I didn't like the texture and it was grossly oily * I've tried many primers with SPF, and this is my favorite as it actually blurs pores the most and has the highest SPF. It's my daily primer. * I liked this spf until it reached the end. The bottle was very hard to swueeze. I was about to throw it out and decided to cut the package. There was still anton of product left! * It works very well under my makeup and makes my skin look younger. I will definitely buy this product again. * Really nice ,smooth sunscreen. Blends well with my skin with no white cast."
203,l'orÃ©al,bright reveal broad spectrum spf 50 daily uv,pimprod2040389,2613666," * This sunscreen pills once it dries down. It was really disappointed that it didn't have a smooth dry finish. I will not be buying again. * I really wanted to love this sunscreen, but I unfortunately, had a bad reaction to it.  It spread very easily and absorbed quickly, but a few hours later, my cheeks would turn bright red.  I stopped using it and started again and it would start.  It does blend very easily, so I think it's a shame it didn't work out for me. I know that the ingredients don't list anything that would have a strong alcoholic smell, but I thought the sunscreen smelled pretty strongly. * It's glowy and I'll give it that but I did not enjoy this sunscreen at all besides that. It has a strong sunscreen smell. It pills so bad. It also leaves a greasy feeling on me even in the winter time and I have combo/dry skin in the winter. * As a dark skin black woman I have struggled to find sunscreen that works for my skin. So glad I came across this holy grail. No white cast amd gives my skin a cute glow when worn alone. Perfect under makeup as well. This is the only sunscreen I will wear * I really wanted to love this sunscreen as I've heard great things about it both alone and under makeup. Unfortunately it never absorbs and pills terribly, under makeup and on its own. Leaves a whitecast as well. I returned it. * I decided to buy this sunscreen after reading the reviews and decided to give it a try. But I have nothing else to say except bad things about it. I have normal to dry skin, so I thought this would be a good fit for me since it's hydrating. However, it peels off instantly and don't even think to wear it under makeup. Plus, it leaves a white cast every time I apply it. I'm pale white. This is a big regret for me. * If you have olive undertones or tan skin in general this is not for you. The white cast is horrible and this sunscreen does not blend well at all. Made me extremely greasy and peely."
204,live tinted,hyperpigmentation essentials glow up set,pimprod2039104,2609978," * Ive been hearing more and more about this brand particularly the color corrector. I'm glad I got the to sample because i like uneben skin stick, ive been using it for abkjt three weeks and my dar spots on my face and chest ate fading, the tinyed moisturizer worh Spf 20 is ok, but i cant get behind the color corrector. Maybe I'm not patient, or care to take the time to really blend it. Its red, and if you dont take the time for it to set, then build with conceiler then its not going to look good. Im gonna stick with my other fave on that one! I will however, continue to use the dark spot stick! * The orange lip color looks awful. * Happy trial sizes exist of this product. Hyperpigmentation stick was good, glides and blends easily. However no match for my perimenopause dry skin. On anyone else would probably be a moisturizing glow. The SPF was great, blends in and gives a cc type of glow finish. * The tinted sunscreen does leave a slight cast, the color stick is perfect, and the hyperpigmentation serum needs better packaging because you have to dig out the product at end. Overall good value, but wont be purchasing full size items."
205,mad hippie,hydrating facial spf 25+,pimprod2025059,2581557," * I got this in a sample size & absolutely loved it. I'm oil prone & put it on in the morning - it's kept my face matte all day. Definitely need to get this in a full size. * My skin is fair and acne prone. This sunscreen has been working great so far. I actually have not noticed any new breakouts during the past couple of weeks I've been using this product. I even put it on my arm tattoos. The scent is pleasant, which is great because I hate the smell of sunscreen. Overall I think it's a great daily sunscreen for your face. * to start, spf 25 isnt even enough for your face or body no matter how much you use. I personally have combo skin with dry cheeks and an oily t zone, and this product dries me out! it sits TERRIBLY under makeup, and sweats off too easily. will not be re purchasing. * I bought the sunscreen because I've been on the hunt for a daily mineral 'clean ingredient' face SPF. I previously purchased the Mad Hippie face serum with spf and liked it, but saw this and there was more product for a similar price so I figured I'd give it a go. It is very light and blends easily for a mineral sunscreen, leaving a minimal cast (if at all). It has a very light, negligible scent. I don't wear daily makeup so I can't speak to layering it with other products, but I really like this sunscreen so far. * I didnt fond myself reaching for it a lot. Ive been trying to experiment with mineral sunscreens and while I think this did the job fine, it was very had to warm up in my hanfs out for me, and seemed greasy. 

I feel like this would be the ideal sunscreen for winter with ifs moisturizing properties, but not for summer, at least for me. * Even the smallest amount has left a white cast and flakes. I got a huge zit almost immediately after applying. Will be returning! * I love Mad Hippie but this is not my favorite product so far. It runs in clear but leaves your fingers feeling sticky afterwards."
206,zitsticka,megashade breakout-proof spf 50 serum,pimprod2025207,2584617," * I use this daily for my neck and chest. I am extremely break out prone and this is the one product that I can use daily ans not aggrivate any body acne. Its lightweight, yes hydrating and I dont mind the packaging. 
Its a little pricey but to know it wont break me out its worth the peace of mind! * Let me start off saying I live in AZ so sunscreen is a must, and I hardly ever buy the same product twice. This sunscreen has been repurchased 4 times now. It's perfect, its light weight feeling, hydrating, and I love the new packaging (even with the old dropper packaging, I hated that but the product was so good I continued to buy it, but the new pump is the best). It never makes my skin break out, I love that it's spf 50 as I wont use anything less than 40. Makeup goes on over it nicely, never had any issues with separation (skin is usually dry but sometimes oily nose area).
For people saying it's overpriced, I don't think it is. It has alot of skincare benefits besides sun protection, and if you have crazy sensitive skin that breaks out from almost everything (like I do) and you're on a clear skin journey, this is worth it. I'm a firm believer that if the product actually works then I will pay the price. I will continue to purchase this for as long as it's around, hopefully forever! * Ive tried countless sunscreens and this is my absolute favorite ever im obsessed. I have sensitive skin and this is the only one that works for me * Overpriced. * For the price, i expected much better quality. * I love this spf so much! Its lightweight and perfect if you are acne prone. Its leaves a dewy finish that can be set with powder if thats not your vibe. No whitecast on my pale skin is visible. It feels nice to apply! Doesnt smell awful or all. Ive gone through 3 bottles of this about to purchase my 4th. Its so good, try it at least once in your spf journey, i dont think youll be disappointed. * This sunscreen has changed my life! It is the only one that i have wanted to put on my face every single day! It has never made me break out and it makes makeup go on so smooth! Especially under the eyes! Please never stop making this! It is my holy grail sunscreen!!!!"
207,vichy,liftactiv peptide-c face sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2013305,2559388," * I am like that this has vitamin C and sunscreen. The lotion goes on easily, but it smells so bad. I will be returning it. * Does not leave white cast, wears good under makeup, I have been using for years now! * Terrible strong perfume scent that caused a rash - will be returning * It is light and smooth, not greasy. It will run into your eyes if you sweat. It has a strong fragrance like men's cologne. I don't know if it is a signature Vichy scent or what, but it is not a fragrance that plays well with others. * My skin is somewhat sensitive. Not many products, including sunscreen, break me out, but the ones that do, REALLY mess me up. This sunscreen broke me out terribly. Not all over the face, but a few cystic blemishes, including one of my nose. I'm still dealing with the scarring from that :( The scent on this is VERY strong. I am not sensitive to scents at all. I don't care when products are scented, but there is no need for it be this strongly scented. What were they thinking? 

I bought this during the beauty days sale so I will keep it and use it on my neck and chest for the anti-aging benefits, but if you are breakout prone from sunscreens, be very careful with this one. * My first time trying out this face sunscreen and it feels nothing like all the others I've tried and used under makeup! This is veil like, smooth application…. BUT!!! The scent! The scent is STRONG and it does not go away even after you applying foundation or bb cream… I really wanted to love this product because of the peptides but im disappointed I will not be using it as I wanted due to the smell. Side note the description does indicate there is a floral scent to it (i missed reading that part) I agree it is a floral scent except it is strong! * I like how this goes on and the potential benefits, however, it irritates my rosacea and makes me redder."
208,kopari beauty,antioxidant face shield mineral spf 30,pimprod2031646,2594644," * This gave me no sun protection, skin rash and is not a true Mineral Sunscreen. It has butyloctyl salicylate  a UV filter Chemical. It burns my skin, eyes and neck. I do not recommend for sensitive or need a mineral sunscreen. what a waste of money. disappointed. * I use this sunscreen almost daily, I love that it's mineral based and has clean ingredients. It does have an odd light smell but I would rather deal with that than put something with a strong parfum/fragrance ingredient on my face. It makes my skin glowy and dewy which I love! * I really wanted to like this one, but it's not for me. It has an off putting smell and is greasy so your makeup slides off. Using sunscreen daily is the key to keeping skin young looking. To get the best protection I think the easiest and best is the mists or setting sprays like seriously fab zinc over. If sunscreen is greasy and smells bad, you're probably not gonna wanna do it every day. This one has a long list of chemicals no bueno. * I really wanted to like this but don't understand the hype. It smells terrible, like sand and playdough somehow at the same time. It's not glowy but greasy and doesn't ever dry down, making you feel sticky for hours. The greasiness means makeup also doesn't wear well on top. I tried it for a long time to give it a fair chance (about 1 month) and ended up throwing the rest away. Do not recommend. * This product has an odor that is so horrible, I had to wash my face after application. * I have purchased this product, three times sense trying it… it is a little expensive, but it doesn't break me out, smells good, and it looks beautiful on the skin. * I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to most sunscreens but I can sometimes pull off mineral. This was a winner. The only down side is the smell but worth the 5 seconds."
209,vichy,capital soleil tinted face mineral sunscreen spf 60,pimprod2013306,2559390," * Not my favorite sunscreen on the market but I like the fact that its SPF 60, bottle is small so travels well and consistency is fine. When I apply this with my hands, it leaves me with a like chalky/pale, no white, but pale skintone which you dont expect for a tinted product.  I prefer to apply with a makeup brush. The thing I dislike most is the smell, reminds me of sulfur, using a brush minimized that. Likely won't repurchase and will just use what I have left. * I really wanted to like this sunscreen. It dries down matte but it breaks me out everytime I use it. * I like to use mineral sunscreens because they don't sting my eyes, but this one stings my entire face. * It balls up, pills and comes off EVERY SINGLE TIME.
I shake it until the cows come home
I use just ONE moisturizer underneath it
I put it on NAKED skin

It PILLS, without fail * this is my new foundation. 2 in 1 for sure. I am going for a second bottle. * I've used heavy full coverage foundations for almost 20 years. I wanted to add sunscreen and skincare to my makeup. tried several tinted serums, sunscreens, moisturizers, but this one actually has some coverage and gives you a glow. I stopped wearing foundation completely now. this is my daily go to. if I need extra coverage I use a little concealer. I still do my smoky eye and it looks great * Product is definitely oily and even after shaking VERY well, it was still separating and had almost sandlike grains in it. Additionally it was not blendable at all and made my lightly tanned skin look ghostly. Am returning asap."
210,first aid beauty,mineral sunscreen zinc oxide broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2032660,2593738," * I love this product so much! Ive been looking for a sunblock for years. I've tried blue lizard, cetaphil, la roche posay, it, elf, & supergoop. They've all irritated my skin. This is the first sunblock that has not irritated my face. I'm so glad i invested in it. The product is a little sticky, but i dont mind! * Sunscreen is something I've incorporated into my daily skin regimen since I was a tween. This sunscreen goes on sheer and has a subtle non bothering natural fragrance that makes application enjoyable. * I have very oily and acne prone skin, this product saved my skin. I have yet to break out. The bottle also lasts forever, I've had the same bottle for 6 months. Love this product, worth the price. * Recommend to those with sensitive skin as it's a mineral sunscreen. Zinc is good for acne and I didn't break out from this. I dont recommend this for those with darker skin as it may leave a white cast * Not sure how this has so many postive reviews. Its so sticky and tacky. I would not recomend this. * I just jeep coming back too it. I have combo sensative acne prone skin and its just unbeatable! * doesnt leave a white cast, didnt break me out, protexts my skin from the sun, sits well under makeup, feels like a moisturizer, dosesnt pill. this is the beat spf ive ever used and ive been looking for one for so long"
211,kiehl's since 1851,super fluid daily uv defense spf 50+,pimprod2002969,2536726," * I have greasy, combo, acne prone, olive toned skin and now use this every day. It feels really great on the skin and does not clog my pores. * It is second time to me to use it because I love it and it's perfect on my skin!! * when it comes to sunblock I want to cringe at the price but it works SO WELL and my skin doesn't break out AT ALL when using this.
I know I'll be rebuying it once I run out. * Again - poorly packaged; leaked all over the very small bottle.  Over priced for the amount. * Don't like this product. If u sweat it will burn and irritate your eyes. * I have several Kiehl's products, I am in love with this brand and have the best skin I've had in a long time. Some things I deal w/ are being acne-prone, oily, rosacea and very sensitive. I've been doing some research on rosacea and have read that wearing a daily SPF can help with redness (among many other benefits, of course). I wanted to make sure I was getting a product from a brand I believe in because face sunscreen has been tricky for me. It's usually greasy and breaks me out significantly. I spent the extra money for this product and am unfortunately not very pleased. Like other comments, this product does ball up on the face. I find that I have to let my daily moisturizer sink in for AT LEAST 10 minutes before I can put on my sunscreen. And the more you try to massage it into the face, the more it will ball up. Other than that, my MAJOR complaint about this product is that after applying and about an hour after it's on my face, my skin starts to burn. It feels as though I have a mild sunburn across my entire face where you can feel the discomfort and burn. Again, I have sensitive skin and apparently it's just not reacting well with me. I've gone a few days without it and then tried it again and it is 100% this sunscreen. I'm out side of my return time so I'm stuck with it and really disappointed. I hate having to purchase products to figure out what works for my skin. Just writing this in-depth review for those of you with the same kind of skin as me...just to think twice. I will say, it does eventually sink into my skin and does not leave it greasy so that's a positive. * Since it is new to me, I am still trying to learn the right amount to apply. Too much (first try) and I had to blot it to make it just right. Second day, it was fine. It does not leave a white cast, definitely a pro. For its high quality, the price is reasonable!"
212,clinique,broad spectrum spf 50 sunscreen body cream,pimprod2037471,2604492," * I have gone on outdoors and swimming. It never disappoints when it's body protection. Against let's say, Neutrogena spray-on SPF, I got sunburned on the areas where I used the latter one, and the Clinique SPF protected areas remained unharmed."
213,australian gold,botanical tinted face sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2012275,2615515," * I liked this, it went on great, flet good, and dried matte which was great for me cause im a oily girly but as a black woman it does leave a heavy white cast, like black makeup in the 90's/ casket ready type of white cast which is a no no for me, and it was obvious if i didnt rub it into my hair line which is why the rating is so low. So unless you like that kind of look I wouldn't suggest it for my brown and black girl, boys, gays or theys. * Such a nice sheer tint, blends easily. definitely get this!!!! * My skin is sensitive and acne-prone so it's oftentimes challenging for me to find an spf that works. I absolutely love this spf tint - it looks natural on my skin, doesn't break me out, and it provides good sun protection. Please bring back all three shades of this! I miss being able to purchase it from here * Im a chemical sunscreen girl, but I kept seeing this sunscreen on social media so I decided go give it a try. 

PROS: 
- whipped texture 
- neutral tones 
- matte finish 
- absorbs oil
- good around the eye area 
- great for oily skin and/or summer
- 50+ SPF
- great for an active lifestyle

CONS: 
- feels a little heavy until it sets 

I do two layers of sunscreen: first a chemical sunscreen and then a mineral sunscreen. This is the best mineral sunscreen I've tried (Neutrogena, Cerave, MDSolarSciences, DMTLGY). * It's REALLY good, just not for someone with dry skin. I do like the texture, coverage, natural looking color, and the overall matte apperance but after 30 minutes it dries me out so bad. It would be good for humid days/someone with ""normal"" skin. * Over all good but very prone to rub off on clothing. Can't use near v neck and don't pull a top over your head. * The title says it all.  I purchased this, very excited to have found a sunscreen that is spf 50 and tinted AND acne safe.  Read some reviews saying it was not good at all, etc, great for oily skin.  This is why I was happily surpised that on my fair, dry skin it felt and looked great.  It was a little bit dark for my skin but it just made me look bronzed there wasn't any harshness or orange.  And it felt good on my skin under makeup (concealer and powder) all day.  Very suprised it also did not transfer.  Overall great product but I am suspicious of how it is spf 50 when the active ingredients do not indicate this at all."
214,dime,wonderscreen broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2035158,2603227," * I have truly enjoyed Dime's other products and had hoped that the sunscreen would work as well as the rest of the line. I was instead disappointed with the sunscreen.  The texture was smooth, no string smells, but it refused to blend into my skin.  I have tried numerous times but ended up looking like a vanilla frosted donut face.  Or worse, when I thought it was blended only to see my reflection later and see the white cast. * I am quite disappointed with this product. It is very expensive and I expected more from it. Also reviews from other people somehow made me think this would be some kind of holy grail. I have rosacea and red bumps on my skin. On the very first day I applied this to my face, I noticed that the skin started to flake and become drier than ever, as well as a tingling sensation. Maybe I just can't tolerate the mineral sunscreens, I'm not sure, but I expected more for this price. * Does what is supposed to, but the white cast is insane! Feels super heavy and oily on my dry skin and it peels when appliyng makeup. * It is now 2024 and we still have physical sunscreens that give darker skin women a white cast. The 12 dollar Neutrogena sunscreen will give you the same results. Save your money. * Another physical sunscreen that pictures black women but then isn't inclusive. It still gives whitecast on brown skin. Disappointed. * For me personally I found it to be watery and made my face look pasty white. Just like the kind you would get from normal skinscreen. Granted it does smell good and does the job of protecting my skin. * This spf is so lightweight and easy to wear under makeup. I have very oily skin and for a change a spf lotion didn't make it worse. I can't recommend this enough"
215,black girl sunscreen,kids spray & play spf 50 sunscreen,pimprod2038242,2609780," * I absolutely love this product, whenever i start to run low on product i go and get two more bottles lol. Love the spf 50, leaves my skin shiny and glistening, and easy to apply. * This product has a strong odor which I really don't like. No white cast though. I prefer the BGS kids version and probably won't purchase this again. * The sunscreen itself isnt bad but it only lasted me two days. * I wanted to love this more. When I sprayed it on my face, the product seeped into my eyes and burned the rest of the night. If I spray it on my hands and apply it that way, I love how it sits on my skin. Nice glow but heavy fragrance."
216,avÃ¨ne,mineral sunscreen broad spectrum spf 50 face and body lotion,pimprod2039988,2611198," * I love this! For a completely mineral sunscreen with no tint, I'm super impressed. This is a great moisturizer and can totally be used as a single step. It does have a waxy sort of smell to it when you first apply but it doesn't linger- if you're someone who has to use all fragrance-free products because of eczema you probably already know exactly whatp I'm talking about. But again, the smell doesn't linger, it completely disappears.

There is also a pretty strong white cast when you first apply, but after rubbing it in well and waiting for it to absorb (you should be waiting ~20 mins after applying sunscreen before you go outside anyway!) it completely disappears on my brown skin. (I'm about the skin tone of Parveen Kaur for reference lol.) I only use it on my body though, for two reasons: 1) I prefer tinted minerals on my face to help with hyperpigmentation, and 2) white casts are always more noticeable on the face in my opinion. But if I try it on my face I will report back!

Overall, I find this super moisturizing and great for winter dryness and/or eczema prone skin. I like to apply it on my arms and legs, even in the winter when I'm covered up. Feels thick and soothing and leaves my skin soft. If you like a lightweight sunscreen that doesn't feel like body lotion, this is NOT for you. Especially in a humid climate, this might be too much. I also can't speak to the white cast for someone with a deeper skintone than mine. But for my skin type (brown, dry and sensitive, lifelong eczema, braving the new england winter😭), I really love this! * I am not one who is harsh on products and always give them the benefit of the doubt, but this one had an overpowering smell! I do not mind a heavy fragrance but this one was not pleasant. I would absolutely purchase again if there was a way to tone down those scents some! I did some reasearch and some people mentioned that it may be a scent from the minerals causing a weird smell rather than adding fragrance which can cause a reaction in some people. Who knows, but I do know I hold my breath everytime I put it on! :( * This has the least amount of whitecast of any mineral sunscreen ive tried and is one of the highest SPFs I have seen. The smell is not pleasent. But it goes away after a bit. I have asked my bf and he cannot smell it on my skin after the inital application. * This sunscreen is too white, has a scent to it its not bad but not for me im sure theres better sunscreens * I had buy this same product but it had a different packaging(it used to be orange) i loved it back then, because it keept my skin hydrated(super good for dry skin). 
This time the smell and consistency of formulation is way different, too liquidy, and i can learn to work with that… but the smell, it's just awful, i thought it was caducated but nope… 
If they could only take that smell away i would love this again! * I'm not sure how they can market it as ""not greasy"" when even after an hour of application it is still quite greasy on the face and body. That being said, it does a great job protecting from burning and tanning, and despite it's greasiness it's held up for many hours in sweltering heat and humidity. I wore a thick layer to the theme park, set it on the face with SPF powder, and throughout the day dabbed the sweat off with face tissue. No burns or tanning. Not an everyday wear SPF but good for when you expect to be out in the heat/sun for a time. * White cast on face :/ This is not for melanin skin at all. Im olive/medium tan, kund of like jessica albas skin tone, im not even that dark and this left a obvious white cast, my face had that purple hue, I looked awful. and the consistency is very thick, goopy and sticky and had this weird smell. I guess this would be fine to use for the body if you are not easily bothered by consistency or smell
. I prefer a sunscreen that feels like its not there"
217,bliss,block star sheer liquid daily sunscreen spf 50,pimprod2038458,2607974," * this formula is now my new favorite.  I love their tube tinted version in spf30, but this one knocks it out of the park.  it is runny, smooth, not greasy, blends well.  it's everything I. looking for in a sunscreen including the 20% zinc! * This is one of my favorite sunscreens, I'm very fair and the white cast really evens out my skin, it looks like I am wearing a tinted moisturizer. If you're super pale and in the market for a tinted moisturizer or sunscreen, I cannot recommend this enough! * I'm actually a fan of other Bliss products, but I have never experienced a whiter cast from sunscreen in my life. I could tell it would have one as it came out of the bottle, but wanted to trust the ""sheer"" claims. Will be returning. * I really like the light weight feel of this sunscreen, espeically for a mineral one. Although I find it pills under makeup and can cling to dry spots. So best for a no makeup day. * Iv tried a lot of sunscreens and I mean alot . Every single sunscreen I have used breaks me out even mineral ones. This sunscreen is by far the best one iv ever used its just amazing . * This sunscreen is so good. I've tried so many sunscreens and this one has everything I want. It actually absorbs, no white cast, it doesn't get into my eyes, and it's recyclable. * I need to stick to mineral sunscreens for my skin, so it's been hard for me to find one that leaves a minimal white cast, has high SPF, and is water-resistant. I just finished my first bottle of this, and so far I think it's one of the better ones I've tried! It doesn't irritate my skin, blends impressively for SPF 50, and doesn't feel heavy at all.

I have tan skin, so I usually wear a BB cream over this to cancel out the slight white cast this leaves. Note that it's a high SPF, untinted *mineral* sunscteen, so I cannot expect it to be fully clear. 

The one downside is that this seems to turn white in areas that get wet or have a lot of friction, such as under the bridge of your glasses. It can be rubbed back in very easily, but that's something to note."
218,mad hippie,luminizing facial spf 29,pimprod2030862,2592480," * One of the worst sunscreens I have used. It leaves a very heavy greasy feeling on your face and good luck if it gets into your eyes! They will burn and itch for hours. I love their serums but not this. Will be returning asap. * love this sunscreen, my only ick with it is that if i wear makeup over this it tends to make it peel :(. i usually use another spf bb cream as my foundation over this, so maybe ill just try their tinted foundations instead. * I was excited about this susncreen because I use other Mad Hippie products. However, I only used it for a week as I noticed my skin became super dry while I was using this and my pores were so clogged even when I exfoliated. I also started getting little bumps on my face and redness. There was also residue when I applied makeup on top. * I like this SPF a lot. You do need to rub it in quite a bit, but I like the glowy effect and that it has clean ingredients. I definitely recommend! * It's lightweight, not greasy, dries quickly and looks great. I love the ingredients and price :) * Not one to go out of my way to write a bad review but this product caused some kind of allergic reaction. Used it just once and started itching on neck. Spread to a rash everywhere I put product. Still dealing with eczema leather skin type of rash * I like how it feels on the skin but it dries down very quickly which means that you cannot put it on in sections, you have to apply to your whole face at the same time or it will pill on the face which is annoying"

It's lightweight and not greasy and definitely gives u a cute glow. * so far so good. * I tried this sunscreen on a whim since I'm already such a fan of this brand and I'm SO pleased! My husband and I used this for the first time for a full day of walking around the zoo and we only had to reapply twice. No burns/pinkness and no residue. * I am obsessed with this sunscreen to say the absolute least! I honestly use it every day as a body lotion because it gives the most beautiful shine without being greasy. It makes my skin look so healthy. It, of course, also serves its purpose as a sunscreen. Please please PLEASE never discontinue this!!! * I love this stuff. It smells great and it works very well. But as an outdoor concert girlie, I'm begging for a miniature version so I can carry it in a small bag"

But the chemical scent is so strong, If even put the product up to my face, my eyes sting and water. It also pills into little balls when your rub it in. I havne't gotten burned when I wear it so it does protect my skin- & I'm finishing the bottle because I don't want to waste it. But I would not buy it again. * Feels and smells like a sanitizer. 
Not comfortable puting this on my littles ones. * This stuff has a very strong alcohol smell and mixed with the banana it's almost too much. That being said, I really like how this applies on wet skin. Will continue to use for reapplication purposes only"

It also didn't want to blend into my skin 100%, peeled off away from my face (bare) in flakes. I looked like I had white eraser dust on my face. Same thing for my friend. * I have tried sooo many mineral sunscreens and they end up either having a white cast, feel heavy and gross, look too oily, or dry out my already dry skin. I am allergic to chemical sunscreen so im limited on what I can use. Let me just tell you … this sunscreen is IT. It is so lightweight and feels like i am just putting on a lightweight moisturizer. It absorbs fast and the finish looks ""natural"" and not dewy or shiny. No white cast, rubs in easily, and wears well under makeup. I run outside in the sun for 2 + hrs and never get burnt. Cant say enough good things about this sunscreen. * Look - this pills.  I really was hoping this would be a great, sheer, water resistant, mineral option for the summer.  However, if you use more than a smidge, this pills.  I tried on bare skin, over just a toner, under my full normal morning skin routine and it pills on application.  The texture is nice and not drying, and the cast is minimal, but present,  in comparison to many other mineral sunscreens.  I am aggressively neutral on the smell, its a little sunscreen-y, but it doesnt bother me.. Its neither strong, nor long lasting.  Also, its not a great amount.  I plan to use this up on my hands and ears. * I have mixed feelings about this sunscreen. One the one hand it dries down quickly and isnt sticky which I really appreicate. On the other hand it pills around my chin, neck, and eyebrows…which isnt the worst thing but is a little annoying. I mostly use this sunscreen on days where I need to run out of the house and need something that dries down quickly. * I love this sunscreen! As the name suggests it is very sheer and leaves my skin feeling moisturized without feeling sticky or greasy (a big ask for my oily skin). I will say, it does pill up under makeup if you start immediately after applying, but I give it 10 minutes or so and you should have no problem! * I used to use Biossance squalane mineral sunscreen until people started having reactions and it was pulled off the market. In my search for a comparable sunscreen, I found this one and honestly I think I like it even more! Feels very lightweight and moisturizing and blends in well! I like the glow it gives but I don't think it makes me look oily (I have combo-dry skin).My only wish is if they could make an SPF 50+ version!"

Other reviews in 2023 showed pictures of the products expiring in 2025. Disappointed and will be returning. * Really wanted to like these. They go on smooth but them almost immediately start pilling. They do not play well with makeup, even a BB cream."

It's way too dark for me so I've wasted the money now. I love Pacifica but this was very disappointing. * I bought this with high hopes because I love Pacifica products. I will not purchase again. this is so thick and sticky I can't bring myself to use it. It absorbs almost too quickly, is hard to blend and so thick I couldn't wait to wash my hands after using it. I've tried shaking it to mix it (it does tell you to shake well) but nothing moves in the bottle when you shake it. The only nice thing about it is the bottle. * You have changes the recipe?!?!? 
Its not the same. I used to love this product. 
Now its just ok  - it is sticky. 
Will not but again. * Tried this product bc it was on sale. For a zinc oxide mineral based SPF, this tinted moisturizer feels very light on the face. Not as light as a chemical SPF moisturizer such as a Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, but it's a mineral SPF so it sits as a physical UV barrier like mineral sunscreen does. 

No white cast with this mineral SPF bc it's lightly tinted. I was surprised as others bc it's not apparent on the packaging except for one small info graphic on the side that it's tinted. But I imagine that's how they got around it having a white cast residue. I have extremely light skin with reddish hair and using two pea-sized product amount left no discernible cast once it soaked in over a few minutes. 

The scent is akin to bubblegum or cotton candy but thankfully does not last once it's dried. I really like that it's a light weight mineral tinted moisturizer, but simply based on the overly sweet scent I probably won't buy this product again. I need a mid30s formulation of this product not the teens formulation this product feels like it's geared towards :P * I had no idea it was tinted. Nothing (at least prominent) on the packaging that indicates it's tinted. When I squeezed it out, it's orange. Looks absolutely terrible. Not a glowy tan. Rather the color of a former POTUS. * I didn't like the consistency or tint * I absolutely love pacifica as a brand and honestly i really like this line too, the cleanser is great. But this sunscreen is a no go for me. Its WAYYYYYY too dark, im naturally very pale but ive tried it both on my usual pale tone and tanned and either way its patchy and dark. It feels extremely heavy and gross on the skin and was a sensory nightmare. It dries super fast so its a pain to blend even if it was a closer shade to me. Spend the extra 20$ and get yourself some supergoop."

Maybe some people can tolerate it on their skin but not mine. * *I was gifted by Supergoop to review* My skin is typically combination, however my biggest concern with sunscreens is 1. Being good with sensitive skin and 2. Having little to no white cast since I have tan skin. To my surprise, there was ZERO white cast, and the lotion is completely white so it went into my skin nicely and left it pretty soft. I would recommend! * I love it. I put it on everyday. It doesn't make my face look oily even if I apply makeup on top. It's a great product that last for hours. I highly recommend this product. I received this product complimentary from Supergoop. * My skin is super itchy now. * Leaves a white cast. I will use the rest of it since it wasnt cheap but if you have medium to dark skin this might not be the sunscreen for you * My daughter love the super goop SPF 30 lotion it doesn't give a white residue. The whole family use it to. * I occasionally use it as a base for my make up and usually the first thing in the morning. If you don't set it with powder, it can get kind of greasy but otherwise it doesn't clog pores or make me break out."

Goes on very smoothly, not shiny, not too thick, does not make my face look white. It blends in very nicely and has even helped reduce the redness on my face. Love it obsessed need more. * couldn't even try this product to see if it was any good because the pump wouldn't dispense any product and it was extremely annoying to try to scoop out the sunscreen with my finger. * This is the one sunscreen that doesn't break me out and it doesn't have a weird smell. I love that it has a pump but only 1 out of the 3 bottles I had gotten had a working pump. The tubing of the pump is too long and kinks up in the container, and I have to scoop it out with my fingers. It sounds like the defective pump is a big issue for many of us. Please fix this Earth Harbor! 

Nerding out-Many sunscreens claim SPF 30- each 1% zinc oxide = 1.6 SPF units. With 18.8% zinc oxide, this is truely SPF 30, protecting against 97% of UVB rays.

I will stay a loyal customer as long as they fix the pump issue 😊 * burns and itches my skin. pump doesn't work. * the sunscreen itself is fine but the pump on mine doesn't work so i have to scoop it out with my finger * Unfortunately, like others have said, I couldn't get the pump to even get any of the product out. I tried multiple times, thinking the product just had to work its way up the pump but, when I opened it, the tube for the pump was so bent around and around that there was no way the product could have made its way up. Additionally, the product is SO thick that I'm not sure how it even could have fit through the tiny tubing. Instead of scooping it all out, I'm planning to return. * Left my face feeling kind of greasy, but the biggest issue is how jacked the bottle is. When I opened it, I couldn't get the pump to work, and removed it to see if I could get it working. The tube leading from the pump into the bottle was bent into a zig-zag, rendering the pump completely useless. Now I have to scoop it out and use the bent tube like a tiny spatula. The moisturizer itself isn't anything special. Not sure I would buy again, especially if they're not cautious during the packing process to make sure the pump will actually work."

The product lays in creases on the face (think wrinkles and eye creases). It has no white caste, which is great. But it is horrible to blend. * Although the color is nice and does not leave a white cast, I immediately had issues with pilling and would not recommend the product because of that. * I find that this product is not moisturizing enough to be labeled as a ""daily mosturizer"". It would be great as an SPF for those who have oily skin, as it gives a smooth matte finish. On my dry skin, it sticks to my dry patches and looks terrible. Even over other moisturizers I am not getting a smooth finish. Just beware if you have dry skin! * It is so hard to distribute on the skin and then leaves a horrible cast. The package said over 80% of users agreed it matched their skin tone which I am assuming was tested on people with white skin. Package is very misleading, do not buy. * This balls and pills so badly even when used alone. Gets worse throughout the day. Do not buy. * Need a mineral sunscreen since skin has been sensitized by tret use, i know physical formulas will never be as cosmetically elegant as chemical, this product is the worst i've ever tried. Separates horribly, clumps on my lips and hairline, strong white cast. * I religiously used the original Ultra Calming moisturizer from Aveeno for over 20 years.  That moisturizer was perfect- amazing texture, good pump packaging, and most importantly it was 100% effective at keeping my redness at bay.
This stuff (which is essentially their replacement to that one) is  garbage.  It's tinted (why?), it has a sticky texture which makes it difficult to blend in, and the packaging is cheap.   On top of all that, it actually has made my redness worse.  Oh!  And it has HALF the amount of the product as the Ultra Calming moisturizer- for a higher price.   Corporate greed trickling down to the consumer does not go unnoticed.  Johnson & Johnson majorly dropped the ball with this new ""Calm and Restore"" line."

I noticed my skin felt way smoother after using as well. I love it and will for sure buy again. * This is my favorite sunscreen. I buy it over and over again. I'm very pale so I can't speak about white cast, but it's not a mineral sunscreen so that shouldn't be a huge problem. It is very hydrating but not oily. It feels like I've just put on a nice moisturizer. It also reapplies very well. It never pills on top of itself. I don't wear foundation so I don't know about wearing it under anything but it does look good under a skin tint or concealer. * Tried this out for a humid, 100 degree full sun TX vacation.

The tube is a little funky but a gentle squeeze as you pump the top and you're good to go. * I've tried pretty much every mineral sunscreen on the market, only to absolutely hate the way it feels and looks on my skin or it burns my sensitive eyes.... BUT this one checks all the boxes!  It doesn't leave a white cast, doesn't feel heavy or burn your eyes and actually feels really nice on the skin, plus leaves a smooth canvas for makeup.  Highly recommend and as long as they continue to make it, I will continue to use this sunscreen product exclusively. * I ordered two tubes (it was on sale!) and the pump on both tubes was defective. I could not get the product out of the tube to try it. I tried many different ways (short of cutting the tube open). I am so disappointed. * The product is fine. The packaging is horrible. No matter how much I pump, nothing comes out. The only way is to get any product is to squeeze the bottle and pump at the same time. * I initally bought this sunscreen because I had a few moles on my face surgically removed, my dermatologist gave me a gel to clear up the scars but it hadn't worked the way I hoped after a few months. My incision sight was still pretty deep and uneven. After only a week of applying this sunscreen both on my face and directly to my scars they faded even more than they previously had with the prescribed gel!!! It works wonders!! Both for general scars and also acne scars or pigmentation. Swear it always clears them up for me overnight. A little goes a long wayyyy. It's also the perfect size for traveling and on the go application. My skin is super soft after too, there are no cons to it. I love it! * Its okay, personally think there is a smell to it and i think its a little strong and i do not like it. It also pills and doesnt feel like my skin really absorbs it. Will finish the bottle but wont repurchase. * I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I bought this several months ago and I gave it a good shot but I can not believe so many people love this.
It's grainy, leaves a horrible white cast even on my very fair skin and just sits on the skin wrong. It doesn't sink in and dries and flakes and leaves white residue all over my clothes and eyebrows and somehow also is horribly greasy all day, and I have no idea why but no matter what I do it spreads and ends up in my eyes after about an hour after applying and it HURTS."

It also works beautifully that we don't burn as fast. Hands down the only sunscreen we take go the beach. * I love it so much I have been using for years!! I love how it makes my skin glowy. I have dry ans slightly oily skin it does not make my skin just hydrated, You must shake the bottle everytime you use it just a heads up. ( I have seen reviews about ""it's oily or it separates"" you have to shake it common sense) but anyways LOVE LOVE 10/10 * I have been using thos sunscreen for a long time. I love it so much. It makes my skin so glowy. * This is very oily sunscreen, it's almost shimmery. It made my face so greasy. This is sunscreen is fine for body use, but I don't recommend it for your face. * I bought the travel size version of this  lotion two weeks ago to take with me on a trip. I've always heard really good things about this brand, and thought I'd give it a try, but unfortunately it's just not for me. I felt like the texture of this product was sticky even after drying and left my face feeling very greasy. I have rosacea and my skin tends to be very reactive to new products. I was hoping this would be different, but it did make my entire face break out pretty badly. The fragrance is much heavier than I would like from a facial sunscreen. The sun protection factor was great, and I will continue to use the rest of the product on my chest/hands/body. If you have dry skin and don't have sensitivity issues like I do, this probably is a great product. * I absolutely love this product!!! Ive been using it for years and its the only thing that doesnt make me get sun burns. I will say its a bit on the oily side but if you plan on tanning or just laying by the pool i dont see a big deal in looking a bit oily . It blends so well with my skin tone i will be buying again * As always, loveee shisiedo sunscreens. This is just like the original, but hey the more SPF, the better. No white cast, no break outs, and my makeup never pills while using this. I see sometimes people worry about wateriness, but that's only happened to me if my bottle was in my bag on a hot day or I forgot to shake it well before squeezing some out."

If you actually apply enough to achieve protection there's a ghostly cast and if you keep rubbing it pills. I hope they rework the formula because thier other products I've tried are amazing. * Blends well. Doesn't crease. Feels moisturizing. The only problem is the color. very warm. May not be good for fair skin.  And the tint will oxidized as it dries. * It doesn't create a cast and is a perfect match for my skin but at the price paid, the packaging is terrible. The product comes out at the seam on the side where the label stops. * As a Latina with brown oily skin type  that likes to try new mineral sunscreens for people of color would totally recommend this sunscreen under makeup. Did not have any issues with pilling and wore beautifully under my matte foundations! * This is a very good sunscreen, but I think they need to take it back to the lab and tweak the formula as it flakes and pills by midday. Because of this, you cannot wear it under foundation otherwise you'll have a big mess on your face. I've been using it for about a year now but I'm currently looking for another brand. I will revisit this product in the future if they ever improve the formula.

Excellent mineral based SPF
Matches my skin perfectly
No white cast
Dries down into a beautiful dewy finish
POC owned
Great price! * I purchased this item when it first came out, and I was very excited to support a black owned brand and have another option for a mineral sunscreen that wouldn't look crazy on darker skin. It does blend in very well, although it still has a slight light cast as any mineral sunscreen is going to. However, I noticed that it would pill throughout the day. I tend to unconsciously rub my face throughout the day, and I would get little bits of sunscreen on my hands. I tried using other products underneath thinking my vitamin c or my moisturizer was the issue, but no matter what combination it always pilled. * I have dry skin and really wanted to try this out but I didn't know it gave a matte finish so I follow it up with a water resistant sunscreen from black girl sunscreen."
236,shiseido,urban environment oil-free mineral sunscreen spf 42,pimprod2038381,2606930," * I received this as part of my sample pack & finally decided to give it a try at the beach & poolside.

I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't cause my skin to breakout & it really stood up to the sun.  I was able to achieve a nice tan, while wearing sunglasses, but didn't get the raccoon eyes.

I normally wear the tinted sunscreens that are just as expensive, but they actually feel greaser & cause my skin to breakout.  I don't mind the shiny look as long as my face doesn't feel greasy.  In fact, it goes on rather light.

I'm going to try tge vitamin c one next.  But am definitely sold on this one. * This has been my go to sunscreen option for years now.
It's light. 
It doesn't irritate the eyes.
It doesn't have any weird smell that sometimes sunscreen has.

I love adding a super watery cream underneath it, 
cz indeed is a bit dry on the skin. * I've recently discovered that this mineral sun screen pairs perfectly with Bare Minerals makeup! So much better than using a primer! Be sure to wash your face and moisturize prior to applying the sun screen and makeup. It really helps to keep your skin from feeling dry. 

The consistency is very liquidy. It doesnt feel sticky. Although it does leave a white cast when worn alone so I avoid doing so. Instead, I apply the Shiseido stick sun screen when im bare faced. I havent experienced any eye irritations with this."

Went out to the pool in this super hot weather and realized this was the perfect opportunity to test out the sunscreen. The sunscreen is smooth and not tacky when being applied to the skin. It does not leave that nasty white residue that most of other known sunscreens leave. The product smells so good that I am able to utilize it on a daily basis when going out! Highly recommend! * If you love sweet and fruity sents- this is it. It smells like a fruity drink from your favorite pool bar. It has a sheen/glowy finish without glitter! I am a distance runner and it is sweat proof and I have yet to get a sunburn! Overall my favorite sunscreen i have ever used. My only complaint it is does get a tad greasy- I wouldnt say it is terrible, but i dont mind greasy when im running! * This is so lush and smells heavenly. I loved using this before going outside in my walks knowing my skin smelled amazing and was protected

I can't imagine how bad it would be for anyone with a medium to dark complextion.

It also left a noticeably tacky film on top of my skin, it might be okay to use under makeup but not on its own. * Good texture but leaves a white cast * So far so good, I've only used for a week, it absorbs quickly, it's not oily, still haven't noticed any brightening but I probably need to give it time * its perfect lightweight GREAT FOR YOUR SKIN my skin glows after this and is poreless and tight i love it * I am a fan of Derma-E products, but this item indicated on the packaging that it was light weight and it is very thick and does not absorb nicely * This moisturizer doesn't clog my pores or break me out. I do feel like the vitamin c has lightened my dark spots. Rating it 4 stars because It does leave a white cast. I have fair skin and it does sink in, but it could be an issue on darker skin."

Following the directions I apply generously to face and neck, but didn't re-apply every 2 hours--just once more in the middle of the day on no makeup days. The tube lasted less than 2 weeks using it this way. WAY too spendy * I received this product as a sample initially, and I will say that I hesitated to try it because I usually only use products labeled ""clean"" and ""cruelty-free"" and this is neither of those. Additionally, this moisturizer has a slight fragrance which would usually disqualify it from my regimen but I got hooked on the scent and the effect. I had 2 small wrinkles between my eyebrows and after using this, they're gone. I use this over my serums and facial creams and I'll buy this again and again. * I love the moisturizing, glowy feeling of the product with SPF! Perfect for daily use. * I don't ever leave reviews bit hos product is amazing! I have worked for dermatology offices for years and have been fortunate to try many different sunscreen products but this one may be my favorite ever! It's not sticky, goes on smooth and leaves a beautiful glow and looks so natural! * This product goes on very heavy and greasy so I was already nervous.  I headed out on a hike and six miles in, it started melting and oozing into my eyes.  There was nothing I could do at that point. Worst sunscreen ever. Buy Goop Unseen Sunscreen. * Best SPF ever. I love the glowy finish and it even works under my makeup. * I tried this in store while shopping and immediately fell in love, I've been using it for 2 weeks now. The glow that it gives my skin is beautiful, it also does not leave a white cast nor feels like a traditional SPF. I even tried it under makeup and it made everything look dewier and smoother. I highly recommend!"
240,sun bum,mineral lotion spf 30,pimprod2021610,2575600," * I love Sun Bum products and really wanted to love this. I was looking for a high SPF mineral formula without too much of a white cast. This was OK on first application - a little thick though so you need to work it in; then as you reapply, it turns into glue. Takes a lot to get it off of your body in the shower. However, no sunburns with multiple applications. No skin irritation. * It's not terrible, but I do not like it remotely, HALF as much as I like the Ulta brand one. I'm new to mineral sunscreens and I bought 2 from Sun Bum and 1 from Ulta. Both of the Sun Bum mineral sunscreens (SPF 30 and 50) are chunky and ridiculously harder to spread on the body. I felt like I was spreading toothpaste, or bondo on my legs and arms. I couldn't imagine trying to put it on my face. The Ulta brand is a sheer delight to put on in comparison. I felt like I COULDN'T rub it in and get past the white cast, and I am so pale I could blend in with a cloud. After seeing how hard it was on my legs (30SPF) and arms (50SPF), I didn't DARE use it on my face and I used the Ulta instead. 50SPF was the intended sunscreen for the face, but that wasn't happening with how delicate my face is from acne right now. Yeesh. I'll use the Sun Bums, and my husband will, but I definitely wouldn't repurchase it. Makes me reconsider the entire line from this brand after both tubes were so much chunkier in consistency and THICCER than your girls thighs versus Ulta's. * This is thick upon applying it, but after about 10 minutes it settles. I love this for my sensitive, allergy-prone skin. It is also chemical free which is great for sensitive skin! My favorite part is the no white cast. I don't know how they managed to do it without tinting it, but this is POC friendly. Also doesn't pill like most physical sunscreens do. * I purchased to use as a moisturizer sunscreen per recommendation of store associate to protect hyperpigmentation. This product is very thick and sticky. It burns my skin also. Not a good purchase. * I used the spf 50 version of this formula, but sadly it was too heavy for me and caused breakouts. This formula seems much lighter, the white cast is not bad, and the feel is good! Still a bit on the heavier side of sunscreens for me, which is why this is going to be my go-to winter sunscreen. I won't bother to look for another, this one does it the best! * A little background on my skin: I'm a redhead and have very fair/ pale skin (alabaster foundation) which is moderately sensitive and burns easily (and won't ever tan, it just peels and burns again). This sunscreen uses fragrance, but doesn't irritate my skin. It feels lightweight and not greasy. The formula is thin enough to easily apply and rub in quickly (much better than the Cotz mineral sunscreen for face and body, non tinted). It smells like coconut, which I love, and doesn't leave a cast or sticky grease layer on my skin.
If you have a deeper complexion than me and are concerned about a cast, I couldn't say for sure but I think this stuff is worth a try since it's so thin and rubs in so well. If you have very sensitive skin, just tread carefully as the scent is very strong. Definitely worth a try, but keep the receipt just in case it doesn't work for you. Hope this helps! * The only downside is that this uses fragrance. Thankfully, my skin isn't extremely sensitive so this is okay for me, but if you have very sensitive skin or are allergic to coconut I would tread carefully if you try this. If you don't have sensitive skin, it smells so nice and absorbs quickly without leaving a cast. However, I have very pale skin (I usually use Alabaster foundation with cool undertone) and don't know if this will leave a cast if you have a deeper complexion. It's thin enough that it's probably worth a try though, since you can rub it in so well. Hope this is helpful!"
241,cotz,mineral sun stick spf 45,pimprod2036814,2606141," * Very frustrated that Cotz advertises itself as healthy and ecoconcious when non of its products are. This Product received a poor raring on Yuka App. Product contains many harmful ingredients including dimethicone  which harms the environment and ends up in the blood of fish, birds and mammals building up in the environment without ever breaking down. Cotz advertising is an example of brand green washing at its finest. * This is good for touch ups when you're on the go. Despite being a stick format, it has a mousse like texture. I like that it can fit in a pocketbook (the cylinder shape makes it awkward for a pants pocket). This does feel heavy on my skin (normal/balanced type) and has a sticky/tacky feel after application. This also left a whitecast on my skin (Fitzpatrick type 2, fair Asian Skin, wear clinque foundation in shade bone; I swiped at least 4x per section of my face to have adequatecl coverage). The finish is definitely on the shiny side, especially for me. My preference is for matte or skinlike finish, so this was too shiny for me, but someone who likes a glowy finish may like this. I would recommend this for someone with fair skin on the dry side (or balanced/normal in a dry climate) and doesn't mind a shinier/""glowy"" finish."
242,ulta beauty collection,mineral sunscreen lotion spf 50,pimprod2003870,2536168," * I like how its not greasy and it dries matte but the white cast is so terrible. Im medium tan skin tone so i end up looking like a clown. Seriously its like white face paint on me and its hard to blend after it dries. Couldnt put foundation on too because it ended up pilling and made me look like i had patches * I use this daily on my face, neck, chest, and hands, alone or as a primer. I do rub it in well and have learned to avoid my eyelids, but around my eyes is fine. If you have oily skin, this one may not stay put. I have combination skin, fair and pink and prone to sunburn. It is one of the only mineral sunscreens that I will put on my face because I'm prone to breakouts. It's this or Cotz. Since Cotz is a tiny tube for the money, I got this to travel with and not need a separate body sunscreen. I've never gone back!

On your body, be sure to rub it in well. If you don't, it will transfer to your clothes. * It leaves a horrible white cast, and melts off when I sweat. It's really thick, and no matter how little I use, or how much I blend, I can't make it work. * It leaves a horrible white cast, and melts off when I sweat. It's really thick, and no matter how little I use, or how much I blend, I can't make it work. * I've been using this daily for about 2 weeks and love it.  I don't have any issues with a white cast so I'm not sure if other reviewers who have are using it correctly. I have dark olive skin and it looks fine on me. Just rub it in good.  It doesn't get greasy at all. I'm very pleased and will buy again. * Number 1, you need to use 1/4 tsp on your face and neck to get the spf protection on the label, for any brand. But the awful white cast just made me use less. Using the proper amount would make me look like a ghost. In fact, it actually did in a group photo a friend posted. When I saw it I was like OH NO. And I even had foundation over it. Also nice that you can't even read the new packaging. I'll use this up on my feet or arms I guess. * The scent is super strong and leaves a white cast."
243,supergoop!,zincscreen 100% mineral lotion spf 40,pimprod2042924,2621275," * I work in dermatology and have tried a LOT of sunscreens. I am very particular about sunscreen and this one checks all the boxes. It's all mineral, cruelty free, SPF 40, lightly tinted and a little bit hydrating. I have very fair skin and this blends in perfectly. Would work for light to medium skin tones. Would definitely recommend! * I've been using this sunscreen consistently for about a year and I love it.  It's lightweight, blends easily, and works well under makeup. * This is my favorite sunscreen and always need it in my skincare routine! I love the glow it gives me. It works perfectly under my makeup! * The second ingredient is Tetradecane which is toxic and known to cause cancerous tumors in mice. Deceitful marketing by saying it has ""clean"" ingredients. * I understand the 1 Star review, and it depends on the user and when the product is used.  I live in TX, and it is hot, hot, hot and humid so need something for my mornings in the garden with hat, etc.  Also, on a beach or for walking as eyeliner is my only real necessity going out the door for these activities.  I vary between a liquid foundation and a powder and am using the Mineral Matte Screen SPF 40. Matte products work best for me here. * This sunscreen is oily and made mg face look like a greased skillet. I waited ten minutes and then put on liquid foundation, and it was a slippery mess. Brush strokes all over my face. 
I cant say one nice thing about this product."
244,avÃ¨ne,hydrance+ moisturizing sunscreen lotion spf 30,pimprod2043842,2620352," * I really wanted to love this product because it is clean and highly rated on Yuka. However, it doesnt sink into the skin and I ended up with little white pilling all over my face. I tried using after thoroughly hydrsting my skin and still the same issue. Would not recommend * Oil-free but feels slimy and has a weird smell.  I have combo skin so it feels really greasy.  Glad I got it on sale and won't repurchase. * Might work on super dry skin, but not for my normal (sometimes normal/oily combo) skin.   Makeup is sliding off after 30 minutes.  Glad I purchased while on sale because not worth the full price.  Will keep to use on hands and neck since it does not smell and still need sunscreen protection. * I live by Avene products and wanted to love this so badly. Maybe I got a bad batch, but there is a lingering smell to this that I just cant get past. * As someone who has tried dozens of sunscreens, this one is elite in my opinion. The skincare in it makes my skin so glowy and hydrating and I love how dewy my skin looks when wearing. It wears well under make up, but you do have to rub it in well to prevent the white cast and so that the product absorbs in fully. It does feel a little bit sticky and a little heavy, but I don't necessarily mind that. Overall it feels more like skincare than sunscreen in my opinion and I will definitely repurchase."
245,proactiv,clear skin spf 30 face sunscreen,pimprod2033282,2595005," * Really liked the lightweight feel and absorption. Didn't break my skin out. However each time I wore this my forehead got burned. Definitely applied enough and wasn't out longer than recommended or sweating heavily. This has not happened wirh the other SPF products I've worn under my foundation. So I gave the rest to my darker-complected husband to use 🤣 * Gosh I wanted to love this so bad! It's lightweight, non-greasy, and gives my skin a nice glow. However, every time I use it, by the next day, there's zits that pop up. This is the only new product I've introduced. I believe it's the tocopheryl. :( * Very irritating * I need to wear sunscreen daily because of my acne products, but I've yet to find one that doesn't clog my pores even further. Seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I bought this when it was on sale. Sadly, it doesn't live up to the hype. It was lightweight on my skin, but it smells like cheap body sunblock. And every time I used it I had a new zit forming by the end of the day, without changing anything else in my skin routine. I wanted this to work so badly, but it does the opposite of being good for acne prone skin. * I was going to give 4 stars because it has a Proactiv scent I'm not in love with, However 5 stars because it does a great job as an spf as well as clearing up your face at the same time. * Since I am using retinol, my dermatologist insists that I wear sunscreen.  I have struggled to find any spf sunscreen that my reactive sensitive oily acne-prone mature skin doesn't breakout to and react to.

This is my first facial sunscreen success.  This one is great!  Doesn't leave me greasy or overly shiny.  Doesn't irritate or break out my skin.  I only wish it was higher spf, but better spf 30 than nothing. * I have very oily skin and hate wearing SPF. I have trial and errored so many mositurizers and this is the best one. Doesn't feel greasy or heavy on my skin. Actually has cut down on me looking greasy throughout the day. Highly recommend!"

This one feels very gritty going on takes a good while to absorb and dry down and it pilled as well. Does feel better after applying the moisturizer as recommended. Face now feels soft and not oily or greasy. Not sure if I will continue to use as my spf after this is finished, also small amount and expensive to use every day. * It is a more than wonderful serum for oily skin. It makes the skin clear, fresh, hydrated and free of blemishes. Youthful, attractive and vibrant. It makes the skin like the skin of children. It is like magic for the skin. * I lobe beautystat all products. vitamin C serum looks amazing would love to try. * I love the texture of this product so much & what it does for my skin. * This is one of my faves from beautystat! This has vitamin c in it as well as sunscreen! I love this two in one daily serum, not only does it protect me from the daily harmful rays but it also helps brighten my skin as it's preventing & eliminating my dark spots, wrinkles, and fine lines! I've only tried this for a few weeks and I can already see the difference and smoothness in my face and my neck! You should give it a try, followed by their amazing moisturizer! * Very good serum and it's a good price. I highly recommend it. I will continue to buy it. It brightens up my skin. * This has a gritty texture and leaves a little bit of a white cast. But thats expected from a mineral SPF and a small price to pay for a good formula. I feel good about using this as my daily protection because it gives my skin the brightening benefits of vitamin c.  Ill repurchase this. Its worth the money."

I've ordered 2 each, of this product, at 3 different occasions and every single time, they have been expired! Then, I called Customer Service and, while they have been efficient at reimbursing my money, they send me labels to return the products.  So, in addition of being out of the product I need, I have now spent extra gas going to the post office, besides having to send them pictures of the items, that they've requested.  Ulta get it together! * I trust PTR products but I prefer mineral sunscreen for my face. Ulta carries the 2 PTR chemical based spfs. They discontinued the MINERAL SPF 45. WHY?! 😭 Plus these other two options are 12 and 50% MORE expensive?! and they provide NO TINT. 

Don't fix what's not broke. Please bring back the PTR MINERAL TINTED SPF 45.
Ugh. * Love this product, however, Ulta is out of it for the most part. Hard to get it here * I love this product.   I purchased it directly from Peter Thomas Roth's website.   I have used it for about a month now every day.  I can put it on my actual eye lid and entire eye area without reaction on one eye but not the other eye.  Strange  that I have one eye more sensitive than my other eye.  Living in Michigan we need extra Vitamin D during the winter.   This has that plus SPF 50 broad spectrum  UVA UV B protection etc.  When I put this on each morning and look at my skin after application,  I smile.   Each and every time,  I smile.  My skin glows and looks beautiful.   Makeup optional after applying this because it makes my skin look that healthy and beautiful.  I've use Peter Thomas Roth products for decades after my mom started gifting me his products.   I'm 52 but people say I look like I'm in my 30's.  Love that bonus from being a long time customer of PTR. * super soft and light weight makes my skin glow i have a mixed skin type so im not really oily but this is the second bottle im going to get!!! (: literally love it and recommend if you want sunscreen thats light and watery and makes your skin glow < 3 * Skin is glowing and protected * I recently switched from Cerave am spf30 which left my skin feeling dry and would have to combine with cocoa butter. I've been using this product for about 2 weeks. I have eczema and this leaves my face feeling moisturized for the entire day. No white cast, lightweight but offered full coverage. A little goes a long way. It's good but expensive which is my reason for the 4 stars. My face feels more hydrated and softer."
248,peter thomas roth,max matte shine control sunscreen broad spectrum spf 45,pimprod2023948,2579754," * This product isnt matte at all * I like the no shine look * One of the best mattifying sunscreens I've tried! Its perfect for my very oily skin and actually keeps me matte most of the day! I'm not in a very humid climate though. It works very well as a primer underneath a tinted moisturizer I use as well. * Sits on skin. Doesn't sink in. Stays white and wipes right off. * Nice sunscreen! Dries matte. Don't rub it in too much, it will roll off on your skin. * I love the way it absorbs into my oily skin and gives me a matt finish. It's not greasy and it's not fragrant. It is wonderful for in the hot Alabama sun and damp winter. * I have combo skin that in summer humidity is extremely oily and acne prone. This product is the absolute best product I have ever used to control shine, including regular non SPF moisturizers. Normally, I have to blot my face a dozen times a day, no exaggeration, and with this I don't have to blot at all! Life changing! It works amazing under makeup and the sun protection lasts all day. This does not dry the skin and I used it alone without another moisturizer. I use this even when not going outside just for the matte finish. It does not cause acne either. LOVE it. I read another review that mentioned pilling, I did not experience this."
249,dr. brandt,bright this way liquid sun shield spf 50,pimprod2039665,2613316," * Just recently traveled to the mountains in Utah. This was the sunscreen I used for my face and hands. I was shocked and amazed by how well this sunscreen worked. I was outside for hours at a time and did not have the opportunity to reapply and I did not get burned. I am a very fair skinned person that easily burns. That is the most important part, but also, no greasy residue and I have used at home and used makeup on top and had no issues with my makeup. The dropper is well, a dropper, so you just need to be patient when getting it out of the bottle and it is not an issue and you don't need much to cover your face. This is what I will use for facial sunscreen for as long as they continue to make it."
250,supergoop!,play 100% mineral lotion spf 50 with green algae,pimprod2037485,2606309," * Does it work? Yes. Otherwise. it leaves a very noticeable white cast on my fair/light skin. It is also difficult to rub in as it is a thicker formula. * I have medium colored skin and this peoduct left whitecast , it drys put ur skin and it is not possible to blend out once applied * I made the mistake of trying this right before leaving for vacation. The one day I wear it, my face/neck/arms turn very red, and extremely itchy and uncomfortable. As soon as this happened, I switched to products I know are safe for my skin. I slept with vaseline on my face the first night. The second day, my face was extremely swollen/puffy/inflamed. After I took a cool shower, the swelling reduced but it became extemely red, itchy, and uncomfortable again. This is currently day 3 after only using the product once, and my skin is only a little less red and less itchy, and when I use products I know are safe on my skin, it is now burning. Please DO NOT USE if you have sensitive skin!!!! * I bought this product since I heard good reviews about it. It left a white cast and it was very dry as well. * I ran put of sunscreen sooner than expected. The hotel was selling this sunscreen. I was a bit hesitant because I break out easily, but had to purchase since we were staying on a beach with intense sun. I wore this for 3 days, reapplied every few hours, and I did not get a single sunburn. Surprisingly, I also did not break out. There is a slight white cast, which I don't mind as it makes my skin look a bit glowy. I definitely would repurchase this sunscreen. * So, i guess mineral sunscreens just arent meant for me. I tried a bit on my hand in the store and was hopeful because it didnt leave a shiny grease spot on me, and i didnt notice the white pallor it left (dang tricky store lighting) but with the first face application, i could see i made a mistake. I am VERY fair to begin with and now i look like Casper with this lotion! Add to it the slight sting it causes and dry flaky skin the next day and this is just ALL bad. Only reason i gave 2 stars is because of the non-greasyness * I wanted to try something new for once. I put it on, it felt fine and looked fine. the next day I woke up and my face was flaky, red, and burning. I couldn't go anywhere for a few days not even to work!"

I honestly prefer have have some white cast than having sunburn, early aging or chemical in my blood that will affect me in the future in some point. * It is mineral, is not greasy, doesn´t leave a white cast BUT I preffer something more liquid, more light.
And it expensive considering the content. * this sunscreen is great. at first i was not a fan but as continued to use it i found that the pros outweighed the cons. what i love about it is that one pump goes a long way and it spreads nicely. i also love that it doesnt leave a white cast. i apply this on my facial hair and it dries clear. its pretty insane. i was gagged when it dried clear on my BEARED! i was sold after that. it also leaves the skin tacky and glowy, which i love. the only con is that its watery but i noticed that it allows the sunscreen to spread and glide across the skin nicley. like i said, a little goes a long way. i think for people with facial hair, its hard to reach the skin underneath, so i do use more than the avergave person. its a decent amount of product for the price but for people who need to use more, it can be just enough for like a month. nonethless, she did what needed to be done. * I usually don't write reviews but I had such a terrible experience with this product that I felt it was only fair to share my results because my skin looked the worst that it has ever looked in my life!!

I had been using Mario Badescu's Hydro Moisturizer w/ Vit C and my skin was looking great with no breakouts.  Unfortunately, that moisturizer doesn't have SPF in it so I decided to try this sunscreen.  My skin isn't sensitive, but it could not handle this sunscreen. I experienced terrible breakouts around my jawline (which has never happened before) and it took a long time for my skin to clear.

I am a fan of Mario B's products, just not this one… * This is the most misunderstood sunscreen. It is so beautiful and lightweight. The glow is so  amazing! It wears beautifully under makeup too! * has a white cast… * I am always looking for a good mineral sunscreen. The ladies at Ulta recommended this one -and they were right! 
Lightweight, blends easily, slight white cast when first applied (I expect that with a mineral formula) but after waiting the requisite 15 minutes-it has disappeared into my skin. 
Good price point too"

The smell is super strong (smells like a hair oil but not inherently unpleasant), but it does not fade away. The pro to that is if you  put it on your scalp, you hair will smell great. The con is I don't want to smell that on my face and body all day. Had to return it for that reason. * I don't use a lot of bells and whistles on my skin but this is perfect for my everyday routine! * **RUN, DON'T WALK to grab R&R Sun Elixir!**  

I'm not usually a product person, but I picked this up on a whim, and WOW—I am *so* glad I did. This has completely transformed my morning routine because I genuinely *look forward* to using it every day. The scent? Absolutely divine. The texture? Perfectly smooth and lightweight. And the best part? It leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and hydrated *without* that heavy, greasy feel.  

If you're looking for a product that delivers luxury and nourishment in one bottle, **this is it.** Trust me, your skin will thank you! * This is a lightweight oil that is easy to use as a last step on top of my moisturizer! It rubs in quickly and isn't too oily * Pretty lightweight, hydrating and gives a subtle glow,feels nice on skin ,my combination skin looooovessss itt. * I'm absolutely in love with this product! It gives a beautiful glow without feeling greasy at all. I've been using it on my face, neck, and even in my hair—it works wonders everywhere! Plus, I'm so excited to support a fantastic Black-owned brand. It truly feels great to celebrate diversity while enjoying such an amazing product! * this is the only face oil I will use on my skin, it doesn't break me out and locks in hydration!!

I tried to overlook it, but its a no from me personally * Love this SPF it has a bit of a white cast but that goes away super fast it absorbs really well and I use my skin feeling good and not too oily * This is the 3 time that I've purchased this product.

It gives me a perfect light finish over my face, that being said i have pretty fair skin. I love how i can still see my freckles through it. I really like the way it smells too. It doesnt rub off when i apply my eye makeup, or if i scratch my face, and it doesnt pill up. It doesnt come out of the pump though, i just scoop it out apply it with my hands. I was stressed that pacifica discontinued all their foundations, so i tried this and im so happy i did because it works for me even better than their foundation. I will also add that i have acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. I hope they never stop making this product because its perfect for me. * I bought this looking for an SPF that would help even my skin tone, protect me from the sun, and hydrate my skin. 
This product feels like you're rubbing chalk on your face. It is super thick and hard to spread around your face, so you can't even blend it in. 
Forget about layering makeup on top of it, even by itself it leaves you with a cakey look. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product. I won't even be finishing what I have left of it. * This product feels like rubbing clay on your face, super drying and difficult to blend even on fair skin would not recommend * Goes on smoothly and has a slight scent to it. I don't notice any color tho. So nice for a sunscreen that sinks into your skin but my skin looks no different in tone after putting it on. * This is super lightweight, moisturizing, and easy to blend. It doesn't have a noticeable tint once its applied, and the spf level is great for everyday use but not prolonged sun exposure. A lot of reviews mention whitecast or pilling- I haven't had issues with either. I am very pale though. I only use it with other pacifica products, which might help prevent pilling. It's nice but I'll probably opt for the spf30 lotion once I run out. * apples like chalk * Actyally the worst sunscreen ever :( HORRIBLE white cast and pilled an insane amount. I waited for all of my products to absorb before putting this on and it still pilled like crazy and left an AWFUL white cast"

Overall pass. * At first i loved it except the strong fragrance. After a week of use its leaving ny skin burning. I hope i can return. I really wantes to be able to use this because i do like the consistency and how quickly it absorbs. * I love the clean ingredients, it leaves no white cast, feels light on the skin, and doesn't make my makeup pill! Seriously my ride or die."
