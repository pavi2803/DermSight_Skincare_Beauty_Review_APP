1,1,1,1,tula,protect + glow daily sunscreen gel broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2016249,2562776," * love this sunscreen, doesnt give a white cast * Did an all day wear test first without make-up and it was definitely glowy. Just added a little lip gloss, some blush, and a dash of powder and it stayed the same all day. Would definitely recommend for a non-tinted sunscreen. I have oily acne prone skin and old scars. Nice ingredient list, too! * Super glowy and nice but the smell smells like a hangover * I don't have sensitive skin and have experimented with many problems. After using this for two day, my face broke out into red and clear itchy bumps. This was the only thing i changed and won't be using again. * I applied this, waited 30 minutes, went outside to do yardwork and burned terribly. Not woth the $$ or the chemical exposure. * I've been using this sunscreen on my face now for over a year and really like it a lot!  It definitely gives a slight glow and I can wear it under my foundation without any issues.  Smell is nice too.  I would highly recommend it. * I have bought several bottles of this and will continue to use. loooove the glow it gives. lightweight and moisturizing but not oily."
2,2,2,2,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen spf 40,pimprod2029930,2589386," * i checked the ingredients and they're all non-pore clogging. i use it as a primer and it's amazing!! my skin is oily and dry in some spots, and i have hormonal acne but this product has helped so much with avoiding breakouts. * I have the regular sized product and I like it.  I decided to get a travel size but it is so small it's not worth the price so I returned it. * I wanted to love this sunscreen at first. I went a few days being okay with it since it gave a soft feeling on the skin. But after a few hours my skin would be oily. And after days i started getting bumps all over my face, mostly my forehead. This clogged my pores really bad. I know this didnt work out for me but i always recommended to ask for samples to try things out rather than just buying it. * This sunscreen broke me out and gave me bumps and milia all over my face and neck! Do not recommend. * This is my favorite sunscreen. * I love this product and buy again and again. * I have heard a lot of good things about this spf, so I have it a try. I have sensitive skin and the first day using it my skin would burn slightly. I tried to look past it, but it would leave my skin burning so bad after repeated uses."
3,3,3,3,la roche-posay,anthelios uv correct spf 70 daily face sunscreen with niacinamide,pimprod2030180,2591831," * I have to use another sunscreen under this to get near my eyes and mouth. If I get anywhere near my eyes it somehow will work it's way into them. I keep it because it's a high SPF, doesn't look awful on the skin, absorbs well, and has a nice texture. 
But boy does it sting. I try to only put it up near my hairline on my forehead and slightly below my cheeks bones to keep it away from my eyes. Then I thoroughly wash my hands just in case. 
I also keep it away from my lips at all costs because it's got a lingering taste * Even if I don't rub the moisturizer around my eyes it still stings!! It doesn't soak into the skin and as the day goes rhe product starts to melt into my eyes and lips. It tastes soooo bad. * Wanted to love this so much! Not impressed :/ it has a wonderful texture, blends in smoothly, and leaves no whitecast! However it stings your eyes like crazy and kind of just sits on your skin making you look and greasy for the whole day. Was genuinely expecting a more elegant wear experience especially for the price. * Do NOT put this around your eyes. It stings worse than anyrhing i could imagine. My eyes are still so swollen. I had to pull over and rinse them out with a water bottle and they still wouldnt stop burning!! I wanted to love this product. It has a really nice texture and goes on smoothly, but this sort of eye sting is unacceptable. * It leaves my face greasy for the rest of the day and makes my makeup seem to 'sweat' off when I wear it. I'll be using up the bottle but for my body when I'm in the sun this summer. * I really like how it is not greasy and does not leave a white cast. I thought I found my go-to SPF, but I got red bumps on my forehead, and they were gone when I stopped using it. It might not be suitable for acne-prone and oily skin. * Wore it to go on a walk outside a few weeks ago, and it eventually got to my eyes it burned so bad. Really irritates eyes…the purpose of sunblock to avoid sun damage is to also apply it on eyelids or around eye area. Avoid applying around the eye area & thoroughly was your hands after applying if you buy this."

5,5,5,5,vacation,classic whip spf 30 sunscreen mousse,pimprod2033019,2596247," * I love this products packaging, so much so I decided to cheat on my SuperGoop sunscreen to try it. Unfortunately, the fragrance, though pleasant, is a little too strong and ideally, products that go on your face should not have fragrance. Also, over time it will run in your eyes and every time I use it, it stings my eyeballs. It makes your skin super glowy, but if youre a oily girlie like me, it will, after a few hours of wear, make you look GREASY. So if you dont have sensitive skin and if you have drier skin this is the product for you. If your skin reacts to fragrance or if you have oily/combo skin, I'd reach for something else. * While its cute and protects nicely from the sun, it burns my eyes. * The whipped consistency makes application a breeze. Only need a quick squeeze and you can cover pretty much your whole body! Will buy again once I run out. Smells great! * My 5year old now LOVES wearing sunscreen. Everytime we go to the pool or the beach she wants the whip. We are very fair skinned, but no one has gotten even the slightest bit pink all summer because this stuff is just too fun to wear and reapply! * I really wanted to like this and got 2 bottles because I run out of sun screen fast but first it stung my eyes everytime i used it and although it smells good, it has a distinct scent of acetone or something and it doesn't really go away. I haven't broken more than usual but it has been making anything plastic (like sunglasses, make up palettes, everything) melt or turn them very brittle because of the harsh chemical. * I just knew i had gotten the right product.  Unfortunately within 30 mins on i had to run and shower it off.  The beautiful shine turned WHITE on my dark skin. * I love the smell and texture of this product, but it caused me to develop an awful case of contact dermatitis that lasted 2 weeks. Fortunately I tested it only on my forearms. Definitely patch test this product before applying it all over your body."
6,6,6,6,kopari beauty,sunglaze sheer body mist sunscreen spf 42,pimprod2043793,2618935," * I was really excited about this product. The bottle had leaked during shipping so it was not full. I used it for the first time and the bottle top wouldnt lock and spilled when i picked it up. The cheap bottle made it not worth it. Really disappointed. * Beautiful coverage but not an effective sunscreen. I used it many many time per day both before and after swimming and ongoing. After three days the bottle is 85% used and I am 100% burned. I left the bottle in the resort trash. 

I really wanted to like it because the bottle and liquid are so pretty and it's very easy to apply. * Due to the spray top, i opened it and am using the solution directly in my hand. Hate to waste money * Love the sprayer because you can use it upside down. I thought it would be a little more shimmery and glowy. This is totally ineffective as SPF. It did nothing for me, and i burned even though I reapplied and used it liberally. I'd rather use real sunscreen and then use an addordable glowy soray or lotion over top. This was a waste of money tbh. I have a photo as well. * I must say this is the best sun color enhancing protection that exists. I have a severe problem that product does not come full or does not apply as it should base on price. * When I was applying this it sprayed a few times but then wouldn't spray again so I couldn't even get one use out of it. From what I did apply it doesn't seem worth it. It has a weird feel to it that's oily and doesn't shimmer much at all. I'm sad I wasted so much money on this especially since I can't even get it out of the bottle to use it. * Unsure if it leaked in transit like others mentioned or if it just wasn't manufactured completely full, but for the price I'm not thrilled. I wanted to like it."
7,7,7,7,supergoop!,on-the-go spf duo,pimprod2044871,2623031, * buy this now and throw it in your purse for the summer! this is the best sunscreen. a little bit goes a long way and it's so light weight! * Loved this sunscreen
8,8,8,8,supergoop!,play everyday lotion spf 50 with sunflower extract pa++++,pimprod2030629,2589403," * It was good. It was a little sticky, no white cast and it smells weird. * Too sticky. Uncomfortable to wear * I love the producy hate the packaging. I just brought one and went on a road trip and i feel kike i wasted 1/2 the product. It leaks and separates everywhere. At the end of the day buy the smaller size. The chances of the product spilling are much more insignificant. Not worth the hassel. * I'm white. I burn. The only  kind of tan I csn get is fake. Buy this stuff for yourself and family. Your parents need sunblock too and may not use it  The PA ++++ on the label indicates a higher than usual level of protection which means  it's the GOOD STUFF. Use it year round  and thank me later * I've been using this product for while now and i will never use another sunscreen bc this one is not only perfect to wear everyday but to use as a primer under makeup. * The susncreen is easy to apply and leaves no white cast. The scent is pleasant as well. The only downside to this sunscreen is that it is very greasy/oily on. If you have really dry skin this may leave you ""glowy"", but not if you have oily skin. * I love how this absorbs into my skin with no white cast! It leaves me so glowy and moisturized. This is favorite sunscreen and i use it EVERYDAY. so obsessed I recommend it to everyone."
9,9,9,9,la roche-posay,anthelios melt-in milk body & face sunscreen lotion spf 100,pimprod2013150,2559778," * I really liked how this sunscreen had a high SPF, didn't feel super greasy, and didn't have whitecast. I absolutely loved it as a body sunscreen. My issue came with using it on my face. I would put it everywhere except near my eyes but they still burned. every. single. time. This is the first time I've experienced this with a facial suncreen. * It was my first time trying the la roche 100 spf sunscreen during my vacation in the Bahamas, and lets just say I am never going to any other brand! 

My skin ALWAYS burns, I swear I am essentially a vampire with how delicate my skin is, but this sunscreen saved the day! I reapplied as needed, and made sure to allow it to dry fully before attempting to get near water. * I have stubborn and recurring melasma. After searching some Reddit subs, alot of people said that spf 100 protected their skib better. This product is not greasy for me and i wear it over a moisturizer. It doesnt pill for me either. It makes my skin glow and there is no white cast. I have dark brown skin. * I've been using this for over a year. No white cast, great under my makeup. In the sunshine state of AZ sunscreen is a MUST!  Highly recommend!! * I've repurchased it multiple times, its amazing. * This product ""melts"" onto the skin, but my skin doesnt really absord it & my face looks greasy all day long. It hasnt made me break out and im currently trying to tackle my acne, so homestly i dont care if i look greasy right now if it means i dont have active pimples. Do not put it in the orbit of your eye (under your brow/under your eye), because it burns so bad if you rub your eye or do soemthing to get it in your eye. I had to use the eye wash station at school because my eyes were uncontrollably crying from how bad it burns. Overall though i really like this product because it gets the job done, feels lightweight, doesnt make me break out, and doesnt make me look white * I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE this sunscreen. Ive been using it for about a year now and I will probably forever be using it."
10,10,10,10,vacation,orange gelÃ©e spf 30 sunscreen gel,pimprod2044868,2623026," * GOOD: I really love the texture and the smell of this! I wanted to pick up a SPF that wasn't SPF smelling, and this is it. 
CON: It does state to use a water resistant SPF if planning on swimming or sweating. Keep that in mind before buying. * first off, if you think it doesn't smell like the origional you clearly have long COVID. scent is AMAZING. only downside is texture. slightly grainy at first. 9/10 * this leaves a sticky film and has an overwhelming baby powder smell. I'd return it if I didn't buy it with my points 😬 * I ordered and was excited! I loved Bain de Soleil!! This company tries to emulate but falls very short. High spf, which isnt for me. But the smell is a funky version wannabee. I dont recommend it if you wore rhe original. * I was very excited to try this product because I love the original orange suntanning gel. Unfortunately, this is a poor attempt to copy that and smells horrible. It has given me a horrible headache and I can't even get the smell off.

DO NOT BUY. * This smells nothing at all like the original scent. The vacation interpretation has a strong metallic smell to it, almost like blood? Gross. I appreciate the effort but they need to try again. * I'm very enamored with the company Vacation so i was happy that I grabbed the last orange gelée at my local ulta. I've never experienced the original orange gelée but I'm enjoying this current iteration. This version added more moisturizing ingredients which is great for our dry, desert heat. I generally like mineral oil but replacing it with other butters and oils is nice. I like that the broad spectrum SPF 30 that is reef-safe. I get to be safely shiny and bronzed :)"

14,14,14,14,vacation,super spritz spf50 face mist,pimprod2038618,2606383," * Obviously you shouldn't get this in your eyes but if it does get in even just a little bit, it's so bad. I couldn't open my eyes in the sun and it stung for over 24 hrs. I even washed my eyes out at a medical office eye wash station/flushed my eyes with saline and it didn't get it out. Not worth the risk in my opinion. * bought this so i could throw it in my bag and take to the beach for reapplying face sunscreen. the lid will not stay on no matter what you do and it leaves the spray top exposed to leak product & get dirty. im shocked more people arent talking about this? i like the product but the packaging is infuriating * It's terrible for your face but amazing spritz for the body. I wish it came in a bigger bottle and marketed as a body spray. It also smells good and feels cooling but don't use it on your face. * I love this product because of the spray and it works for my skin. However, do not spill this on any type of cloth. A new bottle I received had a loose cap (which I was not aware of at first) and it spilt all over my cloth luggage and a cloth makeup pouch. I cannot get the stubborn stain out no matter what. So as a warning, if you do get this, just be really careful. * I bought this initially because of the hype about the smell and yes, it's very nostalgic. But I have been continuously impressed with how long the little bottle lasts even tho I spray generously. It also has prevented sunburn every time I've used it. * Unfortunately this did not hit the mark for me. I wanted to love this ao bad. I sprayed it over my face and had a hat on for a few hours outside and I my face was so sensitive in the sunlight! Then I sprayed it again the next few days, unfortunately it was also the only face spf I brought with me on vacation and now my face is pretty broken out and splotchy. I have to return and stick with my tallow. * I was hoping this could work and tried jt a few times over and hbder makeup. Either way at the end of the day my skin was red and swollen. I dont have this problem with any other chemical sunscreen. Would not recommend"
15,15,15,15,la roche-posay,anthelios uv hydra sunscreen spf 50 with hyaluronic acid,pimprod2043464,2620128," * I'm not sure if its the ""dewy finish"" or whatever, but this sunscreen is very oily on my skin. It feels like a layer. However it is invisible which is a plus. * I tried this off and on for about a month and i love the texture of it and how it applies and it does hydrate for a little bit but after a few hours my face would be dry. The reason i had to stop using is because it caused skin redness and my skin would appear irritated. * Loved it. It's light, great quality. * GREAT PRODUCT FROM THE FIRST USE FEELS GREAT MY SKIN FEELS SOFT * Great face lotion. Highly recommend. super hydrated not greasy. No white cast. It has a spf odor but it doesn't bother me since it feels great on my skin."

18,18,18,18,cerave,hydrating mineral sunscreen face lotion with sheer tint spf 30,pimprod2013299,2559459," * I have very fair skin and I love how it makes my skin look! It gives my arms and legs a nice glow! Great for when you are not at the pool or beach and need protection. However, I prefer the Avene tinted sunscreen for my face. * I've been looking for a budget friendly, mineral sunscreen to wear everyday and so glad I found this! No pilling, no white cast (I have brown Indian skin tone), and doesn't flare up my acne prone skin. 

Only downside is spf 30 is low coversge if I am out in the sun all day… but thats what chemical sunscreens are for i guess * I truly love this just would like to find it in a SPF 60. It's my daily and  don't have to wear foundation. I top it with loose powder just because I probably over apply and I feel it doesn't absorb completely. * Doctors only recommend this to use for melasma , it is a nice product * The title says it all, this stuff made me purple! I thought maybe it was my skin care underneath, So I washed everything off and tried again, still purple! I dont recommend if you tend to have redness in your face. * I use this over my E.L.F. skin care products. I have very dry skin so I start with E.L.F fragrance free hydrating face cream, then follow with E.L.F hydrating primer serum. The CeraVe tinted goes on right over and gives me a glow and blue effect that is minimal but just right. I wear it on shift at the hospital and my days off in the sunshine. Love it! * Blends flawlessly into my skin! Leaves my skin moisturized and glowy. 
For dry skin wear moisturizer underneath and for oily skin i would wear mattifying moisturizer underneath or powder on top"
19,19,19,19,sun bum,travel size sunscreen lotion spf 30,pimprod2014602,2564527," * it pills wouldnt buy agajn * No white cast and works well for oily skin * This made me have a terrible break out all over my cheek. Dont buy! Its ok on skin, moisturizing on body, Dont use on face. * It is the only sunscreen lotion that I buy.   I would shop around.  It is cheaper elsewhere.  Will be the last time that I buy it at your store. * Doesnt cake up under makeup! Perefect for every day use. Super light weight and smells AMAZING. * My wife put this on and missed some spots… let me say one thing she got a third degree sunburn on the areas she missed and the areas she had this on is as white as the morning we got to the river!!! * Love this stuff! I like it because it absorbs quickly and it does not leave any greasy residue. My face is sensitive so most sunscreens burn or irritate my skin for a bit, this one does not do that. Great for face and body. I live in FL so the sun is brutal, especially during summer, and I feel this sunscreen gives me good protection. Also its pretty water resistant so its great for the pool. I recommend it!"
20,20,20,20,supergoop!,mineral mattescreen spf 40,pimprod2029941,2589388," * I bought this particular item because it rated well on ewg. The texture is mousse like and blends in easily. Its tinted so it doesnt leave a white residue. It feels kind of like a primer, and it did great under my makeup. I cant speak to its effectiveness at sun protection yet but it looks promising. * I like this sunscreen and I really enjoy how it feels on my skin. It does stop a lot of oil from resurfacing on my skin throughout the day which is a plus. But it does leave an obvious white cast on my skin and takes roughly 5 minutes more or less of continously rubbing it into my skin for it to go away. I'm considering returning it, just on this alone but my skin is really enjoying the matte feel and oil control. * I have tried literally everything under the sun to keep me from getting shiny. I periodically apply powder during the day to keep my shine down. I started using the regular super goop last year. Loved it but didn't control my shine. Decided to try this and I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE PLEASED! Whatever which craft this is, i'm a lifetime fan. When I use this…. I don't even need powder, like the entire day! After a few hours I'll check the mirror, no shine! It's fantastic! I wish it was more affordable and bigger bottle… but it does last forever. A pea size amount is all that is needed. I wear my makeup over it. Has not broke me out or caused any issues. It's truly a fantastic product and an absolute must have if you tend to be oily or shiny! * The white cast was surprising because i read so many reviews. I do love how matte this sunscreen is but i will definitely be returning. * This is amazing.  Sunscreen and primer and a tint but no shimmer.  Keeps the shine down. Remember to shake the tube before applying.  Expensive but takes the place of a couple of products. * I purchased this based on a suggestion from my eyelash extension gal. I originally got Bliss facial sunscreen and it closed my fans and would break down the eyelash adhesive. Changed to this (any mineral sunscreen will do) and I love it * I love this stuff! Higher SPF, natural ingrediants that are safer for the ocean. It is slightly tinted and hide my pigmentation scars-ish just enough. Its soft and best of all, I never break out! My daughter (15) uses it and it does not burn under her eyes, and even the sensitive stuff burns her. We arw a FL fam 7 min away from the beach."
21,21,21,21,la roche-posay,anthelios melt-in milk body and face sunscreen spf 60,pimprod2018267,2570181," * This sunscreen was not greasy, but it does leave behind a slight residue. It blends in really quickly and doesn't leave a white cast on me. My only complaint is the smell. It does not smell great, I would best describe it as a chemical, powdery sunscreen smell. The scent lasts for quite a long time as well. There are other sunscreens that I prefer that don't have an unpleasant scent that I prefer, but overall this is a solid sunscreen. * I like the way I apply the sunscreen and it doesn't leave any white cast nor does it leave the skin greasy * I used to use this years ago and liked it well enough. But tried it again recently and my skin and eyes BURNED like I've never experienced! I don't know if they changed ingredients, but I will be returning this one, unfortunately. * It blends into my skin smoothly. It doesn't leave any streaks or a white cast. * The white cast is horrible. It made me look pale and ill. The cast became worse as the day went on. * I have been using this sunscreen for a few months now and while I love how moisturizing it is along with how it melts into my face, I always find that after a few hours I can feel it seeps into my eyes and absolutely irritates them so bad I can't see * This sunscreen tests pretty well, and it makes a good body sunscreen. Many sunscreens test way below the spf on the package. I wish this had a screw top. It would be easier to get out more of the product."
22,22,22,22,e.l.f. cosmetics,suntouchable whoa glow broad spectrum spf 30 sunscreen,pimprod2036596,2605491," * At first, I really liked this product. It blends great with my prefered BB cream, giving a glowing sheer finish. Unfortunately, it caused a terrible acne breakout after a week or so of daily use. Avobenzone can clog pores, and the formula's added Squalane makes this product a terrible choice for anyone with acne prone skin. * By itself, this product provides sun protection and gives a nice glow. But no matter how little I used under makeup, it made my foundation/skin tint slide off my face. A literal disgusting grease slick. And I'm normal-combo. * I have all 3 shades and I love how it gives a nice tint and shine to the face. I have pretty oily skin and it still holds up nicely throughout the day. I always wear it alone without layering foundation on top and I love how it makes my skin look. * I have been using this for about a month now. I gave it try because it applied nicely. Though after it drya down it separates on my skin and peels off. Not a fan. I'm sorry elf. * rarely use foundation or tinted moisturizer-because, this gives me everything.  beautiful silky finish not greasy & stays on all day, even in high humidity...such an affordable find...LOVE ELF!! * It made my skin super glittery and just oily it felt disgusting on my skin and i had to redo my skincare routine cause of it * I love ELF and I'm always looking for a new sunscreen. This didn't irritate my sensitive skin but it burned my eyes like crazy, and I didn't even apply it near my eyes. Shame, because it did look pretty on my skin."
23,23,23,23,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen body spf 40 invisible sun protection,pimprod2038031,2606364," * Absolutely terrible! I broke out in a rash about an hour after using. Theew it away immediately! * I love the OG unseen sunscreen for my face and its the perfect texture and viscosity. I was hoping this would be too. I hate the lotion texture of others so i was really excited that SG came out witb this. The only problem is that its just oily… it absorbs well and makes my skin feel REALLY SOFT but since i do sweat pretty easily it can feel a bit slick at times. Maybe its the olive oil in it? Or its just too many oils. * Goes on like silk and absorbs quickly. * This is a unique sunscreen. It slides onto my skin without an oily feel and immediately disappears like water. I like working in the yard. The Unseen Sunscreen Body enables me to be outside without getting a tan or sunburn in this hot summer sun. Other brands of sunscreen have felt oily and were a bit difficult to apply without some effort. The Supergoop! spread easily. It was a delightful surprise! * This sunscreen is nothing like the one for your face. It pills and rubs off with the slightest tension from clothing. It also remains slimy, so if you touch your skin at all, your hands get slimy. I threw it away, it's that bad. * The price may be high but this thing works like magic!  When it says ""Unseen"" it MEANS unseen. The sunscreen is smooth and clear on the skin. I didn't particularly smell a scent to the product but other people may smell something. It honestly did smell like a hint of regular sunscreen and wasn't strong at all. PLEASE don't by this if you want a waterproof or water reististant sunscreen. It is not either of these.  I do have quite pale skin and burn easily. With only a 50 SPF it is amazing. It is still a 5 star product that I would 100% purchase again. * The price may be high but this thing works like magic!

24,24,24,24,kopari beauty,sun on the run sunscreen travel kit,pimprod2043796,2618937," * Love the options in this kit! it's perfect for the summer. All the ingredients are clean and moisturizing, but not sticky. * My bumps on my chest came overnight . Theyre not normal, it will take MONTHS to get rid of these hard crators ! :( * Both of the face products apply wonderfully and work well under makeup. I have been looking for sunscreen with glitter and the stick gives a subtle sparkle without looking like you got attacked by a child's craft project. The price is also great - you get enough product to try before you decide if you want a full size. * yeah I had high hopes for this because it looks so pretty and shimmery in the ads but it straight up doesn't work. I was reapplying it every 30 minutes and I burned SO SO bad. very sad :( * This kit is a home run.  #1 Love the Sun Shield in a new travel friendly size.  The stick is BOMB!  I wouldn't necessarily describe it as glittery at all.  It's more of a sun-kissed glisten effect.  Soft Shield is my new fave primer. 💕❤️⛱️ Kopari * I wanted to try all 3 of these items, so I was excited to get this set. I hate the stick since it contains chunky gold glitter pieces. If they removed the glitter, it would be a great sunscreen stick. The liquid body sunscreen is nice and has a very light golden glow to it and thankfully, no glitter. The face cream is also nice, and I wanted to try it before buying a full size. The amount however, is more like a very tiny free sample size rather than a travel size that you would pay for, but okay enough since you only need a small amount to cover your whole face. It applies more like a serum. Overall, I'm glad I tried it and will purchase the full-sized face and body sunscreens, but I will not be able to use the stick at all because of the glitter. * Love this little kit, great deal on the full size new product shimmer stick.  The added bonus of the small face sunscreen and the mii Sun Shield Gel which I already loved made it too good of a deal to pass up."
25,25,25,25,it cosmetics,hello sunshine invisible sunscreen for face spf 50,pimprod2044384,2623536," * Usually my skin breaks out immediately when I use sunscreen, but this has been FANTASTIC! I have dry skin and sunscreen usually leaves me feeling dried out and greasy at the same time. This does not! It's thin and easy to apply with a light & pleasant scent. It feels hydrating and doesn't leave a cast. If they ever discontinue this I think I'll just die. * I got a few samples from Ulta the other day and that's what I've been using for about a week and I love it even a bit better than my usual La Roche Posay. I love that it has a nice pleasant aroma. It makes it feel like summer ☀️ * I really like the it brand. 
But not the sunscreen lotion because it has fragrance added in the ingredients.  Such a Bummer. * I have been on the market for a sunscreen that actually performs well under makeup; unfortunately this one is not it. BUT it does perform well by itself and it genuinely is a great product, but only if used alone. It is a bit ""greasy"" and a little heavy. There is no white cast and its very hydrating. Unfortunately i wont be reaching for this again. * I have so much to say... i don't typically wear SPF under my makeup because they often are dry or pill and tbh i just don't have the time to risk that every morning. This however is a game changer! When i saw it was marketed as a primer it got me intrigued! I've been using this for a month now and i am still so impressed with the product. This leaves 0 white cast, hydrates + plumps my skin, gives the most beautiful glow, sinks in quickly, and never pills!! This is one of those i can't believe it's real kind of products. It's the only thing i want to use to prime my face now. I am a medium to full coverage girlie and this wears so freaking beautifully under my foundation. It makes everything look so radiant but not greasy! The photo attached is with the product on my face before foundation. This product was also sent to me in PR but there is no obligation to review it, i just think everyone needs to know how amazing it is lol * I have not yet tried it on make up but i put this on when I go out the house instead of normal sunscreen that smells * Bought this on a whim when I saw it by the checkout in Ulta. I had been on the hunt for a hydrating sunscreen. I was experiencing extremely dry skin with dermatitis. All of my sunscreens and makeup were irritating my skin more and looked terrible over the dry patches, no matter how hydrating they claimed to be. I had tried tons of expensive skin care, none of which was working. I don't know how, but wearing this for just three days under makeup totally transformed my dry skin. I'm not even using any other skin care right now, and my skin is the healthiest it's ever been. It also wears great under makeup if you have dry skin. If you have oily skin, steer clear. Dry skin girlies, this is your new holy grail!"
26,26,26,26,shiseido,clear sunscreen stick spf 50+,pimprod2022854,2576053," * This stuff is amazing. I have very fair skin that burns almost instantly. I recently used it on a disneyland trip and didnt get any sun burns! 
This morning i was doing yard work and grabbed for the stick but i was rushing snd i couldnt get an even layer on my shoulders (totally my fault its hard for me to reach entirely) and you can completely tell where i applied the stick and where i missed it (again my fault). This stuff is legit and is not greasy or sticky. * One of the only spfs I've tried that actually works and doesn't break me out. It's a little oily but once it settles into the skin that goes away. * I was really excited to use this for my face, especially when I have make up on. However I realized it was too greasy for my skin and though it didn't ruin my makeup if I applied on top, it did not sit well. My face would just feel oily all day. Now I just apply on my arms and legs and it's really nice because I dont have to get it all on my hands. * So easy to apply, it doesn't disturb my makeup when reapplying. The only tip
I give is to powder on top of it so your face doesn't look so greasy. This is the perfect spf. * An absolute staple! I have very acne-prone, oily, and reactive skin for reference, and LOVE this sunscreen! I garden a lot in the spring/summer, and its so nice to be able to reapply sunscreen without using your hands directly. Have used this for months with no breakouts. I have noticed that this gets into my eyes ONLY at the very very very end of the day (like 10+ hours), likely due to my oily eyelids haha — throughout the day, there is no stinging! The only con I could note is the high price; I wish sunscreens like this were more accessible for everyone as it helps protect from skin cancer. * This product gave me red bumpy skin. The first time I used it I thought something else caused it becuase I also tried new makeup that day. I tried again with no makeup and had the same thing happen. Horrible. I had prefectly clear skin and its been 5 days and my face hasnt gone back to normal. I do have sensitive skin, but thats why I bought a pricier product… * Its pricey but for me very worth it. I work in outdoors and I use this sunscreen every single day. I have very sensitive skin, and it has not given me acne or allergies and its not dried out my skin. I highly recommend for all of us that are constantly in the sun. Also highly sweat and water resistant."

Works so well. Very hydrating, goes on clear and actually works * I had been using this for almost a year. All of a sudden, I started getting itchy specifically on my neck everytime I'd use this. Then once it got so bad when I was on a plane mid-flight and my skin started to swell on my neck and face. I could barely open my eyes. It was frightening! I have no idea what in this did it, but beware. * I was using this spf for a while but I started noticing that my skin started to look red and my neck was all itchy. Then I went back to check reviews and I see I'm not the only. I will not buy this again. * This is a staple for me! I love that it feels lightweight, it blends in easily and it doesn't leave my skin smelling like sunscreen all day! This is my current favorite sunscreen rn and I truly like it more than a lot of high end sunscreens! I love to recommend this to friends and family bc I feel like it's a hidden gem that doesn't deserve enough love! * I was suprised to read the comments on this and see all of the negative ines. For me this is the perfect sunscreen. The perfect texture, easy to apply and no white cast. Leaves your skin glowy but not greasy at all, extremely lightweight but still moisturizing. I dont wear any makeup on top of it though so I cant speak to that, but I am a pale redhead and it has worked great for me all summer! * I don't usually put reviews but everyone's hating on this sunscreen. i don't use it under makeup but I've been using it every day and it feels nice and hydrating. i have acne prone sensitive skin but it hasn't irritated me. i have an olive complexion and if i rub it in enough it doesn't leave a white cast. i think it's pretty good for the price. i guess everyones skin has a different reaction to different ingredients so you just have to find what works for you"
28,28,28,28,coola,classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 50,pimprod2012268,2561101," * Its an anazing product. Snells anazing, and definitely fets the job done. My only negative is that its a chemical sunscreen. Great for occational use, but not a daily summer sunscreen bc of that. * My husband and I had the worst experience with this product today, so I ran to the reviews to see if others had a problem with it. Sure enough, others mentioned that they burned badly & quickly when using this product. We spent 1 hour in overcast weather, me wearing a long sleeve hoodie, before the sun came out and we decided to wear our T shirts and SPF. We were super confused when very shortly afterwards, we were BURNED!! This wasn't the most intense sun either. I tried to protect myself & my husband with this product and it caused more harm than good. 0/10, don't even risk it. * I used this sunscreen at the beach and didnt get sunburnt at all! I have very sensitive skin and burn very badly. It was easy to apply, not greasy, and fragrance free. My only reason for giving 4 stars is the price and if you go in the water it'll wash off immediately. But I would still buy it again for another beach trip! * The smell was so strong. It smelled extremely fake, like a chemical. I couldn't try it in the store, so I tried it when I got home and returned it the next day. 
It is not something to buy because it is easy to apply. * I just bought a bottle one month ago and it's empty. I dont over spray and maybe use it every weekend. it costs to mucj to go through it so fast. * I live in Florida and use sunscreens daily and never burn, I used this on a vacation and was burned silly. Could not hate this product any more if I tried. * this is my first time trying this sunscreen, it smelled great and didn't have a weird texture. did the job! pretty good amount for the price paid"

Smells really good and feels refreshing on the skin. I will continue to purchase all Supergoop suncreen products! * I'm a fair-skinned girl living in South Florida and need a daily sunscreen for my neck, arms, and shoulders that doesn't suck. This is worth every cent. I let my stepkids use it on their faces, necks, and shoulders - this is such a pleasant product to use and it's easier to set the example and get them started with a nice sunscreen. Smells amazing to boot. * I applied on a day i was in the sun for maybe 45 minutes and had a very slight redness to my chest and upper back. I applied it twice on a day i was in the direct sun for 4-5 hours and i still have a very minor ""sunburn"" on my chest. Im unsure how i feel about it. I like it because it does not smell terribly like standard sunblock * My family and I were left with a terrible rash. Will never use again. * I really am enjoying this. Good sprayer. Of course the SPF part works great! Dries  super fast after sprayed. Doesn't feel like you have anything on. Only thing I disliked is a super strong alcohol smell went it is first sprayed. Fix that and I would definitely repurchase. * I used this spray before going to Disney World for a very hot, sunny day, and also for whenever I go out, especially living in Florida, and it worked wonderfully. I felt I was well-protected, and it was easy to apply. I spray and spread everywhere I can, and the spray can be clicked-closed when not in use. 

The only issue is the price compared to how it can run out quickly, if you apply it daily or have multiple people using it. 

Btw, my body doesn't burn and gets dark-tan in the sun, but I still use sunscreen. So far, the spray does good at making sun much more bearable. :) Overall, would recommend. * I'm a bit tan and its hard to find sunscreen that doesnt make me look like a ghost but this has been amazing. I will say the only down side is that if you live by the beach sand will stick and its annoying90034"
31,31,31,31,neutrogena,hydro boost hyaluronic acid moisturizer spf 50,pimprod2028420,2587006," * not my favorite. its oily, and it has a not pleasant sun screen smell. I wouldn't buy it again. * Works well on majority of the face. However, my eyebrows and any contact with the under eyes was insane. Burning, itchy, puffy, allergic reaction type symptoms. Never have reacted to any product and I have had success with neutrogena and other hydro boost products. This one is a no for me personally. Could not continue using knowing the burning allergic reaction/chemical burn feeling on my eyebrows specifically. * This product is hydrating and does absorb into skin well if you rub it in well. It can look greasy and feel greasy because it tends to seperate in the bottle. It would be great but unfortunately it burns the heck out of my eyes, even when I try to avoid the eye area it still makes my eyes sting and water. It also taste like sunscreen. I dont put it on my eyes or lips but so how (maybe because its greasy and also bot sweat proof?) it makes its way to my eyes and lips. I will use it up but i wont buy it again. * I used this product on my oily acne prone skin and have had no issues so far. I personally have been loving the entire skin care line and highly recommend especially for oily. I would suggest using the entire line of products together because they make for a lovely product combination that makes your face feel very clean and hydrated. * Helpful to moisturize and sunscreen. Contains retinol as well. I would buy again. * let me just say this.. it is not good in my opinion. theres no white cast so thats a benefit. but it broke me out so bad and made my current breakouts very inflamed, and made my skin red and itchy. when i went in the sun it made my skin burn. * I was so excited initially because the idea of a moisturizer with spf 50 sounds amazing. But unfortunately it just doesn't work with my skin. I'm noticing tiny breakouts, it makes my skin look greasy, and I have tried to apply makeup after using and it just goes on horribly and the sunscreen will pill like crazy with or without makeup on. I you have very dry skin and don't wear makeup this may work for you, but unfortunately it doesn't work for me."

No matter how much i shook it it would not mix back together. * This sunscreen leaves the most beautiful glowy finish and smells SO good! I love using this whenever I'm on vacation since it doesn't feel like sunscreen and look so amazing on the skin while still protecting with SPF! * It's gorgeous going on, but after application you are very greasy until it sets, then you are sticky. I apply it when before I get into my suit/clothes so I can get it everywhere. You also want to shake the bottle vigorously first before dispensing so you get adequate protection. However it's not water resistant at all, which is disappointing, and I was hoping the rose gold would add a hint of color to my skin... it didn't. I did not apply this to my face as I'm too sensitive. This might be fine to wear in not strong sun but in direct sunlight... I was only in direct sunlight for a little over an hour and still noticed redness on my chest (I was also swimming). If you are sweating or swimming this is a no go. * I love this brand, however, as pretty as this SPF is and even after reapplying pretty consistently, I still got sunburnt. Did not do its job other than make my skin shimmery which I didnt necessarily hate, but again…this ended up being more of an aesthetic purchase. * Great scent, great texture, longevity- all wonderful! The only downside is that the shimmer is pretty minimal, and the price is steep. Got it on sale and would definitely repurchase! * This subscreen looks like and I wanted it to work, but it did not.  I applied very liberally and consistently, and each time I used it I ended up with sunburns. I dont think this formula is effective. I got caught up in the allure of it from ads and it looks ""cool."" * I bought this product thinking that it would be great. This product is not water resistant so it sweats off in your eyes and burns. If you touch your legs or arms, the product gets on your hands and when you rub your face or eyes, it just makes it burn. The product does work as a sunscreen. It just stings the eyes and gets all over your hands and you can't get it off because it's oily."

But it is irritating and burning my eyes, even when I don't apply it anywhere near my eyes. I look like I cried all day, not cute. * I honestly appreciate my friend who is a esthetician and recommended me this sunscreen. I am on a trip to Cancun at the moment and I know the uv rays do not play! It really is the best sunscreen ever! * I love how easily this absorbs and isnt greasy at all. It is very gentle on the skin and when used on my face, no breakouts. However unless this is on sale it is not worth the price. Even at half off its a little expensive. There are other products that have the same positives but a fraction of the price. * The best sunscreen brand I've ever used. It has more types of sun protection than other brands. * I used this spray for one day out at the pool, and it ran out while I was reapplying it the 3rd time. The price is not worth it for one day. Just get the liquid one and rub it in, either way this one sprays white and you have to rub it in eithet way. * Sprays white foam but great to use before applying your makeup if you want a dewy look * I am extremely fair , while my husband has a darker olive skin tone. We wore this out for 2 hours ( i re applied 3 times my husband once) and both of us got extremely burnt. ( my husband normally never wears sunscreen 🙃)I bought this as a reef safe sunscreen and will not be repurchasing. Never in my life have i had a sunscreen that simply didnt work. I bought the one for face and had NO ISSUE."

It doesn't feel like sunscreen and it blends into my skin beautifully. Definitely worth trying!! * An associate recommended my this sunscreen last year and I've been using it since! I can't comment on pilling since i stopped wearing foundation and concealer, but I do have sensitive acne prone skin and this has never broke me out. This is my go-to! * I've used this in the past and it worked fine. I think i put the sunscreen a little too close to my eyes because i must've sweat which made it run into my eyes. My face and eyes were swollen for 3 days and now my face is constantly extremely dry and flaking everywhere. I'm now frequently exfoliating and moisturizing my face to get my skin back to normal. Made my vacation in the Bahamas pretty miserable * I love using this sunscreen when I dont wear my tinted sunscreen. This sunscreen doesn't leave a white cast. It goes on smoothly. Doesnt burn my eyes. Safe to use on the kids. My husband who burns red like a tomato uses this to go fishing and doesnt get burnt at all! We use this and the spray for our disney trips and we dont burn! It doesnt run down when you sweat either! * I have tried many SPFs but none hold a candle to the Coola fragrence free 50 spf. It needs about 20-30 min to soak in to your face to avoid makeuo pilling, but as long as you wait, your make up will go on very nicely over top. (My skin tends to be on the dry to normal side, not sure how well it would work if you're oily) * Great product. Not greasy. Highly recommend. * This is my absolute favorite sunscreen I have ever tried. It doesnt pill, sting eyes, or have a white caste. It feels light weight on the skin and has never broken me out. Only downside is the price. Regardless, I'm on my 3rd tube."

It has Phenoxyethanol which is a very toxic chemical. Im looking for an all mineral 20% or more, no aluminum or toxic ingredients and very moisturizing. Its not easy to find. I can even put up with a tiny bit of white since makeup will hide that. Also it cant be expensive. I know thrres must be some out there somewhere. Pass on this one! * It has a thin consistency so it's easy to apply and doesn't feel heavy in my skin. It leaves a little shine but I don't feel like I need a ton of powder to cover it. It has a strong fruity scent that I don't love but is okay. * I love all vacation products and this is no exception. It works so well for a day out in the sun! * Love love Vacation as a brand and everything they have in their line. I've been looking for a spf that doesnt leave a white cast, its light weight, and doesnt leave me looking oily. While the SHAKE SHAKE does leave me with beautiful sheen glow, it also leaves me a white cast (for reference, i am ""light medium neautral"" in tarte shape tape) and it just never settles or goes away the sheer white cast it leaves behind. I wanted to love this product just like the rest of their products, but sadly i'll have to return mine. * I really love this sunscreen! it goes on smoothly and blends into the skin reqlly well. it's fragrance free but smells good.

only reason I gave it 4 stars is the spout makes it leak if it's upside down or in a bag. had this leak in my purse. please change the packaging to include a lid and this would be 5 stars! * Took it swimming with me and all of my friends loved it over any other sunscreen we had with us. We only used it for our faces (obviously) and we used some spray sunscreen for our bodies. I love the packaging and the slight smell it has to it is not bad at all. I also noticed that it didn't burn my eyes at all, which is something I usually look for in sunscreens since so many of them do burn your eyes a little once you get in the water. Will definitely continue to buy. * I have extremely sensitive skin and immediately broke out into hives after using this. 
HOWEVER, the formula is really nice. It went on really smooth, no white cast, and felt amazing on my skin for a second. The smell is pretty strong but quite pleasant. 
I really liked it for a second but my skin is just way too sensitive."

This dries down matte at first but within an hour or so is super greasy and makes my face very shiny. For the price I expected better. * I tend to find most sunscreens to be greasy, oily, or sticky even when they claim otherwise. I assumed this would be the same especially since its a sunscreen moisturizer combo. However I was wrong!  The texture and finish is so so lovely. It's very lightweight and glides on nicely, moisturizes without leaving me feeling like a shiny greasy mess! It's perfect under make too. Highly recommend! * It is weightless but it burns yours eyes terribly when you go to take it off ...and it's not sweat proof...for the almost $50 this is I expect more out of a spf moisturizer. There are drugstore brands that can offer the same for a way less price point. Definitely returning. * For some reason, every other facial sunscreen I've tried either made my face red and hot, had a sticky texture, or made my skin bumpy and textured afterwards. This is the only sunscreen without any of these issues! It feels like a regular, lightweight moisturizer in every way, and washes off easily without any texture or stickiness. * I love this moisturizer! it's super lightweight and there's no strong spf smell. it doesn't feel like i'm wearing anything and it doesn't break me out at all (like most sunscreens normally do) * Unfortunately this is a miss for me. The texture is that of a mild moisturizer, which is great, but the chemical filters in this sunscreen leave a lot to be desired. It has a sunscreen smell that lingers, and also stings my eyes. * The formula was a bit thick and strong smelling for my liking. For moisturizers, I need a thinner formula or else I get greasy really easily as someone with oily skin. In addition, I use the supergoop sunscreen and I feel like that provides a better base to prep my skin than this."

Cons- not water proof and cap cracked and disintegrated with the heat and oil. * The packaging is beautiful but it's glass and that is kind of pain to handle. It's VERY VERY oily. It's a slick oil like the Hawaiian Tropic oil. So you cannot touch anything or sit on anything besides a towel once applied. Have only tried it once and it maybe gave a color boost but nothing too crazy. Would probably love it if it were more of dry oil. It's a little pricey for just a tanning oil with an SPF. Many other products out there that do that same for less money and more ideal packaging."

what I'm really disappointed is the sunless tanner aspect. honestly I can't see it at all - not even when I put a really thick test spot dot on my wrist. (I'm pale, so tanner usually shows up on me well.) I may try adding self-tanning drops before applying, but that extra step is a bummer. 
so this stuff is ok, but it's not the 3-in-1 product I was hoping for. I don't think I will buy this again unless they make some improvements. * This will stain any light colored bathing suits you have and it applies streaky so you have to spend a lot of time applying it to prevent streaks. Do not recommend!! * I bought this as a substitute for australian gold tinted suncreen. Not quite what i was looking for! Very thick and pasty, hard to rub in evenly. Does cause streaks and patches if you're not careful. * First off, it stinks. I was self conscious about the scent, telling everyone around me that im wearing a stinky sunblock. It dosent sink into the skin. I tried rubbing it in my skin but it goes on like a cheap foundation and comes off once you get wet or if any clothing touches it. However, it did rub in to bikini and towel. It turned my yellow bikini streaky brown. I tried washing it out, didnt come out. Permanent stain. The sunblock washed off my body leaving a smell, and I didnt even turn brown. * This product was a complete waste. It's so hard to rub in. So dark and streaky. After laying by the pool every drop of water removed the color. Then I showered at the end of the day and it just all came off. Didn't leave any color - just a messy waste * For the price and extremely small packaging i was hoping for more. The scent is nice and you get an instant bronze color. But it's hard to rub in and is very streaky. I had to use a lot of product to cover my whole body. Definitely not worth the price. * I was so excited to try this. How in the world are there so many positive reviews? First of all, it smells terrible. There's this weird fakeness to the smell that never dissipates. Secondly, it's a brown/orangey colored, thick cream (think old school foundation before makeup companies got a clue) and it applies just like that 1980's style foundation. Lastly, it transfers onto EVERYTHING. Even after applying it long before sweating and being in the sun, it still got on my swimsuit, clothing, towel, etc…I looked like a streaky mess. I can't imagine using this with expensive swimwear or clothing. I'm 100% looking to return it."

The pump is amazing - loved it for putting lotion on me and the kids before we left the house.  Everyone would comment on the wonderful beachy scent (banana/coconut). * I love this sunscreen! It's not too greasy, easy to apply, and protected me from sunburns. Smells amazing too, just like summer. * While this absorbs super fast and is very lightweight, after being outside for an hour and a half, I still burned. I use the regular SPF70 all the time and swear by it but I won't be using this particular product again. I think it's great as an everyday moisturizer with minimal sun exposure but if you are spending any length of time outside, use the regular sunscreen. Don't be a tomato like me * I used to wear another brand of daily sunscreen and it was discontinued. Thank you Sun Bum for developing this product! It is perfect! It is not thick and heavy like most sunscreens and it does not irritate my sensitive skin. The lotion absorbs well and smells great. * I've been looking for a body sunscreen that I can wear daily, but many body sunscreens left a sticky, greasy film that felt uncomfortable on the skin. This, on the other hand, is moisturizing but not suffocating, and most importantly, it blends in with ease. It is good for dry weather and if you want that dewy glow."

The sizes of the products are pretty reasonable. The ""Unseen Sunscreen"" is very soft and silky. None of the products leave my skin with white cast or oil and grease. My skin feels amazing after using this product. I would recommend this set or even the full size of all these products. Over I would recommend this! * Cheap way to try 3 sunscreens! Loved both the lotions but wasn't a big fan of the spray. It felt greasy. * Not worth the price.  I can get a larger size in a less expensive brand. Not happy * I love the sunscreen but the mister didnt work. Plus the sizes are so tiny. It's better just to buy the big size items. * Love this Supergoop starter kit. None of the products pill which is great. Would buy again * I love this sunscreen kit. I feel like it's a great way to test if you'll like the product. My fave by far is the unseen sunscreen.

I don't know how to explain it. it's unexplainable and unimaginable. * The spray burned quite bad but I do have sensitive skin. It also made my base flaky and overall not look good. You gotta cover your hair when you spray too because it made mine feel gummy. It was worse than when you put normal sunscreen on your hair. Though I can't say much about the sun protection since I've only used it for mostly indoor events. As for holding makeup in place, it wasn't outstanding either. I would say there's much better out there. * I liked that this product is small enough to carry in purse/backpack to reapply.  I liked that it was in a spray bottle which would make it easier to apply over makeup.  Unfortunately, as soon as i applied on my bare face it irritated my skin and left redness all day. I wouldn't recommend to people with sensitive skin * Its super easy to use and takes 5 sec to apply, which is so convenient. However, having oily skin, it does make my face greasy soon after I apply it. * Honestly the spray has poor coverage mist-wise and reeks so badly of alcohol. On top of that I have dry skin so I will not be repurchasing for myself. Poor fidelity in application. * This product is easy in a pinch, is portable, helps with reapplication but it runs throughout the day. Without fail my eyes are super irritated. They get red & watery & I can barely keep them open which is concerning. * I used this product before going to an amusement park. I followed the directions and sprayed about ten inches from my face with eyes closed. As soon as I began to sweat a little it immediately got into my eyes. I washed all my makeup off and flushed my eye out but it still burned for about 6 hours until i could finally get some eye drops. If you are sensitive to sunscreens do not buy this product. Not to mention, all my makeup absolutely melted off about an hour after applying, which is not typical for me."
43,43,43,43,sun bum,face mist spf 45,pimprod2021621,2575599," * Been using this for a couple months on pool days and on a vacation to Cabo. I love this because it is a mist that can go on over your makeup and places like hairline where other sunscreen forms arent ideal. 
My fav sunscreen mist! * I love how this spray is such a fine mist it can go on vare skin without feeling greasy or sticky and it goes on beautifully over makeup to make sure tour skin is protected no matter where youre going! * I like the mist of this product. It doesn't leave you white like other sunblock. I personally use it on my body vs my face as I already use my daily SPF face lotion. (My toddler and husband use on their face). The smell isn't overwhelming either. * I usually love all of Sun Bums products but this was a no for me! first the packaging is cute, but it is flimsy and the spray nozzle leaks and feels like it's barely hanging on. The sunscreen itself left me greasy and kept running into my eyes and making them burn. The smell was nice, though! I've been using this to spray my scalp and my kids scalps where their part is so that doesn't burn, but I don't want to put this on my face anymore. * The directions say not to spray directly onto face. Why is the name of the product Face Mist? The point of having an spf face mist is so that you dont have to rub it in and can spritz it over make-up. I love so many Sun Bum products, but this is pointless. * I really like this face mist! Its easy to apply, and i personally love Sun Bum's signature summer scent. My only issue with this sunscreen is that it makes my face look really greasy, no matter how many times i pat it in, so i cant really use it as an every day sunscreen over my makeup, because i prefer a matte look. But this is a great one for those non-makeup days by the pool! * I don't like the feel of it on my face."

We took this to the beach last weekend and tried it - all of us got blistered AND the product made our hair really disgusting afterwards. Hoping to return and refund. * This spray works perfectly for those who burn easily and want to protext their scalp. This kept me from burning and it smells great. I do with the bottle was bigger because it is more expensive so I wish you got more product * I got this to use on my toddler blonde thin hair. It worked but completely changed his hair to light brown. * It works for an SPF, but dries out my hair. Too expensive for the size. I would recommend Sun Bum even with the defective nosle. * I'm constantly dying my hair crazy colors and need all the protection I can get! I just recently found this brand and I'm in love. It is a little bit on the pricey side, but I'm always willing to spend it if the product works! I bought it for vacation for 115 degree weather and swimming and it worked like a dream. It protected my entire head, kept my color from fading from chlorine, smells fantastic, and didn't feel oily/greasy or anything! * This is a great sunscreen for my scalp! I have hormonal hair thinning and don't always want to wear a hat. This goes on very evenly and gives all day protection. It doesn't leave my hair feeling sticky, stiff, or greasy. 10/10 will buy again and again!"
45,45,45,45,vacation,shimmer oil spf 30 sunscreen,pimprod2045400,2623027," * i'm so sad, i had such high hopes for this shimmer oil but it's caused such a bad reaction on my arms so ill have to return it. i wish i could upload a photo of the hives. * This is a lovely product!  Admittedly, Vacation is my favorite suncare brand, with a few others close in line.  I was both intrigued and worried about this product.  I think it was exactly one day before I noticed that  Ulta had it available that I saw a Vacation ad showing a glowing, darker skinned goddess, which I am not.  Looking at it in the bottle after it came in the mail, I was a bit concerned I was going to look like a gold version if the tin man from The Wizard of Oz.  So not the case.  This is subtly beautiful.  In the sun, the flecks of gold can be spotted; however, it's not garish in the least.  You can't even see the sparkle without sun or light reflecting on the skin.  I'm so happy I gave it a chance.  Smells divine, like other Vacation suncare.  My skin feels soft after applying—there's zero oily feel, and you absolutely cannot feel grit from the ultra fine glitters.  While it looks and feels like a luxury cosmetic product, it has the added bonus of sun protection. * This is summer in a bottle. 

Gives you that golden Miami glow and smells like tropical sunscreen. 

Wayyy better than the Tom Ford one!"

But how can you call it tinted? It literally leaves no tint at all, (I have light skin) which is fine because it blends so well. Just an FYI. * THIS IS THE BEST! My biggest complaints with sunscreen is oily feeling and makes my eyes burn. This is the only SPF I have ever found that works under ANY makeup. I have no compaints!!!!! 10/10 * I loved this sunscreen until people started asking me what was on my face. It piles up in your hairlines and the crevices of your face with an orange line. People literally asked me if I had mustard on my face. I even tried to blend it out with a makeup brush after appluing and it didnt help. Genuinely so bad and a waste of money. * I am picky about SPF for my face so many other brands are super heavy.  This is lightweight and feels good on my skin. I have no opinion about whether this would work for a primer because I don't wear make up very often and when I do it has SPF already in it.  I put this product on top of my face serum and moisturizer and it feels great * Absolutely love this product, I apply this everyday in the morning, does well with my other eye creams and moisturizers, for the girlies with acne this is safe for you, did not cause me any breakouts while using this product although I do occasionally suffer from cystic acne, doesnt leave skin greasy after applying or throughout the day, 
I absolutely will be repurchasing this spf all summer! Ps. their tinted spf are great as well. * This is awful, weird coverage, the only people who just LOVED this are the ones who got it for FREE. I paid for mine and returned it. * This product sits on top of my akinnit does NOT absorb into my skin. In addition it stains on clothing and whrn you sweat and you eipe it stains orange. Wouldnt recommend tvis item."

It gives me a natural glow and is so hydrating! The scent is not too overpowering and it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy. I use this product every day and I'm only on the second bottle(1 bottle literally last FOREVER). 10/10!!!!! * I have been using this product for the last 3 months and I absolutely LOVE it!! It gives my face a natural glow and feels so hydrating! The smell is also not too overpowering and a bottle last a while. 10/10! * I have medium deep to deep skin tone (depending on the season) and I was looking for something more then just a regular sun screen. Ive been using this for some years and really like it. 

Though the product come out white, once worked into the skin its clear, blends well, and doesnt leave a white cast. I personally think it leaves a little glow to the skin. Initially putting it on i feel like i can feel it on my face, but after a few minutes I dont. I also have oily skin and this doesnt make my skin feel and look more oily. A little goes a long way. 

I would say it works well under makeup, but not to apply primer and makeup until its dried and settled into the skin a little first. * Love this sun screen. Doesn't leave a white cast on your skin. Looks great under makeup. Leaves skin soft, not chalky. * I live in florida and have oily sensitive skin. I've been using this sunscreen for over a year now because its the only one that does not burn my eyes and makes my skin super glowie. It does feel greasy on the face, but that wears off throughout the day and its very hydrating. I have worn this under makeup, but as long as i set it properly i have no issues. I love this product and highly recommend. * This product is so good. I love that it is very light weight and that it also does not have a distinctive smell. Most of the old sunscreens I have used always leave white on my face or just don't blend well and this one does none of that it is so soft and light weight. I will be buying again and I want to now try the spray.
Also love a black owned business!!!! * I got a bottle about 4/5 months ago and im just running out, i use this everyday even if im not going to be out much and my skin looks and feels great. I get really bad sunburn and so far Ive kept my skin in tact and one color :)"
51,51,51,51,vacation,chardonnay spf30 lip oil,pimprod2043687,2620560," * This is honestly the best lip oil I have used in such a long time. Its lightweight, smells so good, moisturizing, plumping, protects against sunburn. Overall amazing * The scent was biggest holdback on this, but after trying it, i can live with that. You can't smell it when it's on, but it tastes great! 
That aside, i looove this stuff! Within the first couple uses, i love the way it feels and plumps. It's not sticky snd just the right amount of gloss. 10/10 recommend, this is my new favorite untinted oil. 
But if you absolutely can't stand vanilla and carmel smells, its prob not for you. * This gloss is smooth, smells nice, and doesn't have a sunscreen texture like most spf lip products. I'm honestly so excited about this brand and this is the first product of theirs that I have tried. * As others have said, it smells terrible. Like blue cheese. I thought mahbe someone had tampered with the one i bought in store until i looked up the reviews. I was expecting Vacation's signature scent if anything! * This is one of the best feeling and tasting lip oils I've used. Super light weight and isn't super shiny. My only problem is that to me it smells like burnt vape juice. Besides that though its great and it tastes nothing like how it smells. * This is one of the best feeling and tasting lip oils I've used. Super light weight and isn't super shiny.

Does NOT work!!!! Went camping and had the family use this spf and we all ended up burnt! I take sunscreen very seriously and this the first time with any that hasn't worked! Not worth it!! * I don't know what was in this sunscreen, but I was really looking forward to a convenient spray SPF. I put it on my forearms and neck in late morning and was put off by the scent, but brushed it off. Later that night, I noticed small, red pinpricks all over my arms. I woke up the next morning and the dots had become red bumps, and were noticeable over my neck, looking similar to acne. As of now, about 36 hours later, my arms are still covered in bumps, though they are no longer red. I have no known allergies, so I don't know what caused this reaction. All this to say, I have not enjoyed this experience, and the scent is unpleasant anyways. * I don't know if the stinging is pertaining to this product or just spray spfs in general because this is the first spray I've ever used. I used an entire tube of their spf & that one was great. Will purchase it again but the spray stings my eyes. I can barely open my eyes typing this. I spray it in my hand then apply to my face & neck. The smell is lovely. Wish I didn't have to throw it away & I can't return it as bought a while ago. My eyes hurt if I look into the light. It's just a shame as liked it. * unfortunately, this gave me a horrible (massive!) rash and the infamous scent was barely noticeable over the chemical aerosol smell. couldn't say if it actually prevented any sun damage because of how awful the redness and welts were from the reaction I had to this. * This is my new favorite spray sunblock. I like the smell a lot, it's very summery and fun. * I was excited to try this based on all the rave reviews. I guess the smell was ok. After getting out of the water, I found the product turned into a white film. Also pilled with reapplication. Can't say if it was effective against burning because I switched to another brand mid afternoon due to the pilling."

I decided to get a travel size but it is so small it's not worth the price so I returned it. * I wanted to love this sunscreen at first. I went a few days being okay with it since it gave a soft feeling on the skin. But after a few hours my skin would be oily. And after days i started getting bumps all over my face, mostly my forehead. This clogged my pores really bad. I know this didnt work out for me but i always recommended to ask for samples to try things out rather than just buying it. * This sunscreen broke me out and gave me bumps and milia all over my face and neck! Do not recommend. * This is my favorite sunscreen. * I love this product and buy again and again. * I have heard a lot of good things about this spf, so I have it a try.

Would recommend this p to my friends. * I have dry skin and most of the products are absorbed, but this sunscreen doesn't absorb into your skin and it looks very very oily as if you're sweating or something. I guess you can use this for your cheeks as a highlighter or something but def not for full face. I just love that it has no white. I'll try unscreen next. * It's sheer and my skin glows when I wear this. * I love how big the cap is so it's easy to remove and recover when your hands are slippery from lotions or water. Boyfriend has eczema and has stolen this from me. He use it every day. * I love how easy it is to apply this. I usually don't wear make up in the summer so that's when I use it the most. I wouldn't recommend wearing this with make-up bc of its consistency. Def give you a glow! * I love this sunscreen. It goes on very smooth and is not noticeable, it feels smooth and natural.

If you are putting on the recommended amount, then you will get a bit of a white cast. It also can be hard to rub in. It has a decent satin finish. Not sure I will repurchase though. * i was scared to try this sunscreen but it doesn't make my skin oily and amazing for acne prone skin, takes a while to blend in tho for darker skin * I hate the smell of it!!! It kinda smells like burnt plastic. I love how it feels on my face. It blends in perfectly fine with my serums/ moisturizers. Also great under my make up. No white cast.

Smells great and made my skin look great. So far, it feels protectant against the sun. * I LOVE this product. I literally cannot stop talking about it whicu may sound dramatic.. but it's that good. I hate lotion sunscreen and I find that the spray sunscreens either run out so quickly or are tricky with coverage. I will never buy another type of sunscreen besides this. I have not gotten burnt once using it and have gotten a beautiful, even tan. Love love love it. * Scent is nice, rubs in easily, and a little goes a long way. Leaks everywhere.  Does not work as a sunscreen. Tried this 2 days in a row. Burned both times. * Great smell and works properly BUT I will not be repurchasing based on the cheap (but cute) packaging. IT LEAKS EVERYWHERE. So disappointing. * I hesitate to say this is objectively a bad sunscreen, but for me it never really felt like it absorbed completely. It left an oily film on my skin, so when I would lean against walls, tables, etc. it would leave oily marks. It also left oily marks on my clothes. I constantly felt like I'd fallen into a deep fryer. Maybe it would be ok if all I was doing was sitting on a beach/in a pool. The smell is just ok... not amazing but not bad either. On the positive side it doesn't leave any sort of white cast whatsoever. Just... oil. lol * I an a redhead and burn SO easily!! I decided to try this oil along with the vacation spray sunscreen on a boating trip (a redhead's nightmare)! I was on the lake all day and didnt burn at all!

I would always skip SPF if I was wearing makeup because  many of them I've tried, make my makeup break down faster throughout the day. I tried this one out after trying it out in the store and to me it absorbs like a dry oil, and I can't feel it on my skin after a few minutes. I haven't had any issues with my skin over producing oil while wearing this alone or under makeup. I hope they don't stop making this product! * This goes on really nice on my face. It literally glides on like butter without the greasy feeling. I like that it has shimmer but it does not show up on your face as glitter, it's more of a glowy satin finish. I haven't noticed any pilling on bare skin or with makeup. I've paired this with Bare Minerals tinted moisturizer and it looks great. When pairing with makeup i put it on before my makeup. * I thought I'd give this a try when it was on sale and so glad I did! I wasn't using any sunscreen in my morning routine at the time. Most sunscreens I've used are thick. This one goes on lightweight and gives a sheer satin finish. I love it! * I love this product. It feels like satin going on my skin. It is absorbed instantly.The scent is great and doesn't smell like sunscreen. I actually apply it everyday first thing in the morning. * Melts into my skin and is so sensitive and gentle. I use the face and the body. I love both. I get a little glow too! * This is one of my favorite face sunscreens by far! It goes on well snd geels great on! It gives a nice blurred effect on my face. * I totally recommend this product.   It was recommend to me by an Ulta consultant and I am so glad now I took their advice!

It is hydrating and works great to mix into my bubble moisturizer. It has a tiny scent to it, but its almost fruity to me. * I loved everything about this sunscreen from the texture, how it applies under makeup to the protection it gives. However, after I cleansed my face for the night, I suppose some of it went into my eyes and I was in agony for at least 2 hours. My eyes were super red and burning. I tried rewashing my eyes, and applying drops but nothing worked. If you don't have sensitive eyes then I envy you, but as for me, I will continue my search for a sunscreen that doesnt burn my eyes off. * i like this sunscreen, a few things though- feels like youre slathering olive oil on your face when you first rub it in. but once its absorbed it leaves a nice moisturized silky feel. it also smells kind of weird but the scent isnt strong and doesnt linger. my makeup goes on very nice over it! * a clear vaseline like texture sunscreen, trying to take better care of my skin as a pale girl who burns easily have yet to test it i rarely go outside but thats what summer is for, is kinda small but at least it doesn't peel under makeup * I heard this was a dupe for Super Goop and I was a little skeptical.

I've been using this at the pool at summer and It stays on even after a quick dip and doesn't smell trashy. I re-apply every two hours and have not burned once, and still come home with a wonderful suntanned-glow. * This stuff is very pretty and also goes on very easily, but do not use it by itself if you do not want to get burned. Definitely put on sunscreen first and then this on top so you dont get fried in the sun (like i did) * This suscreen smells so nice, isnt slimy or sticky, and adds a healthy looking gooe to the skin! 
It layers nicely with body bronzers and contouring without looking like an oily body builder tan. * Thankfully I didn't experience any allergic reactions- but there is zero shimmer / glow. 
None of the glitter comes thru when this sunscreen is applied. I also don't think it's that effective as far as the SPF goes. * Recently use for the first time and put it on my arms and legs, next day I woke up I had a rash all over. I do have keratosis pilaris so wasnt sure if I was just having a flare up but it started itching bad everywhere. Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin. * I reapplied this sunscreen NUMEROUS times during my three hours of sun exposure and when I say I burned, I mean I BURNED. I had to sleep with cold wash cloths on my body to get any relief. 
The product looks so pretty and smells amazing, but absolutely nothing could convince me to use this product again. I might've developed trust issues thanks to this sunscreen… it should come with a side of therapy because I may never be able to confidently purchase an SPF product again. Yes, I hurt that bad. * I applied this product and immediately had a reaction. My skin turned bright red and my skin burned. I have no known allergies and only had this on for 30ish mins. That night I had bumps that itched all over my arms and legs. I wish I took pictures because it was horrible. I never review stuff but stay far away from this product."

But it is irritating and burning my eyes, even when I don't apply it anywhere near my eyes. I look like I cried all day, not cute. * I honestly appreciate my friend who is a esthetician and recommended me this sunscreen. I am on a trip to Cancun at the moment and I know the uv rays do not play! It really is the best sunscreen ever! * I love how easily this absorbs and isnt greasy at all. It is very gentle on the skin and when used on my face, no breakouts. However unless this is on sale it is not worth the price. Even at half off its a little expensive. There are other products that have the same positives but a fraction of the price. * The best sunscreen brand I've ever used. It has more types of sun protection than other brands. * I used this spray for one day out at the pool, and it ran out while I was reapplying it the 3rd time. The price is not worth it for one day. Just get the liquid one and rub it in, either way this one sprays white and you have to rub it in eithet way. * Sprays white foam but great to use before applying your makeup if you want a dewy look * I am extremely fair , while my husband has a darker olive skin tone. We wore this out for 2 hours ( i re applied 3 times my husband once) and both of us got extremely burnt. ( my husband normally never wears sunscreen 🙃)I bought this as a reef safe sunscreen and will not be repurchasing. Never in my life have i had a sunscreen that simply didnt work. I bought the one for face and had NO ISSUE."
62,62,62,62,coola,piÃ±a colada classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 30,pimprod2012272,2561103," * I am loving COOLA right now. This SPF is perfect for this dreadful Texas humidity and heat. It's very lightweight, non-greasy, and has a pleasant scent. Reapplying is a breeze since the product doesn't build up on the skin or cause a film. It's very breathable and works well with general skin sensitivities. The size is quite large for travel, but still small enough to throw in your beach bag and still have space for other necessities. It has a click-locking spray top so it doesn't accidentally spray in your bag. I will say that if your skin is very dry, you may want to go for a cream SPF because this does not provide much moisture. This is definitely made for hot, sunny summers. I love it and I know for sure I am buying a full-sized bottle to keep on hand.

***This review was collected as part of a promotion.*** * As a professional in the beauty industry, I've learned firsthand the  importance of sun protection, making COOLA's  spray an indispensable asset. In an industry where skincare is very important, COOLA stands out with its dedication to not only protecting against harmful UV rays but also enhancing the overall experience of sun care.

COOLA's sunscreen spray doesn't just shield your skin from UVA and UVB rays; Its broad-spectrum protection ensures comprehensive coverage, safeguarding against both premature aging and potential skin damage. As someone deeply invested in skin health, I love COOLA's commitment to providing a product that protects and cares for my skin.

The scent of Piña Colada fragrance is delicious. Gone are the days of sunscreen smelling like, well, sunscreen. Instead, COOLA's tropical scent transports me to my last vacation. It's a big change from the clinical smell of traditional sunscreens, making the application process a sensory experience.

I did not have any issue in my delicate skin but I always recommend  a patch test.

In my personal opinion, COOLA's in spray isn't just a sun protection product; it's an  evolution of skincare. With its comprehensive protection, anti-aging benefits, and irresistible Piña Colada scent, COOLA has redefined what it means to stay safe in the sun. So, whether I am lounging by the pool or hitting the beach, I make COOLA my go-to companion for summer adventures. And a big pus smells delicious! * The COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a delightful sun protection experience. Its tropical scent evokes visions of sunny beaches and relaxation, enhancing the application process with a touch of indulgence. The organic formula boasts SPF 30, providing reliable protection against both UVA and UVB rays, crucial for preventing sunburn and long-term skin damage. What sets this sunscreen apart is its lightweight texture, which absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. This feature is particularly appealing for those who dislike the heavy feeling often associated with sunscreen application. The spray mechanism ensures effortless and even coverage, making it convenient for reapplication throughout the day, especially during outdoor activities. Furthermore, the use of organic ingredients adds to its appeal for those who prioritize natural  products. 

 In conclusion, the COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a luxurious and effective sun protection solution for those who appreciate both quality and indulgence in their routine. * As a licensed Esthetician, we our taught early on how important using SPF to protect our skin. This aerosol is easy to use and smells amazing! If you have sensitive skin I would recommend spraying into your hands first then applying. I did have a slightly burning feel when I sprayed directly. But, overall I really love how cute and small and effective this spf is to use. My skin adapted the more I used this spf. * I love this sunscreen! Its perfect for travel and smells great. I used it almost all up on my recent vacation. It smells likea tropical holiday on a beach with a coconut. I would definetly recommend. I know the spf is quality and better packaged and easily portable. * This review was collected as part of a promotion. My name is Michele and I'm a Beauty Expert in my early 30's with fair combination skin. As the weather gets warmer, I have to make sunscreen a priority in my skincare routine. I am absolutely loving the Coola Clear Spray Body Sunscreen SPF 30 Piña Colada Sunscreen. I love its yummy, natural Piña Colada scent. It takes me away on a vacation to my favorite beach. This is a non-aerosol sunscreen that is so easy to spray onto your skin. It has a lightweight, lighter than air, mist texture that absorbs so quickly into my skin without leaving any greasy residue. I got the chance to try the full size 6 fluid ounce version of this spray sunscreen. This sunscreen is formulated with at least 70% Organic Ingredients. You get broad spectrum SPF 30 UVA and UVB protection. This sunscreen has water resistance that lasts up to 80 minutes so you can enjoy more time in the sun and water without worrying about reapplying every hour. With this amazing sunscreen you not only protect your skin but keep it hydrated too. Plant Protection is formulated with antioxidant rich nutrients which help fight free radicals, hydrates and nourishes your skin barrier too. Safflower Oleosomes is plant derived encapsulation technology that makes this formulation even more effective. Spray this sunscreen on your skin 15 minutes before any sun exposure. Make sure to reapply this sunscreen every 80 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone of any age who loves the sun and wants to have lightweight, long lasting and fast absorbing sun protection that also keeps your skin hydrated too. * Sun care is very important because it can help prevent skin cancer. I can't stress enough how important it is to wear sunscreen everyday. I was looking for a new everyday sunscreen and I think I found it. I prefer spray sunscreen than a cream so this one is perfect. It smells absolutely amazing and I love it! With most sunscreens they can get really heavy and greasy. I was really pleased that it absorbs really well on the skin and doesn't leave a layer of oil behind. Another thing I like is the ingredients, because I was having a hard time finding sunscreens that didn't have harsh or harmful ingredients. The Coola brand has organic and vegan ingredients so no worries about having harmful chemicals being absorbed in your body. So far so good and I would repurchase it."

You want to spray generously and not skim out on it. The scent is also not too overpowering. * Just no * Beautiful not greasy I buy this over and over try it you won't be disappointed * This gets everywhere oily. You absolutely cannot use it inside or your floors will be slick. I still burn reapplying this too. * Wore this, let it set, and got in pool. 15 minutes later I was blue from the pools paint. This thinned it, removed it, and stuck it to my body while destroying the pools paint. * It was working okay but after 3 weeks of using it almost everday I started to develop rashes. They were circular (kinda likr cigarette burns) reddish, and flaky. They get itchy sometimes. I know it is this product because this is the only new one I've used. Now I don't know what to do with all these rashes and skin damage I've sustained. * Great hand spray type top instead of those one finger kind of press button things. The hand grippy spray allows for easier application in hard to reach areas."

Just added a little lip gloss, some blush, and a dash of powder and it stayed the same all day. Would definitely recommend for a non-tinted sunscreen. I have oily acne prone skin and old scars. Nice ingredient list, too! * Super glowy and nice but the smell smells like a hangover * I don't have sensitive skin and have experimented with many problems. After using this for two day, my face broke out into red and clear itchy bumps. This was the only thing i changed and won't be using again. * I applied this, waited 30 minutes, went outside to do yardwork and burned terribly. Not woth the $$ or the chemical exposure. * I've been using this sunscreen on my face now for over a year and really like it a lot!  It definitely gives a slight glow and I can wear it under my foundation without any issues.  Smell is nice too.  I would highly recommend it. * I have bought several bottles of this and will continue to use. loooove the glow it gives. lightweight and moisturizing but not oily."

Theew it away immediately! * I love the OG unseen sunscreen for my face and its the perfect texture and viscosity. I was hoping this would be too. I hate the lotion texture of others so i was really excited that SG came out witb this. The only problem is that its just oily… it absorbs well and makes my skin feel REALLY SOFT but since i do sweat pretty easily it can feel a bit slick at times. Maybe its the olive oil in it? Or its just too many oils. * Goes on like silk and absorbs quickly. * This is a unique sunscreen. It slides onto my skin without an oily feel and immediately disappears like water. I like working in the yard. The Unseen Sunscreen Body enables me to be outside without getting a tan or sunburn in this hot summer sun. Other brands of sunscreen have felt oily and were a bit difficult to apply without some effort. The Supergoop! spread easily. It was a delightful surprise! * This sunscreen is nothing like the one for your face. It pills and rubs off with the slightest tension from clothing. It also remains slimy, so if you touch your skin at all, your hands get slimy. I threw it away, it's that bad. * The price may be high but this thing works like magic!  When it says ""Unseen"" it MEANS unseen. The sunscreen is smooth and clear on the skin. I didn't particularly smell a scent to the product but other people may smell something. It honestly did smell like a hint of regular sunscreen and wasn't strong at all. PLEASE don't by this if you want a waterproof or water reististant sunscreen. It is not either of these.  I do have quite pale skin and burn easily. With only a 50 SPF it is amazing. It is still a 5 star product that I would 100% purchase again. * The price may be high but this thing works like magic!

Plus this brand has a lot of great products. But the white cast is absolutely insane. After applying to my arms, chest and face I looked like a sickly victorian child. I will probably just use this for my small children this summer so I dont waste it. * Bought this for vacation after reading a few reviews. Have started to lean towards mineral sunscreen vs. chemical. It does a good job protecting however I felt it was drying and chalk like on the skin. Overall it was just ok. Personally I wouldn't rebuy * My partner developed an allergy to chemical sunscreen and finding a mineral sunscreen he likes has been really difficult. This sunscreen works great for him, provides full sun protection for at least a couple of hours and doesn't leave him with breakouts. Definitely recommend this sunscreen if you're limited to mineral sunscreen. * Product is basically clown makeup. Use even a teapsoon and your face has a huge white cast. As someone who resmebles casper the ghost in the complexion departemmt, I was susprised this spf made me even lighter. For those with darker skin tones, I would run away. Product is thick, difficult to apply, and greasy. After a while, it ends up drying your skin and is a whole lot of NOPE. * I liked it but at the same time I didn't. It leaves me white cast and takes time to absorb. I wouldn't recommend if you have mixed skin, it leaves oily sensation. * This is definitely a good sunscreen for those who are sensitive skinned or have problems with chemical sunscreens. I bought this after a long battle with dermatitis and it hasnt caused a flare like most others, but it does leave a HORRENDOUS white cast. I look like Casper the friendly ghost, and if i stand next to a white wall i could close my eyes and match it.
I do this this is an effective sunscreen that would not irritate sensitive skin types, but you will have a white cast no matter how hard you try to work it in, so be ready. * I used this product for a week before writing this review, but my final thoughts were the same as the first ones I had, if not worse. First of all, I wear the second lightest shade of foundation and this sunscreen had a HORRIBLE white cast that barely went away after hours of wear. It didn't massage in well either. I had to pat it in in segments so it wouldnt pull at my skin because it was so thick and drying. I haven't had problems with dry skin in 6 years but this product made my face and neck flakey! Even after double cleansing, exfoliating, and extra moisturizing, I was flakey and the white cast pilled on my skin. I'm so disappointed because I heard this brand was supposed to be great, and this product is not cheap. The pros would be that it didn't sting my eyes and you get a lot of product in one bottle. 
TLDR; I had to return this because of how bad the white cast and dryness was."

If I get anywhere near my eyes it somehow will work it's way into them. I keep it because it's a high SPF, doesn't look awful on the skin, absorbs well, and has a nice texture. 
But boy does it sting. I try to only put it up near my hairline on my forehead and slightly below my cheeks bones to keep it away from my eyes. Then I thoroughly wash my hands just in case. 
I also keep it away from my lips at all costs because it's got a lingering taste * Even if I don't rub the moisturizer around my eyes it still stings!! It doesn't soak into the skin and as the day goes rhe product starts to melt into my eyes and lips. It tastes soooo bad. * Wanted to love this so much! Not impressed :/ it has a wonderful texture, blends in smoothly, and leaves no whitecast! However it stings your eyes like crazy and kind of just sits on your skin making you look and greasy for the whole day. Was genuinely expecting a more elegant wear experience especially for the price. * Do NOT put this around your eyes. It stings worse than anyrhing i could imagine. My eyes are still so swollen. I had to pull over and rinse them out with a water bottle and they still wouldnt stop burning!! I wanted to love this product. It has a really nice texture and goes on smoothly, but this sort of eye sting is unacceptable. * It leaves my face greasy for the rest of the day and makes my makeup seem to 'sweat' off when I wear it. I'll be using up the bottle but for my body when I'm in the sun this summer. * I really like how it is not greasy and does not leave a white cast. I thought I found my go-to SPF, but I got red bumps on my forehead, and they were gone when I stopped using it. It might not be suitable for acne-prone and oily skin. * Wore it to go on a walk outside a few weeks ago, and it eventually got to my eyes it burned so bad. Really irritates eyes…the purpose of sunblock to avoid sun damage is to also apply it on eyelids or around eye area. Avoid applying around the eye area & thoroughly was your hands after applying if you buy this."

I used it daily for a 3 week trip throughout Italy during a heatwave and didn't get burnt despite me being fair as can be and outside the majority of the day. Will always buy again!!! * I purchased this product because the ingredients list showed that it did not include Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene. However, when I received the product, this sunscreen does include these ingredients which are NOT reef safe and is banned from parts of Hawaii. Will be returning. Please update the ingredients to include everything."
73,73,73,73,neutrogena,purescreen+ tinted mineral sunscreen,pimprod2037357,2606100," * this oily soup of a sunscreen should not be appearing in the ""CC cream"" or other searches for ulta. to say it's tinted is a farse, it is slightly in appearance to be non-white. it is also the oiliest, runniest cosmetic I have ever encountered. I have dry skin and couldn't even absorb it after many attempts at blending (which then eliminated any coverage it provided). the end feel was disgusting and greasy and it gave acne within 24 hours. also, the packaging doesn't seal well. in just one day it seeped out into my makeup bag. Just awful all around. * I got the medium-deep color and it is the most fantastic sunscreen I have ever found. I notice that my skin does not burn or significantly tan despite Southern summer heat, so I know it is working. Most sunscreens meant for darker skin have a much lower percentage of active ingredients and I worry I am not getting anti-aging coverage, but this one really has everything a darker skinned person could ask for. I recommend it to everyone with dark skin because not only is it an effective sunscreen, it also looks like a light foundation layer. I wear it when I have photoshoots and it looks great, my makeup artist agrees!

My only complaint is that I can no longer find it in stores like I used to, and I hope they will not discontinue it! * This sunscreen has a good shade range and is great for my dry, sensitive skin. Does not irritate my eyes or break me out, which many sunscreens do to me. * I found this on clearance & tried it over the winter. The Light shade was too light for me, in the winter, & I'm like NC 15-20 in MAC. The SPF 30 was ok for winter, but in the price range I expect SPF 50. The formula is almost greasy. I won't repurchase this & I'm really glad I didn't pay full price. * felt terrible on my skin and it brought of my imperfections * I would strongly suggest looking elsewhere for an SPF. 
I'm a pale lady, but the white cast is strong with this.
The packaging is atrocious and makes using the product difficult at best and messy as heck every time. The bottle cap leaks, the product is watery, and having a squeeze tube that is matte white is a bad choice. Just pure mess all around.
And finally, it breaks me out no mayter where I use it - face, neck, chest, or arms. * Disappointed. Chose this over my usual choice of CeraVe's tinted sunscreen and that was a mistake. The bottle leaks any time it's not upright. The formula is runny. Despite being tinted, it still leaves a white cast. Feels okay when it goes on but not worth the mess. Don't think I will buy again."

Otherwise it needs reapplied, which makes the product get used up fairly quickly. * Smells amazing and very moisturizing. The texture is slightly heavy—it dries down a bit sticky but gives a nice glossy look. I wish it was a bit lighter but love how it looks. The scent is enough make to make it worth it. * Wanted to try this subscreen out and was really disappointed that it separated almost immediately upon purchase. * I wanted to love this product, but it pills so bad!! I try to rub it in gently and it STILL pills up on my face and my body. I will not be repurchasing. * Its heavy, greasy and pills on your skin lioe crazy! * I feel like for the price the bottle is too small.

I used it while at a water park hoping to get my backside even and my legs to match my arms. This product has worked better then I could've ever imagined. It smells amazing, a little goes a long way, and it gets you a very nice even tan all throughout your body wherever you use it. I did go ahead and layer the product first having it as my base then a layer of sunblock and then I topped it off with another layer on top. If there was only one thing I could complain about, it would be the amount that you get for the price. While a little does go along way. I just don't know if the price offsets everything else. * The bottle is freaking tiny for 23 dollars. i shouldve looked at the ounces but the bottle just looked bigger in the picture. im not sure how good it is ive only used it once but it smells good * I don't waste my time writing reviews. But girl I need to tell you what just happened. So I am so pale, I know so sad. Okay, so I didn't want a tanning oil to give me a false tan, and ma'am when I tell YOU that I'm proud of this tan because I earned it. The oil smells so nice. I paired it with an spf 50, and I'm new to tanning and you best believe I burn easy. So when I tell you I TANNED. I feel so much better about the way I look. When I say it's only been 15 MINUTES, Jaw on the floor. Picking it up now because it is still devolving and I'm STILL getting darker. Like girl…my pasty self is getting darker? Yes…take my money agin because I'm getting another. I'm bummed I'm only getting like 7-10 uses out of it. But if it works it works. And I am working with this sun right now. Watch me be a bronze goodness by the SUMMER girl. 10/10 oil, you won't find anything better. I promise you that * I never write reviews, but i have to tell you guys everything about this. So i never bought oil before right, so i didnt know where to start. I was so afraid to burn or get a fake tan too like the other products. Oh my gosh guys, this oil works so well. It smells so good too. It doesnt give you a false tint or anything before hand and it will activally make you proud of your tan. I always hated fake reviews from insta or tiktok, but i found this one by myself and im so surprised it woked so well. Im super pale, and i never go out. The way it tanned me in one session..flabbergasted…immediately. I feel so confident. I pairded it with a spf 50, and the oil.  The oil gave me such an even and bronze tan. Its still forming curently. But this is within 15 MINUTES. Im so dispapointed the bottle is so small for the price. It will give me 7-10 sessions. But honestly its be worth it."

It has buildable coverage and it was just what I needed for sun protection! * Vacation summer must have! These bronzing drops have a serum like consistency making it super easy to blend smoothly with other serums & moisturizers. I like how this feels on my skin, it is light weight and does not leave my face feeling greasy. This pairs great under makeup or alone for a sun-kissed  glowy look while protecting your skin from harmful UVA & UVB rays! Ive been wearing it on beach and pool days and i absolutely love it! Definitely reccomend! * Vacation's Bronzing Drops offer a subtle, sun-kissed glow ideal for achieving a natural-looking tan without the harmful effects of UV exposure. 

The drops blend smoothly with moisturizers or serums, making them versatile and easy to use. The formula is lightweight, non-greasy, and enhances skin with a warm, radiant tint. 

While they deliver an impressive instant bronzing effect, the tint is temporary and requires regular application for maintenance. * This made my skin look like I had haphazardly rubbed dirt on it. And whatever is in it made my face break out in red, itchy blotches. * Hello Beauties, my name is Andrea. I am a beauty enthusiast.

I love being out in the sun, so suncare is a priority for me.

So, to find a bronzer that has skincare and suncare benefits to it is remarkable.

Vacation Studio Tone 3-in-1 Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Bronzing Drops for face is the perfect product it's not just suncare but skincare as well. It bronzes, nourishes, and protects skin from sunburn.

It gives amazing sun protection throughout the day and can even be worn in the night.

I must mention that the packaging is great. I love the dropper it is convenient and makes applying this product easy and mess free.

This bronzer applies nicely without sticky residue and is great for all skin types and skin tones.

This bronzer helps me to achieve the perfect sunkiss skin every time.

It has just the right amount of shimmer to give you that luminous glow and that satiny, dewy finish.

It can be used alone or layered under makeup without affecting my makeup application.

I absolutely recommend this product. Vacation Studio Tone is a must-have. * My honest experience review for this

It also caused my make up to separate even when allowing 15 minutes to dry before applying foundation. I've increased my moisturizer usage hoping that would help offset the dryness, but it has not helped at all. This sunscreen has an odd smell to it. * I've had such a hard time finding a face sunscreen that didnt mess with my skin or makeup and this is it! I'm obsessed with how easy it is to apply after my skincare and it was no issue at all with my makeup after application! It doesn't have a typical sunscreen smell. I will say, for someone like myself who had oily combo skin, this might be a hit or miss for you, but for myself personally I didn't mind it at all :) * My sister-in-law got this and I've always wanted to try it and have it my own and I love it 😊 * Smells terrible and goes on like flaky paste. Overall gross feeling. Very dissatisfied. * I've tried countless sunblocks, most of which caused me breakouts and I usually hate the way they feel on my skin or smell. This one is my GOAT. It layers well over my other skincare and makes a great primer for makeup. I always repurchase this. * I've lived an active outdoorsy lifestyle for many years and I have tried many sunblocks. I bought this on a whim and I'm so glad that I did! I use it everyday either on its own or under my makeup. I have light, sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. This product blends well over my other skincare and doesn't feel heavy. Its also beautiful under makeup. I'll keep repurchasing. * Took me a bit to get used to this product esp after using city block spf 40, but is now a staple in my everyday morning routine. It blends really nice into the skin after warming the product up with my fingertips. Thats the key is warming the prodcut up in your hands. I love how it has just a little tint to bring down redness; with a little concealer and transparency powder on top, it creates a beautiful finish!"

As a big fan and constant user of drunk elephant d bronzi drops, I was very excited to use this product! I decided to opt for the umbra tinte because I thought the bronze version might be too dark for my skin tone and I really like it!! It kind of doubles as a skin tint * I'm really impressed with this! It's light and non-greasy, so it goes on smoothly without a white cast. It's fragrance-free and gentle, perfect for everyday use. It's a bit on the expensive side, but the quality makes it worth it. This has become my favorite sunscreen!

complimentary from drunkelephant * Gifted by Drunk Elephant. Drunk Elephant Umbra Sheer Physical Daily Defense SPF 30 has become a staple in my skincare routine. This mineral sunscreen, with its 20% zinc oxide, offers excellent broad-spectrum protection while being gentle on my skin. I particularly love how lightweight this sunscreen is. It doesn't feel heavy at all, making it ideal for everyday use. The scent is mild and pleasant, which is a significant advantage for me. Plus, it's non-greasy, so my skin stays feeling fresh and smooth. What sets this sunscreen apart is that it doesn't leave any white residue on my face, unlike many other mineral sunscreens. It applies effortlessly and looks natural. Knowing that it's non-toxic and free of essential oils, silicones, and fragrances gives me added peace of mind. In summary, Drunk Elephant Umbra Sheer is an outstanding sunscreen that I highly recommend. It's effective, comfortable to wear, and safe for my skin – everything I need in a daily sunscreen. * Absolutely love this sunscreen! I was shocked that my skin did not look oily after spending all day in the sun walking at the zoo because it usually does look oily relatively fast, especially when I have sunscreen on. I got the Tinte shade and I really like the tint in it because there is no white cast to it. After walking in the sun all day long on a fully sunny day, I wasnt sunburnt AT ALL! Completely recommend because it looks nice on and did a great job protecting my skin. As an added bonus, it was gentle on my skin and didn't cause any breakouts * I have been using the Umbra Mineral Cream SPF 30 in replace of foundation and I have been loving it for summer! This product applies nicely with my fingers and goes on smooth. Definitely a go to product for the summer time! I also love how it's SPF 30. This product was offered by Drunk Elephant in the exchange for my honest review. * I like this sunscreen it didn't peel under my makeup and was super moisturizing! my only problem is the rink is wayyyy too orange. But i was able to make it work! i would love this even more if the tints to them were less on the orange side. also gifted by drunkelephant!"

It feels like a layer. However it is invisible which is a plus. * I tried this off and on for about a month and i love the texture of it and how it applies and it does hydrate for a little bit but after a few hours my face would be dry. The reason i had to stop using is because it caused skin redness and my skin would appear irritated. * Loved it. It's light, great quality. * GREAT PRODUCT FROM THE FIRST USE FEELS GREAT MY SKIN FEELS SOFT * Great face lotion. Highly recommend. super hydrated not greasy. No white cast.

Does NOT work!!!! Went camping and had the family use this spf and we all ended up burnt! I take sunscreen very seriously and this the first time with any that hasn't worked! Not worth it!! * I don't know what was in this sunscreen, but I was really looking forward to a convenient spray SPF. I put it on my forearms and neck in late morning and was put off by the scent, but brushed it off. Later that night, I noticed small, red pinpricks all over my arms. I woke up the next morning and the dots had become red bumps, and were noticeable over my neck, looking similar to acne. As of now, about 36 hours later, my arms are still covered in bumps, though they are no longer red. I have no known allergies, so I don't know what caused this reaction. All this to say, I have not enjoyed this experience, and the scent is unpleasant anyways. * I don't know if the stinging is pertaining to this product or just spray spfs in general because this is the first spray I've ever used. I used an entire tube of their spf & that one was great. Will purchase it again but the spray stings my eyes. I can barely open my eyes typing this. I spray it in my hand then apply to my face & neck. The smell is lovely. Wish I didn't have to throw it away & I can't return it as bought a while ago. My eyes hurt if I look into the light. It's just a shame as liked it. * unfortunately, this gave me a horrible (massive!) rash and the infamous scent was barely noticeable over the chemical aerosol smell. couldn't say if it actually prevented any sun damage because of how awful the redness and welts were from the reaction I had to this. * This is my new favorite spray sunblock. I like the smell a lot, it's very summery and fun. * I was excited to try this based on all the rave reviews. I guess the smell was ok. After getting out of the water, I found the product turned into a white film. Also pilled with reapplication. Can't say if it was effective against burning because I switched to another brand mid afternoon due to the pilling."

The size of the container was as expected and makes it super portable, but the amount of product was disappointing. I probably wouldn't have even realized how little product there was in the tube, but when I first opened the tube the product fell out exposing how much was really in there. I'm talking about a half an inch worth of product in the 3.5 inch tall tube… The packaging clearly says 0.7 oz, but you don't realize how little that is. * found this and said oh perfect! needed something to keep in my bag for sunscreen on long motorcycle trips. this is a great size teardrop shaped stick that goes on smooth and clear, smells really nice and light. definitely would recommend this to everyone! packaging is also on point ☝🏻 * The only way I will be applying SPF from now on! This sunscreen stick is pocket size, put it in your purse, beach bag… & your good to go. I love the way it feels on my skin, giving me a natural looking glow. Absolutely no white cast, as this goes on clear. I definitely reccomend! * The Vacations Sunscreen Stick is fantastic! It's compact and easy to carry, making reapplication throughout the day a breeze. 

The formula is smooth, non-greasy, and provides excellent sun protection. Plus, it has a pleasant scent and doesn't leave a white cast. Perfect for on-the-go sun care! * I'm absolutely in love with the Vacation Super Stick SPF 45! The edgy shape ensures precise application, and it makes my skin feels very silky smooth. It goes on clear with a beautiful satin finish that felt perfect under my makeup. As someone with oily skin, I appreciate that it doesn't cause any breakouts or extra oiliness to my skin. I highly recommend! * Hello, my name is Andrea. I am a beauty enthusiast and skincare junkie.

I love all things skincare and suncare.

I'm a outdoor person. I love the sun so sun protection products plays a big part in my everyday lifestyle and skincare routine.

Vacation super stick broad spectrum SPF 45 is the perfect amount of protection for those midday sun.

I love the packaging of this sunscreen stick it has that nostalgic look to it and the teardrop shape is genius it makes it so easy to apply the product around the nose and eye area.

This sunscreen glides on smoothly onto skin without leaving any sticky or white residue.

I absolutely love the scent of this sunscreen. It is fresh and clean. 

I've tried many different sunscreen before but nothing compares to Vacation super stick and the effectiveness of this product.

This is great for everyday use and it's small convenient packaging is perfect. I just drop it in my purse and I'm good to go.

I absolutely recommend this sunscreen. * Amazing cute spf face stick.

I love the smell.

Super cute I am in love.

The packaging is so cute and small but very handy or lightweight. 

I always carry it anywhere with me since I got this.

I love the mineral sunscreen. 

Thank you Vacation Inc for this nice spf product. 

I added it to my spf collections here.

I like how it's easy to put or apply it on my face.

It's not rough it's just very smooth and it glides so eady my face.

I like the color and texture as well the consistency very soft and strong .

I always go out under the sun, so this has been a life saver for me.

I like the spf 45 in it very good amount for a sunscreen stick.

I don't worry about getting burnt everytime I use it I am so confident and feel protected.

The ingredients in it are great and I could say that this product is amazing and high quality and worth to try or to have."

Would definitely use again in the future for body * This is the greasiest sunscreen I've ever used.  I hate it so much.  My skin stayed greasy for over an hour after applying.  This stuff is an oil slick. * This gives me a white cast at first but blends in quickly. Leaves a slight greasy feel but tolerable.

I decided to get a travel size but it is so small it's not worth the price so I returned it. * I wanted to love this sunscreen at first. I went a few days being okay with it since it gave a soft feeling on the skin. But after a few hours my skin would be oily. And after days i started getting bumps all over my face, mostly my forehead. This clogged my pores really bad. I know this didnt work out for me but i always recommended to ask for samples to try things out rather than just buying it. * This sunscreen broke me out and gave me bumps and milia all over my face and neck! Do not recommend. * This is my favorite sunscreen. * I love this product and buy again and again. * I have heard a lot of good things about this spf, so I have it a try. I have sensitive skin and the first day using it my skin would burn slightly. I tried to look past it, but it would leave my skin burning so bad after repeated uses."

I have oily skin and this just added even more to it. I loved the texture of it, but after applying it felt too heavy on my skin. This also has your typical sunscreen smell to it which is not horrible, but could potentially push people away. I kept going back to my EltaMD UV clear as it leaves a matte finish for me. I'm sure Kiehls would be great for people with dry skin! * I will forvere use this product. The serum texture makes it an amaing last skincare step. In love is an understatement. * Im a MUA of 20+ yrs. This is the first and best not only spf that doesnt leave a cast EVER but isnt thick or cloges pores, and forget about it being sunscreen it's ACTUAL SKINCARE!! Where has this been all my life, Im on my 2nd bottle and not only that but I broke my ankle and didnt use for 1 week and I had wrinkles on my forehead I never knew I had, started using it again religiously and I mean every time I'm outside every two hours like you're supposed to with SPF. And with the collogen and other delicious stuff afteIm 41 and look you ger than my 35 year old hus and and those lines are GONE AGAIN. How are there only 8 revies on this!! I get it its very exspensive for a ""sunscreen"" but if your not using 50 on  your face every 2 hours outside sun/shade your damaging your skin and it was only when I found this that I saw the significant difference. I have hyper sensitive skin and hated using SPF's before esp in combo with any skin care because it just never felt right on my face or had any benefits so always did both seperate. Never again!! I dont work or have affiliation with the brand or product it's just that amazing and I have to tell you it is worth every little penny please don't let the price tag scare you because what it will give you back will save you all the injectables. You do all the facials that you get it is truly mind blowing. I will never go without this and make sure I have an extra bottle before I run low. This is how I think…. Whats your skin/ youth looking face worth to you and too try it for free for 60 days and see the results or get your $$ back why wouldnt you!!! * Lightweight face sunscreen that doesn't leave a sticky, greasy, or opaque residue. Skin feels soft and nourished. After two wears, I feel like this will be a staple. Reasonable price is the icing on the cake. * This burned my skin!! Caused new breakouts only after 3 wears * I have sensitive acne prone skin, and over the past few weeks can say its my favorite! It blends in easily for me, sits well under my makeup (Water based makeup! Silicone pilled bad for me and left my skin feeling more dry) and it doesnt break me out. id choose this over Supergoop, Good Molecules, and any laroche posay ones as ive tried all different ones they have * Loved this product! You can't feel it in your face, It is super thin and I love how it leaves my face looking bright."

Applies with minimal effort to rub in after spraying on. Has the most mild scent out if all the products, probably due to the application process. It wirks so well. Full day of baseball camp, and my son had zero burns at all. Just a beautiful tan. Highly recommened this product. * I bought this for a trip to Maui with my husband. The bottle looks to be a decent size - a little smaller than your average spray sunscreen container. The product itself worked well. There was a slight white cast but it wasn't bad. It felt like it was stuck to our skin (in a good way) and definitely protected us from the sun. HOWEVER... The bottle literally lasted  us 2 applications each, so 4 full body applications total! And we are relatively small people. Is this a joke?? Good thing that was all we needed for our trip, but that's DEFINITELY not worth the money. Such a bummer!"
90,90,90,90,kinship,self reflect probiotic moisturizing sunscreen spf 32,pimprod2017785,2569946," * I love this sunscreen! It is one of the only ones I've tried that doesn't break me out. I have normal, but dehydrated skin that is fairly sensitive and acne prone. The zinc oxide in this sunscreen really helps calm redness and irritation in my skin and is somewhat hydrating whereas some sunscreens I've tried for acne prone skin were too drying for me. I used this for years and decided to try other sunscreens, but I ended up coming back to this one as others i tried just didnt compare. * It leaves a dewy sheen, has a pleasant smell, and did not break me out. For me, it was just too thick feeling on my skin, so I will be returning. But, I really do get why it's popular. * I have been using this sunscreen for a while (probably almost 2 years). I do mix in a little bit of tinted sunscreen from another brand, but can wear this on its own. The best things about this sunscreen are that it wears well under makeup and it provides amazing protection. My make up lasts just as long with this underneath, and does not change the finish. Sometimes I feel like it makes it look better. 

The protection on this is phenomenal. I went to an all day concert this weekend, and used this with my holy grail foundation that lasts through almost anything and for over 15 hours. I forgot to put sunscreen on my arms for the first hour, and got a little red even though I put sunscreen on pretty early. However, my face was not burned AT ALL, and I was in the sun a lot. 

I dont usually wear this one on its own, I usually wear a more tinted one if I am not wearing makeup, but this is my favorite sunscreen under make up, hands down, and the highest % protection out of any of my other sunscreens. Highly recommend! * I have been trying so many different sunscreens and so many i havent liked. The kinship is amazing and its great for dry skin. Works well with the vitimin C serum im uaong. I will definitely repurchase * I have tried so many sunscreens for the face. A lot of them are nice, but eventually break me out. The ones that don't make my eyes water, and make me look very oily. This sunscreen looks very nice on the face. It evens out my skin tone a bit, and moisturizes. It can be a little tacky, but the finish looks so nice, I don't mind. Some days I use a light hand and dust some setting powder over top. This gives a nice glow, while letting your natural skin tone shine through. Definitely give us a try. * This is my holy grail.  22.4% NON-NANO zinc and NO butyloctyl salicylate?  Amazing.  I have very sensitive skin, and the light vanilla fragrance doesn't bother my skin, but watch out for that if you are sensitive to fragrance. * I loved it"

There are much better options out there. * I've used this sunscreen for years but lately its been pilling everytime I apply it. No matter how I apply it. Did they change the formula? * I totally trust the Neutrogena brand.  This is a must for face SPF.  Doesn't sting your skin or eyes. * It stings as i put it on. Now, i have a very strong history of chemical burns around my eyes from the chlorine of the swimming pool (I swim competitively), but it stings always. It peels right off after you put it on if you are planning to put makeup over it. It is very streaky abd hard to rub in completely. It WILL leave white residue around your hairline."

The product is thick. I don't use it as a standalone sunscreen. I use it as a touch-up throughout the day. * It is rare that I leave a review since being experienced with so many products I have tried many tinted SPF that do not last and that  feel so greasy. It takes a lot to wow me, I've tried IT cosmetics, Dr Jart, Mischa, Supergoop etc. this is the best * Quality product . Easy for application * I have large pores and oily (summer) and combination (winter) skin, I have try so many skin tint spf product and this one felt the most comfortable. Blend well with one fingers and nice coverage when blend with the sponge that came in the compact. It also hold pretty well throughout the day, especially didn't budge around the nose area when i'm wearing glasses. The only biggest con is that the shade range are quite dissapointing. * medium coverage that does not irritate my rosacea. will be buying again * Ok, ok. I order the shade beige. For reference im a nc35, oily/acne prone. I was looking for something somewhat similar to SkinBetter compact spf. This does the job. It doesnt break me out, I also been wearing this on the go instead of a foundation its medium to full  coverage. It doesnt have any smell imo. The beige shade is touch light and a touch on the pink side. But once i put bronzer and blush it evens out. This makes my skin look airbursh too every time i had wore this people compliment me on my skin which is nice!  The only reason its not a 5⭐️ is the lack of shades. * This is my holy grail foundation over pimple, its a natural finish with some medium coverage and the light shade my perfedr summer shade. But the shade range is abysmal. I feel bad using this knowing it wouldnt work for 90% of peole."

But, my skin looks amazing with it. * I wore this a few times without a problem but got a bad rash on my forehead today. I had no other products on my face so it had to be this. It was very hot today so maybe the product causes rash at certain temps? Others have also experienced this rash based on the reviews and I never have had a reaction like this to another sunscreen or facial product in general. I would avoid this product * I like the product, but it leaves a white cast after applying. I don't think l will order this again. * I wanted to love this serum for multiple reasons. The idea of a glowy sunscreen that I could wear instead of regular sunscreen to give an extra glow for makeup was great. Reality not so much. I felt like when it went on it was so glowy that it just highlighted my pores? Also not positive but pretty sure this makes my skin breakout. I dont vary in my skincare but when I do to wear this…I break out. So maybe it is just a fault with my skin reacting * I wear sunscreen daily, even if I dont think I'm going to be in the sun so I've tried dozens. This is by far my favorite. It's amazing under makeup and I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear this that I've even started using it before my makeup at night! * Used this for awhile with no concerns, then started experiencing unexplained facial swelling & rashes. Spent $500+ at my doctor only to figure out on my own it's this product and now that I have read other reviews I see I'm not alone."

Where as a different brand of 30 spf protected me with zero sunburn in other areas! Sad because this was so expensive :( * This is not sunblock.

I used this on my 3 day beach trip and ended up super sunburnt! Seems like the spf didn't work at all and I'm really sad because this is so expensive. The only good thing about it is the smell. Other than that, it's overpriced and leaves you with no sun protection. * This makes my skin glow due to its somewhat oily sheen. If you apply too much, it can feel very greasy , so don't do that. The glitter is almost non existent for anyone wondering about that. If you don't like oils on skin, this isn't for you. The smell is fantastic, like a tropical getaway! My only gripe is the dispenser. Its too close to the bottle and can be a slippery pain once its on the hands. Still love it though. * I brought this for a cruise and was sadly disappointed. I did not mind the greasy/oily feeling. The lack of sun protection had my skin on f*re and I ended up with sunburn after reapplying. The shimmer did not last more than 5 minutes on my skintone. * I bought this because I figured it would smell good and sparkle unlike other sunscreen which it did, However it is very oily and was unpleasant. I did use it in Oklahoma for the first time and it was very hot that day so I figured that may have influenced the oiliness but who knows. It did protect my tattoos from the sun so I'd say it did its job. * I bought the travel size of this and went through this product ridiculously fast, within 4 uses as its a thin product and you need to apply it twice. I also thought the ""glow"" was more just a slight shine that could be achieved with any sunscreen. I'll stick with my traditional sunscreen because I feel like its just not worth the price for how quickly it disappears"

Sure enough, others mentioned that they burned badly & quickly when using this product. We spent 1 hour in overcast weather, me wearing a long sleeve hoodie, before the sun came out and we decided to wear our T shirts and SPF. We were super confused when very shortly afterwards, we were BURNED!! This wasn't the most intense sun either. I tried to protect myself & my husband with this product and it caused more harm than good. 0/10, don't even risk it. * I used this sunscreen at the beach and didnt get sunburnt at all! I have very sensitive skin and burn very badly. It was easy to apply, not greasy, and fragrance free. My only reason for giving 4 stars is the price and if you go in the water it'll wash off immediately. But I would still buy it again for another beach trip! * The smell was so strong. It smelled extremely fake, like a chemical. I couldn't try it in the store, so I tried it when I got home and returned it the next day. 
It is not something to buy because it is easy to apply. * I just bought a bottle one month ago and it's empty. I dont over spray and maybe use it every weekend. it costs to mucj to go through it so fast. * I live in Florida and use sunscreens daily and never burn, I used this on a vacation and was burned silly.

This stuff is legit and is not greasy or sticky. * One of the only spfs I've tried that actually works and doesn't break me out. It's a little oily but once it settles into the skin that goes away. * I was really excited to use this for my face, especially when I have make up on. However I realized it was too greasy for my skin and though it didn't ruin my makeup if I applied on top, it did not sit well. My face would just feel oily all day. Now I just apply on my arms and legs and it's really nice because I dont have to get it all on my hands. * So easy to apply, it doesn't disturb my makeup when reapplying. The only tip
I give is to powder on top of it so your face doesn't look so greasy. This is the perfect spf. * An absolute staple! I have very acne-prone, oily, and reactive skin for reference, and LOVE this sunscreen! I garden a lot in the spring/summer, and its so nice to be able to reapply sunscreen without using your hands directly. Have used this for months with no breakouts. I have noticed that this gets into my eyes ONLY at the very very very end of the day (like 10+ hours), likely due to my oily eyelids haha — throughout the day, there is no stinging! The only con I could note is the high price; I wish sunscreens like this were more accessible for everyone as it helps protect from skin cancer. * This product gave me red bumpy skin. The first time I used it I thought something else caused it becuase I also tried new makeup that day. I tried again with no makeup and had the same thing happen. Horrible. I had prefectly clear skin and its been 5 days and my face hasnt gone back to normal. I do have sensitive skin, but thats why I bought a pricier product… * Its pricey but for me very worth it. I work in outdoors and I use this sunscreen every single day. I have very sensitive skin, and it has not given me acne or allergies and its not dried out my skin. I highly recommend for all of us that are constantly in the sun. Also highly sweat and water resistant."

And it is now a constant staple i have. The smell is also nice not too fragramt  and not the typical sunscreen amell * I used this on just myself maybe 4 times and it was gone. For how expensive this is you do NOT get enough product. * Used this on my trip that had almost zero shade and in the pool. Kept me protected in the water and outside the water. No weird smell, It does leave a slight tint on the skin, just looks like a tan. Would 100% buy again * I really like this formula. It covers well and it's fragrant but not too heavy or greasy. It did pretty well in the water too. * I don't get much sun exposure because I like to stay indoors mostly, BUT I use this still to keep my skin young! Doesn't at all leave a greasy or sticky residue and rubs in really easily! I will say careful when spraying if you have tile or wood floors cause it'll be slippery at first but it honestly dries up pretty quickly * This stuff is way too expensive, for toxin-filled sunscreen. As a sunscreen, it doesn't really work well, anyway. You definitely can't just spray it on and go. You have to be sure to soak yourself with the spray and then slather it on VERY WELL.  Otherwise, you'll be lookin like a zebra. It's ridiculous. Never seen a sunscreen so finicky before. The smell is horribly chemically and not good for the lungs to breathe, so hold your breath, while spraying!  Also, it is gone after about 2 uses!!!!! Crazy! That is for using it on a 10 y/o body, at that! Wouldn't last an adult's body but maybe one use! Will never purchase again! * I don't know how people can say this isn't greasy. Maybe ""shiny"" & greasy are different things to people, but this appears very oily on the skin, almost as if it doesn't evaporate all the way. My main problem with this sunscreen, however, is that it stained my green shirts, and it did not come out in the wash! I could even see oily yellow residue on the nozzle after I closed it, so I know it's greasy and has a color to it. Yea the sunscreen works (but I think most do), and I think the smell is actually nice, but I can't recommend it if it's going to ruin your clothes. I would take white residue on skin over yellow grease stains on clothes any day."
101,101,101,101,cerave,hydrating sheer sunscreen face and body lotion with spf 30,pimprod2036753,2606576," * Tried this on recommendation. Ugh. Leaves a white cast and is basically pointless in blocking the sun. Burned the first time using it. I had been using La Roche Posay and it had prevented burns, but this did nothing to prevent the sun. All the work I've done on my skin over the winter is now for naught. * This is my all time favorite sunscreen it is my go to last step of my morning skincare rountine. I worked with all my makeup products with making my skin feel heavy. Very hydrating i use it on my face neck and tattoos. I have very sensitive combo skin w rosacea and this product works great for me! * I was introduced to this specific sunscreen because I received some small samples. They convinced me to buy the full sized bottle! Its lightweight and melts into the skin quickly. Even my husband noticed how it didnt leave a white cast on him and appreciated how moisturizing the sunscreen is. We even apply it to our faces without issue. I think this will be our go-to sunscreen from now on! * I wanted to love this sunscreen because it didn't feel greasy or sticky after applying. However, I quickly learned that when you start to sweat, it doesn't stay. Ended up getting in my car with black leather seats after a few hours at a baseball game and didn't think anything of it until I got home and realized I had two white casts from where my legs had rested. It transferred to the leather and took a while to remove the stain. * I didn't initially buy this to use as my daily facial sunscreen, but I ran out of my usual moisterizer with SPF and have been using this instead. I really like the texture to apply under make up and it has not caused any acne or clogged pores, which I am usually prone to! I am going to repurchase for daily use going into summer, and I am curious to see how it holds up with more humid weather and sweat. * I'm really conflicted on how I feel about this product. I do adore the initial thin, liquidy texture of this product. And I love how moisturizing, yet lightweight the product feels upon application and setting. But it has a few problems. I'm pretty fair, and this sunscreen still leaves a VERY noticeable white/pink cast on my skin. It doesn't set into beard hair well at all either. It will color dark hairs white. And when I sweat, even a little bit, it starts running EVERYWHERE. It legitimately looks like I'm melting when wearing this. 😩 Great texture, application, and finish on the product overall. But it runs with slight sweating and the white cast is very obvious. * This sunscreen is very runny and liquidy. I find it doesn't blend that good into the face. It's very hydrating. I think I would prefer to use it on my body."
102,102,102,102,dime,tinted glow wonderscreen spf 30,pimprod2043028,2621467," * I really love this sunscreen. Its a very sheer tint but perfect alone or under make up. It doesnt have a scent and dries down almost matte. Not oily at all. I got shade 2 and it lools very dark for me but blended in great! It also doesnt burn my eyes! A little pricey but worth it. I have senstive acne prone skin and have had no issues! I will probably buy shade one in the winter when im super pale but shade two is perfect with a tan * I love dime perfume so I thought I'd try their skin care. 
This looks terrible on dry skin. It cakes and flakes.
I have very light skin, but the lightest tint is basically white and looks so bad. 

Please save your money. * I really wanted to love this product. It was too dark for me and I got the medium shade and I have olive skin although it did make my skin feeling soft it was way too oily for me from the initial put on. * I have used this tinted sunscreen for 1.5-2 years and havent used anything else . I constantly re-buy this in shade 2 . If you used the original before shades 1-3 , shade 2 is the original ! I use it as my base before make up and use it on its own daily for work . Layers well and keeps my skin supple and glowy . I have never re-purchased a product like i have this one before . Highly recommend ! My skin type is dry/normal * I absolutely love this sunscreen. It goes on smoothly and improves skin texture. Great sun protection. LOVE that the ingredients are so clean! * Theres better * I am in love with this stuff! Chemical sunscreens have always irritated my skin and mineral sunscreens are always so sticky and leave a horrible residue, but this stuff is so good I almost can't believe it. No smell, no irritation whatsoever, great coverage and makes my skin feel moisturized and healthy. I'll never try another one after this."

Works so well. Very hydrating, goes on clear and actually works * I had been using this for almost a year. All of a sudden, I started getting itchy specifically on my neck everytime I'd use this. Then once it got so bad when I was on a plane mid-flight and my skin started to swell on my neck and face. I could barely open my eyes. It was frightening! I have no idea what in this did it, but beware. * I was using this spf for a while but I started noticing that my skin started to look red and my neck was all itchy. Then I went back to check reviews and I see I'm not the only. I will not buy this again. * This is a staple for me! I love that it feels lightweight, it blends in easily and it doesn't leave my skin smelling like sunscreen all day! This is my current favorite sunscreen rn and I truly like it more than a lot of high end sunscreens! I love to recommend this to friends and family bc I feel like it's a hidden gem that doesn't deserve enough love! * I was suprised to read the comments on this and see all of the negative ines. For me this is the perfect sunscreen. The perfect texture, easy to apply and no white cast. Leaves your skin glowy but not greasy at all, extremely lightweight but still moisturizing. I dont wear any makeup on top of it though so I cant speak to that, but I am a pale redhead and it has worked great for me all summer! * I don't usually put reviews but everyone's hating on this sunscreen. i don't use it under makeup but I've been using it every day and it feels nice and hydrating. i have acne prone sensitive skin but it hasn't irritated me. i have an olive complexion and if i rub it in enough it doesn't leave a white cast. i think it's pretty good for the price. i guess everyones skin has a different reaction to different ingredients so you just have to find what works for you"
104,104,104,104,supergoop!,glow oil spf 50 dry body oil sunscreen,pimprod2042888,2617634," * The first few words on the back of this bottle are ""clean chemical sunscreen actives"" but this isnt a clean product if that's what you're looking for.

7 of the main ingredients come up as hazardous or harmful when it's scanned into the Yuka app. Octocrylene is an endocrine disruptor and once broken down it becomes carcinogenic, studies have found. Just an FYI this isnt exactly ""clean"".

It's also a bit greasy, you'll need to wash your hands after using it before toughing your hair or face. * Because the oil lays on thick, I think it takes a long time for it to settle in the skin, so it's easy to come off. I kept reapplying, but whenever I would switch sides tanning, I felt my skin burning. The oil probably rubbed off on my towel, and I ended up burnt. I should have gone with a spray since I think it absorbs in the skin faster since it's a lighter coat so to speak.

It seems to be that you can't sit or lay down for 20 minutes while it's being absorbed since it's really easy for it to come off. * I applied and reapplied and reapplied and i am so burnt after being at the beach for jusr a few hours that you would think I never applied any sunblock at all. My skin hurts and is radiating heat. My friend and i both feel like the oil was amplifying the sun rather than blocking it. She isnt red because she has more naturally occurring melanin than i do, but her skin is painful and tight as well. I wanted to love it like i do the rest of their products I've tried, but instead I'll be going back to normal sunblock. * I was so happy I found an oil with spf as I usually use coco oil but wanted something with better protection for vacation. I wore this for hours bathing in the sun and didnt burn one bit. HOWEVER, my skin erupted in tiny little bumps all over. My body skin is not sensitive and I was extremely surprised and disappointed since Supergoop is so well trusted. It took days to have the bumps go away and in certain areas i can still feel them and its been over a week. Would not recommend as it is highly irritating. * as a person who uses body oil over body lotion daily, and who has consistent problems with product pilling, I love this.  It sits on top of my other skincare without interacting.  it's a little pricey but worth it, since I cannot seem to find a similar product made by a drugstore brand.  if there was, I would buy it.

I don't use it on my face because facial oil makes my glasses fall off, but I don't see why you couldn't * Felt very greasy on skin.  And broke out. I will buy this again.  Will look into a different brand.  It isnt worth the price either. * This glow oil is insaneeely good! It glides onto the skin and looks so natural just that glow from within. I love that it doesn't need feel sticky either. Obsessed! Grateful to be gifted by supergoop."
105,105,105,105,vacation,spf 30 baby oil,pimprod2038616,2596248," * Tried it and it doesnt work, maybe for a short period of time but i wore it on a float trip and it didnt do any protecting, i reapplied multiple times but if its not water resistant being an oil whats the point in it. I guess use it if you just wanna lay out maybe but i wouldnt but again * I got this as a gift with purchse of their Classic Whip sunscreen. Wow, the smell of this is so nice! It definitely has a baby smell, so if you're not looking for that typical coconut, pineapple, etc this may be for you. It reminds me of the classic Love's Baby Soft fragrance from the 80's. This entire brand seems to capture these throwback products really well! Kudos for that! I wish there was a larger size option, but I'll definitely purchase a full size bottle. * Be sure to look at the fluid ounces before buying.  This is about the size of a cell phone.  I was expecting at least a standard size bottle. I feel stupid.  Smells good but not a good value. I've not used in sun yet.  Gotta save for a special occasion since it will last a whole 3 minutes. * I was hoping this would smell like the Vacation perfume but it smells like 1975 baby powder.  So strongly!! Amd the bottle is horribly leaky.  I picked up curbside from the store and by the time i was home the inside of the bag was so greasy. * obsessed with the packaging and smell of this one! and im so glad it includes good spf unlike actual baby oil. only taking 1 star off because the bottle leaks like crazy so if you travel you can lose quite a bit of it… * found this product on sale. tried it out, felt amazing, smells great, so silky and smooth. I went back ordered 2 more and their face spray, which I recommended as well! * Absolutely not safe for time in the sun. I got burned right throufh it. Might be ok for daily wear, like a work commute."
106,106,106,106,neutrogena,ultra sheer face serum spf 60+,pimprod2030654,2592306," * I so wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this! I did not but it to use under makeup but there's no way I could. Using 2 fingers; the amount recommended by dermatologists, my face was GREASY!! Also burned my eyes, as many others have stated. 
I' plan to return it. I can't see! It coats your eyes! * I frequently use neutrogena products and almost exclusivly use thier sun protection products. However, when i tried this i had an AWFUL reaction. It had such an intense reaction with my eyes, they were hurting and red for over a week after using this product once. When a friend had the same reaction, i looked into it, and this product is known to cause this reaction. Do not purchace. 

I will continue to buy and use the other Neuterogena Sunscreens - just never this one. * The only Spf I continue to buy. However it does burn your eyes if it gets into them. I try my best not to touch my face after applying to avoid it. * For the first couple weeks of using this product i enjoyed it thoroughly, other than the fact that it irritates eyes. I got around it by avoiding the eye contour area during application. As of late my skin has been reacting poorly to this product, my skin feels dry within a couple hours of application and I have developed a mild rash around my nose and lips (the most sensitive areas on my face). I really wanted to love it, but I will have to get rid of it. * Love the texture and it applies easy but somehow this always migrates to my eyes and burns. * Love this sunscreen! It's lightweight, non-greasy, and a perfect primer for makeup. I used it on my Florida trip recently and it protected me from sunburns. Recommend! * I use many Neutrogena products with no issues, but I have used this one 3x in different months already, and every time I did so I got acne forming on my forehead. I've read others' recent reviews as well, and wish I had seen it earlier, because it also got into my eyes throughout the day and it hurt bad."
107,107,107,107,hero cosmetics,force shield superlight sunscreen broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2030344,2591983," * I've been using this for 4+ years starting in July 2021. I have not used another sunscreen since. I am a brown skinned girl, and this has worked WONDERS for my skin. I have not had a bad breakout since I started using this. I use this EVERYDAY. one pump is all you need, after I use any water based or oil free based moisturiser. Reccommend it to everyone I know!!! * I really like this sunscreen so far, no white cast, and dries more matte than most of my other mineral sunscreens (but I also didn't find it too drying, and I have pretty dry skin). My main criticism is the packaging. Because it has a pump dispenser, I want to hold it upright, but I don't think there's a straw in it, so to get anything to come out I actually have to hold it pointed down. And there's just far too much plastic in general for a pretty dumb design. All it needs is a screw cap and a hole you squeeze out of. Fix that and it'd be great. * I got a sample size for a trip to the Keys and was on a boat for a few hours and it worked wonders! I did not burn at all on my face ans ended up with a beautiful tan! I also was snorkeling as well and still no burn! Haven't tried it with makeup yet, but as a sunscreen for a day on the water it was great! Just always remember to reapply if you will be out for a while! * Lightweight, breathable, slightly green tinted (but doesn't show on skin) sunscreen. Works well as I use this on my face every day multiple times a day * I was on the market for a moisturizer that offered redness correction and was excited when this product came up in my search.

Unfortunately, this product just was not working for me. If applied to freshly clean skin, it worked fine, but if I had toner on, the moisturizer would start pilling. 

After a few hours of wear, my skin texture looked terrible and left my skin looking dried out. * So i've been officially using this sun screen for a week and i really do love it for my acne prone skin. It also has a really nice scent to it like pistachios lol. Absorbs fast and doesn't feel greasy! i do have a lot of texture on my chin and a lot of acne scars/ so i experienced some pilling there but thats super minor and the only con about this sunscreen for me. Otherwise i had no new breakouts caused, and i will be repurchasing! * I did a lot of research before buying this on sale. The last facial sunscreen I tried burned my face. I still don't know what did it, as the individual ingrediants were all in other products I use. Anyways, I tried this. I'm not outside much, but wanted to anticipate the summer heat/humidity. I needed something ok for combo skin with acne (humidity makes my acne worse), yet also ok for skin that had damage/rosacea. This has been wonderful! I patch tested first. It's really helped keep my skin from being too oily and shiny. No white cast (light skintone), no reactions. I'm Autistic and super sensitive to smell, and I don't smell anything from it when applying. I store my container upside down— plastic top down in the box, and I have had no issues with the pump. It's quit tidy and easy. The only drawbacks that I've observed from it, is that it can be drying on the dryer parts of my skin. What I do is spray some kind of moisterizer spritz on my face like Rosewater toner, moisterizing toner, etc. Do this just after applying the sunscreen, and as needed throughout the day if you feel dry. I'm sure you could also put moisterizer over it, as it dries down well. It also could pill if you put it over skincare without letting the skincare absorb first. Give it 10-15 minutes between moisterizer and sunscreen. No pilling when I switched to doing that. So the drawbacks are easy enough to overcome. I do think it has helped with my acne too. Cannot attest for how it looks under face makeup, as I do not wear foundation."

You will love ! I am acne prone and prefer mineral and i love this one great mineral protection and it does not pill under makeup. On my 3rd bottle ! * I wanted something lightweight to wear everyday underneath my makeup but this sunscreen is thick and doesn't settle into the skin as nicely as i was hoping for. I used this product before a workout and it burned my skin as i started to sweat. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with dry and/or sensitive skin. Bummed because i was super excited to try this brand! * This is the best thing that Bubble has made probably so far!!🫶🏻 I use it every single day!! * I am caucasian, ok? Like, Scandanavian. I am from The Netherlands. I got this because of the reviews and I was hoping it would give a little tint so that I don't have to wear makeup all the time. Some reviews said that the company should offer color selection, but it's unnecessary. I'm glad I looked at the pictures, which show someone rubbing it in, and it seems to be dissolving into their skin and skintone. That's exactly what it does. Do not be alarmed when you put this on your hands and you think it's too orange. It's not. After you gently rub it in all over your face and neck, it kind of smoothes out and works with your natural skin tone. It really evens my face and rest of my body out, without looking like I have anything on. 

I was almost afraid and threw it out, but I'm glad I gave it two more tries. Several people have told me my skin is glowing and I look good since I got this stuff. It does take a second to fall into the skin, but my makeup looks excellent and glowing on top! * I have ohrchaser 4-5 dofferenr ""highly-rated"" face sunscreens for my face but they have all disappointed me. This one feels perfect! Not too heavy or sticky and doesn't clog my pores or causes breakouts. The light tint is not noticeable and my skin looks so even toned. * This blended easily with no cast. I let it sit on bare skin for 15 min, went outside and my face felt hotter than any where else. Not a good start. I then applied my skin like, self setting foundation and 20 min later it's still tacky and looks to be sitting semi heavily on top. My normal products that set beautifully all lifted anything underneath when used with this. Used by itself it was a satin finish but 0 coverage that did not fully dry down. I used about a pump and a half for my face and neck. I have dry/normal skin.  I will try it with other base items but will most likely return."
109,109,109,109,kopari beauty,sun shield on-the-glow sheer stick sunscreen spf 40,pimprod2043794,2618936," * Great spf for travel or beach/pool days. Leaves skin dewy and sparkly and absorbs pretty well and has a nice scent… So, listen to the reviews! It does has large chunks of glitter flakes. It will be noticeable on the skin. However, I've been using this for the past few days on my face and I like it. Be careful applying to close to the eye area because it can burn… Has a nice light tropical scent. * This stuff is so pretty on the skin and effective! This is part of my daily routine. I put it on mu chest / arms and its very comfortable and long lasting. I wore it out in the pool for 2+ hours (im very very fair skinned) and i did not burn. This product gives me the perfect glow. Due to the heavy oils and glitter, i would not put this on my face, but it's beautiful elsewhere. * not greasy, not too glowy, feels lightweight, overall great product! but that glitter is pretty big AND it sticks a lot - even after a shower it was still there, so just be aware if that bothers you! * I use this as a cute little add on after my thicker SPF creams. The glitter adds a cute glow and its perfect for reapplying throughout the day. * I saw this originally on Kopari's page and was SO excited to try it! It truly is the perfect on-go must have! I love that it keeps my skin protected with the right amount of subtle glow. I am taking this everywhere with me! * I'm a huge fan of Kopari's sun products and this stick lived up to all expectations! After the first application, the glow is much more even and leaves such a beautiful, natural highlight. The stick format makes it super easy to apply and I can't wait to use this stick throughout the warmer months! * I got this as soon as it came out, I'm really excited to wear it this summer! The first application, there were some big sparkles, but once I swiped it a few more times, it applied evenly. I like the highlight and sunscreen in one of this product."
110,110,110,110,coola,classic body organic sunscreen lotion spf 50 fragrance free,pimprod2030631,2591975," * I was hesitant to try this because of some of the negative reviews, especially the reviews that mention a bad smell; however, I'm happy to report that mine has ZERO smell. It has a fairly lightweight consistency and blends onto the skin seamlessly. There is a slight tacky feel, and I noticed that when I rested my elbows on surfaces in my car, a grease spot was left behind - this is the reason I took off 1 star. Yet overall, this is a nice product that I'd definitely recommend. I also appreciate the fact that it's free of coconut oil! * This is my go-to for my tattoos and I've been using it for about 3 or 4 years now. There is no white cast, and it makes my tattoos (all black and gray) pop! I can truly attest to the sun protection, as once I missed a spot and could see a very clear, visible pink patch with a hard line differentiating from where the protection was! I also use this on my daughter who has sensitive skin and eczema, and it seems to be going okay. 

Fragrance-free means no added frangrance—so it smells like a natural sunscreen, which I don't mind. But I see some people complaining about that…

If you're looking for excellent sun protection, especially for tattoos, I HIGHLY recommend this product! * Dries quickly and invisible on skin. Leaves a somewhat velvety texture, but feels very light and not sticky. Good amount of product for the price. I had high hopes due to positive reviews about no cast and fragrance-free (I'm very sensitive to scents). I have to wear/reapply sunscreen a lot for medical reasons, so I'm very picky and this one checks almost every box. 

However, it has a horrible chemical-y smell, sort of like plastic? I actually thought it was just from the container and would disappear after drying, but even hours later, I could still smell it on my skin. It's not super strong, but I wear sunscreen on legs, arms and face and reapply frequently, so it's noticeable.

I'll try to use it up because it's so pricey, but definitely will not be repurchasing. Really disappointing because it's wonderful otherwise! Probably good for a beach day, sports, etc. Just not for everyday. * I wanted an everyday spf for my body during the upcoming spring/summer months and I loved the idea of this sunscreen. I especially loved the ingredients and fragrance free aspect. Unfortunately, as other customers reviewed - it does indeed have a scent. I was not too crazy about the scent so I returned it. It's not a fruity or sweet smell, more of a chemical scent which was light but I could smell on my arm especially if my arm was near my face. 
PRO: it does rub in very nicely, no white cast (I'm tanned), not greasy. * Ill preface with this- I am a pale white lady, so I cannot trally speak to if it truly causes a cast. I have not noticed one personally.
I really like how smoothly and quickly this rubs in. And it doesn't smell. Its my daily go to for my body before heading out for the day. The only downfall ive found is that it's pricey. * I am really particular with sunscreen, only using mineral sunscreen. I sort of resigned myself to never finding a mineral one that would be transparent once applied. The nI found this. It's so smooth and leaves zero white residue! * Fine when dry, used at Las Vegas and no sunburns this May. Used again at a waterpark this weekend in June and ended up with sunburns along with the person who helped me finish the bottle so I can go back to my preferred active sunscreen this summer. You could feel the slimy lotion just slipping away as soon as you got into water. And we waited the 15 minutes before we entered the water too. I would never use this around water again and recommend you only use with no water contact intended. We reapplied as recommended so I don't believe this is user error."

No greasy feeling. * I suffered all day with irritated burning eyes after using this product. * This suncreen spray is very oily. The directions state that you can apply over makeup but I would not recommend that, it will have you looking like a glazed donut & your makeup just might slide off. The coola makeup setting spray is a better option if you are looking for something that does not make your face oily. It does feels a little drying but its better then the mist. * I did not expect it to have such a strong alcohol like scent to it. It makes sense as it is quick drying, but the smell was off-putting to me. * So this product did prevent me from getting sunburned while I had on a full face of makeup. HOWEVER this spray left me a shiny, greasy mess which accentuated all of my texture. It did not disrupt my makeup, but it did make my makeup look worse. * It doesnt feel greasy but it looks greasy. Probably better for dry skin. Im more oily. Makes me look terribly shiny i dont like that. Easy to use and i do like how it feels * I have only had the product for three days in my bathroom, and half the bottle leaked out."

Makes it really easy to reapply af school. * This face stick is so much easier to apply on the kids than a lotion or spray. It smells really good and a little goes along way.

She has sensitive skin when it comes to fragrances and had no reaction to this thankfully. Application is so easy she can do it herself. * It's better than the super goop glow stick, in price, application, and less oily! * Got this for my girls. It's super easy to apply and smells good.

My old sunscreen left a really bad white cast and was way to heavy for my face leaving me feeling dry and greasy some how but after one use of this product it spreads easily, nice and light, no whitecast! * so i got this as a free sample and decided to try it out while the UV was particularly high. as a sunscreen it worked spectacularly and I didnt have any problems with it until i had to take my makeup off. when i was taking it off my face started to sting and get patchy red. it got kinda bad. maybe im allergic to something in this or maybe it was just my skin. overall i dont think i would get this product again. have a blessed day! 💕😃☀️ * so i got this as a free sample and decided to try it out while the UV was particularly high. as a sunscreen it worked spectacularly and I didnt have any problems with it until i had to take my makeup off. when i was taking it off my face started to sting and get patchy red. it got kinda bad. maybe im allergic to something in this or maybe it was just my skin. overall i dont think i would get this product again. have a blessed day! 💕😃☀️ * So on first application, the spf 40 is more matte, and this one more dewy. But I noticed throughout the day, hours later, this one makes my face look much more matte and less oily than the spf 40. Which is good and what I'm looking for. The packaging is unfortunate, though. * I have repurchased several bottles of this and cant find an spf to replace her! I have very dry sesitive skin and i have experienced ZERO reactions with this. It hydrates my skin and provides the most beautiful glow. I have a very emollient skin care ritual and this lays beautifully with out peeling.

When I bought it I was not sure about the how it would feel on my skin. Well my skin took to it l Iike a duck to water. My skin looks and feels better than ever, even after all the sun damage I did to it over the years (I am a 60's baby who was a teenager in the 70's when we did not know what SPF was and chose sunscreen by smell, I did not do the Crisco or baby oil and iodine crazingness). It is amazing how moisturized my skin looks when I put it on, which is daily. The skin on my legs and arms look like they did 30 years ago plus I have the bonus of SPF50! The dry old lady skin on my legs and arms is gone! I would recommend this product to everyone I know no matter what there age is! * Ordered this because I use body wash with AHA and havent been protecting my skin. Got the smaller size to try it out. So far, I like it but it has a noticeable scent. Almost like honey. It may say this in tje ingredients but I was thrown off because there other products are scentless or has a sunscreen smell.

It fades with time but wouldnt be weird if you were layering scents and the honey stayed around"

Great texture but I reacted badly to something in it. Guessing it was the algae because I've used the other ingredients before without issue. * DO NOT BUY new formula is horrible. Not the same product whatsoever. Why ruin a great product everyone loved?? Makes no sense. Ive gone through at least 10 of these moisturizers and now i will no longer purchase. And the new scent is a crime against humanity. * This used to be SOOOO awesome.  Now my face oily by 10 am and feels very irritated.  Also broke me out for the first time in a while.  Had zero issues with the old formula.  I really hope they change it back * What a great and rich sunscreen! The texture of this is super rich and hydrating while feeling so comfortable on my skin. I love that it doesn't leave a white film over my skin, it just soaks right in. Gifted by Supergoop * This was my holy grail of moisturizers with sunscreen for years. It kept my skin hydrated without making it greasy, had no scent, played well with any eye cream I paired it with and never broke me out. Since the formula change, this has given me nothing but problems.
First is the scent. IT REEKS. It smells like a burning pit and the smell does NOT dissipate. I am super sensitive to scents and the old formula had a slight smell to it but you didn't notice it after you put it on.
Next, the consistency is now a bit chalky and not as creamy as it used to be.
Lastly, the hydration is gone. My skin is dry about 45 minutes after I put this on. Now, that could be mostly due to my skin hating the new formula, so take this as you will.
I hate that I have to stop using this. It was a decent price and worked well for me which can be hard to come by, but I'll sadly have to give it up. * Leave my skin oily and shiny , but i still use it because it was blending good with my make up and wasn't leaving a white cast on my skin until i checked the actives ingredients are not recommended for breastfeeding (actually not good for anyone) and it has a sunscreen smell so  im switching to a mineral susncreen. * This looks like I'll  be fhe first non-incentivized review. I love the unseen sunscreen and was so excited to try a rich cream with spf as i have very dry skin. The texture of the product when i tested on my hand was so nice and absorbed great. However, when I applied it to mt face for the first time i noticed a HORRIBLE smell. It smells like a chemical plant and it lasts the entire time its on my skin. I'm not usually too picky about how fragrance free products smell but this is so bad I have to return."

Where as a different brand of 30 spf protected me with zero sunburn in other areas! Sad because this was so expensive :( * This is not sunblock. This js a greasy body oil that does not absorb into the skin * This is a very oily product that feels greasy after applying. It doesn't shimmer at all like it says to be. I used this on my 3 day beach trip and ended up super sunburnt! Seems like the spf didn't work at all and I'm really sad because this is so expensive. The only good thing about it is the smell. Other than that, it's overpriced and leaves you with no sun protection. * This makes my skin glow due to its somewhat oily sheen. If you apply too much, it can feel very greasy , so don't do that. The glitter is almost non existent for anyone wondering about that. If you don't like oils on skin, this isn't for you. The smell is fantastic, like a tropical getaway! My only gripe is the dispenser. Its too close to the bottle and can be a slippery pain once its on the hands. Still love it though. * I brought this for a cruise and was sadly disappointed. I did not mind the greasy/oily feeling. The lack of sun protection had my skin on f*re and I ended up with sunburn after reapplying. The shimmer did not last more than 5 minutes on my skintone. * I bought this because I figured it would smell good and sparkle unlike other sunscreen which it did, However it is very oily and was unpleasant. I did use it in Oklahoma for the first time and it was very hot that day so I figured that may have influenced the oiliness but who knows. It did protect my tattoos from the sun so I'd say it did its job. * I bought the travel size of this and went through this product ridiculously fast, within 4 uses as its a thin product and you need to apply it twice. I also thought the ""glow"" was more just a slight shine that could be achieved with any sunscreen. I'll stick with my traditional sunscreen because I feel like its just not worth the price for how quickly it disappears"

The white cast is excessive and remains visible no matter how much you rub it in. It's a waste of money. * I really tried to make this work. I have never been disappointed by a Cerave product before until this. I know most of the reviews are complaining about the white cast but i was able to mix in bronzing drops with mine and then apply makeup over it to solve that problem. What i couldnt get past was the SMELL! It smells so incredibly bad and the smell lingers. For a very long time. And God forbit u get some on your mouth and taste it! To me it smells like burning rubber. And hours later i will still get wiffs of the smell. Its really bad. I honestly thought I purchased a defective bottle because of how rancid the smell is, and is the only reason i came and looked at the reviews. It is an SPF 50 and mineral sunscreen so at least it has that going for it. Other than that, this product is a major flop from a company that imo has always put out good reliable affordable products. Very disappointing. Dont waste your money. * It is mineral sunscreen.  Fantastic one at that.  The point of it is skin protection.  Cute and blistered doesn't sound appealing to me.  A little product goes a long way.  Wipe your face before reapplying. * This says it's for the face but it's literally body sunscreen in a smaller container. It does not rub in at all. It looks like you're wearing white face paint * this is the worst sunscreen. I accidentally bought this thinking it was the tinted one. no matter how much you rub it into your skin it wont go away 😟😟😟 * Although this product leaves a white cast, I have found that using a dime size amount and applying it in sections, helps lessen this appearance. Otherwise I think this product is effective. * Although it leaves a white cast on the face, I have found using a dime size of the product and applying it in the sections, decreases the white cast appearance.

It's very lightweight on the skin and shows no color at all.  I wear it under my makeup and put it on the top of my hands. * I really wanted to like this because it is by Shiseido and they usually do an excellent job. While this is an effective sunscreen that protects my skin, it has whitecast and sometimes gets in my eyes and makes them sting. I consider it an average option. * I like this sunscreen for the way it makes my skin feel. It doesn't freak me out, and I feel moisturized when I put it on. That being said, it does have a white cast, even on my very fair skin. Additionally, I noticed that if I put makeup over top, it's a disaster. My foundation will separate within an hour and has a terrible texture. So I only use this product when I'm not wearing make up on its own. I think this would be a great sunscreen for a beach day. * I was so disappointed with the formula and how it leaves a white cast. * Hylauronic acid is supposed to help as an added moisturizer but it ruined this product. At the very least shiseido could bring back the old formula as well? This stuff is hard on skin. Old formula was a dream, so sad it's gone :( * i am a fan of the old formulation, and am disappointed with this ""upgrade"" by shiseido mainly because unless you continue to reapply throughout the day or finish with powdered makeup it gives a sheen to the skin that becomes shinier over time (and in the humid southeast this is quite an annoyance). this sheen is likely due to the addition of hyaluronic acid and removal of cornstarch from the formulation which means the product grabs onto whatever moisture it can get and no longer has a product to battle excess sebum production. still, it is a good sunscreen and i will use it until it's gone, i just have to reapply or blot my nose at lunch. if you are desparate for a mattifying sunscreen, this is no longer a top choice. also, a lot of consumers really should learn what ""oil-free"" actually means in makeup land: it does not mean it won't make your skin oily, it means the product is formulated without oil and is usually silicone based (dimethicone, amodimethicone, etc). i think a lot of you would be far more satisfied if you knew what you were talking about and had realistic expectations. * My skin is usually pretty durable when it comes to most products. Except for sunscreen. I have been on the hunt for a good face sunscreen for a long time and I had high hopes when I bought. 

Well I'm currently going through a nightmare allergic reaction that won't go away and I'm on the 5th day after using it only once. Please save your skin and do NOT use this."

It looks like a serum or moisturizer on the skin. No cast at all. * Its so cute and great to throw in your bag. I have dry skin so i welcome how moisturize it makes you. Once it breaks its the worst product I've ever had and it will continue to break and crumble. This sunstick is almost 30 dollars and you end up wasting over half the product * I don't use this on my face because I'm already hopelessly greasy, but it's great to use on my 12 year old son. It doesn't irritate his face, and no complaints about his eyes stinging. Unlike most sunscreens, it's not messy to apply to a squirming kid. It isn't as quick as a spray sunscreen, but I feel that this stick is more effective than the sprays I've tried. The packaging is compact so you can carry it in your purse * Took this on a travel trip to Mexico for 4 days. It worked great, works well with makeup & works wonderful with dry skin folks.

I don't know if I got a bad batch because the first time I applied some liquid came out with it. Even with shaking before applying, the sunscreen was still very shiny. It felt VERY wet on my face but this feeling did go away after a few minutes of wearing it. I have noticed that I've broken out a little more and that some of the acne has lasted longer than they normally do after I added this to my routine. Also, the sunscreen has a very orange tone to it. I'm cool toned and I don't know if I'm just seeing things but I noticed a slight difference in skin tone between the second and third picture after rubbing it in. I didn't notice sensitivity to my eyes when I was using this, so that's good! I'll probably be finishing this up as a body sunscreen. I'd say that if you have drier skin, aren't acne-prone, and have a warmer undertone this would probably work better for you than me! * After about 20 mins this sunscreen burns my eyes, even after wiping it off it burns…. would not reccomend * Pros: peach colored = no white cast on skin, goes on smoothly, very spreadable, seems to last, doesn't clog pores

Cons: cannot apply to eye area because product spreads throughout the day and gets into eyes and burns * I dont mind scents really and actually enjoy when something smells good. But this was strong. Its a very strong floral scent. Like it doesnt go away and you smell it when you move. If you get too close to your eyes it can burn. It did blend in nicely and was very moisturizing. But it doesnt seem to dry down at all. Too moisturizing for me as i was very shiny. Bordoeline greasy.  It did look good under makeup. I would suggest for very dry skin if you dont mind heavy scents. But theres better options imo. * After about 10 minutes outdoors, my eyes started stinging/burning very badly. I had to use my shirt to try and wipe away all of the product away from around my eye area, and i didnt put it around my eyes at all. I had to really scrub at the skin around my eyes to get enough off that i could go on with my day. * This orange stuff literally STAINED my shirt when it flicked out while closing the cap. When used on my body it's smooth, but after a while it becomes chalky and starts piling. When used on my face, it feels and looks super greasy. The radiance doesn't go away even after putting on a lot of setting powder. Also did I mention that this sunscreen has a very strong smell? No wonder my eyes were burning. * I usually use high end sunsceens like Neova, Revision, etc but I ran out and it take a while to order those( since no walk in stores have them). So I had been out a while and like 20 years ago tried this. My goodness have prices gone up! You might as well buy the high end stuff! Any ways I've used it twice and ( I do use retinold and AHA at night but this just pills right off and then my skin feels dry! I don't feel protected wearing it and it's burning my eyes today so pay 10 -15 more and get a high end one!"
134,134,134,134,coola,travel size piÃ±a colada classic body organic sunscreen spray spf 30,pimprod2012271,2561104," * I am loving COOLA right now. This SPF is perfect for this dreadful Texas humidity and heat. It's very lightweight, non-greasy, and has a pleasant scent. Reapplying is a breeze since the product doesn't build up on the skin or cause a film. It's very breathable and works well with general skin sensitivities. The size is quite large for travel, but still small enough to throw in your beach bag and still have space for other necessities. It has a click-locking spray top so it doesn't accidentally spray in your bag. I will say that if your skin is very dry, you may want to go for a cream SPF because this does not provide much moisture. This is definitely made for hot, sunny summers. I love it and I know for sure I am buying a full-sized bottle to keep on hand.

***This review was collected as part of a promotion.*** * As a professional in the beauty industry, I've learned firsthand the  importance of sun protection, making COOLA's  spray an indispensable asset. In an industry where skincare is very important, COOLA stands out with its dedication to not only protecting against harmful UV rays but also enhancing the overall experience of sun care.

COOLA's sunscreen spray doesn't just shield your skin from UVA and UVB rays; Its broad-spectrum protection ensures comprehensive coverage, safeguarding against both premature aging and potential skin damage. As someone deeply invested in skin health, I love COOLA's commitment to providing a product that protects and cares for my skin.

The scent of Piña Colada fragrance is delicious. Gone are the days of sunscreen smelling like, well, sunscreen. Instead, COOLA's tropical scent transports me to my last vacation. It's a big change from the clinical smell of traditional sunscreens, making the application process a sensory experience.

I did not have any issue in my delicate skin but I always recommend  a patch test.

In my personal opinion, COOLA's in spray isn't just a sun protection product; it's an  evolution of skincare.

 In conclusion, the COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a luxurious and effective sun protection solution for those who appreciate both quality and indulgence in their routine. * As a licensed Esthetician, we our taught early on how important using SPF to protect our skin. This aerosol is easy to use and smells amazing! If you have sensitive skin I would recommend spraying into your hands first then applying. I did have a slightly burning feel when I sprayed directly. But, overall I really love how cute and small and effective this spf is to use. My skin adapted the more I used this spf. * I love this sunscreen! Its perfect for travel and smells great. I used it almost all up on my recent vacation. It smells likea tropical holiday on a beach with a coconut. I would definetly recommend. I know the spf is quality and better packaged and easily portable. * This review was collected as part of a promotion. My name is Michele and I'm a Beauty Expert in my early 30's with fair combination skin. As the weather gets warmer, I have to make sunscreen a priority in my skincare routine. I am absolutely loving the Coola Clear Spray Body Sunscreen SPF 30 Piña Colada Sunscreen. I love its yummy, natural Piña Colada scent. It takes me away on a vacation to my favorite beach. This is a non-aerosol sunscreen that is so easy to spray onto your skin. It has a lightweight, lighter than air, mist texture that absorbs so quickly into my skin without leaving any greasy residue. I got the chance to try the full size 6 fluid ounce version of this spray sunscreen. This sunscreen is formulated with at least 70% Organic Ingredients. You get broad spectrum SPF 30 UVA and UVB protection. This sunscreen has water resistance that lasts up to 80 minutes so you can enjoy more time in the sun and water without worrying about reapplying every hour. With this amazing sunscreen you not only protect your skin but keep it hydrated too. Plant Protection is formulated with antioxidant rich nutrients which help fight free radicals, hydrates and nourishes your skin barrier too. Safflower Oleosomes is plant derived encapsulation technology that makes this formulation even more effective. Spray this sunscreen on your skin 15 minutes before any sun exposure. Make sure to reapply this sunscreen every 80 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone of any age who loves the sun and wants to have lightweight, long lasting and fast absorbing sun protection that also keeps your skin hydrated too. * Sun care is very important because it can help prevent skin cancer. I can't stress enough how important it is to wear sunscreen everyday. I was looking for a new everyday sunscreen and I think I found it. I prefer spray sunscreen than a cream so this one is perfect. It smells absolutely amazing and I love it! With most sunscreens they can get really heavy and greasy. I was really pleased that it absorbs really well on the skin and doesn't leave a layer of oil behind. Another thing I like is the ingredients, because I was having a hard time finding sunscreens that didn't have harsh or harmful ingredients. The Coola brand has organic and vegan ingredients so no worries about having harmful chemicals being absorbed in your body. So far so good and I would repurchase it."
135,135,135,135,black girl sunscreen,kids moisturizing broad spectrum spf 50,pimprod2038237,2609781," * I'm an adult but this sunscreen is my ultimate favorite. It doesn't break me out, has SPF 50, and lasts soooooo long!
I use this every single day. I took this on my 2 month European trip and wore this for my main protection. It didn't sweat off in the humidity and it didn't make me a greaseball on top of the sweat I was dripping. One bottle lasts me a minimum of 6months with exclusive, daily use on the face.
There is no cons. It's affordable, does what it claims, and is nice on the skin (bare or under makeup). I highly recommend this for everyone for any parts of the body. * Gets the job done and protects my extremely fair skin. Minimal smell and no white cast. However it can look quite oily so I just apply setting powder and setting spray over top and touch uo throughout the day. Has never caused my dry combo skin to break out. * Goes on smoothing and white cast free. Moisturizing. A little goes a long way. * This sunscreeb got me through a month in Italy with temperatures over 100+ degrees and stood up well throughout sweat. I'm very fair and didn't get sunburnt. Works well on fave and body, only con is it can look greasy. * This is amazing die our beautiful melantwd household. Ive also hifted these oroducts as gifts. * This is my go to sunscreen for body/hands/neck. Hydrating but not greasy, no fragrance, solid ingredients, great price. I do occasionally use it on my face as well and I like the finish but all chemical sunscreens migrate into my eyes and burn, so i don't fault this sunscreenfor that. * I cannot express how disappointed I am with this product. I wore this sunscreen for 12 hours and ended up with almost 9 blemishes on my previously clear skin. It's overwhelmingly greasy and oily. Only recommend for dryer skin types in dryer climates."
136,136,136,136,shiseido,urban environment vita-clear sunscreen spf 42,pimprod2039504,2612331," * I really like this sunscreen! It absorbs very quickly, lightweight, and help controls my oil production throughout the day. I still have to blot my face in the afternoon, but it helps. I also like to use a water base moisturizer underneath :) 
PLEASE NOTE* a little goes A LONG WAY! 
Your face will be a grease pit if you put too much on, learned the hard way. * I dont get why some people love the ""dewey"" effect because at least on me, when I put this sunscreen on, it felt like I just spent the day frying stuff in the kitchen and all sweaty, right after my shower! It went straight to the trash can. * This sunscreen reminded me of a drugstore formula, not something I'd expect from Shiseido. It has an oily, sticky texture - not like your typical Shiseido sunscreen or a clear sunscreen like Supergoop. It's greasy, doesn't absorb well, and it stings the eyes terribly like a poorly-formulated budget buy. I really dislike it and will be returning it."
137,137,137,137,tula,mineral magic oil- free mineral sunscreen fluid broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2025972,2584410," * I love this!  it's a mineral sunscreen for face that truly goes on clear.  It has a beige tint til applied.  It adds a natural glow and makes skin look beautiful.   Perfect for mature skin.The expiration date (on the box and tube) isn't always great - 5 months.  The tube leaks into the cap, so I store mine with the tip upward. 
it's spf30, so it's efficacy is 2 hours - so reapply.   I highly recommend this for a mineral sunscreen. * It's lightweight and easy to wear but I dont feel like it protects me enough from the sun. I feel like I need to apply so much for it to work. Plus it's very small for the price. * The first bottle i bought was perfect. The sunscreen is incredible and makes you look so glowy. Doesnt break me out. I didnt have an issue with the bottle leaking. I just bought a second bottle and it is just not travel friendly at all. Half of it spilled in my toiletry bag. Id love for the packaging to get fixed so its not leaky but the product itself is top notch. Only sunscreen id ever use on my face * I do like this. It has a slight tint that when applied it's hardly noticeable but sunscreen seems a little drying but not as much as some other tinted sunscreens that I""ve tried. Would buy this again. * I find this sunscreen perfect for sitting under makeup or wearing it alone. * This sunscreen has Butyloctyl Salicylate, a cousin to octisalate, and a chemical UV absorber. That's how they can get a higher SPF with such a low concentration of Zinc or TO. So it isn't purely mineral. I like it and use it, but I wish they wouldn't market it as 100% mineral when it has unregulated chemical UV absorbers in it. * I'm reviewing because I'm shocked to see the negative reviews. I have dry, sensitive, 40s skin with rosacea and occasionally cystic acne only during middle age (yay!). This tinted sunblock is the least *tinted* sunblock I've used. It leaves a very light, shiny, sheer, non-white cast. The shiny component disapeared within a few minutes of application, leaving a very slight glow. It was great for the wrinkles, not for the dark spots. I had to use concealer for any coverage. It's basically inert, but with sun protection. No white cast, no tint, no makeup but apparently good mineral sunblock. But it doesn't cause acne or rosacea for me! I fell asleep on it the first night; sleeping on past sunblocks makes me break out, regardless of the formulation. This one caused zero acne. Zero rosacea. Zero filling in lines; if anything it made my skin look more hydrated and glowing. I'm bummed about the lack of coverage but it's rather exemplary as a sunblock and anti-wrinkle primer. Maybe primer is the best definition. Probably keeping it because it's pretty good and not actively bad."
138,138,138,138,blue lizard australian sunscreen,sheer mineral sunscreen lotion for face spf 50+,pimprod2043669,2621977," * I was recommended by a dermalogist to use blue lizard. I have dark brown spots.I have been using this product for over 6 years. I have noticed a difference on my face. * I've heard nothing but good things about this brand and when I ran out of my current face sunscreen, I decided to try this one. I love that it's an SPF50. That's honestly the only positive thing I can say about this sunscreen. It comes out pretty runny, but it's the consistency of Elmer's Glue and I imagine that this is exactly what it would feel like if you tried to rub glue into your face. On top of being difficult to apply, it leaves a horrible white cast. This one was a miss for me. * Works incredibly well. Mild scent, but liquidy. Does take a little longer to rub in because of the consistency. However, it works! My son had a small pink spot after a full day of sun on his face. A little after suncare and the next day the pink spot was gone. Highly recommened * Blue Lizard is an excellent sunscreen.  I wanted to like this.  I need something I can wear under makeup.  This made my face look and feel very shiny/oily/sticky. * This product is very light and not heavy like normal sun screen. * Very liquidity, leaves a whitecast even on my porcelain skin tone, and has an okay blend. Would not buy again primarily because it made me break out. * i love this sunscreen. i've tried many mineral sunscreens since discovering i was allergic to chemical sunscreens, and this is the best one i've tried so far. it hasnt pilled once on my face, it never pills throughout the day like the others i've tried, and the ingredients are really great. it goes on so smoothly and never takes long to blend into my skin either. it isn't too thick at all. i use it 10 minutes after applying my vanicream sensitive skin moisturizer (which is glycerin-based) and it pairs SO SO well with that moisturizer. I find that most mineral sunscreens seem to do really well with a glycerin base moisturizer in my experience, but this one is the best. the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because it does go on with a slight white cast at first, but i find that the white cast disappears around 15 or so minutes after application. i'm not sure if i would recommend this sunscreen for darker skinned people because i am very fair skinned and it does initially have a white cast, even on me. besides that, this is the perfect sunscreen for me. I will definitely repurchase!"
139,139,139,139,sun bum,daily 50 face gel,pimprod2043277,2619923," * This is hands down the best-looking sunscreen I've ever tried.  Unlike other gel sunscreens, this one doesn't pill. * This contains coconut oil as one of the first ingredients.  If you are easily acne prone and/or prone to clogged pores stay away.  Coconut oil is HIGHLY comedogenic.  It would be nice if they created a facial sunscreen that is noncomedogenic. * I used sunscreen everyday. Feels good under makeup! It almost has a matte feeling - sorta like a primer. Definitely not the average face sun CREAM. Gel is in the name, gel is exactly the consistency! I would buy again! * It does not smell good. Especially vs all of their other products. Left a very oily/greasy sheen behind. Ended up taking it back."

It's great for my skin but my makeup doesn't stay on with it. I have to use a loose powder foundation so I can't reapply throughout the day. By midday my skin went from white to bright red.  This doesn't work for me. 

Additionally, post-COVID you're getting half the amount of product for the same price. I can't move past that and feel completely ripped off. * I really wanted to like this product and think it could be really cool if it wasn't for the smell. Not sure if it's the probiotics or my specific bottle, but it smells sour and has stayed smelly all day * I like the product itself - it feels like a really lightweight serum that I much prefer to use as opposed to a thicker spf as the last step in my skincare before makeup. However, I won't be repurchasing because the pump bottle consistantly sprays everywhere and ends up getting the product all over me (and not the back of my hand where I'm trying for!) Because it's such a thin, liquidy formula, a pour component would be much better and less messy because this really is a pain to use. * I do not like the application the pump makes it messy. If you have oily of combination skin do not get this product it gives you a dewy look and  with wear it makes your skin greases. I like the overall packaging. * I journeyed to Ulta recently seeking out a new primer, specifically one with SPF. A lovely store associate pointed me in the direction of Beekman 1802's ""Milk Primer"" and my life is changed. As someone with acne-prone combination skin, this primer doesn't cling to my dry spots or exacerbate any oiliness in my T-zone, all while providing SPF, which cuts down on the amount of products I need for skin prep. I wore this primer (under NARS' Light Reflecting Foundation) to a drag show in 80+ degree heat and my makeup didn't budge, even with all the sweat and dancing. I even tried applying foundation to one cheek with primer and one cheek without – the difference in texture was clear. Can't recommend this product enough! * I love applying this daily.  Only wish it came in a larger size so I wouldn't have to run to Ulta so often. * I'm trying to only use mineral sunscreen since I have Melasma after my last pregnancy. Finding a good mineral sunscreen is a challenge. I tried this after a recommendation in a Facebook group and I'm obsessed! It feels like an extension of my skincare. It's extremely lightweight vs other heavy and greasy sunscreens. I haven't needed to use my old makeup primers as well, my makeup sits great on top of this."

I understand it's sunscreen balm but I just couldn't  love it. It taste like was eating sunscreen. * I was looking for a lip product with SPF for the summer months and running outside. I love the flavor and texture of this product, and it is very moisturizing. I do with it was slightly thicker so it would stay on a bit longer. * extremely moisturizing, the acai one tastes mostly like sunscreen but the point of the product is sun protection not yummy taste. overall really enjoy this product!"
144,144,144,144,supergoop!,unseen sunscreen stick spf 40 invisible sun protection,pimprod2043900,2620575," * So i love how this feels in my skin. I can feel it, but it doesn't look greasy. Does make my make up more prone to smudging when im setting it which is annoying. Smudges when i apply over make up which is annoying, but perhaps wouldn't be so noticeable on lighter make up days. * This js a great sunscreen stick. Does not break me out (a miracle), glides over the skin without tugging, leaves make mostly intact (mostly), and feels comfortable on the skin. However - the stick is a round shape, and fairly wide. This makes it extremely difficult-to-impossible to get the stick anyway with angles or crevices. I cant get the stick to apply near my eyes and between my brows at the base of the nose. Other than that, I have nothing bad to say about this product. Highly recommend! * I burn very easily but love the sun. Every other face sunscreen I have tried eventually makes my combo skin too oily…and I've tried dozens of different brands. 

This glides on easily, doesn't feel greasy and I don't burn at all. There is a light barrier left on the face after application, which I don't mind. Much better for me than lotion or serum type sunscreen that eventually turns to grease on my face. Bonus points for not being a liquid, which makes it perfect for flying. Worth the trip to a local Ulta given that it's been sold out online for a while. * I love the unseen for my face and i was so hyped when they came out with a body version but in application that one was way too oily for someone like me who uses it when im outside working and sweating. But this? THIS!? Perfect for applying on tattoos (which i have) and its not oily. The viscosity of this is perfect if you're like me and really only show your arms. It obviously works since my tattoos haven't felt like they're about to burn off now. * I am terrible at putting on sunscreen- but this stick has changed the game for me! So easy to travel with, and if I forget to apply it at home it just takes seconds to apply wherever I am! No strong scent, not tacky, not oily! The best! * I've been looking for an SPF that doesn't leave my face too glowy and this is perfect! It glides on super smooth and as the name indicates, its invisible! * i bought this as SOON as i saw that supergoop had more sunscreen sticks, and omg its perfect, along with the attributes from before (travel friendly, perfect for all skin types, good for poc), its also long lasting! the only downside is its spf 40, and the orher new one, the sheer mineral stick, is even lower at spf 30, i'm not sure why they're different but it works and i LOVE it, will definitely repurchase :)"

I have medium - tan skin so I have a hard time finding sunscreens that dont make me look like I have unblended white on my face. This tint is perfect and not overpowering. This is great for people who want a natural look and sun protection. I dont feel greasy or oily either. * This is my everyday sunscreen. It has a slight tint which is perfect for me even with my fair skin. With this, a little spot concealer, blush, brow tint and mascara, im good for the day. I do set with a light setting powder and it wears beautifully. I purchased almost 4 times already and will continue to do so. Great product * This burns my skin. I'm 58 with sensitive skin. The ""mineral"" sold me. 
Also it's a dark tint. Not for fair skin. * This is the only sunscreen that ive repurchased 5x. Im brown skinned and this doesnt leave a white cast, blends so easily and blurs any imperfections. Will always be my everyday sunscreen! Please never discontinue! * I have combination to oily skin. Every face sunscreen I've used would make my face feel super oily before it is time to reapply. This sunscreen doesn't make me oily and my face still feels soft. It doesnt clog up my pores like other face sunscreens. I have used sunbum, blue lizard, and little hands. I love these bc they dont irritate my skin. Bliss block star is the only one that doesnt leave streaks. Of course if swimming I would use the others since block star isnt meant for it. * I love this sunscreen! that being said, I am pretty tan. if I was pale, this sunscreen will show up dark on your skin. I love it! but I'm a medium brown woman. * I love this sunscreen and how it makes my skin look. I just wish it had a lighter shade because it makes me look orange😭"

Now anytime I put it on my skin turned hot and itchy like crazy. I love this brand and has other products from them with no issue. Not sure why my skin doesn't like this. * Non greasy sun protection that works well alone and under makeup. Does blend in with your skin color and slightly blurs skin brown spots and blemishes. * Hey Ulta, Dimethicone is a silicone. This product should not come up with your silicone free search filter. * I dont really like SPF's they break my skin out but i do love this one. I wear it under makeup and it does make my makeup a little more oily but i just add a little more setting powder to my routine and dont notice a difference. This product has great ingredients and doesnt break my skin out!! The onlt SPF i'll use * Out of all the brands I've tried through working at Ulta, Dermalogica has the BEST SPF! This one is mineral and blends right into you're skin with no white cast, which is hard to find. Esthetician approved :) * Sunscreens breakout my skin out so badly- but not this one!  Plus, it's a mineral sunscreen that isn't heavy and has ZERO white cast. I love that it softens out the appearance of my pores and lines- for no makeup days- but doesn't pill with makeup! * Gifted by Dermalogica- I've always been a big fan of their skin care products so I knew I had to try their sunscreen. The sample size I received was perfect for my travel bag or to throw in my purse when needed. It doesn't leave a white cast and blends super easily without irritating my sensitive skin."
150,150,150,150,black girl sunscreen,make it glow continuous spray spf30,pimprod2032832,2597427," * The best sunscreen for me. * I bought this just to use to go to the beach, but the next morning my skin looked so good. I started using it daily as part of my morning routine and I get compliments all the time about my skin. I saw someone didn't like that you couldn't spray directly to the face but honestly as an oily skin girl, it really should be rubbed into the skin, otherwise it just sits on top very dewy. I am at work at 7 and normally oily by 1 but since using this, I have a nice glow but significantly less oily than I am bare faced. I also don't wear makeup to work, drink lots of water, and barely get 6 hours sleep. So I promise you it really is the sunscreen because my habits have gotten worst but my face is still improving from being acne prone and very sensitive. They make a version specifically for face I want to try. * Love this product, i spray a little in my hand and rub into my face, neck, chest and arms for an amazing glow. My coworker kept saying this is something extremely beautiful about your skin…had to share my secret lol * You will only be able to spray your full body two times with this sunscreen. Too expensive for the size. * I think it's important to mention that reading directions before using a product is very important. Unfortunately that's not what I did. I sprayed this directly on my face and it clearly states in a direction to spray in your hands and then apply to your face which I believe defeats the purpose as to why I bought this product because I want it that I can spray on my face without disrupting my make up if that's what you're looking for this is not it but I do believe this is a great product to have to spray on your neck and body. * This was a good spf for the body! Its just not enough product. I only used this maybe 7 or 8 times and the product was gone.. and I know I didnt spray too much. I don't this the price is worth the product amount. * I love to sunscreen especially for going out because the sheen looks so nice on brown skin. It's also easy to apply. I love the way sunscreen smells in general, so it didn't bother me at all. Wish the bottle was a little larger though."

Thankfully it doesn't last long so I can go about my day unbothered by it except for the initial application. * This is just okay. Alone its fine but under make up its terrible. Wheb i out foundation on top of this it slides all over mu face and makes me look muddy. * I bought this on sale and love it! It leaves you with a pearly glow… if you're daur skin might not be for you since it has an apricot finish… add some bronzing drops and this was all I needed for coverage and sun protection. * I was excited to try this because I love the other force sheild sunscreen, but it made me look orange!! Formula feels the same as the green one. I have really fair skin (Mac studio fix NC10 for reference). Similar to the pigment in the redness reducing rescue hero, just too much color for my skin & I don't tan in the summer. So sadly I will be returning. Would recommend for medium/fair and darker complexions!! * This is really good by itself, I havent put it on under my makeup. I received a sample when I ordered some other Hero products. I liked this sample so much, I ordered it :) Hero is a great brand as is but this stuff gives a great glow and protection. I use this on my face, neck, and chest. I'll use regular over the counter sunscreen for my body. Try it! * I have to use mineral spf. Chemical makes me break out or burn my eyes. This does neither. I first tried Hero's green spf. That one is nice if you have very fair skin. So when I saw this one I decided to give it a try. It feels nice on. Didn't dry down tight and does not break me out. It took me a few weeks to like it. At first when you put it on, it does come across very bronze but after 10 min. you are left glowy but your skin tone. The only thing I wish Hero would do is disclose the source of their mica. That's important to a lot of people or should be anyways. * Very nice light weight spf. Nice little tint that does help even a bit of redness and before fully drying down, I could actually see the pearl, but it's very subtle. It also doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, so I will definetly be using this from now on. Super pretty!"

It's so smooth on my skin and mixes well with my other skincare products! It also does well with my eczema, I recommend this. * I love this sunscreen! On my deeper complexion it gives me a very nice matte finish and glow.
It is the last thing I put on my when I leave out the door Every Day. * I'm not sure what is in this peoduct but it causes my eyes to burn * Feels very light and goes on clear and smooth! * I liked this sunscreen, it did everything it was supposed to. As expected, there was 0 whitecast. A problem was that I felt it wasn't as good of a deal as their other sunscreens which provide more product and costs less, which was rather annoying. Additionally, the texture was rather annoying and felt very watery while leaving a greasy finish. I would recommend the moisturizing lotion version of this sunscreen since it leaves a beautiful finish and costs less. * I'm glad I decided to purchase this sunscreen dispite the mid reviews I've seen for this product. It goes on like a dream! It's a gel yhat dries done to a matte finish that's not at all ashy. Compared to Supergoop, which for some reason gets highly rated, this product works with my makeup without turning it into a complete oil slick. I also tried BeautyStat universal C skin refiner vitamin c serum + SPF 50 sunscreen. It's almost 4x the price and it is an absolute ash fest! * Love it"
154,154,154,154,supergoop!,mineral sheerscreen spf 30,pimprod2029938,2589387," * I am in shock at the bad reviews 😂 I am a 30 y.o. brownskin black women and this product works perfect for my combination, acne prone skin. Not sure what smell the negative reviews are referring to - if anything it smells very neutral, barely has a smell. I have used other SPFs that I had to wash off and throw away because of the overwhelming smell but that is not the case with this product. As far blending and applying under makeup, it is 100% effective. I think some people are not using it properly or are not prepping the skin properly or the SPF is not compatible with the skincare products others are using. I have used this SPF on top of PCA skin and Face Reality. I have routine appts with my esthetician who introduced me to this SPF and I have never looked back. A little goes a long and if you have a white cast, you more than likely used too much. I sometimes apply too much but I am able to blend it out which removes the white cast. 10/10 for me! * I used their matte mineral sunscreen for almost 2 years, but as I've started to reach my 30s, my skin is getting more dry. So having my sunscreen be ""matte"" was no longer a priority. My skin is sensitive so I had to stick to mineral sunscreen, so I decided to try this one. Every mineral sunscreen I've tried has a slight white cast, and you're not going to get away from that with this product either. However it is blendable as it claims to be. 
This one works better with my makeup than the matte sunscreen did. My makeup doesn't seperate over the top of it. 
Id say to give it a try & see if it works for you! * Looked awful under makeup. Foundation would not blend causing a patchy mess.  Had to return. * This sunscreen has great ingredients for oily and acne, prone skin like mine. However, it absolutely leaves a white cast, and started pilling almost immediately. I prepped my skin properly, including moisturizer prior, and it started pilling right away. Definitely returning. * I never know how I'm going to react to facial sunscreen but this works just fine! It didn't irritate my sensitive skin and it didn't burn my eyes either. I does act like a primer as previous reviewers mentioned and didn't make me greasy after several hours of wear. I mixed bronzing drops in with it and used it as a light makeup for casual days. It is however overpriced in my opinion but what isn't these days? * Wow! I am so in love. Super sheer and soft. No white cast. Does not clog my pores or irritation my sennsitive, acne prone skin. I have tried many sunscreens and this one is by far my favorite. I apply over my water based Peach & Lily skincare routine and it glides and blends right into my skin. I'm obsessed! * I am now a daily sunscreen user thanks to this product. I have sensitive acne prone skin and this sunscreen does not irritate or clog my pores. I have tried sunscreens from Neutrogena, La Roche Posay, Shiseido, but they have not worked well for my skin. I felt it left my face oily and clogged my pores. I have been using Supergoop mineral sunscreen for 9 months now and I love it! I love how it feels, how it makes my skin glow, how it's hydrating, how it can be a primer, and I love that it is mineral. I don't notice a smell and it's never left a white cast on my face . For reference I am hispanic and my skin tone is light beige. I always recommend this product to friends wanting to starting their sunscreen journey."

I felt like I rubbed toothpaste all over myself. * My dermatologist recommended this mineral sunscreen. I was previously on la roche posay spf face moisturizer but since it wasnt mineral, my doc wanted me to switch. Instant horrible white cast which was quite comical. It smells like rubber tires. I broke out in a rash by day 2, my skin feels like reptile skin. Took a break on day 3 but on day 4 it burned after i applied it. It pills and was blotchy on my skin. Im officially done with this spf. * Has a white cast that just doesnt rub in. Not worth the hassle * Does not absorb into my skin. Makes my face look very greasy * I mistakenly only brought this to a wedding. Im very fair but it was so white and sticks on everything. Left a terrible residue. Will transfer onto your clothes. It felt like you could rub it in for hours and it still wouldn't be any better. * bad white cast and peeling * Horrible white cast. Lord help you if you are wearing black clothes. This even got all over my Fitbit band and was difficult to get off. I love every other Cereve product I've used, so I'm really disappointed with this one. May be fine for specific activities. But I hate it for daily wear."

But it is irritating and burning my eyes, even when I don't apply it anywhere near my eyes. I look like I cried all day, not cute. * I honestly appreciate my friend who is a esthetician and recommended me this sunscreen. I am on a trip to Cancun at the moment and I know the uv rays do not play! It really is the best sunscreen ever! * I love how easily this absorbs and isnt greasy at all. It is very gentle on the skin and when used on my face, no breakouts. However unless this is on sale it is not worth the price. Even at half off its a little expensive. There are other products that have the same positives but a fraction of the price. * The best sunscreen brand I've ever used. It has more types of sun protection than other brands. * I used this spray for one day out at the pool, and it ran out while I was reapplying it the 3rd time. The price is not worth it for one day. Just get the liquid one and rub it in, either way this one sprays white and you have to rub it in eithet way. * Sprays white foam but great to use before applying your makeup if you want a dewy look * I am extremely fair , while my husband has a darker olive skin tone. We wore this out for 2 hours ( i re applied 3 times my husband once) and both of us got extremely burnt. ( my husband normally never wears sunscreen 🙃)I bought this as a reef safe sunscreen and will not be repurchasing. Never in my life have i had a sunscreen that simply didnt work. I bought the one for face and had NO ISSUE."

Really glad to find something that is SPF 50 and clean. Must have for face care, and love that Kopari has the best body spf so one stop shop. * I am in love with this product and use it everyday for both my SPF and makeup for summer.  It is so lightweight and feels so lightweight. * My curent fav SPF - as someone with super sensitive acne prone skin i love how this wears and almost makes my skin softer * I love it!! < 3 * Im very sensitive to any kelp, algae, astaxanthin as they give me deep and painful pimples. I thought as i was safe as the offending ingredient is listed next to last, but no. Four large zits two days after use.  Its the only new thing in the routine and im sadly going to hanf it to a friend. * As a brown girl, this didn't leave a white or grey cast on me, however it's sooooo glittery. If you're into that, you will love it. Unfortunately the glitter/sparkles were too much for me. Bummer, because I really liked the formula! * Do your research before picking a sunscreen. Super sensitive friendly, and the slight tint it does have worked for me."

I never dry out and flake whilst using this. Sometimes my skin feels cleaner after wearing it. I always glow. Don't know what I'd do if they discontinued this! * Please don't ever stop making this product is all I got to say … love it!!! * I love this product. I love that is very light on my face, because I hate heavy foundations. Medium matches my perfectly. This product is moisturizing and doesn't create flakes. My skin is just glowing when I wear it. And I always get compliments when I wear this product! * First time purchasing this product an I'm happy with it. * I've tried lots of different sunscreens and they all burned my skin . This has been great for sensitive , acne prone skin , smells great , and doesn't leave a white cast. A little goes a long way. * I now need a 50 factor but hate how gloopy most high protection products are. This serum glides on and adds a little colour and healthy glow, without shine. Better than pure tinted moisturisers for cover and perfect for a light daytime look."

I have been using it for the past 7 days and I like the fact that it's organic, uses all natural ingredients, and doesn't leave white streak marks and it stays all day. I am very pleased think I found my new one for the summer! I like how it absorbs into the skin and doesn't build up like some of the others I've used in the past. I also love the fact that it's cruelty free and vegan and has a lot of healthy ingredients such as Prickly Pear Extract, Raspberry Seed Oil, and Buriti Oil. And safe for the environment and Hawaii Reef Compliant so unique and I'm so happy to try such a lovely product. Definitely I recommend and will look at other products from the COOLA family!! * First off I absolutely love this. I love that it's not oily or sticky like most other sunscreens. This product is by far one of my favorite sun screens. One thing about this sunscreen is you can barely even tell you are wearing it and it honestly feels hydrating, this is perfect for anyone that is outside a lot or looking for the perfect sunscreen to protect your skin from sun burn and damage! The scent isn't overpowering and as a mom this is my go to sunscreen and I've noticed that it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated! This product is a must have if you're looking for sunscreen that doesn't smell over powering and leaves your skin feeling hydrated but also protects your skin from sunburns and damage ! I highly recommend this sunscreen!

**This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I am absolutely SPF-obsessed. When it comes to sunscreen, particularly for the body, I have a stringent set of criteria. Thankfully, Coola's Peach Blossom Body Sunscreen ticks off all the right boxes. This product seamlessly blends into the skin, eliminating that dreaded sticky, greasy feeling that often accompanies other sunscreens. Instead, it leaves behind a beautifully hydrated finish, which is exactly the radiant look I always aim for. The scent is subtle yet sweet, adding a touch of luxury to the application experience. And let's not overlook the SPF 70 protection level – talk about serious sun defense! If you're on the hunt for a top-tier sunscreen that delivers on both performance and sensory delight, I highly recommend giving this one a try.

This review was collected as part of a promotion * As a mom and someone who tries to avoid getting sunburned this body sunscreen is the best I've ever tried! For starters it is 70% organic. The ingredients, sustainability and overall what the product stands by is absolutely incredible. Living in NC with the fluctuations of temp and weather, I had the privilege to try it out and it gave me the best sunscreen coverage and on top of that the application process was extremely easy! This sunscreen has a smell of peaches which smells amazing and on top of that reminds you of the beach as well. Another thing I loved about this product was the fact that it wasn't sticky or hard to apply. It rubbed in so smoothly. I applied it everyday 15 mins before going out. If you have a toddler who has sensitivity like my little one does this product is great. Every two hours I reapplied it on her and myself and it worked absolutely great! * Skincare is very important to me. On my days off from work I spend a lot of time outside. Whether it's taking my kids to the park or spending time gardening, I make sure to apply sunscreen. It's difficult finding the right sunscreens. COOLA Peach Blossom Classic Body Sunscreen SPF 70 is a great choice for those who are looking for lightweight sunscreen. I like that it's not too thick or sticky and It blends easily, absorbs pretty quick and I love that it doesn't leave a white cast. It's a plus that it has organic ingredients. I prefer unscented products because most scents can be overwhelming but I actually like the peach blossom scent it's not overpowering at all.   The scent wears off pretty quick, which is perfect for me. The other thing I like is that when you squeeze the bottle the hole is quite small and can control the amount of product that gets squeezed out. I also noticed that it leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I'm honestly happy with this product and highly recommended. This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I tried out the COOLA Peach Blossom Classic Body Sunscreen SPF 70, and let me tell you, it's pretty awesome. This stuff isn't your average sunscreen I've been around a lot of cosmetics while working at a makeup store and this product is like a little slice of paradise in a bottle.First off, sun protection. With SPF 70, you're getting serious defense against those pesky UV rays. Whether you're just chilling on the beach or just running errands, COOLA Peach Blossom has got your back literally. let's talk about the smell. Oh man, it's heavenly. The sweet scent of fresh peaches mixed with a hint of floral. It smells like summer in a bottle, seriously. The best part it's reef friendly and free of all those nasty chemicals. So you can feel good about using it, knowing you're not harming the environment.Application is great, it goes on smooth and absorbs quickly without leaving you feeling greasy. Plus, the packaging is cute and travel friendly, so you can take it with you wherever you go.Bottom line, this sunscreen is game changer.

I have dry/sensitive skin so the fact that i didnt have trouble introducing this into my skin care routine nor any breakouts is everything 🤌🏽🤌🏽 * I have been trying to find the perfect spf for almost 6 months. I think I've finally found the perfect one 😍 absolutely shocked how good this looks under makeup. It makes your makeup flawless with a natural finish. I'm extremely picky and this stuff is the best. * I love this sunscreen but why is it almost 30 dollars for such a small bottle? I love that this sunscreen doesn't peel and doesn't leave a white cast on my face but why so expensive? * EVERY sunscreen breaks me out or itritates my skin, so im very hesitant to try new products. However, this sunscreen so far has not broken me out (a miracle). I do experience a very mild burning sensation on the delicate areas of my face, but nothing compared to other sunscreens. I also agree with another reviewer - this did cause some burning in my eyes. * This sunscreen is light weight and goes on smooth. It comes in a cute bottle too! But…wouldnt recommend to wear on days you might sweat. It made my eyes burn a bit. Other than that, i like it! * Ive struggled really hard in the past to get into using sunscreen everyday especially on my face because i would always break out from others. This one however is a game changer. The formula is super lightweight and does not clog my pores or cause me to break out. It soaks into the skin nicely so it doesnt leave a white cast and it feels good in my skin. It doesnt feel like im using sunscreen but like im using skincare products. It is worth every penny if you have problems with breaking out from sunscreen because this one does NOT. * I really like this sunscreen. However, the price for 2.2 ounces isn't something I like. If you apply the amount of sunscreen you actually need to protect your skin from the sun, this little bottle will be gone in a couple weeks. I don't know if I'll repurachse it because of that."
167,167,167,167,cocokind,daily spf 32 mineral facial sunscreen,pimprod2024049,2582487," * i had really high hopes for this sunscreen. it's definitely not perfect, but definitely better than others i have tried. i am usually the lightest shade in all makeup products, and it still leaves a white cast on me, so proceed with caution. i did like it for the most part, as someone with sensitive and acne-prone skin, this did not break me out, which was really nice. * I love this sunscreen! It's gentle, long-lasting, and doesn't feel like it makes my skin oily afterwards. I wish this came in a bigger bottle though! * The best mineral face sunscreen I have found. Other sunscreens cause irritation to my skin, maybe it is the non-nano sized mineral particles that makes my skin like this one. I have a dry skin type and this leaves my skin smooth and plump, and sometimes dewy depending on the environment. It layers well with moisturizer or other skincare and makeup. It leaves the slightest white cast but it's a mineral sunscreen, that's what you get. * I have been using this product for about a month now consistently/majority of the time. I needed new products as I am currently 6 months pregnant and I was having a horrible reaction to the products I was using. I also have very sensitive skin and multiple allergies, so skin care has always been a struggle for me. 

Since starting these products, my face has been so smooth, no reactions/breakouts and I have noticed a difference in my skin overall. I am really hoping the results stay the same after pregnancy. 

Below is my routine. I wait 2-5 minutes before applying the next product. 

MORNING:
La Roche-Posay Toleriane Foaming Face Wash (does not leave my face feeling stripped or dry, size is worth the money)

cocokind Vitamin C Glow Brightening Serum 
(sometimes there is a very slight burn but nothing that is concerning or leaves any after affects such as burns or spots on the face)

Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Moisturizer (was worried about using this product but my skin has been handling it perfectly)

cocokind Daily SPF 32 Mineral Facial Sunscreen (no burn, as long as you use the right amount it does not cake on thick. I use 2-3 fingers of product)

NIGHT:
La Roche-Posay Toleriane Foaming Face Wash

cocokind Vitamin C Glow Brightening Serum

Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water
Gel Moisturizer * There is a white cast and i did try to rub it in for like 2 mins and I couldn't blend it out. Maybe will work better under makeup?? * I dont know what ingredient does this, but this made my face appear oddly red. This wasnt a sun burn red, this was like a skin barrier destroying type of red. I discontinued use after a week because i was getting many comments about having a ""red face"". It took about 1 month for my skin to return back to its baseline skin color. Wouldnt recommend this to people. Theres something harsh and not normal in it. I wear sunscreen daily, i tried this new one as my usual was out of stock, and this was the only one thats done this to me * There has to be something else out there that doesnt burn when it accidently gets it your eyes. I wont ever buy this again because the pain is that bad. Without fail, you will get some in your eyes then have to suffer. 
also, it leaves a white cast. 
There just has to be something better than this."
168,168,168,168,olehenriksen,banana bright mineral face sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2042274,2617219," * Only purchased once and probably wont again. Tried to love it * At first I loved this sunscreen. It has a great finish that is both matte and glowy. But as the day went on I noticed it was drying. Its also scented which I didnt like and is always a red flag for sensitive skin people like myself (and most people who use mineral SPF…) also the tint could look a little streaky depending on your complexion. Wanted to love but ultimately returned. * Loved it in the beginning but saw it had fragrance. I have really sensitive skin so over time it made my skin really dry at the end which is shocking considering i have oily combo skin. No white white cast which is a bonus! Would've been perfect if it had no fragrance. * I was so interested in trying this sunscreen, and it's just okay. The scent is really nice and doesn't irritate my skin, and it gives a pretty glow. My only problems are that it can make the skin feel dry, which is odd, for it leaving the skin looking dewy. And it is the worst under makeup. It pills and leaves the skin looking flaky. It's just a good sunscreen if you don't wear base makeup or no makeup at all. * I was very grateful to learn that my SPF sensitivity was most likely caused by chemical sunscreen, and that mineral sunscreen may not burn me the same way. This one holds up! Felt very moisturizing and went on smoothly, no burning and no watery eyes. However, it did pill quite a bit when i applied makeup over it. I'm not sure if this is because i was mixing oil and water based products, but i will keep experimenting. If you are just looking for an everyday sunscreen, i would definitely recommend. * This is hands down the best mineral sunscreen I've tried, and I've tried a lot. It doesnt leave a white/purple cast, but its also not pigmented. It doesnt have that chalky feeling that a lot of mineral sunscreens have either. It leaves a really nice glowy finish, but not greasy. I have sensitive skin but havent had any issues with this. Only con is the smell, its pretty strong but not terrible. It is a mineral sunscreen, so you can feel it more on your skin than chemical sunscreens but not too bad. I havent noticed any issues with makeup either. I wait 5-10 minutes after moisturizer to apply this, then wait another 5-10 before starting makeup. * I don't know what witchcraft is in this bottle but it totally changes the appearance of my skin (in a good way lol). It's even and dewey and clear. I no longer wear my tinted lotion because my skin looks so good with just this sunscreen on. Will buy for life."
169,169,169,169,dermalogica,clear start clearing defense moisturizer spf 30,pimprod2006536,2547226," * I used this as a cheaper alternative toy usual SPF  but it was greasy and broke me out. If i dont shake it i can see the oil. * I bought this sunscreen on accident because I thought it was a free gift and didn't check until I picked it up in store. However, I decided to use it because I needed a new sunscreen and surprisingly, this worked very well for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it sits on top of my other skin care products very well. This is also the first sunscreen that hasn't irritated my skin or burned my eyes which I truly appreciate because every sunscreen I've worn in the past had an extremely painful reaction on my eyes. I plan on repurchasing. * I use this product for daily use. It is lightweight and keeps your face clear and oil free. * i'm so glad i found this sunscreen! beginning with the biggest pros for me- i've seen no new breakouts, doesn't pill, and feels like nothing on my skin. i really hate when i can feel an spf on my face but with this product my skin feels light and clean. pilling and clinging to dry patches is very annoying and i've noticed ZERO pilling/exaggerating of dry patches. 

the few cons i have are very nitpicky- fairly strong smell and isn't mattifying. the smell is almost floral but mostly is just a normal sunscreen smell, which isnt a huge deal to me but might be too much for those sensitive to fragrance. i also wouldn't consider this a mattifying products which i actually prefer. theres little to no added shine but again, not very mattifying.

overall i'm so glad i finally found an spf that works on my skin! * Considering I have very oily skin, this didnt moisturize my skin at all. I had to use it as a straight up sunscreen over my regular moisturizer which defeated the purpose for me. It was defined mattifying to the point of drying. * I do my best to avoid sun exposure to my face, so I am always applying sunscreen. This works really well, it's not runny like some other suncreens for your face and I like the way it smells. I feel that it works really well and don't notice any redness or irritation eithet! * I didnt like this at all! It leaves my skin so oily. It also feels very heavy. The only pro about this is there is no white cast."

I'm multicultural and have melonated skin.

** The longest memoir version of a review below is what's worked for me, tips, and why I'm using it as a dollar-stretching multi-tasker for all skin. Recommended for all skin tones and ethnicities. It's one of FEW products that offers 50 SPF for both face AND body in a healthy, noncommogenic blend and has stayed reasonably affordable despite competitors. 

The Black Girl Magic Hybrid 50 SPF IS one of the best sunscreens EVER  - yes it does take a learning curve to dispense small amounts of the liquid-consistency lotion because of the packaging but DON'T let that deter you from such a healthy, full-coverage product. Best of both worlds, covering face and body easily and at a dope price, high SPF, and a little goes a loooooong way! Be patient.....

When you first apply this to your skin it should be the LAST step in whatever your personal process might be, depending on if you're toning, serums, and moisturizing you want to give those other steps at least 30 seconds to 1 minute to absorb into your skin. Then apply this SPF last. You will notice a white cast initially, but it has to process - just like all of us. Give it a minute to absorb into your skin and then look in the mirror because you're going to look and feel like a delicious rockstar  : )

I'm usually indoors throughout the workdays. I apply about a dime size on a reusable cloth face pad and gently swipe then dap over face and neck/breast and some of the top shoulder area - this helps me preserve the sunscreen and not overapply it. I know this is redundant but GENTLY apply/swipe/dab, not wiping or pulling the skin or product too aggressively or too quickly. Then use a little larger amount with hands if needing for allover coverage depending on the day/activities/clothing.

Let it absorb and then continue with your day . 

*Don't assume to apply this and then go about your day outside immediately - within 15 mins you should be about ready to go outside with this glow protection-factor - AFTER the white cast absorbs. 

Humbly put your pride and ego to the side when reapplying later in the day because the sunscreen needs to absorb into the skin again and then it becomes invisible.  If you're wanting a purely sheen/invisible look without the zest of glow, go to the bathroom until it absorbs 1st, or just ignore caring that others might notice that you're protecting your skin.. : ) ... and/or try the brand Supergoop Unseen - but downside on that is it's a smaller container, less SPF, more expensive, and a one or the other type of sunscreen whereas *Black Girl Magic Hybrid is quality AND value for both face AND body,  and keeps skin looking and feeling on point,  glowing,  healthy and protected, not clogging or masking feeling. WINNING! 

I suggest using Black Girl Magic Hybrid 50 at home before the day starts and trying the Supergoop Unseen as travel/on the go option for reapplying sunscreen throughout the day.  

Black Girl Magic Hybrid 50 sunscreen is for skin. All skin. Regardless of tone, shade, or hue, this sunscreen is a must have! 

Thanks for reading * The consistency is so loose and liquidy. I hate it! This one also leaves a white cast which to me defeats the purpose of its name. I usually buy the og one, but it was completely sold out. They need to work on the formula of this one. * This is a pretty decent sunscreen! There are plenty of comments about it being runny & leaving a white cast. Please know what youre putting on your face before you do so! Do your research because ALL mineral suncreen is runny & leave a slight white cast. Black girl suncreen is by far the best mineral suncreen I have used. It is not drying and doesnt leave too bad of a white cast. If you know how to work with mineral sunscreen this js perfect for you!! Amazing!!!! They knew exactly what they were doing :) * I usually buy the spf 30, but decided to go for this one as I just saw it had an spf of 50…worst decision I could've made!!! This spf is the worst I think I've ever tried, the consistency is EXTREMELY runny and if you're not careful it will spill/a lot will come out at once. And the smell…THE SMELL!!! Usually I don't mind fragrances at all, but this one is terrible (especially for being ""fragrance free""). It also leaves the worst white cast which defeats the whole purpose of the brand! Absolutely would NOT recommend!!! * Black girl sunscreen. Works great  , love it , wouldn't buy any other sunscreen  smell wonderful * This sunscreen was legitimately the first product I have disliked enough to write a review for. I bought it and tried it right away in my car and right away I noticed it was very fragrant for being fragrant free. I squeezed it into my hands and it was really runny unlike the other Black Girl Sunscreens I have tried. So I tried to put my usual amount (two fingers) of sunscreen and I sat there looking crazy rubbing this in. then while I was doing this the product leaked all over my car. I cried. * The 30/45 SPFs are great. 50 SPF is not even close—leaves a white cast defeating the purpose of the brand and is NOT FF. Doesn't contain synthetic fragrance but a natural fragrance (lavender EO) is still a fragrance and it's STRONG. Returning ASAP."

I have dry, mature skin and this sits well on the skin. * Very good skincare and skinshield product. Easy to apply, pleasant and smooth feeling. The color is very nice and it is sheer enough to fit most skin tones. I just wish it had a more mat finish. * I love this sunscreen. It doesn't take a lot to get full facial coverage and I have no problem with white cast. I just wish I didn't have to rub it in as much but I still have no problem with the product lightening my complexion. Definitely recommend!! * love the finish, gives me a barely there glow. the only issues with this product is that the texture isn't light so it takes a few minutes of rubbing and spreading the product in. * It feels amazing and smooth on the skin for a mineral sunscreen. I really like the fact it is mineral and 50 spf. If you have very fair skin you probably will not be able to wear this. I really hope they will create more shades because this is such a good sunscreen product. I feel like I can't wear this unless I have a bit of a tan because the shade is too dark. I also really don't like the smell at all. It smells like play dough, but since I really like the way it feels I'm willing to get over that. The smell goes away in about 30 minutes so it's not that bad. Please add more shades!! * Oh wow! I just got this and so far I'm really happy. I have light/fair skin with a neutral undertone that sometimes looks a bit golden/yellow. White casts look obvious on me because although my skin is light, it has some warmth in the undertones.. So far no light cast from this baby * Love it and it's mineral l, not chemical. Does r irritate the eyes either."

The tint is just a hint if color for me (I'm light to med complextion).  I look glowy and dewy.  Its great when don't want to wear foundation.  Mineral sunscreen is so hard to find without the white cast.  This has none of it.  It's definatelu worth a try.  This is my go to sunscreen from now on. * Needed a sunscreen like this. They are either changing the packaging or changing the other formula of another of their sunscreens so I tried this one, it's literally perfect.  I love the skin tint I feel so confident with it and nothing else on, the redness correcting is perfect * Sodium Benzoate is used as a preservative to prevent food from molding. In this form it is safe, however, scientists have shown that negative side-effects occur when it is mixed with Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C). Their studies indicate that it then turns into Benzene, a known carcinogen * Im someone who suffers from acne scars :/ although this product doesnt exactly cover up my acne scars, it really makes the appearance look lighter (if I wanted to cover up my acne scars I'd be wearing a full coverage foundation) I think it's just a plus that it does make my acne scars look less severe!! 

This product doesnt burn my eyes and it really blends seamlessly into my skin. After awhile i do get oily BUT i am an oily skinned girl. Im also light - med skin tone so i cant say that yes or no that this blends in the best with other skin tones. It blends with mine! 

Honestly my go to sunscreen when i want a little bit of something but dont feel like layering moisturizer, sunscreen, and skin tint. It also doesnt pill up! (For me at least! I found as long as im not layering a lot of products underneath it doesnt pill. I found when layering actives such as benzoyl peroxide+clindamycin creme under it does pill up and get patchy.) * The color match was fine, but this sunscreen was way too drying for my sensitive skin. Alas, it's going back. * After a few days of using this I noticed my skin appearance overall started to improve. Truly protects from the sun and has a flawless finish. * This stuff is so good. After a few days of use, I noticed my rosacea start to subside considerably. Highly recommend this."

BThey should take this word out of the name, it is misleading.  Also it smells a bit unpleasant which mostly dissipates.
It did give me sun protection but I can get that from a much less expensive product.
Overall a disappointment. * I am a very tan latina who has gone through tons of sunscreen trying to find one with no white cast that actually gives protection. While the price point is steep, it is 100% worth it. You can't go wrong with any of Murad's sunscreens. Love this more than the hydrating purple one because that one smells awful! * Product causes white casting. * This is the first sunscreen I have used that is in the texture of a serum. I like that because it has the consistency of a serum it is not very thick and applies easily. I didn't think this felt greasy but I have used many mineral sunscreens and am used to the way they wear. If you are not you may not like the way it feels on the skin. I felt this product absorbed well and didn't just sit on top of my skin. * love this stuff so much. my skin looks so so good after using it. it's not too scented either which i love! i love how it protects my skin and that it doesn't give a white cast. i love that it's spf 45 instead of the usual 30! * This was sent to me by the brand but my opinions are my own - this is such a unique SPS, I love the texture on the way that it applies. It plays nicely with my other skin care and make up so that means no pilling or separating. I've worn this for a while and haven't had any issues with my skin, it doesn't feel greasy or weighed down. How do you make sure that I let it really sink in before I apply my make up! It does have a little bit of a white cast that dissipates after a while. I would definitely recommend this! Remember to wear your SPF"
174,174,174,174,pacifica,vegan collagen every day lotion spf 30,pimprod2017151,2566493," * I've used this through a couple of bottles. My skin takes time to adjust to products (hence why the couple of bottles). 

I love that it is cruelty free and has vegan collagen. I love that it has SPF 30, a must for me, BUT it smells like sunscreen. It is definitely moisturizing, I don't have an issue with dry skin, BUT it's rather greasy. My daughter has even commented that my face is really greasy when I wear it (not really the vibe I'm going for). The chemicals burn my eyes as the day goes on. If I even wipe my eyes, it takes me minutes to wipe away whatever traces of this moisturizer is around my eyes. If I regularly wore makeup, this would be extra problematic. If you wear contacts, I do not recommend this. Imagine that burning getting caught up under your contacts.

I really, really wanted to love this because I didn't want to go through having my skin adjust to a new product, but I can't justify it based on it being a habit. * As mentioned by others, this would be more accurately described as ""SPF 30 sunscreen with collagen."" Smells exactly like a normal drugstore sunscreen. It's light and doesn't feel too greasy (but there is still a bit of that feeling). Overall it's ok * Just finished my bottle and ordered another one.  I have sensitive, adult cystic acne, 44 yr old skin that is in the normal to dry stage. This product:
1) has a sunscreen like feel to it when you first apply it, then it fades away
2) has a great glass bottle that you can get ALL of the product out of!
3) Spreads well- at little goes a long way- to much will make it sticky and it won't dry down fast
4) plays well with Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid serum and PUR love your selfie foundation. * I'm getting older, and my skin is changing, and I hate it. My old favorite daily moisturizer/SPF by No. 7 started making me breakout after years of no problems, so I had to search for something new. All the others I tried that claimed to not clog pores also happened to be too drying for my slightly oily but aging but still acne prone and also kinda dehydrated skin (ugh). But the moisture level of this Goldilocks cream is just right. If you have dry or slightly dry skin you will probably like it, if you are 40+ you will probably like it, if you're young and have oily skin you might NOT like it because it is not a light liquid, it's definitely a thick-ish cream. I can tell the fragrance they were trying for was *floral* but it leans more chemical, although it disappears in a minute or two. After application the skin feels moist, but not greasy. Makeup applies perfectly over it with no pilling at all. I somehow manage to not look shiny over the course of the day, which is practically miraculous. It doesn't seem to make me break out, as I've been using it for several weeks with no notable flares. I am relieved to have found my new favorite! * i like how this spf does not leave a white cast like other spfs. Plumped my skin right up and gave it a nice silky glow. * Love the fact its a moisturizer and has spf. Its easy to use and dont need as much since it spreads easily on your skin. I can feel it last for a good amount of time too * I have very sensitive skin and pretty much every facial spf I have tried has burned my face to the point of peeling. This one was no different, strong sunscreen smell, burned my eyes and left a greasy feeling. Will be returning"

It has really helped with less sunspots on my face and helps with not making my hyperpigmentation worse. Cant live without! Love the glow it gives as well. * Pros….
GREAT glow to the skin
Protects face from sun
Cons… 
strong grapefruit? Scent 
Feels very oily on the skin
Maybe feels light weight to some but not for me * Burns eyes * I was a huge fan of their original sun lotion. This reformutation ruined it. It made my skin red everytime I used it. They also removed iron oxides and used aritificial coloring instead."
176,176,176,176,coola,fragrance-free mineral body sunscreen lotion spf 50,pimprod2003905,2541372," * This product is horrible if you have any skin tone except fair. Literally so white and even with 5 minutes of rubbing it into your skin, your skin is grey with stripes of whote because it does not absorb. I have medium tan skin and it makes me look ill. Save your money! * Used this on a trip to Hawaii (this is a reef safe sunscreen) - my kids used it when they went snorkeling. It does leave a white cast on skin, but that is to be expected considering the active ingredients and the high SPF. They came back from the snorkeling trip with a nice tan (we have naturally olive skin, so we tan even with sunscreen) and no burns. I use this regularly on my face to boost the SPF from my daytime moisturizer. It does not feel greasy and it doesn't appear shiny at all. There is an almost imperceptible (not visible in photographs) white cast, but I can live with that. I also use it on the backs of my hands and arms to prevent a ""car tan"" and it has worked well for that so far. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and I would buy it again. * Do not buy! I'm actually headed to Ulta right now to return this. It'll leave a white cast on any skin tone! And it doesn't blend into the skin no matter how much you rub it in. It's also really dry feeling. Skip this product all together.! * I gave this product one star because it does protect from the sun. But I hated everything else about it. It does not absorb it just sits on top of the skin and it's so white. It's very thick and took a long time to apply. It gets all over everything. Not just your clothes, but anything else you touch or bump into. And it is just as difficult to remove from your skin at the end of the day. I threw this product away after using it a few times. * This is the worst sunscreen I have ever tried. It has a weird, gritty texture and is so hard to rub into the skin. It's also super thick and leaves a very noticable white cast. * A truly reef-safe sunscreen for very, sensitive skin that did not leave a white cast on my dark complexion. It can get white when wet but goes away quickly as you dry. I loved it and it kept my skin soft. * I and my family used this for snorkeling trips that required reef-safe sunscreens. It worked great to protect us from burning. It absorbs better than other mineral sunscreens I have used, but if you use enough to protect you according to the spf rating, you will get a white cast on your skin. I don't think any mineral sunscreen manufacturer should claim that their product is sheer, because to get the spf rating, you will generally have to apply an amount that will show up on your skin. I have sensitive skin and this product did a superb job of providing sun protection as well as a moisture barrier for my skin. I did not get a huge problem with my skin puckering after two hours of swimming in salt water. This product is expensive. I got it on sale. I would never pay full price for this. I suspect it is because of the organic ingredients (not important to me), which probably add nothing to its performance. That plus the ""sheer"" claim caused me to knock one star off the rating. Nonetheless, it delivers pretty solid performance as an spf 60 sunscreen."

I LOVE this sunscreen it is moisturizing while providing sun protection and a BEATIFUL GLOW. It works well under makeup also. I do recommend applying an actual moisturizer on with it because it works as dew drops. It provides great protection.
I rate it 10/10. * I want to give this 5 star, however when I use it, I find I tend to break out a little. Other than that, I absolutely love it. Gives a beautiful glow and protects really well. This has usually been my go-to for sunscreen when we go to the water park, beach, pool or just days I don't want to wear makeup. I will be looking around for other products to try to avoid getting clogged pores that causes the breakouts but I still love this lotion. * I enjoyed the glow this sunscreen gave me, it went on smoothly, and felt ligtht on my skin. 
It did cause a lot of eye irritation after a few hours of wear, so I dont wear it past my eyes. The product is very watery, and it does spill everytime I apply it. 

I did love this as subscreen for mu arms and neck. * Ok, so when I tried this on my face I got a burning sensation after an hour or so. I initially thought it was something else until I realized it only happened when I used the glow 30. It's weird because I'm not allergic to anything in the ingredients so I'm not sure why I'm sensitive to it. So I almost threw this out, when I decided to try it on my arms and legs so that I wouldn't waste any product and OH. MY. GOD. Literally the best glowy body sunscreen ever. It's not glittery and doesn't look like a spray tan. It just gives the most beautiful natural glow with a touch added coverage. I don't get a reaction to it on my body like I do on my face. Note though that I'm very pale so this might not work on deep skin tones. It's also a very runny product so be careful when opening it and squeezing it out because you actually don't need to really squeeze it, the product will just flow right out. It's kind of annoying but also adds to the benefits of it being good for the body because it means that you need to use less product, so even though it's packaged for the face it provides enough product for the body. Also, I've worn this on my college campus all day and it didn't seem to come off until I took a shower, and it didn't stain or rub off on my clothes! The glow lasted all day without it feeling greasy or leaving any residue on fabrics, so long as I'm careful not to get it on my neckline when I'm applying it. Once it sets on the skin it doesn't budge. I initially bought this from Wegman's on clearance but I'm now buying two more bottles from Ulta for the Summer. * this sunscreen is so amazing for when you want a glowy finish! it wears well under makeup and works wonderfully! * I am in the irritated retinol stage, hoping to be over the hump soon. But in the meantime this has been amazing all my tinted moisturizers or foundation look parch ans dry from the retinol. It look so pretty! * This product is so pretty. I get so many compliments about the glow my skin has and this is my last step before I leave my house. I have told several ladies about this beauty secret."

I can throw everything but the kitchen sink at my skin when it comes to exfoliating and my skin takes it beautifully. I used this product daily for about a month and started to see some irritation. Thought it was maybe the change in seasons or my other actives. I cut back on those products and the irritation got worse. Started to look like a rash / dermatitis thats caused by heavy moisturizers. Didnt even think thats it was the sunscreen until it was literally the only ""new"" product on my face. Went back to look at the product more closely. Contains coconut oil, which as an acne prone girly, I know this is very comedogenic / clogs pores / causes dermatitis. Sad because I liked everything else about the product- price, packaging, consistency, absorption, efficacy. Just doesn't work for my skin. 😞 * I started using this sunscreen and I genuinely do like the way it feels on my face and has a pleasent scent! It does protect well considering I was outside for hours and my face did not burned however, if it got into my eyes (just from me rubbing or from sweating) and it would continuously keep burning my eyes. 

I really want to like it however, I may switch back to bare republic mineral sunscreen since I had no issue with that."

It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy.

It smelled like most spray sunscreens do, like chemicals. Once you realize that you can be ready to use it on your face. I wouldn't drench your face, a little bit will go a long way if sprayed correctly. Remember, this is partly a primer, so think of it that way. * I loved thatbthis had sunblock in it but afywr using I dont think this works as a setting spray ;as the spf burned like crazy.) worked fine for arms and chest. Had a very minty fragrance. * Gives some protection but it's very greasy so not good on me since I have oily skin. Also ended up making my eyes burn, might be due to the fragrance. * Big disappointment. I use a lot of Ulta brand products. The tinted face moisturizer with SPF 30 has been my go-to and when I saw this on the Shelf next to it I had high hopes. I sprayed a Mist as directed over my makeup. After allowing it to dry,  I noticed a super greasy and glossy shine to my face. After about 30 minutes of wearing I started to feel a burning in my eyes and my mascara and eyeliner were getting all over the place. I had not touched my eyes but yet this makeup seemed to be a greasy mess anyway! Also the smell is.. unique. Not something I enjoyed using. * I have all the criticisms everyone else has, but if you have tattoos & forget to sunblock up, it's a convenient size to keep in your bag. * for starters, it stinks. i dont even know what to compare it to, it just smells bad. second of all, it sprays out so blotchy, and its greasy. it feels so gross on my skin!"

The coverage feels 100%, but it can be a little masking with a white cast. You will still need to blend it a bit with your fingers. It also works great with dry skin and smells wonderful. * I am allergic to a lot of chemicals on the face and this is the perfect sunscreen for me. Rubs in really nicely, super smooth, and leaves less of a white cast than other zinc sunscreens. Big fan! * There are definitely better sunscreen sticks on the market.

I have oily skin and I hate using face spf for that reason so I wanted to try this instead. I like the light feel and it didn't irritate my skin. * I like that it doesn't have alcohol or a smell like the setting spray version but it is pretty oily when applied. Also wish the SPF was higher. I went though the bottle quick since I kept reapplying before I noticed how oily it made me. It would be great for dry skin girlies. * I think there are better spray sunscreens on the market for a better price. I'm really debating on returning this. I've used it three times, and each time I'm happy with the glow, but it very quickly turns to grease and my makeup slides off. I think for the price, you're better off getting something else. Also, the packaging is pretty but it's not practical. I bought this to put in my pool bag and my hiking pack, but it's glass packaging… I get making sustainable packaging but this isn't practical for what I'm using it for. * Maybe I got a bad bottle but the spritzer clogged up to spray a narrow, hard stream. It was bad news when I sprayed it and it hit me in the eye! * I spray this everyday after my normal skin care and makeup routine. It has a light coconut scent that smells wonderful. I reapply throughout the day to keep feeling fresh and add protection to my skin. * I used it once and my face looked like a tomato within 5 min of spraying it.

I continue to use it because, although the smell is terrible, the formula remains effective and keeps me from burning in intense sun and it's modestly priced for an oil free sunscreen that's high in SPF protection. That's what keeps me coming back. 
Keep in mind, this is a sunscreen lotion and not advertised to be a daily moisturizer. I use another SPF product by the same brand for daily use. I only apply this product prior to outdoor activities. * This is my tride and true. It looks fabuslous on its own and underneath makeup. There is a slight white cast that is eliminated with enough blending. I also notice it helps lessen the amount of sweat thats produced on my face. I workout everyday in an unconditioned gym in the south, need i say more?

This is it * I hate this sunscreen. I thought it would have a flawless finish like all the korean chemical sunscreens I like. It leaves a white cast on my face as if it were a mineral sunscreen and does not completely rub in no matter how much I work it in. And then it does not dry fully either, it just sits on top of skin. Surprisingly, it doesnt make foundation pill, so that gets a star. I will not repurchase. * I didnt get a sunburn but it is very hard to rub in so you need to apply alot of product. * I used the old version for years and it was nearly perfect; hydrating, easily spread, and non irritating. The new version takes a lot of work to spread in, leaves a white cast on my skin(nc45), clings to hairs, and isn't hydrating enough. * I've tried a few sport sunscreens and this is one of my favorites. I wear it everyday before my workouts to protect my skin outdoors and indoors from harmful UVA/UVB rays. I sweat a lot and it doesn't burn or sting my eyes which is a plus. One of the cons I have to note for others is, it is a little bit thick and greasy like a lot of sunscreens, but that doesn't really bother me personally. * Leaves you with a white cast after trying to rub it in."

BUY ANOTHER SUNSCREEN!!! * Super greasy and leaves a really bad white cast! * I don't why so many people hate this.  It is my holy grail mineral sunscreen.  It works and doesn't flare my rosecea or excema.

1) It is fragrance free.  It doesn't smell at all. I am picky - -and I noticed no smell. 

2) Mineral high spf — no irritating chemicals

3) oil free and noncomodogenic

4) it works

5) gluten free - I am celiac and get a rash and excema from topical or oral gluten

5) it doesn't make my skin burn or itch like all of the chemical sunscreens

6) yes, it leaves a whitish cast on my light olive skin.  So, after applying, after a few minutes, I brush on a light bit of MAC Studio Fix in my usual NC20.  Yes, I am a bit shiny, but I have oily skin and am shiny 24/7 regardless

So, this is my holy grail sunscreen.  Yay!  I have to wear it because I have developed hyperpigmentation and have to use trentinion at night and The Ordinary Niacinamide everyday. * Not brown skin friendly.

Ulta was out of my usual brand and I purchased this instead because it was just about all that was left.

It did not leave a white cast. * Estoy feliz de averiguar encontrado ente producto soy alérgica al sol y necesitaba encontrar un protector físico estaba desesperada por mi alergia micara y cuello y brazos llenos de ronchas no sabía la diferencia entre físico y químico cada año iba a emergencias por los granos odio tomar medicamentos ahora estoy con mi bolsa vacía pero sin granos gracias dermalogica * This suncreen is….def something makes me feel rlly greasy take forever to blend if you want a fast absorbing sunscreen this one is NOT for you it literally takes a whole day for it to feel somewhat not greasy on your face, dont get me wrong i have sensitive skin and i like how it didnt break me out BUTTTT  THE WHITECAST IS INSANE, im the whitest dominican there is to exist and it got me over looking purple😵‍💫 theres so many better options for cheaper😭 atp im just using it to cope with the fact that i spent that much money on it, your better off buying the la roche posay sunscreen * Gifted by Dermalogica. This product was nice. It was a little sample size but it did the trick. Felt nice going on my skin and very smooth. Might have to get the larger size of this next time for summer * My favorite brand!

I am never without their SPF for it offers great coverage without making my skin oily and definitely without causing breakouts. 

Perfect to apply after my moisturizer & before applying  my make up.

I highly recommend it!

I was looking forward to trying the coral shade the most. Just wish the set was actually the colors advertised! I think the formula is decent, but a little overpriced. * I really like thses.  They smell so good, like mint.
Wish they were available in store. * First off I'd like to say that this is the first time I've tried a tinted SPF lip balm! And I really like what I've tried so far! I've tried these for about 10 days and I really like how they feel on my lips. They are very moisturizing, silk texture and made in such pretty colors! My favorite is the Firecracker color. I like how nicely it glides on and doesn't feel cakey nor weighed down. I love the fact that these has SPF and I don't have to worry when I'm swimming at the pool if I get dried out lips. Also love the fact that this is organic, Vegan, and made with natural ingredient's and safe for the earth. Such high quality products and I'd love to test out other lip balm colors and also try other COOLA products! Perfect for the beach! * First off, I've only been using these for about 5 days and I'm absolutely OBSESSED. I love that it comes in 3 different shades and flavors but mainly the variety!

One of the first things I noticed about the lip sunscreen is how well it works, some products it takes a few days of using it for the effects to really work but this worked immediately, usually my lips crack and dry out depending how long I'm outside but this actually hydrated and protected them from cracking or drying out. One of the other things I loved was the fact you can barely even tell your wearing it! It doesn't feel weird or oily or cakey! And the other thing I loved was the fact it came with 3 different flavors! I highly recommend this product for anyone wanting the perfect go to lip sunscreen!!

This review was collected as part of a promotion. * This lippie trio is a must-have in your vacation bag! To say I'm obsessed is an understatement. I have fair skin and I try to avoid sun exposure as much as possible. (I promise I'm not a vampire.) That being said, I love it when my makeup doubles as my extra sun protection! I was so excited to try these tinted lip balms out, and I am so glad I did! The color payoff for these lip balms is pretty amazing. You can build up the coverage or sheer them out. They all have a different scent to each color, and each one smells great. I did also experiment with using the lip balms as a blush and I was extremely pleased with the results. My favorite shade out of the pack has to be 'Summer Crush' due to its vibrant color. If you're a lip balm girlie, you are going to need these if you are out in the sun. This review was collected as part of a promotion * The coolas travel mineral lip trio was just perfection! Every color was beautiful and the packaging was spot on! These lippies provide spf 30, is definitely 40 mins water resistant and glides on like a charm! I went away for the weekend and the hotel I was staying at had a pool where I decided to put them through the  water resistant test. Let me tell you it did not rub off at all! Every lippie has a different name and beautiful crafted smell that definitely goes with the name. The packaging said to apply 15 mins before sun exposure which I did and It held through the whole day with a second reapplication because the sun was really harsh that day. I also forgot to bring blush and I used the firecrackers lippie on my cheeks and it gave me a natural beachy cheeky glow. Blended in my cheeks so seemingly. I love what the brands stands for and how the ingredients are great! * COOLA's Organic Lip Sunscreen with a 30 SPF comes in 3 different shade and flavors. These are organic and vegan. I like that It shields my lips from both UVA and UVB rays, preventing sunburn. I spend most of my free time gardening and these have been a life saver for my lips. I love how compact the tube is which makes it easier to carry around in my small crossbody bag. These glide easily and not chalky at all compared to other products I've used. I really like that these provide a subtle amount of tint, it's more of a natural tint. These are perfect for when you want to add a subtle amount of color without having to go all out. Each color is different and perfect for when I want to change it up. I was surprised with the scent and flavor, it's not overpowering. Firecracker is actually my go to right now. My one complaint is that I wished these were more moisturizing. These are perfect for summer! I can't wait to take these to the beach with me. I recommend 100%"

The scent is horrible and smells old even though it isn't expired. It will ruin your day is you put it on before heading out to the beach/pool because the smell is so awful * The texture is really nice, but the smell is off. Has a stale smell * Coola's sunscreen lotion went on easy and without a greasy, oily film. It lasted well throughout the day, and smelled great! * Put this on before going to the beach and then reapplied, still ended up a lobster. Not a fan unfortunately :( * This product gets the job done. Feels smooth on skin without feeling greasy. I also appreciate the business model of Coola. Scent is not fresh and tropical like piña colada infers. I'll use this again but maybe buy a different scent next time * Like the facial sunscreen  this went on so smoothly, and dried down quickly with no sticky or greasy residue. I haven't experienced any pilling. Smells great, but not too strong. Great sunscreen! * Product was expired and smelled horrible. Will not buy again."

I have UBER SENSITIVE SKIN that can be prone to breakouts with the majority of products.  This is everything it says and more!  Weightless, blends beautifully and my skin doesn't freak whatsoever!  Great product line! * I love this weightless sunscreen.  It's light and does not have the traditional sunscreen smell.  Blends very well with make up. * omg i have been looking for a mineral sunscreen that doesnt leave me looking like a ghost (with a whitecast) forEVER!!! This is my favorite thing in the world. I use this by itself on no makeup days but it works extremely well with all of my different foundations on top!! Pls never discontinue this💕💕 * I love the way this product feels and how it looks on my skin. It doesnt pill or dry out my already dry skin. However, I won't buy again because it burns if i put it anywhere near my eyes. Also washing my face with it on is a nightmare because its impossible to keep it completely away from my eyes. So, if your eyes/skin are sensitive i would stay away. * I love this sunscreen. It doesn't make me oily, break out, or flare my eczema. I can easily apply the necessary amount of sunscreen without feeling like my skin is suffocating. The formula is very thin and almost feels like a serum. It absorbs within a few minutes. This sunscreen doesn't have silicones, so it will pill if worn on top of products with silicones. I've worn it with a moisturizer containing silicones and it pilled badly. I currently wear it with a silicone free moisturizer and it does not pill whatsoever. It has a beautiful tint and gives a nice, no makeup look. My skin isn't smooth at all and this sunscreen helps me feel a little bit more confident. * I love how easy it goes on my combination skin. The color blended well with my olive pink-toned skin.  I do have to keep on searching though, because it's too greasy for me. I couldn't wait to wash it off.  Not sure if all the facial sunscreens say you have to reapply at least every two hours but i know i can't be doing that. * this was such a disappointing sunscreen. I bought this bc there were so many people on tiktok claiming it was a great product but i immediately hated it when i put it on. gave this a couple tries but each time the sunscreen smell was so strong and the sunscreen starts to pill and come off so easily. this also wears terribly under makeup - as soon as you try to put concealer over it, it pills. complete waste of money."

I've been on the hunt for a sunscreen that doesn't exacerbate any one of these issues. I don't use mineral sunscreens because they don't agree with my dry skin. This sunscreen is almost perfect. It doesn't burn my skin, it doesn't cause any skin flushing, it's hydrating, it doesn't pill, it doesn't break me out. Unfortunately it caused my eyes to sting horribly throughout the day. I really loved this sunscreen at first, and I was so disappointed. I'll continue to use it as a body sunscreen though."

I am a medium skinned black woman and there is no white caste, even after working out for an hour! Also, it is so comfortable, it does not feel like you are wearing anything AND it is very moisturizing.  I could not stop touching my face. 
This version is better than the non sweatproof version and the best mineral sunscreen I have ever tried, and I have tried a lot. * This is perfect for your outdoor activities--high SPF , water/sweat resistant with very minimal white cast for a zinc-only sunscreen at that high SPF (give it a little time for the slight white to dissipate-note however that i am fairly pale). I also use this on my neck and chest for everyday wear because it doesnt get ""orange"" tint on my collars and 
clothing like my everyday tinted spf does. It feels moisturizing in the skin. It is very different from kinships spf 30 product although I Highly recommend you try both!! * first one suits my sensitive skin, no more irritation and watery eyes due to sunscreen * I love the other Kinship SPF so I thought I'd give this one a try since it's ""water resistant"" and SPF60. I don't see HOW this is water resistant because it never sets and its continuously greasy, on top of that my skin STILL managed to dry out two hours after I've applied it. It rubs off into everything and if you touch your face at any point in the day (I've worn it for 6+ hours) it moves and gets into everything. I've almost finished the whole tube thinking maybe it's user error... it could still possibly be the case. I'm 30 with rosacea, combination dry skin with hormonal breaks out and a thyroid condition that tends to dry my skin and hair out.. I wanted to like this sunscreen but it's a big no. I can't make it work, I've tried it alone, with moisturizer, under makeup, with serum only. I don't feel protected when I wear this sunscreen. It's also got this iridescence to it that at first I thought I would like but it just makes you look like *shiny* vampire. * After using the kinship self reflect spf 30 for several months, this sunscreen is definately my preference over the self reflect. This sunscreen has a very natural satin finish and is very hyrdating without being greasy, while the self reflect spf 30 has a dewy finish and is more lightweight. It takes about 5 minute after application for it to absorb and the cast to disappear. The long term benefits for my very sensitive combo skin have been amazing. The keratosis bumps on my cheeks have completely disappeared and this is the only product I have change in my routine. It has a very subtle vanilla scent that disapears shortly after application. Also the cast is hardly noticable on pale-medium skin. My friend with dark skin borrowed some and said that even though there was a slight white cast for her, it was surprisingly subtle given how high spf it is. This sunscreen has replaced my foundation at this point because  texture of my skin has improved so much since using it. I wish kinship made a body sunscreen like this. Kinship is a solid clean skincare brand and most of my products are from kinship since they are only of the few brands that cause irritation for me. If you have sensitive combo skin I would especially recommend this brand. * After using the kinship self reflect spf 30 for several months, this sunscreen is definately my preference over the self reflect.

Its like pure oil that never drys which also means that, while sweat and water resistant, any product on your forehead will run and burn your eyes. The white cast isnt horrible but its so hard to actually rub it in without piling so that doesnt even matter."

There was still anton of product left! * It works very well under my makeup and makes my skin look younger. I will definitely buy this product again. * Really nice ,smooth sunscreen. Blends well with my skin with no white cast. * I really like this. It helps my make up go on easier. * I like that the finish blurs the skin & that it's SPF 45. It doesn't leave a white cast on me it's free of oxybenzone & octinoxate which can be harmful to sea life so I suppose you can wear it to swim/dive, if you're into that.

Personally I'm not a fan of the texture. It's soft and satiny which I find makes it hard to spread, so I deducted a star. It's not as ""wet"" as the Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen- it's more like an ointment

Can't comment on pilling as I always do a pre-check with whatever I'm wearing under my sunscreen to make sure they'll play nice together. 

Also haven't worn it under makeup yet but it my skin looks similar to when I wear my smashboxx blurring primer so my guess it'll be good as a Primer too * It goes on clear so no white cast which is nice. But it is kind of thick and heavy. It takes a little while to actually settle on the skin. I would probably switch back to the super goop unseen instead."

However, it peels off instantly and don't even think to wear it under makeup. Plus, it leaves a white cast every time I apply it. I'm pale white. This is a big regret for me. * If you have olive undertones or tan skin in general this is not for you. The white cast is horrible and this sunscreen does not blend well at all.

I have been using for over a year now and it is the only moisturizer that can keep my skin hydrated in the winter (and I tried many products!) Nongreasy, clean ingredients too. Safe to use while pregnant, and smells great. My go to moisturizer.  I even use it during the day in the winter under my makeup. Don't need it during the summer during the day, but still use nightly! * I wanted to like this since I love their Vitamin C serum. My skin is kinda dry and has some imperfections that the additional Vitamin C would have helped. But, my husband can't tolerate the smell. The smell is bearable to me, but he stays away till the smell fades. After using it every night for about 2 weeks, my skin feels like it's lacking moisture. That's the only thing in my regular routine that I changed. I may try adding a face oil and try and finish using it to see if it smooths out my imperfections and report back. * If you have oily skin, this probably won't work well for you, but it has done wonders for my dry skin. Absorbs pretty quickly and is not heavy on the skin. * I use this every night after I wash my face. It's hydrating and smells great * I like the Mad Hippie skincare line, rates very high on Yuka because it's all natural ingredients. However, there is a strong smell to it… not sure if its the vitamin C smell or if it's something else in there… to me it smells metallic and it takes me out. I really think a little goes a long way for this product. I did not know it clogs pores, I did not have that issue so far and I have lots of blackheads. Maybe I haven't used it enough. It is also very pricy… I think I'm going to use the regular face cream from now on since it smells nicer and absorbs better. If you want to have the vitamin C factor, I recommend the vitamin C toning mist and the vitamin C serum. They smell amazing and work great. I think I'll be returning this one. * I used to love this night cream! Mad Hippie is my go to brand for everything! It has cleans ingredients and will not make me break out! 
But they changed everything, the new versions/recipe of this cream stinks so bad i couldnt even put it on my face and almost threw up. It makes me sad because now i have to find another night cream. 

The older version was amazing! Absorbed perfectly and hydrated my face within minutes.

I wish they wouldn't of changed it * I have been using this for quite a while and I loved the way it smells and feels until they changed the formula. It is thicker and has an odd smell, I like fragrance and I understand some people are sensitive but they should offer two options then. It smells odd and whatever is in it is now very noticeable in the smell with the pleasant smell it had before."

I have a skin allergy and was pretty disappointed when this arrived and the box listed 4x as many ingredients as the website. * I have dry skin & I initially enjoyed this sunscreen. At first it was hydrating without excess oils & silicones but hours later my skin would feel dry again, maybe due to the Hyaluronic Acid in this. The twist bottle also opens on its own and spilled all over my drawer. * I have stuffled looking for an amazing sunscreen that goes well with extremely sensitive skin and dry skin and is SPF50. I experience no stinging, tingly, burning, or redness on my face. The price is definitely worth purchasing and rebuying. Happy to say I have found my go to product. * Why aren't more people talking about this sunscreen? It is amazing. Very light sunscreen scent dissipates quickly. It leaves my skin lightly hydrated, glowy and I use it all over. I am in my third bottle. I am VERY picky about sun protection and this is phenomenal. * This product claims to be a multitasker but it didn't sit well under my makeup and burned my eyes when I perspired. For the price point I expected more. With what's available now leaving no whitecast isn't as valuable as it used to be. Check out anthelios if you don't have $40 to spend on mid products."

Not many products, including sunscreen, break me out, but the ones that do, REALLY mess me up. This sunscreen broke me out terribly. Not all over the face, but a few cystic blemishes, including one of my nose. I'm still dealing with the scarring from that :( The scent on this is VERY strong. I am not sensitive to scents at all. I don't care when products are scented, but there is no need for it be this strongly scented. What were they thinking? 

I bought this during the beauty days sale so I will keep it and use it on my neck and chest for the anti-aging benefits, but if you are breakout prone from sunscreens, be very careful with this one. * My first time trying out this face sunscreen and it feels nothing like all the others I've tried and used under makeup! This is veil like, smooth application…. BUT!!! The scent! The scent is STRONG and it does not go away even after you applying foundation or bb cream… I really wanted to love this product because of the peptides but im disappointed I will not be using it as I wanted due to the smell. Side note the description does indicate there is a floral scent to it (i missed reading that part) I agree it is a floral scent except it is strong! * I like how this goes on and the potential benefits, however, it irritates my rosacea and makes me redder. * When I first used it, I loved the cosmetic elegance and how it feels on my skin. Yes, like what everyone was saying, the fragrance is so strong. I typically do not have any reaction to any active ingredients. I use VC, VA, anything with no problem. I had my first allergic reaction three weeks ago. I was red, a bit swollen, very itchy from face to neck. I thought other new products I just opened and used caused it, and at that time i was using other sunscreen for sensitive skin. Two weeks ago I started using this again on a day I ate a lot of seafood, so I thought it was the seafood gave me the same reaction. Now I was totally healed and used this sunscreen for the third times, and again my entire face look like monster. I wonder what exact ingredient gave me allergy. * Would have been okay, the scent is strong, but this stung my eyes after about an hour. * This is a great product, but they kind of ruined it with a SUPER strong fragrance. I don't dislike the fragrance itself, it actually smells okay (to me it smells like those scentsicles you put in your artificial  christmas tree to make it smell real), but it is SO super strong, it's all I can smell all day. Like, even over the actual perfume I put on, this smells stronger. So I'm docking a star for that. Otherwise, it is matte, non-greasy (and I have extremely oily skin), doesn't make me get super greasy over the course of the day, and moisturizes well enough that I don't need a separate moisturizer or even eye cream underneath. I haven't noticed any anti-aging effects yet but I've only been using it for a few weeks. It's kind of expensive, but not outrageously so. I like the formula so I'm going to use up the tube, but because of the fragrance I probably won't repurchase unless I get used to it enough that it stops bothering me. * I've been in the beauty industry for over 12 years so tried A LOT of products including sunscreen. This one from Vichy was really at the top. 

I live in Texas and try to use sunscreen everyday. The product is non-sticky, absorbs quickly with no white film. It also has a very appealing, skincare smell. My makeup went over the sunscreen very easily.  

While the number one reason I use sunscreen is for the SPF protection all the extra goodies, like Vitamin C, really made me feel good about using it on my skin

The packaging is really sleek but more importantly the dispenser is great. Nice amount and very smooth. Sunscreen tubes can get really messy, and this one does not. 

This one is a keeper! Full disclosure I got this product through Stellar Product Testing Panel but fully stand by my review."

Minimal white cast at least but still not my fave. * I personally am not a fan of how this product looks on my skin and how it feels. I've been using it daily for the past month or so since I got it to really give this product a shot but it's not it. I dont understand the ""glow"" everyone else is talking about but on my skin freshly after washing and everything it is extremely greasy and stays like that all day. I will give it credit for not leaving much of a white cast, easily blending into the skin, and looking nice under makeup but the thick greasy feeling I can't get over. My skin is on the dryer side if that means anything to anyone. Also if I go out on a really nice sunny day right after applying my face still burns!?!?!?! so not very sheilding. For me it is not worth the money or time. * I am on probably my fourth or fifth bottle of this. I have very dry skin so some might find it a little too dewy looking but I love it. No white cast. Looks great under makeup. And I've never gotten sunburned. I can't imagine wanting to try anything else. * This was recommended to me by of the Utla Associates and she said, once I started using it I wouldn't go back to the one I was originally looking for and she was right. * Light weight,  dries smooth and no white finish on skin."

I shake it until the cows come home
I use just ONE moisturizer underneath it
I put it on NAKED skin

It PILLS, without fail * this is my new foundation. 2 in 1 for sure. I am going for a second bottle. * I've used heavy full coverage foundations for almost 20 years. I wanted to add sunscreen and skincare to my makeup. tried several tinted serums, sunscreens, moisturizers, but this one actually has some coverage and gives you a glow. I stopped wearing foundation completely now. this is my daily go to. if I need extra coverage I use a little concealer. I still do my smoky eye and it looks great * Product is definitely oily and even after shaking VERY well, it was still separating and had almost sandlike grains in it. Additionally it was not blendable at all and made my lightly tanned skin look ghostly. Am returning asap. * Love this product!  Fantastic protection and a light moisturizing coverage.  This product does it all. * I am a repeat buyer! I am fair complected and the tint really works for my skin tone. That said, it's not the best ever and ever. I do feel that it doesn't fully dry down and I wish it had more filters than just titanium dioxide. I keep using it! But am forever on the hunt for a different one as well * I have tried soooo many mineral sunscreens, and they have all been disappointments in one or more ways: thick as glue, wierd unpleasant smell, settles into expression lines and wrinkles, globs onto fine facial hair or hairline, balls up when applied over other products, tinted products too dark and orangey tan… BUT this one is absolutely perfect, a joy to use as it has none of those drawbacks, none!  The weight and consistency is very light, like applying a serum; yet it offers enough coverage to even out tone.  I only have to apply a tiny bit of concealer here and there, to feel polished and glowy. I never spend prolonged time out in direct sun without a big hat, but the Spf seems to be really good (I use 8 drops to cover my face). I had a problem with the nozzle and cap getting messy with oozing overflowing sunscreen everytime I shook the bottle, but taking off the cap and firmly covering the nozzle tip with my finger while shaking solves that issue."

I love FAB products but this is NOT it. * Very heavy sunscreen. Does not blend well and leaves white cast. Will not be purchasing again. * At this price point I expected better. It's very difficult to rub in if you're using the correct amount. I'm using it up on my arms, but it's still annoying to apply. * I have rosacea and my skin is extremely sensitive. This sunscreen calms my skin down and keeps it protected. The combination of the zinc and oat are perfect. I love this so much! It's very hard to find a sunscreen without niacinamide and butyloctyl salicylate and I am so glad I found one! * Had worse, but offers a bit of a white cast and like others have said is a bit streaky and drying

It feels really great on the skin and does not clog my pores. * It is second time to me to use it because I love it and it's perfect on my skin!! * when it comes to sunblock I want to cringe at the price but it works SO WELL and my skin doesn't break out AT ALL when using this.
I know I'll be rebuying it once I run out. * Again - poorly packaged; leaked all over the very small bottle.  Over priced for the amount. * Don't like this product. If u sweat it will burn and irritate your eyes. * I have several Kiehl's products, I am in love with this brand and have the best skin I've had in a long time. Some things I deal w/ are being acne-prone, oily, rosacea and very sensitive. I've been doing some research on rosacea and have read that wearing a daily SPF can help with redness (among many other benefits, of course). I wanted to make sure I was getting a product from a brand I believe in because face sunscreen has been tricky for me. It's usually greasy and breaks me out significantly. I spent the extra money for this product and am unfortunately not very pleased. Like other comments, this product does ball up on the face. I find that I have to let my daily moisturizer sink in for AT LEAST 10 minutes before I can put on my sunscreen. And the more you try to massage it into the face, the more it will ball up. Other than that, my MAJOR complaint about this product is that after applying and about an hour after it's on my face, my skin starts to burn. It feels as though I have a mild sunburn across my entire face where you can feel the discomfort and burn. Again, I have sensitive skin and apparently it's just not reacting well with me. I've gone a few days without it and then tried it again and it is 100% this sunscreen. I'm out side of my return time so I'm stuck with it and really disappointed. I hate having to purchase products to figure out what works for my skin. Just writing this in-depth review for those of you with the same kind of skin as me...just to think twice. I will say, it does eventually sink into my skin and does not leave it greasy so that's a positive. * Since it is new to me, I am still trying to learn the right amount to apply. Too much (first try) and I had to blot it to make it just right. Second day, it was fine. It does not leave a white cast, definitely a pro. For its high quality, the price is reasonable!"

PROS: 
- whipped texture 
- neutral tones 
- matte finish 
- absorbs oil
- good around the eye area 
- great for oily skin and/or summer
- 50+ SPF
- great for an active lifestyle

CONS: 
- feels a little heavy until it sets 

I do two layers of sunscreen: first a chemical sunscreen and then a mineral sunscreen. This is the best mineral sunscreen I've tried (Neutrogena, Cerave, MDSolarSciences, DMTLGY). * It's REALLY good, just not for someone with dry skin. I do like the texture, coverage, natural looking color, and the overall matte apperance but after 30 minutes it dries me out so bad. It would be good for humid days/someone with ""normal"" skin. * Over all good but very prone to rub off on clothing. Can't use near v neck and don't pull a top over your head. * The title says it all.  I purchased this, very excited to have found a sunscreen that is spf 50 and tinted AND acne safe.  Read some reviews saying it was not good at all, etc, great for oily skin.  This is why I was happily surpised that on my fair, dry skin it felt and looked great.  It was a little bit dark for my skin but it just made me look bronzed there wasn't any harshness or orange.  And it felt good on my skin under makeup (concealer and powder) all day.  Very suprised it also did not transfer.  Overall great product but I am suspicious of how it is spf 50 when the active ingredients do not indicate this at all. * Favorite daily sunscreen! It's been so hard for me to find one that doesn't irritate my skin! Plus, it's cruelty free, and reef friendly while not being too expensive for the large amount in one tube. It's an amazing product! * This is literally impossible to wash off! In the shower I washed my face FIVE times and I'm still seeing remnants of orange looking clay-like product on my face. I wouldnt reccomend to anyone unless you're into permanent makeup that dries orange and cakey. * This product is only 4% zinc oxide! There is NO WAY this can offer any protection. I thought it looked nice on my face and recommended it to a friend, then we both burned the first day the sun came out. Should have looked at the actual percentage of the active ingredients; the FDA recommends 10%- 20% zinc oxide in sunscreen. This won't protect you!"

Feels super heavy and oily on my dry skin and it peels when appliyng makeup. * It is now 2024 and we still have physical sunscreens that give darker skin women a white cast. The 12 dollar Neutrogena sunscreen will give you the same results. Save your money. * Another physical sunscreen that pictures black women but then isn't inclusive. It still gives whitecast on brown skin. Disappointed. * For me personally I found it to be watery and made my face look pasty white. Just like the kind you would get from normal skinscreen. Granted it does smell good and does the job of protecting my skin. * This spf is so lightweight and easy to wear under makeup. I have very oily skin and for a change a spf lotion didn't make it worse. I can't recommend this enough * The actual sunscreen is great but unusable because of the pump. Have to take off lid and try to fish out little globs of it to actually use. Too bad. How could their quality dept approve this packaging?! * I really like the product itself. Unfortunately it's a little too thick for the pump to dispense it. I have to take the lid off and use the pump stick to swipe it on my hands. Also, ran out after just a couple of weeks of use. Perhaps I got a bottle that had been returned and the previous person used a lot of the product?"

Rubs in easy while protecting your skin. * I'm very disappointed, this is definitely Not Avene. The smell is ghastly and the texture is very dense much more the original Avene . * Smells awful but wears nicely with no white cast on fairer skin, however for deeper skin it would likely be unsuitable. You get a great amount for the price compared to equivalents from Supergoop, LRP, RoC, and others. * I can't believe this is an Avène product.  All their products are usually light, fresh, airy, & pleasant.  THIS ONE SMELLS TERRIBLE.  I CAN't stand it.  Smells old, musty, almost stale like & chemically.  Runny consistency.  I'm so DISAPPOINTED. I looked up reviews and I see I'm not the only one. (Thought maybe I got a bad bottle). Not sure what happened with this one. * Unlike most mineral sunscreens, this doesn't leave a white cast and isn't drying. However, it's pretty greasy even for my dry skin. I have to powder it down. * I got this because the picture looked somewhat clear and sounded safe for skin. This is terrible. Its thick white and leaves a nasty white coating on skin and smells/feels terrible. Its waxy and horrible. * I got this sunscreen in a gift with purchase and tried it immediately. I was excited because usually (unfortunately) many chemical sunscreens break me out and this didnt have anything but zinc oxide. It was a little heavy and took a little longer to blend out than others ive used but after blending it was definitely a dewy sunscreen. It wore well under my minimal makeup but was a little more dewy than i usually like."

If you're super pale and in the market for a tinted moisturizer or sunscreen, I cannot recommend this enough! * I'm actually a fan of other Bliss products, but I have never experienced a whiter cast from sunscreen in my life. I could tell it would have one as it came out of the bottle, but wanted to trust the ""sheer"" claims. Will be returning. * I really like the light weight feel of this sunscreen, espeically for a mineral one. Although I find it pills under makeup and can cling to dry spots. So best for a no makeup day. * Iv tried a lot of sunscreens and I mean alot . Every single sunscreen I have used breaks me out even mineral ones. This sunscreen is by far the best one iv ever used its just amazing . * This sunscreen is so good. I've tried so many sunscreens and this one has everything I want. It actually absorbs, no white cast, it doesn't get into my eyes, and it's recyclable. * I need to stick to mineral sunscreens for my skin, so it's been hard for me to find one that leaves a minimal white cast, has high SPF, and is water-resistant. I just finished my first bottle of this, and so far I think it's one of the better ones I've tried! It doesn't irritate my skin, blends impressively for SPF 50, and doesn't feel heavy at all.

I have tan skin, so I usually wear a BB cream over this to cancel out the slight white cast this leaves. Note that it's a high SPF, untinted *mineral* sunscteen, so I cannot expect it to be fully clear. 

The one downside is that this seems to turn white in areas that get wet or have a lot of friction, such as under the bridge of your glasses. It can be rubbed back in very easily, but that's something to note. * I love the other bliss sunscreen but I wanted to try this one since it's SPF 50. This sunscreen left the worst white cast on my skin no matter how long I rubbed it in."
218,218,218,218,mad hippie,luminizing facial spf 29,pimprod2030862,2592480," * eceived this product for free it was a gifted from MadHippie. It was a nice sunscreen! I wore it at the beach and it lasted a while and I did not get burnt. I would recommend this product it was very nice. 
Complimentary from madhippie * Pros
1) no white cast
2) does not melt into eyes like Neutrogena sunscreen and cause eye pain/tears
Cons
1) product separates. It's like ketchup where sometimes just the liquid comes out of the tube. There is no indication on the tube that the product must be shaken, so I assume that this is just poor formulation. 
2) sunscreen remains sticky to touch, even after an hour (ambient temp was 75degr, humidity was 40%, so it's not because of the weather!)
3) the sunscreen rubs off and leaves white marks on my black athletic shorts, even after an hour

For this low amount of SPF at this price point, I expect a better product. I have not tried to apply makeup over this product, but I don't even want to try based on how this sunscreen performs on a bare face. 
Thankfully, I received this product as a gift. * I have never tried anything from Mad Hippie but I was so excited to try this beautiful product.  I try to protect my skin at all cost because it's very important to me so I always apply sunscreen on face . I always read the description to make sure it has the best ingredients possible this sunscreen is amazing my face looks so glowy , hydrated and healthy looking. I also think the formula is very Nicky done and it blends in easily. Love that it's vegan has clean ingredients and crueltyfree and the packaging is so cute. I love using it and would highly recommend it. gifted by madhippie * I absolutely love this sunscreen! It blends perfectly and the formula is so smooth. It glides onto the skin effortlessly and it does not leave a white cast which is perfect for us ladies of deeper skin tones! I love this product and I recommend it to everyone! * I love this brand, and have been using the SPF serum as my daily SPF for a couple years now. My store hasn't been stocking it lately, and I was totally out, so I tried this. No matter how long I let it settle into the skin, it pills the second I apply any makeup over the top of it. * I've been using this all summer into winter now and I cannot go without it.  It puts the perfect sparkle on my face and my skin looks so good since wearing it all summer now. I won't go a day without it. * I love the brand and was excited to try this sample.

It pilled and left weird white bits in my hair line.

The product also has actual glitter/shinmer, which I'm not opposed to BUT its not fine enough. It doesnt look like a sheer glitter, so it looks unnatural. If you want the edward twilight look, GET IT!

Otherwise, ill stick to La Roche Posay SPF"

It gives such a dewy glowy feel to my skin and also makes my skin feel much more hydrated. I love how lightweight the product actuallh feels on the body and skin. Overall im really really happy with this product * I was so excited to try this product out! I love hempz products, there lotions have been a staple for me, but when it came to this sunscreen I didn't really love it. The smell is amazing it's sweet and tropical it's a perfect sent for a sunscreen, but the sunscreen and texture itself I didn't love. I also didn't love a lot of the ingredients in this product it it's not very clean and that was the first thing that really started me away from it. Over all I'd rate it a 2/5. If the ingredients were better it would be a good product. * This sunscreen has the most amazing scent i have ever smelled. I love how the aroma of the fragrance lasts alk day and gives your body a nice dewy glow and keeps your skin hydrated. The packaging is also really cute too. This is the perfect summer product ever * Living in the Wonderful State of Texas, I cannot go out of  my house without sunscreen. I've tried many sunscreens over the years, but the Hemp Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon Herbal Body Sunscreen SPF 50 stands out as a true gem. 
First and foremost, the SPF 50 protection is top-notch. I feel confident that my skin is shielded from harmful UV rays every time I apply it. Whether I'm spending a day at the pool or just running errands, I know my skin is well-protected.
One of the biggest issues I've had with other sunscreens is the heavy, greasy feeling they leave behind. Not this one! The Hemp Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon Herbal Body Sunscreen is incredibly lightweight and absorbs quickly. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without any sticky residue.
 The scent is absolutely divine. The combination of sweet pineapple and honey melon is refreshing and uplifting, making application a pleasant experience. It's like a tropical vacation in a bottle!
I love that this sunscreen is formulated with hemp and other herbal ingredients. It feels nourishing and hydrating on my skin, which is a bonus on top of the excellent sun protection. My skin feels moisturized and healthy after every use. * I have been a fan of hempz for years. They always have good quality products and there hasn't been too many products that I've tried and didn't like. I've always loved their lotion so I was excited about them coming out with an SPF. I love it! It smells so fruity and sweet so if you're someone that likes fragrant smells you'll love this. The problem I have with most sunscreens is how greasy and oily it gets but I didn't have that problem with this one at all. I would recommend. * Hello, my name is InasA And I have combination skin I have been using this moisturizer with SPF 50 for week or so I found that the product leaves my skin for days very hydrated plus protected at the same time . I live in Tennessee the weather here is very hot and humid is high so the protection must during the summertime. It's a smell like a bunch of fruit for the pleasant smell. * I recently tried the HEMPZ Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon Herbal Body Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF 50, and I am thoroughly impressed. The sunscreen has a delightful, tropical scent that makes application enjoyable. It provides excellent sun protection while keeping my skin hydrated and smooth. The non-greasy formula absorbs quickly, making it perfect for daily use. I appreciate that it combines the benefits of a moisturizer with high SPF protection. Highly recommended for anyone looking for effective sun care with a pleasant fragrance."

But the chemical scent is so strong, If even put the product up to my face, my eyes sting and water. It also pills into little balls when your rub it in. I havne't gotten burned when I wear it so it does protect my skin- & I'm finishing the bottle because I don't want to waste it. But I would not buy it again. * Feels and smells like a sanitizer.

I really was hoping this would be a great, sheer, water resistant, mineral option for the summer.  However, if you use more than a smidge, this pills.  I tried on bare skin, over just a toner, under my full normal morning skin routine and it pills on application.  The texture is nice and not drying, and the cast is minimal, but present,  in comparison to many other mineral sunscreens.  I am aggressively neutral on the smell, its a little sunscreen-y, but it doesnt bother me.. Its neither strong, nor long lasting.  Also, its not a great amount.  I plan to use this up on my hands and ears. * I have mixed feelings about this sunscreen. One the one hand it dries down quickly and isnt sticky which I really appreicate. On the other hand it pills around my chin, neck, and eyebrows…which isnt the worst thing but is a little annoying. I mostly use this sunscreen on days where I need to run out of the house and need something that dries down quickly. * I love this sunscreen! As the name suggests it is very sheer and leaves my skin feeling moisturized without feeling sticky or greasy (a big ask for my oily skin). I will say, it does pill up under makeup if you start immediately after applying, but I give it 10 minutes or so and you should have no problem! * I used to use Biossance squalane mineral sunscreen until people started having reactions and it was pulled off the market. In my search for a comparable sunscreen, I found this one and honestly I think I like it even more! Feels very lightweight and moisturizing and blends in well! I like the glow it gives but I don't think it makes me look oily (I have combo-dry skin).My only wish is if they could make an SPF 50+ version! * I've been trying to convince myself that I really like this sunscreen for the last few weeks and I just don't think this is the product for me. Pills frequently regardless of what products I use underneath it, especially around the edge of my face. Won't end up finishing the bottle. * Only postives it has a nice gel texture and does not leave a not white cast. The smell reminds me of glue. It also pills a lot. * Upon arrival the product seem to be so extremely small for the price that I paid, it also looked like it had little to no product inside. Such a waste of money!!

I replaced my foundation and now use this for the summer. It makes my face look so healthy and gives it a nice glow. No sun burns either! * One of the worst tinted sunscreen I've tried. Tossed it after using it twice. It would matt down and stayed on looking greasy, not luminating but greasy looking! * I completely missed that this is tinted. I wish it said so on the front of the packaging. The tint looks horrible on me, which I would've known already. Otherwise, it's greasy and heavy. * Not a terrible product but not loving it for my fair skin. I'm the one usually buying the absolute lightest shade of foundation or skin products. I'm finding that the tint in this product looks pretty obvious on me and comes out a bit patchy. There will be spots or lines of color and overall just doesnt blend with my skin. It dries pretty quick so its hard to blend out well. Using moisturizer immediately before helps, but i feel like this waters down the product and probably limits its efficacy and sort of removes the color altogether. However, its probably a decent product for more medium tones. * Pills pretty bad and goes on tacky. Can only put on a bit at a time. 
Also feels very heavy on the face. Smells good though and looks pretty if you blend all pilling out! * I am a Pacifica product fan and have used several of their products for a few years and decided to try this one. It leaves a sticky, heavy and tacky feeling on the skin, oxidizes to a 1-2 shades darker as well. I have never used a tinted spf face lotion before and this is not one I'd recommend. It doesn't blend in it feels as though its sitting on the skin.  I tried it 4 times and I looked forward to washing my face off at night.

I tried multiple times, thinking the product just had to work its way up the pump but, when I opened it, the tube for the pump was so bent around and around that there was no way the product could have made its way up. Additionally, the product is SO thick that I'm not sure how it even could have fit through the tiny tubing. Instead of scooping it all out, I'm planning to return. * Left my face feeling kind of greasy, but the biggest issue is how jacked the bottle is. When I opened it, I couldn't get the pump to work, and removed it to see if I could get it working. The tube leading from the pump into the bottle was bent into a zig-zag, rendering the pump completely useless. Now I have to scoop it out and use the bent tube like a tiny spatula. The moisturizer itself isn't anything special. Not sure I would buy again, especially if they're not cautious during the packing process to make sure the pump will actually work."

Separates horribly, clumps on my lips and hairline, strong white cast. * I religiously used the original Ultra Calming moisturizer from Aveeno for over 20 years.  That moisturizer was perfect- amazing texture, good pump packaging, and most importantly it was 100% effective at keeping my redness at bay.
This stuff (which is essentially their replacement to that one) is  garbage.  It's tinted (why?), it has a sticky texture which makes it difficult to blend in, and the packaging is cheap.   On top of all that, it actually has made my redness worse.  Oh!  And it has HALF the amount of the product as the Ultra Calming moisturizer- for a higher price.   Corporate greed trickling down to the consumer does not go unnoticed.  Johnson & Johnson majorly dropped the ball with this new ""Calm and Restore"" line. * Aveeno used to make worlds most perfect face moisturizer. When it was discontinued I was distraught. I tried so many products but my skin breaks out to everything. I figured this is the closest thing they had to the moisturizer I loved so much. It's not. IT IS SO STICKY. It feels AWFUL on my face. I always wash my hands after using it. It doesn't spread well because it's so sticky. it feels like it isn't moisturizing at all. It's also tinted?? Why?? Why is it a tan color? It would probably be awful for any dark skin girlies. I'm super pale so it's too tan for me, and when I itch my face, a ton of orange pigment comes off onto my hands. God I'm so disappointed in Aveeno for discontinuing their last calm and restore product. This one is awful…. * This is a tinted product, which I personally am not a fan of. It also doesn't say anywhere on the bottle that it's tinted? And I find that it pills a lot, But I have very sensitive skin and it hasn't irritated me or broken me out so not bad overall"

It doesn't have a nasty smell and it's not too overbearing either! I noticed my skin felt way smoother after using as well. I love it and will for sure buy again. * This is my favorite sunscreen. I buy it over and over again. I'm very pale so I can't speak about white cast, but it's not a mineral sunscreen so that shouldn't be a huge problem. It is very hydrating but not oily. It feels like I've just put on a nice moisturizer. It also reapplies very well. It never pills on top of itself. I don't wear foundation so I don't know about wearing it under anything but it does look good under a skin tint or concealer. * Tried this out for a humid, 100 degree full sun TX vacation. It never stung my eyes! It leaves a shine, but is comfortable to wear and less greasy than any others I've tried. Effective, comfortable, I'm sold! * This is great to use in the morning before my run. I have normal/combination skin and I don't even need to wear a moisturizer under this. It gives me a glow, not over the top. Doesn't sting my eyes, even when I sweat.  I also love the oil-free version for everyday use. That version is perfect over moisturizer and will work best for those with oilier skin. Shiseidos newest sunscreens are a big improvement from their previous version, which I already used. * The only sunscreen that EVER worked for me. Doesn't make my skin break out in fact this sunscreen helped my oily skin get under control. It hydrates without being oily! I don't even need moisturizer with this sunscreen. Thank you ulta for carrying this gem! * not waterproof...this product is a joke.
says "" if sweating or swimming, use a waterproof sunscreen ""

Really? what's the point of a sunscreen?
And the customer service was least helpful. * I rarely give product reviews but two thumbs up for this sunscreen!  I have used several types and brands of sunscreens and other Shiseido sunscreens as well.  This, by far, is the best for me as it applies really smooth on my skin, sits well under my make-up, and never leaves that white residue on my face.  It has enough SPF to protect my skin under the sun as I take a lot of outdoor photography plus it also leaves my face really moisturized throughout the day."

I've used cheap Hawaiian tropic 15 SPF sunscreen with bronzer for years, and I never should've cheated with Supergoop. Just as nice weather has arrived, I have sun marks that probably won't go away. Extremely disappointed. I've really been taking care of my skin for the past 5 years or so, and should've just kept using what I know. * I have very sensitive skin and this doesn't itritate it at all. Feels lightweight not sticky. Doesn't have a strong sunscreen smell. Has a bit of a white cast when you first put it on but it's not noticeable once it fully desolves into my skin. I'm a fan!"

Elated I finally found suncreen I actually want to wear! The tube is a little funky but a gentle squeeze as you pump the top and you're good to go. * I've tried pretty much every mineral sunscreen on the market, only to absolutely hate the way it feels and looks on my skin or it burns my sensitive eyes.... BUT this one checks all the boxes!  It doesn't leave a white cast, doesn't feel heavy or burn your eyes and actually feels really nice on the skin, plus leaves a smooth canvas for makeup.  Highly recommend and as long as they continue to make it, I will continue to use this sunscreen product exclusively. * I ordered two tubes (it was on sale!) and the pump on both tubes was defective. I could not get the product out of the tube to try it. I tried many different ways (short of cutting the tube open). I am so disappointed. * The product is fine. The packaging is horrible. No matter how much I pump, nothing comes out. The only way is to get any product is to squeeze the bottle and pump at the same time. * I initally bought this sunscreen because I had a few moles on my face surgically removed, my dermatologist gave me a gel to clear up the scars but it hadn't worked the way I hoped after a few months. My incision sight was still pretty deep and uneven. After only a week of applying this sunscreen both on my face and directly to my scars they faded even more than they previously had with the prescribed gel!!! It works wonders!! Both for general scars and also acne scars or pigmentation. Swear it always clears them up for me overnight. A little goes a long wayyyy. It's also the perfect size for traveling and on the go application. My skin is super soft after too, there are no cons to it. I love it! * Its okay, personally think there is a smell to it and i think its a little strong and i do not like it. It also pills and doesnt feel like my skin really absorbs it. Will finish the bottle but wont repurchase. * I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I bought this several months ago and I gave it a good shot but I can not believe so many people love this.
It's grainy, leaves a horrible white cast even on my very fair skin and just sits on the skin wrong. It doesn't sink in and dries and flakes and leaves white residue all over my clothes and eyebrows and somehow also is horribly greasy all day, and I have no idea why but no matter what I do it spreads and ends up in my eyes after about an hour after applying and it HURTS."

Because of this, you cannot wear it under foundation otherwise you'll have a big mess on your face. I've been using it for about a year now but I'm currently looking for another brand.

Great price! * I purchased this item when it first came out, and I was very excited to support a black owned brand and have another option for a mineral sunscreen that wouldn't look crazy on darker skin. It does blend in very well, although it still has a slight light cast as any mineral sunscreen is going to. However, I noticed that it would pill throughout the day. I tend to unconsciously rub my face throughout the day, and I would get little bits of sunscreen on my hands. I tried using other products underneath thinking my vitamin c or my moisturizer was the issue, but no matter what combination it always pilled. * I have dry skin and really wanted to try this out but I didn't know it gave a matte finish so I follow it up with a water resistant sunscreen from black girl sunscreen. * This product leaves no white cast and has a matte finish which is a plus however it pills very easily and flakes off throughout the day. Due to this, I am unable to apply any sort of blush/ highlight/ etc. after application as it will cause the sunscreen to flake off which is clearly not ideal. For reference I have combination skin. * I've tried this several times since I purchased it and no matter what I try, it pills up and flakes all day whether alone or under makeup, with or without my skincare.  After seeing the rave reviews I had really high hopes for this.  The search continues! * I bought this sunscreen along with the Supergoop unseen sunscreen and I am returning the supergoop sunscreen and keeping this one. I have medium skin and this doesn't leave a white cast. I love that it works well with my skincare and under my makeup. I haven't had no issues with it pilling on me or it making my face look extra greasy. I wish that it had a higher spf but I  will still be repurchasing. * Blended in well with my skin color no white cast and is not greasy at all. The only thing I didn't like about this sunscreen is that it pills a lot on its own (so I definitely would not wear it under makeup)."

So much better than using a primer! Be sure to wash your face and moisturize prior to applying the sun screen and makeup. It really helps to keep your skin from feeling dry. 

The consistency is very liquidy. It doesnt feel sticky. Although it does leave a white cast when worn alone so I avoid doing so. Instead, I apply the Shiseido stick sun screen when im bare faced. I havent experienced any eye irritations with this."

Super fresh smelling and easy application. It actually smell's so good I couldn't believe it was spf 30. Identical to the look and feel of the old favaorite hempz lotion. I've been working in the beauty industry for more than a decade and I can't remember a time that I didn't have a pump of that lotion laying around. This will be a new staple in my beach bag absolutely! * Hi!  My name is Lisa and I'm a fan of This Hempz SPF 30 sunscreen has become one of my new favorites. The Sweet Pineapple and Honey Melon scent is perfect for summer, it reminds me of a tropical beach vacation. Hempz products are super moisturizing, formulated with 100% Hemp Seed Oil, they leave my skin feeling soft and nourished. This SPF also has Vitamin C for additional skin care benefits, I've noticed it adds a nice glow and evens out my overall complexion. I like that I can use this for protection against the sun and still get some healthy color. If you are looking for a new SPF that provides rich hydration, never leaves a white cast and smells amazing try this! This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I really like the texture of this SPF it is very lightweight and it doesn't leave a white cast.  But I don't like the stickiness when it drying down. I love the smell of this it smells Delicious and sweet. It has vitamin C in it which helps brighten your skin and the hemp seed oil is moisturizing which is a plus. My skin feels and look very hydrating. I put SPF on my face faithfully every day, but I always forget to put SPF on my body and if you do the same I think this would be perfect because it just feels like lotion, not an SPF so I would grab it and throw it in my bag on the go and use it everyday due to the smell. * Summer is upon us and as much as we know and are reminded to put spf on our faces, often the rest of our body is neglected.  As a verified 9 year beauty expert, I find that if you find a body lotion that is easy to apply, especially with all this humidity, that goes on clear, and is quickly absorbed by the body, you have a winner.  The Hempz Sweet Pineapple and Honey Melon goes beyond that with its moisturising hemp oil and its tropical scent that engulfs the body. * I recently took the Hempz Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon Herbal Body Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF 30 on our family trip and my whole family tried and loved it! I am a mom of 3 and I am an avid Sunscreen user and I intend to pass down the habit of applying and reapplying as well so finding a sunscreen we all enjoy is a must! 

Both my sons really enjoyed the fun and fruit tropical scent! It's very sweet and yummy. I definitely pick up some of that sweet pineapple and the scent doesn't linger so if that's not your style this may still work for you! 

It was easy to apply, it's absorbed quickly and was not overly thick or sticky. It was a great texture and as far as reapplying goes, it was also easy and quick to absorb even after being in the sun and the pool! * This sunscreen has a delightful tropical scent of sweet pineapple and honey melon. Its creamy texture absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue, providing excellent hydration and leaving my skin feeling soft and moisturized. With SPF 30 protection, it's perfect for everyday use. Highly recommended for its refreshing scent and effective moisturizing properties! * I love this sunscreen by HEMPZ because it is cruelty free and vegan! It has become my favorite scent it reminds me of the lotion after they use after a mani/pedi! I love it, it always feel like there's a weird coating on my arms after putting on lotion but this one is soft! It is lightweight and rubs in easily! It is also so refreshing and smooth which I love!"

Following the directions I apply generously to face and neck, but didn't re-apply every 2 hours--just once more in the middle of the day on no makeup days. The tube lasted less than 2 weeks using it this way. WAY too spendy * I received this product as a sample initially, and I will say that I hesitated to try it because I usually only use products labeled ""clean"" and ""cruelty-free"" and this is neither of those. Additionally, this moisturizer has a slight fragrance which would usually disqualify it from my regimen but I got hooked on the scent and the effect. I had 2 small wrinkles between my eyebrows and after using this, they're gone. I use this over my serums and facial creams and I'll buy this again and again. * I love the moisturizing, glowy feeling of the product with SPF! Perfect for daily use. * I don't ever leave reviews bit hos product is amazing! I have worked for dermatology offices for years and have been fortunate to try many different sunscreen products but this one may be my favorite ever! It's not sticky, goes on smooth and leaves a beautiful glow and looks so natural! * This product goes on very heavy and greasy so I was already nervous.  I headed out on a hike and six miles in, it started melting and oozing into my eyes.  There was nothing I could do at that point. Worst sunscreen ever. Buy Goop Unseen Sunscreen. * Best SPF ever. I love the glowy finish and it even works under my makeup. * I tried this in store while shopping and immediately fell in love, I've been using it for 2 weeks now. The glow that it gives my skin is beautiful, it also does not leave a white cast nor feels like a traditional SPF. I even tried it under makeup and it made everything look dewier and smoother. I highly recommend!"
240,240,240,240,sun bum,mineral lotion spf 30,pimprod2021610,2575600," * I love Sun Bum products and really wanted to love this. I was looking for a high SPF mineral formula without too much of a white cast. This was OK on first application - a little thick though so you need to work it in; then as you reapply, it turns into glue. Takes a lot to get it off of your body in the shower. However, no sunburns with multiple applications. No skin irritation. * It's not terrible, but I do not like it remotely, HALF as much as I like the Ulta brand one. I'm new to mineral sunscreens and I bought 2 from Sun Bum and 1 from Ulta. Both of the Sun Bum mineral sunscreens (SPF 30 and 50) are chunky and ridiculously harder to spread on the body. I felt like I was spreading toothpaste, or bondo on my legs and arms. I couldn't imagine trying to put it on my face. The Ulta brand is a sheer delight to put on in comparison. I felt like I COULDN'T rub it in and get past the white cast, and I am so pale I could blend in with a cloud. After seeing how hard it was on my legs (30SPF) and arms (50SPF), I didn't DARE use it on my face and I used the Ulta instead. 50SPF was the intended sunscreen for the face, but that wasn't happening with how delicate my face is from acne right now. Yeesh. I'll use the Sun Bums, and my husband will, but I definitely wouldn't repurchase it. Makes me reconsider the entire line from this brand after both tubes were so much chunkier in consistency and THICCER than your girls thighs versus Ulta's. * This is thick upon applying it, but after about 10 minutes it settles. I love this for my sensitive, allergy-prone skin. It is also chemical free which is great for sensitive skin! My favorite part is the no white cast. I don't know how they managed to do it without tinting it, but this is POC friendly. Also doesn't pill like most physical sunscreens do. * I purchased to use as a moisturizer sunscreen per recommendation of store associate to protect hyperpigmentation. This product is very thick and sticky. It burns my skin also. Not a good purchase. * I used the spf 50 version of this formula, but sadly it was too heavy for me and caused breakouts. This formula seems much lighter, the white cast is not bad, and the feel is good! Still a bit on the heavier side of sunscreens for me, which is why this is going to be my go-to winter sunscreen. I won't bother to look for another, this one does it the best! * A little background on my skin: I'm a redhead and have very fair/ pale skin (alabaster foundation) which is moderately sensitive and burns easily (and won't ever tan, it just peels and burns again). This sunscreen uses fragrance, but doesn't irritate my skin. It feels lightweight and not greasy. The formula is thin enough to easily apply and rub in quickly (much better than the Cotz mineral sunscreen for face and body, non tinted). It smells like coconut, which I love, and doesn't leave a cast or sticky grease layer on my skin.
If you have a deeper complexion than me and are concerned about a cast, I couldn't say for sure but I think this stuff is worth a try since it's so thin and rubs in so well. If you have very sensitive skin, just tread carefully as the scent is very strong. Definitely worth a try, but keep the receipt just in case it doesn't work for you. Hope this helps! * The only downside is that this uses fragrance. Thankfully, my skin isn't extremely sensitive so this is okay for me, but if you have very sensitive skin or are allergic to coconut I would tread carefully if you try this. If you don't have sensitive skin, it smells so nice and absorbs quickly without leaving a cast. However, I have very pale skin (I usually use Alabaster foundation with cool undertone) and don't know if this will leave a cast if you have a deeper complexion. It's thin enough that it's probably worth a try though, since you can rub it in so well. Hope this is helpful!"

This Product received a poor raring on Yuka App. Product contains many harmful ingredients including dimethicone  which harms the environment and ends up in the blood of fish, birds and mammals building up in the environment without ever breaking down. Cotz advertising is an example of brand green washing at its finest. * This is good for touch ups when you're on the go. Despite being a stick format, it has a mousse like texture. I like that it can fit in a pocketbook (the cylinder shape makes it awkward for a pants pocket). This does feel heavy on my skin (normal/balanced type) and has a sticky/tacky feel after application. This also left a whitecast on my skin (Fitzpatrick type 2, fair Asian Skin, wear clinque foundation in shade bone; I swiped at least 4x per section of my face to have adequatecl coverage). The finish is definitely on the shiny side, especially for me. My preference is for matte or skinlike finish, so this was too shiny for me, but someone who likes a glowy finish may like this. I would recommend this for someone with fair skin on the dry side (or balanced/normal in a dry climate) and doesn't mind a shinier/""glowy"" finish."

I do rub it in well and have learned to avoid my eyelids, but around my eyes is fine. If you have oily skin, this one may not stay put. I have combination skin, fair and pink and prone to sunburn. It is one of the only mineral sunscreens that I will put on my face because I'm prone to breakouts. It's this or Cotz. Since Cotz is a tiny tube for the money, I got this to travel with and not need a separate body sunscreen. I've never gone back!

On your body, be sure to rub it in well. If you don't, it will transfer to your clothes. * It leaves a horrible white cast, and melts off when I sweat.

I'll use this up on my feet or arms I guess. * The scent is super strong and leaves a white cast. * It does NOT smell like sunscreen and it protects so well.

Glad I purchased while on sale because not worth the full price.  Will keep to use on hands and neck since it does not smell and still need sunscreen protection. * I live by Avene products and wanted to love this so badly. Maybe I got a bad batch, but there is a lingering smell to this that I just cant get past. * As someone who has tried dozens of sunscreens, this one is elite in my opinion. The skincare in it makes my skin so glowy and hydrating and I love how dewy my skin looks when wearing. It wears well under make up, but you do have to rub it in well to prevent the white cast and so that the product absorbs in fully. It does feel a little bit sticky and a little heavy, but I don't necessarily mind that. Overall it feels more like skincare than sunscreen in my opinion and I will definitely repurchase."

I believe it's the tocopheryl. :( * Very irritating * I need to wear sunscreen daily because of my acne products, but I've yet to find one that doesn't clog my pores even further. Seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I bought this when it was on sale. Sadly, it doesn't live up to the hype. It was lightweight on my skin, but it smells like cheap body sunblock. And every time I used it I had a new zit forming by the end of the day, without changing anything else in my skin routine. I wanted this to work so badly, but it does the opposite of being good for acne prone skin. * I was going to give 4 stars because it has a Proactiv scent I'm not in love with, However 5 stars because it does a great job as an spf as well as clearing up your face at the same time. * Since I am using retinol, my dermatologist insists that I wear sunscreen.  I have struggled to find any spf sunscreen that my reactive sensitive oily acne-prone mature skin doesn't breakout to and react to.

This is my first facial sunscreen success.  This one is great!  Doesn't leave me greasy or overly shiny.  Doesn't irritate or break out my skin.  I only wish it was higher spf, but better spf 30 than nothing. * I have very oily skin and hate wearing SPF. I have trial and errored so many mositurizers and this is the best one.

This one feels very gritty going on takes a good while to absorb and dry down and it pilled as well. Does feel better after applying the moisturizer as recommended. Face now feels soft and not oily or greasy. Not sure if I will continue to use as my spf after this is finished, also small amount and expensive to use every day. * It is a more than wonderful serum for oily skin. It makes the skin clear, fresh, hydrated and free of blemishes. Youthful, attractive and vibrant. It makes the skin like the skin of children. It is like magic for the skin. * I lobe beautystat all products. vitamin C serum looks amazing would love to try. * I love the texture of this product so much & what it does for my skin. * This is one of my faves from beautystat! This has vitamin c in it as well as sunscreen! I love this two in one daily serum, not only does it protect me from the daily harmful rays but it also helps brighten my skin as it's preventing & eliminating my dark spots, wrinkles, and fine lines! I've only tried this for a few weeks and I can already see the difference and smoothness in my face and my neck! You should give it a try, followed by their amazing moisturizer! * Very good serum and it's a good price. I highly recommend it. I will continue to buy it. It brightens up my skin. * This has a gritty texture and leaves a little bit of a white cast. But thats expected from a mineral SPF and a small price to pay for a good formula. I feel good about using this as my daily protection because it gives my skin the brightening benefits of vitamin c.  Ill repurchase this. Its worth the money."
247,247,247,247,peter thomas roth,max vitamin d-fense sunscreen serum broad spectrum spf 50,pimprod2037937,2606105," * super soft and light weight makes my skin glow i have a mixed skin type so im not really oily but this is the second bottle im going to get!!! (: literally love it and recommend if you want sunscreen thats light and watery and makes your skin glow < 3 * Skin is glowing and protected * I recently switched from Cerave am spf30 which left my skin feeling dry and would have to combine with cocoa butter. I've been using this product for about 2 weeks. I have eczema and this leaves my face feeling moisturized for the entire day. No white cast, lightweight but offered full coverage. A little goes a long way. It's good but expensive which is my reason for the 4 stars. My face feels more hydrated and softer. * I've been trying this sunscreen for almost a week now. It applies nicely on the skin at first but my face looks greasy. Do not put this sunscreen near your eyes it made mine irritated and gave a stinging feeling throughout the day. It has the typical sunscreen smell but it is not too heavy. Small breakouts. Save your money from this product it is not all that."
248,248,248,248,peter thomas roth,max matte shine control sunscreen broad spectrum spf 45,pimprod2023948,2579754," * This product isnt matte at all * I like the no shine look * One of the best mattifying sunscreens I've tried! Its perfect for my very oily skin and actually keeps me matte most of the day! I'm not in a very humid climate though. It works very well as a primer underneath a tinted moisturizer I use as well. * Sits on skin. Doesn't sink in. Stays white and wipes right off. * Nice sunscreen! Dries matte. Don't rub it in too much, it will roll off on your skin. * I love the way it absorbs into my oily skin and gives me a matt finish. It's not greasy and it's not fragrant. It is wonderful for in the hot Alabama sun and damp winter. * I have combo skin that in summer humidity is extremely oily and acne prone. This product is the absolute best product I have ever used to control shine, including regular non SPF moisturizers. Normally, I have to blot my face a dozen times a day, no exaggeration, and with this I don't have to blot at all! Life changing! It works amazing under makeup and the sun protection lasts all day. This does not dry the skin and I used it alone without another moisturizer. I use this even when not going outside just for the matte finish. It does not cause acne either. LOVE it. I read another review that mentioned pilling, I did not experience this."

250,250,250,250,supergoop!,play 100% mineral lotion spf 50 with green algae,pimprod2037485,2606309," * So, i guess mineral sunscreens just arent meant for me. I tried a bit on my hand in the store and was hopeful because it didnt leave a shiny grease spot on me, and i didnt notice the white pallor it left (dang tricky store lighting) but with the first face application, i could see i made a mistake. I am VERY fair to begin with and now i look like Casper with this lotion! Add to it the slight sting it causes and dry flaky skin the next day and this is just ALL bad. Only reason i gave 2 stars is because of the non-greasyness * I wanted to try something new for once. I put it on, it felt fine and looked fine. the next day I woke up and my face was flaky, red, and burning. I couldn't go anywhere for a few days not even to work! * I bought this sunscreen becuase i have heard good things about Supergoop! and becuase this is a mineral based sunscreen. I already knew that the zinc oxide in this gives a white cast, but I was not prepared how hard I had to rub my skin to get this slighlty blended into my skin. Would not purchase again * When I first tried it on my hand, I felt it rubbed in we'll so I was hopeful because it's so hard to find sunscreen for brown skin tones. But after using it fully on my face and arms, it started to pill when I had moisturizer, cream, or eczema ointment underneath. It was kind of like it turned to hard paste when trying to rub into skin because the consistency changed. It was pilling on my arms more because I put moisturizer beforehand. I put it on my face without moisturizer underneath and had a white cast for at least 4 hours until the natural oils on my face came in and flushed it out a bit. It's not for darker complexions. It has a chalky sunscreen smell. It's very pricey for sunscreen and I expected better. * I read a review on here that said this sunscreen leaves a white cast and I 100% attest to that. It's a pretty strong white cast that might work for a day at the beach but not for regular use. Hopefully Supergoop! can make a mineral sunscreen for darker complexions but for now I'll continue using their Play: Everyday Lotion SPF 30. * Wanted to like this because its 100% mineral but the white overcast on my complexion is too much for me to use. The regular Play lotion works better for me. * Love this as a mineral lotion option for sunscreen! Smells so good too!"
251,251,251,251,mario badescu,mineral sunscreen spf 30,pimprod2032183,2594658," * It is mineral, is not greasy, doesn´t leave a white cast BUT I preffer something more liquid, more light.
And it expensive considering the content. * this sunscreen is great. at first i was not a fan but as continued to use it i found that the pros outweighed the cons. what i love about it is that one pump goes a long way and it spreads nicely. i also love that it doesnt leave a white cast. i apply this on my facial hair and it dries clear. its pretty insane. i was gagged when it dried clear on my BEARED! i was sold after that. it also leaves the skin tacky and glowy, which i love. the only con is that its watery but i noticed that it allows the sunscreen to spread and glide across the skin nicley. like i said, a little goes a long way. i think for people with facial hair, its hard to reach the skin underneath, so i do use more than the avergave person. its a decent amount of product for the price but for people who need to use more, it can be just enough for like a month. nonethless, she did what needed to be done. * I usually don't write reviews but I had such a terrible experience with this product that I felt it was only fair to share my results because my skin looked the worst that it has ever looked in my life!!

I had been using Mario Badescu's Hydro Moisturizer w/ Vit C and my skin was looking great with no breakouts.  Unfortunately, that moisturizer doesn't have SPF in it so I decided to try this sunscreen.  My skin isn't sensitive, but it could not handle this sunscreen. I experienced terrible breakouts around my jawline (which has never happened before) and it took a long time for my skin to clear.

I am a fan of Mario B's products, just not this one… * This is the most misunderstood sunscreen. It is so beautiful and lightweight. The glow is so  amazing! It wears beautifully under makeup too! * has a white cast… * I am always looking for a good mineral sunscreen. The ladies at Ulta recommended this one -and they were right! 
Lightweight, blends easily, slight white cast when first applied (I expect that with a mineral formula) but after waiting the requisite 15 minutes-it has disappeared into my skin. 
Good price point too * I've finally found a sunscreen that works for me. Mineral sunscreen tends to leave a white cast, but I did not have that with this one. I can layer it on top of my serums and moisturizer with no pilling, and it extremely lightweight compared to what I've used in the past. I generally hate using sunscreen, too, but this one is so easy to use that I can see myself using it all year long (as we should be protecting our skin, even in the winter months). I'm also prone to acne and cysts, and I have yet to have a problem and I've been using this stuff since May."
252,252,252,252,undefined beauty,r&r sun elixir spf 30 glow oil,pimprod2045033,2626500," * I really wanted to try an oil sunscreen but unfortunately my skin type did not like it. All the ingredients sounded attractive as skincare! I tried layering with moisturizer, or just a very lightweight serum or even with nothing underneath but my makeup would not stay put :( I did wear it on non-makeup days and even if it felt like it was there, I could tell my skin was hydrated and did not look oily at all. But what I really did not like, and this is personal taste, was the fragrance. It is a great fragrance for say a body lotion in my opinion but it lingered for the rest of the day and I did not enjoy it since it felt too strong. I would love all the skincare benefits without the fragrance, even it if it smells amazing! Overall, I'd say it is a great product if your skin loves oils (apparently mine does not :( ), and maybe if your face doesn't like it the skin on the rest of your body will! * This elixir is a perfect body glow that also protects you from the sun.  It is a bit too oily for my face but on my chest and shoulders its absolutely amazing.  Would highly recommend for the body. * I love this sunscren oil * I love the day serum and frequently use the night serum over that because I love the glow. I was using the sun serum over that to give the UV protection. Now I get the glow and the UV protection in one product. Win Win!! I also love the scent and the feel of the product on my skin. I love all of the Undefined products but this may be my new favorite. 😍 * I was lucky enough to test this innovative product before launch. Sun protection is a must for me and Sun Elixir is a game-changer. The unique oil formula glides on seamlessly, leaving no sticky or heavy residue behind. However, my favorite thing about Sun Elixir is its light floral fragrance. If I could, I'd bottle it up and wear it as perfume. With just a quick application as the last step in my routine, I'm ready to take on the day feeling effortlessly glowy and protected * Beautiful product. Glowing, hydrating and feels great in my mature dry skin! I'm so in love with this line. All of the products feel great and give me a pick me up! Love the sun serum tint. Hope for some undefined cream make up. * I started with the 1st Elixir that was made, and fell in love. The smell and oil made my dry face smooth and soft. When this sun Elixir was made I had to try it out, and I'm glad I did. The smell is AMAZING, and the way it hydrates my face and neck making it soft and smooth feeling, I'm in love AGAIN.. I'm a fan for life. I will definitely be buying more.."

254,254,254,254,pacifica,kind tint spf 30 tinted serum - broad spectrum mineral sunscreen,pimprod2037577,2604656," * This product feels like rubbing clay on your face, super drying and difficult to blend even on fair skin would not recommend * Goes on smoothly and has a slight scent to it. I don't notice any color tho. So nice for a sunscreen that sinks into your skin but my skin looks no different in tone after putting it on. * This is super lightweight, moisturizing, and easy to blend. It doesn't have a noticeable tint once its applied, and the spf level is great for everyday use but not prolonged sun exposure. A lot of reviews mention whitecast or pilling- I haven't had issues with either. I am very pale though. I only use it with other pacifica products, which might help prevent pilling. It's nice but I'll probably opt for the spf30 lotion once I run out. * apples like chalk * Actyally the worst sunscreen ever :( HORRIBLE white cast and pilled an insane amount. I waited for all of my products to absorb before putting this on and it still pilled like crazy and left an AWFUL white cast * I love Pacifica's Vitamin Sea SPF and was looking for a less oily version, but unfortunately this SPF leaves an awful white cast despite it being tinted * Really great spf for sensitive and acne prone skin but it leaves an insane white cast on my face that's really difficult to blend. I'm medium with a neutral undertone and I wear kosas foundation in 200 for reference."
255,255,255,255,andalou naturals,deep hydration daily shade + blue light defense spf 30,pimprod2038704,2609916," * Not in love with this product. I have had some sunscreens that are too oily and make me shiny or break out and it doesn't do that. But it has a white cast and peels. Not good under makeup either. Overall pass. * At first i loved it except the strong fragrance. After a week of use its leaving ny skin burning. I hope i can return. I really wantes to be able to use this because i do like the consistency and how quickly it absorbs. * I love the clean ingredients, it leaves no white cast, feels light on the skin, and doesn't make my makeup pill! Seriously my ride or die."
