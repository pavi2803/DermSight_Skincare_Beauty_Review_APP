Every time I have it on I get compliments on the glow of my skin. It even has SPF 30, which is a great feature. Even the nurse in my dermatologist office asked me what I was wearing and complemented me. * Love this sunscreen!  Best I've ever used
Lasted all day 
Didn't have to reapply even when laying in my pool for hours! * I wanted to love it. The price point was what sold me so, I decided to give it a try this summer. I had never used a gel sunscreen and it just didn't work for me. It doesn't go on well with makeup. The end result ends up looking like your face is peeling. * its a little pricey and it's personaly too glowy for me, but overall its a great product! * If you like glowy luminous skin and sunscreen that doenst feel like sunscreek then you will love this. I know I do. I've been using this now for about two years. It's one of my favorites. * Kinda grainy and greasy and too warm a tone. I love several Tula products, but this was not one for me. But the couple times I used it, it didn't seem to irritate my skin. * this sunscreen has a lot of pros, skincare and the dewy glow it gives while being super lightweight. i have super sensitive skin and could barley tolerate this most days becsuse of how much it would sting and burn or make my skin breakout in a rash. some days i could tolerate it but most says i couldnt, i swear it made me burn more when i took it to the beach. just beware if you put sunscreen on your neck chest and face and dont wear any AHA/BHA/or chemical exfoliants your skin will breakout. this is  for ppl w a great skin barrier"

The only downside to this product is that it notes a necessary re-application every 40 minutes if swimming or sweating. The swimming part I don't care about, but I'm an oily gal in the summertime. That's a lot of re-applicating, especially considering the amount you're getting for the price. Just some food for thought. * Love using this sunscreen * I repurchased this sunscreen when it was part of Ulta's Beauty Steals. I love this sunscreen as it's easy to wear, doesn't leave a white cast on my skin, and doesn't cause breakouts. I gave it four stars because at the regular price, I would try to find a cheaper alternative. * I bought this by accident, thinking I was getting the tinted version which I love. When I opened it and saw it was the Unseen version, I thought I'd try it. I really like it! Even when I use tinted Supergoop! on my face, I use this for my neck, décolleté, and hands. When I choose to use this on my face, it goes on smoothly, feels much like a primer, and works great with makeup. It's a keeper for me! * A family member loves the sunscreen, so I am always buying it for them. For me it can pill  time to time. 

However, I do like the texture of this. No white  cast. 
If you don't have acne prone skin, then this is a good option * This product goes on so silky and smooth. Love it. Does the job. * Very light and doesn't leave a residue on skin."

This sunscreen blends well, but leaves a dewy shiny finish; so much so that even matte foundations can't cover it and my skin gets oily within a couple of hours. * Did not like this product.

My sister tried it out as well and it did as well for her. * I first bought this sunscreen in stores and overrall, fell in love with it! Worked for daily use and didnt leave a white cast however I first bought it when I wasnt training in high uv and heat so it worked until uv rays started increasing so now the uv went through the sunscreen and now i am sun burnt 😛🥲 * I love love love this. I suffer from melasma and hyperpigmentation, this has slowly started to reverse all of that. I used to use the spf60 and bought this since i forgot mynsumscreen on a trip.

The mousse spreads easily and absorbs right in leaving my skin feeling moisturized and silky smooth. It has an almost banana scent, that lasts and lasts, which I LOVE! It boats l boasts an 80 minute water resistance, which I don't doubt for one second. * If you're a fan of a fun and playful skincare routine look no further then Vacation's Classic Whip Sunscreen Mousse. The packaging is incredibly adorable, resembling a can of whipped cream. It's , unlike any traditional sunscreen you've ever seen. It's hard not to smile every time you use it! This super unique product transforms sunscreen application into a playful experience for anyone using it. The airy, whipped cream like texture feels luxurious on the skin and blends smoothly and seamlessly. A little bit goes long way leaving behind no greasy or sticky residue. Once melted in it gives the skin a soft and hydrated feeling from coconut oil and aloe vera. It's perfect for those who hate that heavy sunscreen feeling, especially in the hot summer months. Plus, it's water-resistant for up to 80 minutes, so you're  whether you're lounging by the pool getting a tan or jumping in you are covered. It provides SPF 30, this sunscreen provides broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection shielding your skin from the sun's harmful rays. With its delightful scent and effective formula, it's a summer skincare must-have. It's a perfect blend of effective sun protection and a dash of fun that makes you look forward to applying sunscreen all year long. * This feels almost like something you would get from a party favor store. I feel like it's a quality product that got it's hype due to it's experience and playful nature while also being effective. For its pricing I'm unsure as to weather I would repeatedly purchase for daily use however if this were on sale I would restock. The texture is fun and lightweight and the application is easy. I was not left with a whitecast - however if your skin is dry I needed to apply additional moisturizer because moisturization just isn't what this sunscreen was giving. It gives playful, it gives protection from the sun and it gives ease. Also, it's such a different product and simply leaving it within view of someone else will get a conversation started. I really do enjoy this - I did see other reviews and took head to their warming and avoided applying to my face. * I have absolutely loved this whipped body sunscreen. It is so easy to apply and I also love that it doesn't have a strong scent. I highly recommend this and will absolutely purchase it again. * Vacation Inc.'s **Classic Whip SPF 30 sunscreen** has quickly become a summer staple for me. The moment I apply it, I'm transported back to my childhood summers at my grandmother's house, thanks to its unique coconut and sunscreen scent. It truly captures the essence of tropical bliss, making me feel like I'm lounging at the beach or by the pool. The whipped texture is not only fun to use but also incredibly moisturizing, leaving my skin feeling soft and hydrated without any greasy residue.

One of the standout features of this sunscreen is its impressive formulation. It glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly, which is a huge plus for someone who dislikes the sticky feel of traditional sunscreens. I love that it doesn't leave a white cast, making it suitable for all skin tones. The SPF 30 protection gives me peace of mind while enjoying the sun, though I do wish it offered a higher SPF for those long beach days. Still, the combination of nourishing ingredients like coconut oil and aloe vera makes this product feel like a treat for my skin.

The packaging is adorable, resembling whipped cream, which adds a playful touch to my skincare routine—though I remind myself not to eat it! Overall, Vacation's Classic Whip is more than just sunscreen; it's a delightful experience that evokes joyful memories while providing effective sun protection. If you're looking for a sunscreen that smells amazing and feels luxurious on your skin, I highly recommend giving this one a try! * I recently tried the Vacation Classic Whip SPF 30 Sunscreen Mousse, and I'm hooked! First off, the mousse texture is so fun—it feels like you're applying a fluffy dessert on your skin. It's super lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving no greasy residue or white cast, which is a big plus for me.

The SPF 30 protection is solid, and I love that it's broad spectrum, so I know I'm covered from both UVA and UVB rays. The hydrating ingredients like coconut oil and aloe vera make my skin feel soft and smooth, even after a full day in the sun.

The scent is amazing! It instantly takes me back to summers by the pool with its mix of coconut, banana, and even that pool toy vibe. It's fun, nostalgic, and unlike any other sunscreen I've used.

I also appreciate that it's vegan and cruelty-free, plus it's free from all the harmful stuff like parabens and oxybenzone. Overall, Vacation Classic Whip SPF 30 is not just a sunscreen—it's a total summer experience in a bottle. Highly recommend if you want sun protection that's both effective and fun to use! * Im honestly allergic to so many sunscreens and this is the only one I am not allergic too. The formula is rich and so gentle on my skin. I wear this all over my face and body when the sun is out. Gives me an amazing tan while protecting me from harmful rays. 10/10 loveee it"

I contacted customer support and they sent me another. It also wasnt full. It didnt seem to have leaked, but the product pictures show it 100% full. I went to Ulta to investigate, and none of the stock was full. This one isnt on Ulta—It's false advertising by Kopari. I like the sprayer and havent had that break like other reviewers (yet) but for that price and with those product pictures, Kopari is really taking your money with this one. It also doesnt seem to dry down, which I would hate on the beach, but also hate on a regular day without sand. * This don't shimmer like advertised. It leaves at best a lil sheen which is more oily than anything but any glittery sparkly affect is non existent. It's just overpriced spray sunscreen * I love the application, its a good mist and i looove the goow and smell. My obly con us that it finishes so quickly * this product is a dream. it sprays on smoothly, and no need to rub in unless you want to. gives shine but not oily. subtle fragrance, and layerable with other fragrances. this part is hard to describe, so it's moisturizing, like your skin will feel good, but not like a body oil/butter feeling because it absorbs well and doesn't sit on the skin.  overall I'm buying it again, so it's a win. * I loved this sunscreen. I used it on my sensitive skin, my son used it because I sprayed it on him as well. The SPF did it's job. Perfect for the beach because every so many hours you can keep spraying it. Yes, a bit pricy, but worth the hype. * I was excited to try this product but it did not do justice for me. I am a tanned girl and the shimmer was just too subtle for my skin tone. I felt like the shimmer disappeared after an hour. I hope to have better luck with other Kopari products * So many have said their pump broke or they got burned anyway. Mine works great. I LOVE this stuff! I dont burn, its beautiful on, its not terribly greasy and spraying it on is so convenient. It is pricey and ive gone through the bottle fast but i will for sure re-purchase!"

They will happily apply and re-apply this like any other moisturizer. My husband also doesnt mind reapply this even at work. I took my most recent jug on a bachelorette trip and we all left glowing without sunburning. * Really happy with this sunscreen so far! Usually my least favorite part about sunscreen is how oily and greasy I feel and look, but this one dries/absorbs really nicely so I do not look like I am shining/oily from the sunscreen layer.  I also haven't had any issues with staining on clothes, which I have had issues with other sunscreens. * This sunscreen is fantastic! Unlike most sunscreens, this one doesn't have a white cast and it doesn't feel sticky. It's expensive but definitely worth the price. * I like to travel with this sunscreen. It works to protect my whole body.  Excellent. * I never write reviews, but this is truly one of the best beauty products I've ever added to my routine. I have very dry skin and this keeps me so glowy and just makes my skin look so healthy. I can definitely see it in my skin when I'm not using it. It has improved the look of my skin over time as well it's always so soft and it helps to calm down my redness. BUY THIS !!! * I love all other supergoop products, however this one smelt like mosquito spray to me & left me very oily. I will be returning this item unfortunately. * I was surprised at how incredible it makes my skin look. On top of providing protection. During heat waves (like right now) it does make my skin look oily and bloated — so i use another brand instead"

Usually haveing to settle for 50 or 60, since these are more widely available and higher spf's leave a white cast. Although I am happy to say this has littlw no white cast (blends very well) and leaves you glowing. * So i bought 2 of these. Thinkining i could use 
this for my face. Its Very overpriced. I love that it has high coverage. When applied to my face its very thick and I look shiny and I feel like I can see my sweat. And stings if used near eyes. I will only use it for my body. 
And i will not purchase again. * I have both lupus and a condition called MCAS- the latter essentially meaning I'm allergic to anything and everything, and the ""rules"" of what I'm allergic to changes daily- this is the one and ONLY sunscreen that doesn't cause my butterfly rash to burn or trigger an even worse full faced MCAS rash, and even better: no acne! Literally everything breaks me out or causes a reaction but not this. I am so happy to have found this SPF. My skin no longer feels like I'm pressed against a hot skillet when I have to be outside anymore. Of course, always wear a sunhat and clothing layers to protect your skin, too! But this truly is a miracle product for me. I hope to never be without it. Please, please, please, never discontinue or stop carrying this product. I was in tears to find something that works for me. I've never loved a peofuct more. * I love this sunscreen, was using the spf 60 and found this spf 100 at ulta. It's hard to find. The last few years I have developed a sensitivity to the sun beyond what normal people do. This stops my sun reactions and I don't look grey. Re-apply! * okay this sunscreen is actually really good! it doesnt break me out(which my skin is super sensitive to break outs and redness), gives me a slight glow, and obviously its spf 100 which is lovely for my fair skin. however, i play tennis a lot and even when im out for like 5 minutes and this is on my face i sweat like CRAZY even though im not even hot or tired or any of that. and when i actually do get hot and work out for a long time dear lord it looks like i just went on a 5k marathon through death valley. it doesnt bug me that much cause its protecting my skin but it is sorta annoying. also omg for the love of god do NOT get this anywhere near your eyes. i got this near my eyes and no matter how much i washed them or wiped my eyes my eyes were burning for 3+ hours. literally. they were watering so bad and i was blinking every millisecond and couldnt barely do anything. other than that its a really solid sunscreen if one you dont put it near your eyes and two you dont mind sweating(if youre being active/doing sports). * It's been too long since I last used sunscreen, but I recently started again because my skin tone was becoming uneven and the UV index has been high lately, ranging from 6 to 9 between 10 AM and 4 PM. I've noticed that my skin is returning to its regular shade. As a person with brown skin who spends about two hours a day in the sun, I recommend applying sunscreen every 90 minutes if you're exposed for a long time. It's a great product! * I honestly LOVE this formula. I was a little intimidated by the SPF 100 and was scared it was going to be thick and difficult to blend but I'm halway through my bottle and it's performing excellently! I've been using the SPF 60 for 3 years now and wanted to see if this was any different and I think I like this one better for makeup than the SPF 60. This one settles and dries down more than the SPF 60 surprisingly so I find it easier to apply makeup over this and I also dont feel like this gives me the ""sunscreen sheen"" on my face as much as fhe other one does which I found super surprising. There is a sliiight white cast but it's not really more noticeable than the SPF 60 white cast and both are pretty minimal. Can streak sometimes but that's very minimal too and I find it less streaky than the SPF 60 surprisingly. The only draw in my book is this tends to have a shorter expiration date than the SPF 60 but I'm sure it's hard to keep a ln SPF 100 formulation at 100 for an extended period of time. I hope they never discontinue this! Makes me feel more comfortable on the sunniest days (and ofc I reapply)"

The texture of this product is a thick balm that transforms into a oil. The texture is interesting and I like it. The product absorbed into the skin. The product is water-resistant.  It adds shine and glow to the skin. The product does have an orange tint when it is dispensed from the bottle. However, it does rub in clear. The bottle is a little hard to squeeze out. It does have SPF 30 which is amazing. I would recommend this product and I enjoyed using it. I did enjoy the scent of this product. I received compliments of how glowing and beautiful my skin looked. I use this only on my body and not on my face. I like the design of the bottle and the font. I have never tried the original so I was interested and this impressed me. * I received Orange Gelee Sunscreen for free from beauty tap, and vacation, which has a SPF 30 one of the best amount for UV light protection. First of all the tube is simple little hard to squeeze out the gel but cool colors on the packaging. I'm very impressed with the texture, consistency and the formula of this gel. Makes you remember old times with the family on the vacation when you were younger. The fresh breeze from the beach with a spike of orange. The gel you can easy apply, quick absorbing, smooth sensation, and soothing, calming and cooling feeling on your body and skin. Gives you a little bit a tan color after the application and it is water resistant for 8 hours. I will definitely recommend everyone to try if they like the gel version. This product is not vegan has chemical properties. If you have no issues with chemical sunscreen and no sensitive skin this would be your best option. Also if you like the gel oily feeling this would be the best spf that is in the market. I would give it a shot and see how feel about it. I use mine and I smell good even after the bath because the scent last kind for hours. * I'm a big fan of everything from Vacation, so when I heard about the Vacation Orange Gelee SPF 30 Sunscreen Gel, I couldn't wait to try it out. There's been so much buzz surrounding it, and I'm happy to say it completely lived up to the hype! The scent is absolutely delightful—refreshing and tropical, without being overpowering. The texture is smooth and gel-like, which makes it super easy to apply and blend into the skin.

What I love most is how it leaves my skin looking and feeling. It gives me that healthy, radiant glow, and I appreciate knowing that I'm protected with SPF 30. The added bonus is that it's not greasy at all, so my skin feels moisturized and soft without any sticky residue. It really gives off that luxe, high-end feel, making it the perfect addition to my daily skincare routine. Honestly, it's a game changer when it comes to combining sun protection and skincare with a little indulgence! * I recently received the opportunity to try the Vacation Orange Gelée SPF 30 Sunscreen Gel, and I excitedly state that I absolutely love it! 
Before I go into my experience with the product, let me say that the packaging and artwork totally need to be recognized! From the moment I opened the packaging, I was greeted by a scent that instantly transported me back to my summers as a child and those that must've been wearing the original product. The notes evoked such a strong sense of nostalgia, I remembered faces that I had not seen or thought about in a very long time. I know Vacation's goal was to recreate the original product and they really did a wonderful job, with both the design and the product (kudos to you!). 

The balm starts off with a thicker consistency, but it melts beautifully into the skin, providing some deep hydration without the greasy feeling that some sunscreens leave behind (and I absolutely despise). My skin felt incredibly moisturized after the application, which is definitely a huge plus for someone like me who often struggles with dry skin, especially with this crazy Florida weather. Plus, I really appreciate how it rubs on completely clear, yes...zero streaks and it leaves a beautiful natural glow that enhances my skin's complexion.

Overall, I absolutely recommend the Vacation Orange Gelée! It does such an amazing job blending effective sun protection with a nostalgic sensory experience that is absolutely divine. This sunscreen has earned a definite spot in my favorite summer essentials shelf and will be traveling with me in my beach bag!

This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I tried this sunscreen. It smelled like spicy cloves. Exactly cloves and deep down powdery. It had such a thick texture and it took some time to squeeze it out of the tube. I have tried only the body oil so this sunscreen was not greasy since I had dry skin. It left a sheen and non greasy though. It smelled like soap after sometimes. But for the price it was okay. Not so great. Good for someone who likes clear sunscreen * I recently tried the Vacation Gelée and I'm thoroughly impressed! This product is a game-changer for anyone looking to elevate their sun care routine. The texture is luxuriously smooth and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling hydrated without any greasy residue. One of the standout features is its deliciously nostalgic scent, reminiscent of a tropical vacation, which makes applying it feel like an indulgence. The formula is lightweight yet effective, offering broad-spectrum protection while keeping my skin moisturized throughout the day. I also love that it gives my skin a subtle, healthy glow without clogging pores or feeling heavy. Whether you're lounging by the pool or just running errands, Vacation Gelée is perfect for keeping your skin protected and radiant. Plus, the packaging is chic and easy to travel with! I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a sun care solution that combines function with a luxurious feel. * This smelled different than most sunscreens I've smelled it almost has a bit of cinnamon smell to me but I love it gives a very moisturizing texture not greasy at all"

It makes applying sunblock so easy and simple. I've been hearing it for years how important it is to use SPF. Especially in skin care. I haven't started doing that until this last couple of years though. Normally in my experience, products that have SPF in it make my skin feel oily or I get a white cast look going on. Sometimes it will be a whole separate product of its own and an extra step in my regimen that sometimes I feel like I don't have time for. This is literally perfect! It has a very light scent kind of like coconut maybe. It is soothing on my skin and the way the mist comes out is perfect. Not too much product, not too heavy, and really easy to use. It is a perfect size. I usually have it right there in my purse so I can reach for it if you need to reapply. I assume it works because I haven't been sunburned being outside for long periods of time. I even use it on my kids! This is a game changer for sunscreen. You can't even tell you're wearing it! * The Super Spritz SPF50 Face Mist by Vacation is such a convenient way to stay protected from the sun. The mist is incredibly fine and lightweight, making it easy to apply without leaving any greasy or heavy residue, even when I use it over makeup. One of my favorite things is how it doesn't disturb my makeup or leave a white cast, which can be an issue with other sunscreens. It feels refreshing when applied, almost like a cooling mist, which is a nice bonus during hot days. The compact packaging makes it easy to carry around and reapply throughout the day, no matter where I am. It's especially handy when I'm outside for long periods or need a quick top-up of SPF. The scent is light and pleasant, not overwhelming at all. I love that it offers strong sun protection without compromising comfort or convenience. It's quickly become a reliable part of my sun care routine, perfect for those days when I want quick, easy protection without any mess. * This face mist felt very lightweight which I was glad about. And the product itself is easy to grab and store in your bag if needed, which is another thing I was happy with. My only issue is the fragrance was almost unbearably strong and didn't have a fragrance that even was enjoyable. * The Vacation Super Spritz SPF 50 Face Mist is a lightweight, refreshing sunscreen spray formulated to provide broad-spectrum sun protection while hydrating and soothing the skin. 

This sunscreen is packed with antioxidant-rich ingredients and doesn't leave a non-greasy finish or any white cast. Definitely avoid spraying on your eyes to avoid any irritation. 

Like its name, the sunscreen truly spritzes out of the spray bottle. I was expecting a fine mist, but no, it's literally a spray. It's fine, but just a heads up. 

The sunscreen is perfumed with Vacation's signature scent: a tropical mix of coconut, banana, and pineapple. Although it is pleasant and reminds me of a summer beach day, it is very strong considering it's meant to be used on the face. 

Overall, the Vacation Super Spritz SPF 50 Face Mist is a convenient sunscreen for reapplication on the go. * As an esthetician for a decade, one of the most important skincare items to me for both personal use and for my clients is a good sunscreen. As a person who could give Snow White a run for ""fairest of them all"" a long lasting and effective SPF prodcut is a constant search. 

Vacation's Super Spritz SPF 50 face mist is one of those skincare gems that both works incredibly well, but smells AMAZING. The mist is lightweight and can be applied over makeup to make that every two hours reapplication much more convenient. The packaging is perfectly sized for on the go, as the product is wonderful for your purse or travel bag. The caffeine in the spray helps to perk up skin, while green tea soothes. The soray is specifically formulated to help sooth and hydrate the skin snd worse against * I'm so impressed with this spray-on sunscreen! The concept is great because it's super easy to use, and I can spray it over my makeup without ruining it. I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin, and this sunscreen is gentle enough not to cause any breakouts. It's been hard to find a sunscreen that works for me, but this one definitely does. It also works perfectly as a base for makeup no separation, and it doesn't mess with the final look. Plus, it smells amazing for a sunscreen! The light scent masks the usual strong sunscreen smell. I've been using it daily and couldn't be happier. I can't wait to take it with me on my next tropical vacation. I'm really impressed with the Vacation brand and can't wait to try more of their wonderful products! * Meet the Super Spritz SPF50 Face Mist by Vacation!

I absolutely love this SPF50 spray sunscreen! This is my first time using a spray sunscreen. The vegan & cruelty free sunscreen dries quickly after spraying on my face. It has a light scent and feels clean and light. The spray is easy to apply and reapply wherever you go. It goes well under makeup and feels instantly fresh and protected as you go about your day. The size is perfect for throwing in my bag so I can take it everywhere. I would recommend this spray to my friends and family."

It pairs well for me while I use tret since it is so hydrating. However, it does sit on the skin as VERY oily. But it doesnt break me out and is light, so I'm leaning towards this being a good product that I will probably rebuy. * Sunscreen works well. It's lightweight and blends easily. Plus it's not greasy which is great. My old facial sunblock would get so greasy when out and about in the sun, this one does not. * Wanted to try it and and its me new fave. * Yes, it really is invisible! I have acne prone skin and it does not break me out. This is my favorite sunscreen to date! This is the first La Roche-Posay product I've used and it's making me want to try more! * Painfully dry lips, swelling in cheeks. Never had a reaction to an SPF quite like this. * I'm not sure if its the ""dewy finish"" or whatever, but this sunscreen is very oily on my skin. It feels like a layer. However it is invisible which is a plus. * I tried this off and on for about a month and i love the texture of it and how it applies and it does hydrate for a little bit but after a few hours my face would be dry. The reason i had to stop using is because it caused skin redness and my skin would appear irritated."

Felt like snookie. * I wanted to love this for the price but I can't stand it. It smells TERRIBLE, every time I wear it it's all I can smell. It haunts me all day. It's also impossible to get off for a sunscreen, requires makeup remover/wipe. You'll also be so greasy. * It has just enough  tint to give you a little  color so if you don't want to wear makeup you do not need to. * This stuff DOES NOT wash off. It requires make up remover. Would NOT buy again. * I was hsing a very pricey primer and found this. I was pleasantly surprised and get compliments on my skin when I wear it. I also combine it with l'oreal's lumi glowtion and it's gorgeous!! * I use a Cetaphil face wash, Cetaphil sunscreen & CeraVe moisturizer that have all been my fave together. I had no idea this product existed and couldn't wait to love it. I'm not sure why ""non-greasy"" and ""non-comedigenic"" are even listed as details because it was the complete opposite. I even made sure to shake the bottle before applying so all ingredients mixed properly. I wore this indoors and looked sweaty all day. I should have removed it sooner because I just knew and felt it would cause a reaction. Sure enough, after showering and getting ready for bed, I had already noticed red bumps/breakouts on my face.
I was lucky to match with the shade of tint, and aside from the cons, it was perfect coverage for me. The color blended so well with me. I wouldn't recommend this for someone who has sensitive skin and I'd also hate for anyone to struggle with the only color they have available. * After developing an allergy to a tinted sunscreen that I had used for many years, I was on the hunt for a suitable replacement. I am so happy with this product! I have fair, combination, sensitive skin. This does not irritate my skin and it blends in well with no white or orange cast."

This feel like you're applying primer, and my fenty powdered foundation looks really great on top of it. My makeup doesn't look muddy after wearing it for a long time either. I'm a 240 in foundation, therefore the white cast isn't awful on me, but I can't speak for darker skin tones. Also it doesn't irritate my eyes like other sunscreens do, and my skin doesn't feel dry despite the desert dry climate * Absolutely love this product. It does exactly what it promised. Super matte finish that is moisturizing and blurs my pores. * I had tried many sunscreen, however I had waste my money as I always return back to Supergoop Matte. Great under makeup. * I have a super shiny, greasy forehead. Always have. This stuff works pretty well for helping it not be. I still have a little shine but it is nothing like before and so I will keep using it unless I find something better. It also doesn't dry out my cheeks or leave white residue, although it can be a little lighter on me. My melasma and sunspots have also cut down so I think it helps. I only put it on in the morning * This sunscreen checked a lot of boxes for me. I knew I wanted to switch to a mineral sunscreen, but was very concerned about it leaving a white cast or being too tinted. I'm very pale and freckled along with some hyperpigmentation in my cheeks. Despite my paleness my other attributes make a white cast very apparent and too intense of a tint can leave me looking jaundiced. This didn't do either! A rare feat. I also have extraordinarily oily skin. While this doesnt leave me matte, it does cut down on some of my shine that is typically increased with sunscreen. I usually just suck it up and accept that my skin is going to be extra shiny. This sunscreen however is a game changer for that. It makes me look the most matte I ever have. The price is my only real con. I do wish it were a bit more affordable. The smell is manageable and I'd rather its current scent than an added fragrance. * If you put any more than a quarter amount of product, you'll have the biggest white cast ever. I'm mixed and on the darker side, and it was absolutely terrible. I had to wash my face before leaving for a concert. Literally looked liked i put a light matte foundation all over my face. 0/5 * Like a primer …but sunscreen—"

It does melt into the skin but I catch my skin or the lotion peeling some after a few hours. * This is not a matte product so if you want zero shine you need to seek out a silicone based sunscreen. 

No stinging at all, no burning. No uncomfortable textures. Not too thick, not too thin.

Personally, I have dry skin and this helped a lot. My skin felt moisturized and retained moisture better after a couple of uses. 

Just like other moisturising sunscreen products, if you are gonna wear this under makeup you need to let it absorb for probably about an hour if you want it to play well, and you'll need to make sure you are using products that work well together (ex. not silicone based primer). 

I used this on just my face for about 6 months and then alternated it with another sunscreen seasonally, it lasted me about a year and a half. 

Love it, Highly recommend. * It work well without any moisturizer but if i use moisturizer before it, it peels on my face. * it shouldn't have made me break out so bad. Pukesgiving! * Our family of 7 went to the beach and I bought two tubes of this product. Five of us used this. Two used another brand I had. Within an hour the five of us that used this had burned backs, despite not getting in water yet.   The other two were fine. Also, once in water,  eyes started burning, this stuff is not waterproof. * This sunscreen was ineffective in the sun. I applied it twice during my beach trip and it left my face burnt and with a ton of zits. If you have acne prone skin I do not recommend. In addition if you plan on using for a beach/pool day I don't recommend as it doesn't provide coverage. * Terrible, would not soak in, even when applied 30+ minutes before leaving the house in AC.  Product would slip and create white streaks the moment I started sweating.  Stung my eyes since it doesn't soak in, also caused breakouts"

I would recommend this product. * I liked the color of this tinted sunscreen, but not the amount of glitter. * Shimmer? More like TONS of glitter! Glitter all over my hands and clothes! I'd rather pay extra for the Supergoop and not have a glittery mess everywhere. * I love this product but the fact that there are hormone disruptive ingredients really scared me and should not be a part of the product * It looks super beautiful and glowy at first but then it starts pilling really bad.

It's rather expensive though for what you get- considering it's a body sunscreen, this wouldn't even get you through a week at the beach. * No matter which supergoop I try they are heavy greasy they do block the sun but feel horrible * Me gusta mucho, no deja la piel grasosa, te da brillo y protege * Absolutely terrible! I broke out in a rash about an hour after using. Theew it away immediately! * I love the OG unseen sunscreen for my face and its the perfect texture and viscosity. I was hoping this would be too. I hate the lotion texture of others so i was really excited that SG came out witb this. The only problem is that its just oily… it absorbs well and makes my skin feel REALLY SOFT but since i do sweat pretty easily it can feel a bit slick at times. Maybe its the olive oil in it? Or its just too many oils. * Goes on like silk and absorbs quickly. * This is a unique sunscreen. It slides onto my skin without an oily feel and immediately disappears like water. I like working in the yard. The Unseen Sunscreen Body enables me to be outside without getting a tan or sunburn in this hot summer sun. Other brands of sunscreen have felt oily and were a bit difficult to apply without some effort. The Supergoop! spread easily. It was a delightful surprise!"

All the ingredients are clean and moisturizing, but not sticky. * My bumps on my chest came overnight . Theyre not normal, it will take MONTHS to get rid of these hard crators ! :( * Both of the face products apply wonderfully and work well under makeup. I have been looking for sunscreen with glitter and the stick gives a subtle sparkle without looking like you got attacked by a child's craft project. The price is also great - you get enough product to try before you decide if you want a full size. * yeah I had high hopes for this because it looks so pretty and shimmery in the ads but it straight up doesn't work. I was reapplying it every 30 minutes and I burned SO SO bad. very sad :( * This kit is a home run.  #1 Love the Sun Shield in a new travel friendly size.  The stick is BOMB!  I wouldn't necessarily describe it as glittery at all.  It's more of a sun-kissed glisten effect.  Soft Shield is my new fave primer. 💕❤️⛱️ Kopari"

I have been using it for a few months now and I just cant make it work. No matter how much I simplify my skincare routine, it pills. I know that tends to happen when products are not compatible with one another but no matter what I do it continues to pill. Im glad others have had so much success with it but I can't say the same. * I've been using Australian Gold's tinted matte SPF50 but haven't been able to find it recently. Got this with my rewards and LOVE it! Pleasant fragrance. Goes on easily and clear. It's certainly not matte, but I just put some powder on over it. * I was struggling to find a sunscreen that would play nice and wear well under my make up. I picked this up hoping the skincare infused formula would work. And boy oh boy, does it ever. This preps my skin so nicely every morning. It goes on easily and evenly and does not have a strong sunscreen sent. Those with oily skin may not like this but if you have normal to dry skin, you have got to try this product. 1000% recommend * I didn't like it and returned it. It's not for oily skin . It made me super shiny and it felt sticky. * Bought this for recent trip to Gulf Shores.  Pros: absorbs quickly, no white residue, nongreasy.  Cons: provided virtually zero sun protection.  My face got fried.  Went back to my 30 SPF Clinique which provided much better protection and no burn. * This sunscreen replaced all of my morning skincare. I just put this on and go about my day!

I kept his skin protected and he didn't mind reapplying thought out the beach day. * Absolutely love this product! I wanted a clear sunscreen for my face and the product i was using was always out of stock so i bought this based on someone's review here showing how she used the stick on her shoulder and showed where she burned and didn't. It's perfect to stash in your purse, a little goes a long way, easy to apply. I will say it has a very minimal fragrance but it practically goes away as soon as you swipe it and ive had no reactions whatsoever. My new favorite! * This stick sunscreen is the best one out. I never get burned when i use this. * I travel for work and this is perfect to have on the road. Effective, no odor, smooth and non greasy * Bought this based off of the reviews here and I am so glad I did. I was looking for a sunscreen specifically for face. This was exactly what i was looking for. It's clear, not sticky, glides on smoothly, conveniently sized. I need something to quickly put on before running out the door and this makes it easy to apply all over the face and neck area. I havent used this under makeuo yet but i am sure it wouldnt be an issue since there is no residue it leaves on the skin, it is truly smooth and feels like nothing is on. The only possible con for some might be that there is a slight fragrance. It is a VERY subtle fragrance, it reminds me of Softsoap handsoap, but it does not linger by any means. It's more like once you apply it its there but vanishes within a min maybe less? It didnt cause any irritation whatsoever. * I bought this to take on a trip and i could definitely see the difference between spots that I used the stick vs missed spots. Doesn't feel greasy and I love how easy it is to carry in my purse so I can reapply more frequently. * Bought this to try a stick cause since typical cream sunscreen always ends up in my eye I sweat and causes my eyes to sting. Used it for the first time on a lake day and only applied once - my face and neck were the only two body parts that left without sunburn. It's now my go to for everyday use, glides on super smooty, doesnt leave a film, and doesnt feel heavy on your face. Okay Im done rambling now, just go buy it."

I feel it lacks coverage. I am not one to burn easily either. Quite disappointed. * I used this is past with no problems.  I started having some serious skin issues on my face, neck, and tops of ears- swelling, flaking, peeling, splitting, etc. Eventually ended up at an allergist getting extensive patch testing. Of the products I used that I took in for the testing (in addition to the premade allergen patches), this caused an allergic reaction and a JVN shampoo (that had been reformulated before i bought that bottle) caused a reaction.  Another mineral sunscreen did not. * My skin loves this sunscreen but it pills horribly. Ive bought several and all of them pill. If they can fix this issue then it would be worth the money in my opinion. * I started using this on friday. By sunday my skin was a little raw but I wondered if I'd just been too rough with it. By monday morning my skin was covered in a red, raw, itchy, painful rash. Feels like a super itchy chemical burn. I thought I was going crazy. Its the only thing i changed in my very gentle routine though. So I looked it up and lo and behold I'm not the only one this happened to. All these photos of people with identical issues from this product in the reviews. Needless to say this went straight into the trash.

I bought the travel size since I was going on vacation and only bringing a carry on and the regular size would be too big. I was a tad disappointed that these did not last the entire week. My husband and I were the only ones using the spray and we brought 2 new travel bottles with us, but they only made it to about 2/3 of the vacation. It would be nice if there was a TSA approved size that could go a little further. Besides that though, it had a good application that lasted well and as always, I love the scent. * Its an anazing product. Snells anazing, and definitely fets the job done. My only negative is that its a chemical sunscreen. Great for occational use, but not a daily summer sunscreen bc of that. * My husband and I had the worst experience with this product today, so I ran to the reviews to see if others had a problem with it. Sure enough, others mentioned that they burned badly & quickly when using this product. We spent 1 hour in overcast weather, me wearing a long sleeve hoodie, before the sun came out and we decided to wear our T shirts and SPF. We were super confused when very shortly afterwards, we were BURNED!! This wasn't the most intense sun either. I tried to protect myself & my husband with this product and it caused more harm than good. 0/10, don't even risk it. * I used this sunscreen at the beach and didnt get sunburnt at all! I have very sensitive skin and burn very badly. It was easy to apply, not greasy, and fragrance free. My only reason for giving 4 stars is the price and if you go in the water it'll wash off immediately. But I would still buy it again for another beach trip! * The smell was so strong. It smelled extremely fake, like a chemical. I couldn't try it in the store, so I tried it when I got home and returned it the next day. 
It is not something to buy because it is easy to apply. * I just bought a bottle one month ago and it's empty. I dont over spray and maybe use it every weekend. it costs to mucj to go through it so fast."

It smells great and adds a pretty shimmer to the skin but it doesnt work as sun protection even though it markets 45spf. I applied this 4 tomes in 4 hours while at the pool and still burned. The spf is super misleading. Peotect your skin and dont use this as spf. * Love this spf, it smells so good and it is very easy to apply! * This product's ingredients seperated way before expiration says expires 11/2025 and I never opened this and saw the top half all oil and the bottom all that rose pink color. No matter how much i shook it it would not mix back together. * This sunscreen leaves the most beautiful glowy finish and smells SO good! I love using this whenever I'm on vacation since it doesn't feel like sunscreen and look so amazing on the skin while still protecting with SPF!"

It burns for a while too. As soon as you use a towel/rag to soothe your eyes a minute later they'll start burning again. This can happen for hours. Wanted to love this because it doesn't leave a white cast if you rub it in enough, but the eye burning isn't worth that. * i bought this in store at the beginning of summer after an employee recommended it to me. i'm a natural redhead, so im pretty pasty and prone to skin cancer/burning easy. i was hesitant because it was super pricy - but a little goes a long way!!! i work outside in the sun all day and have every day for the summer, and i havent burnt ONCE since buying and actively using this. i still have over half the bottle after 2/3 months. it is so worth the money. * I really wanted to like this BUT I've used it a few times and for some reason, after about an hour, even though I'm not sweating, this sunscreen starts to get in my eyes and even my mouth! Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation. It has Benzophenone in it, which can cause contact  dermatitis. I get an allergic reaction on my eyelids every time I've used this product. * OMG this is the best sunscreen I've found for my skin, it's refreshing and soft and doesn't leave your skin white or thought of it. I loved it * Goes on white but leaves no white cast on brown skin after rubbing it in. I love how the spray disperses the product evenly. I dont recommend using it on your face directly though. Steep price for an average sunscreen. * This sunscreen is great. I have very oily acne prone skin and this rubs in well and does not make me greasy at all unlike other sunscreens."

I use everyday . no white cast, and a little goes a long away * This sunscreen works like a face moisturizer and works very well under makeup. I was looking for a sunscreen/moisturizer that wouldn't pill underneath my makeup and this one is perfect. * I love this sunscreen, it has been my everyday sunscreen for over a year now. No caste after applying, and does not peel. Leaves my face so soft and bright. 100% recomend. * After receiving this in a sample pack, I liked how light and smooth it glided on my skin.  It actually felt like whipped cream.  I went back and bought a full-size tube.  

Although it was the same product, over time my skin started to break out.  I tested it by going with and without.  After applying to freshly clean face, as I always do, I would start breaking out as the day went on.  Gonna have to switch up. Bummer. * super lightweight & blends in effortlessly. 0 white cast & works perfectly under makeup! * Yall cannot use this as body sunscreen thats a huge waste of money anyway. Just use sun bum for your body lol
This stuff is ANAZING for the face, many days at the river last summer and no burnt cheeks for me 🙏 its super lightweight which i appreciate since i get plenty greasy on my own during the hotter months.
Not to mention its water resistant and reef safe, two very important things for me in a sunscreen. * First off, in allergic to coconut oil so its hard for ke to fond sunscreens that work for me. This one is PERFECT!!! It doesn't feel like sunscreen and it blends into my skin beautifully. Definitely worth trying!!"

Wears great under makeup. Really good sunscreen! * The packaging is what got me about this product. I am a sucker for vintage packaging, so while I love that, I do not like this sunscreen. The smell makes me gag, it's too oily, and I look like a ghost while applying this. * don't love the smell so star is removed, but this incorporates very well with my moisturizer due to its consistency. I highly recommend for fairer sensitive skin tones, it finishes a little white so that is icky and dumb, but it works for me. * I have been loving this new mineral milk sunscreen. It has a lightweight texture that melts into my skin and leaves it glowing. It has that signature vacation smell too, of course. I definitely recommend it! The packaging is also so cute and easy to use. * Bought this on a whim after reading the reviews and this sunscreen has turned into my daily driver. Im at a point in my life where sunscreen is a necessity to stop the signs of aging and make sure my skincare is doing its job, but I dread applying it because it either feels suffocating or doesnt lay well at all under makeup. I am super picky, have literally tried them all and there is nothing i hate more than sunscreen that feels oily or sticky on my face all day. This is the best texture, not oily on my combo skin, doesnt pill under makeup, doesnt sting my eyes, and it does go on white but truly disappears on my skin after rubbing it in. Not to mention the packaging is so cute! I am fair to light/medium complexion depending on the time of year. If you are a darker complexion your mileage may vary. * Unfortunately alot of these reviews were part of a promotional offer and are inaccurate. Sunscreen is apart of my daily routine, and I frequently wear mineral sunscreen on my face. This is an oily mess, i love vacation but this is a miss. I am very fair skinned and it left a white cast on me."

But I am utterly disappointed. It caused severe eye irritation that i had to go see an ophthalmologist. No sunscreen has caused me such reaction so i was worreid. However i do think it's a good moistirozer with SPF but its just not for me. * This moisturizer initially feels amazing on the skin, and it worked well under my makeup. However, after a few hours, my eyes began to burn and sting! It happened on 2 separate days so i know that it is this moisturizer. Again, i really wanted to like this but it really irritates my eyes. * This is a really great SPF moisturizer. It really holds up to its name. I've been looking at this brand for months and finally got it. I've only been using this for a little under a week but this by far, has been the best SPF moisturizer I've EVER used. Someone who works at Ulta said this was a really great product; she was correct. What sold me is when she said it holds up really well for people who have oily skin, which is an issue for me so I have an issue with products that make my skin extra oily. This is very lightweight and worth the money. I just need to see how this holds up with this FL heat. * I thought this was the perfrct match for me as i am lazy and hate having to layer moisturizer with an SPF and get greasy quick. This dries down matte at first but within an hour or so is super greasy and makes my face very shiny. For the price I expected better. * I tend to find most sunscreens to be greasy, oily, or sticky even when they claim otherwise. I assumed this would be the same especially since its a sunscreen moisturizer combo. However I was wrong!  The texture and finish is so so lovely. It's very lightweight and glides on nicely, moisturizes without leaving me feeling like a shiny greasy mess! It's perfect under make too. Highly recommend! * It is weightless but it burns yours eyes terribly when you go to take it off ...and it's not sweat proof...for the almost $50 this is I expect more out of a spf moisturizer. There are drugstore brands that can offer the same for a way less price point. Definitely returning. * For some reason, every other facial sunscreen I've tried either made my face red and hot, had a sticky texture, or made my skin bumpy and textured afterwards. This is the only sunscreen without any of these issues! It feels like a regular, lightweight moisturizer in every way, and washes off easily without any texture or stickiness."

Im yet to try Maui Babe, but from what I have came across this is a great tanning oil im just not sure if its the best considering the price. * Love this product. Works very well. Good for fair skin or skin that burns easily. * Love this oil!! It created an even tan while moisturizing my skin beautiful. In love with the smell. 

Cons- not water proof and cap cracked and disintegrated with the heat and oil. * The packaging is beautiful but it's glass and that is kind of pain to handle. It's VERY VERY oily. It's a slick oil like the Hawaiian Tropic oil. So you cannot touch anything or sit on anything besides a towel once applied. Have only tried it once and it maybe gave a color boost but nothing too crazy. Would probably love it if it were more of dry oil. It's a little pricey for just a tanning oil with an SPF. Many other products out there that do that same for less money and more ideal packaging."

It smells like sunless tanner i checked like 3 times because i was like why do i smell like that…. And it definitely stains anything it touched like who thought thisnproduct was a good idea … ruins the whole brand name * I cannot recommend this browning lotion with SPF as it stains everything with which it comes into contact. I have used another browning lotion that left a temporary stain, but I could not get my towel, bikini, or bag clean after using this one. (The straps of my bag and the areas where it touched my body and arm are now forever stained.) I didn't think this one was going to make a mess since it actually sort of dries down on the skin. I was very wrong. It left an enormous mess everywhere. I do not recommend you use this unless you are wearing brown or black and you use a brown or black towel and bag. Just don't buy it. * There is a lot to be desired when it comes to this product. It has a very liquidy consistency and does not spread evenely, and then it will stain anything it comes in contact with. On top of that, I developed an awful case of hives across my body. Usually I love vacation products, but this one was not it. * Don't let the marketing fool you! This may give you a nice glow, after you use enough to not streak bc it does not spread easily, but it will ruin everything it touches. It will stain all cloths it comes in contact with and will not wash out. Save your money, its a horrible product! * I had high hopes because I love Vacation products. This lotion, while it adds a nice color to your skin, is horrible in every other aspect. It bleeds all over any fabric it touches, is not waterproof and; therefore, even sweating causes it streak and stain anything it touches. Would give zero stars if possible! * This will stain your clothes. This will stain anything you touch. Don't sweat. Don't go in the water. It doesn't go on evenly, and it doesn't stay on at all. This product is garbage. Maybe someone who is tanner than I am might like this product because it is sunscreen that doesn't leave a white cast. I don't understand the positive reviews. * This stuff does not blend well at all. Does not go on even. Its is extrnsly messy and transfers to everything and does not come out of clothes/linens. It also has a strong unpleasant smell. Would not recommend."

Smells nice but can't smell unless I put my hands to my nose and I prefer it that way.  Have bought Sun Bum spf lip balm in the past and always loved it,now I can add their spf body lotion to my favorite list of products. * I use this product every single day. I've bought at least 5 bottles this summer. Its a true holy grail. Its not sticky. It never ever pills. I love how smooth,soft and well protected it makes my skin feel. Very comfortable. It leaves begind a soft,dewy sheen. I have not burned once while wearing it. It's excellent for use anytime you're not in/by the water. (You could, but I would use traditional sunscreen for that.) It smells amazing as all Sunbum products do. That fades rather quickly so it doesn't interfere with perfume. I do wish this product were available in a larger size,but at least it's in a pump. * I have sensory issues that make me more sensitive to how products feel on my skin. The vast majority of sunscreens feel sticky or greasy in some way, but I push through those feelings because wearing sunscreen is extremely important. Enter this sunscreen. SPF50, pleasant to apply, and NOT GREASY AT ALL! I would love if this formula came in different sizes so I can travel with it. Sun Bum nailed it with this one! * I am super surprised that this lotion is as good as it is. Im really picky about my choice of sunscreen, well let me tell you this is a high quality moisturizer for me and I've been using it each morning! My skin feels great and it protects me, I haven't been sunburned since using it. I reapply if I'm outside working and sweating, so make sure to do that! Yes I recommend, I'm already ordering a 2nd bottle, you get a lot of product for a low price compared to others on the market. This works as well as, or better than prestige brands, IMO. Its non greasy and actually moisturizing too! Really happy i took a chance on this one. I live in Southern California and the sun is always out, so wearing sunscreen is not an option! * Love the scent and how easily it applies (like any typical lotion).  The pump is amazing - loved it for putting lotion on me and the kids before we left the house.  Everyone would comment on the wonderful beachy scent (banana/coconut). * I love this sunscreen! It's not too greasy, easy to apply, and protected me from sunburns. Smells amazing too, just like summer. * While this absorbs super fast and is very lightweight, after being outside for an hour and a half, I still burned. I use the regular SPF70 all the time and swear by it but I won't be using this particular product again. I think it's great as an everyday moisturizer with minimal sun exposure but if you are spending any length of time outside, use the regular sunscreen. Don't be a tomato like me"

I have combination skin and found myself disliking the sticky, heavy feeling. * The setting mist bottle does not spray. It is 30 minutes to my nearest Ulta store to return. Frustrating purchase! * I live on an island and absolutely don't leave the house without sunscreen, but I've never found a product that I loved for my face until now. I have combination skin and Unseen Sunscreen has become my new daily. It is smooth as silk and feels identical to Smashbox primer, if you've tried that. It absorbs almost immediately but leaves my skin soft and ready for makeup, but I think it blurs well enough that l dont need makeup (I'm in my 40's). This little sample tube has lasted me two weeks of daily use and it's finally running low. I use an amount the size of my index nail and it's enough for my face, neck, and the backs of my hands. I read some reviews questioning the SPF value, but they seemed unfounded and I wonder if those reviewers were using authentic product. 

Yesterday I went out boating for four hours and I relied only on this little kit. The Refresh spray was nice for reapplication, which I only remembered once, halfway through the day. I didn't get burned at all, even under these harshest conditions. 

The Play Everyday lotion was fine. It worked well and I definitely would have burned without it, as I missed a few spots and am absolutely fried. It just doesn't stand out above other sunblocks to me. 

Nonetheless, I'm very happy that I ordered this kit. These aren't cheap products but the quality is excellent and I don't skimp on skincare. This kit allows you to try each and see how your skin responds before investing in larger sizes. * These are so small they should be free samples. I haven't even used them yet, but I should have looked more closely at the size before ordering. The price is way too high for these tiny bottles. You will basically get one or two applications with each. * I have bought this twice and it is such good value and it lasts a while. * I love this product but the bag (a big asset on why I bought this set) is an ok sized bag that feels cardboardy. The sizes of the products are pretty reasonable. The ""Unseen Sunscreen"" is very soft and silky. None of the products leave my skin with white cast or oil and grease. My skin feels amazing after using this product. I would recommend this set or even the full size of all these products. Over I would recommend this! * Cheap way to try 3 sunscreens! Loved both the lotions but wasn't a big fan of the spray. It felt greasy."

Would not recommend. * ugggh i wanted to love this so badly but if it even gets near your eyes it feels AWFUL. had to return :( * It could be my combination skin that is over 30yo but it basically ruins my makeup. It gives an oily/greasy look and kind of separates the makeup, making my skin look extra textured. Plus the spray comes out in more of a stream spray than a mist * I was so excited for this and wanted to like it but after using it, throughout the day it gets into your eyes and stings so bad.

This is the case with any Sun Bum product (for me anyways); sensitive skin around my eyes, nose and lips would burn HORRIBLY. If you're sensitive to achohol and fragrance STEER CLEAR of this product. * My best friend sprayed me (whole body! Not just my face!) with this at an outdoor festival and I was in love. It smells like bubblegum to me ans mists smoothly. I use it as a travel sized spray sunscreen for everywhere. I have very sensitive skin (everywhere) and feel like this didnt break me out. * I was excited to find a ""face mist"" that i could spray directly onto my face. Alas, you shouldnt do that with this product. It also irritated my eyes after I got wet in the pool. * This reeks of rubbing alcohol and is one of the main ingredients. Returned. * Will burn the crap out of your eyes! Soooo swollen and burning all day * Been using this for a couple months on pool days and on a vacation to Cabo. I love this because it is a mist that can go on over your makeup and places like hairline where other sunscreen forms arent ideal.

The scent isnt horrible. The only thing i dont love is how my scalp feels when i put it on. Kinda like hairspray but tacky too. Overall i would recommend this product. I have bought multiple times & made some family buy too! * Love this product.  Reliably keeps my scalp from burning with just a few well-placed spritzes.  Herbal smell dissipates quickly, and I'm careful to avoid spraying too much so I don't get greasy hair.  Also works as a quick SPF spray on neck/shoulders in a pinch. * The actual SPF in this product works well for my hair and scalp, but tell me how is this a sunscreen bottle and the paint on it MELTS when it's in a bag that's hardly even in direct sunlight. The bottle constantly leaks as well, and the scent can be nauseating, especially when it spilled all over other stuff in my bag. * I have androgenic alopecia and Tellugen effluvium. I do not always want to wear a hat/scarf/wig,especially while swimming. I definitely no longer wear swim caps as they are too hard on my delicate hair. This product protects my scalp under some very thin patches. It smells amazing. Herbal but fresh as well. The scent dissipates rather quickly. The mist is a pump and it is very fine and consistent. if you are careful with placement and apply evenly it will not become greasy. My hair is very thin,if it's greasy you are using too much and you are spraying on the hair not the scalp. Maybe get someone to help with application if this is happening. Anyway, my scalp has not burned all summer and I have started using it on my whole family. It's pricey,yeah,Coola isnt cheap,but it's a very high quality/performance product line. I will repurchase this and the spf setting spray for a long time to come. * I am so disappointed in the product. It turned my bleach blonde hair so brassy!! Blondes beware!

My skin looked so dewy and glowly. Its gave me a beautiful sun kissed glow. It applies smoothly to the skin and it is not patchy. It looks very luminous. I like how it has SPF 30 so it protects my skin from the sun. It contains coconut oil, jojoba oil, marula oil, and argan oil. The scent is very warm like coconut and pineapple. It is their signature scent in all of their sunscreen products. The scent remind me of a summer day on the beach. The product is like liquid gold. It has hints of shimmer and glitter which looks stunning on the body. The product is not greasy at all and feels comfortable on my skin. I love it and would recommend it. ""This review was collected as part of a promotion"" * like this product. It has a nice smell and pretty shimmer. I wish it gave more of an oily glow and lasted longer. I like that this has spf and isn't greasy. I wasn't worried about this staining my clothes because it dry down well. The packaging is nice and looks like an expensive perfume which is very nice for sitting on the vanity.

Product layers well with other fragrance and fragrance oil and on top of itself. I think this will definitely last for a while and compared to the price I would say it's worth it. Really great beach product or added touch to an outfit. Definitely a summer time staple and the product being a 2n1 is really appealing. I like vacation brand and I think they super innovative and this product is just another example of their great brand. * I love this highlight oil! Is stays shiny for a very long time.

My name is Lacey, I'm a licensed cosmetologist of 18 years, and I have a serious obsession with beauty products of all kinds. Reviews are always the first place I go before buying a new product, and I'm here to share mine. As we know, SPF is the most important and most popular additive when it comes to our skincare products. Over the summer, I was lucky enough to test Vacation's shimmer oil with SPF 30, and it had me feeling and looking like a golden goddess.
Usually, applying SPF is a painful experience for me. I don't like it! Vacation took away that pain with this luxurious oil-based shimmering sunscreen. Made with coconut, jojoba, marula, and argan oils, its scent smells amazing without being too overpowering. Jojoba oil is my favorite ingredient here, and I use it often for its beneficial properties. It contains vitamin E that can do everything from boosting collagen, helping to diminish fine lines and wrinkles, while also improving your skin's elasticity and providing extra hydration. 
This product glides on your skin so silky and smoothly, without feeling super greasy or looking greasy. It spreads evenly, and a little really goes a long way. This oil feels like it actually penetrates your skin, giving you added moisturizing properties that other SPF oils do not offer.
Now the best part - the shimmer! Not too much, not too little. The tiny gold specks sparkle beautifully in the sunshine without overdoing it. I received so many compliments at the pool - noticing the shimmer and the scent. Sexiest legs ever. Overall, it's truly a beach girl's dream product.
Vacation shimmer oil makes applying sunscreen actually enjoyable. It's obvious that Vacation puts so much thought into their products to really make them stand out from the ordinary. For example, the little ball they put in the bottle to make sure that it's mixed properly before application- to evenly distribute that glittery glow. I really appreciate that little ball!
If you enjoy tanning and laying out, you need to have this product in your beach bag. Without a doubt, I'm giving Vacation Shimmer Oil a 5-star rating and I highly recommend it to all my fellow beach bums out there. 
Just get it. I'm confident you'll be thanking me when you do. There's nothing not to love about it. * My name is Jessica & I'm a 37 year old avid beauty enthusiast. The Vacation Shimmer Oil is THE LOOK of Spring & Summer & will keep you shining when the sun goes down in the Fall & Winter! The product packaging is super lux. I absolutely love the rippled cap and the fact that it's in a clear bottle which showcases you the beauty of the actual product. Both the bottle & product gives you that Bahamas vacay feeling all 4 seasons!  I like to glow all year round and this is now my holy grail. It makes my skin feel buttery soft and it gives me that perfect sparkle. It's water resistant for 80 minutes & 30SPF which to me is mind blowing after growing up in the 90s baby oil craze. It also blends seamlessly and doesn't leave a white cast like most sunscreens do. It leaves my skin with this gorgeous golden color. It smells of coconut & banana, mixed with a little pool water. The smell is absolutely divine. I mean what a dream.. vacation!! * The Vacation Shimmer Oil is THE LOOK of Spring & Summer & will keep you shining when the sun goes down in the Fall & Winter!

It's subtle enough for everyday wear but still noticeable enough to make your skin look luminous and healthy in the sun."

It worked fine as a lightweight summer moisturizer and under makeup. Unfortunately it broke me out every time I wore it. * I wanted to like this product as a mineral sunscreen - it applies nicely. However it left a white cast on my medium brown skin, and broke me out. Id stop using this and my skin would go back to normal, id try this again and breakout with no other changes to my routine. If youre prone to breakouts, this might not be the right product. * I did not like this at all- it felt like it created a sticky layer that never really absorbed into my skin. Maybe this would work if you had very dry skin but I am using this up on my hands. * It worker fine as a multi use. I didnt have any white cast which was great. I wanted to use this to cut down on having multiple products, especially under makeup and in the summer. It works okay as a moisturizer/primer (not mositurizing enough for me), and didnt notice any issues as a sunscreen. However, while I like the slight tint, I noticed this glittery sheen that makes it look cheap? Got this on sale so I'll finish the tube but it's not what I firsy reach for and I will not repurchase. * You were out of what I like so your associate recommended this. Don't like it. * I tried so hard to love this, but it broke me out and left me with white-heads every time I used it. It also felt tight and drying on my already dry skin. But, it didn't leave a white cast (though I'm pale) and sat great under makeup. * This is one of the only sunscreens I could find without any potential pore cloggers, but unfortunately it dried out my skin so badly :("

No white cast and light weight. I had my boyfriend try it and he loves it too. This is the only sunscreen for my house. Please never change this formula. * Bought the porduct for my boyfriend as he works outside and he put it on 30 minutes before his shift and his eye began to itch then noticed his eyes were almsot swollen shut. * I've been using this for YEARSSSS and I love it. It is very hydrating and it doesn't give a white cast when you put it in your face, and as a black woman, that is very important to me * I love this sunscreen so much. I use to not wear sunscreen becsude I always had a hard time finding one that didn't leave a white cast. This sunscreen does not leave me with a white cast. It feels like nothing is on my skin. I highly recommend this sunscreen. * this is the only sunscreen that doesn't break me out, and it feels like skincare!

Unfortunately this isnt it. The product dries after less than 30 min. Which i could live with if it didnt smell like an overpowering sweet vanilla cupcake. The smell is so strong i cant bring myself to wear it. If they could reformulate that, its okay to use. Just know it doesnt stay glossy it would be more like a chapstick in terms of how it feels on the lips. * This tasted really good, but it didn't help protect my lips.  They were more chapped than before I used the product. * I love the formula and the scent! But ive had it maybe two months and the lid cracked and leaked everywhere 😭 * Smells/tastes like buttery vanilla or marshmallow to me, not sure where people are getting feet from LOL. However while i dont think it smells bad it is quite overpowering. 
My main issue was the formula is WAY too loose/watery! It slides off my lips almost immediately, no matter how much or little i apply. I know it's a ""lip oil"", but it feels like literal canola oil on my lips lol! For the price point, I was hoping it would feel more like a gloss. Super disappointing. I'm starting to think this brand's strong suit is its packaging/marketing lol… * I love the smell and the look of this product on my lips and the fact theres SPF in it!"

I now look like a tomato and have sun poisoning. Don't waste your money * I used this sunscreen recently at an amusement park and it was 90s the whole time. Good news is that I didn't get burnt but I felt sticky the whole day. It was pretty uncomfortable. I would buy again if there was a dry touch option. * Unfortuately this product pilled a lot and was not sweat resitant for me. Dissappinted :( * As a ginger, sunscreen is very important to me. After using a bunch of different spf 50s on my trip, this has stayed #1! The smell is amazing, the spray is very powerful and only needs a little bit since it goes such a long way, and it leaves a nice glow without too much oil! I heavily recommend this spf! * perfect sunscreen for wandering the city, hiking, just sitting outside, not greasy which is so major, smells unique in a good way * DON'T BUY!! Does NOT work!!!! Went camping and had the family use this spf and we all ended up burnt! I take sunscreen very seriously and this the first time with any that hasn't worked! Not worth it!! * I don't know what was in this sunscreen, but I was really looking forward to a convenient spray SPF. I put it on my forearms and neck in late morning and was put off by the scent, but brushed it off. Later that night, I noticed small, red pinpricks all over my arms. I woke up the next morning and the dots had become red bumps, and were noticeable over my neck, looking similar to acne. As of now, about 36 hours later, my arms are still covered in bumps, though they are no longer red. I have no known allergies, so I don't know what caused this reaction. All this to say, I have not enjoyed this experience, and the scent is unpleasant anyways."

Cons: That price tho. * I love this product. It feels like I'm putting nothing onto my face, yet still getting the needed coverage, which is the only way I want to feel about sunscreen and makeup; natural. 

The only downside to this product is that it notes a necessary re-application every 40 minutes if swimming or sweating. The swimming part I don't care about, but I'm an oily gal in the summertime. That's a lot of re-applicating, especially considering the amount you're getting for the price. Just some food for thought. * Love using this sunscreen * I repurchased this sunscreen when it was part of Ulta's Beauty Steals. I love this sunscreen as it's easy to wear, doesn't leave a white cast on my skin, and doesn't cause breakouts. I gave it four stars because at the regular price, I would try to find a cheaper alternative. * I bought this by accident, thinking I was getting the tinted version which I love. When I opened it and saw it was the Unseen version, I thought I'd try it. I really like it! Even when I use tinted Supergoop! on my face, I use this for my neck, décolleté, and hands. When I choose to use this on my face, it goes on smoothly, feels much like a primer, and works great with makeup. It's a keeper for me! * A family member loves the sunscreen, so I am always buying it for them. For me it can pill  time to time. 

However, I do like the texture of this. No white  cast. 
If you don't have acne prone skin, then this is a good option * This product goes on so silky and smooth. Love it. Does the job."

You will look like you are greasy. Too expensive to be so bad. * if you want to go to the URGENT CARE wear this product... I got this product from a friend and she said it broke her out. I thought I didn't have sensitive skin in the slightest. I put this product on for a baseball game I went to, I wake up the next day and I have redness and texture around my mouth area. I thought it was just a little breakout that would go away withen a week.... NOPE! I wake up the next day and the previous redness and texture I had got worse and it have moved across my cheeks. It continued like this until it plagued my entire face. I looked like a ballon, it was so bad. I decided that I really needed to go to urgent care to do something about this because it was hot, painful, and so uncomfortable.... I COULD BARLEY OPEN MY EYES!!!! When they finally got to me in the urgent care (2 hours later) we traced my reaction back to the sunscreen I used, I have to get shots and medicine to cure this reaction. Please do your reasearch on whats in this product. * I have had this for just a few days and really like it so far! It's easy for me to apply sunscreen in the morning without getting my hands all gross. The only downside is depending on how much you put on, it takes a while to absorb in your skin/dry. * This product did protect my face from the sun, but hours after I was in the pool it was still greasy! I had to buy a travel bottle of cetaphil cleanser to wash it off! I usually use the sun bum stick, but wanted to try this item after seeing a celebrity going a GRWM video and saw them use this sunscreen! * Its not greasy and very glowy. It doesnt break me out and the stick is very convenient and leaves the skin feeling silky. * Love this product. Easy to use. Really protected my face did not burn. Would recommend this p to my friends. * I have dry skin and most of the products are absorbed, but this sunscreen doesn't absorb into your skin and it looks very very oily as if you're sweating or something. I guess you can use this for your cheeks as a highlighter or something but def not for full face. I just love that it has no white. I'll try unscreen next."

This is the only spf that has not aggravated my perioral dermatitis. Other spfs would cause redness, burning, and peeling, but not this one! Im fairly light and i do notice the white cast others mention but it blends in well in less than a minute. Highly recommend for sensitive skin! * Was hoping to love this product. The consistancy is nice, I like how it spreads on my skin. Does leave a bit of a white cast but it smells really bad, like smelly feet. I cannot tolerate the smell. * I really love this product! Its perfect except for one thing, which is why it gets 4/5 stars. 

Pros:
- Non-comedogenic, safe for acne prome skin!! (My skin is super sensy)
- great under water based makeup (no pilling)
- great SPF, does its job
- even application 
- would and will continue to use/buy

Cons:
- it smells super funky * I tried this out when I couldn't find the K-beauty sunscreen I usually use. This just was not for me, it has a really sticky texture and takes a really long time to dry down if it dries down at all. I think it made me break out, it's also not sweat proof or waterproof. If you're looking for something that dries down matte, this is definitely not it. * this would be my favorite sunscreen but my goodness it smells so bad! * I bought this because I was looking for an affordable mineral sunscreen. The smell is horrendous. It goes away after a while, but I can't stand applying it. It also is very thick and does not spread as easily as other sunscreens. You need to work fast with this sunscreen. It doesn't have a white cast, but I still would not recommend it. * This product really exceeded my expectations - lightweight, blended well with no white cast, held up under makeup and especially no sunscreen smell! Tried it all summer and will definitely get it again."

Wouldnt buy again due to size vs price * This is perfect for the legs in summer when going outside. Feels silky not sticky. The chardonnay scent is really nice, not a strong sunscreen smell, sweet but not childlike. It gives a beautiful glow and enough sun protection for being outside under an hour (need higher spf for the beach). * I really love this oil. I have light skin and its very moisturizing and it does help me tan and not burn. Smell is great and feels great on skin. I wouldn't wear light color bathing suits though as the color does get on swimsuits and coverups. Also the packaging is horrible. Leaks everywhere. Wasted quite a bit of product due to leakage. I have to double zip lock baggie it to keep it from going everywhere. Please change packaging to make it less wasteful. * I'm a cancer survivor so I'm a little crazy with my sunscreen use but this year I have decided to try some of these sunscreen oils because I used to exclusively use tanning oil precancer and I'd like to get back to having a natural tan and not always having to use self tanner. I definitely don't feel comfortable going out with just oil or without SPF like I used to so I thought these would be good for me to try. 

I really like the consistency of the oil, it sinks into my skin easily and doesn't feel oily after. I really like the smell of this oil too, I actually prefer the scent of this one over the baby oil. I've tried this oil a couple of times now and so far it has kept me from getting burnt at all. It also allows me to get a base tan which is nice.

My only complaint with this product is the packaging. I received this one in a GWP and even though the bottle has a seal underneath the cap everything in the GWP bag was covered in a oily film. Luckily the seal kept it from completely spilling out but somehow it still seeped underneath. This is definitely a product I would not feel comfortable ordering online which is a problem for me because I am disabled and I don't drive. If I was able to go into the store I would probably purchase this one exclusively, but since I rely on things being delivered to me I'm going to have to continue buying the baby oil version as that bottle actually keeps the oil inside of it. * Dont buy it majre your skin break * I swear by this sunscreen oil! It protects from the sun so well, I used it while out on a 100 degree day and didn't burn. It leaves a beautiful, non-sticky glow on the skin and smells so lovely. Never change this formula, Vacation * Like the title says—it works. Functional sunscreen. I enjoy the smell and appreciate the texture. I'm not a huge fan of the feeling of lotion, so it's a great alternative. The only con I have for this product is that it leaks from the bottle. For this reason alone, I give it 4/5 stars."

I love the glow it gives but if i sweat it will get in my eyes and burn but not as bad as super goop play. I love the murad more but this is my go to on days im staying inside mostly. 

Arizona has extremely high Uv index all day, i would not use this outside again or near water. Anywhere you will sweat excessively . Its very light and comfortable but its better as a inside spf or driving spf. * I liked the gel full body version so much that I went back and bought this face one, a travel pack for myselfs and my sisters and a full size of the 50 spf for my mom. It's dropping a lil bit now to save face later. Skin cancer runs in my family (with 2 grandparents and 1 parent having chunks removed from their face and body).... So I am obsessive about avoiding it. I'm not going to get any pretty missing part of my nose lol. This stuff glides on smoothly on top of other skincare products. Make sure your face is dry enough. I don't want to scratch it off my face immediately after applying. It's high allergy season where I live so can't comment on the smell. * I'm an esthetician and have some of the oiliest skin. I would always skip SPF if I was wearing makeup because  many of them I've tried, make my makeup break down faster throughout the day. I tried this one out after trying it out in the store and to me it absorbs like a dry oil, and I can't feel it on my skin after a few minutes. I haven't had any issues with my skin over producing oil while wearing this alone or under makeup. I hope they don't stop making this product! * This goes on really nice on my face. It literally glides on like butter without the greasy feeling. I like that it has shimmer but it does not show up on your face as glitter, it's more of a glowy satin finish. I haven't noticed any pilling on bare skin or with makeup. I've paired this with Bare Minerals tinted moisturizer and it looks great. When pairing with makeup i put it on before my makeup. * I thought I'd give this a try when it was on sale and so glad I did! I wasn't using any sunscreen in my morning routine at the time. Most sunscreens I've used are thick. This one goes on lightweight and gives a sheer satin finish. I love it! * I love this product. It feels like satin going on my skin. It is absorbed instantly.The scent is great and doesn't smell like sunscreen. I actually apply it everyday first thing in the morning. * Melts into my skin and is so sensitive and gentle. I use the face and the body. I love both. I get a little glow too!"

The ELF version pills like crazy the moment I try applying it. It also started leaking out some liquid when I first opened it which was unnerving. Awful, awful smell coming from this sunscreen, too. Next time, I fear I will just have to shell out the money for the Supergoop one. * This sunscreen is a clear gel, so it has no whitecast and can be used for all skin tones. It glides on well. It doesn't sting my eyes either, which is a plus. It can feel a little weird and heavy when you first put it on, but when it dries down and absorbs into the skin, it feels like nothing is on your face. And I have VERY oily skin, so I like that this sunscreen gives me a matte finish and reduces that greasy look. And it never irritates my acne or anything, so I'm glad to say it's safe for acne-prone skin. 

However, I've noticed that sometimes, it will turn liquidy when I leave it in my room (which is warmer than my bathroom and the rest of my house), and its kind of a hassle to apply when in liquid form. And if you apply too much at a time or try to layer it, the sunscreen can pill really badly, and it looks like your skin is flaking off. That's my main downside. Otherwise, it's a solid sunscreen for darker, oily skin. * I was hoping this product was good as I feel it is a dupe to the Supergoop! Sunscreen brand which is also really great so the fact that they made an affordable version of it because it feels exactly the same and I love it! Your face feels velvety smooth and blurred. * This is a review for the Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen and Blurring Primer; I say this because other reviews mentioning glitter and sparkles are probably about the Whoa, Glow which is a different product. This has no glitter/sparkles or sheen to it at all, the texture out of the tube is like a makeup primer and it does on smoothly and is easy to spread evenly without having to use a lot of product. 

For reference, my skin is very oily all over so I have a bad relationship with sunscreens as they typically migrate all over my face as they slide around on the oil, and eventually get into and hurt my eyes. I have not had that issue with this product after a week of use, most importantly that it doesn't get into my eyes. This does not appear shiny on my skin and even helps to keep me from looking greasy so quickly, but I still use oil blotting throughout the day. This product also doesn't leave any white cast or type of color to the skin so I wear it alone without any makeup over top so I can't review on how it performs under makeup. * I wanted to love this product, but it was underwhelming overall. I enjoyed the finish of the sunscreen after its initial dry-down, but I wasn't crazy about the sparkles (glitter?) that was left on my hands after the fact. Eventually this same sparkly finish ended up looking oily enough to fry an egg on my face. On the plus side, it didn't actually feel oily. It will cause water-based foundations to break up, and if you prep with skin care before makeup then you'll want to let it all dry before applying this SPF. It pills otherwise, but again, this can be avoided by allowing other products to dry beforehand. * Oily residue - there are much better options out there - don't waste your time"

Incredibly overpriced at that. * Doesn't matter how long you let this ""set"" , you can immediately watch it wash off when you get in the pool. Gel is thick and hard to spread. * Great tanning oil. Not greasy. Love it! * I live in Salt Lake City and am outside for several hours most days. I use a bike for transport so start my day with sunscreen which I re-apply several times through the day. I tried this as I find most sunscreens to be incredibly drying. This soaks into my skin nicely and my skin is more nourished than it has been for months. It is spendy but I am super happy with it. * I will say, this did not provide the glow that I wanted it to when applying, but what a GREAT sunscreen. I've been using this at the pool at summer and It stays on even after a quick dip and doesn't smell trashy. I re-apply every two hours and have not burned once, and still come home with a wonderful suntanned-glow. * This stuff is very pretty and also goes on very easily, but do not use it by itself if you do not want to get burned. Definitely put on sunscreen first and then this on top so you dont get fried in the sun (like i did) * This suscreen smells so nice, isnt slimy or sticky, and adds a healthy looking gooe to the skin!

It burns for a while too. As soon as you use a towel/rag to soothe your eyes a minute later they'll start burning again. This can happen for hours. Wanted to love this because it doesn't leave a white cast if you rub it in enough, but the eye burning isn't worth that. * i bought this in store at the beginning of summer after an employee recommended it to me. i'm a natural redhead, so im pretty pasty and prone to skin cancer/burning easy. i was hesitant because it was super pricy - but a little goes a long way!!! i work outside in the sun all day and have every day for the summer, and i havent burnt ONCE since buying and actively using this. i still have over half the bottle after 2/3 months. it is so worth the money. * I really wanted to like this BUT I've used it a few times and for some reason, after about an hour, even though I'm not sweating, this sunscreen starts to get in my eyes and even my mouth! Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation. It has Benzophenone in it, which can cause contact  dermatitis. I get an allergic reaction on my eyelids every time I've used this product. * OMG this is the best sunscreen I've found for my skin, it's refreshing and soft and doesn't leave your skin white or thought of it. I loved it * Goes on white but leaves no white cast on brown skin after rubbing it in. I love how the spray disperses the product evenly. I dont recommend using it on your face directly though.

This SPF is perfect for this dreadful Texas humidity and heat. It's very lightweight, non-greasy, and has a pleasant scent. Reapplying is a breeze since the product doesn't build up on the skin or cause a film. It's very breathable and works well with general skin sensitivities. The size is quite large for travel, but still small enough to throw in your beach bag and still have space for other necessities. It has a click-locking spray top so it doesn't accidentally spray in your bag. I will say that if your skin is very dry, you may want to go for a cream SPF because this does not provide much moisture. This is definitely made for hot, sunny summers. I love it and I know for sure I am buying a full-sized bottle to keep on hand.

***This review was collected as part of a promotion.*** * As a professional in the beauty industry, I've learned firsthand the  importance of sun protection, making COOLA's  spray an indispensable asset. In an industry where skincare is very important, COOLA stands out with its dedication to not only protecting against harmful UV rays but also enhancing the overall experience of sun care.

COOLA's sunscreen spray doesn't just shield your skin from UVA and UVB rays; Its broad-spectrum protection ensures comprehensive coverage, safeguarding against both premature aging and potential skin damage. As someone deeply invested in skin health, I love COOLA's commitment to providing a product that protects and cares for my skin.

The scent of Piña Colada fragrance is delicious. Gone are the days of sunscreen smelling like, well, sunscreen. Instead, COOLA's tropical scent transports me to my last vacation. It's a big change from the clinical smell of traditional sunscreens, making the application process a sensory experience.

I did not have any issue in my delicate skin but I always recommend  a patch test.

In my personal opinion, COOLA's in spray isn't just a sun protection product; it's an  evolution of skincare. With its comprehensive protection, anti-aging benefits, and irresistible Piña Colada scent, COOLA has redefined what it means to stay safe in the sun. So, whether I am lounging by the pool or hitting the beach, I make COOLA my go-to companion for summer adventures. And a big pus smells delicious! * The COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a delightful sun protection experience. Its tropical scent evokes visions of sunny beaches and relaxation, enhancing the application process with a touch of indulgence. The organic formula boasts SPF 30, providing reliable protection against both UVA and UVB rays, crucial for preventing sunburn and long-term skin damage. What sets this sunscreen apart is its lightweight texture, which absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. This feature is particularly appealing for those who dislike the heavy feeling often associated with sunscreen application. The spray mechanism ensures effortless and even coverage, making it convenient for reapplication throughout the day, especially during outdoor activities. Furthermore, the use of organic ingredients adds to its appeal for those who prioritize natural  products. 

 In conclusion, the COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a luxurious and effective sun protection solution for those who appreciate both quality and indulgence in their routine. * As a licensed Esthetician, we our taught early on how important using SPF to protect our skin. This aerosol is easy to use and smells amazing! If you have sensitive skin I would recommend spraying into your hands first then applying. I did have a slightly burning feel when I sprayed directly. But, overall I really love how cute and small and effective this spf is to use. My skin adapted the more I used this spf. * I love this sunscreen! Its perfect for travel and smells great. I used it almost all up on my recent vacation. It smells likea tropical holiday on a beach with a coconut. I would definetly recommend. I know the spf is quality and better packaged and easily portable. * This review was collected as part of a promotion. My name is Michele and I'm a Beauty Expert in my early 30's with fair combination skin. As the weather gets warmer, I have to make sunscreen a priority in my skincare routine. I am absolutely loving the Coola Clear Spray Body Sunscreen SPF 30 Piña Colada Sunscreen. I love its yummy, natural Piña Colada scent. It takes me away on a vacation to my favorite beach. This is a non-aerosol sunscreen that is so easy to spray onto your skin. It has a lightweight, lighter than air, mist texture that absorbs so quickly into my skin without leaving any greasy residue. I got the chance to try the full size 6 fluid ounce version of this spray sunscreen. This sunscreen is formulated with at least 70% Organic Ingredients. You get broad spectrum SPF 30 UVA and UVB protection. This sunscreen has water resistance that lasts up to 80 minutes so you can enjoy more time in the sun and water without worrying about reapplying every hour. With this amazing sunscreen you not only protect your skin but keep it hydrated too. Plant Protection is formulated with antioxidant rich nutrients which help fight free radicals, hydrates and nourishes your skin barrier too. Safflower Oleosomes is plant derived encapsulation technology that makes this formulation even more effective. Spray this sunscreen on your skin 15 minutes before any sun exposure. Make sure to reapply this sunscreen every 80 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone of any age who loves the sun and wants to have lightweight, long lasting and fast absorbing sun protection that also keeps your skin hydrated too. * Sun care is very important because it can help prevent skin cancer. I can't stress enough how important it is to wear sunscreen everyday. I was looking for a new everyday sunscreen and I think I found it. I prefer spray sunscreen than a cream so this one is perfect. It smells absolutely amazing and I love it! With most sunscreens they can get really heavy and greasy. I was really pleased that it absorbs really well on the skin and doesn't leave a layer of oil behind. Another thing I like is the ingredients, because I was having a hard time finding sunscreens that didn't have harsh or harmful ingredients. The Coola brand has organic and vegan ingredients so no worries about having harmful chemicals being absorbed in your body. So far so good and I would repurchase it."

I use it during the day for the sun protection and the glow it gives. You want to spray generously and not skim out on it. The scent is also not too overpowering. * Just no * Beautiful not greasy I buy this over and over try it you won't be disappointed * This gets everywhere oily. You absolutely cannot use it inside or your floors will be slick. I still burn reapplying this too. * Wore this, let it set, and got in pool. 15 minutes later I was blue from the pools paint. This thinned it, removed it, and stuck it to my body while destroying the pools paint. * It was working okay but after 3 weeks of using it almost everday I started to develop rashes. They were circular (kinda likr cigarette burns) reddish, and flaky. They get itchy sometimes. I know it is this product because this is the only new one I've used. Now I don't know what to do with all these rashes and skin damage I've sustained. * Great hand spray type top instead of those one finger kind of press button things. The hand grippy spray allows for easier application in hard to reach areas."

Lasted all day 
Didn't have to reapply even when laying in my pool for hours! * I wanted to love it. The price point was what sold me so, I decided to give it a try this summer. I had never used a gel sunscreen and it just didn't work for me. It doesn't go on well with makeup. The end result ends up looking like your face is peeling. * its a little pricey and it's personaly too glowy for me, but overall its a great product! * If you like glowy luminous skin and sunscreen that doenst feel like sunscreek then you will love this. I know I do. I've been using this now for about two years. It's one of my favorites. * Kinda grainy and greasy and too warm a tone. I love several Tula products, but this was not one for me. But the couple times I used it, it didn't seem to irritate my skin. * this sunscreen has a lot of pros, skincare and the dewy glow it gives while being super lightweight. i have super sensitive skin and could barley tolerate this most days becsuse of how much it would sting and burn or make my skin breakout in a rash. some days i could tolerate it but most says i couldnt, i swear it made me burn more when i took it to the beach. just beware if you put sunscreen on your neck chest and face and dont wear any AHA/BHA/or chemical exfoliants your skin will breakout. this is  for ppl w a great skin barrier"

It's rather expensive though for what you get- considering it's a body sunscreen, this wouldn't even get you through a week at the beach. * No matter which supergoop I try they are heavy greasy they do block the sun but feel horrible * Me gusta mucho, no deja la piel grasosa, te da brillo y protege * Absolutely terrible! I broke out in a rash about an hour after using. Theew it away immediately! * I love the OG unseen sunscreen for my face and its the perfect texture and viscosity. I was hoping this would be too. I hate the lotion texture of others so i was really excited that SG came out witb this. The only problem is that its just oily… it absorbs well and makes my skin feel REALLY SOFT but since i do sweat pretty easily it can feel a bit slick at times. Maybe its the olive oil in it? Or its just too many oils. * Goes on like silk and absorbs quickly. * This is a unique sunscreen. It slides onto my skin without an oily feel and immediately disappears like water. I like working in the yard. The Unseen Sunscreen Body enables me to be outside without getting a tan or sunburn in this hot summer sun. Other brands of sunscreen have felt oily and were a bit difficult to apply without some effort. The Supergoop! spread easily. It was a delightful surprise!"

They gave me bumps and a rash, that still have not gone away in over a week. I would not recomend this to anyone who has sensitive skin, because I don't have sensitive skin and it gave me an allergic reaction. * If you are remotely melanated, this is NOT the sunscreen for you (unless you don't care about white cast). Even after rubbing this in really well, the white cast doesn't go away. I do feel like this does a great job preventing sunburn, though. * I really wanted to like this product but it made me smell horrible for days somehow despite saying it was unscented and it left a white cast on me that was extremely hard to blend in. After sweating, you could see the white cast build up more and I was constantly having to rub the sunscreen in. * great sun coverage did not get burned at all after being in the sun but this is a super thick mineral sunscreen that can be hard to blend in and leaves a white cast behind. * While getting ready for a trip, failed to read the reviews. Used the sunscreen on my fair/white legs and ended up whiter than ever, embarrassed at the beach. These formulation, looks and feel like the products developed during the late 80's. I can't believe this type of formulation in 2024. * I tried to like this sunscreen but it leaves your face white, it's super thick, hard to blend in, and leaves little white dots (peels off) all over your face."

I have fair skin (120 in Fenty) and the light shade worked well for me.  It might be a tiny bit too dark, but it's so sheer that the color blends away and doesn't leave a line.  This has essentially no coverage, even for a tinted moisturizer so don't expect even light coverage with this.  I could deal with that and just use this as a sunscreen if it were not SO OILY.  It remains tacky and shiny even after letting it sink in for half an hour.  I am in my 40s and have very dry skin.  My skin is so dry that I use face oil with my moisturizer at night so I never thought I would say that a product is too oily.  I thought that my summer daytime moisturizer might be too heavy to use with this tinted moisturizer so I tried it without my normal skin care on bare skin the second time I used it.  It's still a greasy mess on my dry as the Sahara skin and the oil never sinks in.  The tint rubs off and leaves a mess if anything touches your face.  I just don't understand the reasoning behind a greasy, tinted sunscreen with no coverage that leaves color on anything that touches your face. * The sunscreen itself I enjoy and is great for my sensitive skin. However, the tube it comes in, is a mess! The sunscreen is so thin, it really needs to come in a pump style not a squeeze style. I feel like I've lost half of the product already because it leaks out the sides. * 1. I only wear mineral spf - if you can do chemical - i wouldn't recommend this. There are so many elegant chemical formulas, especially in k-beauty! 
2. This stuff IS moisturizing and doesn't really dry down. great for dry skin or when set with powder- but i wouldn't recommend to oily girlies. 
3. Its  VERY runny- so make sure to shake it before applying. The packaging gets pretty messy for that reason - i think a dropper bottle would be perfect. 

I use this when my skin needs moisture, like after retinol or AHA. Im pretty pale and the tint is perfect. All universal tinted spfs are too orange for me. 

While i don't this daily, I really do like it and find it's been a staple for my dry or sensitive days. * this oily soup of a sunscreen should not be appearing in the ""CC cream"" or other searches for ulta. to say it's tinted is a farse, it is slightly in appearance to be non-white. it is also the oiliest, runniest cosmetic I have ever encountered. I have dry skin and couldn't even absorb it after many attempts at blending (which then eliminated any coverage it provided). the end feel was disgusting and greasy and it gave acne within 24 hours. also, the packaging doesn't seal well. in just one day it seeped out into my makeup bag. Just awful all around. * I got the medium-deep color and it is the most fantastic sunscreen I have ever found. I notice that my skin does not burn or significantly tan despite Southern summer heat, so I know it is working. Most sunscreens meant for darker skin have a much lower percentage of active ingredients and I worry I am not getting anti-aging coverage, but this one really has everything a darker skinned person could ask for. I recommend it to everyone with dark skin because not only is it an effective sunscreen, it also looks like a light foundation layer. I wear it when I have photoshoots and it looks great, my makeup artist agrees!

My only complaint is that I can no longer find it in stores like I used to, and I hope they will not discontinue it! * This sunscreen has a good shade range and is great for my dry, sensitive skin. Does not irritate my eyes or break me out, which many sunscreens do to me."

It smells so good, isnt greasy, rubs in really well. Im not sure i would pay full price but i stock up on sale and it is worth it. * This product separated about a few days after I purchased it. No matter how much i shaked it, it was never the same again. I still got sunburnt really bad at the beach even when I was diligently reapplying a lot every 2 hours as instructed on the bottle. The scent is okay & it makes me feel greasy but because of that it does leave a nice sheen, which i like. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product. In fact, i think its very dangerous that they are advertising this as spf 50 when the sun protection didnt help me at the beach. I was surprised to find out how burnt i got because i was also hanging out in my beach tent for majority of the day. For those who have a history of skin cancer or concerned about it, i would stay away from this. * Great SPF. Vacation makes an excellent line of products. My husband puts this on everytime he goes deep sea fishing and it works. * Smells great and isnt sticky or thick, i wish the scent was a little stronger though * Works well if you don't plan on going into water.

That being said, the bottle is way to small, it also says to use another spf with the product to protect your skin. Its a lovely product but for the amount you receive ans having to use another product with it, its not worth the purchase. Save your money * This product does work abaoultoey wonderul im a very pale person and rbis prsoxut has gave me rhe best tan with no burn but the bottle is really small ive only used it three times and its almost out * I bought this on a whim to try as i was desperate for any sun tanning solution and let me say this has been an unexpected winner! I used it while at a water park hoping to get my backside even and my legs to match my arms. This product has worked better then I could've ever imagined. It smells amazing, a little goes a long way, and it gets you a very nice even tan all throughout your body wherever you use it. I did go ahead and layer the product first having it as my base then a layer of sunblock and then I topped it off with another layer on top. If there was only one thing I could complain about, it would be the amount that you get for the price. While a little does go along way. I just don't know if the price offsets everything else. * The bottle is freaking tiny for 23 dollars. i shouldve looked at the ounces but the bottle just looked bigger in the picture. im not sure how good it is ive only used it once but it smells good * I don't waste my time writing reviews. But girl I need to tell you what just happened. So I am so pale, I know so sad. Okay, so I didn't want a tanning oil to give me a false tan, and ma'am when I tell YOU that I'm proud of this tan because I earned it. The oil smells so nice. I paired it with an spf 50, and I'm new to tanning and you best believe I burn easy. So when I tell you I TANNED. I feel so much better about the way I look. When I say it's only been 15 MINUTES, Jaw on the floor. Picking it up now because it is still devolving and I'm STILL getting darker. Like girl…my pasty self is getting darker? Yes…take my money agin because I'm getting another. I'm bummed I'm only getting like 7-10 uses out of it. But if it works it works. And I am working with this sun right now. Watch me be a bronze goodness by the SUMMER girl. 10/10 oil, you won't find anything better. I promise you that * I never write reviews, but i have to tell you guys everything about this. So i never bought oil before right, so i didnt know where to start. I was so afraid to burn or get a fake tan too like the other products. Oh my gosh guys, this oil works so well. It smells so good too. It doesnt give you a false tint or anything before hand and it will activally make you proud of your tan. I always hated fake reviews from insta or tiktok, but i found this one by myself and im so surprised it woked so well. Im super pale, and i never go out. The way it tanned me in one session..flabbergasted…immediately. I feel so confident. I pairded it with a spf 50, and the oil.  The oil gave me such an even and bronze tan. Its still forming curently. But this is within 15 MINUTES. Im so dispapointed the bottle is so small for the price. It will give me 7-10 sessions. But honestly its be worth it."

They really compliment my skin and I am obsessed. I feel like this really works with my skin tone. This is the first face bronzing drops that work for me. I wear this under my tinted SPF. * I was hesitant to try this because most bronzers have either been too dark or orange. This product is perfect for me. After a week at the beach, I struggle with makeup because my body is much more tan than my face. This has given me a perfect tan and glow using it on its own. As my tan fades I will try blending it with my makeup. An added benefit is the spf. In love with this product and would highly recommend * Perfect addition for my beach necessities. I am fair skinned ans it was not too dark! It has buildable coverage and it was just what I needed for sun protection! * Vacation summer must have! These bronzing drops have a serum like consistency making it super easy to blend smoothly with other serums & moisturizers. I like how this feels on my skin, it is light weight and does not leave my face feeling greasy. This pairs great under makeup or alone for a sun-kissed  glowy look while protecting your skin from harmful UVA & UVB rays! Ive been wearing it on beach and pool days and i absolutely love it! Definitely reccomend! * Vacation's Bronzing Drops offer a subtle, sun-kissed glow ideal for achieving a natural-looking tan without the harmful effects of UV exposure. 

The drops blend smoothly with moisturizers or serums, making them versatile and easy to use. The formula is lightweight, non-greasy, and enhances skin with a warm, radiant tint. 

While they deliver an impressive instant bronzing effect, the tint is temporary and requires regular application for maintenance. * This made my skin look like I had haphazardly rubbed dirt on it. And whatever is in it made my face break out in red, itchy blotches. * Hello Beauties, my name is Andrea. I am a beauty enthusiast.

I love being out in the sun, so suncare is a priority for me.

So, to find a bronzer that has skincare and suncare benefits to it is remarkable.

Vacation Studio Tone 3-in-1 Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Bronzing Drops for face is the perfect product it's not just suncare but skincare as well. It bronzes, nourishes, and protects skin from sunburn.

It gives amazing sun protection throughout the day and can even be worn in the night.

I must mention that the packaging is great. I love the dropper it is convenient and makes applying this product easy and mess free.

This bronzer applies nicely without sticky residue and is great for all skin types and skin tones.

This bronzer helps me to achieve the perfect sunkiss skin every time.

It has just the right amount of shimmer to give you that luminous glow and that satiny, dewy finish.

It can be used alone or layered under makeup without affecting my makeup application.

I absolutely recommend this product. Vacation Studio Tone is a must-have."

I have fairer skin and the pinkish tone blended well but took a bit of working it into the skin to not leave a white cast or streaking * I've been searching for years for a moisturizing, non-pore-clogging daily spf and this is finally it. If I find it on sale, I can get it at a pricer similar to other ones. Also, I can skip my current NIOD Survival 0 as this has antioxidants, so that makes the price more palatable. My skin is dry, also now mature, and no other sunscreen has moisturized me except kinship sport which is too greasy/takes too long to dry down. This takes just a minute to soak in, the pink/sheer evens tone, leaves skin dewy but not shiny. First one I can use over serum without a separate moisturizer. I have mild rosacea and psoriasis, no flakes or extreme dryness, but trouble keeping hydrated which shows lines/pores, I love this. Never tried the old formula. One star off only for the price (and the small cap). * This spf is too thick, greasy, gave me closed comedones and white heads, it sucks, try something else. I have combination skin but lean more towards the drier side. * What is with companies and reformulating lately?
If it ain't broke, don't fix it!
I have been wearing this sunscreen for years in the ""sheer"" recently I purchased in store and the first day of use I knew something was off. The texture was thicker, and it did not sink into my skin per usual leaving my skin tacky. I also had a weird tingly sensation on my skin which has never happened before.
I decided to reach out to the company and this is what they said ""Thank you for reaching out to us! Yes we have launched a new Umbra! We updated quite a bit; in fact, it's almost more accurate to think of Umbra Mineral Creams as new formulas rather than reformulations. We included a wider range of plant extracts and vitamins, each of which are known for their ability to offset UV damage, including astaxanthin, vitamin C, ubiquinone, and green tea seed oil..."".  
In my opinion whatever they did to the product made it worse. I ended up returning it."

It pairs well for me while I use tret since it is so hydrating. However, it does sit on the skin as VERY oily. But it doesnt break me out and is light, so I'm leaning towards this being a good product that I will probably rebuy. * Sunscreen works well. It's lightweight and blends easily. Plus it's not greasy which is great. My old facial sunblock would get so greasy when out and about in the sun, this one does not. * Wanted to try it and and its me new fave. * Yes, it really is invisible! I have acne prone skin and it does not break me out. This is my favorite sunscreen to date! This is the first La Roche-Posay product I've used and it's making me want to try more! * Painfully dry lips, swelling in cheeks. Never had a reaction to an SPF quite like this. * I'm not sure if its the ""dewy finish"" or whatever, but this sunscreen is very oily on my skin. It feels like a layer. However it is invisible which is a plus. * I tried this off and on for about a month and i love the texture of it and how it applies and it does hydrate for a little bit but after a few hours my face would be dry. The reason i had to stop using is because it caused skin redness and my skin would appear irritated."

I now look like a tomato and have sun poisoning. Don't waste your money * I used this sunscreen recently at an amusement park and it was 90s the whole time. Good news is that I didn't get burnt but I felt sticky the whole day. It was pretty uncomfortable. I would buy again if there was a dry touch option. * Unfortuately this product pilled a lot and was not sweat resitant for me. Dissappinted :( * As a ginger, sunscreen is very important to me. After using a bunch of different spf 50s on my trip, this has stayed #1! The smell is amazing, the spray is very powerful and only needs a little bit since it goes such a long way, and it leaves a nice glow without too much oil! I heavily recommend this spf! * perfect sunscreen for wandering the city, hiking, just sitting outside, not greasy which is so major, smells unique in a good way * DON'T BUY!! Does NOT work!!!! Went camping and had the family use this spf and we all ended up burnt! I take sunscreen very seriously and this the first time with any that hasn't worked! Not worth it!! * I don't know what was in this sunscreen, but I was really looking forward to a convenient spray SPF. I put it on my forearms and neck in late morning and was put off by the scent, but brushed it off. Later that night, I noticed small, red pinpricks all over my arms. I woke up the next morning and the dots had become red bumps, and were noticeable over my neck, looking similar to acne. As of now, about 36 hours later, my arms are still covered in bumps, though they are no longer red. I have no known allergies, so I don't know what caused this reaction. All this to say, I have not enjoyed this experience, and the scent is unpleasant anyways."

Just make sure it doesnt get in your eyes. * My only critique is that the packaging itself is fairly small, meaning not as much product as i predicted. But it works well nonetheless. * This product is cute, works well and smells good. The size of the container was as expected and makes it super portable, but the amount of product was disappointing. I probably wouldn't have even realized how little product there was in the tube, but when I first opened the tube the product fell out exposing how much was really in there. I'm talking about a half an inch worth of product in the 3.5 inch tall tube… The packaging clearly says 0.7 oz, but you don't realize how little that is. * found this and said oh perfect! needed something to keep in my bag for sunscreen on long motorcycle trips. this is a great size teardrop shaped stick that goes on smooth and clear, smells really nice and light. definitely would recommend this to everyone! packaging is also on point ☝🏻 * The only way I will be applying SPF from now on! This sunscreen stick is pocket size, put it in your purse, beach bag… & your good to go. I love the way it feels on my skin, giving me a natural looking glow. Absolutely no white cast, as this goes on clear. I definitely reccomend! * The Vacations Sunscreen Stick is fantastic! It's compact and easy to carry, making reapplication throughout the day a breeze. 

The formula is smooth, non-greasy, and provides excellent sun protection. Plus, it has a pleasant scent and doesn't leave a white cast. Perfect for on-the-go sun care! * I'm absolutely in love with the Vacation Super Stick SPF 45! The edgy shape ensures precise application, and it makes my skin feels very silky smooth. It goes on clear with a beautiful satin finish that felt perfect under my makeup. As someone with oily skin, I appreciate that it doesn't cause any breakouts or extra oiliness to my skin. I highly recommend!"

The bonus was that it's a lotion, 50 spf and formulated for sensitive skin. Tried it, got burned, skin is now sensitive and itchy. The cap makes it very messy to dispense. * Just got back from 9 nights in Cancun, and I'm tan with no burn at all thanks to this stuff! Unlike most white mineral sunscreens, this one actually soaks in & leaves no cast on your skin. It also feels super moisturizing and keeps you from burning! * Just bought this to tan. A lot of other sunscreens will still have me leaving (slightly) burnt no matter how many times I re-apply even if its before the recommend time. But with this sunscreen, i tanned out in the sun (under the amount of time before i needed to re-apply) and i didnt burn even a little!!! Very effective and works well, but it really does leave a bad white cast which is the downside because the white cast is very noticeable and doesn't blend away. I also find this sunscreen to be very greasy compared to other's but it doesn't bother me as much as the white cast does. * It's so oily and leaves a huge white cast. It's terrible. * Went on a trip to Hawaii and needed a reef safe sunscreen. Use this before on my face and I will say it was too greasy. However, this time I used it on my body and it was perfect. Would definitely use again in the future for body * This is the greasiest sunscreen I've ever used.  I hate it so much.  My skin stayed greasy for over an hour after applying.  This stuff is an oil slick. * This gives me a white cast at first but blends in quickly. Leaves a slight greasy feel but tolerable. This doesn't break me out or irritate my skin at all which is great. I like that it's reef safe and has a cool color-changing cap."

It feels like I'm putting nothing onto my face, yet still getting the needed coverage, which is the only way I want to feel about sunscreen and makeup; natural. 

The only downside to this product is that it notes a necessary re-application every 40 minutes if swimming or sweating. The swimming part I don't care about, but I'm an oily gal in the summertime. That's a lot of re-applicating, especially considering the amount you're getting for the price. Just some food for thought. * Love using this sunscreen * I repurchased this sunscreen when it was part of Ulta's Beauty Steals. I love this sunscreen as it's easy to wear, doesn't leave a white cast on my skin, and doesn't cause breakouts. I gave it four stars because at the regular price, I would try to find a cheaper alternative. * I bought this by accident, thinking I was getting the tinted version which I love. When I opened it and saw it was the Unseen version, I thought I'd try it. I really like it! Even when I use tinted Supergoop! on my face, I use this for my neck, décolleté, and hands. When I choose to use this on my face, it goes on smoothly, feels much like a primer, and works great with makeup. It's a keeper for me! * A family member loves the sunscreen, so I am always buying it for them. For me it can pill  time to time. 

However, I do like the texture of this. No white  cast. 
If you don't have acne prone skin, then this is a good option * This product goes on so silky and smooth. Love it. Does the job. * Very light and doesn't leave a residue on skin."

It rubs into the skin so easily. It does not pill or leave a white cast. Its very moisturizing as well. It gives your skin a subtle glow. It does not overly burn your eyes either if some gets into them. It lays great under makeup. I spent a week in Florida and i used this daily and my face/ neck DID NOT BURN.
I love this product! * I wanted to test out a few different SPF's with vitamin C. This product by far has the best feel and moisturization without being too heavy or oily. I hate the smell of sunscreen and this smell was very potent in this product. If it was not for the smell, it would be my go to but instead I went for Muad Environmental Shield SPF 50. This product is a little more oily, but smells so much better! * I got sample size of the sunscreen and I'm almost finished just ordered full size❤️❤️❤️love the texture blend easily and no whitecast * I wanted to love this so bad, but couldn't do it after using it for a few weeks. I have oily skin and this just added even more to it. I loved the texture of it, but after applying it felt too heavy on my skin. This also has your typical sunscreen smell to it which is not horrible, but could potentially push people away. I kept going back to my EltaMD UV clear as it leaves a matte finish for me. I'm sure Kiehls would be great for people with dry skin! * I will forvere use this product. The serum texture makes it an amaing last skincare step. In love is an understatement. * Im a MUA of 20+ yrs. This is the first and best not only spf that doesnt leave a cast EVER but isnt thick or cloges pores, and forget about it being sunscreen it's ACTUAL SKINCARE!! Where has this been all my life, Im on my 2nd bottle and not only that but I broke my ankle and didnt use for 1 week and I had wrinkles on my forehead I never knew I had, started using it again religiously and I mean every time I'm outside every two hours like you're supposed to with SPF. And with the collogen and other delicious stuff afteIm 41 and look you ger than my 35 year old hus and and those lines are GONE AGAIN. How are there only 8 revies on this!! I get it its very exspensive for a ""sunscreen"" but if your not using 50 on  your face every 2 hours outside sun/shade your damaging your skin and it was only when I found this that I saw the significant difference. I have hyper sensitive skin and hated using SPF's before esp in combo with any skin care because it just never felt right on my face or had any benefits so always did both seperate. Never again!! I dont work or have affiliation with the brand or product it's just that amazing and I have to tell you it is worth every little penny please don't let the price tag scare you because what it will give you back will save you all the injectables. You do all the facials that you get it is truly mind blowing. I will never go without this and make sure I have an extra bottle before I run low. This is how I think…. Whats your skin/ youth looking face worth to you and too try it for free for 60 days and see the results or get your $$ back why wouldnt you!!! * Lightweight face sunscreen that doesn't leave a sticky, greasy, or opaque residue. Skin feels soft and nourished. After two wears, I feel like this will be a staple. Reasonable price is the icing on the cake."

I love spray sunscreens but this was a waste of money. The nozzle stopped working after just a few uses. * I don't usually leave reviews, but I was super disappointed in this one.  The nozzle stopped working almost immediately, I didn't even get one leg fully covered before it clogged up.  Luckily I had a backup lotion with me. Other Blue Lizard products have been great. * I would say this product is a firm no for me as I PERSONALLY experienced a minor allergic reaction on my arms and it made them really itchy with small bumps. I had high hopes it would work fantastically as it's mineral with high spf but it's unfortunately a no for me :( * I love Blue Lizard's other products, but the spray nozzle stopped working only after a couple of sprays. * Sirays on so easy. Applies with minimal effort to rub in after spraying on. Has the most mild scent out if all the products, probably due to the application process. It wirks so well. Full day of baseball camp, and my son had zero burns at all. Just a beautiful tan. Highly recommened this product. * I bought this for a trip to Maui with my husband. The bottle looks to be a decent size - a little smaller than your average spray sunscreen container. The product itself worked well. There was a slight white cast but it wasn't bad. It felt like it was stuck to our skin (in a good way) and definitely protected us from the sun. HOWEVER... The bottle literally lasted  us 2 applications each, so 4 full body applications total! And we are relatively small people. Is this a joke?? Good thing that was all we needed for our trip, but that's DEFINITELY not worth the money. Such a bummer!"

Otherwise it is a pretty pricey sunscreen. I was worried about trying it out because every single time I've had anything with SPF it made me break out. Idk what it is and as a reference I have super dry skin. I dont get much acne or breakouts unless my skin is unhappy with a product. Finally I found an SPF item my skin approves of. Hopefully you get a good sale on it! * I really like this sunscreen, because it's cruelty-free, gentle, & NON-water-resistant.  I have used it on my face  over cruelty-free spf30 moisturizer, my arms, & legs.  It has a pleasant vanilla smell & uses tumeric & other gentle ingredients.  I was disappointed in the expiration date, however, & returned it.  Will order another one online to hopefully get a better exp. date.  I recommend it highly! * I love this sunscreen! It is one of the only ones I've tried that doesn't break me out. I have normal, but dehydrated skin that is fairly sensitive and acne prone. The zinc oxide in this sunscreen really helps calm redness and irritation in my skin and is somewhat hydrating whereas some sunscreens I've tried for acne prone skin were too drying for me. I used this for years and decided to try other sunscreens, but I ended up coming back to this one as others i tried just didnt compare. * It leaves a dewy sheen, has a pleasant smell, and did not break me out. For me, it was just too thick feeling on my skin, so I will be returning. But, I really do get why it's popular. * I have been using this sunscreen for a while (probably almost 2 years). I do mix in a little bit of tinted sunscreen from another brand, but can wear this on its own. The best things about this sunscreen are that it wears well under makeup and it provides amazing protection. My make up lasts just as long with this underneath, and does not change the finish. Sometimes I feel like it makes it look better. 

The protection on this is phenomenal. I went to an all day concert this weekend, and used this with my holy grail foundation that lasts through almost anything and for over 15 hours. I forgot to put sunscreen on my arms for the first hour, and got a little red even though I put sunscreen on pretty early. However, my face was not burned AT ALL, and I was in the sun a lot. 

I dont usually wear this one on its own, I usually wear a more tinted one if I am not wearing makeup, but this is my favorite sunscreen under make up, hands down, and the highest % protection out of any of my other sunscreens. Highly recommend! * I have been trying so many different sunscreens and so many i havent liked. The kinship is amazing and its great for dry skin. Works well with the vitimin C serum im uaong. I will definitely repurchase * I have tried so many sunscreens for the face. A lot of them are nice, but eventually break me out. The ones that don't make my eyes water, and make me look very oily. This sunscreen looks very nice on the face. It evens out my skin tone a bit, and moisturizes. It can be a little tacky, but the finish looks so nice, I don't mind. Some days I use a light hand and dust some setting powder over top. This gives a nice glow, while letting your natural skin tone shine through. Definitely give us a try."

It's not to cakey or greasy feeling after it's applied. It rubbed into the skin well and didn't leave that white ghostly residue. This lasted a while. With swimming I did have to reapply it more frequently. It's a nice consistency. The size of the bottle is perfect to throw in your bag for on the go. I loved that it was oil free. I had no issues with breakouts after using this multiple times. * Did not work well for me. Peels and does nor rub in easily. * This is the only sunscreen I've used in my face that didn't make me break out in white heads, and is one of the few that doesn't leave a white cast on my skin (I'm black). It does tend to sting my eyes if I've been wearing it for awhile and have been sweating, but it's easy to prevent if I don't apply any directly under my eyes, and if I only use a small amount on my forehead. The eye burning is literally the only issue. I'd rather that than a breakout or look like a pasty faced clown lol * this sunscreen doesnt cause breakouts in my highly acne prone skin. i also have super oily skin and this sets in my face pretty matte, with zero white cast. some days it can be flakey under makeup but make sure to moisturize good and it looks good under makeup * Would not purchase again!!! * I try to wear sunscreen on my fave daily.

I'm unsure why. The product is thick. I don't use it as a standalone sunscreen.

I've repurchased several times now, and I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear it. It's lightweight but moisturizing, the perfect glowy base for makeup (but also beautiful on its own!), smells luxe and divine, and has the perfect amount of SPF for everyday use. But while the product itself is incredible, I think the packaging needs work. I love the glass for sustainability reasons, but once the product starts to run low, it's incredibly hard to get the pump to work. I can visibly see that there's plenty more product in the container, but the pump won't retrieve it. Once I get to the end I have to unscrew the pump and use a tiny spatula to get the last of it out. This sunscreen is pricey, so I'm definitely trying to get my money's worth here, and the packaging makes it difficult to do so. It's not enough to stop me from buying it because I love this product so much (and I am PICKY about sunscreen), but I do hope COOLA sees this and makes a change soon. * I got a sample of this product from Ulta and had a horrible reaction to it. I got hives, my face was so swollen and red, and I was itchy. Definitely do a swab test if youre going to use this product, and give it time to react (I didn't react until about 8 hours after putting it on). * This is the second summer I've been using this sunscreen and I love it! Has protection and makes you glow. I always get compliments on my skin when I wear it * I love this product. You need very little. But, my skin looks amazing with it. * I wore this a few times without a problem but got a bad rash on my forehead today. I had no other products on my face so it had to be this. It was very hot today so maybe the product causes rash at certain temps? Others have also experienced this rash based on the reviews and I never have had a reaction like this to another sunscreen or facial product in general. I would avoid this product * I like the product, but it leaves a white cast after applying. I don't think l will order this again. * I wanted to love this serum for multiple reasons. The idea of a glowy sunscreen that I could wear instead of regular sunscreen to give an extra glow for makeup was great. Reality not so much. I felt like when it went on it was so glowy that it just highlighted my pores? Also not positive but pretty sure this makes my skin breakout. I dont vary in my skincare but when I do to wear this…I break out. So maybe it is just a fault with my skin reacting"

I took my most recent jug on a bachelorette trip and we all left glowing without sunburning. * Really happy with this sunscreen so far! Usually my least favorite part about sunscreen is how oily and greasy I feel and look, but this one dries/absorbs really nicely so I do not look like I am shining/oily from the sunscreen layer.  I also haven't had any issues with staining on clothes, which I have had issues with other sunscreens. * This sunscreen is fantastic! Unlike most sunscreens, this one doesn't have a white cast and it doesn't feel sticky. It's expensive but definitely worth the price. * I like to travel with this sunscreen. It works to protect my whole body.  Excellent. * I never write reviews, but this is truly one of the best beauty products I've ever added to my routine. I have very dry skin and this keeps me so glowy and just makes my skin look so healthy. I can definitely see it in my skin when I'm not using it. It has improved the look of my skin over time as well it's always so soft and it helps to calm down my redness. BUY THIS !!! * I love all other supergoop products, however this one smelt like mosquito spray to me & left me very oily.

I have spent full days at the lake and used other products without a problem but this, over just a couple hours and with multiple applications I still got burned. We ended up switching back to our regular lotion and got some relief later but I am truly disappointed and my skin is paying the price and looks very damaged and bright red. I would caution everyone to bring a backup lotion if they try this. * Looks good on its own but also looks beautiful under makeup. Made my skin really glowy and hydrated. Didn't break me out at all either. * Cons: 
Stings my eyes after it migrates. The oils are also suspected of causing breakouts which I don't usually have. Also, per ounce, it's a bit expensive as I wear SPF daily and reapply.

Pros: The consistency, protection (minus the eye area), and scent. Makeup application on top is fairly good. * I can't even express how good this product is, it's so lightweight I've never felt a product so lightweight before and it worked so well with all of my skin care products and my make up, there's no white cast it's super lightweight and it doesn't pill. The price is a little much, but it's totally Worth it if you wear make up a lot or if you want a really good SPF that doesn't pill, I'm mostly talking for make up girls that need a SPF that won't pill under their skin care and make up * absolutely the best spf i've tried, i've tried laneige, sunbum, and numerous other spfs but this has been the best so far! it's lightweight and makes my skin glow! * I really had high hopes for this and was upset when I saw the white cast it left. * I use this as a face sunscreen and I completely agree with the other reviews. It does have a tacky transparent finish, but I've found that this makes it the PERFECT under makeup sunscreen and primer 2 in 1. leaves skin looking hydrated!"

Originally I was apprehensive about the price (especially since it was my first time trying it) BUT it spreads well with a small amount, it's a decent size, it has just the right amount of shimmer and it absorbs into the skin quickly so once it's applied, you'd immediately forget it's even there if it didn't make you sparkle. Honestly, no complaints about it personally. However, if you have oily skin that breaks out easily and you plan to use it, whether on your face or body, I would be conscious of that given that it's an oily substance rather than a lotion. * Love the way it smells, but It doesn't apply as easy as you'd think, it's a thicker consistency and i feel like you need to apply allot * This has either 0 SPF or ATTRACTS the sun * I was so excited about this product and ran to get it when it dropped.   I broguht it on my honeymoon with me two years ago, and I can still bring back the taste in my memory.   As I sweat, this transferred EVERYWHERE.   In my eyes (I didn't even use it on my face),  onto my drink straws (everything tasted like this sunscreen when I wore it.). I also had to get rid of a cover up because the oil residue transferred and stained it.   I was so disappointed because I usually love this brand. * I was really excited about this product. I applied generously and every 40 minutes like the directions. No water or anything. I am absolutely fried. I know oil attracts sun but i thought a 50 SPF product would do something. Extremely disappointing with how expensive. I do like the face product! Although now weary of its potentcy. Have not found out as i keep my face shielded anyways. * This product smells amazing and I'm sure does great on the sunscreen portion but as for the ""glow"" or ""iridescence"" this product just leaves your skin looking greasy. There is no simmer or sparkle to it. * This product worked well for me. I am white like casper and i usually turn red in the sun. I appiled a good amount and my tan was so nice. I cleaned my hands on my legs and i could see my finger marks lol i only appiled twice while out in the sun. Smells great too!"

Love the guava mango scent! I used this while paddle boarding on the lake in my bikini all day in 100° temps. I reapplied once mid day and no sunburn! I use self tanner but this was my first big day in the hot summer sun. * I love Coola sunscreen. The spray applies well. I bought the travel size since I was going on vacation and only bringing a carry on and the regular size would be too big. I was a tad disappointed that these did not last the entire week. My husband and I were the only ones using the spray and we brought 2 new travel bottles with us, but they only made it to about 2/3 of the vacation. It would be nice if there was a TSA approved size that could go a little further. Besides that though, it had a good application that lasted well and as always, I love the scent. * Its an anazing product. Snells anazing, and definitely fets the job done. My only negative is that its a chemical sunscreen. Great for occational use, but not a daily summer sunscreen bc of that. * My husband and I had the worst experience with this product today, so I ran to the reviews to see if others had a problem with it. Sure enough, others mentioned that they burned badly & quickly when using this product. We spent 1 hour in overcast weather, me wearing a long sleeve hoodie, before the sun came out and we decided to wear our T shirts and SPF. We were super confused when very shortly afterwards, we were BURNED!! This wasn't the most intense sun either. I tried to protect myself & my husband with this product and it caused more harm than good. 0/10, don't even risk it. * I used this sunscreen at the beach and didnt get sunburnt at all! I have very sensitive skin and burn very badly. It was easy to apply, not greasy, and fragrance free. My only reason for giving 4 stars is the price and if you go in the water it'll wash off immediately. But I would still buy it again for another beach trip! * The smell was so strong. It smelled extremely fake, like a chemical. I couldn't try it in the store, so I tried it when I got home and returned it the next day. 
It is not something to buy because it is easy to apply. * I just bought a bottle one month ago and it's empty. I dont over spray and maybe use it every weekend. it costs to mucj to go through it so fast."

We love going to the beach and he surfs but he hated the cream sunscreen on his face and having reapply. This stick was perfect and easy to apply with zero white cast. I kept his skin protected and he didn't mind reapplying thought out the beach day. * Absolutely love this product! I wanted a clear sunscreen for my face and the product i was using was always out of stock so i bought this based on someone's review here showing how she used the stick on her shoulder and showed where she burned and didn't. It's perfect to stash in your purse, a little goes a long way, easy to apply. I will say it has a very minimal fragrance but it practically goes away as soon as you swipe it and ive had no reactions whatsoever. My new favorite! * This stick sunscreen is the best one out. I never get burned when i use this. * I travel for work and this is perfect to have on the road. Effective, no odor, smooth and non greasy * Bought this based off of the reviews here and I am so glad I did. I was looking for a sunscreen specifically for face. This was exactly what i was looking for. It's clear, not sticky, glides on smoothly, conveniently sized. I need something to quickly put on before running out the door and this makes it easy to apply all over the face and neck area. I havent used this under makeuo yet but i am sure it wouldnt be an issue since there is no residue it leaves on the skin, it is truly smooth and feels like nothing is on. The only possible con for some might be that there is a slight fragrance. It is a VERY subtle fragrance, it reminds me of Softsoap handsoap, but it does not linger by any means. It's more like once you apply it its there but vanishes within a min maybe less? It didnt cause any irritation whatsoever. * I bought this to take on a trip and i could definitely see the difference between spots that I used the stick vs missed spots. Doesn't feel greasy and I love how easy it is to carry in my purse so I can reapply more frequently. * Bought this to try a stick cause since typical cream sunscreen always ends up in my eye I sweat and causes my eyes to sting. Used it for the first time on a lake day and only applied once - my face and neck were the only two body parts that left without sunburn. It's now my go to for everyday use, glides on super smooty, doesnt leave a film, and doesnt feel heavy on your face. Okay Im done rambling now, just go buy it."

Also i usually hate wearinf oily stuff bc i have sensory issues but its not oily and dries fast. * Provides excellent protection. It has a light, clean, fresh, and fruity fragrance. It is lightweight and organic. * COOLA is one of my favorite brands so when I saw they had a 70 SPF I haf to try it. And it is now a constant staple i have. The smell is also nice not too fragramt  and not the typical sunscreen amell * I used this on just myself maybe 4 times and it was gone. For how expensive this is you do NOT get enough product. * Used this on my trip that had almost zero shade and in the pool. Kept me protected in the water and outside the water. No weird smell, It does leave a slight tint on the skin, just looks like a tan. Would 100% buy again * I really like this formula. It covers well and it's fragrant but not too heavy or greasy. It did pretty well in the water too. * I don't get much sun exposure because I like to stay indoors mostly, BUT I use this still to keep my skin young! Doesn't at all leave a greasy or sticky residue and rubs in really easily! I will say careful when spraying if you have tile or wood floors cause it'll be slippery at first but it honestly dries up pretty quickly"

Still has that kind of stiff feeling going on but I am going to try a couple other products for my face and use this on chest and arms etc. * I honestly want to love this sunscreen however the white cast it leaves is hard to deal with. I probably would have just continued using it despite the white cast because most everything els eahout it is amazing however my skin was clear and then consequently broke out after a week of using. This product is most wverything i want in a sinscreen, easy to blend, leaves you glowy, and is hydrating, while its difficult to know exactly what broke me out, ive had simular issues in the past with ceraveas sunscreens so im pretty sure thats the culprate. Its also not very high spf so maybe i wasnt applying often enough but it left me still burnt HOWEVER after applying it it will leave you looking like you havent seen the sunlight a day in your life because the white cast is so bad you just look pale. I wouldnt say dont buy this product bc theres lots of pros to it that i havent found in other sunscreens yet so honestly its a win loose with this product you just gotta pick your poison. * I figured I'd try their sunscreen since Cerave is amazing for my skin in general, but their suncare line is not for everyone. It didnt blend seemlessly as the bottle advertised, and instead I looked like unfinished pottery. * I have bought SO MANY sunscreens and hope that they don't leave a white cast. As someone with colored skin I have struggled hard with finding a sunscreen that doesn't take forever to rub in or leave a whitecast. This is probably one of the best ones I have tried! It's also easy to rub on kiddo's too, especially their face. * Product was as described.  Sheer, blended in smoothly. * Tried this on recommendation. Ugh. Leaves a white cast and is basically pointless in blocking the sun. Burned the first time using it. I had been using La Roche Posay and it had prevented burns, but this did nothing to prevent the sun. All the work I've done on my skin over the winter is now for naught. * This is my all time favorite sunscreen it is my go to last step of my morning skincare rountine. I worked with all my makeup products with making my skin feel heavy. Very hydrating i use it on my face neck and tattoos. I have very sensitive combo skin w rosacea and this product works great for me!"

I have paid for this with my own money and have repurchased it a couple times the untinted and the lightest tinted shade. This replaced any foundation and looks so beautiful on my skin it is a little thickers but my extremely sensitive and roscea prone skin adores this! I never write reveiws but this product deserves all the love! * I love this product. Despite being 48, I have very good skin and I don't need much coverage if any so this formula is perfect for me. Goes on well and feels nice on the skin. Very natural but dewy finish without the stickiness. Will reorder! * I really love this sunscreen. Its a very sheer tint but perfect alone or under make up. It doesnt have a scent and dries down almost matte. Not oily at all. I got shade 2 and it lools very dark for me but blended in great! It also doesnt burn my eyes! A little pricey but worth it. I have senstive acne prone skin and have had no issues! I will probably buy shade one in the winter when im super pale but shade two is perfect with a tan * I love dime perfume so I thought I'd try their skin care. 
This looks terrible on dry skin. It cakes and flakes.
I have very light skin, but the lightest tint is basically white and looks so bad. 

Please save your money. * I really wanted to love this product. It was too dark for me and I got the medium shade and I have olive skin although it did make my skin feeling soft it was way too oily for me from the initial put on. * I have used this tinted sunscreen for 1.5-2 years and havent used anything else . I constantly re-buy this in shade 2 . If you used the original before shades 1-3 , shade 2 is the original ! I use it as my base before make up and use it on its own daily for work . Layers well and keeps my skin supple and glowy . I have never re-purchased a product like i have this one before . Highly recommend ! My skin type is dry/normal * I absolutely love this sunscreen. It goes on smoothly and improves skin texture. Great sun protection. LOVE that the ingredients are so clean!"

I feel it lacks coverage. I am not one to burn easily either. Quite disappointed. * I used this is past with no problems.  I started having some serious skin issues on my face, neck, and tops of ears- swelling, flaking, peeling, splitting, etc. Eventually ended up at an allergist getting extensive patch testing. Of the products I used that I took in for the testing (in addition to the premade allergen patches), this caused an allergic reaction and a JVN shampoo (that had been reformulated before i bought that bottle) caused a reaction.  Another mineral sunscreen did not. * My skin loves this sunscreen but it pills horribly. Ive bought several and all of them pill. If they can fix this issue then it would be worth the money in my opinion. * I started using this on friday. By sunday my skin was a little raw but I wondered if I'd just been too rough with it. By monday morning my skin was covered in a red, raw, itchy, painful rash. Feels like a super itchy chemical burn. I thought I was going crazy. Its the only thing i changed in my very gentle routine though. So I looked it up and lo and behold I'm not the only one this happened to. All these photos of people with identical issues from this product in the reviews. Needless to say this went straight into the trash. Shocking reaction from a mineral sunscreen frankly. * it's smells. * This product broke me out in an inflamed rash all over my face. I dont know what is in it or what happened but it got me bad. Dont recommend! * I love all the other GM products I use for their clean ingredients but this gave me such a terrible rash! My face is so itchy and beet red"

There was around 10 people that went and of all of us I was the ONLY PERSON to leave that beach without sunburn. 

We all applied spf at the same time, unfortunately we all forgot/neglected to reapply and we all went swimming in a lake. I am so shocked that i am not a lobster because everyone else is RED today and I'm usually the first person to burn as i am naturally very pale.

I am very happy with the results and definitely recommend it for when you're ouf in swimwear to have a nice glow. 

HOWEVER, it is greasy just so you know. But it still gets 5 stars because it works so well * I was excited to purchase this product since i have used orher products from this brand, however this one is the WORST! I have used it on a few seperate ocasions and each time i burned so badly! I reapplied constantly and there were a fee times i used it and never got wet; and yet it still didn't work! I agree with other poor reviews and also believe the oil amplified the burn. So dissapointed because i wanted to love it, but it does the opposite of protecting your skin despite having a SPF 50 protection claim. * The first few words on the back of this bottle are ""clean chemical sunscreen actives"" but this isnt a clean product if that's what you're looking for.

7 of the main ingredients come up as hazardous or harmful when it's scanned into the Yuka app. Octocrylene is an endocrine disruptor and once broken down it becomes carcinogenic, studies have found. Just an FYI this isnt exactly ""clean"".

It's also a bit greasy, you'll need to wash your hands after using it before toughing your hair or face. * Because the oil lays on thick, I think it takes a long time for it to settle in the skin, so it's easy to come off. I kept reapplying, but whenever I would switch sides tanning, I felt my skin burning. The oil probably rubbed off on my towel, and I ended up burnt. I should have gone with a spray since I think it absorbs in the skin faster since it's a lighter coat so to speak.

It seems to be that you can't sit or lay down for 20 minutes while it's being absorbed since it's really easy for it to come off. * I applied and reapplied and reapplied and i am so burnt after being at the beach for jusr a few hours that you would think I never applied any sunblock at all. My skin hurts and is radiating heat. My friend and i both feel like the oil was amplifying the sun rather than blocking it. She isnt red because she has more naturally occurring melanin than i do, but her skin is painful and tight as well. I wanted to love it like i do the rest of their products I've tried, but instead I'll be going back to normal sunblock. * I was so happy I found an oil with spf as I usually use coco oil but wanted something with better protection for vacation. I wore this for hours bathing in the sun and didnt burn one bit. HOWEVER, my skin erupted in tiny little bumps all over. My body skin is not sensitive and I was extremely surprised and disappointed since Supergoop is so well trusted. It took days to have the bumps go away and in certain areas i can still feel them and its been over a week. Would not recommend as it is highly irritating. * as a person who uses body oil over body lotion daily, and who has consistent problems with product pilling, I love this.  It sits on top of my other skincare without interacting.  it's a little pricey but worth it, since I cannot seem to find a similar product made by a drugstore brand.  if there was, I would buy it.

I don't use it on my face because facial oil makes my glasses fall off, but I don't see why you couldn't"

I usually don't buy body oils or any products for tanning—I'd rather stick with classic sunscreen and sun protection. I threw this in my suitcase when going to my honeymoon in Cancun and I'm so glad I did! It was moisturizing and also helped with SPF. A little goes a long way. * I'm a cancer survivor so I'm a little overzealous with my sunscreen sometimes, I've been trying to get a little better with that and so I got a bottle of this oil. In my mind I associate oil with tanning, I was an '80s baby, but I really like the way the oil makes my skin look as opposed to regular sunscreen lotion so I wanted to try them. I have worn this out several times now, one time I spent at least 8 hours in full sun and I got a very nice base tan with absolutely zero burn, not even a little redness. 

I was hoping that the scent would be a little stronger, it's actually fairly unnoticeable in my opinion. I actually prefer the scent of the other oil but I hate the packaging on that one, could we get the chardonnay oil in this bottle? 

Overall though I really like this product, it works well. * I love the classic baby oil. From the first use, i fell in love w it! Its non greasy and i didnt burn at all. I kept reapplying and got a nice tan from it. :) 
The smell is subtle and i wish they made a bigger jar! * I really like the entire Vacation line that I have tried. A little goes a long way with this oil and the SPF is perfect. I never get burned when I use it. It smells great too. * Tried it and it doesnt work, maybe for a short period of time but i wore it on a float trip and it didnt do any protecting, i reapplied multiple times but if its not water resistant being an oil whats the point in it. I guess use it if you just wanna lay out maybe but i wouldnt but again * I got this as a gift with purchse of their Classic Whip sunscreen. Wow, the smell of this is so nice! It definitely has a baby smell, so if you're not looking for that typical coconut, pineapple, etc this may be for you. It reminds me of the classic Love's Baby Soft fragrance from the 80's. This entire brand seems to capture these throwback products really well! Kudos for that! I wish there was a larger size option, but I'll definitely purchase a full size bottle. * Be sure to look at the fluid ounces before buying.  This is about the size of a cell phone.  I was expecting at least a standard size bottle. I feel stupid.  Smells good but not a good value. I've not used in sun yet.  Gotta save for a special occasion since it will last a whole 3 minutes."

I've had absolutely no experience of it burning my eyes either * This is the least greasy formula I've tried, and there's no white cast. The serum-like consistency is easy to work with compared to thicker lotions. It plays well with my silicone-based primer and tinted serum too! * I waited to review this after i used it for a while. Im not sure why people are saying it burns their eyes, i have not had that experience at all, and i sweat a lot! 

Highly recommend to all who are looking for something moisturizing and lightweight. Doesnt feel thick or greasy!!! Will definitely be repurchasing * I really like this sunscreen because it is light and moisturizing, doesn't pill, feels comfortable on my skin, and I know it protects me from UV damage. However, I cannot put it anywhere above my lower eyeline. It always runs into my eyes even if I appy it above my eyebrows, so I must use a different non-running sunscreen around eyes and on forehead and temples. It leaves a shiney finish on my oily skin which I like. It would be perfect if it did not get in my eyes. I also must shake it vigorously each time because it separates after not being used for a month. I wish it did not run into my eyes. Maybe powdering would stop it if you like to use face powder. * I haave tried so many facial
Sunscreens shd this is my go to!
Great under makeup and my dry skin feels soft all day. * I wish I had read more comments before buying because they are all correct…this stuff will burn your eyes even when you do not put it anywhere near your eyes. AND hours upon hours after applying. Honestly, I am flabbergasted at why this is but it is. Do not buy. * I love this sunscreen if im careful about not applying too close to my eyes. It sits nicely on the face and doesnt look too oily. I use a light layer of pressed powder in my t zone on top of this to combat the oil and it works pretty well. Just be super careful around the eyes, ive never had such intense burning pain in my eyes as i did when some of this accidentally got on my eyelids"

I have dry, acne prone skin & have recently started using retinoids, so spf is super important to wear now. Within days of using this, I broke out worse than I ever have in my life. It went on for days - each morning i would wake up to more pimples. Absolutely horrid product. * A lot of the reviews say it pills or leaves a white cast, but I dont notice that at all. I find if I let my moisturizer dry completely before sunsncreen and let the sunscreen dry completely before applying makeup there are no issues. The sunscreen is a bit if a thicker cream with a slight green tint to color correct. It also gives my skin a nice natural glow. It feels velvety on the skin and I will definitely rebuy! This is one of the better skin care focused sunscreens I have used and I love the acne benefits! * Using this sunscreen, I had huge issues with it stinging my eyes. I always wash my hands after applying SPF in case I rub my eyes so this did not sting from my hands. I would get random stinging sensations in my eyes throughout the day from this product, even though I avoided the eye area. Just from my natural oils around my nose and brow, the sunscreen would eventually travel to my eye and cause stinging. I would only recommend this item on the body as it is very lightweight and I just wanted to make it work. * This is an amazing product I would recommend it made my skin super soft and it took some of my acne away. * On the first hour of application it is beautiful. It does leave a white cast but it goes away. But i have long 12 shifts and overtime it peels, and my oils peek through my t zone. Does it do better than other drug store sunscreens? Yes but it needs improvement on the formula. Instead of balancing my oils, it makes it worse. * I would not buy this sunscreen again. It is greasy, heavy, and uncomfortable to wear. Most importantly it leaves an INSANE whitecast. I am already incredibly pale and struggle with redness and this did not help me solve any of my problems. Instead of decreasing redness it just made me look really white, like a piece of copy paper. It is difficult to absorb into the skin and easily pills off not much later after applying it. I have tried it over quite a few moisturizers and on clean skin and it does the same thing. I used the entire bottle and continued to have these problems the entire time. * Not a bad product when it comes to the finish. But definitely collects on the eye lids and the hair line. Would not recomment and had to return."

You have been warned! It burns so badly if even a tiny bit gets near eyes! I can not emphasize enough the pain that occurred when 1 drop of water ran into my eye. It felt like lava had run into my eye it was that bad! This was the only product I had on my face. I bought this thinking I could use it to even out my skin tone and have the sunscreen in one. The tint doesn't actually do anything to even out skin tone (I'm light to medium). The texture is thick and it takes at least 30 minutes to dry down all the way. I don't have that kind of time just to wait for sunscreen to dry. This just isn't for me. * I want to love this so much. I've used half the tube because i like the coverage and it does it's job. But EVERY SINGLE TIME i wear it, i break out. Just a few hours after application and for a day or two after. So maybe if you don't have skin orone to breakouts, it will work for you. * I love the formula and ingredients however, I do find it can feel heavy especially underneath of makeup. I noticed that my makeup doesn't last as long when I wear it either, but still can get 5ish hours of good wear. While it doesn't leave a white cast, I sometimes find the tint to be too much when I wear it on its own--I am NC12 in MAC for reference. This also has a sheen, like little fine glitter particles. I personally prefer a more natural finish on my skin and find it can look like I'm sweaty (when worn alone, without makeup). However, if you are looking for a dewy finish SPF, this is it. I will also add that it takes a bit to blend in, not bad at all, but I just noticed the difference when comparing it to my Korean chemical SPFs. Overall a good choice for those looking for a mineral, dewy SPF that has no white cast. * I have tried several different tinted sunscreens. I always run into an issue where its still purple, or its too orange, or its super greasy and I break out.
THIS product has been amazing! Its in an awesome pump container so there is no messy spilling. It rubs in super easily with my normal skincare. I personally haven't experienced any pilling. It blends into my skin without white cast or an organge hue (black girly here btw). Its not greasy at all and my skin has yet to break out. I love it! * Had high hopes for this, since my usual holy grail face sunscreen had it's formula changed. 
I am not super fair, but this really looked orange on me. The texture was okay, a little tacky on the skin, probably would not work under makeup. Plus side, I have super sensitive skin and this did not break me out! * Jen Phelps recommended this on a survey she did on mineral sunscreens!  This sunscreen does great with makeup application or wear by itself'. No white cast!  Doesn't break me out or cause any allergic reaction!  Jen was spot on with her evaluation!  Plus it's so affordable!  If you go in the water you will need a water resistant sunscreen for protection from UVA/UVB rays!  Hope this help!  I have mature skin and this is my favorite after
Using sun protection my entire adult life! * Youtuber Jen Phelps recommended this product as one of her favs, she was right, so glad I tried this tinted sun screen. it is a light formula, spreads easily and evenly without burning my eyes. layers perfectly under makeup. I will definitely be buying again."

You can use it anywhere, and even on the face it doesnt break me out. It smells nice and is so easy to toss in a bag and reapply as needed. The glitter is something I dont mind, but my bf is not a fan! If they came out with a shimmer/clear version, it would appeal to a lot of people! Overall it lasts for a long while and I will repurchase. * This is a pretty product, but the large glitter chunks are just not for me at all. If you want people to be able to see visible glitter flakes on your body, you might like this. Maybe good for a festival or something.

I prefer a more pearly glow like the liquid version of this product. I would never use this on the face. It does glide on really nicely though. * Great spf for travel or beach/pool days. Leaves skin dewy and sparkly and absorbs pretty well and has a nice scent… So, listen to the reviews! It does has large chunks of glitter flakes. It will be noticeable on the skin. However, I've been using this for the past few days on my face and I like it. Be careful applying to close to the eye area because it can burn… Has a nice light tropical scent. * This stuff is so pretty on the skin and effective! This is part of my daily routine. I put it on mu chest / arms and its very comfortable and long lasting. I wore it out in the pool for 2+ hours (im very very fair skinned) and i did not burn. This product gives me the perfect glow. Due to the heavy oils and glitter, i would not put this on my face, but it's beautiful elsewhere. * not greasy, not too glowy, feels lightweight, overall great product! but that glitter is pretty big AND it sticks a lot - even after a shower it was still there, so just be aware if that bothers you! * I use this as a cute little add on after my thicker SPF creams. The glitter adds a cute glow and its perfect for reapplying throughout the day."

It blends in so well without feeling sticky or gross. Blends in completely clear. And NO SMELL. this is my new go to daily body sunscreen, im so happy i found it. * I had high hopes. But it left a weird film on my skin and rub off in clumps. Even after re-applying several times I still got severely sunburnt. * I was hesitant to try this because of some of the negative reviews, especially the reviews that mention a bad smell; however, I'm happy to report that mine has ZERO smell. It has a fairly lightweight consistency and blends onto the skin seamlessly. There is a slight tacky feel, and I noticed that when I rested my elbows on surfaces in my car, a grease spot was left behind - this is the reason I took off 1 star. Yet overall, this is a nice product that I'd definitely recommend. I also appreciate the fact that it's free of coconut oil! * This is my go-to for my tattoos and I've been using it for about 3 or 4 years now. There is no white cast, and it makes my tattoos (all black and gray) pop! I can truly attest to the sun protection, as once I missed a spot and could see a very clear, visible pink patch with a hard line differentiating from where the protection was! I also use this on my daughter who has sensitive skin and eczema, and it seems to be going okay. 

Fragrance-free means no added frangrance—so it smells like a natural sunscreen, which I don't mind. But I see some people complaining about that…

If you're looking for excellent sun protection, especially for tattoos, I HIGHLY recommend this product! * Dries quickly and invisible on skin. Leaves a somewhat velvety texture, but feels very light and not sticky. Good amount of product for the price. I had high hopes due to positive reviews about no cast and fragrance-free (I'm very sensitive to scents). I have to wear/reapply sunscreen a lot for medical reasons, so I'm very picky and this one checks almost every box. 

However, it has a horrible chemical-y smell, sort of like plastic? I actually thought it was just from the container and would disappear after drying, but even hours later, I could still smell it on my skin. It's not super strong, but I wear sunscreen on legs, arms and face and reapply frequently, so it's noticeable.

I'll try to use it up because it's so pricey, but definitely will not be repurchasing. Really disappointing because it's wonderful otherwise! Probably good for a beach day, sports, etc. Just not for everyday. * I wanted an everyday spf for my body during the upcoming spring/summer months and I loved the idea of this sunscreen. I especially loved the ingredients and fragrance free aspect. Unfortunately, as other customers reviewed - it does indeed have a scent. I was not too crazy about the scent so I returned it. It's not a fruity or sweet smell, more of a chemical scent which was light but I could smell on my arm especially if my arm was near my face. 
PRO: it does rub in very nicely, no white cast (I'm tanned), not greasy. * Ill preface with this- I am a pale white lady, so I cannot trally speak to if it truly causes a cast. I have not noticed one personally.
I really like how smoothly and quickly this rubs in. And it doesn't smell. Its my daily go to for my body before heading out for the day. The only downfall ive found is that it's pricey."

I spritzed it into the sink the first time to prime the pump, but there was still leakage and over-spray that dripped onto my clothes while applying it to my face. It didn't dry clear and left very noticeable marks on my shirt. * Really like this.  No greasy feeling. * I suffered all day with irritated burning eyes after using this product. * This suncreen spray is very oily. The directions state that you can apply over makeup but I would not recommend that, it will have you looking like a glazed donut & your makeup just might slide off. The coola makeup setting spray is a better option if you are looking for something that does not make your face oily. It does feels a little drying but its better then the mist. * I did not expect it to have such a strong alcohol like scent to it. It makes sense as it is quick drying, but the smell was off-putting to me. * So this product did prevent me from getting sunburned while I had on a full face of makeup. HOWEVER this spray left me a shiny, greasy mess which accentuated all of my texture. It did not disrupt my makeup, but it did make my makeup look worse. * It doesnt feel greasy but it looks greasy. Probably better for dry skin. Im more oily. Makes me look terribly shiny i dont like that. Easy to use and i do like how it feels"

I love the clear formula and how easy it is to apply with absolutely no white cast. It really nice as a primer also. Gifted by Murad * This is a clear sunscreen and very easy to apply. It has a scent but its not overbearring. The only thing is it leaves my skin so oily and slippery. I have combonation skin and this takes about an hour to set and feel ""dry"". * I have dry skin and this literally makes my face feel like an oil slick! Its clear so no cast but if using the correct amount it literally just slides all over my skin and takes almost 2 hours for it to not feel so slick. I will finish it to see if the vitamins make a difference but the texture is awful * It is by far the best defensive move I've made to protect my skin. My skin feels BETTER at the end of the day and I work in a very dusty dehydrating place. I have sensitive mature dry skin and this acts like a shield ALL day!!! I'm so glad I took a chance on this one! * This is hands down the best sunscreen I've ever used. It is suitable for all skin types and works great under makeup as a primer. Love this stuff! * This goes on clear so no white cast and very buildable if I want to add makeup but also blurring if I dont * ive tried out this new murad sunscreen recently and It is clear so it doesnt leave a white cast which is great.

It would burn my eyes but I tried to minimize that by not putting it anywhere close to my eyes. However by the end of the day it somehow got i my eyes without fail and made them burn so bad. The first time I used it i was at the beach and had to go home early because i could barely open them from it getting in my eyes. I also delevloped dry skin. I didnt realize it was the sunscreen becuause it felt hydrating. Well the second ingredient is alcohol. So explains the eye irritation and the skin dryness. I stopped using it recently and my dry skin has almost gone away. I would NOT recommend this product. * This is my favorite spf! It feels like a moisturizer and doesn't make me feel like I have a gross film/residue on my face which is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to sunscreen. I have oily prone/acne prone skin and it also doesn't make me look/feel greasy which I like! While it looks cool on my counter, the packaging shape isn't the most functional and makes me scared that I'm not getting out all of the product. other than that I really like this! * I was on the hunt for a better face sunscreen.

My skin looks and feels better than ever, even after all the sun damage I did to it over the years (I am a 60's baby who was a teenager in the 70's when we did not know what SPF was and chose sunscreen by smell, I did not do the Crisco or baby oil and iodine crazingness). It is amazing how moisturized my skin looks when I put it on, which is daily. The skin on my legs and arms look like they did 30 years ago plus I have the bonus of SPF50! The dry old lady skin on my legs and arms is gone! I would recommend this product to everyone I know no matter what there age is! * Ordered this because I use body wash with AHA and havent been protecting my skin. Got the smaller size to try it out. So far, I like it but it has a noticeable scent. Almost like honey. It may say this in tje ingredients but I was thrown off because there other products are scentless or has a sunscreen smell.

It fades with time but wouldnt be weird if you were layering scents and the honey stayed around"

I think brands should be more transparent about informing their customers that they're actually buying a different product than what they're used to. The consistency of the new cream is thicker and harder to spread, but what stands out the most to me is the smell: somewhere in between Play-Doh and generic baby sunscreen. My partner has sensitive skin around his eyes, and the old formula didn't cause him any burning, but the new one does. I wouldn't buy this again. * I bought this because it had avobenzone but no octocrylene (at the time). Great texture but I reacted badly to something in it. Guessing it was the algae because I've used the other ingredients before without issue. * DO NOT BUY new formula is horrible. Not the same product whatsoever. Why ruin a great product everyone loved?? Makes no sense. Ive gone through at least 10 of these moisturizers and now i will no longer purchase. And the new scent is a crime against humanity. * This used to be SOOOO awesome.  Now my face oily by 10 am and feels very irritated.  Also broke me out for the first time in a while.  Had zero issues with the old formula.  I really hope they change it back * What a great and rich sunscreen! The texture of this is super rich and hydrating while feeling so comfortable on my skin. I love that it doesn't leave a white film over my skin, it just soaks right in. Gifted by Supergoop * This was my holy grail of moisturizers with sunscreen for years. It kept my skin hydrated without making it greasy, had no scent, played well with any eye cream I paired it with and never broke me out. Since the formula change, this has given me nothing but problems.
First is the scent. IT REEKS. It smells like a burning pit and the smell does NOT dissipate. I am super sensitive to scents and the old formula had a slight smell to it but you didn't notice it after you put it on.
Next, the consistency is now a bit chalky and not as creamy as it used to be.
Lastly, the hydration is gone. My skin is dry about 45 minutes after I put this on. Now, that could be mostly due to my skin hating the new formula, so take this as you will.
I hate that I have to stop using this. It was a decent price and worked well for me which can be hard to come by, but I'll sadly have to give it up."

Originally I was apprehensive about the price (especially since it was my first time trying it) BUT it spreads well with a small amount, it's a decent size, it has just the right amount of shimmer and it absorbs into the skin quickly so once it's applied, you'd immediately forget it's even there if it didn't make you sparkle. Honestly, no complaints about it personally. However, if you have oily skin that breaks out easily and you plan to use it, whether on your face or body, I would be conscious of that given that it's an oily substance rather than a lotion. * Love the way it smells, but It doesn't apply as easy as you'd think, it's a thicker consistency and i feel like you need to apply allot * This has either 0 SPF or ATTRACTS the sun * I was so excited about this product and ran to get it when it dropped.   I broguht it on my honeymoon with me two years ago, and I can still bring back the taste in my memory.   As I sweat, this transferred EVERYWHERE.   In my eyes (I didn't even use it on my face),  onto my drink straws (everything tasted like this sunscreen when I wore it.). I also had to get rid of a cover up because the oil residue transferred and stained it.   I was so disappointed because I usually love this brand. * I was really excited about this product. I applied generously and every 40 minutes like the directions. No water or anything. I am absolutely fried. I know oil attracts sun but i thought a 50 SPF product would do something. Extremely disappointing with how expensive. I do like the face product! Although now weary of its potentcy. Have not found out as i keep my face shielded anyways. * This product smells amazing and I'm sure does great on the sunscreen portion but as for the ""glow"" or ""iridescence"" this product just leaves your skin looking greasy. There is no simmer or sparkle to it. * This product worked well for me. I am white like casper and i usually turn red in the sun. I appiled a good amount and my tan was so nice.

I consider it an average option. * I like this sunscreen for the way it makes my skin feel. It doesn't freak me out, and I feel moisturized when I put it on. That being said, it does have a white cast, even on my very fair skin. Additionally, I noticed that if I put makeup over top, it's a disaster.

The scent is okay & it makes me feel greasy but because of that it does leave a nice sheen, which i like. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product. In fact, i think its very dangerous that they are advertising this as spf 50 when the sun protection didnt help me at the beach. I was surprised to find out how burnt i got because i was also hanging out in my beach tent for majority of the day. For those who have a history of skin cancer or concerned about it, i would stay away from this. * Great SPF. Vacation makes an excellent line of products. My husband puts this on everytime he goes deep sea fishing and it works. * Smells great and isnt sticky or thick, i wish the scent was a little stronger though * Works well if you don't plan on going into water. Otherwise it needs reapplied, which makes the product get used up fairly quickly."

Ill continue to use and reccomend if anyone i know is looking for a solid face stick * I took a chance on this because I couldn't find Coola's stick sunscreen. Reviews all looked good. Wow. Just WOW. It goes on thick and white. Seriously, if you're going to a costume party and don't have white face paint, this is the perfect dupe. My daughter has incredibly fair skin and this was so white it wouldn't even blend in to look less ridiculous. Remember how lifeguards would put zinc oxide on their noses? This is that level of coverage and appearance. 

On a positive note, I then purchase Sun Bum 50spf for kids. It's clear, smells amazing and works great too. * Brought this hoping it would work as well as the supergoop stick but does not. Definitely leaves a white cast in person and pictures. Would not recommended. * Definetly needs to be rubbed in after applying. But other then that it works great!"

This blended easily on my sensitive skin, didn't get clumpy or anything. I blended in a little extra with my fingers to try and cover the white residue just a bit. It was even easy to put a bit on my kids shoulders in a hurry. * Loooove this stick so much!! I'm a huge fan of supergoop products- I own several already but I love this one just as much for its portability and ease of application. It's hands-free and my kids and apply it themselves plus it fits in y belt bag! Gifted by supergoop * This is a great sunscreen. I love that it is a stick making it super travel-friendly.

It's a gel texture, and it feels like nothing on your skin. seems to work well against sunburn with the kids outside all day long. * Even at only 30 SPF this is my favourite suncare item. The texture is amazing and smells so good. Doesn't leave a white cast and is very moisturizing as well. * I just received this in the mail today so I've only used it the one time so far. I'll start with the scent. It definitely smells like a sun care product. It's not overpowering at all. The consistency is great. It's a nice gel/cream and you don't need much to cover an area.

I can't put this anywhere near my eyes or they burn and water like crazy. It's unfortunate because this checks all my other boxes. Moisturizing, works well with retinols/retinoids, inexpensive, good packing, didn't irritate my eczema/make me break out, etc. If you don't have sensitive eyes, this would probably be great for you. * First time trying this product, previously used Cetaphil Oil-Absorbing moisturizer. Consistency is good (creamy texture); no white cast. Giving it 4-stars because the pump is horrible and I've had to remove pump to get product out. * I love the product for the convenience of having moisturizer and sunscreen in one bottle, but it comes at a cost that has me not using it as often as I otherwise would. First, it remains pretty visible on skin - no white cast, but it does leave me looking visibly greasy in a way that other moisturizers and even some sunscreen doesn't. This is a non-issue if I am wearing makeup over it, but having to put makeup on takes away from the convenience. The other issue is that it starts coming off my face after 12-16 hours of being on. Once it hits that point, it inevitably ends up stinging my eyes. As long as I put it on late in the morning and wash my face as soon as I get home from work, it is fine but if that is not an option I find myself reaching for something else. * I bought this product and found that my skin felt Hester after only one use. * I was looking for a new SPF and this had good enough reviews to give it a try. I absolutely love it. I have oily skin and this combined with a finishing powder leaves me oil free all day.

It does protect from the sun, so it does the job, but I would not buy again. * I am not sure if I maybe got a bad batch but I bought this and every time I use it on my face, it inevitably begins running down my face and gets in my eyes. Recently went tubing on the river with friends and had to keep my eyes COMPLETELY SHUT for two hours because I couldn't try and wash it out with river water and we had run out of bottled water. I use it on my body now but the consistency of the product isn't great; it's super oily. I normally love Neutrogena skin products but this was a no from me :( * Burns burns burns * I was looking for a new sunscreen and happened to pick this up. It has a very creamy consistency. I don't know if I got a bad batch because the first time I applied some liquid came out with it. Even with shaking before applying, the sunscreen was still very shiny. It felt VERY wet on my face but this feeling did go away after a few minutes of wearing it. I have noticed that I've broken out a little more and that some of the acne has lasted longer than they normally do after I added this to my routine. Also, the sunscreen has a very orange tone to it. I'm cool toned and I don't know if I'm just seeing things but I noticed a slight difference in skin tone between the second and third picture after rubbing it in. I didn't notice sensitivity to my eyes when I was using this, so that's good! I'll probably be finishing this up as a body sunscreen. I'd say that if you have drier skin, aren't acne-prone, and have a warmer undertone this would probably work better for you than me! * After about 20 mins this sunscreen burns my eyes, even after wiping it off it burns…. would not reccomend * Pros: peach colored = no white cast on skin, goes on smoothly, very spreadable, seems to last, doesn't clog pores

Cons: cannot apply to eye area because product spreads throughout the day and gets into eyes and burns * I dont mind scents really and actually enjoy when something smells good. But this was strong. Its a very strong floral scent. Like it doesnt go away and you smell it when you move. If you get too close to your eyes it can burn. It did blend in nicely and was very moisturizing. But it doesnt seem to dry down at all. Too moisturizing for me as i was very shiny. Bordoeline greasy.  It did look good under makeup. I would suggest for very dry skin if you dont mind heavy scents. But theres better options imo."

This SPF is perfect for this dreadful Texas humidity and heat. It's very lightweight, non-greasy, and has a pleasant scent. Reapplying is a breeze since the product doesn't build up on the skin or cause a film. It's very breathable and works well with general skin sensitivities. The size is quite large for travel, but still small enough to throw in your beach bag and still have space for other necessities. It has a click-locking spray top so it doesn't accidentally spray in your bag. I will say that if your skin is very dry, you may want to go for a cream SPF because this does not provide much moisture. This is definitely made for hot, sunny summers. I love it and I know for sure I am buying a full-sized bottle to keep on hand.

***This review was collected as part of a promotion.*** * As a professional in the beauty industry, I've learned firsthand the  importance of sun protection, making COOLA's  spray an indispensable asset. In an industry where skincare is very important, COOLA stands out with its dedication to not only protecting against harmful UV rays but also enhancing the overall experience of sun care.

COOLA's sunscreen spray doesn't just shield your skin from UVA and UVB rays; Its broad-spectrum protection ensures comprehensive coverage, safeguarding against both premature aging and potential skin damage. As someone deeply invested in skin health, I love COOLA's commitment to providing a product that protects and cares for my skin.

The scent of Piña Colada fragrance is delicious. Gone are the days of sunscreen smelling like, well, sunscreen. Instead, COOLA's tropical scent transports me to my last vacation. It's a big change from the clinical smell of traditional sunscreens, making the application process a sensory experience.

I did not have any issue in my delicate skin but I always recommend  a patch test.

In my personal opinion, COOLA's in spray isn't just a sun protection product; it's an  evolution of skincare. With its comprehensive protection, anti-aging benefits, and irresistible Piña Colada scent, COOLA has redefined what it means to stay safe in the sun. So, whether I am lounging by the pool or hitting the beach, I make COOLA my go-to companion for summer adventures. And a big pus smells delicious! * The COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a delightful sun protection experience. Its tropical scent evokes visions of sunny beaches and relaxation, enhancing the application process with a touch of indulgence. The organic formula boasts SPF 30, providing reliable protection against both UVA and UVB rays, crucial for preventing sunburn and long-term skin damage. What sets this sunscreen apart is its lightweight texture, which absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue. This feature is particularly appealing for those who dislike the heavy feeling often associated with sunscreen application. The spray mechanism ensures effortless and even coverage, making it convenient for reapplication throughout the day, especially during outdoor activities. Furthermore, the use of organic ingredients adds to its appeal for those who prioritize natural  products. 

 In conclusion, the COOLA Piña Colada Classic Body Organic Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 offers a luxurious and effective sun protection solution for those who appreciate both quality and indulgence in their routine. * As a licensed Esthetician, we our taught early on how important using SPF to protect our skin. This aerosol is easy to use and smells amazing! If you have sensitive skin I would recommend spraying into your hands first then applying. I did have a slightly burning feel when I sprayed directly. But, overall I really love how cute and small and effective this spf is to use. My skin adapted the more I used this spf. * I love this sunscreen! Its perfect for travel and smells great. I used it almost all up on my recent vacation. It smells likea tropical holiday on a beach with a coconut. I would definetly recommend. I know the spf is quality and better packaged and easily portable. * This review was collected as part of a promotion. My name is Michele and I'm a Beauty Expert in my early 30's with fair combination skin. As the weather gets warmer, I have to make sunscreen a priority in my skincare routine. I am absolutely loving the Coola Clear Spray Body Sunscreen SPF 30 Piña Colada Sunscreen. I love its yummy, natural Piña Colada scent. It takes me away on a vacation to my favorite beach. This is a non-aerosol sunscreen that is so easy to spray onto your skin. It has a lightweight, lighter than air, mist texture that absorbs so quickly into my skin without leaving any greasy residue. I got the chance to try the full size 6 fluid ounce version of this spray sunscreen. This sunscreen is formulated with at least 70% Organic Ingredients. You get broad spectrum SPF 30 UVA and UVB protection. This sunscreen has water resistance that lasts up to 80 minutes so you can enjoy more time in the sun and water without worrying about reapplying every hour. With this amazing sunscreen you not only protect your skin but keep it hydrated too. Plant Protection is formulated with antioxidant rich nutrients which help fight free radicals, hydrates and nourishes your skin barrier too. Safflower Oleosomes is plant derived encapsulation technology that makes this formulation even more effective. Spray this sunscreen on your skin 15 minutes before any sun exposure. Make sure to reapply this sunscreen every 80 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone of any age who loves the sun and wants to have lightweight, long lasting and fast absorbing sun protection that also keeps your skin hydrated too. * Sun care is very important because it can help prevent skin cancer. I can't stress enough how important it is to wear sunscreen everyday. I was looking for a new everyday sunscreen and I think I found it. I prefer spray sunscreen than a cream so this one is perfect. It smells absolutely amazing and I love it! With most sunscreens they can get really heavy and greasy. I was really pleased that it absorbs really well on the skin and doesn't leave a layer of oil behind. Another thing I like is the ingredients, because I was having a hard time finding sunscreens that didn't have harsh or harmful ingredients. The Coola brand has organic and vegan ingredients so no worries about having harmful chemicals being absorbed in your body. So far so good and I would repurchase it."

It doesn't break me out and it blends in nicely! * so guys just buy it no white cast,affordable,and gives u that clear skin look😎 * I'm an adult but this sunscreen is my ultimate favorite. It doesn't break me out, has SPF 50, and lasts soooooo long!
I use this every single day. I took this on my 2 month European trip and wore this for my main protection. It didn't sweat off in the humidity and it didn't make me a greaseball on top of the sweat I was dripping. One bottle lasts me a minimum of 6months with exclusive, daily use on the face.
There is no cons. It's affordable, does what it claims, and is nice on the skin (bare or under makeup). I highly recommend this for everyone for any parts of the body."

Infused with vitamin C, it offers effective sun protection without causing breakouts. The lotion leaves a slightly shiny finish but doesn't make the skin oily, making it a great base for foundation. Highly recommended for its lightweight feel and skin-friendly formulation. * Goes in clear which is great fir those ""no makenup days"" 
Very hydrating and gives my skin a nice glow. I wear in the summer time and my face always feels protected. 
Id tou are jot into the glowy/dewey look, id recommend a diffrent product! * I really like this sunscreen! It absorbs very quickly, lightweight, and help controls my oil production throughout the day. I still have to blot my face in the afternoon, but it helps. I also like to use a water base moisturizer underneath :) 
PLEASE NOTE* a little goes A LONG WAY! 
Your face will be a grease pit if you put too much on, learned the hard way. * I dont get why some people love the ""dewey"" effect because at least on me, when I put this sunscreen on, it felt like I just spent the day frying stuff in the kitchen and all sweaty, right after my shower! It went straight to the trash can. * This sunscreen reminded me of a drugstore formula, not something I'd expect from Shiseido. It has an oily, sticky texture - not like your typical Shiseido sunscreen or a clear sunscreen like Supergoop. It's greasy, doesn't absorb well, and it stings the eyes terribly like a poorly-formulated budget buy. I really dislike it and will be returning it."

Doesnt make my face break out and provides SPF * I love this!  it's a mineral sunscreen for face that truly goes on clear.  It has a beige tint til applied.  It adds a natural glow and makes skin look beautiful.   Perfect for mature skin.The expiration date (on the box and tube) isn't always great - 5 months.  The tube leaks into the cap, so I store mine with the tip upward. 
it's spf30, so it's efficacy is 2 hours - so reapply.   I highly recommend this for a mineral sunscreen. * It's lightweight and easy to wear but I dont feel like it protects me enough from the sun. I feel like I need to apply so much for it to work. Plus it's very small for the price. * The first bottle i bought was perfect. The sunscreen is incredible and makes you look so glowy. Doesnt break me out. I didnt have an issue with the bottle leaking. I just bought a second bottle and it is just not travel friendly at all. Half of it spilled in my toiletry bag. Id love for the packaging to get fixed so its not leaky but the product itself is top notch. Only sunscreen id ever use on my face * I do like this. It has a slight tint that when applied it's hardly noticeable but sunscreen seems a little drying but not as much as some other tinted sunscreens that I""ve tried. Would buy this again. * I find this sunscreen perfect for sitting under makeup or wearing it alone. * This sunscreen has Butyloctyl Salicylate, a cousin to octisalate, and a chemical UV absorber. That's how they can get a higher SPF with such a low concentration of Zinc or TO. So it isn't purely mineral. I like it and use it, but I wish they wouldn't market it as 100% mineral when it has unregulated chemical UV absorbers in it."

I switched to this from the CeraVe facial moisturizing lotion with SPF for a higher coverage and mineral. After about a month, my entire face was broken out, from my forehead line, temples, cheeks, chin, and jaw, all red under the skin bumps that were super itchy. Even though it's an otherwise clean product, make sure to spot test this a few times before buying! * I really wanted to like this sunscreen, especially because of the protection from blue light. However, this product isn't for me. It takes quite a while to rub in, and a white cast is still inevitable. It also feels greasy after a few hours of wear. I wish Ulta would restock the Jack Black sunscreen I have come to love over the years! * I tried the blue lizzard Sheer Mineral Sunscreen Lotion for Face SPF 50+ and I was very impressed. It is very lightweight and goes on sheer. I have very dry skin and most mineral sunscreens leave my skin uncomfortably dry after 2 hours. This is not the case with the blue lizzard sunscreen. I am able to wear it and reaply without my skin feeling uncomfortable. This is a great product for the price. * When applying the proper amount, it does leave a white cast on brown skin. But feels great on skin * I was recommended by a dermalogist to use blue lizard. I have dark brown spots.I have been using this product for over 6 years. I have noticed a difference on my face. * I've heard nothing but good things about this brand and when I ran out of my current face sunscreen, I decided to try this one. I love that it's an SPF50. That's honestly the only positive thing I can say about this sunscreen. It comes out pretty runny, but it's the consistency of Elmer's Glue and I imagine that this is exactly what it would feel like if you tried to rub glue into your face. On top of being difficult to apply, it leaves a horrible white cast. This one was a miss for me. * Works incredibly well. Mild scent, but liquidy. Does take a little longer to rub in because of the consistency. However, it works! My son had a small pink spot after a full day of sun on his face. A little after suncare and the next day the pink spot was gone. Highly recommened"

It comes out of the bottle a little watery and then feels like silk as your rubbing it into your skin.  I love that this has a high SPF than most facial sunscreens. * If you've ever tried the Supergoop invisible sunscreen, this is practically the same thing for HALF the cost! Though highly raved about, I personally never enjoyed the Supergoop formula because the heavy silicone texture was off-putting and did nothing for my dry skin. It just felt like I was wearing a slippery silicone mask all day. I prefer dewy SPF lotions for this reason. They provide hydration and protection all in one. However, I love Sun Bum sunscreens so I still wanted to give this a try! The term ""gel"" is slightly misleading because it makes you think of a cooling gel consistency which this is not. This is definitely that same silicone texture, but the formula has a more hydrating quality to it. The silicone base gives it a mattifying texture which makes it invisible on the skin. The more exciting part: this is weightless and DOES NOT BURN THE EYES! I have yet to find a single U.S. chemical sunscreen that doesn't burn my eyes into oblivion. I don't know how this formula would hold up on the beach or under extreme sweating/activity, but I fully recommend (as it's advertised) for daily wear or under makeup. Sun Bum is killing it! * This is hands down the best-looking sunscreen I've ever tried.  Unlike other gel sunscreens, this one doesn't pill. * This contains coconut oil as one of the first ingredients.  If you are easily acne prone and/or prone to clogged pores stay away.  Coconut oil is HIGHLY comedogenic.  It would be nice if they created a facial sunscreen that is noncomedogenic. * I used sunscreen everyday. Feels good under makeup! It almost has a matte feeling - sorta like a primer. Definitely not the average face sun CREAM. Gel is in the name, gel is exactly the consistency! I would buy again! * It does not smell good. Especially vs all of their other products. Left a very oily/greasy sheen behind. Ended up taking it back."

I think I got a bad batch because I haven't heard someone else complain of the smell. The texture and prime this product has is just so incredible though ;( * I love the formula, been using years, but Beekman said they were fixing the pump bottle years ago but it still seems same. It needs to just go in a squeeze bottle or dropper. No matter how much or often you shake this, product gets jammed up in pump and splatters when it comes out, with chunks. I almost want to buy a new one and transfer the entire contents to another vial with roller balls in it. * I have very oily dkin. I was given this as a gift from my mom, snd im on my third bottle. This is incredible snd i wadnt expecting this to be this goid. Its so lightweight and feels so good on the skin. Its non greasy and absorbs quickly. Love that it has SPF. Best part…. It controls my oil throughout the entire day!!! Im legit obsessed with this product snd im so geatful my mom has me try this. I just purchased another bottle yesterday. 10/10 * Too watery and it literally expired 3 months after I got in a mystery bag * This product is fantastic under makeup (but i would not wear on its own) and I have repurchased maybe 4-5 times now. but omg. This is the worst bottle pump I have ever encountered. It splatters, it clogs, and no two pumps are ever the same amount. The pump is so bad that I am on the hunt for a new primer as a whole. Seriously. Fix the pump. * I absolutely adore this product as a primer, it works great with the loreal true match tinted serum. However, for the love of whoevwr is out there, change the pump. Out of 6 bottles, i had ONE that worked well and didnt spray every where. Seriously. Get it together. Get a new pump. It is bad enough that I am looking for a different product all together * I bought the travel size primer to try along with all of my other Beekman skincare favorites. I only used it a handful of times and every pump since has been watery and thin making it hard to apply evenly. I standby every other Beekman product I've purchased but this one foesnt make the cut."

Recently went on a beach vacay.  I used this product throught the day. I could pull it out of my bag and quickly get my SPF protection with a clean clear light mist. It was cooling as well which was a great plus in the hot climate.  A light tropical scent that dissipates quickly. So glad i had this. Works great. I would definitely encourage others to purchase if just for the ease of use. I sprayed over makeup too.

I have used old variant without any mint/acai and i loved that one. So trusting the brand, i bought the one with Mint this time.
One application of this Lip Balm (mint) and I end up having horrible allergic reaction.
My lips are burning, swollen, extremely dry, red, itchy. Wish I could add an image.
Hoping it clears soon, its been 3 days now. It pains while eating and even smiling.
Save yourself! * it doesnt taste bad at all, especially being an spf lipbalm. i love it, but the big box for an average sized product is kinda… meh. * It feels great on the lips. It's not sticky. It also smell good. What I hated was that it taste like sunscreen. I understand it's sunscreen balm but I just couldn't  love it. It taste like was eating sunscreen. * I was looking for a lip product with SPF for the summer months and running outside. I love the flavor and texture of this product, and it is very moisturizing. I do with it was slightly thicker so it would stay on a bit longer. * extremely moisturizing, the acai one tastes mostly like sunscreen but the point of the product is sun protection not yummy taste. overall really enjoy this product!"

However, if your skin is on the dryer side I wouldn't recommend. I even used it on my young son while on vacation in FL and his poor face was also very dry. * Nice that you can put it on over your makeup and it doesn't feel heavy * It does what it says, you barely feel it on your skin and works very well. I have sensitive skin and this didn't irritate it at all. Favorite part was that it wasnt greasy at all. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars its pricey for the size. * So i love how this feels in my skin. I can feel it, but it doesn't look greasy. Does make my make up more prone to smudging when im setting it which is annoying. Smudges when i apply over make up which is annoying, but perhaps wouldn't be so noticeable on lighter make up days. * This js a great sunscreen stick. Does not break me out (a miracle), glides over the skin without tugging, leaves make mostly intact (mostly), and feels comfortable on the skin. However - the stick is a round shape, and fairly wide. This makes it extremely difficult-to-impossible to get the stick anyway with angles or crevices. I cant get the stick to apply near my eyes and between my brows at the base of the nose. Other than that, I have nothing bad to say about this product. Highly recommend! * I burn very easily but love the sun. Every other face sunscreen I have tried eventually makes my combo skin too oily…and I've tried dozens of different brands. 

This glides on easily, doesn't feel greasy and I don't burn at all. There is a light barrier left on the face after application, which I don't mind. Much better for me than lotion or serum type sunscreen that eventually turns to grease on my face. Bonus points for not being a liquid, which makes it perfect for flying. Worth the trip to a local Ulta given that it's been sold out online for a while. * I love the unseen for my face and i was so hyped when they came out with a body version but in application that one was way too oily for someone like me who uses it when im outside working and sweating. But this? THIS!? Perfect for applying on tattoos (which i have) and its not oily. The viscosity of this is perfect if you're like me and really only show your arms. It obviously works since my tattoos haven't felt like they're about to burn off now."

Only con is that it'll leave white stains all over your clothes and other belongings. You have to wait about 30 minutes after applying for it to fully absorb and not leave stains. If you have the time to wait then it's great! But not recommended for someone like me who rushes in the morning and doesn't like white stains. * ...than the Blue Lizard Sensitive product, same price, larger volume? I just took tubes of both on vacation. None of us could tell the difference between Sheer and Sensitive; the latter is cheaper, for le$$. I will absolutely repurchase the Sensitive formula. * Works incredibly well. Mild scent, lightiy whipped consistency. Does take a little longer to rub in because of the consistency.

Its a smooth application, non oily/greasy, AND no white cast (I have light/medium tan skin). Id definietly recommend this product if looking for a mineral suscreen that's non-comedogenic, lightly scented. * This mineral sunscreen has blown me away. It goes on so smooth, does not bead up in heat. After applying it, I don't need to use primer. Amazing product!!! * This is one of my favorite summer products. I use it alone as a skin tint - SO easy and the finish is perfect. But it is tinted to suit fair/medium skin so it's dark on me before I have a tan. Please please please make more shades!! * Not good * I feel like this is a good tinted sunscreen for those that have oily skin. It's thick but doesn't feel moisturizing at all. I live in the desert and do a super juicy skincare routine and have oily skin. Because my skin is beyond drenched, when I put this on last, that dewiness still comes through and I feel like my skin doesn't look massively oily as the day goes on. But again, I'm doing a lot of moisturizing steps before hand. If you're dry or doing light skincare, this is gunna make you look parched. It gives no coverage, but I think it tamps down my redness a little bit. I haven't tried this under makeup. The color looks dark out the tube but on me (light tan) it blends well. Darker skin will probably have a white cast. It does transfer so watch out for your clothes. My main con is the smell. It's like a citrus kitchen cleaner that's heavy on the cleaner part. Not pleasant at all. It goes away, but lordy I hold my breath until then. * My favorite sunscreen so far. I have medium - tan skin so I have a hard time finding sunscreens that dont make me look like I have unblended white on my face. This tint is perfect and not overpowering. This is great for people who want a natural look and sun protection. I dont feel greasy or oily either. * This is my everyday sunscreen. It has a slight tint which is perfect for me even with my fair skin. With this, a little spot concealer, blush, brow tint and mascara, im good for the day. I do set with a light setting powder and it wears beautifully. I purchased almost 4 times already and will continue to do so. Great product"

It flaked on my skin so bad. The first time I used it I used it on it's own and blended it with my fingers and it left flakey streaks on my face. So the second time I used my skincare first and tried to blend this in with a beauty blender and got the same results. Both times I shook the tube well according to the label and got the same results. Very sad this didn't work for me! * After putting it on for a few days (maybe 3). My skin next to my ears starting to breakout. Now anytime I put it on my skin turned hot and itchy like crazy. I love this brand and has other products from them with no issue. Not sure why my skin doesn't like this. * Non greasy sun protection that works well alone and under makeup. Does blend in with your skin color and slightly blurs skin brown spots and blemishes. * Hey Ulta, Dimethicone is a silicone. This product should not come up with your silicone free search filter. * I dont really like SPF's they break my skin out but i do love this one. I wear it under makeup and it does make my makeup a little more oily but i just add a little more setting powder to my routine and dont notice a difference. This product has great ingredients and doesnt break my skin out!! The onlt SPF i'll use * Out of all the brands I've tried through working at Ulta, Dermalogica has the BEST SPF! This one is mineral and blends right into you're skin with no white cast, which is hard to find. Esthetician approved :) * Sunscreens breakout my skin out so badly- but not this one!  Plus, it's a mineral sunscreen that isn't heavy and has ZERO white cast. I love that it softens out the appearance of my pores and lines- for no makeup days- but doesn't pill with makeup!"

No skin burning, no irritation, no strong scent. My husband and my son both work outdoors for a good portion of their jobs and they have no complaints! * Im reading a lot of reviews and honestly yall dont know how to use sunscreen. Why are you spraying it directly on your face and over your makeup. If you are using it on your face spray some in your hands and pat it of your face and also do a patch test when trying new products. Everyone skin is different. * The best sunscreen for me. * I bought this just to use to go to the beach, but the next morning my skin looked so good. I started using it daily as part of my morning routine and I get compliments all the time about my skin. I saw someone didn't like that you couldn't spray directly to the face but honestly as an oily skin girl, it really should be rubbed into the skin, otherwise it just sits on top very dewy. I am at work at 7 and normally oily by 1 but since using this, I have a nice glow but significantly less oily than I am bare faced. I also don't wear makeup to work, drink lots of water, and barely get 6 hours sleep. So I promise you it really is the sunscreen because my habits have gotten worst but my face is still improving from being acne prone and very sensitive. They make a version specifically for face I want to try. * Love this product, i spray a little in my hand and rub into my face, neck, chest and arms for an amazing glow. My coworker kept saying this is something extremely beautiful about your skin…had to share my secret lol * You will only be able to spray your full body two times with this sunscreen. Too expensive for the size."

I wear the lightest shade in NARS concealer and in Tarte BB cream and this is somehow perfect for me! Now, it does look orange in your hands when you squeeze it out but if you use a dime size amount and rub it in it gives you the perfect light tan glow! And it looks even better under makeup (just enhances my regular fair shade of foundation or concealer or BB cream) without making me look orange, streaky, or pill. I really cannot emphasize how much this product has changed the makeup/SPF game for me. It not only gives me SPF but makes me look prettier and feel more confident. It truly is such a healthy glow. I don't look like a sick Victorian child anymore lol. I've purchased this product 5 times now, and will purchase it forever. Just trust me, a dime size amount for fair girls and you'll never look back! * This sunscreen looks great under makeup. I usually put it on after my moisturizer or a moisturizing primer. Doesn't pill. * Where do I start? This is one of the best sunscreens ive tried. I can apply this around my eye area and no burning! This also gives a really pretty but subtle glow and I've noticed it just ever so slightly evens out my skin. It wears really nice under my make up. And lastly, it doesn't break me out! Ive repurchased it and would do it again. It's also one of the more affordable sunscreens which is a bonus. * Iv used so many sunscreens, this one takes the cake bc of how lightweight it feels. I also like the green one! * The only positive thing I have to say is, I love the shimmer it gives my skin. But it's just the worst sunscreen I have tried. It feels very uncomfortable on my skin. I tried it on my face and even tho it's hot and summer time it feels dry. I was going to trash this but tried it on my hands. For some reason I thought it would feel ok on my hands. I was wrong. Do not buy this, even if you think your skin is oily. * Every single time I use this SPF it pills. When it dries down, anywhere I touch my face it starts pilling. Forget about wearing makeup on top of it. * One of the only sunscreens that I've actually enjoyed wearing. Doesn't leave a white cast, doesn't break me out, and doesn't sting my eyes, and it's not horrendously expensive!"

Severe swelling, blisters, red and crusty, itchy skin. Octocrylene ingredient is known irritant apparently. Stick to mineral sunscreens. * I developed skin irritation * I'm loving this sunscreen! I've been searching for a face sunscreen that doesn't leave the dreaded white cast. I've found it. This sunscreen is a sheer, lightweight gel. It is fragrance free and absorbs into the skin quickly. It does have shea butter and coconut oil, which may be a problem for those with oily skin. * This is a great product that is comfortable to wear and won't leave a cast. If you sweat it won't run and become white. A little provides good coverage. It's scentless so it's perfect for when you wear your own scent/parfum. I am super happy with BGS * I love supporting black owned businesses especially in skin care. quite often our skin is not considered with product formulation. I would much rather spend my money with a company that's being intentional. with that said I love the clear application. never an issue with a white cast. goes well as a first layer before makeup and no pilling. 
downsides are for me as someone with combination skin and acne prone I do not do well with this sunscreen especially in the summertime. my face just kind of stays oily and greasy. for someone with dry skin or who isn't acne prone it would probably appear as a nice glow for them. for me it's just greasy and I feel like my summer breakouts never go away. so if you have the right skin type this could be a great SPF for you. if you're acne prone with combo skin I recommend to keep looking. * This sunscreen is completely clear and very effective. There is no fragrance and it is smooth going on, like a primer. Feels good to have a sunscreen without the white cast. * I absolutely love the coverage and texture of this product.  I break out easily,  so I'm hesitant to try new products on my face."

Every sunscreen on the market that says ""acne safe"" or ""non comedigenic"" still break me out.  I have VERY sensitive skin and eyes, and this bever burns or stings.  It does what it says it does.  It also does not pill under makeup.  If yoy're a dark skintone, you will HAVE to wear fou dation over this, as it does leave the normal mineral sinscreen white cast. * Its moisturizing and leaves a slight white cast for my POC folks and I havent gotten sunburnt while on it. Doesnt feel too heavy but you'll notice it on your face. No chemically smell and doesn't make my eyes sensitive. Its good under makeup. Haven't tried it in water. Great for folks with combo, dry, or normal skin types. It does what it says it does, but nothing magnanimous especially considering the price and quantity. Other sunscreens at lower price points get the job done the same, if not better. For acne prone skin, Good Molecules and Hero have good sunscreens as well. Otherwise, its worth a try if you want a physical sunscreen. * This formual is amazing. I love the finish it has and I have no textural problems realplying this every 2 hours. Best sunscreen I've ever tried. * I am in shock at the bad reviews 😂 I am a 30 y.o. brownskin black women and this product works perfect for my combination, acne prone skin. Not sure what smell the negative reviews are referring to - if anything it smells very neutral, barely has a smell. I have used other SPFs that I had to wash off and throw away because of the overwhelming smell but that is not the case with this product. As far blending and applying under makeup, it is 100% effective. I think some people are not using it properly or are not prepping the skin properly or the SPF is not compatible with the skincare products others are using. I have used this SPF on top of PCA skin and Face Reality. I have routine appts with my esthetician who introduced me to this SPF and I have never looked back. A little goes a long and if you have a white cast, you more than likely used too much. I sometimes apply too much but I am able to blend it out which removes the white cast. 10/10 for me! * I used their matte mineral sunscreen for almost 2 years, but as I've started to reach my 30s, my skin is getting more dry. So having my sunscreen be ""matte"" was no longer a priority. My skin is sensitive so I had to stick to mineral sunscreen, so I decided to try this one. Every mineral sunscreen I've tried has a slight white cast, and you're not going to get away from that with this product either. However it is blendable as it claims to be. 
This one works better with my makeup than the matte sunscreen did. My makeup doesn't seperate over the top of it. 
Id say to give it a try & see if it works for you! * Looked awful under makeup. Foundation would not blend causing a patchy mess.  Had to return. * This sunscreen has great ingredients for oily and acne, prone skin like mine. However, it absolutely leaves a white cast, and started pilling almost immediately. I prepped my skin properly, including moisturizer prior, and it started pilling right away. Definitely returning."

I felt like I rubbed toothpaste all over myself. * My dermatologist recommended this mineral sunscreen. I was previously on la roche posay spf face moisturizer but since it wasnt mineral, my doc wanted me to switch. Instant horrible white cast which was quite comical. It smells like rubber tires. I broke out in a rash by day 2, my skin feels like reptile skin. Took a break on day 3 but on day 4 it burned after i applied it. It pills and was blotchy on my skin.

It burns for a while too. As soon as you use a towel/rag to soothe your eyes a minute later they'll start burning again. This can happen for hours. Wanted to love this because it doesn't leave a white cast if you rub it in enough, but the eye burning isn't worth that. * i bought this in store at the beginning of summer after an employee recommended it to me. i'm a natural redhead, so im pretty pasty and prone to skin cancer/burning easy. i was hesitant because it was super pricy - but a little goes a long way!!! i work outside in the sun all day and have every day for the summer, and i havent burnt ONCE since buying and actively using this. i still have over half the bottle after 2/3 months. it is so worth the money. * I really wanted to like this BUT I've used it a few times and for some reason, after about an hour, even though I'm not sweating, this sunscreen starts to get in my eyes and even my mouth! Awful! Never had a sunscreen move around my face this much. * Be careful with this sunscreen if you are prone to any kind of skin irritation. It has Benzophenone in it, which can cause contact  dermatitis. I get an allergic reaction on my eyelids every time I've used this product. * OMG this is the best sunscreen I've found for my skin, it's refreshing and soft and doesn't leave your skin white or thought of it. I loved it * Goes on white but leaves no white cast on brown skin after rubbing it in. I love how the spray disperses the product evenly. I dont recommend using it on your face directly though. Steep price for an average sunscreen. * This sunscreen is great. I have very oily acne prone skin and this rubs in well and does not make me greasy at all unlike other sunscreens."

Dealbreaker- has micro glitter in it that shines through foundation. Especially in the sun it looks like i fell into a bag of fairy dust.

Kopari, why did u mess up orherwise decent formula? I was going to get it for my husband but he wont touch it because of the micro glitter in it. Please remove the silly sparkles from formula and u will double the purchasing demographic! * I got so excited at first— thin, non-drying formula that finally didnt suffocate my skin. Applied foundation and the rest of makup and looked closely in the mirror. Kopari, why on earth did u decide to put micro glitter in it??? Even with foundation on top, i could see tiny glitter specks all over my face. Not a good look when you sit in a work meeting and the sun hits your face… 
I was also going to get it for my son since its lightly tinted and he has rosacea but he wouldnt even touch it since it has glitter. Please Kopari, remove this gimmicky glitter because otherwise i loved the formula. * I got this product as a recommendation. I hate stand alone sunscreens and they dont work well on my skin. Then i try this one and fell in love. I used it every day. I buy my second bottle and when i use it, it feels gritty like im using a gentle exfoliating scrub. I thought it was user error and maybe i hadnt shaken the bottle good enough. I gave it a second try and had the same results. I never felt the grit in the first bottle. I thought it was a fluke thing so i went to ulta and bought another bottle and had the same problem. I will be returning. Im not sure what happened but i loved the first bottle and im so sad the next two have not been the same. * It goes on easily and feels light on the skin. The problem with this product is that it has sparkles mixed into it, which will make you look super shiny. The smell is also a little off-putting. * I have dark skin (Fitzpatrick V-VI) and this is my favorite mineral sunscreen! It's not invisble, but applies and blends in a way that makes it look like I've just used a brightening, highlighting primer all over my fave. I can tell where I've applied it because of it's slight contrast on my skin, but that helps me to be sure I haven't missed any spots. After I put it on, I just use bronzer around my jaw and hairline to make it look more natural and completely mask the contrast between my scalp and the brightening effect of the sunscreen. It's more glittery than necessart, but it looks great on me! No ashiness, or gray and purple tones. Will repurchase forever. * Wore it for the first time while at the beach, reapplied and still got burned. Its thin and slides right off. No not recommend * It smells like paint and, yeah its mineral sunscreen, but other mineral sunscreens I use do not have what feels like sand in it. Its too harsh for my skin and smells so bad. I will be returning it."

Its like chemical peach, so i would rather just a normal sunscreen scent. Other than that, it's actually pretty good. It blends in well and provides good coverage (I havent been burnt while using it). * First off I love the scent of this cream! It smells like a creamsicle! I have been using it for the past 7 days and I like the fact that it's organic, uses all natural ingredients, and doesn't leave white streak marks and it stays all day. I am very pleased think I found my new one for the summer! I like how it absorbs into the skin and doesn't build up like some of the others I've used in the past. I also love the fact that it's cruelty free and vegan and has a lot of healthy ingredients such as Prickly Pear Extract, Raspberry Seed Oil, and Buriti Oil. And safe for the environment and Hawaii Reef Compliant so unique and I'm so happy to try such a lovely product. Definitely I recommend and will look at other products from the COOLA family!! * First off I absolutely love this. I love that it's not oily or sticky like most other sunscreens. This product is by far one of my favorite sun screens. One thing about this sunscreen is you can barely even tell you are wearing it and it honestly feels hydrating, this is perfect for anyone that is outside a lot or looking for the perfect sunscreen to protect your skin from sun burn and damage! The scent isn't overpowering and as a mom this is my go to sunscreen and I've noticed that it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated! This product is a must have if you're looking for sunscreen that doesn't smell over powering and leaves your skin feeling hydrated but also protects your skin from sunburns and damage ! I highly recommend this sunscreen!

**This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I am absolutely SPF-obsessed. When it comes to sunscreen, particularly for the body, I have a stringent set of criteria. Thankfully, Coola's Peach Blossom Body Sunscreen ticks off all the right boxes. This product seamlessly blends into the skin, eliminating that dreaded sticky, greasy feeling that often accompanies other sunscreens. Instead, it leaves behind a beautifully hydrated finish, which is exactly the radiant look I always aim for. The scent is subtle yet sweet, adding a touch of luxury to the application experience. And let's not overlook the SPF 70 protection level – talk about serious sun defense! If you're on the hunt for a top-tier sunscreen that delivers on both performance and sensory delight, I highly recommend giving this one a try.

This review was collected as part of a promotion * As a mom and someone who tries to avoid getting sunburned this body sunscreen is the best I've ever tried! For starters it is 70% organic. The ingredients, sustainability and overall what the product stands by is absolutely incredible. Living in NC with the fluctuations of temp and weather, I had the privilege to try it out and it gave me the best sunscreen coverage and on top of that the application process was extremely easy! This sunscreen has a smell of peaches which smells amazing and on top of that reminds you of the beach as well. Another thing I loved about this product was the fact that it wasn't sticky or hard to apply. It rubbed in so smoothly. I applied it everyday 15 mins before going out. If you have a toddler who has sensitivity like my little one does this product is great. Every two hours I reapplied it on her and myself and it worked absolutely great! * Skincare is very important to me. On my days off from work I spend a lot of time outside. Whether it's taking my kids to the park or spending time gardening, I make sure to apply sunscreen. It's difficult finding the right sunscreens. COOLA Peach Blossom Classic Body Sunscreen SPF 70 is a great choice for those who are looking for lightweight sunscreen. I like that it's not too thick or sticky and It blends easily, absorbs pretty quick and I love that it doesn't leave a white cast. It's a plus that it has organic ingredients. I prefer unscented products because most scents can be overwhelming but I actually like the peach blossom scent it's not overpowering at all.   The scent wears off pretty quick, which is perfect for me. The other thing I like is that when you squeeze the bottle the hole is quite small and can control the amount of product that gets squeezed out. I also noticed that it leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I'm honestly happy with this product and highly recommended. This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I tried out the COOLA Peach Blossom Classic Body Sunscreen SPF 70, and let me tell you, it's pretty awesome. This stuff isn't your average sunscreen I've been around a lot of cosmetics while working at a makeup store and this product is like a little slice of paradise in a bottle.First off, sun protection. With SPF 70, you're getting serious defense against those pesky UV rays. Whether you're just chilling on the beach or just running errands, COOLA Peach Blossom has got your back literally. let's talk about the smell. Oh man, it's heavenly. The sweet scent of fresh peaches mixed with a hint of floral. It smells like summer in a bottle, seriously. The best part it's reef friendly and free of all those nasty chemicals. So you can feel good about using it, knowing you're not harming the environment.Application is great, it goes on smooth and absorbs quickly without leaving you feeling greasy. Plus, the packaging is cute and travel friendly, so you can take it with you wherever you go.Bottom line, this sunscreen is game changer. It's effective, it smells amazing, and it's good for your skin

I love a milky SPF for layering other products but even with a heavy moisturizer underneath it dried my skin and caused peeling and flaking * I go through sunscreen like its nothing because I tend to burn easily. This one is lightweight and comfortable. I wear it under makeup without any problems like some cause. The only downside is the price for the size youre getting, but otherwise I love this product and will be buying it again. * I love the texture and feel of this sunscreen and it doesn't cause acne for my very sensitive skin. Downside is it goes quickly and the price point is too high. * I have sensitive, dry skin. I'm newer to using sunscreen daily. I researched many brands and this had great reviews, so I bought it hoping for the best. Using it over my serums has helped them work their magic. My dark spots have eased up and my expression lines are less prominent. My skin is more hydrated and plump. I plan to keep using this because ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" and it works perfectly for me! Also, sometimes when I introduce a new product, my skin has a bad reaction (redness, irritation, breakout) and this sunscreen has not caused any negative reactions. * It is not as good as people are saying in the reviews. Yes, it blends out well but it just stays on top of your skin and leaves you with a greasy feeling. Also, for the price… definitely not worth it. I couldnt even finish the whole bottle because it was breaking me out so bad. Some people are saying its good for people with acne prone skin but as someone with acne prone skin, yeah it is not it. I gave it to a relative because i didnt want to be wasteful and even they didnt like it and theyre honestly not that picky with their skincare. Korean sunscreens are the way to go especially if youre acne prone and the prices are a lot more cheaper! * This has been my daily sunscreen since the start of this year and don't plan on changing anytime soon! * This is the acne friendly spf out there. I workout outside everyday in FL, so finding an SPF that was water and sweat resistant was important. I have tried so many, but thankfully I found this one. I've had so many bad breakouts from SPFs that claimed to be acne safe but this one actually is."

I LOVE cocokind & wanted to love it. My fine lines had white cast stuck in them. I looked like a greasy Casper * ingredients are not acne safe - usually love this brand for its noncomedogenic ingredients but this one does not pass the test sadly ): * This facial sunscreen is the best, I have dry acne-prone skin and this doesnt break me out. It does leave a white cast on my medium skin tone, so becareful with the amount that you use. But its isnt as noticeable unless youre lathering on your face. A little goes a long way! * very basic sunscreen, a little greasy, leaves a white cast, feels nice on skin though, it sits on top for a very long time (i think that's good for this kind of sunscreen), a little goes a long way for this product * It leaves a white cast and i have medium tan skintone. After a while the cast will blend out but it still looks like my face is a shade lighter. It feels thick on the skin and feels a bit tacky all day. Be sure to avoid getting it on your hairline. My first attempt at buying this bottle, it was only filled half way so i contacted support to exchange it. The second bottle was more filled. Over all my experience with this particular product is a no go. There are better sunscreens out there for the same price. * If you are someone looking for an everyday-wear sunscreen, this one is for you. I find it very moisturizing and looks good under light makeup. I highly recommend using a beauty blender or brush to blend in the sunscreen after applying it with hands. Although it doesn't leave a white cast, it is harder to blend with just your fingers. Overall a very good sunscreen, would recommend to tweens, teens, and adults! * Finally a non toxic sunscreen. Been usuing got a couple weeks and I have zero complaints! A little bit goes a long way."

I only used cetaphil spf before because of my sensitive skin and it doesnt leave me dry, but this is a wonderful product. It leaves me hydrated but not greasy or oily. It has a nice smell and leaves my skin feeling really great. I dont wear make up daily, so for me i have not noticed any peeling as others reviewed. I use alot of water based skin care products not sure if that makes a difference. I will def keep buying! * This is a really wonderful mineral SPF. I use this over the new Vitamin C moisturizer and the combo is great under makeup. Almost out of my first tube, will purchase a second one for sure! * I was hoping this would fall in like with the rest of their products which are very hydrating & glowy. This unfortunately dried my skin out & left it feeling chalky & matte. It also peels. I have used many mineral sunscreens & know that it can cause issues like this but there are others I have tried that don't. * I wanted to live this product but it pilled on my face :/ it also smells like oranges which is fine, but you're sensitive to fragrances, watch out * Only purchased once and probably wont again. Tried to love it * At first I loved this sunscreen. It has a great finish that is both matte and glowy. But as the day went on I noticed it was drying. Its also scented which I didnt like and is always a red flag for sensitive skin people like myself (and most people who use mineral SPF…) also the tint could look a little streaky depending on your complexion.

Even the one my dermatologist prescribed! I went out on a limb to try this 2 in 1 sunscreen and it did not disappoint. Great mattifying and no white cast (I'm a brown skin gal) yet moisturizing. I took this on vacation and it withstood the very hot heat and sun. Two thumbs up for me. * My previous tube was great. Mattified the skin. Absorbed quickly. It did not make my skin oily. This newest tube is not good. While it still absorbs quickly it does not mattify my skin. I am very oily in a couple of hours if not before. I must note that i do shake the tube before use so i dont think im missing anything. * I used this as a cheaper alternative toy usual SPF  but it was greasy and broke me out. If i dont shake it i can see the oil. * I bought this sunscreen on accident because I thought it was a free gift and didn't check until I picked it up in store. However, I decided to use it because I needed a new sunscreen and surprisingly, this worked very well for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it sits on top of my other skin care products very well. This is also the first sunscreen that hasn't irritated my skin or burned my eyes which I truly appreciate because every sunscreen I've worn in the past had an extremely painful reaction on my eyes. I plan on repurchasing. * I use this product for daily use. It is lightweight and keeps your face clear and oil free. * i'm so glad i found this sunscreen! beginning with the biggest pros for me- i've seen no new breakouts, doesn't pill, and feels like nothing on my skin. i really hate when i can feel an spf on my face but with this product my skin feels light and clean. pilling and clinging to dry patches is very annoying and i've noticed ZERO pilling/exaggerating of dry patches. 

the few cons i have are very nitpicky- fairly strong smell and isn't mattifying. the smell is almost floral but mostly is just a normal sunscreen smell, which isnt a huge deal to me but might be too much for those sensitive to fragrance. i also wouldn't consider this a mattifying products which i actually prefer. theres little to no added shine but again, not very mattifying.

overall i'm so glad i finally found an spf that works on my skin! * Considering I have very oily skin, this didnt moisturize my skin at all. I had to use it as a straight up sunscreen over my regular moisturizer which defeated the purpose for me. It was defined mattifying to the point of drying."

This product is not only affordable,  but it is better for you than  a lot of other products on the market right now, AND you can use it on both face and body. 

You need to pour it out slowly and a little goes a long way.  Start with  a small amount and dab around first- allow it to absorb into your skin before going outside. 

It goes on like a watery lotion,  and dries clear,  and makes my skin look great. * I put this on thinking it would be better than the original since it has spf 50. I bought this and immediately put it on in the car after and it turned my skin white. I struggled to get this off before I went back into ulta. It still didnt come off. Fortunately, they let me return it. * Leaves a purpley-blue cast!
I noticed the cast upon application but I assumed the product needed time to settle and the cast would disappear...... nope!!
Hours later, I was out running errands. I was sooooo embarassed when I walked past a mirror. * This product made me break out really badly!!! If you have normal oily skin dont use this! * I usually use the 30 SPF version and it works great. I decided to try the hybrid and it's a mess. It's very runny and peels of as I tried to rub it in. * While this item was more expensive than most sunscreens, it was worth it. * Other reviews are being entirely to hard on this product. LOVE this sunscreen!  Yes it is thinner than the SPF 30 but it took 1 second to adjust how I apply it, it leaves a whitecast…if you DON'T rub it in which I do because that's whats supposed to be done with cream/lotions (right?🤔), I dont mind the smell I found it to be quite subtle, but someone else might (to each his own), overall for the price point this is an excellent mineral sunscreen."

I also use Bliss Blockstar which I love but the color is too dark for my fair skin and leaves it with a weird ""pink-orange"" cast & the SPF isn't as high. I found this because my skin is sun sensitive/heat reactive and mineral sunscreen is far superior for me. Greasy blobs came out the first time I used it and afterward it made my skin feel greasy. I also don't like the Vitamin C but only because my skin is acid sensitive. So get rid of the excess grease and Vitamin C and it's a keeper! * I bought a tinted sunscreen and have loved it from the very first day of use. I am thrilled to have found a tinted sunscreen that is gentle on my rosacea, doesn't sting the eyes, and absorbs well without leaving my face greasy. The finish it leaves on the skin is beautiful, providing a lovely, satin-like glow. It works exceptionally well even in the summer heat. I've tried several sunscreens before, but this one stands out for its comfort and effectiveness. Definitely the best one I've tried so far! * my go to tinted face sunscreen. very light coverage but blends with many skin tones. always has protected my skin and has never broken me out * I have sensitive skin with rosacea and this is doesn't bother my skin.  The tint is just a hint if color for me (I'm light to med complextion).  I look glowy and dewy.  Its great when don't want to wear foundation.  Mineral sunscreen is so hard to find without the white cast.  This has none of it.  It's definatelu worth a try.  This is my go to sunscreen from now on. * Needed a sunscreen like this. They are either changing the packaging or changing the other formula of another of their sunscreens so I tried this one, it's literally perfect.  I love the skin tint I feel so confident with it and nothing else on, the redness correcting is perfect * Sodium Benzoate is used as a preservative to prevent food from molding. In this form it is safe, however, scientists have shown that negative side-effects occur when it is mixed with Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C). Their studies indicate that it then turns into Benzene, a known carcinogen * Im someone who suffers from acne scars :/ although this product doesnt exactly cover up my acne scars, it really makes the appearance look lighter (if I wanted to cover up my acne scars I'd be wearing a full coverage foundation) I think it's just a plus that it does make my acne scars look less severe!! 

This product doesnt burn my eyes and it really blends seamlessly into my skin. After awhile i do get oily BUT i am an oily skinned girl. Im also light - med skin tone so i cant say that yes or no that this blends in the best with other skin tones. It blends with mine! 

Honestly my go to sunscreen when i want a little bit of something but dont feel like layering moisturizer, sunscreen, and skin tint. It also doesnt pill up! (For me at least! I found as long as im not layering a lot of products underneath it doesnt pill. I found when layering actives such as benzoyl peroxide+clindamycin creme under it does pill up and get patchy.)"

The serum will not melt into your skin. Then if you put makeup on over it, the makeup will not apply evenly and the makeup sits on top of your pores and fine lines and accentuates them! This serum also was not as greaseless as I had hoped. It was a little greasy. So I don't recommend this serum at all. The sunblock in it is 17% Zinc Oxide. That is most likely the reason it never melts into your skin. The price is also very expensive. * It blends into the skin without any white cast but I feel it doesn't get absorbed easily, feels greasy and uncomfirtable on my skin. I can't get past the fact that it feels tacky on the skin for such a long time. For the price point, I'm sure there are much better product out there . * sensitive enough on eczema prone skin during the summer time! * Had high hopes but, after using the full bottle, I did not see any ""Correct""ing benefit. BThey should take this word out of the name, it is misleading.  Also it smells a bit unpleasant which mostly dissipates.
It did give me sun protection but I can get that from a much less expensive product.
Overall a disappointment. * I am a very tan latina who has gone through tons of sunscreen trying to find one with no white cast that actually gives protection. While the price point is steep, it is 100% worth it. You can't go wrong with any of Murad's sunscreens. Love this more than the hydrating purple one because that one smells awful! * Product causes white casting. * This is the first sunscreen I have used that is in the texture of a serum. I like that because it has the consistency of a serum it is not very thick and applies easily. I didn't think this felt greasy but I have used many mineral sunscreens and am used to the way they wear. If you are not you may not like the way it feels on the skin. I felt this product absorbed well and didn't just sit on top of my skin."

I would also add that it has a very oily finish, so if you have oily or combo skin, this likely isn't for you. * I've used this through a couple of bottles. My skin takes time to adjust to products (hence why the couple of bottles). 

I love that it is cruelty free and has vegan collagen. I love that it has SPF 30, a must for me, BUT it smells like sunscreen. It is definitely moisturizing, I don't have an issue with dry skin, BUT it's rather greasy. My daughter has even commented that my face is really greasy when I wear it (not really the vibe I'm going for). The chemicals burn my eyes as the day goes on. If I even wipe my eyes, it takes me minutes to wipe away whatever traces of this moisturizer is around my eyes. If I regularly wore makeup, this would be extra problematic. If you wear contacts, I do not recommend this. Imagine that burning getting caught up under your contacts.

I really, really wanted to love this because I didn't want to go through having my skin adjust to a new product, but I can't justify it based on it being a habit. * As mentioned by others, this would be more accurately described as ""SPF 30 sunscreen with collagen."" Smells exactly like a normal drugstore sunscreen. It's light and doesn't feel too greasy (but there is still a bit of that feeling). Overall it's ok * Just finished my bottle and ordered another one.  I have sensitive, adult cystic acne, 44 yr old skin that is in the normal to dry stage. This product:
1) has a sunscreen like feel to it when you first apply it, then it fades away
2) has a great glass bottle that you can get ALL of the product out of!
3) Spreads well- at little goes a long way- to much will make it sticky and it won't dry down fast
4) plays well with Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid serum and PUR love your selfie foundation. * I'm getting older, and my skin is changing, and I hate it. My old favorite daily moisturizer/SPF by No. 7 started making me breakout after years of no problems, so I had to search for something new. All the others I tried that claimed to not clog pores also happened to be too drying for my slightly oily but aging but still acne prone and also kinda dehydrated skin (ugh). But the moisture level of this Goldilocks cream is just right. If you have dry or slightly dry skin you will probably like it, if you are 40+ you will probably like it, if you're young and have oily skin you might NOT like it because it is not a light liquid, it's definitely a thick-ish cream. I can tell the fragrance they were trying for was *floral* but it leans more chemical, although it disappears in a minute or two. After application the skin feels moist, but not greasy. Makeup applies perfectly over it with no pilling at all. I somehow manage to not look shiny over the course of the day, which is practically miraculous. It doesn't seem to make me break out, as I've been using it for several weeks with no notable flares. I am relieved to have found my new favorite! * i like how this spf does not leave a white cast like other spfs. Plumped my skin right up and gave it a nice silky glow. * Love the fact its a moisturizer and has spf. Its easy to use and dont need as much since it spreads easily on your skin. I can feel it last for a good amount of time too"

GREAT glow to the skin
Protects face from sun
Cons… 
strong grapefruit? Scent 
Feels very oily on the skin

Literally so white and even with 5 minutes of rubbing it into your skin, your skin is grey with stripes of whote because it does not absorb. I have medium tan skin and it makes me look ill. Save your money! * Used this on a trip to Hawaii (this is a reef safe sunscreen) - my kids used it when they went snorkeling. It does leave a white cast on skin, but that is to be expected considering the active ingredients and the high SPF. They came back from the snorkeling trip with a nice tan (we have naturally olive skin, so we tan even with sunscreen) and no burns. I use this regularly on my face to boost the SPF from my daytime moisturizer. It does not feel greasy and it doesn't appear shiny at all. There is an almost imperceptible (not visible in photographs) white cast, but I can live with that. I also use it on the backs of my hands and arms to prevent a ""car tan"" and it has worked well for that so far. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and I would buy it again. * Do not buy! I'm actually headed to Ulta right now to return this. It'll leave a white cast on any skin tone! And it doesn't blend into the skin no matter how much you rub it in. It's also really dry feeling. Skip this product all together.! * I gave this product one star because it does protect from the sun. But I hated everything else about it. It does not absorb it just sits on top of the skin and it's so white. It's very thick and took a long time to apply. It gets all over everything. Not just your clothes, but anything else you touch or bump into. And it is just as difficult to remove from your skin at the end of the day. I threw this product away after using it a few times. * This is the worst sunscreen I have ever tried. It has a weird, gritty texture and is so hard to rub into the skin. It's also super thick and leaves a very noticable white cast. * A truly reef-safe sunscreen for very, sensitive skin that did not leave a white cast on my dark complexion. It can get white when wet but goes away quickly as you dry. I loved it and it kept my skin soft."

The screw-on cap does not work with how quickly the liquid product flows out of the tube. The formula would make so much more sense with a pump dispenser or some other type that would prevent mess when using it. I have to believe that the packaging hasn't been improved in order to keep the price low, but it just defeats the cost benefit when I waste product becauss too much flows out. I'd pay a bit more for this product if I could use it without wasting it. I won't be purchasing again unless the packaging is updated based on customer feedback. Sunbum, please fix this! * I've tried quite a few different sunblocks for my face, and they all feel way too thick and make my face feel oily. This is my absolute favorite that I've ever used! It leaves such a nice glow and honestly makes my skin look great. I want to try wearing it as a daily sunblock, but am a little worried that daily use will cause my skin break out, but I guess that I won't know until I try! I do wish they made this in a bigger bottle so that it could be used for the entire body. * I don't know why i keep trying to like sun bum products. They're all mid or below. This sunscreen is basically a liquid. I was expecting more of a lotion type of formula. It is very runny, so when you go to dispense product, be careful and don't squeeze- otherwise you'll make a mess. * IT ACTUALLY WORKS ON ALL SKIN TONES AND COLORS.
I LOVE this sunscreen it is moisturizing while providing sun protection and a BEATIFUL GLOW. It works well under makeup also. I do recommend applying an actual moisturizer on with it because it works as dew drops. It provides great protection.
I rate it 10/10. * I want to give this 5 star, however when I use it, I find I tend to break out a little. Other than that, I absolutely love it. Gives a beautiful glow and protects really well. This has usually been my go-to for sunscreen when we go to the water park, beach, pool or just days I don't want to wear makeup. I will be looking around for other products to try to avoid getting clogged pores that causes the breakouts but I still love this lotion. * I enjoyed the glow this sunscreen gave me, it went on smoothly, and felt ligtht on my skin. 
It did cause a lot of eye irritation after a few hours of wear, so I dont wear it past my eyes. The product is very watery, and it does spill everytime I apply it.

I can throw everything but the kitchen sink at my skin when it comes to exfoliating and my skin takes it beautifully. I used this product daily for about a month and started to see some irritation. Thought it was maybe the change in seasons or my other actives. I cut back on those products and the irritation got worse. Started to look like a rash / dermatitis thats caused by heavy moisturizers. Didnt even think thats it was the sunscreen until it was literally the only ""new"" product on my face. Went back to look at the product more closely. Contains coconut oil, which as an acne prone girly, I know this is very comedogenic / clogs pores / causes dermatitis. Sad because I liked everything else about the product- price, packaging, consistency, absorption, efficacy. Just doesn't work for my skin. 😞 * I started using this sunscreen and I genuinely do like the way it feels on my face and has a pleasent scent! It does protect well considering I was outside for hours and my face did not burned however, if it got into my eyes (just from me rubbing or from sweating) and it would continuously keep burning my eyes.

What the brand calls 'illuminating' looks oily to me. I wish this had been in stores to try before buying as I could have saved having to return it. * First of all, I did NOT receive this product for free. I paid for it with my hard earned money, so my review is legitimate. I like this suscreen! I was previously using Murad's mineral SPF religiously, but that came with a more expensive price tag so I figured I'd give this one a try. I like this one better. While it does not have titanium dioxide like the Murad, it does have a higher concentration of zinc. I like the texture, consistency and glowy effect of this product. The fragrance is a bit much and can be overwhelming when first applied. I would (and will) repurchase. * This product applies well, has excellent ingredients for my preferences. The pull off cap needs a grip of some sort. The consistency and tint are great for me. It is wet though. It goes on wet feeling and stays wet. Not like an oil. * I live in Florida and am obsessed with sunscreen year round.  I am a believer yhat its the most important part of any skincare routine. I try anything new that cones put and have my favorites for different scenarios.  But, this, by kate sommerville is my new overall favorite.  Its a fluid like cream with a slight tint but I wouldn't consider it tinted.  It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any residue.  It made my skin glow, hence the illuminating.

First reason being, it's 100% mineral! I personally gravitate towards sunscreen sticks because they are convenient, great for throwing in my purse & using as needed while being mess free. Although mineral, this formula is not drying AT AL & does not leave a white cast! It does have a heavier feel when directly applied but absorbs well once worked into the skin. I have dry skin so I do not mind the more hydrating formula. It is also great for sensitive skin! Does not break me out, burn my perioral dermatitis & does not burn the eyes. This formula is long lasting & withstands the heat! Cannot say enough good things about this one! * Since this is a zinc oxide-based sunscreen it will leave a white cast, but not as bad as our other favorite Neutrogena Baby cream.  I have a very fair child who goes to outdoor summer camp and this is great as it is water-resistant and doesn't run/sting the eyes. * It leaves a slight white cast on my face and it leaves a sticky feeling after applying. * It's to sticky! * It leaves a white cast all over.
Does not go away if you blend either * A little smaller than I expected, but still a great product nonetheless. It has a nice, light scent to it that I assume is from the papaya. I keep this in my purse as my hand sunscreen for when I'm driving and the sun is creeping in through my windows. * This is part of my sunscreen arsenal when I know I'll be in the sun all day sweating. The coverage feels 100%, but it can be a little masking with a white cast. You will still need to blend it a bit with your fingers. It also works great with dry skin and smells wonderful."

Also the coconut fragrance lingers on your face for a long time. Really disappoint overall and cant wait for my eyes to stop burning. * It's a light mist that does feels slightly sunscreeny- but not too much that it turns me away from it. I have oily skin and I hate using face spf for that reason so I wanted to try this instead. I like the light feel and it didn't irritate my skin. * I like that it doesn't have alcohol or a smell like the setting spray version but it is pretty oily when applied. Also wish the SPF was higher. I went though the bottle quick since I kept reapplying before I noticed how oily it made me. It would be great for dry skin girlies. * I think there are better spray sunscreens on the market for a better price. I'm really debating on returning this. I've used it three times, and each time I'm happy with the glow, but it very quickly turns to grease and my makeup slides off. I think for the price, you're better off getting something else. Also, the packaging is pretty but it's not practical. I bought this to put in my pool bag and my hiking pack, but it's glass packaging… I get making sustainable packaging but this isn't practical for what I'm using it for. * Maybe I got a bad bottle but the spritzer clogged up to spray a narrow, hard stream. It was bad news when I sprayed it and it hit me in the eye! * I spray this everyday after my normal skin care and makeup routine. It has a light coconut scent that smells wonderful.

I continue to use it because, although the smell is terrible, the formula remains effective and keeps me from burning in intense sun and it's modestly priced for an oil free sunscreen that's high in SPF protection. That's what keeps me coming back. 
Keep in mind, this is a sunscreen lotion and not advertised to be a daily moisturizer. I use another SPF product by the same brand for daily use. I only apply this product prior to outdoor activities. * This is my tride and true. It looks fabuslous on its own and underneath makeup. There is a slight white cast that is eliminated with enough blending. I also notice it helps lessen the amount of sweat thats produced on my face. I workout everyday in an unconditioned gym in the south, need i say more?

This is it * I hate this sunscreen. I thought it would have a flawless finish like all the korean chemical sunscreens I like. It leaves a white cast on my face as if it were a mineral sunscreen and does not completely rub in no matter how much I work it in. And then it does not dry fully either, it just sits on top of skin. Surprisingly, it doesnt make foundation pill, so that gets a star. I will not repurchase. * I didnt get a sunburn but it is very hard to rub in so you need to apply alot of product. * I used the old version for years and it was nearly perfect; hydrating, easily spread, and non irritating. The new version takes a lot of work to spread in, leaves a white cast on my skin(nc45), clings to hairs, and isn't hydrating enough. * I've tried a few sport sunscreens and this is one of my favorites. I wear it everyday before my workouts to protect my skin outdoors and indoors from harmful UVA/UVB rays. I sweat a lot and it doesn't burn or sting my eyes which is a plus. One of the cons I have to note for others is, it is a little bit thick and greasy like a lot of sunscreens, but that doesn't really bother me personally. * Leaves you with a white cast after trying to rub it in."

I usually stick with Asian sunscreens as they have exceptionally elegant lightweight formulas with filters far more advanced than those you can find in the US. I got a sample of this, however, and was genuinely surprised by the formula and how it felt on the skin. For reference, I have oily-combination skin, so a light SPF is a must. This sunscreen definitely fit its description of a gel serum- I would say that's definitely how it felt going on (maybe a tad bit more of a gel cream, but still quite light, regardless), and in my experience, it sinks in quite quickly while still leaving the skin feeling the skin hydrated and moisturized. I don't typically use moisturizer when I use this, but that's just what works for my skin personally. I have very sensitive eyes and this also did not sting my eyes at all when applied around my eye area, which is a huge plus for me as that can turn me off from a sunscreen completely. Different things work differently for everyone so I would still recommend getting a sample and trying before spending this much on a sunscreen, especially as there are lots of incredible SPFs that are MUCH more affordable, but finding a sunscreen thats actually enjoyable to use can be extremely hard so I definitely appreciate finding one (a US sunscreen, at that) that feels this nice and would absolutely recommend.

***This was purchased with my own money. This is NOT a sponsored review in any way and all opinions are my own. * I'm always on the hunt for a sunscreen for my face that doesn't feel sticky and hot.  This one isn't quite the naked feel I'd like, but I think it's the best I've found so far.  Unfortunately the cap won't come off so I have to screw off the top to access the product.  I'm assuming there's a pump under the cap which would really be convenient, but I'm going to have to pour the product into my hand.

BUY ANOTHER SUNSCREEN!!! * Super greasy and leaves a really bad white cast! * I don't why so many people hate this.  It is my holy grail mineral sunscreen.  It works and doesn't flare my rosecea or excema.

1) It is fragrance free.  It doesn't smell at all. I am picky - -and I noticed no smell. 

2) Mineral high spf — no irritating chemicals

3) oil free and noncomodogenic

4) it works

5) gluten free - I am celiac and get a rash and excema from topical or oral gluten

5) it doesn't make my skin burn or itch like all of the chemical sunscreens

6) yes, it leaves a whitish cast on my light olive skin.  So, after applying, after a few minutes, I brush on a light bit of MAC Studio Fix in my usual NC20.  Yes, I am a bit shiny, but I have oily skin and am shiny 24/7 regardless

So, this is my holy grail sunscreen.  Yay!  I have to wear it because I have developed hyperpigmentation and have to use trentinion at night and The Ordinary Niacinamide everyday. * Not brown skin friendly. It least major white cast like I look so ashy :( * I purchased this while on vacation, when I realized I had forgotten to pack my sunscreen.

Unfortunately, I will be returning this. I have a medium complexion and combination skin. It did not leave a white cast. * Estoy feliz de averiguar encontrado ente producto soy alérgica al sol y necesitaba encontrar un protector físico estaba desesperada por mi alergia micara y cuello y brazos llenos de ronchas no sabía la diferencia entre físico y químico cada año iba a emergencias por los granos odio tomar medicamentos ahora estoy con mi bolsa vacía pero sin granos gracias dermalogica * This suncreen is….def something makes me feel rlly greasy take forever to blend if you want a fast absorbing sunscreen this one is NOT for you it literally takes a whole day for it to feel somewhat not greasy on your face, dont get me wrong i have sensitive skin and i like how it didnt break me out BUTTTT  THE WHITECAST IS INSANE, im the whitest dominican there is to exist and it got me over looking purple😵‍💫 theres so many better options for cheaper😭 atp im just using it to cope with the fact that i spent that much money on it, your better off buying the la roche posay sunscreen * Gifted by Dermalogica. This product was nice. It was a little sample size but it did the trick. Felt nice going on my skin and very smooth. Might have to get the larger size of this next time for summer * My favorite brand!

I am never without their SPF for it offers great coverage without making my skin oily and definitely without causing breakouts. 

Perfect to apply after my moisturizer & before applying  my make up.

I highly recommend it!

Will be returning asap * The Coral Reef shade didn't come in my set, Firecracker did. I was looking forward to trying the coral shade the most. Just wish the set was actually the colors advertised! I think the formula is decent, but a little overpriced. * I really like thses.  They smell so good, like mint.
Wish they were available in store. * First off I'd like to say that this is the first time I've tried a tinted SPF lip balm! And I really like what I've tried so far! I've tried these for about 10 days and I really like how they feel on my lips. They are very moisturizing, silk texture and made in such pretty colors! My favorite is the Firecracker color. I like how nicely it glides on and doesn't feel cakey nor weighed down. I love the fact that these has SPF and I don't have to worry when I'm swimming at the pool if I get dried out lips. Also love the fact that this is organic, Vegan, and made with natural ingredient's and safe for the earth. Such high quality products and I'd love to test out other lip balm colors and also try other COOLA products! Perfect for the beach! * First off, I've only been using these for about 5 days and I'm absolutely OBSESSED. I love that it comes in 3 different shades and flavors but mainly the variety!

One of the first things I noticed about the lip sunscreen is how well it works, some products it takes a few days of using it for the effects to really work but this worked immediately, usually my lips crack and dry out depending how long I'm outside but this actually hydrated and protected them from cracking or drying out. One of the other things I loved was the fact you can barely even tell your wearing it! It doesn't feel weird or oily or cakey! And the other thing I loved was the fact it came with 3 different flavors! I highly recommend this product for anyone wanting the perfect go to lip sunscreen!!

This review was collected as part of a promotion. * This lippie trio is a must-have in your vacation bag! To say I'm obsessed is an understatement. I have fair skin and I try to avoid sun exposure as much as possible. (I promise I'm not a vampire.) That being said, I love it when my makeup doubles as my extra sun protection! I was so excited to try these tinted lip balms out, and I am so glad I did! The color payoff for these lip balms is pretty amazing. You can build up the coverage or sheer them out. They all have a different scent to each color, and each one smells great. I did also experiment with using the lip balms as a blush and I was extremely pleased with the results. My favorite shade out of the pack has to be 'Summer Crush' due to its vibrant color. If you're a lip balm girlie, you are going to need these if you are out in the sun. This review was collected as part of a promotion * The coolas travel mineral lip trio was just perfection! Every color was beautiful and the packaging was spot on! These lippies provide spf 30, is definitely 40 mins water resistant and glides on like a charm! I went away for the weekend and the hotel I was staying at had a pool where I decided to put them through the  water resistant test. Let me tell you it did not rub off at all! Every lippie has a different name and beautiful crafted smell that definitely goes with the name. The packaging said to apply 15 mins before sun exposure which I did and It held through the whole day with a second reapplication because the sun was really harsh that day. I also forgot to bring blush and I used the firecrackers lippie on my cheeks and it gave me a natural beachy cheeky glow. Blended in my cheeks so seemingly. I love what the brands stands for and how the ingredients are great!"

The scent is horrible and smells old even though it isn't expired. It will ruin your day is you put it on before heading out to the beach/pool because the smell is so awful * The texture is really nice, but the smell is off. Has a stale smell * Coola's sunscreen lotion went on easy and without a greasy, oily film. It lasted well throughout the day, and smelled great! * Put this on before going to the beach and then reapplied, still ended up a lobster. Not a fan unfortunately :( * This product gets the job done. Feels smooth on skin without feeling greasy. I also appreciate the business model of Coola. Scent is not fresh and tropical like piña colada infers. I'll use this again but maybe buy a different scent next time * Like the facial sunscreen  this went on so smoothly, and dried down quickly with no sticky or greasy residue. I haven't experienced any pilling. Smells great, but not too strong. Great sunscreen! * Product was expired and smelled horrible. Will not buy again."

As a white red head, sunscreen is essential for my everday skincare. I wish it was 50 spf instead, because once i apply my makeup i get worried the spf is too loq and then i get a small burn on my cheeks from the sun. * Exactly what I was looking for!  I have UBER SENSITIVE SKIN that can be prone to breakouts with the majority of products.  This is everything it says and more!  Weightless, blends beautifully and my skin doesn't freak whatsoever!  Great product line! * I love this weightless sunscreen.  It's light and does not have the traditional sunscreen smell.  Blends very well with make up. * omg i have been looking for a mineral sunscreen that doesnt leave me looking like a ghost (with a whitecast) forEVER!!! This is my favorite thing in the world. I use this by itself on no makeup days but it works extremely well with all of my different foundations on top!! Pls never discontinue this💕💕 * I love the way this product feels and how it looks on my skin. It doesnt pill or dry out my already dry skin. However, I won't buy again because it burns if i put it anywhere near my eyes. Also washing my face with it on is a nightmare because its impossible to keep it completely away from my eyes. So, if your eyes/skin are sensitive i would stay away."

Provides daily defense with SPF 50 and the highest PA rating to reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles and prevent future sun damage. I love this sunscreen, it's my go to, the thing I can't live without, and my everyday sunscreen! We all know how important it is to use sunscreen and this is the only one I've found that just melts into your skin! No flakes! No clumps! I would absolutely. recommend this product to everyone because sunscreen is so important for healthy and protected skin. * This sunscreen Is FINALLY what I've been looking for. I am super senstive, dry, acne prone skin and the fact I can put tbis one and not have ANY skin flushing, tingling, or irritation makes me so happy! I put this on everywhere and it does not make my eyes sting or water, YAY! 

I love how lightwieght it is and just seems to blend into the skin immediately. It really feels more like a regular moisturizer that has sunscreen than a suncreen with moisture. 

As an esthetician, this will definitely be what i recommend to my clients! * I have very dry, acne prone, sensitive skin. I've been on the hunt for a sunscreen that doesn't exacerbate any one of these issues. I don't use mineral sunscreens because they don't agree with my dry skin. This sunscreen is almost perfect. It doesn't burn my skin, it doesn't cause any skin flushing, it's hydrating, it doesn't pill, it doesn't break me out. Unfortunately it caused my eyes to sting horribly throughout the day. I really loved this sunscreen at first, and I was so disappointed. I'll continue to use it as a body sunscreen though."

I live in hot humid Tampa Florida and I wanted to switch to a mineral based spf. This is an excellent product that I've repurchased 10 times now and will continue to repurchase. Great! * I do not know what magic they put in this, but they cracked the code. I am a medium skinned black woman and there is no white caste, even after working out for an hour! Also, it is so comfortable, it does not feel like you are wearing anything AND it is very moisturizing.  I could not stop touching my face. 
This version is better than the non sweatproof version and the best mineral sunscreen I have ever tried, and I have tried a lot. * This is perfect for your outdoor activities--high SPF , water/sweat resistant with very minimal white cast for a zinc-only sunscreen at that high SPF (give it a little time for the slight white to dissipate-note however that i am fairly pale). I also use this on my neck and chest for everyday wear because it doesnt get ""orange"" tint on my collars and 
clothing like my everyday tinted spf does. It feels moisturizing in the skin. It is very different from kinships spf 30 product although I Highly recommend you try both!! * first one suits my sensitive skin, no more irritation and watery eyes due to sunscreen * I love the other Kinship SPF so I thought I'd give this one a try since it's ""water resistant"" and SPF60. I don't see HOW this is water resistant because it never sets and its continuously greasy, on top of that my skin STILL managed to dry out two hours after I've applied it. It rubs off into everything and if you touch your face at any point in the day (I've worn it for 6+ hours) it moves and gets into everything. I've almost finished the whole tube thinking maybe it's user error... it could still possibly be the case. I'm 30 with rosacea, combination dry skin with hormonal breaks out and a thyroid condition that tends to dry my skin and hair out.. I wanted to like this sunscreen but it's a big no. I can't make it work, I've tried it alone, with moisturizer, under makeup, with serum only. I don't feel protected when I wear this sunscreen. It's also got this iridescence to it that at first I thought I would like but it just makes you look like *shiny* vampire. * After using the kinship self reflect spf 30 for several months, this sunscreen is definately my preference over the self reflect. This sunscreen has a very natural satin finish and is very hyrdating without being greasy, while the self reflect spf 30 has a dewy finish and is more lightweight. It takes about 5 minute after application for it to absorb and the cast to disappear. The long term benefits for my very sensitive combo skin have been amazing. The keratosis bumps on my cheeks have completely disappeared and this is the only product I have change in my routine. It has a very subtle vanilla scent that disapears shortly after application. Also the cast is hardly noticable on pale-medium skin. My friend with dark skin borrowed some and said that even though there was a slight white cast for her, it was surprisingly subtle given how high spf it is. This sunscreen has replaced my foundation at this point because  texture of my skin has improved so much since using it. I wish kinship made a body sunscreen like this. Kinship is a solid clean skincare brand and most of my products are from kinship since they are only of the few brands that cause irritation for me. If you have sensitive combo skin I would especially recommend this brand. * After using the kinship self reflect spf 30 for several months, this sunscreen is definately my preference over the self reflect.

My requirements for sunscreen are 15% zinc at least, no hormone altering or toxic chemicals including aluminum, and it cant be heavy and greasy. So finding a mineral spf that looks good is really tough. My skin rejects a lot of products too. But im so happy with this because it passes all of my requirements and it looks natural and has light coverage. Also a sunscreen has to have a minimum of 15% minerals in order to get a true 30 spf and this passes that test too. It truly is a good product. The light color matches me perfectly. I have a neutral undertone, green eyes, pretty fair skin and brown hair. Its also pretty affordable. Because this is so hood I irdered other products by them. People need to appreciate items that dont mess with your hormones. Thise things are in everything these days. In regards to the other review, It's possible to have allergic reactions to literally anything, so just because someone had a bad reaction doesn't mean its the products fault. There's nothing in it that can burn anyone. It's impossible. It's just an allergy. I use only Dior snd Chanel makeup and this is just as good for the days i want sunscreen and a no makeup look. It has some coverage and its not buildable. Its a sun tint. * I like the key ingredients and the coverage is pretty good, but blending it in is not fun. It dries down pretty quick, looks patchy and all my texture is emphasized. It literally looks like a layer of product sitting on my face. 

The first few minutes there is a slight burning sensation but it goes away. My biggest CON is that it makes my skin feel tight and dry, even though I already have dry/combo skin.

After wearing, even though I wash it off before bed, I wake up with welts on my face, a problem I haven't really had before. * I want to preface this by saying I used this religiously for over a year.

I hadn't used anything else new but I did let my face heal up for quite some time and tried it again recently, purchasing a completely new bottle thinking I had a bad one. My face is doing the same thing again. So I'm certain this was the problem. I'm not really sure why since I've never had issues before, they had to have reformulated or maybe some bad batches recently, I'm not sure but my skin didn't agree at all!

I previously purchased the Mad Hippie face serum with spf and liked it, but saw this and there was more product for a similar price so I figured I'd give it a go. It is very light and blends easily for a mineral sunscreen, leaving a minimal cast (if at all). It has a very light, negligible scent. I don't wear daily makeup so I can't speak to layering it with other products, but I really like this sunscreen so far. * I didnt fond myself reaching for it a lot. Ive been trying to experiment with mineral sunscreens and while I think this did the job fine, it was very had to warm up in my hanfs out for me, and seemed greasy. 

I feel like this would be the ideal sunscreen for winter with ifs moisturizing properties, but not for summer, at least for me. * Even the smallest amount has left a white cast and flakes. I got a huge zit almost immediately after applying. Will be returning! * I love Mad Hippie but this is not my favorite product so far. It runs in clear but leaves your fingers feeling sticky afterwards. * this sunscreen is mattifying so it doesn't have that greasy finish on the skin like other sunscreens, easy to blend into the skin, the white cast is not very noticeable as compared to other mineral sunscreens although i am pale and would not recommend this sunscreen for darker skin tones * I don't understand the white cast comments. maybe you do have to make sure it's all rubbed in and not just slather it on, but once it's on it felt great on my skin! I have oily/combo skin & it was perfect for me."

Its not too matte and also not too dewy looking when it settles. It looks great under makeup. It is not causing acne, i of course still have hormonal acne though * The only spf ive been able to find that doesnt break me out and the finish is beautiful. I hate the price point tbh, but its worth it considering that it's the only one that works for me. * Ive tried to order this new updated pump packaging twice now from Ulta and have received the dropper bottle. * Oily, acne prone skin and wow! It leaves my skin stunning and no breakouts. Just dont get it in your eyes because that stings. * The ingredients listed on the ulta site/app are VERY incorrect. I have a skin allergy and was pretty disappointed when this arrived and the box listed 4x as many ingredients as the website. * I have dry skin & I initially enjoyed this sunscreen. At first it was hydrating without excess oils & silicones but hours later my skin would feel dry again, maybe due to the Hyaluronic Acid in this. The twist bottle also opens on its own and spilled all over my drawer. * I have stuffled looking for an amazing sunscreen that goes well with extremely sensitive skin and dry skin and is SPF50. I experience no stinging, tingly, burning, or redness on my face. The price is definitely worth purchasing and rebuying. Happy to say I have found my go to product."

It will run into your eyes if you sweat. It has a strong fragrance like men's cologne. I don't know if it is a signature Vichy scent or what, but it is not a fragrance that plays well with others. * My skin is somewhat sensitive. Not many products, including sunscreen, break me out, but the ones that do, REALLY mess me up. This sunscreen broke me out terribly. Not all over the face, but a few cystic blemishes, including one of my nose. I'm still dealing with the scarring from that :( The scent on this is VERY strong. I am not sensitive to scents at all. I don't care when products are scented, but there is no need for it be this strongly scented. What were they thinking? 

I bought this during the beauty days sale so I will keep it and use it on my neck and chest for the anti-aging benefits, but if you are breakout prone from sunscreens, be very careful with this one. * My first time trying out this face sunscreen and it feels nothing like all the others I've tried and used under makeup! This is veil like, smooth application…. BUT!!! The scent! The scent is STRONG and it does not go away even after you applying foundation or bb cream… I really wanted to love this product because of the peptides but im disappointed I will not be using it as I wanted due to the smell. Side note the description does indicate there is a floral scent to it (i missed reading that part) I agree it is a floral scent except it is strong! * I like how this goes on and the potential benefits, however, it irritates my rosacea and makes me redder. * When I first used it, I loved the cosmetic elegance and how it feels on my skin. Yes, like what everyone was saying, the fragrance is so strong. I typically do not have any reaction to any active ingredients. I use VC, VA, anything with no problem. I had my first allergic reaction three weeks ago. I was red, a bit swollen, very itchy from face to neck. I thought other new products I just opened and used caused it, and at that time i was using other sunscreen for sensitive skin. Two weeks ago I started using this again on a day I ate a lot of seafood, so I thought it was the seafood gave me the same reaction. Now I was totally healed and used this sunscreen for the third times, and again my entire face look like monster. I wonder what exact ingredient gave me allergy. * Would have been okay, the scent is strong, but this stung my eyes after about an hour."

This was a winner. The only down side is the smell but worth the 5 seconds. * It does produce a glow but needs higher SPF especially during peak Florida summer * I usually don't leave reviews. But this smell is terrible...it literally smells like trash * This product has such great reviews and I had high hopes as a mineral sunscreen superuser. But it didnt live up to the hype- the smell is gross as other people mentioned and it left my skin greasy. Minimal white cast at least but still not my fave. * I personally am not a fan of how this product looks on my skin and how it feels. I've been using it daily for the past month or so since I got it to really give this product a shot but it's not it. I dont understand the ""glow"" everyone else is talking about but on my skin freshly after washing and everything it is extremely greasy and stays like that all day. I will give it credit for not leaving much of a white cast, easily blending into the skin, and looking nice under makeup but the thick greasy feeling I can't get over. My skin is on the dryer side if that means anything to anyone. Also if I go out on a really nice sunny day right after applying my face still burns!?!?!?! so not very sheilding. For me it is not worth the money or time. * I am on probably my fourth or fifth bottle of this. I have very dry skin so some might find it a little too dewy looking but I love it. No white cast. Looks great under makeup. And I've never gotten sunburned. I can't imagine wanting to try anything else. * This was recommended to me by of the Utla Associates and she said, once I started using it I wouldn't go back to the one I was originally looking for and she was right."

I shake it until the cows come home
I use just ONE moisturizer underneath it
I put it on NAKED skin

It PILLS, without fail * this is my new foundation. 2 in 1 for sure. I am going for a second bottle. * I've used heavy full coverage foundations for almost 20 years. I wanted to add sunscreen and skincare to my makeup. tried several tinted serums, sunscreens, moisturizers, but this one actually has some coverage and gives you a glow. I stopped wearing foundation completely now. this is my daily go to. if I need extra coverage I use a little concealer. I still do my smoky eye and it looks great * Product is definitely oily and even after shaking VERY well, it was still separating and had almost sandlike grains in it. Additionally it was not blendable at all and made my lightly tanned skin look ghostly. Am returning asap. * Love this product!  Fantastic protection and a light moisturizing coverage.  This product does it all."

I love FAB products but this is NOT it. * Very heavy sunscreen. Does not blend well and leaves white cast. Will not be purchasing again. * At this price point I expected better. It's very difficult to rub in if you're using the correct amount. I'm using it up on my arms, but it's still annoying to apply. * I have rosacea and my skin is extremely sensitive. This sunscreen calms my skin down and keeps it protected. The combination of the zinc and oat are perfect. I love this so much!

I know I'll be rebuying it once I run out. * Again - poorly packaged; leaked all over the very small bottle.  Over priced for the amount. * Don't like this product. If u sweat it will burn and irritate your eyes. * I have several Kiehl's products, I am in love with this brand and have the best skin I've had in a long time. Some things I deal w/ are being acne-prone, oily, rosacea and very sensitive. I've been doing some research on rosacea and have read that wearing a daily SPF can help with redness (among many other benefits, of course). I wanted to make sure I was getting a product from a brand I believe in because face sunscreen has been tricky for me. It's usually greasy and breaks me out significantly. I spent the extra money for this product and am unfortunately not very pleased. Like other comments, this product does ball up on the face. I find that I have to let my daily moisturizer sink in for AT LEAST 10 minutes before I can put on my sunscreen. And the more you try to massage it into the face, the more it will ball up. Other than that, my MAJOR complaint about this product is that after applying and about an hour after it's on my face, my skin starts to burn. It feels as though I have a mild sunburn across my entire face where you can feel the discomfort and burn. Again, I have sensitive skin and apparently it's just not reacting well with me. I've gone a few days without it and then tried it again and it is 100% this sunscreen. I'm out side of my return time so I'm stuck with it and really disappointed. I hate having to purchase products to figure out what works for my skin. Just writing this in-depth review for those of you with the same kind of skin as me...just to think twice. I will say, it does eventually sink into my skin and does not leave it greasy so that's a positive. * Since it is new to me, I am still trying to learn the right amount to apply. Too much (first try) and I had to blot it to make it just right. Second day, it was fine. It does not leave a white cast, definitely a pro. For its high quality, the price is reasonable!"

So unless you like that kind of look I wouldn't suggest it for my brown and black girl, boys, gays or theys. * Such a nice sheer tint, blends easily. definitely get this!!!! * My skin is sensitive and acne-prone so it's oftentimes challenging for me to find an spf that works. I absolutely love this spf tint - it looks natural on my skin, doesn't break me out, and it provides good sun protection. Please bring back all three shades of this! I miss being able to purchase it from here * Im a chemical sunscreen girl, but I kept seeing this sunscreen on social media so I decided go give it a try. 

PROS: 
- whipped texture 
- neutral tones 
- matte finish 
- absorbs oil
- good around the eye area 
- great for oily skin and/or summer
- 50+ SPF
- great for an active lifestyle

CONS: 
- feels a little heavy until it sets 

I do two layers of sunscreen: first a chemical sunscreen and then a mineral sunscreen. This is the best mineral sunscreen I've tried (Neutrogena, Cerave, MDSolarSciences, DMTLGY). * It's REALLY good, just not for someone with dry skin. I do like the texture, coverage, natural looking color, and the overall matte apperance but after 30 minutes it dries me out so bad. It would be good for humid days/someone with ""normal"" skin. * Over all good but very prone to rub off on clothing. Can't use near v neck and don't pull a top over your head. * The title says it all.  I purchased this, very excited to have found a sunscreen that is spf 50 and tinted AND acne safe.  Read some reviews saying it was not good at all, etc, great for oily skin.  This is why I was happily surpised that on my fair, dry skin it felt and looked great.  It was a little bit dark for my skin but it just made me look bronzed there wasn't any harshness or orange.  And it felt good on my skin under makeup (concealer and powder) all day.  Very suprised it also did not transfer.  Overall great product but I am suspicious of how it is spf 50 when the active ingredients do not indicate this at all."

The 12 dollar Neutrogena sunscreen will give you the same results. Save your money. * Another physical sunscreen that pictures black women but then isn't inclusive. It still gives whitecast on brown skin. Disappointed. * For me personally I found it to be watery and made my face look pasty white. Just like the kind you would get from normal skinscreen. Granted it does smell good and does the job of protecting my skin. * This spf is so lightweight and easy to wear under makeup. I have very oily skin and for a change a spf lotion didn't make it worse. I can't recommend this enough * The actual sunscreen is great but unusable because of the pump. Have to take off lid and try to fish out little globs of it to actually use. Too bad. How could their quality dept approve this packaging?! * I really like the product itself. Unfortunately it's a little too thick for the pump to dispense it. I have to take the lid off and use the pump stick to swipe it on my hands. Also, ran out after just a couple of weeks of use.

That being said, it does a great job protecting from burning and tanning, and despite it's greasiness it's held up for many hours in sweltering heat and humidity. I wore a thick layer to the theme park, set it on the face with SPF powder, and throughout the day dabbed the sweat off with face tissue. No burns or tanning. Not an everyday wear SPF but good for when you expect to be out in the heat/sun for a time. * White cast on face :/ This is not for melanin skin at all. Im olive/medium tan, kund of like jessica albas skin tone, im not even that dark and this left a obvious white cast, my face had that purple hue, I looked awful. and the consistency is very thick, goopy and sticky and had this weird smell. I guess this would be fine to use for the body if you are not easily bothered by consistency or smell
. I prefer a sunscreen that feels like its not there * So i was in the market to looking into some new susncreens. I was very interested in this brand because its suited for sensitive skin. I decided on this SPF 50 cream. But the moment i felt it in my hands it was little thick to blend. I could tell by just feeling it on my face and seeing it move around that it was going to leave a noticeable residue. The scent was strong and gross. I wanna say it smelled like feet. So i returned it immediately. * Think this is a great sunscreen. Doesn't leave a white layer on your skin. Rubs in easy while protecting your skin. * I'm very disappointed, this is definitely Not Avene. The smell is ghastly and the texture is very dense much more the original Avene . * Smells awful but wears nicely with no white cast on fairer skin, however for deeper skin it would likely be unsuitable. You get a great amount for the price compared to equivalents from Supergoop, LRP, RoC, and others. * I can't believe this is an Avène product.  All their products are usually light, fresh, airy, & pleasant.  THIS ONE SMELLS TERRIBLE.  I CAN't stand it.  Smells old, musty, almost stale like & chemically.  Runny consistency.  I'm so DISAPPOINTED. I looked up reviews and I see I'm not the only one. (Thought maybe I got a bad bottle). Not sure what happened with this one."

If you're super pale and in the market for a tinted moisturizer or sunscreen, I cannot recommend this enough! * I'm actually a fan of other Bliss products, but I have never experienced a whiter cast from sunscreen in my life. I could tell it would have one as it came out of the bottle, but wanted to trust the ""sheer"" claims. Will be returning. * I really like the light weight feel of this sunscreen, espeically for a mineral one. Although I find it pills under makeup and can cling to dry spots. So best for a no makeup day. * Iv tried a lot of sunscreens and I mean alot . Every single sunscreen I have used breaks me out even mineral ones. This sunscreen is by far the best one iv ever used its just amazing . * This sunscreen is so good. I've tried so many sunscreens and this one has everything I want. It actually absorbs, no white cast, it doesn't get into my eyes, and it's recyclable. * I need to stick to mineral sunscreens for my skin, so it's been hard for me to find one that leaves a minimal white cast, has high SPF, and is water-resistant. I just finished my first bottle of this, and so far I think it's one of the better ones I've tried! It doesn't irritate my skin, blends impressively for SPF 50, and doesn't feel heavy at all.

I have tan skin, so I usually wear a BB cream over this to cancel out the slight white cast this leaves. Note that it's a high SPF, untinted *mineral* sunscteen, so I cannot expect it to be fully clear. 

The one downside is that this seems to turn white in areas that get wet or have a lot of friction, such as under the bridge of your glasses. It can be rubbed back in very easily, but that's something to note."

It comes in an easy to use squeeze tube and is a great size to take on the go. The texture is creamy and lightweight,  and glides so smoothly on my face. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave my combo skin feeling greasy or tacky. It has a light scent that smells so good, not like your typical sunscreen scent, but to me like cucumber melon scent. I absolutely love the way I smells!! It has a pretty shimmer that leaves my face glowing and beautiful.  It doesn't leave any white cast at all and feels amazing on my skin. It's honestly my new favorite spf, and I will definitely be buying more to stock up. I received this product complimentary from Mad Hippie. * This sunscreen is a game-changer! It gives my skin a beautiful glow while providing strong SPF 29+ protection and 80-minute water resistance. I love that it uses non-nano zinc oxide and is free from harmful chemicals. The added antioxidants make my skin feel healthy and protected. Plus, the eco-friendly packaging is a huge bonus! I was gifted by madhippie * I recently tried the this sunscreen, and it's fantastic! The lightweight, non-greasy formula absorbs quickly, leaving no white residue. It provides excellent broad-spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays, making it perfect for daily use. Plus, it's water-resistant, which is great for outdoor activities. My skin feels moisturized and protected all day. Offered by madhippie * This luminizing spf has a slight shimmer that is very pretty under the sun or flashlight. When applying this sunscreen I find that you must start blending and rubbing it into the skin right away for a considerable amount of time to decrease the likelihood of white cast. Unfortunately, when too much product is applied it does leave a white cast on my skin tone and it clings to the dry patches on my face. Working in thin layers is optimal but it can be time consuming. This sunscreen has a cucumber scent which does not bother me personally and it mostly goes away after being absorbed. I like that this sunscreen is not extremely greasy feeling, it does not burn my eyes and that it was thought out and produced in an ethical manner, being reef safe, packaging made from recycled materials and with ingredients that support the skin, however, due to its 29 SPF rating I will wear it in the winter when the UV rays are significantly lower.

I honestly use it every day as a body lotion because it gives the most beautiful shine without being greasy. It makes my skin look so healthy. It, of course, also serves its purpose as a sunscreen. Please please PLEASE never discontinue this!!! * I love this stuff. It smells great and it works very well. But as an outdoor concert girlie, I'm begging for a miniature version so I can carry it in a small bag * I love this sunscreen! It's an efficient multitasking body  sunscreen that checks all my boxes. The tropical scent is immediately inviting, with the sweet notes of pineapple and honey melon giving off a refreshing, summery vibe that makes applying sunscreen feel less like a chore and more like a treat. The formula is impressively lightweight for an SPF 50, absorbing quickly into the skin without leaving any greasy residue or white cast. It feels more like a hydrating body lotion than a traditional sunscreen, which is a huge plus. The moisturizing aspect is particularly beneficial, keeping my skin soft and smooth even after hours in the sun. It's not water resistant so it's not ideal for sport activity or if you will be sweating a lot. This is also not a face sunscreen, I would describe it as the perfect daily body lotion sunscreen, which I found out also has anti-aging ingredients like Hemp seed oil and vitamin C. As a Floridian I can use this everyday before heading out and take with you to re apply during the day. This review was collected as part of a promotion * As a beauty expert with over two decades of experience, I'm delighted to share my insights on the Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon Herbal Body Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF 50 by HEMPZ.

First Impressions and Packaging:

Upon unboxing, the packaging exudes a tropical vibe. The flip-top tube design is practical, allowing easy dispensing without mess. The vibrant label featuring pineapples and honey melon reinforces the product's fruity promise.

Thoughts on HEMPZ in Comparison to Other Sunscreens:

HEMPZ, known for its hemp seed oil-based products, has a loyal following. Their commitment to cruelty-free, paraben-free, and vegan formulations aligns with modern beauty standards. The Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon Sunscreen stands out due to its unique scent and natural ingredients.

In comparison to other sunscreens, this one combines sun protection (SPF 50) with intense hydration. The 100% pure hemp seed oil ensures nourishment, while the tropical fragrance adds a delightful touch.

Incorporating into My Daily Routine:

I applied the sunscreen after my morning shower. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula absorbed quickly, leaving my skin soft and subtly scented. The SPF 50 protection gave me confidence during outdoor activities.

Expectations and Results:

I anticipated a moisturizing sunscreen that wouldn't compromise sun protection. Thankfully, the Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon Sunscreen exceeded my expectations. It kept my skin hydrated throughout the day without feeling heavy or sticky.

My Likes:

Fragrance: The pineapple and honey melon scent is uplifting.

Hydration: Hemp seed oil and shea butter work wonders.

Non-irritating: Perfect for sensitive skin.

Impressive Key Ingredients:

Hemp Seed Oil: Rich in omega fatty acids, it nourishes and soothes.

Shea Butter: Emollient and hydrating.

Pineapple Fruit Extract: Adds a refreshing twist.

Melon Fruit Extract: Boosts skin vitality.

Best Suited Audience:

This sunscreen suits anyone seeking hydration, sun protection, and a tropical fragrance. It's ideal for daily use, especially during warmer months.

Recommendations:

Absolutely! I recommend the Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon Herbal Body Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF 50. It's a delightful addition to your skincare routine.

Final Thoughts:

HEMPZ's Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon Sunscreen combines efficacy, fragrance, and natural goodness. As a beauty expert, I'm impressed by its balance of protection and hydration. * I am a medical aesthetician and makeup artist with over 28 years of experience, so I am constantly educating my clients on the importance of skincare. 

Understandably,  SPF can be a pain, having to reapply often to maximize its effectiveness.  So, having a boost in its protection factor to 50, makes it even more worthwhile, in my opinion. 

HEMPZ has created a spectacular SPF that doesn't feel as heavy and cakey as most, too.  I love using it by the pool, because Texas sun is brutal, and being landlocked, the wonderful tropical scent transports me to a little oasis for a while.  

I definitely recommend this SPF for anyone serious about anti-aging and cancer prevention.

This review was collected as part of a promotion. * As a longtime Hempz fan (their lotions are the BEST!), I was thrilled when they launched this SPF 50. Let me tell you, it did NOT disappoint! Living in Texas, sunscreen is basically glued to my hand, but finding a non-greasy one can be a struggle. First off, the scent is AMAZING. Imagine a tropical vacation bottled up - sweet pineapple and honey melon perfection! It's lightweight and leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, and even a tad glowy. Plus, it goes on clear, so no white cast to worry about. Most importantly, this SPF 50 provides top-notch protection. Whether I'm poolside or just conquering my daily errands, I know my skin is shielded from those harsh UV rays. This sunscreen is seriously a summer essential, and I can't recommend it enough! * This summer I'm protecting and powering up my SPF! I have been obsessed with Hempz since spotting it in stores. I'm also a huge pineapple lover. Since first using this HEMPZ Sweet pineapple & honey melon body moisturizing SPF 50 I have been constantly receiving compliments on my scent. The texture itself is thick yet very smooth. The color of the sunscreen is white yet blends in a breeze, beautifully into my skin and adds a radiant finish to my body. The body cream SPF does dry down after a few minutes, then I'm ready to go out and have fun under the sun! This moisturizing body cream is my favorite product this summer because plump plus protected skin is a must. Everyone needs this sunscreen for their tropical adventures, I also do recommend re applying every two hours. This review was collected as part of a promotion."

So I do like it for that. But the chemical scent is so strong, If even put the product up to my face, my eyes sting and water. It also pills into little balls when your rub it in. I havne't gotten burned when I wear it so it does protect my skin- & I'm finishing the bottle because I don't want to waste it. But I would not buy it again. * Feels and smells like a sanitizer. 
Not comfortable puting this on my littles ones. * This stuff has a very strong alcohol smell and mixed with the banana it's almost too much. That being said, I really like how this applies on wet skin. Will continue to use for reapplication purposes only"

I really was hoping this would be a great, sheer, water resistant, mineral option for the summer.  However, if you use more than a smidge, this pills.  I tried on bare skin, over just a toner, under my full normal morning skin routine and it pills on application.  The texture is nice and not drying, and the cast is minimal, but present,  in comparison to many other mineral sunscreens.  I am aggressively neutral on the smell, its a little sunscreen-y, but it doesnt bother me.. Its neither strong, nor long lasting.  Also, its not a great amount.  I plan to use this up on my hands and ears. * I have mixed feelings about this sunscreen. One the one hand it dries down quickly and isnt sticky which I really appreicate. On the other hand it pills around my chin, neck, and eyebrows…which isnt the worst thing but is a little annoying. I mostly use this sunscreen on days where I need to run out of the house and need something that dries down quickly. * I love this sunscreen! As the name suggests it is very sheer and leaves my skin feeling moisturized without feeling sticky or greasy (a big ask for my oily skin). I will say, it does pill up under makeup if you start immediately after applying, but I give it 10 minutes or so and you should have no problem! * I used to use Biossance squalane mineral sunscreen until people started having reactions and it was pulled off the market. In my search for a comparable sunscreen, I found this one and honestly I think I like it even more! Feels very lightweight and moisturizing and blends in well! I like the glow it gives but I don't think it makes me look oily (I have combo-dry skin).My only wish is if they could make an SPF 50+ version! * I've been trying to convince myself that I really like this sunscreen for the last few weeks and I just don't think this is the product for me. Pills frequently regardless of what products I use underneath it, especially around the edge of my face. Won't end up finishing the bottle. * Only postives it has a nice gel texture and does not leave a not white cast. The smell reminds me of glue. It also pills a lot. * Upon arrival the product seem to be so extremely small for the price that I paid, it also looked like it had little to no product inside. Such a waste of money!! I was incredibly dissapointed and won't recomend to anyone, would give this zero stars if I could. I put 5 instead so everyone else could see this review bc I'm s

For a zinc oxide mineral based SPF, this tinted moisturizer feels very light on the face. Not as light as a chemical SPF moisturizer such as a Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, but it's a mineral SPF so it sits as a physical UV barrier like mineral sunscreen does. 

No white cast with this mineral SPF bc it's lightly tinted. I was surprised as others bc it's not apparent on the packaging except for one small info graphic on the side that it's tinted. But I imagine that's how they got around it having a white cast residue. I have extremely light skin with reddish hair and using two pea-sized product amount left no discernible cast once it soaked in over a few minutes. 

The scent is akin to bubblegum or cotton candy but thankfully does not last once it's dried. I really like that it's a light weight mineral tinted moisturizer, but simply based on the overly sweet scent I probably won't buy this product again. I need a mid30s formulation of this product not the teens formulation this product feels like it's geared towards :P * I had no idea it was tinted. Nothing (at least prominent) on the packaging that indicates it's tinted. When I squeezed it out, it's orange. Looks absolutely terrible. Not a glowy tan. Rather the color of a former POTUS. * I didn't like the consistency or tint * I absolutely love pacifica as a brand and honestly i really like this line too, the cleanser is great. But this sunscreen is a no go for me. Its WAYYYYYY too dark, im naturally very pale but ive tried it both on my usual pale tone and tanned and either way its patchy and dark. It feels extremely heavy and gross on the skin and was a sensory nightmare. It dries super fast so its a pain to blend even if it was a closer shade to me. Spend the extra 20$ and get yourself some supergoop. * I love this product so much! I replaced my foundation and now use this for the summer. It makes my face look so healthy and gives it a nice glow. No sun burns either! * One of the worst tinted sunscreen I've tried. Tossed it after using it twice. It would matt down and stayed on looking greasy, not luminating but greasy looking! * I completely missed that this is tinted. I wish it said so on the front of the packaging. The tint looks horrible on me, which I would've known already. Otherwise, it's greasy and heavy."

Goes on very smoothly, not shiny, not too thick, does not make my face look white. It blends in very nicely and has even helped reduce the redness on my face. Love it obsessed need more. * couldn't even try this product to see if it was any good because the pump wouldn't dispense any product and it was extremely annoying to try to scoop out the sunscreen with my finger. * This is the one sunscreen that doesn't break me out and it doesn't have a weird smell. I love that it has a pump but only 1 out of the 3 bottles I had gotten had a working pump. The tubing of the pump is too long and kinks up in the container, and I have to scoop it out with my fingers. It sounds like the defective pump is a big issue for many of us. Please fix this Earth Harbor! 

Nerding out-Many sunscreens claim SPF 30- each 1% zinc oxide = 1.6 SPF units. With 18.8% zinc oxide, this is truely SPF 30, protecting against 97% of UVB rays.

I will stay a loyal customer as long as they fix the pump issue 😊 * burns and itches my skin. pump doesn't work. * the sunscreen itself is fine but the pump on mine doesn't work so i have to scoop it out with my finger * Unfortunately, like others have said, I couldn't get the pump to even get any of the product out. I tried multiple times, thinking the product just had to work its way up the pump but, when I opened it, the tube for the pump was so bent around and around that there was no way the product could have made its way up. Additionally, the product is SO thick that I'm not sure how it even could have fit through the tiny tubing. Instead of scooping it all out, I'm planning to return. * Left my face feeling kind of greasy, but the biggest issue is how jacked the bottle is. When I opened it, I couldn't get the pump to work, and removed it to see if I could get it working. The tube leading from the pump into the bottle was bent into a zig-zag, rendering the pump completely useless. Now I have to scoop it out and use the bent tube like a tiny spatula. The moisturizer itself isn't anything special. Not sure I would buy again, especially if they're not cautious during the packing process to make sure the pump will actually work."

Gets worse throughout the day. Do not buy. * Need a mineral sunscreen since skin has been sensitized by tret use, i know physical formulas will never be as cosmetically elegant as chemical, this product is the worst i've ever tried. Separates horribly, clumps on my lips and hairline, strong white cast. * I religiously used the original Ultra Calming moisturizer from Aveeno for over 20 years.  That moisturizer was perfect- amazing texture, good pump packaging, and most importantly it was 100% effective at keeping my redness at bay.
This stuff (which is essentially their replacement to that one) is  garbage.  It's tinted (why?), it has a sticky texture which makes it difficult to blend in, and the packaging is cheap.   On top of all that, it actually has made my redness worse.  Oh!  And it has HALF the amount of the product as the Ultra Calming moisturizer- for a higher price.   Corporate greed trickling down to the consumer does not go unnoticed.  Johnson & Johnson majorly dropped the ball with this new ""Calm and Restore"" line. * Aveeno used to make worlds most perfect face moisturizer. When it was discontinued I was distraught. I tried so many products but my skin breaks out to everything. I figured this is the closest thing they had to the moisturizer I loved so much. It's not. IT IS SO STICKY. It feels AWFUL on my face. I always wash my hands after using it. It doesn't spread well because it's so sticky. it feels like it isn't moisturizing at all. It's also tinted?? Why?? Why is it a tan color? It would probably be awful for any dark skin girlies. I'm super pale so it's too tan for me, and when I itch my face, a ton of orange pigment comes off onto my hands. God I'm so disappointed in Aveeno for discontinuing their last calm and restore product. This one is awful…. * This is a tinted product, which I personally am not a fan of. It also doesn't say anywhere on the bottle that it's tinted? And I find that it pills a lot, But I have very sensitive skin and it hasn't irritated me or broken me out so not bad overall"

I buy it over and over again. I'm very pale so I can't speak about white cast, but it's not a mineral sunscreen so that shouldn't be a huge problem. It is very hydrating but not oily. It feels like I've just put on a nice moisturizer. It also reapplies very well. It never pills on top of itself. I don't wear foundation so I don't know about wearing it under anything but it does look good under a skin tint or concealer. * Tried this out for a humid, 100 degree full sun TX vacation. It never stung my eyes! It leaves a shine, but is comfortable to wear and less greasy than any others I've tried. Effective, comfortable, I'm sold! * This is great to use in the morning before my run. I have normal/combination skin and I don't even need to wear a moisturizer under this. It gives me a glow, not over the top. Doesn't sting my eyes, even when I sweat.  I also love the oil-free version for everyday use. That version is perfect over moisturizer and will work best for those with oilier skin. Shiseidos newest sunscreens are a big improvement from their previous version, which I already used. * The only sunscreen that EVER worked for me. Doesn't make my skin break out in fact this sunscreen helped my oily skin get under control. It hydrates without being oily! I don't even need moisturizer with this sunscreen. Thank you ulta for carrying this gem! * not waterproof...this product is a joke.
says "" if sweating or swimming, use a waterproof sunscreen ""

Really? what's the point of a sunscreen?
And the customer service was least helpful. * I rarely give product reviews but two thumbs up for this sunscreen!  I have used several types and brands of sunscreens and other Shiseido sunscreens as well.  This, by far, is the best for me as it applies really smooth on my skin, sits well under my make-up, and never leaves that white residue on my face.  It has enough SPF to protect my skin under the sun as I take a lot of outdoor photography plus it also leaves my face really moisturized throughout the day."

My incision sight was still pretty deep and uneven. After only a week of applying this sunscreen both on my face and directly to my scars they faded even more than they previously had with the prescribed gel!!! It works wonders!! Both for general scars and also acne scars or pigmentation. Swear it always clears them up for me overnight. A little goes a long wayyyy. It's also the perfect size for traveling and on the go application. My skin is super soft after too, there are no cons to it.

It's grainy, leaves a horrible white cast even on my very fair skin and just sits on the skin wrong. It doesn't sink in and dries and flakes and leaves white residue all over my clothes and eyebrows and somehow also is horribly greasy all day, and I have no idea why but no matter what I do it spreads and ends up in my eyes after about an hour after applying and it HURTS."

I've always heard really good things about this brand, and thought I'd give it a try, but unfortunately it's just not for me. I felt like the texture of this product was sticky even after drying and left my face feeling very greasy. I have rosacea and my skin tends to be very reactive to new products. I was hoping this would be different, but it did make my entire face break out pretty badly. The fragrance is much heavier than I would like from a facial sunscreen. The sun protection factor was great, and I will continue to use the rest of the product on my chest/hands/body. If you have dry skin and don't have sensitivity issues like I do, this probably is a great product. * I absolutely love this product!!!

Did not have any issues with pilling and wore beautifully under my matte foundations! * This is a very good sunscreen, but I think they need to take it back to the lab and tweak the formula as it flakes and pills by midday. Because of this, you cannot wear it under foundation otherwise you'll have a big mess on your face. I've been using it for about a year now but I'm currently looking for another brand. I will revisit this product in the future if they ever improve the formula.

Great price! * I purchased this item when it first came out, and I was very excited to support a black owned brand and have another option for a mineral sunscreen that wouldn't look crazy on darker skin. It does blend in very well, although it still has a slight light cast as any mineral sunscreen is going to. However, I noticed that it would pill throughout the day. I tend to unconsciously rub my face throughout the day, and I would get little bits of sunscreen on my hands. I tried using other products underneath thinking my vitamin c or my moisturizer was the issue, but no matter what combination it always pilled. * I have dry skin and really wanted to try this out but I didn't know it gave a matte finish so I follow it up with a water resistant sunscreen from black girl sunscreen. * This product leaves no white cast and has a matte finish which is a plus however it pills very easily and flakes off throughout the day. Due to this, I am unable to apply any sort of blush/ highlight/ etc. after application as it will cause the sunscreen to flake off which is clearly not ideal. For reference I have combination skin. * I've tried this several times since I purchased it and no matter what I try, it pills up and flakes all day whether alone or under makeup, with or without my skincare.  After seeing the rave reviews I had really high hopes for this.  The search continues! * I bought this sunscreen along with the Supergoop unseen sunscreen and I am returning the supergoop sunscreen and keeping this one. I have medium skin and this doesn't leave a white cast. I love that it works well with my skincare and under my makeup. I haven't had no issues with it pilling on me or it making my face look extra greasy. I wish that it had a higher spf but I  will still be repurchasing."

I love adding a super watery cream underneath it,

Be sure to wash your face and moisturize prior to applying the sun screen and makeup. It really helps to keep your skin from feeling dry. 

The consistency is very liquidy. It doesnt feel sticky. Although it does leave a white cast when worn alone so I avoid doing so. Instead, I apply the Shiseido stick sun screen when im bare faced. I havent experienced any eye irritations with this."

It smells like a fruity drink from your favorite pool bar. It has a sheen/glowy finish without glitter! I am a distance runner and it is sweat proof and I have yet to get a sunburn! Overall my favorite sunscreen i have ever used. My only complaint it is does get a tad greasy- I wouldnt say it is terrible, but i dont mind greasy when im running! * This is so lush and smells heavenly. I loved using this before going outside in my walks knowing my skin smelled amazing and was protected 

*this review was collected as part of a promotion* * I absolutely LOVE this sunscreen. Its so moisturizing and it doesn't make me feel sticky after putting a lot of layers on. I also wake up and my skin is still soft from the sunscreen. Definitely going to continue to buy this sunscreen. * This is my first time trying a Hempz product and I am completely in love with it. I have tried a few sunscreens in the past, but I always get turned off by their scent. The Sweet Pineapple & Honey Melon sunscreen instantly became a favorite because it smells great and doesn't leave a white cast.

Putting on this sunscreen made me want to travel. I get an instant ""St. Tropez"" feeling. I would describe the scent as walking down the beach because it made me reminisce about a time when I lived in a beach town. It made me also want to take a walk down the beach while holding hands with a lover. 

I honestly did not notice the smell of the hemp oil, which means the brand did a great job masking it with the pineapple and melon.I was not the only one who fell in love with it. My sister who is a lifeguard has been on the hunt for a high-quality sunscreen. She snatched this from me the moment she tried it.

We both agreed that it won the ""Best Smelling Sunscreen"" award. The best part about this sunscreen is that it's very moisturizing. It felt as if I was putting on lotion instead of sunscreen. 

I believe this product is great for the gourmand girlies. I would recommend keeping this in your purse and using it as hand lotion. I'm pretty sure our hands need sunscreen anyway! * This product is like if your favorite body spray, moisturizer and sunscreen had a baby. Super fresh smelling and easy application. It actually smell's so good I couldn't believe it was spf 30. Identical to the look and feel of the old favaorite hempz lotion. I've been working in the beauty industry for more than a decade and I can't remember a time that I didn't have a pump of that lotion laying around. This will be a new staple in my beach bag absolutely! * Hi!  My name is Lisa and I'm a fan of This Hempz SPF 30 sunscreen has become one of my new favorites. The Sweet Pineapple and Honey Melon scent is perfect for summer, it reminds me of a tropical beach vacation. Hempz products are super moisturizing, formulated with 100% Hemp Seed Oil, they leave my skin feeling soft and nourished. This SPF also has Vitamin C for additional skin care benefits, I've noticed it adds a nice glow and evens out my overall complexion. I like that I can use this for protection against the sun and still get some healthy color. If you are looking for a new SPF that provides rich hydration, never leaves a white cast and smells amazing try this! This review was collected as part of a promotion. * I really like the texture of this SPF it is very lightweight and it doesn't leave a white cast.  But I don't like the stickiness when it drying down. I love the smell of this it smells Delicious and sweet. It has vitamin C in it which helps brighten your skin and the hemp seed oil is moisturizing which is a plus. My skin feels and look very hydrating. I put SPF on my face faithfully every day, but I always forget to put SPF on my body and if you do the same I think this would be perfect because it just feels like lotion, not an SPF so I would grab it and throw it in my bag on the go and use it everyday due to the smell."

Effective vitamin C & fab primer. I actually use a lil extra to create cast if wearing makeup. * I've had a good experience with this product. Initially, it does go on whiteish, but to me that indicates the quality of the SPF, which is why I bought it. Once applied, I feel it performs well; I don't feel too dry or too oily. * Leaves a white cast, pools in creases as you sweat, and it made my skin dry and textured. Just…no. * The lotion feels thin but it still does not quite rub in completely. Especially if you sweat, you will have white everywhere. I am very fair skinned and the white still shows up and doesn't go away, would not recommend. * If you have combination to oily skin and don't plan to wear makeup over your sunscreen or do something while wearing it that makes you sweat, then this might, emphasis on might, be okay for you.
The only things that this product does well is the SPF 45 rating, the percentage of vitamin C, and it does NOT burn my eyes at all.
That being said, it is not moisturizing, it is not a good primer for makeup, it does not sit on skin well because it moves around a ton (even on clean bare skin), it doesn't play well with any other products since it pills at the drop of a hat, and it does have a pretty bad white cast (but that is to be expected since it's zinc oxide).
So far, it has not made me break out and I didn't get a sunburn, but I can't use it with any of my other products, which doesn't make me want to wear it at all. Several other people complained about the smell, but the smell didn't bother me. Initially I thought it smelled like lemon or citrus, but in looking at the ingredients, I think I was smelling the Rooibos? Doesn't smell like a typical sunscreen to me. Still would not recommend this unfortunately. * Im acne prone and oily, i read it left a white cast so i tried a facial oil prior to applying it, it left thick white cast and left my skin feeling flaky and dry. Will be returning! * I have bought other products from Derma E and have loved them, so I did not expect to walk around with a ghost like face."

BUT it needs to be 2.5 time the amount for the price. Following the directions I apply generously to face and neck, but didn't re-apply every 2 hours--just once more in the middle of the day on no makeup days. The tube lasted less than 2 weeks using it this way. WAY too spendy * I received this product as a sample initially, and I will say that I hesitated to try it because I usually only use products labeled ""clean"" and ""cruelty-free"" and this is neither of those. Additionally, this moisturizer has a slight fragrance which would usually disqualify it from my regimen but I got hooked on the scent and the effect. I had 2 small wrinkles between my eyebrows and after using this, they're gone. I use this over my serums and facial creams and I'll buy this again and again. * I love the moisturizing, glowy feeling of the product with SPF! Perfect for daily use. * I don't ever leave reviews bit hos product is amazing! I have worked for dermatology offices for years and have been fortunate to try many different sunscreen products but this one may be my favorite ever! It's not sticky, goes on smooth and leaves a beautiful glow and looks so natural! * This product goes on very heavy and greasy so I was already nervous.  I headed out on a hike and six miles in, it started melting and oozing into my eyes.  There was nothing I could do at that point. Worst sunscreen ever. Buy Goop Unseen Sunscreen. * Best SPF ever. I love the glowy finish and it even works under my makeup. * I tried this in store while shopping and immediately fell in love, I've been using it for 2 weeks now. The glow that it gives my skin is beautiful, it also does not leave a white cast nor feels like a traditional SPF. I even tried it under makeup and it made everything look dewier and smoother. I highly recommend!"

I was looking for a high SPF mineral formula without too much of a white cast. This was OK on first application - a little thick though so you need to work it in; then as you reapply, it turns into glue. Takes a lot to get it off of your body in the shower. However, no sunburns with multiple applications. No skin irritation. * It's not terrible, but I do not like it remotely, HALF as much as I like the Ulta brand one. I'm new to mineral sunscreens and I bought 2 from Sun Bum and 1 from Ulta. Both of the Sun Bum mineral sunscreens (SPF 30 and 50) are chunky and ridiculously harder to spread on the body. I felt like I was spreading toothpaste, or bondo on my legs and arms. I couldn't imagine trying to put it on my face. The Ulta brand is a sheer delight to put on in comparison. I felt like I COULDN'T rub it in and get past the white cast, and I am so pale I could blend in with a cloud. After seeing how hard it was on my legs (30SPF) and arms (50SPF), I didn't DARE use it on my face and I used the Ulta instead. 50SPF was the intended sunscreen for the face, but that wasn't happening with how delicate my face is from acne right now. Yeesh. I'll use the Sun Bums, and my husband will, but I definitely wouldn't repurchase it. Makes me reconsider the entire line from this brand after both tubes were so much chunkier in consistency and THICCER than your girls thighs versus Ulta's. * This is thick upon applying it, but after about 10 minutes it settles. I love this for my sensitive, allergy-prone skin. It is also chemical free which is great for sensitive skin! My favorite part is the no white cast. I don't know how they managed to do it without tinting it, but this is POC friendly. Also doesn't pill like most physical sunscreens do. * I purchased to use as a moisturizer sunscreen per recommendation of store associate to protect hyperpigmentation. This product is very thick and sticky. It burns my skin also. Not a good purchase. * I used the spf 50 version of this formula, but sadly it was too heavy for me and caused breakouts. This formula seems much lighter, the white cast is not bad, and the feel is good! Still a bit on the heavier side of sunscreens for me, which is why this is going to be my go-to winter sunscreen. I won't bother to look for another, this one does it the best! * A little background on my skin: I'm a redhead and have very fair/ pale skin (alabaster foundation) which is moderately sensitive and burns easily (and won't ever tan, it just peels and burns again). This sunscreen uses fragrance, but doesn't irritate my skin. It feels lightweight and not greasy. The formula is thin enough to easily apply and rub in quickly (much better than the Cotz mineral sunscreen for face and body, non tinted). It smells like coconut, which I love, and doesn't leave a cast or sticky grease layer on my skin.
If you have a deeper complexion than me and are concerned about a cast, I couldn't say for sure but I think this stuff is worth a try since it's so thin and rubs in so well. If you have very sensitive skin, just tread carefully as the scent is very strong. Definitely worth a try, but keep the receipt just in case it doesn't work for you. Hope this helps! * The only downside is that this uses fragrance. Thankfully, my skin isn't extremely sensitive so this is okay for me, but if you have very sensitive skin or are allergic to coconut I would tread carefully if you try this. If you don't have sensitive skin, it smells so nice and absorbs quickly without leaving a cast. However, I have very pale skin (I usually use Alabaster foundation with cool undertone) and don't know if this will leave a cast if you have a deeper complexion. It's thin enough that it's probably worth a try though, since you can rub it in so well. Hope this is helpful!"

This Product received a poor raring on Yuka App. Product contains many harmful ingredients including dimethicone  which harms the environment and ends up in the blood of fish, birds and mammals building up in the environment without ever breaking down. Cotz advertising is an example of brand green washing at its finest. * This is good for touch ups when you're on the go. Despite being a stick format, it has a mousse like texture. I like that it can fit in a pocketbook (the cylinder shape makes it awkward for a pants pocket). This does feel heavy on my skin (normal/balanced type) and has a sticky/tacky feel after application. This also left a whitecast on my skin (Fitzpatrick type 2, fair Asian Skin, wear clinque foundation in shade bone; I swiped at least 4x per section of my face to have adequatecl coverage). The finish is definitely on the shiny side, especially for me. My preference is for matte or skinlike finish, so this was too shiny for me, but someone who likes a glowy finish may like this. I would recommend this for someone with fair skin on the dry side (or balanced/normal in a dry climate) and doesn't mind a shinier/""glowy"" finish."

Im medium tan skin tone so i end up looking like a clown. Seriously its like white face paint on me and its hard to blend after it dries. Couldnt put foundation on too because it ended up pilling and made me look like i had patches * I use this daily on my face, neck, chest, and hands, alone or as a primer. I do rub it in well and have learned to avoid my eyelids, but around my eyes is fine. If you have oily skin, this one may not stay put. I have combination skin, fair and pink and prone to sunburn. It is one of the only mineral sunscreens that I will put on my face because I'm prone to breakouts. It's this or Cotz. Since Cotz is a tiny tube for the money, I got this to travel with and not need a separate body sunscreen. I've never gone back!

On your body, be sure to rub it in well. If you don't, it will transfer to your clothes. * It leaves a horrible white cast, and melts off when I sweat. It's really thick, and no matter how little I use, or how much I blend, I can't make it work. * It leaves a horrible white cast, and melts off when I sweat.

I don't have any issues with a white cast so I'm not sure if other reviewers who have are using it correctly. I have dark olive skin and it looks fine on me. Just rub it in good.  It doesn't get greasy at all. I'm very pleased and will buy again. * Number 1, you need to use 1/4 tsp on your face and neck to get the spf protection on the label, for any brand. But the awful white cast just made me use less. Using the proper amount would make me look like a ghost. In fact, it actually did in a group photo a friend posted. When I saw it I was like OH NO. And I even had foundation over it. Also nice that you can't even read the new packaging. I'll use this up on my feet or arms I guess. * The scent is super strong and leaves a white cast."

Glad I got it on sale and won't repurchase. * Might work on super dry skin, but not for my normal (sometimes normal/oily combo) skin.   Makeup is sliding off after 30 minutes.  Glad I purchased while on sale because not worth the full price.  Will keep to use on hands and neck since it does not smell and still need sunscreen protection. * I live by Avene products and wanted to love this so badly. Maybe I got a bad batch, but there is a lingering smell to this that I just cant get past. * As someone who has tried dozens of sunscreens, this one is elite in my opinion. The skincare in it makes my skin so glowy and hydrating and I love how dewy my skin looks when wearing. It wears well under make up, but you do have to rub it in well to prevent the white cast and so that the product absorbs in fully. It does feel a little bit sticky and a little heavy, but I don't necessarily mind that. Overall it feels more like skincare than sunscreen in my opinion and I will definitely repurchase."

Seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I bought this when it was on sale. Sadly, it doesn't live up to the hype. It was lightweight on my skin, but it smells like cheap body sunblock. And every time I used it I had a new zit forming by the end of the day, without changing anything else in my skin routine. I wanted this to work so badly, but it does the opposite of being good for acne prone skin. * I was going to give 4 stars because it has a Proactiv scent I'm not in love with, However 5 stars because it does a great job as an spf as well as clearing up your face at the same time. * Since I am using retinol, my dermatologist insists that I wear sunscreen.  I have struggled to find any spf sunscreen that my reactive sensitive oily acne-prone mature skin doesn't breakout to and react to.

This is my first facial sunscreen success.  This one is great!  Doesn't leave me greasy or overly shiny.  Doesn't irritate or break out my skin.  I only wish it was higher spf, but better spf 30 than nothing. * I have very oily skin and hate wearing SPF. I have trial and errored so many mositurizers and this is the best one. Doesn't feel greasy or heavy on my skin. Actually has cut down on me looking greasy throughout the day. Highly recommend! * I have purchased this sunscreen many times.

The hotel was selling this sunscreen. I was a bit hesitant because I break out easily, but had to purchase since we were staying on a beach with intense sun. I wore this for 3 days, reapplied every few hours, and I did not get a single sunburn. Surprisingly, I also did not break out. There is a slight white cast, which I don't mind as it makes my skin look a bit glowy. I definitely would repurchase this sunscreen. * So, i guess mineral sunscreens just arent meant for me. I tried a bit on my hand in the store and was hopeful because it didnt leave a shiny grease spot on me, and i didnt notice the white pallor it left (dang tricky store lighting) but with the first face application, i could see i made a mistake. I am VERY fair to begin with and now i look like Casper with this lotion! Add to it the slight sting it causes and dry flaky skin the next day and this is just ALL bad. Only reason i gave 2 stars is because of the non-greasyness * I wanted to try something new for once. I put it on, it felt fine and looked fine. the next day I woke up and my face was flaky, red, and burning. I couldn't go anywhere for a few days not even to work! * I bought this sunscreen becuase i have heard good things about Supergoop! and becuase this is a mineral based sunscreen. I already knew that the zinc oxide in this gives a white cast, but I was not prepared how hard I had to rub my skin to get this slighlty blended into my skin. Would not purchase again * When I first tried it on my hand, I felt it rubbed in we'll so I was hopeful because it's so hard to find sunscreen for brown skin tones. But after using it fully on my face and arms, it started to pill when I had moisturizer, cream, or eczema ointment underneath. It was kind of like it turned to hard paste when trying to rub into skin because the consistency changed. It was pilling on my arms more because I put moisturizer beforehand. I put it on my face without moisturizer underneath and had a white cast for at least 4 hours until the natural oils on my face came in and flushed it out a bit. It's not for darker complexions. It has a chalky sunscreen smell. It's very pricey for sunscreen and I expected better. * I read a review on here that said this sunscreen leaves a white cast and I 100% attest to that. It's a pretty strong white cast that might work for a day at the beach but not for regular use. Hopefully Supergoop! can make a mineral sunscreen for darker complexions but for now I'll continue using their Play: Everyday Lotion SPF 30. * Wanted to like this because its 100% mineral but the white overcast on my complexion is too much for me to use. The regular Play lotion works better for me."

And it expensive considering the content. * this sunscreen is great. at first i was not a fan but as continued to use it i found that the pros outweighed the cons. what i love about it is that one pump goes a long way and it spreads nicely. i also love that it doesnt leave a white cast. i apply this on my facial hair and it dries clear. its pretty insane. i was gagged when it dried clear on my BEARED! i was sold after that. it also leaves the skin tacky and glowy, which i love. the only con is that its watery but i noticed that it allows the sunscreen to spread and glide across the skin nicley. like i said, a little goes a long way. i think for people with facial hair, its hard to reach the skin underneath, so i do use more than the avergave person. its a decent amount of product for the price but for people who need to use more, it can be just enough for like a month. nonethless, she did what needed to be done. * I usually don't write reviews but I had such a terrible experience with this product that I felt it was only fair to share my results because my skin looked the worst that it has ever looked in my life!!

I had been using Mario Badescu's Hydro Moisturizer w/ Vit C and my skin was looking great with no breakouts.  Unfortunately, that moisturizer doesn't have SPF in it so I decided to try this sunscreen.  My skin isn't sensitive, but it could not handle this sunscreen. I experienced terrible breakouts around my jawline (which has never happened before) and it took a long time for my skin to clear.

I am a fan of Mario B's products, just not this one… * This is the most misunderstood sunscreen. It is so beautiful and lightweight. The glow is so  amazing! It wears beautifully under makeup too! * has a white cast… * I am always looking for a good mineral sunscreen. The ladies at Ulta recommended this one -and they were right! 
Lightweight, blends easily, slight white cast when first applied (I expect that with a mineral formula) but after waiting the requisite 15 minutes-it has disappeared into my skin. 
Good price point too * I've finally found a sunscreen that works for me. Mineral sunscreen tends to leave a white cast, but I did not have that with this one. I can layer it on top of my serums and moisturizer with no pilling, and it extremely lightweight compared to what I've used in the past. I generally hate using sunscreen, too, but this one is so easy to use that I can see myself using it all year long (as we should be protecting our skin, even in the winter months). I'm also prone to acne and cysts, and I have yet to have a problem and I've been using this stuff since May."

This is the first product that not only works, but dont make my hair look like a grease pit AND feels great on my scalp. I have porcelain pale skin that is very sensitive. The elixer does not bother my skin at all while providing great protection and it feels so nice in my hair! Im so happy with this oil!! * love that it includes spf * I love this product. It is lightweight. It is easy to apply and make sure you didn't miss a spot. It also absorbs quickly and doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy. * Super hydrating my skin loves it! I definitely recommend using this product! * Love the glow that it leaves and how moisturizing it feels * I have oily skin but this doesn't make me feel greasy. I use about 5 drops and my skin feels very moisturized afterwards. Will definitely buy again. * This is lightweight, nourishes the skin, leaves 0 white cast and is non greasy. I even use it on my scalp when my locs have been freshly retied to protect it from the sun as well. It also works well under makeup and is easy to reapply if needed. I definitely recommend"

But i cannot get past the smell. It has the scent of a hardware store. Would not recommend. * it was a perfect product for this summer and the cream smelled very good * I tried this product for few weeks now and i can totally see how my skin has improved, love it!! * It goes on smooth and doesnt leave a white case. The packaging is super cute * I absolutely loved Undefined Beauty's R&R mineral sunscreen, I found the shade was perfect, didn't really notice a string scent & helped with protecting my skins Barrier while protecting it sun's harmful rays! 
It definitely a must try with its fabulous skincare ingredient list! I love that it gave such beauty dewy glow to my skin. * I've been using this for a few weeks now and I definitely enjoy it. It works in easy and leaves no cast. The smell is a light 'pleasant summer pool day' type of scent that dissipates quickly. I'm not sure what ""skin type"" I have but it tends be be on the oily side. If you have a similar type, I'd advise less is more for this product. There is a very fine line between greasy and glow."

I don't notice any color tho. So nice for a sunscreen that sinks into your skin but my skin looks no different in tone after putting it on. * This is super lightweight, moisturizing, and easy to blend. It doesn't have a noticeable tint once its applied, and the spf level is great for everyday use but not prolonged sun exposure. A lot of reviews mention whitecast or pilling- I haven't had issues with either. I am very pale though. I only use it with other pacifica products, which might help prevent pilling. It's nice but I'll probably opt for the spf30 lotion once I run out. * apples like chalk * Actyally the worst sunscreen ever :( HORRIBLE white cast and pilled an insane amount. I waited for all of my products to absorb before putting this on and it still pilled like crazy and left an AWFUL white cast * I love Pacifica's Vitamin Sea SPF and was looking for a less oily version, but unfortunately this SPF leaves an awful white cast despite it being tinted * Really great spf for sensitive and acne prone skin but it leaves an insane white cast on my face that's really difficult to blend. I'm medium with a neutral undertone and I wear kosas foundation in 200 for reference."

I have had some sunscreens that are too oily and make me shiny or break out and it doesn't do that. But it has a white cast and peels. Not good under makeup either. Overall pass. * At first i loved it except the strong fragrance. After a week of use its leaving ny skin burning. I hope i can return. I really wantes to be able to use this because i do like the consistency and how quickly it absorbs. * I love the clean ingredients, it leaves no white cast, feels light on the skin, and doesn't make my makeup pill! Seriously my ride or die."
