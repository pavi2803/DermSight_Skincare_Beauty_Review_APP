1,1,nyx professional makeup,lip lingerie xxl long-lasting matte liquid lipstick,pimprod2024490,2578930,"  No, not really.  You didn't have the one I wanted. This was the closes matt color to what I wanted. I had never purchased this brand before.  It's very thick and it flakes.  A little brighter than expected but last about 4 to 5 hours. Less expensive than what I have been using.  Good product and last long.  Goes on smooth with a matte look.  The reason for 4-star rating is because they changed the color that I normally wear.... now way too dark.  Oh.My.Gosh! The fricking pigment is crazy! This lasts all day and is kinda hard to get off not going to lie! Although this lipstick is long lasting, it does take a bit to dry if you use a substantial amount! I really like this product because you can make your lips very dark, if you use alot, or make them light, if you use a little.  Untamable is a beautiful, true red. It glides on nicely, dries down quickly, doesn't transfer, and even lasts through a meal. The only downside is that it is a little dry but that is a small price for the color payoff and longwear. And the üçí on top is the price. This lipstick is an incredible value.  this is one of my favorite cheap matte long lasting lippie I use to buy stila but it's kind of expensive and this is a cheaper version of something I like  idk what is the hype but after about a month, formula starts to dry. When on lips, it peels very bad. I tried multiple colors, including the black one. save money and go for another product."
2,2,mac,m√Ç¬∑a√Ç¬∑cximal silky matte lipstick,pimprod2043558,2621407,"  i like how easily it went on. long lasting and matte finished look. it didn't dry out like others and has a creamy feel. i'd definitely recommend!  Great colors, goes on smooth and at a decent price.  It's too drying for me, but can't wait to try in a satin finish!!  100/10. Whirl is the most beautiful shade that would look good on all shades. The wear is good too! I get compliments everytime I wear this, it goes with every makeup look, ive used this shade for over 10 years. Get it!!!!üíóüíóüíóüíó  Honey love is my favorite pinky nude! 
The new packaging feels lux and seems a bit bigger. 
The formula is smooth and buttery, color last quiet a bit on the lips.  Transfer is minimal.  I'm so sad that this is the second lipstick that broke on me. I was applying it on with very little of the lipstick out when it shifted all the way from the bottom. I was thinking.. what just happened. I shifted the lipstick sideways when it all fell out. This was maybe only the second time I had applied it on. I was very upset because I really love the color. I got ""Chilli"" and I really like how it looks. I just put it back into the lipstick holder and will continue to use it. I'm very disappointed in the quality of this product for how much it cost and the prestige it carries, I expect more!  Shade Lady Danger has a formula that is so soft that it breaks. This is now the third lipstick in this particular shade I've tried and it always either comes broken or breaks in demo. Do not buy! You will end up either spending double on a second lipstick to replace this one when it inevitably breaks."
3,3,rabanne,dramalips glassy lipstick,pimprod2045103,2623335,"  I bought the drama lips in the shade go bankrupt. I love the shade but there's not as much shine as it claims to have. With that being said this does have fantastic wear time and fades nicely. I do recommend using a lip liner and maybe a lip primer.  I have no tie or bias to this brand, I've actually never heard of it before‚Ä¶ But I am a lip product junkie so I decided to try this product and I absolutely love it. The shade first date is such a beautiful, every day color, especially for my fellow brown girls ü§é - besides the shade I also really enjoy the formula, it applies smoothly and can be built up for a more opaque look. The staying power is great; now this is not transfer proof, but if you don't touch your lips, it lasts for a resonable amount of time, it stayed on  through a sweaty workout.  Super happy with this purchase. It glides on, doesn't dry out my lips, and the color is spot on. My only problem? I got it two days ago and can't find it anymore. üòÇü´† Time to purchase another, I guess!  The color payoff is beautiful, and so far has been hydrating on my lips. Reference I do have dry lips."
4,4,tarte,maracuja juicy lip cr√É¬®me,pimprod2036935,2604716,"  I'm a lip balm/ lip gloss kind of girl. When I tell you any of these shades are amazing! Including the PH changing ones! The coverage is insane, super Lucious and glossy and last for hours!! Def a must have if you love a Lucious, juicy lip!  I was told it was a long lasting lip stick but it isn't. Very expensive for a mediocre product.  After speaking with an in store consultant,.this product was recommended for my age. I stated that I did not want lipstick that ran into the lines around my mouth and that's exactly what it did. Returned to the store. Not impressed.  Not a long lasting color at all  So glad the consultant showed me this color and the fact it is a Matt finish. It is a lasting color, but not sticky  I love this lip creme! It makes my lips feel great and it looks so great. It is a bit pricey but I love it.  For the price of this lipstick I would expect more lasting color.  My maybelline works just as well."
5,5,lanc√É¬¥me,l'absolu rouge cream lipstick,pimprod2030262,2590100,"  Better! I had been using the same Lanc√¥me lipstick for decades. But I think that it was time for a change!  Used to be called champaign.  Love how subtle the color is. How it goes with all type of makeup color palettes.  Very moist and the color is a perfect nude! 
I would give it five stars if it stayed on longer.  I have been using this beautiful color for 30 years. It goes with all colors of clothes! Wears great, beautiful on!  I am have lip sensitivity to products. I went in looking for a clean product... was directed to this lipstick. Not clean- still had a reaction.  Favorite classic lipstick! I've been wearing the same shade for over a year"
6,6,charlotte tilbury,matte revolution lipstick,pimprod2043355,2619356,"  amazing!!  This lipstick is long lasting but it is a matt lipstick so it is a little drying (at least for me). I have to make sure to use a lip sleeping mask to make sure my lips are conditioned really good. I love lipstick and have stuff ranging from dollar store, drug store and lux. My advice is if you have never tried a lux lipstick and are curious, you can probably skip this one. I have lipstick from the dollar store that I reach for over this one.  I'm  disappointed in this one! I have  2 other lipsticks in this line. They are more moisturizer.  I ended up  tossing it out. Maybe it's  the manufacturers fault!  This is my second favorite color of her line. It definitely feels like moisture on my lips. I would buy it again!  I would buy this one again!  I love the shade, however I wish this was more hydrating! It feels dry and flakey soon after applied and doesn't last.  Literally my new fav lipstick"

8,8,kylie cosmetics,matte lip kit,pimprod2026503,2583997,"  Love the product it is my favorite. Shade perfect, pricey but worth it.  absolutely love it  Felt like a wet and wild product super cheap  Love it  Buy it !!  Love Kylie lipkits! However the formula is VERY VERY drying! But if you can get past that you'll have a lipstick that lasts you ALLLL day long!  This is very drying."
9,9,chanel,le rouge duo ultra tenue ultrawear liquid lip colour,pimprod2029989,2532593,"  Nothing has come close to the staying power of this lipstick. Ive been using it as a base color for over 10 years. 
I layer it with the gloss or another lipstick. Lasts throughout the day.  Sticky after application, transfers, wears off unevenly and very quickly.  Amazing, long lasting color. Beautiful and comfortable with the glissy topcoat. Worth the money for the nuanced shades and quality.  I just bought this lipstick a few days ago in the color 154 And I cannot put it down!! Its such a beautiful rich color. The pigment is great. It feels super luxe. It also lasts through eating and drinking. What more could a girl want!? I will be grabbing more colors 100%.  I have in 2 colors and they are very rich in color. I love them.  I love these lip glosses!!!! They stay on for hours!  Best lipstick I have ever used and I've tried them all! Stays all day and moisturizes lips as well. Going to buy more colors"

11,11,clinique,pop longwear lipstick,pimprod2043385,2619998,"  Clinique lipsticks are my favorite. The store had a nice inventory of colors.  Wouldn't buy it again but pretty lipstick color  Beautiful color  A friend suggested I try this lipstick and he was so right. Wonderful day lipstick. Love the feel and so far seems to wear well. Sales woman was very helpful in finding the right shade. Definitely going back  I was looking for a new shade for summer and this was recommended - nice, light application and fun color for summer  Unfortunately, I would not purchase this product again.  It is matte and leaves your lips too dry for my liking.
I have to say that the pigment is great and does last for a good portion of the day.  Through the years I have always like Clinique lipstick as I can always find a good color that's natural looking.  I have never been one to go with a really bold color.  Its also very smooth and creamy."
12,12,dior,addict lipstick,pimprod2036809,2604220,"  I see this more as a pigmented lip balm its creamy and glides well but since its creamy it sets into the cracks of your lips and doesnt last as much  Nice. Creamy.  Not worth almost $50.  There are so many others to choose from.  Won't buy again  Glides smoothly  I was really hoping to like this for the cost and I usually love dior makeup products, but this one is just okay. The formula is nice and it has good pigment, but the color isnt as pictured/described. I probably wouldn't buy this again.  I got this as a gift and I love it. It's very mousturizing, stains the lips beautifully and the case is so cute.l definitely will be purchasing more shades.  I have several dior lipsticks, and have had several others over the years searching for my perfect nude. I do not have a lot of pigment in my lips and am pretty fair skinned so everything shows up on me, and fairly true to color. The shade 418 Beige Oblique is my most perfect nude!!! I am 42 years old and it hides the vertical lines in my lips so well while being smooth, glossy and almost moisturizing. Although the tone is cool/neutral, it can go so well with even warm tone eyeshadow looks because the lipstick is about my perfect match of color to the inside of my lips. This is really a, ""my lips but WAY better"" type of lipstick for me. I am so worried that this shade will be discontinued because that is what happens with literally everything that works for me. I can't believe after 30 years if wearing makeup, I have finally found my perfect lipstick. Love Dior!  Does not last 6 hours like I was told - more like 60 minutes"

15,15,milani,color fetish matte lipstick,pimprod2025973,2581813,"  Not sure why ive waited this long to purchase but i really love this formula and color pay off.  The color 'Peony' with a brown lip liner looks stunning. The formula is great as well, glides smoothly , the finish is velvet matt.  Nice color though for some reason it looked different in store and at home. I made sure to get a fully packaged lipstick but when I opened it at home the tip had been smushed.  Not impressed.  I loved the texture of the lipstick and how it doesn't dry out your lips. It gives a pretty good amount of product and I truly believe it is better then high-end makeup  This lipstick is a new fav! The formula goes on smoothly, the color is gorgeous and the quality is top notch. Will be returning to purchase other shades!  My holy grail fav lipstick is the charlotte tilbury pillowtalk lipstick and this is an amazing and affordable alternative! The color is super similar and goes on smooth. 10/10, a drugstore fav."

17,17,milani,color fetish balm lipstick,pimprod2021061,2573965,"  Love the color. Love that it stays on all day! Definitely need to use make up remover to take it off at night as it stays on and on!!!  Love the case.  I got the color covet on clearance. I don't know if it was a bad or old batch or what, because it felt exactly like wiping sand on my lips and was the most horrible feeling thing I've ever put on. I will be returning it and will never purchase these again.  Nylon (top pics, with a little brown liner) and Lingerie (bottom pics) in 2 different lighting on my olive-warm skin. Love this product, underrated. Balm-lipstick indeed. Color is true on website, but my lips tend to be semi-pale except for top lip.  This lipstick felt horrible. It has a sandpaper feel on my lips.  I love these balms! Very hydrating with lots of pigment. Fantastic colors!  Love this lipstick! It's my favorite! It's perfect for everyday wear. It's easy to wear and not drying at all. You will need to reapply after eating. Also, the Lingerie color is like your lip color but better!  Some Nyx lip products irritate, too."
18,18,mac,lustreglass sheer-shine lipstick,pimprod2026837,2584414,"  Some of these colors are irreplaceable!!! Nothing like them. There are no dupes. I have tried hard to find dupes. I believe myth was discontuned and peach blossom and cherish are hard to find. I would stock up. I'm devadtated that myth is no more.  Did not stay on 8 minutes let alone 8 hours  This lipstick is beautiful it feel very smooth pn my lips and it isn't really dark. It blends out so beautiful, shiny or you can dull it down a bit with tapping motions with your finger. I am on my way to buying more!!  I absolutely love this lipstick.. the color , a warm brick red, was recommended by the sales associate, Sydney.. and I am quite pleased with the shade, and ease of application!  If you want. 10/10 lipstick then buy it.  I have been wearing this color for many years  This lip color was more solid than with a pearl finish and darker once applied than expected."
19,19,nyx professional makeup,shine loud vegan high shine long-lasting liquid lipstick,pimprod2020796,2565892,"  good liquid lipstick without any transfer. Ordered 4 but 2 lipsticks was already used. What people says online about ULTA putting returns inventory back on the shelf for sale is true just be careful!!!  Makes my lips full and shiny‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so kissable!  I saw similar color with MAC...REFUSED to pay MAC price$34.  Found this and it lasts and is 1/3 price!!!! Hello?  idk if I should recommend this or not it is LONG LASTINGG!!! Don't try this on unless you want it on for hours to come. no make ip wipes and pil cleanser will not help lol.
but beautiful color and you need to apply both together. Just applying the lipstick without gloss will make it sticky  First, the colors online don't align with the true colors. For example, the one I bought, ""Fierce Flirt,"" shows as a sort of light pink online but it's much more muted in person. I also don't like how the packaging isn't super clear about the nature of the product. The color dries down to a no-budge, rubbery lip color and the clear side is just a clear gloss. The gloss applicator is a plastic brush which is sorta weird but I don't mind it. The formula stays put (you're not getting it off once it dries) but it definitely still flakes off on the inner lip and isn't super comfy to wear. I would recommend as a budget option for a smooth longwear liquid lipstick but not necessarily for anyone who isn't excited about having a rubbery somewhat flakey layer on their lips all day.  these are by far the longest lasting liquid lipsticks I've ever used and I've sued quite a bit. after an entire day I didn't have to reapply at all except just the inner ring of my bottom lip but that part on my body always needs a touch up. I wholeheartedly recommend this product!  Left my lips feeling sticky"

24,24,charlotte tilbury,k.i.s.s.i.n.g lipstick,pimprod2043358,2619409,"  This is exactly what I've been waiting for‚Ä¶ For us extremely fair skinned lovelies ""pillow talk"" looks very warm and dark rose. This is so perfect!!! The lipliner is a must as well! I can guarantee you I will never stop buying this! If you are in the fair shade range, and love a good nude lip- go get it! You're welcome in advance!  When CT came out with the new colors, i bought three of them: Icon Baby, Red Carpet Pink, and Candy Chic. I love them all but Candy Chic is my favorite. Then, she comes out with Pillow Talk Fair!  I got it right away and fell in love. It quickly replaced my Pillow Talk, which I've been using for years. Thankfully she also came out with a gloss in Pillow Talk Fair as well. So beautiful.  I got my first charlotte tilbury lipstick in the shade Nude Romance. A perfect ""my lips but better"" shade. I really like this particular formula, the satin finish wears very nice and is very forgiving for my dry dry skin. 
It doesnt have a ton of staying power but it is still very beautiful!  This is the perfect color, perfect consistency, perfect texture. I've already ordered another one as a backup!  I have matte revolution (pillow talk & pillow talk med), but I absolutely fell in love with this formula and with the shade b*tch perfect!  For me, it is the perfect shade!  It has taken me a lot of trial & error to finc my perfect shade‚Ä¶but thjs dahlings!!  It is the one!  PS i also love Penelope Pink and Icon Baby but B*tch Perfect is my desert island!  I love this lipstick.  Its creamy snd a beautiful color.  Pillow Talk Fair: THIS is the shade of pink I've been searching for! I have tried many lip products tring to find the shade that looks exactly like this on my lips. Many I've tried previously all pull peach or nude on my skin tone. I am so happy to now have found the perfect for me shade."
25,25,anastasia beverly hills,lip velvet full-pigment lip mousse,pimprod2042909,2618187,"  So bummed bevause i love the look however it caused an allergic reaction and now i can hardly wear lipsticks!  I have 5 shades in these lipsticks. They are Absolute Perfection in a Liquid lipstick. This new formula does not dry out your lips. Lasts all day long and comes in the most Stunning  Muted Matte Colors. I first bought the shade Softy and it was the most gorgeous muted pink with just a touch of peach. I loved it and just had to try more. I then bought  Pink Sand and Peachy Nude. Absolutely beautiful. Pink sand has a hint more pink like a soft pink brown and the peachy nude has a soft hint of pink. Reminds me of Snashbox Always on Liquid Lipsticks in the shade Fair Game. If you know, you know.
I then purchased Pure Hollywood and Parchment. PureHollywood is a beautiful pinky mauve with a nit of brown and Parchment is that gorgeous burnt orange with a hint of brownish red.
I love every shade absolutely beautiful.  They cteate this sort of blurring effect on the lips is hard to desribe. Right up there with the Smashbox Liquid lipsticks and Dose of Colors but dare I say even more comfortable.
These are a bit pricey so get them on sale or when the 20% coupons roles around but they are worth it.
These with ABH new cream blushes especially the shade Latte is everything!
I highly recommend!  Great color great texture! 
Want more colours  Really wish it didnt hurt my lips. Love this product just developed an allergy to it. 

I didn't use it for a month to make sure. 
After wearing it my upper lip becomes irritated and blisters.  This has a soft and creamy texture. The color is spot on. I'm wearing pure Hollywood.  I love it it's so comfortable ‚ù§Ô∏è i have two shades ill buy all of the shades!  Received Peachy Nude & Parchment. Not a fan. The only positive attribute is that you don't *really* feel like you have anything on, but otherwise they're dry, settle in any dry spots on my lips, and the peachy nude screams beef-lips, even though I'm very fair toned."
26,26,kvd beauty,everlasting hyperlight vegan transfer-proof liquid lipstick,pimprod2034060,2598998,"  PLEASE, if this brand does anything, bring back the old formula. This lipstick used to be my holy grail, until they switched formulas and it's TERRIBLE. Ever heard of the saying, ""If it aint broke, don't fix it?"" BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA, KVD. üôÑ  Ghost bloom looks like a super purple color when it's described as plum brown. The formula has changed from the old kvd I agree with others saying you need several layers of this. The packaging is pretty but feels light and cheap. Considering returning because it's not flattering.  Queen of Poisons is supposed to be the new name for the shade, Lolita, however, it is nowhere near the original Lolita shade. Very disappointing and will be returning.  The new lolita (queen of poisons) is nowhere near the shade of the old lolita. Very disappointing and will have to return!  It goes on smoothly and smells delicious like a cupcake or something. Very black. Perfect matte consistency.  KVD lipstick is my favorite but the lipstick is totally different than before. It's not as pigmented so you have to apply layers, which eventually makes your lips dry and lipstick turns flaky. I miss the old KVD liquid lipstick.  I have tried many lipsticks over the years and none of them can compare to the KVD Hyperlight Liquid Lipstick. It truly is lightweight and has wonderful pigment. It makes my lips feel smooth and sometimes I forget I'm even wearing it. I have multiple lipstick shades and I love them all!"
27,27,l'oreal,colour riche original satin lipstick,2681,2617006,"  I like all colors available. Nice lipstick.  Always searching for something 'better,' I tried Loreal Color Riche Original on a whim, after using top name brands for years. To my surprise, this product stayed on and looking fresh after a whole cup of coffee and breakfast! I absolutely love the color too. My lips feel smooth and silky and the color does not bleed.  Love this lipstick. So happy it was still available and that I could find it at Ulta !  I love the lipstick, it's rich and goes on smooth. The color lasts and it has a nice shine.  I've worked in cosmetics for a long time, I love this lipstick. Lasts a long time and doesn't bleed throughout the day.  This formula is absolutely divine. So creamy and lasts a long time too.  Honestly, I really like this lipstick! I find it very smooth, and I love the color, it looks really good and feels really nice on the lips"

29,29,anastasia beverly hills,long-wearing matte & satin velvet lipstick,pimprod2030578,2604144,"  This is by far the best red I have ever purchased. The color is sophisticated and elegant. It's a color I can wear day or night. I'm mixed with black and white and to find a color that matches my skin tone can be challenging at times.  This has a pleasant smell, but that's the only good thing I can say. It it not long-lasting, and it bleeds off my lips so I look like a drunk who smeared lipstick all over! The color, Rose Bloom, is more peachy on me, which is not what I wanted. I'll be returning. It's more of a gloss than a lipstick.  Love the Sugar Plum Shade this is a great lipstick overall! Not too drying and a quality matte lipstick. Color is generally accurate with the swatch photos.  wearing.. Disappointed  This lipstick melts. The colors are gorgeous so I purchased two. What a huge disappointment. I need to throw them both out. I never ever had that happen with dependable brands like Este Lauder. Don't fall for great colors and trendy names.  The toffee is a perfect brick red for this cool toned silver-haired lady! My most flattering lipstick and it feels like a dream on the lips.  I bought this due to all the positive feedbacks ..but how disappointing this is after dring anything it comes off.. it states long wear NOT!!!!! You have to do better ill go back to Mac at least there's is long wear‚Ä¶  I truly wanted to like this Brand‚Ä¶. But not gonna work on me ‚Ä¶) Dont waist your money if your looking for long wear"
30,30,bobbi brown,crushed lip color moisturizing lipstick,pimprod2024879,2583569,"  I love this lipstick I got it in color blush and its perfect to put on and go. Its smooth very sheer color. Will purchase again. Very smooth on lips not sticky at all. Love it  Genuinely, I had given up on lipstick completely. I found this brand's tinted lip balm, and fell in love so hard that I looked for what else was in store in lips, and when I saw the colors this brand had to offer? I HAD to try it. And to my UTMOST pleasure, the lipstick was absolutely wonderful. Everything other lipsticks wish they could be. The natural colors are to be adored, and the lipstick does not feel as cakey and thick as others have for me in the past. Also, the Ruby is the very first red that I've liked on myself, ever. The only bad thing I have to say is, I am sad I don't own all of them!  I am low key neutral kind of gal and this is beautiful to wear with a gloss on top.. got it in Italian Rose and it's beautiful on‚Ä¶ stays with a gloss I am not a touch up gal so it stays for my day‚Ä¶  Does not cover lips well.  Excellent product  I hate to say this but I just purchased this lipstick and it tastes so bad, almost like beef tallow. The scent is terrible. I'm not sure how people buy this. Also I got a new one thinking it went rancid and nope just nasty.  This lipstick has a really buildable, sheer, color. I really like the natural finish. The only con is that it can be slightly drying, I just moisturize well overnight."

32,32,beautycounter,sheer genius conditioning lipstick,pimprod2038187,2606537,"  Sadly, I returned this lipstick. Ulta did not have samples available to see what the color was and when I was able to try it on, way too light for my medium skin tone. It did feel smooth and great coverage with two quick swipes. I will Ulta had samples available of the other colors available. It had a medium beige appearance, but was much lighter on. Color Pearl I would not recommend for medium skin tone. Would work if you are really fair.  I love little taste, and color of this lipstick! Totally is worth th money  Feels very nice on your lips, but color is so subtle that it should be called lip balm, not lipstick. Glad I purchased on sale because I wouldn't pay the full price for it.  I have used Beautycounter products since the first year of the company.  Sadly, they seem to discontinue every product I love.  Assuming this was just like my favorite BC lipstick, I ordered two.  Nope.  This formula is sheer and super drying.  I don't know a sheer lip product is drying but this is. I had to reapply often and then just gave up after two days and returned it.  Maybe someday BC will bring back all the good stuff.  Purchased 2 colors, orchid and lily. was so excited to get this in mail. This is more like lipstick, not sheer at all. it felt heavy and I could smell a vanilla scent.  I have always used Nars afterglow balm ( which is not a lipstick texture nor a gloss,...just a perfect mix of both with great color and moisture) in many colors and was hoping beauty counter would be very similar and I would have a few new colors. Bummed and back they go. A plus is BC is clean beauty.  They do have some fab products.  This is the BEST lipstick ever! Most other lipsticks (even the ones that are not matte) dry out my lips. However, this product moisturizes my lips and has a lovely scent. I have bought several shades and they ALL look great on me! Plus, this product is verified by the Environmental Working Group! People, we need to be conscious of what we put on (and in) our bodies! Please support the companies that recognize this, and create products to help us!  Great lip product.  Goes on great, lasts and feels good on your lips - not too sticky or tacky.  Clean too which makes it a huge bonus, especially for something you're putting on your lips!"

34,34,kylie cosmetics,velvet lip kit,pimprod2036757,2585658,"  It dried out my lips.  Love the color and the amount of time it stays on , but it does transfer  I was pleasantly surprised about how great this lip kit is-has great saturation of color and stays on great -I am hard to please and have bought just about everything under the sun  Kylie Jenner has a lot of reputation.  I'm not sure if it's good reputation or bad reputation, but Kylie has a lot of it.  I picked this up because Chase Icon mentioned Kylie lip kits in one of her songs, so I had to know what the buzz was about.  this is a decent lip product.  I like that the product goes on easy and that the gloss and liner are a perfect match.  I'm not sure this is the best lip product at Ulta, but it does the job, and it looks nice.  Grabbed this as an impulse buy. I didn't want to like it but this beats out my previous longwear lipstick like crazy!  I'll definitely buy more colors! The liner is amazing alone or with the lipstick  I just gave a two star review for kylies lip oil, so this is not a bias review. I don't where makeup often and my lips are small in size. I wanted to buy one of kylies lip kits to try out. I wanted a more smooth velvet look rather than matte. I landed on the harmony velvet lip kit. first time user and I will be repurchasing this set along with different shades. both the lip liner and lipstick gloss glides on lips for easy application. the lipstick locks on your lips and does not smug or get on your teeth. I've drank and ate food and the lipstick has not left my lips. last all day. both the liner and liquid lipstick pair very well together ‚ù§Ô∏è üíã üíÑ xoxo  From the creaminess of the lip liner to the staying power of the lip stick. I get compliments every time I wear this shade! It's slightly matte without being dry."
35,35,maybelline,superstay ink crayon lipstick,pimprod2006734,2558100,"  Love the color and the staying power. It doesn't leave my lips dry and does last all day. It didn't rub off and just popped so nicely.  I love this product so much! The shade I use is called ""Break the Ceiling"" and it is such a gorgeous deep pink. The applicator is perfect for getting all around your lip! When applied, depending on your lighting it might look orange at first but once you step out into natural/white lighting you will see the dark pink. To really make the pink pop I add a lipgloss on top (similar color), and the ink crayon still stays on and lasts for a long time.  For me, this a convinient size of a lipstick I can throw in my purse, also this is a beautiful long wear lipstick and does'nt dry your lips at all. Beautiful colors too  It doesn't look good on dark toned women  ive repurchased this lipstick in multiple shades because i love the formula abs shade range so much- it applys smoothly and does not budge. it looks great with a glossy top or on its own as a matte look.  First time using this product and would definitely buy again.  Super easy to use and also great for travel or to keep in your purse for quick touch ups  I was very hesitant of the color because i don't usually wear red, however this product completely changed my mind. Its super creamy, soft and lasted well even after eating a giant baked potato.
give it 4 instead of 5 because I did notice i have to reapply a little bit occasionally. I wore mine with lip liner though thats personal preference. There is a slight scent to it when you smell it from the pencil, but I didn't notice it while wearing it. I think the best part that i loved was the sharpener! I really wanna get more now in different shades."

37,37,urban decay cosmetics,vice hydrating lipstick,pimprod2026577,2584543,"  I was really excited after reading reviews of this lipstick. I'm on the hunt for a red lip that I can wear all day and can withstand eating/drinking. This fell short of my expectations. The color payoff is wonderful and it feels good on the lips, but it's definitely not transfer proof/resistent, and seemed to fade fast at the corners. The tube is also a little awkward to deal with.  I put purchased this lipstick in Ravenswood after seeing it on a friend. It's my new favorite.  ""Local"" is the perfect pink! Excellent formula, goes on smoothly and shiny, lasts for hours. Keeps my lips moist and feeling healthy. I have bought this item several times and will purchase again. Definitely worth the price.  It has a beautiful texture, I will definitely buy this brand again.  I will try another color.  This is one of my favorite lipstick formulas, i always stock up when theyre on sale. They all have great formulas. The high shine ones have great color pay off and are very moisturizing. The satin and matte are also high pigment and very comfortable, and i usuallt cant stand matte formulas because i hate dry lip products! The packaging is a little bulky but not too bad  This lipstick goes on smooth and lasting with a beautiful color which does not smear!  I honestly think this is the best lipstick and color I've ever purchased! Stays on and on!"
38,38,mac,locked kiss ink lipstick,pimprod2037470,2604777,"  I have used MAC for many years. This product is new and not as effective as others have been. I like the color but it is not as long lasting as they have been in the past.  I normally don't write reviews, but this product is definitely smudge proof! Color is beautiful and lasted through the entire day including after meals and workouts. Exactly what I was looking for! It's a little drying but not too much.  I tried this product twice, once recommended by Ulta. I went back after it didn't stay, she showed me how it stays. I tried again, did not stay.   Then the next day after wearing it, this appeared. It is going back.  Receive compliments daily and love how it has a built in lipliner,and stays on all day.I liked this so much I purchased 2 of these 

~catie  Loved the color but the lipstick comes off extremely fast.  After the first drink, the middle of my lips were faded. The color transferred to my cup and smeared at the corners of my mouth. I will not be repurchasing.  This lipstick DID NOT stay on for hardly an hour much less 24 hours! For the price I paid, it was worthless! Don't waste your money, If I could give it no stars I would."

40,40,nyx professional makeup,smooth whip blurring matte lip cream,pimprod2034177,2598838,"  This was a new product to me, and the color was definitely a little shocking, however the lip cream does have a pretty great coverage.  Very hydrating on the lips!! Only con is does come off when eating or drinking but I do not mind it since it feels great every time I put on my lips  I initially loved this due to the comfortability and color payoff. However, it does wear off after a while, especially noticeable with the brighter colors (like red). If you don't plan on eating or drinking, and wanting a few hours of wear, then this would be fine. Not an all day kind of lipstick!  This reminds me of a cream matte lipstick. The colors are beautiful and they look nice but won't last like a liquid lip. You will have to reapply through out the day on the lips if you are doing things with your mouth like eating. I personally don't use it on my lips I use it as a cream lipstick and it sets well and last all day.  I am OBSESSED with the entire Smooth Whip line up, so much so that I've purchased 10 different colors. The colors are beautiful, and this particular formula goes on smoothly and is SUPER comfortable to wear all day. The ONLY reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because some of the colors are better than others. IDK why, but some of the colors seem to be more sheer than others and require an additional coat or two to get the true color. In terms of consistency and overall color, Blankie is the best one out of the bunch. One swipe on my upper and lower lip, and I have beautiful baby blue lips. I hope NYX NEVER discontinues this product line or the Blankie color. If anything I hope they add more colors in the future, like lime green or black.  Was looking for matte it appeared not to dry kept a wet look or shine on my lips 
Was just trying something different from Maybelline Matte Superstay Ink which I love and purchase there also  I have three colors of these that I have bought since getting the sample one.  The cherry red is nice but popping.   The pink I got was too bright.  The mocha is nice but it completely matches my skin tone.   I have tried layering to tone down the pink but it gets too thick.   As for feel, I love it."

42,42,buxom,full-on satin lipstick,pimprod2040581,2610397,"  The pigment is great.  Feels smooth on.  Love it!  I feel like Buxom gets slept on as a brand but they have fantastic lip products. I loved the previous Full-On Lipsticks and still wear what I have left, but these new ones are even better. They are super moisturizing and i love the colors. I got Skin Tease and the new Limited Edition Pink Crush and i love thek both. Skin Tease is a perfect nude. Im looking forward to trying mire colors.  Dried out my lips. Will be returning.  The color is great for me.  I will probably purchase it again.  I love the smooth application and the color selection.  I was excited to try this pipstick and it did not disappoint.  Doesn't last all day, but I wasn't expecting it to.  Stays smooth and is lightweight.  This formula is my absolute go to for lipstick now. I have wayyyy too many lip products but I constantly reach for this formula!

43,43,nars,afterglow sensual shine lipstick,pimprod2038271,2608908,"  Honestly all NARS products do amazing. Most of my makeup is from this brand! Can never go wrong with their lip balms, lipsticks and glosses  I may actually return this item. As other reviews are stating, Devotion does not look anything like the description. its like a light nude. And I am pretty underwhelmed with the pigmentation. Seems more to me like a balm than a lipstick.  I went into ulta not expecting to buy lipstick but i sampled Voyeur and it went perfect with my skin tone. I always go for pinks, but I cant get enough of this. Im fair skinned with blond hair. I wish it lasted a little longer thats all. Now, what lipliner should i use?  I ordered ""Devotion"" online which is supposed to be a pink shade (mauve rose).  The lipstick arrives and is labeled ""Devotion"" but it is a brown orangey shade!  I would never have purchased this shade in person.  It looks more like ""Voyeur"" instead of ""Devotion"" if you are looking simply at the colors online.  I will be returning as soon as I can.  Too much like lip gloss. Not enough pigment.  I purchased the No Inhibitions Raspberry Pink and absolutely love it!  I usually go for lighter shades and was reluctant to purchase this color, but it is my new signature color!  My lips needed a product that provided intense moisture and this product excelled!  I am so happy with this purchase.  It effortlessly glides on and will continue purchasing this same exact product!  I love the formula of this lipstick, its glossy and moisturizing but the pigment is amazing and its not slippery and greasy and longer lasting than I thought it would be. I bought the shade orgasm and want to try a few other shades as well"
44,44,fenty beauty by rihanna,icon velvet liquid lipstick,pimprod2038220,2606946,"  I love the color & how it matches my makeup BUT it smells like fish. So disgusting. It's very messy as well; thick formula that trasnfers easily. Honestly disappointed because this is my first Fenty purchase.  Love  I love all of Fenty Beauty's lip orosucts but i am for sure returning this one. I love a matte liquid lip and saw that tje finish on this was velvet but when I tell you the formula is SO THICK it made me gag - it wasn't for me!  I wanted to love this lipstick so badly! The color is to die for!!! Unfortunately, it has a HORRIBLE fish odor! I am definitely not trying to have that on my lips! Not transfer proof is a big con for me as well, but I was willing to deal with that for the color- until I smelled it!!  I was at a restaurant two weeks ago and saw the product on  on an employee there.  She was rocking it 100 percent.  I inquired about it.  She told me ""yes, you could wear this""; lol!   ""Miss Gail"" gave me the name of the color and where she purchased it. I love the way it looks on me!  Thank You, Both!!!!  I bought this for its rating on ewg. I really want to get away from toxins and Fenty has many non toxic products. I like the color and it lasted a long time. It dries down matte, which i like, and it doesnt dry out my lips. Others complain that it bleeds. I think lining the lips with a liner helps with that because i didn't have that issue. Overall im pleased. There arent many non toxic products out there so im happy with it.  The shades are amazing, long lasting, and I only need two or three dots to fill in my entire lips. I've learned that if you put too much when it will smudge it's not proof and it doesn't claim to be so so I don't care"
45,45,charlotte tilbury,hot lips lipstick,pimprod2043360,2619565,"  Kim KW is a beautiful light nude, cool pink shade but the formula is very streaky once applied to the lips. It accentuates lip lines as well. I usually pair it with a dark nude or brown lipliner and blend with a lipstick makeup brush to get rid of the streaks. I'd give it a 3/5 but for the price, find a dupe! Not worth the money.  This is my all time favorite lipstick. This has sparked a new love for lipsticks for me and I plan to purchase more colors.  Beautiful natural lip color !!! üòç"
46,46,urban decay cosmetics,vice lip bond glossy longwear liquid lipstick,pimprod2033818,2598622,"  Despite the lipstick not lasting as long as I would like, its still my absolute favorite. I have gone through three tubes of ""Toy with me""! I always get soo many compliments.  I bought this in cuffed up pink color and it just looks horrible its also has a super sticky feel to it. Ive shaken it up has i should for about a minute and tried it multiple times and still does not look or feel good. Will NOT buy again.  Once I found this formula I fell in love with it, so much I rushed to buy all of the colors I liked except the black.  But to my disappointment the pigmentation disappears even if shaken after a couple of months.  Now they all look like a gloss.  Bought this lip stain and a Dior long lasting lipstick ($50) this one is better than the Dior. You have to remember to shake it. Stays on very long. Super pigmented. Would love more colors! Highly recommend!  The lipstick stays on pretty much for hours and does not dry out my lips.  pretty color but comes off so easily, is tacky and drying. so expensive and disappointing  I shook this tube for five minutes and it still came out patchy and uneven. not even really black at all. immediate refund"
47,47,mac,powder kiss lipstick,pimprod2000550,2535376,"  I've been looking for a color match for my favorite limited edition colourpop lipstick for ages. While the price of this lipstick is much higher, it's the perfect pomegranate shade I've been looking for! It's comfortable, and applied beautifully. I am not typically a MAC product user, but I will definitely be repurchasing this lipstick.  very light, doesn't dry out my lips, stays on pretty good  I was told by a makup artist that MAC was the only lipstick to consider buying.  I was disappointed that it is the same quality as Revlon but more expensive.  vivid red -I am very pleased with my impulse purchase, an I would happily purchase again.  I adore Mac lipsticks, I ordered the shade ""a little tamed"" because it looked like the perfect reddish pink, but in person it looks a bit more like salmon. Not my favorite color but still great lipstick.  I love this lipstick when blotted on the lips, but when i apply it thick like a normal lipstick, the formula really settles into my lips and it is not flattering. i would suggest exfoliating your lips before applying or topping it off with a gloss to look better  Beautiful shades.  Very light almost like a tinted balm.  Looked good when I first applied it but comes off within a half hour.  It comes off instantly if you eat or drink.  Complete waste of money"
48,48,fenty beauty by rihanna,stunna lip paint longwear fluid lip color,pimprod2031429,2592343,"  I love it! Have it in red and it's an amazing color. 
I have the same type of a product from Maybelline, which works good and costs 2,5 times cheaper, but the one from Fenty feels better on my lips and doesn't dry them that much. 
I would recommend it for sure!  I saw Rihanna's Stunna Lip Paint on one of those lists of best this or that. This was described as a universal red lip color for anyone. I have been unable find a classic red lipstick that was not too matte (dry) or too moist (easy to wipe off). For me the color and formulation is perfect. Also, it's so pigmented it only takes a little to give great coverage and it lasts so long, which means the lip paint is worth the investment. As a mature woman I sometimes shy away from the celebrity products because  I felt they are for just for the younger crowd, but I'm 70 and it's working for me,  As stunning as the uncensored color is‚Ä¶this is easily my least favorite lip stick. I applied it, removed all excess liquid, allowed it to dry and it STILL came off on my fingers, cups, straws, around my lips etc. Returning this whether they give me my money back or not.  It's super  Loved this red color I used it before it goes well for any occasions and my own birthday and work day  I have this in five shades, and they all serve a wonderful purpose. Some colors are great for work, and others are amazing for going out. I always get compliments!  this is the second time i but this same color (unbutton) and i love how it looks"

I wish this product came in other colors but i'll 100% be repurchasing either way.  I am a makeup artist and I swear by this product! it is effortlessly beautiful on everyone!  This product is literally so beautiful and long lasting. It has the perfect amount of pigment and the color is just gorgeous. It sits so beautifully on your cheeks it literally looks like your just naturally blushing and it lasts all day on your lips and its so beautifully subtle. If your considering buying this please get it because its so worth it and the product itself lasts so long ive had it for a while now and ive barely made a dent in it!  I was so excited with my purchase but i used 2 days and burned my lips, i feel so sad üòÆ‚Äçüí®üò¢  I love this product so much. I use this as a blush and a lip tint. It is super buildable and I love to use it on my skin with or without makeup.  I love the hue and the formula, I only wish it was better for me out of the tube, I find it works best applied with a firm brush. When I would apply one line and try to blend with my fingers it didn't really want to play and spread; the line was visible. The Brush application gives me more time and a consistent flush of colour and I am actually using less product making this last longer. I love it - I dinged 1 star because I needed to purchase a separate tool to make it a 5 star product.  The color is nice. I like the formula and feel. My biggest annoyance is that its not magnetic. Whats the point of making a match stix that won't stick to the others. I also wish there were more color options"
51,51,chanel,rouge coco flash hydrating vibrant shine lip colour,pimprod2030106,2542582,"  my natural lip colour is a rosy light pink. the shade BOY is the perfect nude match for me, though i think it could fit anyone. it's light yet glowy and glides on like butter. leaves my lips feeling moisturised and smells so beautiful. luxurious!  I loved the color on the stick and it is pretty as it id IMMEDIATELY applied but the color is SO much lighter than it looks on the stick and is EXTREMELY thin. Very soft feeling but you'll need to reapply it every hour if you even make it that far. I found almost the EXACT color flr half the price in both clinic and mac so I find it not worth it for the amount of times it needs to be reapplied and i expected it to be a little bolder of a pigment. I would've kept it if it even had one of those two elements that are most important to me but if you don't mind that then definetly get it. It is pretty. Sorry they wouldn't let me add a picture.  I am a longtime Pat McGrath and Armani fan. These remind me of a slightly more shiny Divinyl lip shine but more sheer. On the plus side, these are not so highly scented you can taste it like YSL and this formula is incredibly moisturizing. On the downside these are no where near as pigmented as pictured even after several coats. Mind you, I wanted a more sheer wash of color but I get more color from the Elf Fat Oils! 
Glad I got it but not worth the full price. I haven't purchased a drug store lip in sometime but there is nothing special here and just packaging wise, this does not feel luxurious. 

At the end of the day, this a very mid product. The only thing special is the name and that is just not enough for me.  Super rich, soft lip product. Sheet but buildable color. I wear it everyday.  i like it too much  It's really beautiful inside and out. Luxurious packaging and nourishing lipstick. It's my lips but better on my skin and great choice for summer. Will be buying more of these. They aren't long lasting though. Love Chanel beauty and fragrance  I'm amazed of how comfortable this formula is on my lips.  Feels very moisturizing.  The color is beautiful.  Lasts a decent amount of time, but not as long as a ""long wearing "" color of course.  Can't wait to try more colors and the other formulas!"
52,52,l'or√É¬©al,infallible matte resistance liquid lipstick,pimprod2039455,2610779,"  This particular tube seemed thinner than the past tubes I purchased.
The lipstick didn't last as long as usual. I don't usually need to reapply midday.  I love the color!! And the product!!  This lipstick is awesome, the blue red is such a perfect classic color. Some of the others really dont look like the swatches or descriptions online, but the color lasts so long and i bet you coyld mix and match with other liners  I really liked this lipstick. It did dehydrate my lips and made them look very dry and wrinkled. I applied some vaseline and then wiped off excess and reaplied. Lasted all day and night.  I've tried 2 colors (Le Rouge Paris and Major Crush) and both have high intensity color and are incredibly long lasting.  The applicator makes it easy to apply exactly where you need it to go with the right amount of product.  It dries pretty quickly.  These both have outlasted much higher priced cult favorites and I am genuinely impressed.  For its price it should at least be a semi decent product. But you get what you pay for. Cheap. Do not recommend at all.  Ive used L'Oreal infallible for years and it was the only brand I've used that actually does stay in forever. but then they changed their formula and it doesn't stay in anymore. such a disappointment"

Very nice color for my likes on my skin. A little heavier in volume making it tad harder to spread on checks etc with my own finger (which is my preferred way to apply).  Price will keep me from buying again.  A great way to add blush and lip color!  I even used as eyeshadow.  Love it!  I really love these. The colors are just gorgeous. Super easy to apply with my fingers. I just tap the color in place and definitely build from there if you desire. I have worn them by themselves or with a complimentary powder blush on top. I found quite a few Bobbi Brown products I like lately.  I have never used this type of blush before. I've always used a powder so it was a little bit of a learning curve but I am absolutely in love with it!  I'd been seeking something to help with a darker lip look but I didn't want the solid look that lipsticks provide and didn't want any greasy tinted lip balms. It's soft and buildable, didn't cake up on my dry skin I had, and lasted all night. Love it  Easy to apply and looks natural"

It's the perfect pink yet natural color that I use every day! However, product DOES transfer fairly easily even after setting spray.  I have this in both 601 and 123 it feels high end the colors are beautiful. It is a great value for the price point. I plan on buying more shades. I recommend these two shades as well they are great nudes!  A nice, creamy and longer lasting lipstick. I'm happy with my purchase.  Beautiful color  LOVED THIS PRODUCT  This color is stunning on brown skin!  I used to buy a matte made by ulta that they discounted and i think i FINALLY found the perfect match. Inhave shade 129 so perfect with everything and year round. It glides on so smooth and smells delicious!"
55,55,dior,rouge dior forever transfer-proof lipstick,pimprod2036864,2604466,"  I'm not one to touch up lipstick during the day. I've purchased everything supposed meant to hold up and most dont stay 2 hours. Purchased this on a whim. On at 830 am, had breakfast and lunch, still in place when I got home at 7 pm. Not drying. Now going to be my only purchased lip product.  Reminds me of the Clinique dark honey. Too bad it doesn't stay long.  It simply doesn't hold. It bleeds, even with liner, and easily rubs off with taking a few drinks from a cup. Very disappointed.  Barely transfers to other surfaces such as cups etc. and applies so smoothly to my lips.  I LOOOVVVVVEEEE this lipstick. It's not heavy, not flaky, not super dry, just a gorgeous matte lipstick. I just hate how expensive it is!  First, I'm not usually one to complain about smells. But the smell of this lipstick is just awful. It smells like old, expired perfume and it does not go away after applying. Packaging is LESS than drug store quality. honestly if I hadn't purchased this directly from Ulta I would have thought this was a temu knockoff. The shade I received was pretty but there was nothing,  and I mean NOTHING exceptional about this product. very disappointing  This stuff is horrible. It smudges, looks cakey, hard to apply and it look nice. Definitely not worth the price or hype."
56,56,mac,powder kiss velvet blur slim moisturizing matte lipstick,pimprod2035955,2601082,"  Versatile color that goes well with others. Lipstick texture is creamy & stays on longer than others I've tried.  The feel is soft, smooth, and hydrating. However, after an hour, the blur effect becomes more like a feather effect all the way around your mouth. Not pretty. Wears very poorly. Messy.  NO COMPLAINTS  I bought Peppery Pink. It is NOT pink, at all, on my very naturally pale lips. It's orangey. Which is a no-go for me. I only wear pink lip sticks. They better suit my skintone and personality. I am going to try one more from this line. The only pink-ish, fushia-ish color I see: Wild Sumac. I have quite a few bullet lipsticks of Powder Kiss, and a few others that are highly pigmented lipsticks by MAC. Hoping they come out with more pale pink colors, a blue pink, yellow pink, etc. I need more pink lipsticks in my life! {{smile}}  this formulation is by far the best when it comes to wearing matte with having some hydration! Pigmentation is great but the colors are a bit darker than their counterparts. To me that's not a big issue when it comes to pinks colors like Mull It Over which has better opacity on my lips compared to the original powder Kiss formula. Application is smooth with very minimal drag. When comparing Ruby Woo (retro) and Ruby New (PKV) the latter is a tad bit darker. As for duration, I wouldn't say this is a true 8 hour wear. The most fading I see is from the inside of the lips with a touch up needed to refresh the color after a few hours. I find that only lip stains are the best when it comes to withstanding fade from eating and drinking. Overall i love this line!  Very nice covage  Beautiful matte look and stays on for hours!"
57,57,lanc√É¬¥me,l'absolu rouge drama matte lipstick,pimprod2030263,2615631,  Like this product  I wore it for the first time yesterday and it was gorgeous. It took a few swipes for the color to show on my lips. I love all things skincare but I dabble in makeup. I wanted to get one of these since I saw them come out on Lancome's official instagram page and once I saw that they carry them at ulta I couldn't resist. 10/10 I recommend.
58,58,est√É¬©e lauder,pure color cr√É¬®me lipstick,pimprod2036943,2604692,"  Packaging is great as well as the color. I bought the rebellious rose, I love how its so moisturizing. However, it doesnt last very long. I have to keep reapplying throghout the day. For the price, I was expecting for it to last for an hour at least.  After years of searching I have finally found a lipstick with staying power that doesn't dry out my lips!
Bonus is the color is perfection for me
Thank you, thank you!  Creamy, but too expensive .  Luxurious and creamy; stays on throughout drinking and eating; has a pretty bold color/ makes a statement but not bold enough where I can't wear it to work every day.  It's a gorgeous orangey rose color and looks beautiful on.  I can see why it's the number 1 best selling color from Estee Lauder.  For reference I have fair to medium skin tone with neutral undertones.  Love the store in Dubuque Iowa.  Very helpful young women who know the products well.  Very helpful.  The lipstick goes on smoothly and has a silky consistency. I like that the color is vibrant and slightly stains the lips as the day goes.  Purchased the color 441 - Tea Rose in the Creme formula.  Ulta didn't carry the color I wanted so this was somewhat close. It's a nice neutral, just a little pinker than I wanted.  I think the formula keeps changing and it's a little more greasy/waxy on the lips so staying  power is limited without a pencil.  Purchased a Morphe Soulmate lip liner to go with it that I'm very happy with.  I'm glad I got this on Ulta's 40% off sale.  I would not re-purchase at full price."
59,59,pat mcgrath labs,satinallure lipstick,pimprod2040428,2613774,"  Lately I've been loving visiting my local ulta to swatch products. Bought Negligee on a whim after testing the color on my wrist. Absolutely stunning color! Formula is smooth and a true satin finish. Pairs nicely with a few of my ND palettes. I've worn this lipstick every day since purchasing!  Besides the price, these are the perfect lipstick. I have two shades and both are smooth, lightweight, and extremely comfortable. They dont gather or clump up on the inner lip. Hoping for a sale to buy more!  doesn't last  The color is beautiful, I loved how smooth it feels. It's not a matte color but looks great.  This reminds me a lot of MAC satin lipsticks. I love every one I've gotten by Pat Mcgrath and I probably own about 8 now. Very surprised to see any negative reviews.  Creamy and pigmented formula. It doesn't cling to dry spots or lines. After application I place a tissue over my lips and press a translucent powder on top. Sets the lipstick for the day and it doesn't budge. The first more lux brand of lipstick I see myself repurchasing.  I'm honestly shocked at the poor reviews. Its a great lipstick with an amazing formula. It goes on smooth as butter. Is it expensive? Yes. However the quality is there!"

61,61,e.l.f. cosmetics,sheer slick lipstick,pimprod2040787,2614891,"  I discovered this product a while online and loved it ever since! It stains the lips beautifully and last a while!  Holy moly. This is my favorite lip product I own. Its ALWAYS out of stock, so I get nervous using it! 

Going to buy a few once it returns!! 

Its gorgeous, black honey but better.  This is one of the best products elf carries. Please bring back the other shades!!  I am absolutelt OBSESSED with this lip product! I am a medium-tan skin tone and the color looks amazing without being too red. I wear it every single day and always get so many compliments. It feels like a chapstick and keeps my lips moisturized all day and adds a beautiful sheen to them. I always stock up on this product because it is a staple for me.  Excellent dupe for clinique. I bought 10. 4/10 were broken. Will be exchanging the broken ones.  such good dupe  the shade is beautiful and works on so many diff skin tones. reminds me of black honey by Clinique. more balmy than glossy, which is good to keep in mind."
62,62,dior,rouge dior forever liquid lipstick,pimprod2036844,2605054,"  Purchased the color Forever Glam today and tried it out. Overall like, but not the color I thought it would be. Doe foot applicator is great, it is longwear, nontransfer once it completely dries, but lips felt a little dry after removing and I only wore it for a few hours. The swatch on the Ulta website looks red and super matte; in the bottle, which is frosted, looks like a matte brickish red; in actuality it's a fuchsia, pink red, and while matte, wasn't super matte.  I got the 820 forever unique and it's more brown than that rosy lip color ( i guess). maybe I'm wrong but it doesn't look like the color in the picture. I have yet to try it. I was really looking forward to trying it on. Now noticing in the write your review it shows the color I got. idk it's strange üòï. this product has so many good reviews.  I got the shade 999 because I love a red lip. this formula stays all day and Is the perfect neutral red. the applicator is wonderful because you can be precise with the tip.  I had high hopes for this and purchased the #100. It more pink than beige and very sheer without much pigment or coverage. It does last but its not what I hoped for in a prestige brand.  I bought the shade 999 which is the iconic red. Every time I wear it, I feel like the whimsy, mysterious, beautiful, cig-smoking French (I'm asian) love interest of some confused young art history student  in an indie romantic french arthouse film. or better yet, I feel like the French (again, I'm asian) woman in her 30s living her best single life eating brie and crackers and sipping wine, wearing black and white stripes paired with light blue jeans, hooking up with everyone and everything, and also spends her weekends biking near the Siene River or the Provence lavender countryside. the shade just makes everything about me look.....better. Honestly, what I'm trying to say is every girl deserves a red lipstick that makes her look beautiful, and the Dior 999 is one of those red lipsticks.  Absolutely love!!  These really do stay on. Ths formula is very lightweight and pigmented. I have a few shades, 100 is a pretty nude I use almost every day. 720 and 999 are gorgeous reds. They arent drying like many long wearing lipsticks are. Highly recommend!!"
63,63,morphe,soulmatte velvet lip mousse,pimprod2038219,2608338,"  Love the color and feel of this product  Nice color, last  all day  It's a really nice color, nice application but dried up way too fast and it made my lips feel dry and cakey.  Beautiful color.  This lip duo set is seriously amazing! It's definitely the best I've ever used. The only thing I wish is that it came in more shades of pink!  Amazing color that lasts for hours. Beautiful finish, not too drying for a matte lipstick  I am soooo glad I tried this!! I originally heard about this from an influencer, so I got it in the shade wifey and wow my jaw is on the floor. It's so good. It literally wears stunningly on the lips. I usually don't write reviews but for this, I had to take the time because it's just that good. I just spent $80 on SKKN beauty, Matt lipsticks, and those were absolute trash. Morphy blew SKKN by kim's lipsticks out of the water. I'm so glad I found this. I will definitely be stocking up in purchasing more colors!!!"
64,64,about-face,cherry pick lip color butter,pimprod2037252,2605929,"  OBSESSED with the  grunge vampy lip look, and this shade is perfect for this. it's super glossy and pretty, but be ready to reapply a few times. it's beautiful on and i want more colors!  The color was great and so was the shine. I had to take it off immediately unfortunately because the smell is awful and SO. STRONG!!  I tried the berry smash shade. I expected it to be somewhat pigmented, which its not. Its super sheer and cannot be built up at all. I returned it. Smell is good and texture is non-sticky.  Im giving this 4 stars because I truly like the pigment, formula, and hydrating/nourishing feel of this lip product, however, the smell/taste of these is a bit offputting. I will continue to wear the Pampelmousse shade I bought, because it truly is a ""your lips but better"" shade, but i dislike the scent and taste of this. Its fruity, but in a sickening way. I will probably not be purchasing more shades, because the smell lasts a little bit and I dont like risking getting a headache from my lip product. Overall if you are not bothered by scent, these are a 10/10. They are thinner than the Tarte Maracuja lip products, which I enjoy. It does have a cushiony feel, not too sticky, but because it has some grip on the lip, it lasted quite a while (without eating or drinking). I would say you will have to reapply farely often, but as long as scents dont bother you, I would recommend!  Pamplemousse is the most beautful natural shade for my yellow leaning light skinned girlies. Tarte maracuja who? Nyx slick click who?! These are it. The end all, be all. I will be buried in the product.  I can't speak to any other colors, but the shade pamplemousse is a beautiful rosy pink that is close to my natural lip color. I love that it's so glossy/juicy yet super pigmented, especially for a balm. That said, it doesn't leave behind any kind of stain and is not particularly long lasting. That isn't a claim of the product, so I'm not mad about it, but I can't help but wonder how gracefully some of the more intense colors would wear off after eating or drinking. There is a strong fruity fragrance which I enjoy but others might not. The texture is‚Ä¶a little sticky, but not bad considering that it's both glossy AND full-coverage. I haven't tried other products of this type but from what I've seen that's to be expected. I'm not particularly adventurous with colors and a lot of them look quite warm-toned (I have a very cool complexion), but I would totally try kiwi fizz if it ever came back in stock! Peach punisher and the cranberries have my eye too!  I've always loved lipstick, but my lips dry easily and almost everything else I've tried has only exacerbated that. However, this product feels incredibly comfortable on my lips! I also love how buildable the color is."

66,66,juvia's place,liquid lipstick,pimprod2043831,2620821,"  So I bought this shade when it first came out and was in the long tube, it's the absolute perfect shade of red! Not to dark but just dark enough, I love the shade enough to buy it again. But the new packaging is terrible, the thick wand is hard to work with and then you have to be really careful about applying because if you put it on too thick then it gets too dry and starts to flake off. I liked the old packaging better with a smaller wand so I can be more precise and the formula just needs to be adjusted enough where it's not so dry. If you're not experienced with liquid lipsticks or makeup I definitely wouldn't recommend the formula.  juvias place needs a different distributer for their liquid products because the formulas are amazing but the packaging is not it  I love this color, it's absolutely gorgeous. I've gotten so many compliments from it. however I wish the formula was different, I really like the NYX liquid lipstick formula and I was hoping it would be something like that, long lasting And transfer proof but instead when I put it on it becomes cakey and it doesn't last. when you move your lips around it crumbles. I had such high hopes for this as I love Juvia's other products. And lastly I wish It had a different applicator, the whatever kind it's called is just not my favorite, It just doesn't help with an already cakey formula.  I love these liquid lipstick. The color is long lasting. You will have to prep your lips with lip oil/balm before using it. The pigments are very unique on my skin tone. I want them all.  This formula is your 2016-style, super flat matte, full coverage cream formula. Think Colourpop Ultra Matte lipstick BEFORE the reformulation. It's NOT whipped, moussy or watery; it's a thick smooth cream. It gives a budge proof dry down that doesn't move while eating or drinking. You need to put on a primer first or it will flake and crack. I use plain Vaseline and it works beautifully. I really love the finish, and the color  Lulu is a GORGEOUS deep cherry! The applicator is the same chunky one as the glosses, so it's difficult to achieve a sharp, precise lip line without adding liner after.  I tried this lipstick and it was very drying and paychy for me. I will try again since i got 4 different shades ‚Ä¶ i think if your lips are prepped properly it may work but for now, im giving it a thumbs down  I have had this lipstick on for hours and it hasn't budged through eating, drinking and exercise."
67,67,rabanne,dramalips glassy lipstick,pimprod2045103,2623339,"  I bought the drama lips in the shade go bankrupt. I love the shade but there's not as much shine as it claims to have. With that being said this does have fantastic wear time and fades nicely. I do recommend using a lip liner and maybe a lip primer.  I have no tie or bias to this brand, I've actually never heard of it before‚Ä¶ But I am a lip product junkie so I decided to try this product and I absolutely love it. The shade first date is such a beautiful, every day color, especially for my fellow brown girls ü§é - besides the shade I also really enjoy the formula, it applies smoothly and can be built up for a more opaque look. The staying power is great; now this is not transfer proof, but if you don't touch your lips, it lasts for a resonable amount of time, it stayed on  through a sweaty workout.  Super happy with this purchase. It glides on, doesn't dry out my lips, and the color is spot on. My only problem? I got it two days ago and can't find it anymore. üòÇü´† Time to purchase another, I guess!  The color payoff is beautiful, and so far has been hydrating on my lips. Reference I do have dry lips."
68,68,nars,powermatte long-lasting lipstick,pimprod2035245,2599873,"  I am not impressed by the color or the long lasting.  It does not last and I will return this product.  Bought this in shade thunder kiss and was super excited for it. I love the liquid lips so I had high hopes for this, but it went on horribly. I tried adding a gloss and it still looked rough. Idk about longlasting since it took it off immediatly but it didnt seem like it was going to stay on lol.  Comfortable, great color, all of the things. But not particularly long lasting. I would recommend as a great lipstick but wouldn't use its lasting time as a selling point.  I bought this in American woman and I keep going back and forth on whether to return it because its completely average. I decided to splurge because the color was right and I figured it must be amazing by the ratings but its barely ok. It is off my lips in an hour, its chalky so you must use lip gloss and its so expensive you get angry when you look in the mirror and only my lipliner is still on.  I had high hopes for this as it's NARS, but yuck.  This is no better than drugstore makeup.  Shade is muddy, doesn't last, smears, and is too warm for my cool skin.  i LOVE this lipstick, and despite being a verified cheap-o, i've bought two shades and plan for at least one more. i work in childcare, so while i love a bold lip, i needed something that would a) require minimal upkeep and prep, b) last at least 5 hours (i often don't get a second to reapply until then!) and c) wouldn't transfer, because smooching little ones is the best part of the job. i've tried maybelline, rimmel, nyx, wet n wild, urban decay, mac‚Ä¶ nothing fit the bill. if the color was right, it got everywhere; if it didn't transfer, it also didn't last more than 2 hours. so i tried this on a whim and found it not only stayed with extremely minimal fading for 6+ hours, but barely left even a hint of color on the travel mug i drink from all day. i use my powermatte lipsticks nearly every single day now and almost never have to reapply.

however there are some caveats!
- while drinking has almost no effect but a very light fading in the center of my lips, eating can, especially if it's an oily meal or something where you're pressing your mouth to the food a lot, like a burger. so i do reapply after eating. 
- like all mattes, it can be a little drying, but some nice lip balm at bedtime handles that.
- it can dry down a little darker than expected, particularly if you use lipliner underneath. i never bother with lipliner, just apply directly, and i've found the color stays best that way.

so far i've tried the shades dragon girl and tease me. dragon girl is a beautiful true blue-red, and great for those days where you want to look a little put together but don't want to do much: just slap it on and you instantly look done up. tease me is a dusty rose color, great for everyday, and goes with almost anything. the colors are very close to the website, maybe a tiny bit darker in real life. definitely, definitely recommended if you want something long lasting that doesn't get everywhere!  It's a winner. Stays on remain the color it says it is! Pretty smooth application and make your lupd are not chapped when you apply!"
69,69,e.l.f. cosmetics,o face satin lipstick,pimprod2036832,2604832,"  long lasting, moisturizing formula, nice color.  I have heard great things about these inexpensive lipsticks so when the went on sale I decided to try one. Utilizing ULTA's virtual ""try on"" feature I found  ""hustle"" and thought it was a perfect nude. Imagine my surprise when it arrived and was a straight up mustard yellow. I want to pick up another because the consistency was great. It was a comfortable matte lipstick and in such an elegant package.  My review is for the color Shameless! I have a hard time finding lipsticks online because my skin undertones are weird and I only look good in blue/cool based colors (I look horrid in warm/orange-based lipsticks). This is my first time trying the elf lipsticks, and after being very careful with my selection, I think I found the perfect color for me!! It's smooth, it has good coverage, and it doesn't seem to irrtate my sensitive lip skin (Im prone to cheilitis). This color perfectly suits my cool-ish (olive-ish? Idek) skin tone! I also ordered my first ever lip liner from NYX in the color ""no wine-ing"" and I think it's a perfect combo! I wore it all day today and I have to admit that it doesn't last a super long time by itself, it definitely would need to be reapplied throughout the day, especially after eating. But for the affordable price, that's not an issue for me!  A cheap imitation with too little pigment and packaging that's not nearly as nice as some people think. Most elf ""dupes"" are trash, and this is another. Their $3 satin lipsticks are virtually the same, just buy one of those instead of getting ripped off.  I bought this in shameless a couple months ago it's great. Amazing pigment and it stays on for a long time. After about 3-5 minutes it doesn't transfer as well. It's also NOT drying.‚ù§Ô∏è  this product is so good and i didn't expect it to be this good. really creamy and easy to use  Absolutely loving this lipstick! Super smooth application and beautiful color! I did indeed bought another color a day afterüòÇüòç"

The color 'Peony' with a brown lip liner looks stunning. The formula is great as well, glides smoothly , the finish is velvet matt.  Nice color though for some reason it looked different in store and at home. I made sure to get a fully packaged lipstick but when I opened it at home the tip had been smushed.  Not impressed.  I loved the texture of the lipstick and how it doesn't dry out your lips. It gives a pretty good amount of product and I truly believe it is better then high-end makeup  This lipstick is a new fav! The formula goes on smoothly, the color is gorgeous and the quality is top notch. Will be returning to purchase other shades!  My holy grail fav lipstick is the charlotte tilbury pillowtalk lipstick and this is an amazing and affordable alternative! The color is super similar and goes on smooth. 10/10, a drugstore fav."

73,73,revlon,colorstay overtime lipcolor,fs797198,2093944,"  excellent color  Color is not a true mauve.  As long as I have a coupon for money off I will buy this product.  If I don't have a coupon I will buy it at a certain store cause it is cheaper.  I used to use the Colorstay lipcolor, but since i've retired, i don't go out & about much & all my lip colors are dried out. I was so happy to find these again here. Love the first 2 colors that i've gotten & will be back for more!  This product was terrible!  Been using this 4+ years, through crazy long outdoor bar shifts etc. Swear by it. This is how I make sure it stays: 1. Put it on clean/ dry lips - after washing face. No lip balm first, nothing. 2. Apply an even coat. I treat it like paint and spread with a finger if i have to. 3. LET IT DRY 2 minutes+‚Ä¶ dont rub lips together or anything. 4. Apply another coat if you have to/ even out edges, whatever. (repeat #3). 5. Apply gloss, even if its just a tiny bit - the color product isnt meant to be worn without it, it will be kinda sticky otherwise. This will stay on overnight even. Only thing that gets it off is oil based makeup remover and I wouldn't have it any other way. Oh and it can come off the inner part of your lips a little if you eat a bunch of chicken wings :)  I have tried many long wear lip color formulas, but this is the best. Great shades, easy to apply the color that lasts all day, and I can refresh the gloss anywhere anytime without a mirror."
74,74,kylie cosmetics,matte liquid lipstick,pimprod2026498,2584016,"  This is the worst liquid lipstick I have used in a long time. 
The applicator? Don't even try to get an even line around the edge of your mouth. 
The formula? Never in my life have my lips been so puckered dry. It looks like my great great great grandmother's lips they were so pruny. 
I would not recommend this to my worst enemy. It made me physically angry after i applied this product. It should have stayed in 2016 where it belonged.  I was ride or die for these. But for a while the colors aren't consistent and the samples are not the same as when you buy them. Sometimes Bare is the perfect color and sometimes it will be super peach/orange. The new formula also no longer has the staying power and is super drying. I'm so sad I used to love these.  Gross i hate the feeling and the color sample and the color online are not the same  Stays on all day no matter what I eat or drink!!  I'm surprised to read all the negative reviews. I love these, the new formula is so much better than the original. The original was very drying and would make my lips look all cracked. This formula is smooth and lasts longer, but if you eat something greasy you'll have to  reapply. Maybe these other people got a bad one. It does happen, one time I got an empty brow gel from another brand. That was weird!  Absolutely love Kylie's matte liquid collection. I own a decent amount of the pink shades they all look great. I have medium skin tone and in the summer I tan easily. The formula helps keep lips moisturized  I got the shade ""a moment"" and it is one my favorites to wear as it goes with every look. I do more simple makeup, usually just lashes, lips and brows are the go to and this lip will do it all for you!"
75,75,colourpop,lippie stix,pimprod2009395,2550432,"  I am in love with the shade ""goal digger"" looks amazing!!!  This is a great lipstick/balm for anyone that likes a more matte look! I bought this to match the liner, and i do feel the colors are a bit different. I bought ""Oh Snap"" and feel the color was a bit more cool-toned than i thought it would be. Despite it not being my favorite, i do think its a great lip product for those who like a matte lip. It sits well on the lips.  I love the texture and definitely buy it again, people ask me what brand is it because they love how it looks on me.  I love color pop. The colors are beautiful and they don't make your lips look dry. I always get compliments on my shades of lip colors that I wear and the lip liners go well with the lip colors . I am excited to try other color pop products and I hope I am just as pleased.  I love this lipstick!  It's the perfect color.  It's a bit dry, but it is so worth it. I don't have problems with it smudging.  I like the color selection, too.  Thankful I finally have a color that's not too light and not too dark.  It's just right!  Beautiful and at a great price!  Last most of the day but most importantly did not dry my lips like other all day wear. Will be trying other colors that go with my olive completion.  These are my favorite lipsticks on the market. The staying power and creaminess in this formula is unmatched especially for the price. Oh snap and parker are my go to shades."
76,76,nyx professional makeup,lip lingerie xxl long-lasting matte liquid lipstick,pimprod2024490,2595046,"  No, not really.  You didn't have the one I wanted. This was the closes matt color to what I wanted. I had never purchased this brand before.  It's very thick and it flakes.  A little brighter than expected but last about 4 to 5 hours. Less expensive than what I have been using.  Good product and last long.  Goes on smooth with a matte look.  The reason for 4-star rating is because they changed the color that I normally wear.... now way too dark.  Oh.My.Gosh! The fricking pigment is crazy! This lasts all day and is kinda hard to get off not going to lie! Although this lipstick is long lasting, it does take a bit to dry if you use a substantial amount! I really like this product because you can make your lips very dark, if you use alot, or make them light, if you use a little.  Untamable is a beautiful, true red. It glides on nicely, dries down quickly, doesn't transfer, and even lasts through a meal. The only downside is that it is a little dry but that is a small price for the color payoff and longwear. And the üçí on top is the price. This lipstick is an incredible value.  this is one of my favorite cheap matte long lasting lippie I use to buy stila but it's kind of expensive and this is a cheaper version of something I like  idk what is the hype but after about a month, formula starts to dry. When on lips, it peels very bad. I tried multiple colors, including the black one. save money and go for another product."
77,77,kiko milano,unlimited double touch,pimprod2032259,2595757,"  Took a chance on this product because I thought the packaging was cute but turned out to be the best gamble. The color lasts super long and the clear top coat helps prevent drying. Advice for best use: Let the color dry before putting on the clear coat :)  I love this lipstick. The color stays put in the gloss that you put over. It is very hydrating, and I often will use just the gloss by itself, too.  Beautiful color, lasts without being drying.  I honestly don't understand all the bad reviews. This lipstick literally stays on my lips the whole day and it doesnt get cackey (it only gets cackey if you apply multiple layers or a very thick layer). You just have to apply a very thin layer and give it enough time to dry before adding the gloss and it doesn't budge unless i peel off my lips or if i take it off with a makeup remover. The only con would be that the amount of lipstick is small so i have to rebuy it frequently cause i finish it in a few weeks if i use it everyday. Still would definitely recommend it, my favorite colors for everyday wear are 131, 120, and 103  It doesn't last after eating or drinking and it gets cakey after applying,I find Kylie and Huda beauty are much better options for lasting and hydrating!  For long wearing lip colors like this, the key is to let it dry before applying the gloss. I personally think this exacerbates your lip line so definitely don't forget to exfoliate and moisturize 
Highly recommend if you want a low maintenance lip  The color is pretty, but I feel like just using a nicely pigmented lip gloss would accomplish the same thing. I was under the impression that it would be a longer wear glossy lipstick, but the lipstick itself is already pretty glossy so it just makes it kind of a mess."

 me. This one is perfect because what you see is what you get.  Juvia's lipsticks are AMAZING!!! They go on smooth, the texture feels like you have nothing on your lips, the pigments rich and true to color. I have 4 Juvia's lipsticks already and can't wait to buy more!!  This is fairly comfortable on, but its just a little too matte for what I like currently. I wanted to love this, but I rarely reach for it. If I do wear it, I usually pair it with the Juvias Place Lip Oil and it makes it much more hydrating, but even more malleable  I loooooove. New fav lipstick. Got shade Libra and I'm so glad I did!  I have worn this color for several years. It is creamy and doesn't dry my lips.  Love the brown tones and the texture is light, smooth  My favorite part about this is the packaging, such a beautiful, soft texture.

Creamy.  Not worth almost $50.  There are so many others to choose from.  Won't buy again  Glides smoothly  I was really hoping to like this for the cost and I usually love dior makeup products, but this one is just okay. The formula is nice and it has good pigment, but the color isnt as pictured/described. I probably wouldn't buy this again.  I got this as a gift and I love it. It's very mousturizing, stains the lips beautifully and the case is so cute.l definitely will be purchasing more shades.  I have several dior lipsticks, and have had several others over the years searching for my perfect nude. I do not have a lot of pigment in my lips and am pretty fair skinned so everything shows up on me, and fairly true to color. The shade 418 Beige Oblique is my most perfect nude!!! I am 42 years old and it hides the vertical lines in my lips so well while being smooth, glossy and almost moisturizing. Although the tone is cool/neutral, it can go so well with even warm tone eyeshadow looks because the lipstick is about my perfect match of color to the inside of my lips. This is really a, ""my lips but WAY better"" type of lipstick for me. I am so worried that this shade will be discontinued because that is what happens with literally everything that works for me. I can't believe after 30 years if wearing makeup, I have finally found my perfect lipstick. Love Dior!  Does not last 6 hours like I was told - more like 60 minutes"

It was not long lasting as described, it was off in less than an hour, no drinking or eating and the color was blah.  For the cost I was expecting a little more.  This color is so beautiful! Such a flattering color, it is on the thicker side but i love it"
83,83,iconic london,cloud kiss matte lip mousse,pimprod2045570,2623746,"  My first lip mousse and I am loving it. Glides on smooth and looks beautiful. I plan to buy more!  This matte mousse is not only pretty but also light on your lips. You can wear it without worrying about imperfections, specifically for someone like me with thin lips üôÉ you control how much you apply on your lips and be worry free it won't fade.  I recently tried the ColourPop Cloud Kiss Matte Lip Mousse, and I'm in love! The formula is incredibly lightweight and feels so comfortable on my lips. It applies smoothly and dries down to a beautiful matte finish without feeling drying. The color payoff is fantastic and lasts for hours without needing touch-ups. Plus, the range of shades is gorgeous. This has quickly become my go-to lip product for both everyday wear and special occasions!  Love the color. Feels great on the lips and it's long lasting.  The color looks really nice, smooth application and great moist feeling  Amazing texture and coverage, long lasting!  Very smooth application, cute color"
84,84,nabla,beyond blurry lipstick,pimprod2045424,2625756,  I was ready to buy these once I saw the color selection. I know they're all nude-based but they all have nice differences. I got divinise and it's the perfect nude shade. The formula is SO comfortable - so many balms have silicones but aren't that comfortable but these are great. They don't just dry down at all and they are long lasting. Can't wait to buy more shades!  If you like the anastasia lip velvets but would line more control then you will like these. They are similar in that they have a more silicone texture and are not drying with a matte finish. I personally like the color selection and ease of use of these better. I chose the color aphrodite and its a beautiful wearable red.
85,85,maybelline,color sensational ultimatte slim lipstick,pimprod2020630,2590023,"  these are fun to pop in your bag for everyday wear, also they smell great!  Good  Giving it 1 star as the product goes on smooth and creamy, and lasts pretty long; docking off the rest as it is incredibly drying over time. I was about halfway through the lipstick (from everyday use) when I started noticing signs of dehydrated lips (swelling and cracking at the edges, discoloration). It's a pity because I wanted to pan it all the way through, but it's just not worth it.  Love product  This lipstick is quite creamy for a matte which is nice. It tooks a few layers to get the full color, not a one swipe lipstick. It lasted a long time and never dried!  Just found my new favorite lipstick  I have always been a fan of coral/orange shade lipsticks. I love how the shade More Auburn looks like a natural color when applied while giving a defined look to the face."

I would love go get a red color next but they are sold out.  Love this  This formula is not the same as their previous matte formula. This one is sticky and doesn't have that nice whipped texture like the other one. I will be returning this.  LOVE this color but only lasted about half the day. Would still recommend! The formula is smooth and moisturizing.  Although I like a matte finish, this product is very drying.  I only applied it once and it lasted all day.  I was excited to see this product in Ulta. It does not dry out my lips and stays on a long time. Influential is a great neutral and looks good with my light pink blush and fair to medium skin."
91,91,charlotte tilbury,matte revolution lipstick,pimprod2043355,2619368,"  amazing!!  This lipstick is long lasting but it is a matt lipstick so it is a little drying (at least for me). I have to make sure to use a lip sleeping mask to make sure my lips are conditioned really good. I love lipstick and have stuff ranging from dollar store, drug store and lux. My advice is if you have never tried a lux lipstick and are curious, you can probably skip this one. I have lipstick from the dollar store that I reach for over this one.  I'm  disappointed in this one! I have  2 other lipsticks in this line. They are more moisturizer.  I ended up  tossing it out. Maybe it's  the manufacturers fault!  This is my second favorite color of her line. It definitely feels like moisture on my lips. I would buy it again!  I would buy this one again!  I love the shade, however I wish this was more hydrating! It feels dry and flakey soon after applied and doesn't last.  Literally my new fav lipstick"
92,92,l'oreal,colour riche original satin lipstick,2681,2617006,"  I like all colors available. Nice lipstick.  Always searching for something 'better,' I tried Loreal Color Riche Original on a whim, after using top name brands for years. To my surprise, this product stayed on and looking fresh after a whole cup of coffee and breakfast! I absolutely love the color too. My lips feel smooth and silky and the color does not bleed.  Love this lipstick. So happy it was still available and that I could find it at Ulta !  I love the lipstick, it's rich and goes on smooth. The color lasts and it has a nice shine.  I've worked in cosmetics for a long time, I love this lipstick. Lasts a long time and doesn't bleed throughout the day.  This formula is absolutely divine. So creamy and lasts a long time too.  Honestly, I really like this lipstick! I find it very smooth, and I love the color, it looks really good and feels really nice on the lips"

I love everything about this lipstick. The formula lasts all day and isn't drying. It never even smudges. The color Scholar Sista is the perfect everyday shade. And on top of all those things that make it an ideal lipstick, it's more sustainable with the refillable packaging. I absolutely love it.  I love that Ri is putting her money where her mouth is and promoting environmentalism in her makeup products. Love the reusable tubes. They're way affordable compared to the alternatives. And the lipstick's bomb! Keeping me moisturized in the desert. Got Danger Dancer and Mutha Luva < 3  I didn't realize when I bought this online that it was a refill, but I don't mind. It's a really flattering color and the texture is very creamy and doesn't make my lips feel dry or sticky.  This was my first Fenty Beauty purchase ever, and I am obsessed!!  I'm obsessed with Freak-went-Fly'r. It's a deep sexy red that I always get complimented on when I go out. It doesnt dry out my lips or sit on my lips just to disappear after a drink"
94,94,fenty beauty by rihanna,slip shine sheer shiny lipstick,pimprod2031479,2592338,"  This lipstick is gorgeous and I will definitely repurchase once I finish this one. It works so well with my skin tone light/medium neutral and I love the formula  this is more suddle than I usually wear but I am obsessed üòç  it is absolutely stunning and the sparkles are a nice touch. the formula is absolutely amazing and makes my lips feel smooth and hydrated.  TOO creamy and thick. Not comfortable on the lips at all and it's so creamy and thick when you put it on the product smooshes everywhere  Beautiful shade on anybody!!  My new go to! It's looks like my lips but better. The smell is faint but so nice, like cocoa. It's also the first lipstick that hasn't dried my lips out, it actually keeps them moisturized.  Goes on easily and the color lasts even when the gloss wears off a little.  I bought Bubblerum and loved it so much that I had to pick up Cookies & Cocoa.  The formula is soft, creamy, and moisturizing.  I am very light-skinned and the colors look amazing on me.  I have another on my wishlist!"

Very mosturizing and pigminted. I'm between fair and medium with yellow underdtones. Both colors are beautiful and very complimenting on the skin. The darker one is my favorite! It's subtle and not overpowering.  Great lipstick. Hydrating and high pigmented. I love how slim it is, easy to carry in small bags.  This product feels cheap. It is very hydrating but I've found that my loreal lipstick is way better and the price is better! Why is this so expensive? I can't justify this purchase and will stick with my tried and true loreal from now on...  This is actually surprsingly hydrating for a Charlotte Tilbury lip product ‚Äî I find that the lipsticks can be quite drying for really dry lips. The color is beautiful, its the classic Pillowtalk color but with a sheer, glossy finish. The price, however, hurts a littleü•≤Sa"
97,97,about-face,paint-it matte lip color,pimprod2033366,2613959,"  super cute shade! wasnt over drying. love it  I have the shade Canyon, which is not a coral, but a very pure orange. For someone who really loves orange (like me), this is excellent. For someone who likes coral, this is misleading. The lipstick is a good, ordinary matte lipstick that dries down opaque and doesn't rub off easy. That being said, I cannot say that this lipstick is great, as the formula tends to flake very slightly throughout the day, and is best used with a lip liner. The packaging itself also tends to pull too much product up with the applicator, and I end up having to wipe off excess on the entrance of the tube before applying. I don't think this is a bad product, but I also don't think a reformulation is a bad idea.  I really like these! They are comfortable (for a matte formula), they are long lasting, and the colors are great! They are a little drying, but what do you expect for a matte formula? Overall when I want my lipstick to last all day, I often reach for these  This lip color is beautiful and super pigmented. However, it rolled off my counter and shattered, leaving bright red pigment all over the floor, wall, and carpet that certainly has staying power to my disappointment. Buyer beware - you will need to handle with EXTREME care. If it had been easier to clean, I would happily have given this product 4 or 5 stars.  I got Monarchy, it isnt the best color for me personally but i love the formula. It dries down matte kind of slow and requires setting powder to prevent transferring. I currently use it as blush since it doesn't fit my everyday vibe as a lip color.  I'm a red lip girlie. I bought the shade Serrated Bite on a whim cause it was on sale. I love love love it!! The formula is amazing, it smells lovely, and is nearly transfer proof. I work for ten hours a day, and it will last all day. My go-to lipstick is usually REM's cream lipstick, but this is a very close second!!  So sad, I wanted to love this lipstick so much. The color was beautiful, but it went on patchy. Since it was patchy, I had to apply more to even it out. Because there was so much on my lips, it would get extremely flaky the second it would dry. So flaky that I would find little red specks on my teeth from it flaking off my lips. On to the next I suppose. (I will say though, that it stained my lips after I took it off and that actually looked kinda nice)"
98,98,colourpop,ultra matte lip,pimprod2039945,2612970,"  strange feeling on the lips. it feels real thick and is drying.  I am a lip gloss fanatic & when i ran into this lip gloss in particular It Girl, she gave the same energy as Fenty glow does as far as color & smell ‚ú®ü§ç  This is such an affordable lip gloss! I recieved it for my birthday in shade ""It Girl"" and its one of my top picks. The finish it gives is light and some-what buttery. Its very smooth and non-sticky. The lip gloss container also doesn't leak at all!  Really wanted to love this because the shade 'canon dr'  is exactly what i was looking for but the color payoff is extremely patchy and applies unevenly unless you add a gloss or something on top of it and that kinda defeats the purpose of a matte lip imo.  I absolutely love this product! The staying power of a liquid lipstick without all the heavy dryness. Zuma is such a gorgeous color and i have purchased it twice.  I lke the glossiness and color pay off i wish it would last longer  The color is great, the pigment is great, it stays on but how to apply? I tried using just my fingers and it was splotchy. Tried a kabuki brush and it didn't pick up any of the product. Tried a sponge and it settled into my poors/skin. So, I'm still trying to find the best way to apply it!"
99,99,bobbi brown,crushed lip color moisturizing lipstick,pimprod2024879,2583567,"  I love this lipstick I got it in color blush and its perfect to put on and go. Its smooth very sheer color. Will purchase again. Very smooth on lips not sticky at all. Love it  Genuinely, I had given up on lipstick completely. I found this brand's tinted lip balm, and fell in love so hard that I looked for what else was in store in lips, and when I saw the colors this brand had to offer? I HAD to try it. And to my UTMOST pleasure, the lipstick was absolutely wonderful. Everything other lipsticks wish they could be. The natural colors are to be adored, and the lipstick does not feel as cakey and thick as others have for me in the past. Also, the Ruby is the very first red that I've liked on myself, ever. The only bad thing I have to say is, I am sad I don't own all of them!  I am low key neutral kind of gal and this is beautiful to wear with a gloss on top.. got it in Italian Rose and it's beautiful on‚Ä¶ stays with a gloss I am not a touch up gal so it stays for my day‚Ä¶  Does not cover lips well.  Excellent product  I hate to say this but I just purchased this lipstick and it tastes so bad, almost like beef tallow. The scent is terrible. I'm not sure how people buy this. Also I got a new one thinking it went rancid and nope just nasty.  This lipstick has a really buildable, sheer, color. I really like the natural finish. The only con is that it can be slightly drying, I just moisturize well overnight."
100,100,nabla,beyond jelly lipstick,pimprod2042264,2616730,"  I've been wanting these lipsticks since they dropped ~18 months ago, as hydrating, sheer lippies are my holy grail. Finally received them this week! They are much heavier in texture and pigmented in color than I anticipated but wow, they look gorgeous. I bought Ardor and Libido, and they are true to their color name. They do not go on sheer but after a few lipsmacks, you can bring down the intensity. Long-wearing but definitely need to re-apply after eating/drinking, and thankfully not like other glossy lip products, it doesnt build up or create that sticky effect. Big fan. Think I'm gonna splurge on Dea and Noctura next.  If you're looking for a high-end tinted lip balm, this is it. The formula is very soft and the tint is there but sheer. It's definitely not a lipstick. Weighing in at .11 oz, it has nearly triple the product of the Hourglass equivalent product while having a similar formula.  Gorgeous color, but smelled very strongly of coconut (a nauseating overwhelming smell that I could smell from a few feet away).  The formula itself is waxy like a crayon and the color has no staying power.  Sift, beautiful color! Easy aoplication. Feels lovely on the lips! So happy with this purchase! This is totally a dupe for the BCH!  I hardly write reviews, but this was worth my time and energy to spread the word. If you want a really soft, natural ""no-makeup makeup"" type of lippie, try this. It makes the lips look and feel so hydrated, and the color can be built up. Paired with a lip liner it's a knockout. It wears away beautifully and is addicting to apply. 10/10 Please make more unique cool toned colors!!  I got the shade ""libido"" and it looks so beautiful on the lips. It's lighweight on the lips and has a sheer but pretty coverage with some shine would definitely recommend!!  the red sapphire is hands down the easiest, best red lipstick i've ever used! smooth, moisturizing, comfortable and long lasting. use alone for lighter coverage or with a liner for more drama. LOVE."
101,101,chanel,rouge allure velvet luminous matte lip colour,pimprod2030102,2605449,"  Beautiful color  Chanel has always been a quality brand, and it shows in this lipstick. I prefer mattes, but they are always so drying and tend to feather and make your lips look horrible. Not this lipstick. It is moisturizing, multidimensional and rich in color. I have extremely fair skin, medium copper hair and brown eyes. I purchased #45/Intense, and it is the most beautiful, vibrant shade that brings light to my face. I have so many other lipsticks, and I keep reaching for this one.  The Ulta associate helped me find a beautiful shade of red (#69) that's soft and deep at the same time. What I love most is how long lasting this lipstick is - no drying or feathering. it is just perfect! so pleased!  Chanel lipsticks are iconic. This shade is beautiful on very fair skin, which I have‚Ä¶also brings out my blue eyes and makes my s&p hair sparkle. It goes on smooth and has great staying power. Bottom line: it's a fun shade!  I am soooo upset I wish I can upload pictures here to show you all! When I got the package the box of the item was OPENED. the lipstick itself was OPENED. To top it off the whole top of the lipstick was smushed. Like if you popped up the lipstick and just put the top of it on and closed it. NEVER AGAIN FROM ULTA.  This is a beautiful nude/pinkish shade that provides solid, lasting color coverage without drying or flaking.  The packaging is innovative, as it is designed to never pop open in purse or makeup bag.  Highly recommended.  Bought #56 because it's the perfect red! I'm a flight attendant and can not wait for masks to come off! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíÑ"
102,102,charlotte tilbury,airbrush flawless matte lip blur liquid lipstick,pimprod2043380,2619476,"  I am super impressed with this lip blur!

Obviously it's for people who throw money down the drain because it's the same as a $7 product! Wanted to like it but absolutely not!  Very drying. Color goes on darker than is shown."
103,103,rabanne,famous lipcolor metallic lipstick,pimprod2041398,2614806,"  I was excited to receive this lipstick.  When it arrived, I immediately opened it.  To my surprise I noticed it was not as light as advertised or shown online. 
Its darker (mauve) and very matte.  I was looking for a very soft pink more like cotton candy. 

I mixed it with a nude color didn't work. 

I will continue to use it possibly w/lip gloss but will not buy again.  I've been looking for a good metallic lipstick for months, they're hard to find. I never tried this brand but I sampled it and liked it. It goes on easy and is moisturizing enough to stay on after a meal for the most part. I'm more than impressed and will be trying other products as well.  Beautiful color. Very hydrating. Scrub your lips this formula picks up any little crumb on you lip. The color does fade away. It never fully goes away its just the ""metallicness"" kinda fades away. I dont think id be buying the metallic color from them again. I would like to other colors. Formula is really really nice"

I even went home and used a lip primer but it didn't seem  to help. I returned it.  I like it  I wish the packaging was more higher end - looks like kid makeup. Color was not as shown online, not pink at all more neutral but i still liked it. Love the formula - very smooth and I love an unscented lipstick. Becasue most companies have scents and i dont like my lips smelling like perfume, i usually buy MAC and NYX. I would buy this again but probably in person so I can see/test the color.  I love this lipstick, it's almost the exact shade of Charlotte Tilburry's pillow talk medium. It's a bit darker than it, however that was just what i was looking for. Not the most moisturizing, but layered over a lip mask is perfect.  My perfect go-to lip color. Lasts several hours and so lovely.  Kylie lipsticks are the best by far !!! The colors are beautiful and they stay on for a long time . The only lipstick I wear is Kylie  i love this lipstick.  very comfortable matte. i purchased the shade you could never and it is the perfect brown. im very pale and so many browns turn too dark or too red. this is a beautiful neutral. it will definitely be in my bag everyday."
107,107,pat mcgrath labs,mattetrance lipstick,pimprod2040430,2613802,"  This is my favorite lipstick üíÑ  I've worn a neutral true red lip almost daily for over two decades.  About 7-8 years ago, when my daughter (a MUA) brought home a tube of Pat McGrath Elson MatteTrance from London Fashion Week, it immediately became my only and forever.  It's non-drying, incredibly smooth, and feels weightless.  [My only complaint is that the cap can be a bit hard to get off.]  

Since McGraths are super pigmented, I always use a clear pencil liner, then apply the lipstick sparingly with a brush and do the blot/build/blot for long-lasting color.  On hot, windy days here in the desert, I top it with Ulta Pumped Up Pout in Blushing without any color loss. 

I < used to> wear Elson exclusively.  Last fall, when I complained that I needed to re-up on Elson but it's weirdly always out of stock, my daughter rolled her eyes and told me some insider reported it's Taylor's fave so Swifties are compulsively snapping it up as soon as it hits stores; not even she could get it.  She suggested I try Vendetta (lovely neutral red, a tiny bit more subtle than Elson) with my ""winter uniform"" of black cashmere sweaters and jeans.  It's a good alternative.  Honestly, with the way I apply it, the difference between the two colors is barely perceptible.  Was disappointed when I swatched this, its not matte at all.  I bought a mini set kit with 3 colors and omi was my fav on the lip. So i bought the full lippie. I am absolutely in love with this color and how smooth it glides on  THIS IS THE BEST LIPSTICK IVE EVERRRRR USED!! I usually ever go for a gloss or lip cream.  This lipstick stayed on for hours at work without applying! It didnt settle in my lip lines or get gummy or bleed! 10/10  Was so excited about this lipstick, the color full blooded was so beautiful. When I got home and opened it, it was broken at the base so I had to return it  This lipstick is very comfortable.  It gives a more velvety matte finish that is super comfortable and lasts.  It almost blurs the look of my lip lined as well.  Love 1995, Femmbot and Elson."
108,108,essence,8h matte liquid lipstick,pimprod2040254,2611182,"  I wanted to try a matte lip color. It could have just been the brand or that it was a liquid matte but it just looked like I had dry lips and needed some moisturizer.i asked the staff there whom couldn't give any advice for an older woman. I tried it, don't like it at all. I don't recommend for older women  i love this so much the texture is amazing! it feels as if nothing is on your lips which is perfect for me since sometimes texture can bother me especially when lipstick feels heavy.
this also isnt sticky at all and goes on very smoothly and lasts for hours! it definitely fades and needs re applying after a while but i love it  I was really looking for the 'mousse' but had to settle for the 'matte'  OK substitute but more color variety would be nicer.  I wanted to love this! The color is beautiful however it's not pigmented enough.  Kiss proof and transfer proof lasts all day  These are my FAVORITE, i have one in every color. Ever since i found out about these lipsticks I've never went back to another one! For that price its WORTH it.  I've been looking for a long wear red lipstick, and this fits the bill. Classic red is a beautiful bright red, that lasts through eating and drinking. It's not sticky at all, and it feels lightweight on the lips."
109,109,p√É¬ºr,silky tint creamy multitasking stick,pimprod2044097,2620460,"  Very nice cheek and lip tint. I am very fair and have a neutral to cool undertone and the shade berry was a beautifully natural pink blush for me. I have also used it on my eyelids as a eyeshadow which I have liked to coordinate my lip, cheek and eye color.  such a great shade. soooo creamy! great price too  These were my first two PUR products. I was won over by the creaminess with light coverage. I have shades Bronze Babe I use for contour. Then I have Berry Blast I use for blush. These are very versatile sticks can use for face, eyes, lips. They spread well and if you need more color, then just add more. Absolutely obsessed with these.  Saw these with Jamie Greenberg so I bought today in store. Literally soooo blendable. A dreamy product. Great price.  I purchased the Berry Best and it glides on smoothly and so easy to blend in with my fingers.   Color is great!  This brand is sooo under rated. I am truly obsessed with this stick in Coral Cosmo!! It is the perfect peachy coral for spring. So buildable.  Has a gorgeous finish by itself or worn over foundation, and blends easily with fingers or a sponge. I got the shade ""berry best,"" and it is such a pretty color."
110,110,revlon,colorstay limitless matte liquid lipstick,pimprod2043452,2618837,"  The way I wanted to love this... the color is absolutely beautiful, the dry-down time is minimal and once it has dried, it truly is transfer proof (without being too drying on the lips). However the initial application was difficult - it was streaky and hard to get an even application (particularly on my bottom lip for some reason - I think you can see in the picture). The formula is unique, it almost feels like a stain in that it's on the thinner side. I'm not 100% sold on this one but I will definitely be testing it out more because the pros do outweigh the cons!  Left lipstick on everything. I have been using a lipstick that does not come of on anything so very disappointing.  Unlike most of the reviewers prior to myself, I did not receive this for free; I purchased it myself because I hope that it would be a really budge proof liquid lipstick. It's not.  I love the color that I chose and while it's not an overly uncomfortably drying liquid lipstick, it definitely transfers which is unfortunate. I can get a couple of hours out of it before it starts fading and it doesn't fade very gracefully; it always ends up looking a bit patchy. If you're looking for a transfer proof liquid lipstick, I wouldn't suggest this one."
111,111,revlon,colorstay suede ink lipstick,pimprod2036479,2605547,"  This was amazing! It did come off some from eating, but i dont think thats fair- greasy food and lipstick arent gonna last! But this was fresh after 12 hours of work (only drank soda and protein drinks when it lasted 12 hours!)  Literally my everyday affordable matte lipstick. I always get so many compliments and it will last ALL DAY! Only con is after 6+ hours it gets a little flakey but its really not bad and at that point I just reapply it.  I would not buy this again as it was very gritty and chunky.  Ok, so I've given matte lipsticks as good a run as I possibly could, but never mind how much they claim to be 'comfortable and lightweight,' or 'non-drying' they simply don't work for me.  I invariably end up with dry, crusty, chalky lips.  Yuck!  Disgusting.

I'm as sick of the matte LS trend as I am of that other annoying and equally never-ending trend: the 'dewey' (read, greasy) foundation.  I wish we could go back to soft matte or satiny foundations, and creamy, satiny lipsticks, as they were always intended to be.  Love it so much mi lips  with color all day  so dry and chalky on the lips, will emphasize any dry patches and settle into fine lines. i will give it points for being long lasting and pigmented, but it is just not flattering at all. i will stick with the maybelline matte ink crayons!  I love how this lipstick dries to a matte finish! And it stays on well all day"

If feels too matte strongly!!!  My ol lady loves it ,, and ima keep buying it so i can see her happy even more !"
113,113,chanel,rouge coco bloom hydrating plumping intense shine lip colour,pimprod2030105,2580147,"  Gorgeous color, very moisturizing.  absolutely obsessed with the color 142 Burst! it truly is beautiful! I've wanted a Chanel lipstick forEVER and was so excited to finally buy one! love everything except the lipstick doesn't come to a point so some more technical areas were hard to apply and the tube is seriously so cheap feeling. I really expected more out of the dispenser.  First time buying channel lipstick and was not disappointed. Beautiful color  Never had any problems with lipsticks before but after my first use I had an allergic reaction now im stuck confused on what it could be because ive used drugstore lipsticks in the past and had no problems  Destiny is a super flattering bright pinky red. It leaves a nice stain and is hydrating. It looks fresh, not like you're wearing a ton of makeup. I have a ton of red lippies & Chanel makes some of my favorite. When I run out of Destiny, I will buy it again. 10/10 would recommend.  Very moist and lasting great color  its VERY buildable. I am a brown girl and it suits me very well. I just dab it on and its gorgeous I will def be buying another one!"
114,114,l'or√É¬©al,glow paradise balm-in-lipstick,pimprod2029868,2590938,"  Unfortunately, this didn't work for me.  It wasn't hydrating and barely provided any color.  If you want a product that feels like chapstick this  is it.  It feels like there is nothing on your lips.  The description for shade 130 is a ""neutral pink"" but it has an orangey tone and was very unflattering on my skin tone. Unfortunate because the consistency and feeling on was great. Will be returning  It is a fresh, moisturizing and enhanced natural looking lipstick that is quite flattering and easy to wear. My absolute favorite now! I've gotten rid of all the others I have as this is all I need!  Really nice color, almost matches my nude lip. I got Mulberry Bliss, and would definitely repurchase. Lipstick can be a little dry and gritty though it is usually comfortable. In my experience feels best when layered with a similarly colored gloss or clear gloss.  Its perfect if you don't wear a lot of makeup like myself. The smell is tolerable and it is light wait its like a light lip oil  i got nude heaven, i love how it kinda matches my lip color, feels nice on the lips pretty color, i wish it was little more shiny on the lips"
115,115,smashbox,be legendary prime & plush lipstick,pimprod2022163,2578560,"  This is the perfect soft, warm pink for my light/neutral skin tone. It is comfortable and lasts for several hours. It has a slight sheen and a little bit of slip. 5 stars.  i liked this lipstick but the color was too bright for me...  This lipstick has a beautiful texture and feels very soft and moisturizing. I usually use longwear/ stain lip products. This held up quite well- though it requires a bit more frequency of applications during the day than a stain it is worth it. Great color / pigment. Definitely looking forward to trying out more colors.  These are my favorite lipsticks, i have many brands including C.T and PMG, which i have been disappointed woth both mentioned brands. I was not expecting to love Prime and Plush so much. I have five shades; First Time, Stepping Out, Level Up, Literal Queen and Poolside. I love them all, but Literal Queen is definitely my favorite color for a pink that Barbie would aprrove of. My second favorite color is Level Up. I would buy all of them if i could they are so bomb  The shade is so flattering, I use it for that hint of pinky lips. Sometimes applied with the finger tips for a soft look. Super creamy, hydrates my lips very well and it is long lasting.  The shade Disorderly is such a gorgeous brick red. I'd say it's closer to a garnet red. Gorgeous, with no pink tones which every red lipstick seems to add. Looks great on my light olive skin. Gives a very plush and hydrating feel without slipping and sliding all over. It will transfer of course, but it stays on during otherwise normal wear. It doesn't pull a disappearing act like many others. I will be buying a few others for sure.  This is my least favorite shade of the three I splurged on, the others being Stepping Out and Spoiler Alert. Dont get me wrong, this is a beautiful color, goes on smoothly and lasts. It's one star off simply bc it's a little dark for me. I'm a light/medium mature woman who loves mauves but I have to play this color down a bit worn by itself. I did that of course and am very pleased with this shade that way but by itself it's a bit too dark for me. All of these go on smoothly and the mauve colors are great, especially combined. Beautiful colors, lots in the little tubes, would def'ly repurchase this great formula."

I love this lipstick but really wish you'd bring back the Jungle shade. I can't color match it anywhere else.  I've been looking for the Jungle shade. Where did it go? Ulta, what can I get in the meanwhile? Recommendations please. This is my favorite lip crayon in the store.  Love this shade, it stays on and fits my budget.  I love the formula. I have used it for 6+ years. But where did the favorite color Jungle go!?! It matched my favorite shirt and dress perfectly! Ulta please help?  It was what I wanted and in my budget. I will buy it again!  Will buy again  not my favorite but it isnt bad. the color was different then described and shown"
119,119,chanel,rouge allure luminous intense lip colour,pimprod2030096,2607861,"  illusion is the color I have and it's a perfect nude. I use several different lip liners and they all seem to go perfectly! Charlotte Tilbury iconic nude or even pillow talk .. so beautiful. and it makes the lipstick lasts longer.  I bought this lipstick for the reviews and what it says on how long it lasts, well it does not last more than two hours very disappointing on paying alot of money on a product does not last long. It does go on smooth but that's all it does will I buy again probably not. I want a lipstick that moisturizes my lips and will last alot more than two hours.  Beautiful finish - shinier than satin, but not glossy. Potent pigment, color lasts long for luminous lipstick. Hydrating. I didn't want to like it because it's so expensive, but I love it. Subtile is perfect for everyday wear.  Actually, I just did!  This purchase was to replace the tube I ""lost"" in a recent move.  Pirate is a perfect red!  So happy the Chanel line is in Ulta!  I got Subtile 211 but could've bought Pirate (cool tone bright red) and Angelique (luminous warm red pink) as well, and probably will end up doing so because all the shades are spectacular.  I enjoyed these more than the Chanel Duo Tenue stains, which I found too dry.  This is really the perfect balance of moisture, pigment and satin finish.  A+++++  Probably the best Red lipstick! Goes on smoothly and lasts the entire evening! Looks great on all skin types. So happy that Ulta is now carrying some Chanel!  I bought the ROUGE ANG√âLIQUE color and it is a natural looking color.  I have been wearing it everyday to work.  I have olive skin and big lips and have a hard time finding lipsticks that look good without being overbearing."
120,120,morphe 2,good talk blotted matte lipstick,pimprod2037788,2604647,"  Bought after reading all the positive reviews and am very disappointed. It is way too dry. Doesn't even start off feeling moisturizing, its just straight up chalky dry upon applying. Color was also way off. The pink has severe orange undertones.  Beautiful shade. Applied like like a blotted matte. Lasted a decent amount of time. Definiely apply after extoliating lips.  Another review had mentioned it and its true! these are a great dupe for the Glossier Gen G matte lipsticks! they give that amazing blotted lip look at a great, affordable price! if you're more fair id recommend picking up pink pucker or cocoa cutie!  I usually like wearing darker shades in the winter and this gave me that darker rich velvet burgundy look I was going for  One of my most used lippies, because it doesn't dry me out, and it genuinely looks amazing. I have both Cocoa Cutie and the Red Sunset colors, and I have found that these both somehow look most natural while improving my lip color, so basically magic. Would definitely get more of these in different colors, but I'm not big into pinks.  I'm a redhead and I got the cocoa cutie shade. On my fair skin it was a nice light orange brown. I will say to use this with a light hand to get the best results I think if you go too heavy handed it will be more cakey and drying. I like the look of the ""soft matte gradient lip"" look (which is a korean beauty trend) and I think this lipstick achieves that look very well. Also it works well with lip oils and balms and keeps its color if you want to add a shine finish instead.  So, im typical not the one to like the feelings of lipsticks on my lips since they normally sink into my fine lines and make my lips look superrrr crusty. HOWEVER, my older brother's girlfriend had gifted this to me for my birthday and I have fallen in love with it. This lipstick with a good lip liner is my go-to lip combo. It's extremely long lasting and doesn't exaggerate the fine lines in my lips. Its super affordable too and I will DEFINITELY repurshase when I run out of the one I have!!"
121,121,ulta beauty collection,dual ended lipstick & liner,pimprod2043307,2616004,"  The liner portion of the duo goes on nice and smooth unfortunately I could not test the lip color no matter how many times I twist it up  The shade on the swatch totally different than how it wears. Returning item.  I absolutely love this duo pen and the color! When I want a more nature look I pair it with Ulta lip lacquer Foxy Charme. It is also very long lasting even when eating and drinking.  I wear this and everyone asks what I'm wearing :) my fav!!  I picked this up last minute, I'm always looking for a lip liner that matches my lips. This is great! I love the dual end for liner or lipstick. I also have been using it for blush and some eyeshadow too!  Love this product!! Already bought two colors. It's amazing having the lip liner and the lip color in one. The double down color is beautiful. And great price. Love this:)  Love the 2 in one. Very convenient"
122,122,essence,the slim stick lipstick,pimprod2045848,2625500,"  Its so gorgeous!! I wanted to try it out and it's soo creamy.  Just bought Baby Got Blush and Brickroad. I love them! The colors are beautiful and they are very creamy. Test is underway now to see how long they last. I'm in love!!!  On me, the color ""Over the Nude"" is more neutral than peachy, but that's okay because it looks and wears like M¬∑A¬∑CXIMAL Silky Matte Viva Glam Lipstick in Viva Planet...at least on my lips it does. It's opaque and creamy even though it's matte. And what a price!! I wish they had more truly warm peachy nude tones in this formula...it's a great lipstick for the price!  I have the Sweet Copper color. Based on the color on the box and packaging, I thought this was going to be a different shade. The description also says ""brown"", but this is more of a bright, chili red. Either way, I loved it! The color STAYS long!"
123,123,est√É¬©e lauder,pure color whipped matte lip color with moringa butter,pimprod2030739,2591245,"  This lipstick is a winner  Bought 2 shades online, but colors are way lighter than advertised. Not suitable for dusky girlies at all - cocoa whip, more like a light peach, and social whirl is a very bright fluorescent pink color. Stay away. Not transferproof either .  dries down matte but is not dehydrating and is super comfy on the lips!!  Bought this for my 93 year old mom who still puts her makeup on every day. She loved the color, not too bright and looks really pretty on her.  I really like the shade.Unfortunately, it seem that it was used  Perfect color and lasts all day  Love it"
124,124,laura mercier,petal soft lipstick crayon,pimprod2033906,2599318,"  I bought Jeanne and Ella and as a 35 year old mom who likes a no makeup makeup look.. these lip crayons are the best!  I wanted to love this, but the color is not the same shade shown.  The color Ella has more of an orange tint rather then the pink blush tint shown.  It also must be reapplied often as the color doesn't last.  This is the most amazing product! Associate in store recommended for a cream Blush option. I love it on my cheeks and lips! Long lasting and moon drying. Doesn't create or settle in pores or wrinkles when used as a blush. Just buy it!!!!  the color turns orange-ish on me, tho it's termed a pink and has zero staying power, none  I got the shade Elodie and it's just what I was looking for! A midtone dusty mauve that's not too brown or purple but *pink*. It's so hard to find true mauves! This is perfect for my fair complexion and just what I wanted! The shape of the crayon and weight is great, applies easily and smoothly! Feels light and silky, not at all like you're wearing lipstick! It won't last all day but that's fine, no lipstick really does. Has a satiny finish and a my lips but better look. So in love!  This is my second of these lippies and I love them. I recommend them, pretty and hydrating.  I got the color Zoe and it's a perfect shade for me. I have fair cool toned skin. It gives a soft diffused look. It will transfer, not terribly so, but I do wish it lasted a bit longer. I like the ease of application and the color payoff. I think I would buy it again if it were on sale."
125,125,est√É¬©e lauder,pure color explicit slick shine lipstick,pimprod2044527,2618890,  Most high shine lipsticks have a very shirt wear time. Im able to get a few hours out of this one. 'Out of time' is a beautiful neutral pink shade on my light/medium skin tone. Feels very hydrating on. I cant wait to get some more shades!
126,126,too faced,cocoa bold cream lipstick,pimprod2033934,2596626,"  I have been searching for the perfect pink nude and chocolate strawberry is it.  Isnt too pale or too dark.  Its just the right tone.  Feels good on the lips, a creamy matte.  Hope they dont stop making this as I will want to keep re purchasing  I remember coming across these lipsticks in an Ulta sale once and I contemplated getting one because they were on sale lol, bur i never did. A day later they hadnt left my mind so i did research and purchased Ganache and omg‚Ä¶. its AMAZING, for a kinda tan hispanic the color is GIVING
!! I will literally wear this everyday, take it with me if i end up stranded. These are such beautiful nudes and even the packaging gives so much< 3 i will never stop buying Ganache for sure and i will try other colors in the future.  i love the color, but unfortunately it literally broke the first time i used it  The lipstick goes on real creamy and smooth. Also it stays on for most of the day.  Hot Chocolate is the perfect nude for me. It doesn't wash me out. Perfect nude color for my light brown skin. Stays on comfortably for hours!  This is the perfect color for a nude lip. Pinky brown. Goes on real smooth on the lips  Creamy matte and so comfortable! smells exactly like a chocolate chip milkshake, but scent is not overwhelming at all!  So pretty on the lips!"
127,127,juvia's place,nubian earth lipstick,pimprod2033077,2598699,"  This lipstick is amazing! I have darkskin and it looks stunning on me.  I had been looking for a dark color, near black but not black, that wasn't burgundy or purple and I finally found it! Sheeba is exactly what I was looking for, a cool dark brown and it looks amazing on! This is my first Juvias product and it did not disappoint. The lipstick is creamy and feels hydrating and the color is very pigmented with just one application. Will definitely be buying more of these lipsticks, I love my MAC but these are just as good and cheaper.  The color stays true on my dark hyperpigmented lips.  I just love it  I agree with another review saying this is a yellow-brown. Almost has the slightest green-olive tone. I LOVE it for my yellowy-olive medium-light skin tone. I use this with an orange-rose to mix in center (shown in pic). Hand swatch pic is pure Nile.  I absolutely love this product!!! It last through out the day, and the color is absolutely gorgeous! If you haven't tried it you're missing out!!!!  This color was exactly what i was wanting‚Ä¶ did an ombre lip with this and it was beautiful  I love the creamy texture of this lipstick! I received so many compliments when I last wore it on Thanksgiving."
128,128,l'or√É¬©al,colour riche les nus intense lipstick,pimprod2020713,2575586,"  Pretty colors, smoothing, satin sheen, pigmented  I really like the feel and look of this lipstick. It has a sheer glossy look to it. I need a darker shade, I'm olive skin and it doesn't show much on me.  I have been a high end lipstick girl for years, favoring Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk. Somehoe i came across the Nu Impertinent as a dupe so I decided to try it. It's definitely a dupe but I actually like the color better than CT and the formula us much creamier. I ended up buyinh two more colors: Nu Excessif and Nu Confident and I love then both!  it looks a little off when i first applied it, but its very creamy  It flakes  I like the color and texture  I usually have good luck with L'Oreal lip products, so I was surprised by how disappointed I was with this one. I purchased Nu Excessif, which on my fair was straight up orange. Not flattering. The formula is thin, and yet somehow looks cakey and settles horribly into lip lines that I didn't even know I had. It's patchy, doesn't last long, and bunches up in the corners of my mouth after talking and/or eating. And the scent. Who thought it was a good idea to put a nauseating old-lady rose scent in a lipstick? I feel like a lipstick, because it will inevitably get in my mouth, should smell/taste like something I would want to eat rather than the hand soap that's been in my grandma's bathroom for a decade."

130,130,wyn beauty,word of mouth max comfort matte lipstick,pimprod2044283,2622307,"  very moisturizing and doesnt dry and lips. not hard to clean off either. love the colors.  I was really excited for the shade Amped, described as a Berry shade, but wanted to try it on in person, so I headed to the Ulta at the Mall of America! When I got there to try this shade, I was confused as it looked like the shades Amped and Express had heen swapped! Looking at Ulta online and Wyn's website, the shades were listed at Amped being a berry and Express being a vibrant rose, but in person Amped was the vibrant rose and Express was the berry! I ended up getting Express, but now I'm curious if I would have ordered online if this color swap issue would be the same for that! It's a bit confusing, but whichever name is supposed to be the berry shade, it's a great color! I guess just make sure to double-check these shades in person or hopefully they'll update their online swatches if they're accidentally swapped!  When Ms. Serena Williams labled her matte lipstck as comfortable, SHE MEANT IT. And it in fact delivers. I never thought i would find a lipstick more comfortable than the best chapstick but i was wrong. I definitly an lurchasing more colors  I was going to restock on MAC lipstick and saw this one instead. I went ahead and bought one to try and I love it. Now i'm adding more shades to my cart. I also love that this has few ingredients compared to other brands and it's a plus that it has castor oil, my lips don't feel dry with it on.  These lipsticks remind me of MAC Powder Kiss lipsticks, but even more comfortable and long-wearing. They have a beautiful, blotted finish. I especially love the colors ""Tell"" (a plummy rose) and ""Cheer"" (a rusty soft red).  This stays on and leaves a stain for a bit.  No lipstick stays on me like promised bc I drink water and eat all day long like a normal person. So yes this stays on longer than most but still it fades as per usual. I'm not mad about it. I liked it.  I dont like lipstick but this one is perfect! I found a great shade and it feels amazing on your lips. I forogt it was there"
131,131,half magic,mouth cloud soft matte lip cream,pimprod2040564,2611521,"  I got this as a free gift w purchase and I cant believe how good it is! Moisturizerizing, little/ no transfer color is beautiful im a huge fan just ordered a few more!  The pop of pink in ""invoice attached"" is truly fantastic! It feels light on the lips and fades into a stain with minimal transfer. But what really sold me on this product was the way my lips felt after removing it at night - so pillowy smooth.  I have been wearing another long wearing lip gloss for a very long time. But I am constantly looking for other new long wearing lip glosses. So I bought this one and I'm impressed. It cost less than many of the others, there are beautiful colors and it is long wearing without being sticky pr drying my lips.  One of my friendd got me house wife dreamz and I love it! It's not overwhelmingly orange, but is still pretty pigmented. Also, I LOVE the texture.  I love these. I love matte lip colors but alot of them will dry my lips out. this one doesn't do that. the color is beautiful as well.  I randomly picked up the shade ""invoice attached"" saying ""where was this when I went to the barbie movie"" anyway I swatched it and decided I needed it and now im sitting in my house with no makeup but this on my lips & I love it so much. it's so comfy its truly a soft matte feel & finish. the applicator makes it really easy to get the corners of your mouth and cupids bow. It isnt transfer proof (& doesnt claim to be) but I think as it wears off you could just add a clear gloss on top.  I got this in the shade Magic Brownie. I love a soft, diffused lip, and this formula feels excellent. It's creamy and smooth and reminds me of a fancier Colourpop Ultra Blotted Lip. I have fair, cool-toned skin, so it's been hard to find a flattering brown-toned lip shade. Magic Brownie is a beautiful color on me! It's very unique and it's not like any sort of brownish-red lip I've ever tried. I imagine it'll look fantastic with gloss too. This will definitely become a staple for me."
132,132,hourglass,unlocked soft matte lipstick,pimprod2042885,2620493,"  I was a bit worried about spending so much on this lipstick since it was online and I had no idea if the color would fit me or I'd like the texture, however, once I put it on, I absolutely loved it. I got Sparrow, and its a beautiful nude brown with some hints if gray (on my skintone, neutral medium tan). The lipstick applys smoothly with easy removal, and fills the lines and creases of the lips beautifully. It doesn't feel drying or thick, feels natural on the lips. The packaging is very luxurious feeling and I like the magnetic feature. If you're hesitant about the price, don't be, especially if its a color you adore and can't find anywhere else. It's worth the initial price!  I received the Unlocked Soft Matte Lipstick in Foxglove from Hourglass in exchange for this post.  It is a berry rose shade that I don't have. I love matte lipsticks, and this shade I can wear for everyday even going to church. I love it is very comfortable and feel very thin in my lips.  I absolutely love the formula of this. It glided on so easily and provided such a beautiful color to the lips. This shade (""Sparrow"") especially is so versatile I found that it looks amazing on my medium skin tone as well! I love that the packaging is magnetic, but also not too heavy so it's perfect for on the go. It has a very light scent and is not overpowering at all. If you're looking for a good quality lipstick, this one's for you !! ü•∞  Hourglass doesn't disappoint and this was another home run from them. Super comfortable matte formula with a soft focus finish. Love the shape of the bullet for precision application and the packaging is extremely chic and elegant. Makes the whole lipstick experience a really luxurious moment. The formulas also wears really nicely. Doesn't get dry or crusty on the lips and reapplication is a breeze.  The Hourglass Soft Matte Lipstick is a game-changer! Its velvety texture glides on effortlessly, delivering rich, long-lasting color without drying out the lips. The matte finish is flawless and comfortable to wear, making it a must-have for any makeup enthusiast.  The new Hourglass Unlovked Soft Matte Lipstivks have to be my new favorite lipsticks! First off, the packaging is absolutely stunning! The lipsticks are so creamy and pigmented. They are not your typical matte lipsticks by any means, as they are not the least bit dry. I can't wait to add even more shades to my collection!  . I love the original formula of this lipstick line, but I'm like matte finish better. This formula is amazing!! Super comfortable, very smoothing on the lip line, easy to apply, beautiful shades too."

I decided to order this to try it out. Terrrrrrible, I  put it on in the bathroom, got in the car, and looked in the mirror, it was allllll over my chin area. I fixed it thinking I had done something wrong. It happened again! Still on the hunt for something that lasts longer than 30 minutes.  After reading reviews I thought I'd give this a try - it's awful.  Takes forever to dry, and travels outside lip lines.  Thankfully I only ordered the travel size, but a complete waste of money.  I've been using LipSense for 20 years...I'll stick with that.  I saw AOC speak on a hot summer day at an immigrant rights protest in Queens. Everyone was sweating buckets. AOC spoke eloquently with righteous anger. She looked beautiful and flawless despite the heat. STILA stay all day in Beso is her lip color.  This is a very rich red . Very classy red . I have blue undertones so it fit very well .  Beso is a beautiful true red color. I do apply with a brush. Love option of smaller size for purse."
135,135,laura mercier,high vibe lip color,pimprod2037498,2603398,"  nice light formula but it lasts awhile.  I didn't end of loving the Mauve color on me, and wish I tried something slightly pinker/plumier.  This is such a beautiful spring pink.  It's not too bright, not too dark-it's just right.  It also has some beautiful subtle gold sparkle to it.  It applies very easily, stays on incredibly well, and doesn't dry out my lips.  I found the perfects, long lasting lipstick, stain, balm all in one. Leaves a lovely stain, even after pizza! Beautiful colors. I bought Pop and Bright. I also love that this brand is healthy and cruelty free.  I'm obsessed with this product. Not only the shade is perfect for an everyday nude with just a pop of color but the FEEL of this lip product is amazing. It's def not a long wear but I knew that. I wanted moistened silk feeling lips and this is what I get so I'm happy to re apply  I really wanted to love this. But I'm disappointed to say, it makes my lips dry and sinks into every lip crease I have. Feels slippery and doesn't last at all.  Great color and lasts quite a while. It leaves a stain and I just put lip gloss over it and good to go.  Absolutely love the ""glowiness"" of the color ""Joy""‚Ä¶a very neutral sheen, that can go warm or cool, depending on what sort of lipliner and/or lip color you apply OVER it. (I prefer a bit more of a matte texture finish, which this does not have.)"
136,136,stila,deluxe mini stay all day liquid lipstick,pimprod2002379,2535177,"  I like the color it was beautiful for 60-year-old. It made me look useful.  Stila has gorgeous pigment.  It goes on smooth, and stays put. It is very rare that I ever have to reapply during the day. It doesn't feel dry on the lips, and the color does not fade. Patina was my first favorite liquid lipstick, and years and years later it is still my favorite. The shade, consistency, the wear, the comfort, the pigment‚Ä¶SHE IS JUST THAT GIRL! ü©∑. Highly reccommend.  Stays on well  Good color. Lasts a long time.  I love Stila lipstick so I wanted a more everyday neutral shade so I ordered Baci which plainly states ""nude pink"" just opened it and it is far far away from any shade of pink, it is purple, looks nothing like shown or described online.  Love this color looks very pretty and just a nice classic color.  Love Stilla"

Its illegal to sell used makeup and yall sent me this lip prodeuct with the seal broken and nasty in the cap. there was a stained filthy fingerprint on the side of it.  LAWYER. that  aint legal  Very Cheap ! Coming off very ugly ! Do not recommend! I don't know how anybody can like it!  everytime you close your lips you feel the stickiness abd its annoying  I bought this lipstick for the really nice red color variety but upon using the lipstick there is a really strong and unpleasant smell. Not a big fan of the dryness it leaves your lips feeling. Don't recommend at all.  I ordered two colors. They look beautiful on the website. However BOTH arrived open! Im tired of ordering products from Ulta and they are always open. I live far from the closest Ulta and lose out money cos I cant return them. It's disgusting and unsanitary no matter how many times you clean it. Now I am stuck with two expensive products that I'll never use.  This product stays on forever! 
Even after eating and drinking. I love it!  Their formula is sticky but makes my lips dry at the same time. The tip is not flexible. It is only superstay all day if you don't eat or drink."

I keep it stored upright, it wasnt exposed to warm temps as its December in Ohio, it was never dropped and I hadnt turned the bottom to raise the product up because at this point so early on I hadn't realized it even raised up.  I am extremly bummed, such a waste but I'm glad it happened before I went out & got more shades, exactly what I had intended on doing."
139,139,kiko milano,jelly stylo,pimprod2018556,2571238,"  I typically never write reviews but I just recieved my Kiko jelly stylo in the mail today and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ it's absolutely gorgeous. I got the shade 501 starry rose and it looks amazing. The glitter shows up so well and the formula feels great on the lips. I'm excited to try more shades of this!!  It's like a luxurious, silky treat every time I put it on. I can't get enough of how amazing it makes me feel and how it instantly adds a touch of glamour to my day. It is an absolute game-changer for me, and I can't recommend it enough!  Looks beautiful! Can feel the glitter a littleee bit but overall love the way it looks. Someone recommended over a lipstain and lets just say 10/10 combo. Happy with purchase.  I got the lightest shade and j was a little worried i'd end up looking like my concealer lip days üò¨ but it's actually really pretty. Very shimmery but not frosty. I would wear it over a lip stain to add a little color.  This is my new favorite lippie! The pigment is AMAZING and it feels more like a creamier lip balm. It has a nice shine and it's more than worth it's price point! I hope you love it as much as I do üíï  I absolutely love this jelly stylo!! I'm always looking for a good moisturizing lip gloss that lasts and isn't sticky. Well I found it! For some reason on my Ulta app I only have 2 colors to choose from but thats ok bc i do like the lighter color but other colors would be nice to try as well! I personally like purple lip color for my dark tan skin tone. Purple would be great Kiko!!  I love the lip balm it has a light tint and deeply moisturises my lips, my lips feels softer and hydrated"
140,140,rabanne,famous lipcolor metallic lipstick,pimprod2041398,2614804,"  I was excited to receive this lipstick.  When it arrived, I immediately opened it.  To my surprise I noticed it was not as light as advertised or shown online. 
Its darker (mauve) and very matte.  I was looking for a very soft pink more like cotton candy. 

I mixed it with a nude color didn't work. 

I will continue to use it possibly w/lip gloss but will not buy again.  I've been looking for a good metallic lipstick for months, they're hard to find. I never tried this brand but I sampled it and liked it. It goes on easy and is moisturizing enough to stay on after a meal for the most part. I'm more than impressed and will be trying other products as well.  Beautiful color. Very hydrating. Scrub your lips this formula picks up any little crumb on you lip. The color does fade away. It never fully goes away its just the ""metallicness"" kinda fades away. I dont think id be buying the metallic color from them again. I would like to other colors. Formula is really really nice"

142,142,r.e.m. beauty,on your collar matte lipstick,pimprod2032265,2595333,"  I was admiring this brand's great packaging and then decided to try their lipstick. I was impressed by the comfort, color, and wear, even though I already own so many favorites. I actually went ahead and bought another shade, the lip liner, and the cheek/lipstick product.  The lipstick didn't wear well, was constantly reapplying to keep the color even.  Definetly recommend for anyone looking for a light weight lipstick that lasts  when i say this is my favorite lipstick, i mean it 100%. i own every single shade. in every way, this product is perfect. it's matte, but not in any way drying. it's soft, buttery, & amazing. it leaves your lips feeling so nice. i've been through every single lipstick you can think of but this one, omg! perfect! i never even went in looking for this but the packaging looked so cute. it looks gorgeous, too! i need more shades! i swear by this lipstick & can assure you that you will not regret it.  I was excited to get this lipstick, and initially the consistency of it was very soft and smooth to put on, however my lipstick broke very quickly and easily with little pressure added to it. I wouldn't consider this high quality and not worth the price.  i love it, has cute packaging but not very functional because the lipstick doesnt go down all the way and will smudge on the cap if not careful  The color is pretty but the lipstick breaks easily."
143,143,kylie cosmetics,cr√É¬®me lipstick,pimprod2039150,2610193,"  I am on the fence on this one. Moisturizing which is great but it is also such a soft tube it broke off right away and is a pain to use without making a big mess since it is a richly pigmented color. I have lighter skin so certain colors would not work for me in this brand. Overall a good lipstick that lasts a reasonable time on and does not feather into fine lines.  This has a greasy feel and the color not sorry is the same as the lip kit nudes.  this is actually one of the best smelling lipsticks and lasts for a very long time  I had it on while I was out shopping for hours in hot weather and while I worked out for an hour right after and it literally lasted the ENTIRE time NO TOUCH UPS at all! It didn't bleed either.  Was looking for a new lipstick after my old brand changed their ingredients. this lipstick is amazing. so silky and soft on my lips.  Ok so I will be honest when I say that I'm not crazy about the Kardashan/Jenner clan. HOWEVER Kylie Jenner knows how to make makeup!! This lipstick is moisturizing, satin shine finish is perfection, and color payoff is incredible! Absolutely worth it.  This lipstick goes on super creamy and very pigmented. It's super smooth gliding on, however, the color online isn't a good representation of the actual color. It's a little lighter and has more red than brown/pink tones that i thought."
144,144,iconic london,multi-use lip and cheek cream palette,pimprod2038210,2608766,  This pallet is great because it is so versatile. You get six shades which is such a great deal! The shades are definitely more sheer but you can build them up to a beautiful flush of color!  Very smooth and goes on great!!  The colors are gorgeous but sheer. I expected them to be more pigmented. With the exception of the darkest shade I had to apply multiple layers to achieve a hint of color on my cheeks. Wears like a stain on the lips. For reference l have a medium deep skintone. Might work better on lighter skin shades.  It's got all the perfect shades you could ever wish for for your cheeks and your lips!   Great to use as eyeshadow as well!  Love love love these colors for spring and summer!!!!!!!!  :)  I love the concept behind the palette. powder blush palettes are more common  but I love cream blushes and thought awesome! I just wish it was more pigmented. I felt like I had to layer a lot to get the flush of color.  the elf putty blushes pack more of a punch than this. overall underwhelmed sadly.
145,145,kvd beauty,metallic everlasting hyperlight vegan transfer-proof liquid lipstick,pimprod2043018,2622268,"  PLEASE, if this brand does anything, bring back the old formula. This lipstick used to be my holy grail, until they switched formulas and it's TERRIBLE. Ever heard of the saying, ""If it aint broke, don't fix it?"" BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA, KVD. üôÑ  Ghost bloom looks like a super purple color when it's described as plum brown. The formula has changed from the old kvd I agree with others saying you need several layers of this. The packaging is pretty but feels light and cheap. Considering returning because it's not flattering.  Queen of Poisons is supposed to be the new name for the shade, Lolita, however, it is nowhere near the original Lolita shade. Very disappointing and will be returning.  The new lolita (queen of poisons) is nowhere near the shade of the old lolita. Very disappointing and will have to return!  It goes on smoothly and smells delicious like a cupcake or something. Very black. Perfect matte consistency.  KVD lipstick is my favorite but the lipstick is totally different than before. It's not as pigmented so you have to apply layers, which eventually makes your lips dry and lipstick turns flaky. I miss the old KVD liquid lipstick.  I have tried many lipsticks over the years and none of them can compare to the KVD Hyperlight Liquid Lipstick. It truly is lightweight and has wonderful pigment. It makes my lips feel smooth and sometimes I forget I'm even wearing it. I have multiple lipstick shades and I love them all!"
146,146,natasha denona,i need a nude lipstick,pimprod2038012,2606673,"  I like the lipstick, it's a nice creamy nude color that goes on well and doesn't dry out my lips. But, honestly? I'm totally in love with the packaging! It's heavy, sleek, and stays closed in my purse because of the magnetic closure. Feels very luxurious, and I'm secretly in love with pulling it out to reapply throughout the day.  I bought the shades Natasha and Beatrice. I love both shades. They are very comfortable and they are long lasting on me. I am fair skinned with blond hair and blue eyes..I do prefer pink nudes or beige pinks. The two shades I bought are perfect.  Not a long wear lipstick by any means, but looks gorgeous on and does last a while. Jenifer is my fave shade and Liron a close second. I love a little bit rosy nude lip, these are both lovely. I also have Noa, which is a little more brownish on me. I am fair skinned with auburn hair, if that helps anyone with picking shades. These were a little splurge for me with some OT!  This was my very first purchase of any Natasha Denona product and I'm hooked!  I ordered the color ""Beatrice"".  Everything was amazing from first opening the box and taking out the decadent tube to trying it on and falling in love with the gorgeous shade.  I'm blown away by how delicate this shade is but that it's still such a rich formulation.  It just feels so nice on my lips.  The color is neutral and matches almost all of my routine makeup combinations.  It applies and blends extremely well.  And it doesn't feel heavy or weighed down.  Love this lipstick very moisturizing. Best lipstick i have ever tried worth the extra money.  I've tried a lot of different lipsticks in my life. Probably 1000s. I was in the business of makeup artistry with a different vendor for a living, and this lipstick is by far worth the extra money. I've never put a review on Ulta, but I'm impressed with this lipstick. It doesn't pull moisture out of my lips; instead, it conditions and stays put all day long.  Very comfortable with just one swipe on lip lasts for  hrs without having to reapply"
147,147,fenty beauty by rihanna,fenty icon the case: semi-matte refillable lipstick,pimprod2031417,2592316,"  This lipstick case was so beautiful and made so well.  It embodies femininity!!  I was so excited to get to try this. It opens opposite of how you would think but feels sturdy and solid. However, I have applied the lipstick maybe 6 times and the case looks like I've had it for a decade bumping around in the bottom of a travel bag. I hate waste and love refillable options but the surface doesn't even hold up as well as a normal disposable lipstick tube. The mechanism still works perfectly though.  I was really excited to try the lipstick, but I don't see the point in the case. I shouldn't have to look up a video tutorial for simply putting the lipstick in the case. It should either come with instructions or just release a normal lipstick line.  can't even get the case to open!!!! Returning  I had a hard time figuring out how to use the case, primarily how to open it. It would be helpful to have a well done instruction video. But once I figured out the mechanics, I couldn't love it more. I also love the lipstick formula, so I'm never without one in my bag.  I didn't have trouble with the lipstick case, but it is easy to mess up your lipstick trying to open it.  Love"
148,148,too faced,lady bold cream lipstick,pimprod2024074,2622315,"  My favor product  Love this product  I bought the color Committed and I love it. It's somewhat creamy and the lipstick itself goes on boldly. I'm glad I tried it before I bought it because lipstick shades can be tricky, the picture looks good but looks terrible in person. I was not disappointed.  I purchased the Power Move which is a beautiful Hot Pink. Full color in one swipe. Cream texture. Stays in place all day. I personally prefer a shiny finish so I add a tiny bit of gloss GORGEOUS ! ‚ù§Ô∏è  I have been on the search for a lipstick thats not Matte nor do I want nude colors. I bought Power Pink and Unafraid. They are gorgeous and hydrating. Also very pigmented and wear for hours.  I love how easy it is to apply and it doesn't look cheap or smudge any like other brands do.  I wanted to love this lipstick but it's a hard no.  
Shade: ""I'm Thriving"" which is described as a muted beige pink. The color before putting it on is neither muted or beige tone, it is extremely bold mauve color, a brownish pink. Once on, the lipstick is bright orange. I didn't want to post a photo of it on my lips but included a swatch on my hand. The shade might be able to be corrected if layered with lip liner or gloss, but the lipstick is very messy, it spreads both inside and outside of the lips, my teeth turned a peachy orange from wearing it for about an hour. Very unhappy about the money wasted."
149,149,flower beauty,perfect pout moisturizing lipstick,pimprod2030713,2596258,"  Where has this lipstick been all my life. It's like a chapstick/lip balm in feel but looks like a high end lipstick. *orders in every color*  I love this lipstick! It's the perfect sheer, moisturizing, creme finish lipstick. I got the shade Blush Rose and it's a gorgeous cool-toned my-lips-but-better color for me (light neutral skin tone.) It's affordable AND it really is moisturizing.  I love these lipsticks! The color, the finish, everything about them is gorgeous. However, they don't last very long on my lips, which is why i took away one star, but they're so pretty I don't mind reapplying!  I don't wear a ton of lipstick but this is a new favorite. Satin finish with a smooth application. The shade Blossom is a good dupe for Clinique's Tenderheart at half the cost. This is a great choice for everyday lipstick.  It's a nice creamy feel but the color is VERY sheer. It just sits in my drawer because it's almost clear going on  I was just looking for a nice nude lipstick just to toss on when running around town and this is great for that. The color looks dark in the tube then on I got the color buttercup I kept putting it on because I was sure if it was my lips or the actual lipstick. It's very much your lips but better in terms of a nude lip for the price it's fine. I think the packaging needs some work. It feels like a plastic fork when holding it lol I feel like one drop it will break.  Shiny and sheer and feels good on the lips. Nice color too."
150,150,ofra cosmetics,gone mia mini liquid lipstick set,pimprod2031710,2594181,"  This set is perfect to sample shades you want to try but don't want to commit to purchasing full size yet. 
I loved the array of tones in the set as well.  I love all the colors! Their size makes them perfect to fit in your purse for a quick touch up!  I love all of these colors! They're beautiful. I also love mixing multiple colors together. It gives you so many options! üíã  This is offensive, the box with all four lipsticks inside isn't even 3in x 3in üò≠üòÇ  Love the formula of this lipstick. They are each a good size, about the length of my pinky finger, maybe a bit longer. Good price for 4 of them that size from this brand. Colors are cute. A+  I really love this kit! Easy to carry on your purse! I love the colors, I think they go really well with natural or more extravagant make up. I would definitelly purchase this kit because most the time I have to throw away my lipsticks because they expire, these are the perfect size‚ô°. I received this product complimentary from OFRA Cosmetics.  I really like the shades & the formula but the bottle is as small as my pinky, had I known I wouldn't bought them. other than that if you don't mind the price it's a nice way to test out some of ofra's liquid lipstick.
p.s the formula is super comfortable & mousse like."
151,151,ulta beauty collection,cloud kiss matte lip cream,pimprod2041917,2608675,"  I received a small size of this in a gift with purchase.  It doesn't have a shade name anywhere on it.  I do really love the formula and I'm not a matte girl at all.  I usually don't like the look of a matte lip product.  To me though, the smell of this stuff is terrible!  I can't think of what to compare it to but it stinks.  The smell does seem to dissipate after about 10 minutes but while it lingers the smell is very unpleasant to me.  I would recommend it due to the formula but I'm not sure I will buy it again for myself.  I was looking for a Matte Lipgloss I purchased with a combo pack called "" Into the stars"" that was clearenced somewhere and was told it was being disconnected.  It was the best matte lipgloss EVER, until rep found me something kinda like it but it definitely isn't what I am expected nor wanted  I was looking to purchase the large size of the sample lip gloss in the latest free gift. I was told that the color was jystvforctgstvgift and I was shown two similar, not the same at all when I brought it home. If a larger one is available can I have the name . It is not on the sample  I received a sample of the shade *Mauve. This is a beautiful formula. Whipped, creamy, comfortable & looks beautiful on the lips. The scent is artificially pleasant, but I don't care for the taste. Sits on the tip of the tongue. The applicator is stiff, I don't care for. I have pigmented lips, the shade *Mauve shows soft, baby pink on me. I wouldn't mind other shades.  I love it! The color is a pinky mauve on my skin tone. It is creamy rich without the gloss nor is it sticky which is what I don't like.  I absolutely love this, as the other review says, if your lips are dry, exfoliate before wearing.  the shade divine is the besttttt !"

154,154,uoma beauty,badass icon matte lipstick,pimprod2006202,2545792,"  I put this on once in the morning and it lasts throughout my work day. I'm a teacher so i'm constantly talking all day! It also lasts through most of my lunches with no reapplying!
It's also comfortable‚ÄîMUCH more comfy than a liquid matte for sure! I don't feel it on my lips after i put it on and blot in the morning. I blot because it is really creamy on the lips so it will transfer in the beginning. After blotting, it's little to no transfer!

The only con is I bought multiple at once (when on sale) and the packaging looks the same. The sticker doesn't show what color so I have to open them all until i memorized the color names.

Waiting for the next sale to buy more!
If you are looking for mattes, this is your best option (:  Bold color lasts all day (even through lunch) with being drying! Very comfortable‚Äîcoming from a lipstick fiend, this might be one of the best formulas out there, hands down.
After application, wait a little bit, then blot and you are good for the next 8+ hours!

The only con i can think of is that most of the ones I own actually broke off in the container. But it's still usable, just an fyi to, i guess, be careful with application.  Doesn't make your lips feel dry or stiff like other matte lipsticks. I really enjoy this product!  I love the lipsticks more because one of the shades has my name. They break I have purchased the same shade twice both times the lipstick broke. IM SORRY BUT DO NOT BUY  The colors are so beautiful. I bought Nina and Aretha. I'd buy more, if they didn't break so easily  The product was OK.  Nothing special My issues was out of the 10 tubes I bought during the last sale?  I had to return 5 because they were broken at the base.  They also stained my lips which I didn't care for  I have two of these. In Coretta and Katheleen. The formula is satin smooth, not drying, and doesn't accentuate lip lines, also the colors i have don't bleed. I have no problems with them breaking, but I don't expose the full bullet when putting on lipstick. One thing to note, the colors in real life on the lips are a bit off from what is online. I found that for both of these. Coretta is a lot deeper than pictured and Kathleen is more earth light peachy brown toned. Also, the formula is  great to use as a blush!"
155,155,essence,electric glow color changing lipstick,pimprod2033196,2597558,"  It looks so pink and natural, and had a nice scent!  Packaging is beautiful, color is fabulous! Went in to the store trying to get a nice lip tint since my original one (dif product) took a field trip through the washer and was unusable after :( gotta say I'm loving this one! Will def buy again.  i love the natural pink tint. goes on smooth and keeps the lips moisturizing all day but once some of the product gets into your mouth, it gives you a weird bitter taste.  Looks pretty...changes lip color...but unfortunately this product does smells of gasoline as I read in another review...  Definitely a DUPE to the MILANI Hemp  lip balm one!  so cool but drying. just use w a chapstick or gloss  Pretty to look at. Packaging is nice. Tastes awful. Cant wait to wipe it off as soon as I apply it. Wouldnt buy again based on the taste."
156,156,lime crime,soft touch lipstick,pimprod2031167,2595144,"  Glides on smooth. Doesn't dry lips out and color lasts.  The colors aren't bold enough. The texture is pretty good but the color is so thinly colored.  The packaging is so cute.I purchased Violet Vibes.  Loved the look of this lipstick.  The color payoff was okay, you definitely had to build it up, as it's not a one swipe formula.  It felt comfortable on my lips.  It's unfortunate that the bullet broke in 3 uses.  I did not wind the bullet up high, and it wasn't hot when I using it.  I guess the quality just wasn't there. This lipstick was decluttered within a month of purchase.It's just too bad, since I loved the formula of their Unicorn Lipstick series.  I have the shades mauve motel and vintage spice and I absolutely love the colors. They're very comfortable to wear and apply evenly. I also feel like they last a pretty long time even through drinking and snacking at work. I really like the paper tube too!  I own Radical Red (blue-toned red), Fuchsia Flare (bright pink, and Stellar Pink (light pinky beige). Stellar Pink is perfect for low-key or minimal makeup days for me. I like Fuchsia Flare for bright and light looks. I love Radical Red for a classic statement lip. I find the formula very comfortable on me. I always outline my lips with a lip pencil and find that this wears well throughout the day. I love the soft vanilla mint scent. This formula does not slip and slide around or come off easily on my teeth. It does a good job of softly blurring my lip lines. Also, this formula doesn't dry out my lips! I wish there was a wider color range with more unusual colors like a midtone light purple, a black, a deep teal blue, and a slightly deeper than midtone lime green.  I'm a lipstick girl. I love lipstick. I wear it every day. I was looking for a peach color for the summer when I stumbled upon this one from Lime crime. I was so excited to wear it! I hate to say this, but this is probably the worst formula I have ever encountered! It's patchy, streaky, does not stay on, and looks plain awful! It's too bad because the color is gorgeous. I just can't seem to get it to work for me. Save your money! I don't think I'll be buying anything from Lime Crime again.  Hated having this on my lips and plan to return. Color payoff is poor and the worst part is the feeling of having clay/dirt/etc. in my teeth after applying. As for longevity I'd give it a half star if possible - wore off super quickly. All-around fail for me."
157,157,milani,color fetish balm lipstick,pimprod2021061,2573965,"  Love the color. Love that it stays on all day! Definitely need to use make up remover to take it off at night as it stays on and on!!!  Love the case.  I got the color covet on clearance. I don't know if it was a bad or old batch or what, because it felt exactly like wiping sand on my lips and was the most horrible feeling thing I've ever put on. I will be returning it and will never purchase these again.  Nylon (top pics, with a little brown liner) and Lingerie (bottom pics) in 2 different lighting on my olive-warm skin. Love this product, underrated. Balm-lipstick indeed. Color is true on website, but my lips tend to be semi-pale except for top lip.  This lipstick felt horrible. It has a sandpaper feel on my lips.  I love these balms! Very hydrating with lots of pigment. Fantastic colors!  Love this lipstick! It's my favorite! It's perfect for everyday wear. It's easy to wear and not drying at all. You will need to reapply after eating. Also, the Lingerie color is like your lip color but better!  Some Nyx lip products irritate, too."

I received my order and 3 out of 4 lip products were bad so I'm going to have to return them. The problem with this lipstick is it turns bad quickly. The colors are beautiful and the lipstick is cheap but sometimes you get what you pay for.  Its a great product and goes well with the megaslicks lip gloss.

Turn the bottom and the lipstick comes up. Nice purchase  So pretty and easy to use  It took me a minute to figure it out, since mine arrived jammed. After a quick search, I found the answer! I threw it on the padded carpet pretty hard and it popped apart, but is completely undamaged. Popped in the refill and we're good to go!  I love this idea of a reusable lipstick case! I already own a few other Fenty Icon cases but I needed it in red! The case itself has a nice glossy shine to it and is easy to use. Just don't be like me and get the bullet stuck inside it was a hassle to get it out but it was my fault for accidentally pushing it in before I inserted the lipstick lol!!"

Needless to say, I will be purchasing more designs/color ways now that Ulta's released more offerings than before ü•∞  Bought this product and ruined my new lipstick by trying to get it to fit. It does not fit my velvet lipstick at all. Will be returning fo store.  I would not have bought this but I just LOVE the Addict lipstick.. I ended up purchasing multiple shades so the case helps me tell them apart!  I absolutely love the pink case but of course the case means nothing if you don't love the lipstick‚Äî omg I love that lipstick!! All time favorite lipstick and I hope they never stop making this lipstick!!  PS besides the pink cannage I did but the floral case too which I got from the Dior site.  Both the pink and floral are beautiful!  Dior should make a refillable powder compact in this pink cannage!! Please!!!!!!!"

It blends well its pigmented and super hydrating on the lips. They blend super well and its bieginer friendly  I love blush, but cream blushes can be a hit or miss so I didn't really like to use them too much. However, this formula is so different and it's so pigmented. The colors are creamy but not oily, they go on smooth and look beautiful on the skin. I've used them alone and also layered them and they look fantastic.  Don't let the Barbie Pink look scare you away! This Lip and Cheek Cream blends out to a beautiful gorgeous flushed Glow! A little goes a long way too!  I love that you can use these on your cheeks & lips! Such beautiful colors.  Yes! You should try this cream blush. It's so pigmented though so start light handed. Blend out so beautifully and dries down soft to the touch. I wish there were more colors."

I've come to realize that some lipsticks are worth the high price tag. This one is a definite rebuy! Beautiful color and texture. Leaves the lips soft and moisturized. I love this one and the liquid version of it. Also smells amazing.  I absolutely love this color. It  feels amazing on. It is one that has to be replied.  I will diffently buy again.  I thought i knew good lipstick when i bought multiple shades of Dior Addict!  This is the best lipstick formula i have ever used and the color is gorgeous-i love it so much ive bought backups plus another shade from I Need a Nude lipstick and bought all 3 shades from I Need a Rpse lipstick‚Äî theu are all so beautiful!  I leave my house with confidence every day!  Perfection!  This is the most gorgeous lipstick ever! I use it every single weekend out. Its my go to and I never want to run out!

I believe myth was discontuned and peach blossom and cherish are hard to find. I would stock up. I'm devadtated that myth is no more.  Did not stay on 8 minutes let alone 8 hours  This lipstick is beautiful it feel very smooth pn my lips and it isn't really dark. It blends out so beautiful, shiny or you can dull it down a bit with tapping motions with your finger. I am on my way to buying more!!  I absolutely love this lipstick.. the color , a warm brick red, was recommended by the sales associate, Sydney.. and I am quite pleased with the shade, and ease of application!  If you want. 10/10 lipstick then buy it.  I have been wearing this color for many years  This lip color was more solid than with a pearl finish and darker once applied than expected."

It is very drying to my lips to I do not use often but that is to be expected from a mat lip product. I like the coverage and color quality  Got ""Strong"" and finally found the mauve I've been looking for! went back and got ""Persistent, and Bossy"" love them all!!  Formula is great. not sticky or with perfum.  I love how light this lip cr√®me feels on my lips. The color: Persistent, is deep and rich looking.  I love the color  This lip creme has great color and is very vibrant when first applied. I applied it without any sort of primer and it lasts a few hours if I'm careful. I purchased ""Persistent"" which is a cool red. The color  transferred so easily to every napkin or glass but it still looked fine, again only if I'm careful. It's a matte lip cream but it didn't make my lips dry.  I have never tried anything from this brand and I decided to try this one because I really liked the color. The formula for very nice, not sticky or drying. I've liked just dabbing it on and it looks like a lip tint. I will be buying more colors."

Because this is few costly  Its hard to find cream blush these days I've noticed, especially affordable! I love this stick tbh. Its dewy, buildable and blends well. I use it on my cheeks and nose, sometimes my lips! sturdy packaging, a lot of product. Downside is, like many cream blushes, it can wear off throughout the day. still lovely!  I love this blush got it in the color ready of not. Its great dir a clean girl look ir a full glam. Super affordable price. If you want a easy makeup look this us the product for you 10/10  As someone with a medium-deep skintone I find that these are very sheer. I got what seems to be the darkest shade 'superfreak' and the pink shade 'heartbreaker'. I find the red to be quite sheer and looks more like a deep berry than a red. The pink has a whitish undertone on me so I use it on my lips. I like them a bit better on the lips. They're not sticky although they don't dry down all the way. It's a actually a pretty flush of color on the cheeks, just very sheer that I have to build it up a lot. I actually used the pink all over the cheeks and covered it up with foundation and it gave me a very pretty glow. I found a way to use these, but I wouldn't buy another one. I much prefer the original Playdate blush sticks over these ones.  its pretty small but i find that the brighter shades go a long way. the packaging is so adorable and i looooove the subtle glowy finish. go to blush for summer this year!  It doesn't have any pigments at all."
169,169,flower beauty,perfect pout soft matte lip color,pimprod2032411,2597112,"  The feel of this product is nice, but I purchased the color Punch and it bled way too much for my liking. Even with a liner, it spread like a wildfire all around my lip line. I'd recommend getting a shade on the nude side if you want to try this. Punch is a beautiful color but just doesn't work for me.  Wow, this lip product is amazing. It's a matte but doesn't look dry. Makes my lips look pillowy. Softens the little lines in my lips and makes it look like I got them done (subtle and beautiful).  I'm so picky when it comes to my lips, I hate the feeling of matte lipstick, but this doesn't bother me! I love the color (blush) so much! I want more colors!  Doesn't flake and feels like you're wearing nothing. Other ones I've tried flake or just feel terrible in general. LOVE IT SO MUCH. IT'S ALL I WEAR BOW. Dune is a great everyday nude color just bought more colors!  This lipstick is like its almost moisturizing as its also matte. Lovely formula very different from anything else ive tried. Not drying and almost forget its even on. At first it very wet/moosey texture but turns dry after a min and dries beautifully. I lole to use my finger to blend in. I got the color Dune and its a beautiful cool toned niude love this packaging too.  First of all, this product feels really nice on the lips. When i first swiped it, i originally thought it was going to stay wet but after a few minutes, it dried matte (but not flaky or dry patched). The color is pretty, i ordered Blush, but i wish it was true to what's pictured. It looks like a nude pink in the photo but in real life, it's more of a mauve and that doesn't pair so well with my skin tone:( (for reference, i have light medium skin with a yellow undertone). Will definitely try another color!  i bought this in the shade ""blush"" and immediately i want to buy all the other colors. this is the most comfortable lip product i've worn. i also don't have to worry about it getting in my teeth. i wish this came in more colors!"

I am shade 135 MORE for the WYN Foundation and I love how the lipstick shades ASK and ANNOUNCE look on me. The lipstick also goes on so nicely and it is not drying at all!! It lasts long as well and the shades are just beautiful. I'm obsessed!  Lots of pigment but still feels light on the lips. Doesnt transfer much but it is matte - so it can dry out the lips.  I liked the formula of this lipstick . It is a long wearing lipstick and highly pigmented.  I love this featherweight lip color. I bought speak   It is a perfect everyday shade for me. It lasts for hours. Plan to try more colors from Wyn. I love the packaging as well.  I can never seem to find a good shade of lipstick but I love the shades of this lightweight lipstick by Wyn! I bought two, one neutral and one bright shade. The formula is more matte, and is a little transferable. The smaller tube size is convenient for more controlled application and travels well.  Wow! I love this lipstick. It's matte, but not overly drying and it's lasting on my lips longer than most matte lipsticks. I LOVE lipstick and this is one of the best formulas that I've tried!  I purchased the color called SHOUT, and it is the prettiest vibrant shade of fuchsia! Good coverage and long lasting too. I spent over $36 and also received the free make up bag. It is quality and roomy. I love the clever concept of the tennis ball green color for Serena's products, so cute!"
171,171,natasha denona,i need a rose lipstick,pimprod2038011,2606665,"  That lipstick is so so pretty!! I found it very hard to find a cool pink shade that is not too nude or brown and this one is just perfect!!

It also feels very comfortable on the lips, very smooth and butter like!! The pigmentation is absolutely lovely and it lasts hours!! 

I just wish it was coming in a little kit with a mini lip liner!!"
172,172,r.e.m. beauty,on your collar classic lipstick,pimprod2033250,2596783,"  Such a bold red! It was so easy to put on and evenly apply on my lips.  First off‚Ä¶ WOW! If you're familiar with Hourglass Phantom Volumizing Glossy Lip Balm - its so similar, minus the gloss. Incredible application- buttery and smooth. It has a sexy delicious vanilla scent, which I LOVE!!! The packaging is so cute and I love the magnetic case! Its also so long lasting!!  Seriously 10/10 for this, well done R.E.M Beauty!  i bought this lipstick in JULY. it is now december and it still has SO MUCH. ive been using it daily and it literally only requires 2 swipes to show the color. it blends so beautifully into my lip liner!! i top it off with the rem beuaty plumpling lip gloss and it lasts the entire day, i mean it. no reapplies needed. i recommend this SO MUCH.  I bought this a few days ago and finally gave it a try.  I must say i was fully impressed not only by the packaging of the lipstick itself but also the color.  It glides so smoothly across the lips.  Definitely recommend!!!!  This lipstick has beautiful pigmentation, but it is a tad bit drying. Lasts fairly well. My issue is that it is .02oz of product (not .12oz as the Ulta site/app indicates), so it is essentially the same size as a lip liner (or in many cases, half as much as a lip liner). That's just insane. I know there are high-end lip liners out there, but even with those, you're getting .04g on average.
The math just ain't mathing on this one.  Although I like the colors I chose, the product is a little thick for my liking. Nothing wrong with the product itself, and I generally like REM, but I'm not a fan of the thickness/texture.  Although I like the colors I chose, the product is a little thick for my liking.

174,174,j.cat beauty,amazeme tinted lip crayon,pimprod2038613,2610107,"  Got this on sale just to meet the min for free shipping and actually super impressed! I'm light w yellow undertones and went with the Hey Babe! color. Surprised w how pigmented it is. I outline and dab and blend to a pretty orange pink hue. Its semi-matte so will put a dab of gloss over the light points. Would recommend this one  Just the way you are is a beautiful shade in this line. I sometimes mix it with another lip product (or more than one) and the colors have been beautiful. This tinted lip crayon hasn't been drying and there is no extra scent nor fragrance besides the ingredients, which is what I prefer as sometimes a fragrance can be very strong in makeup products/cause skin sensitization. I did look at their website for more photos/swatches which is how I chose the colors I bought (only have used one so far though). Overall, a great product with  good ingredients, too!  I bought this lipcolor in ""Hey Babe"" hoping it was a true orange like in the pic.  It's nothing like it, I would say it's more of a reddish color and I also didn't like the semi-matte look on my lips.  Sorry, had to return.  Opened the lif of the lipstick crayon and the entire lipstick was out of the the crayon applicator and tip of crayon was smashed into the lid. Im going to assume heat during delivery (Texas) played a part as well as the box of the lipstick was tip side down in the mailer. Unfortunate, made a huge mess trying to temive the lipstick and place into the proper part if the applicator. The lipstick was very creamy all iver my fingers and under my fingernails, but this shade is described as dusty purple and i find this to be a dusty pink or dusty rose, no violet component in my opinion.  I purchased this during a recent sale. I got the shade hey babe(true orange). this is felt amazing on my lips. the color paynoff was perfect. it does wipe off completely when eating. nonetheless it's worth it. I want the cherry red color next.  I bought this kind of as an afterthought and am happy with it! The shade ""Take a Chance"" is a lovely berry-blue-red, really pigmented, and wears well. It can dry the lips out a bit, but I top it with some chapstick or Vaseline."
175,175,clinique,pop reds,pimprod2026793,2567335,"  Must buy! I love clinique pop red! I use it almost daily!!  This product came up when I filtered my search results for a lip color product with a glossy finish.  I'm not sure if this is an Ulta issue or a Clinique issue, but it is definitely NOT glossy.  I bought the shade ""Roses Are Red"" and it's the perfect shade for me. It has a teensy bit of a pink in it and I think that's what I was missing in other reds I've tried. Most were too orange, too bright, too blood red looking. I LOVE this shade and now I want to wear it every day. 
I prep my lips with MAC Prep & Prime then line them with my Clinique red lip liner, and then apply the lipstick. Wait a few minutes and add another layer of lipstick, and it literally lasts until you take it off. I wore it to a party the other night and it lasted through dinner & drinks and still looked amazing. This is the perfect formula of matte color without being drying. Thanks Clinique.  I will definitely buy this product again.  I will recommend it to a friend.  I used to use it in the past and now I have come full circle back to it.  I have medium skin and it works. I love the color.  I have medium fair neutral skin, and dark brown hair eyes. I also have asthma and allergies, so I'll touch base on how it smells in addition to how it looks. 

I was looking for a true vintage red and used the ""try me"" feature to pick out Red Handed. It just arrived, and the color is exactly what I was looking for. It's true to what the Try Me feature showed.

This lipstick is very rich and pigmented, so it goes on solid red instead of being faded looking and needing to be built up (looking at you, drugstore lipstick). It feels creamy and moisturizing, not like my lips are going to start peeling any second.

Now for the scent. It doesn't smell like a crayon, and in fact as far as I can tell, it is completely, 100 percent, unscented. Zero smell, none at all that I can pick up on, and I have a nose like a shark. There's no mystery wheezing either, so no fumes irritating my lungs. I officially love Clinique. 17/10 would buy again.  I'm a faithful Clinique lipstick fan for many years.  This time, before application, I needed to use Chapstick, then lipstick, followed by a lip gloss.  Won't return because of beautiful shade of red.  Wasn't the right color for me. Was expecting more chocolate in the color."

It's the perfect touch of color - Like you just got in from a brisk walk. (For reference, i have light neutral / 2N skin with freckles.)  I'm not the person who uses make up every day, so I don't buy a lot of it.
This pot is the most versatile one, I use it as blush, eye shadow and lipstick. The texture is nice, gives you the right glow without overdoing it. 
I have the foundation, concealer and lipstick from this brand and when use them, people tell me my skin looks so healthy and with a natural glow.  My skin reacted so poorly to this. It took a couple days of using before I realized that the sudden onset of acne was due to this product. As soon as I stopped using, my face finally started clearing up. Unfortunate"

Long lasting and doesn't dry my lips out!!  I picked up the ""Perfect Red"" because it looked perfect in photo. Exact color I wanted on my lips. There was no swatch photo and I couldn't find anything online, so I decided to just give it a try. Maybe it will work out. I was wrong! The actual color on lips looks nothing like the photo, like the lipstick itself and I'm now so disapointed. It looks more dark pink than red, so horrible on me. I want to attach photos but there is no option to do so.  I have been searching for a solid duplicate for maybelline's 14 hour matte wear ""continuous cranberry"" since 2014. They abruptly discontinued it and ive had the hardest time finding a solid blue-toned red. I've probably spent around $500 over the past decade only to be disappointed over and over again. 

‚Ä¶But not this time

This lip color looks fantastic on skin with yellow undertones. It doesnt look brown in florescent lighting. It feels like I'm wearing a satin finish lipstick. There is some slight feathering but that's easily fixed. I'm in love! A true true blue red that lasts all day long! I cried a little when i matched it up with my old swatched lip color. Absolute perfection! If its out of stock, its because I bought it all  This red is a vibrant color and  I love the pigment of this brand. I absolutely love the tube the lipstick is in , so pretty!!  this lipstick is buttery and beautiful on every complexion.  I Got color Drama Queen and let me tell you it's such a beautiful color. I got it for my mom and she loves that it's matte but creamy at the same time. the only bad thing is that it's not that Transfer proof so yes you have to reapply after eating something.  i love this! would buy again, not overly drying, and lasts a long time on lips"

181,181,j.cat beauty,scene stealer ultra creamy lipstick,pimprod2002011,2540802,"  I got this lipstick in Midnight Run (metallic black) and Midnight Swim (metallic blue). MR looks and smells good, but has a very bad taste. MS looks and smells good, tastes fine, but broke off of its component with minimal force. I think the colors and cost of this are great, and I'd definitely recommend this product. Not sure what the deal with the bad taste is though.  I bought this lipstick in the shades Midnight Run (black metallic) and Midnight Swim (blue metallic). MR is very pretty and has a slighty sweet scent, but tastes bitter and bad on the lips. MS has no bad taste, and looks beautiful. MS did break off the component with minimal force, though. For the price, though, performance is good and I can make do.  When I put this on there was an awful chemical taste from it. It is horrible and I will never wear it again!  The color is pretty, but that's where it stops. It has an strong smell and even stronger taste. It taste like a chalky vitamin or medicine. I puckered my lips and it got it my mouth I couldn't get to a wipe quick enough. Hard pass.  The colour is gorgeous, i really want to love this lipstick, but the things that hold it back are too important for me to recommend it. The lipstick itself is very soft, unfortunately this leads to the product bending in the tube and making a mess, the taste is also disgusting. When making a product that's applied to the mouth it's generally a good idea to not make it taste so unappealing.  Love the colors of all three, but when I put it on my lips sorta burned and the taste was so bad, my husband kissed me and told me to take that nasty tasting lipstick off., unfortunately I threw the package away before I tried them or I would be taking these back..  The shades are lovely, and I plan on buying more (though Smooth Criminal is a loud peachy-pink, I'm sure I can make it work). I have several shades, mostly the metallics, and they go on smoothly, saturate well, and don't sink into lip lines too much (a frequent problem with other metallics). Unfortunately, as some have said, at least two of the shades (Hidden Target and Midnight Run, in my case) have a terrible taste. Almost as if a bittering agent was added to the formula. None of the other shades I bought (Whisper, Smooth Criminal, Letter From You, Midnight Swim, Double Cross, Secret Mood) had that taste, and they tasted like almost nothing. What I did notice about the bad-tasting shades is that they dragged on more, didn't have as smooth of an application as the others. I also felt a slight tingling in my lips. I've found this is common in other lipsticks when they've gone bad. Could the bad-tasting lipsticks be from bad batches? Are only certain shades affected? I might just buy more to test my hypothesis. But if you get a nasty-tasting shade, I recommend exchanging it for a different one."
182,182,burt's bees,matte stick lipstick,pimprod2008694,2553504,"  I love this lipstick! Not only does it last a long time, the colors are beautiful. I started with 2 & now I own multiples of all the colors cause I literally store them everywhere! I have other colors expensive matte lipsticks & this beats them by far. They start out sheer & you can build the intensity to whatever you're feeling that day. Would highly recommend.  I am a person that always ends up with lipstick on my teeth, no matter what.  Glosses always end up transferring.  This is a true matte and does not transfer on your teeth!  It is dry, if that's going to be a problem for you, find something else.  Colors seem to be a little lighter than what they look in these online pictures.  I would like to see Ulta add photos of this lipstick on different models.  I was so excited when I saw that Burt's bees has lipstick and I love the shade liquid honey, it's a adorable brown nude more (more on the warm tone side red tintish but barely.) super easy to use and apply too! If it gets to cold and hardens up just rub the top of it on your skin to warm it up and it goes on. Perfect for all types of seasons  I have always been a big fan of Burts Bees so when I saw this I had to try it. It is very matte so I added a gloss over it and it looks great! The color is perfect and it wears well.  Perfect!  Only really settles into the grooves of my lips, giving an effect like chalk on pavement. Definitely a problem with pigment distribution as the balm itself does have a nice feel?  Very affordable dupe for the Violette Fr Bisou Balm. It feels very comfortable on my lips and I didn't experience any drying. The only thing I don't like is that it smells like a crayon. Liquid Ruby is a gorgeous color. It's very pigmented, so I just add a tiny bit and blend it out for a natural look. It's easy to build too! I would most likely buy this again over Bisou Balm because it's a fraction of the price."

184,184,wet n wild,soft blur matte lipstick,pimprod2043780,2620872,"  I really like this lip product! It goes on with a velvet glide and has a very soft summer scent. What i dont love is how the plastic tube feels bery cheap - but for under $5 what did I expect?! Overall all I'm happy with my purchase and will be buying more colors soon. :)  I really love these new lipsticks, I purchased I'm shy color and I wear almost everyday. I hope they will add more colors to the line or at least add a soft pink color.  The colors on here look totally different in person so I recommend looking up swatches online. The color is soft and doesn't emphasize texture. They look matte but are similar in feel to a balm. I think they are comparable to the nars matte tinted balms. The formula is lovely. I will say the packaging is cheap and i had to kind of press the liistick into the holder because it loosened during shipping. Ordering the rest of the shades now!  I got the colors im shy and homecoming queen. The pictures depict both as being warm toned and deeper brown/red colors. Both colors in person are completely not what expedted. Homecoming queen is loke a bright rasberry shade whereas im shy is a corally shade. I like the feel of the lipsticks though but dont expect the colors to be what you think they are as displayed online!  I have been waiting to get my hands on these since I first heard about them! After wearing them for a few weeks, I've come to love this product a lot. The red shade I purchased looks great on my lips, a soft and blurred look that is silky and confortable on the lips. It smells very pleasantly of vanilla and fades gracefully. The only caveat is that the packaging is bad. I only had it my bag for one day before the product broke off and was hitting the top of the plastic cap. I don't mind it THAT much but definitely need tk be careful not to pull the top off too hard or I'll end up losing the bullet of product."

It just a smooth velvet texture it glides on the lip. No dragging. I wouldn't give it 5 stars but 4 stars for the texture and creme feel. Doesn't dry down perfectly so there is transfer doesn't hold up to a full meal but stays for drinking or snack. But hands down perfect matte creme lipstick. Pairs with awesome with its counterpart lip liner. Can't wait to try more colors  THE COLORS. You can't find the lightest shade anywhere else. It's the lightest lip shade I've ever tried that's ACTUALLY pink. This is a holy grail for our redhead/ albino/ other pale girls.

It will get on everything. Cups, straws, and unless you're careful, your teeth. But it's showstoppingly beautiful. The richest, shiniest red you've ever seen. It's picky, it's pricey, but it's so gorgeous you love it anyway.  I wanted to love the Emilia shade. The swatches show that its such a darker red. But in person and on lips theres only a subtle difference. Was really hoping Emilia would be as dark as the swatches.  I am not a red Lippie girl. But this right here has converted me. She's is beautiful!!! I have Emilia and I have the liner duo. She does not fail me. I like to line my lips with a little brown as well to match my natural lip contour. She is pigmented too! I lov ittttt  I love it. I just fell in love with that. I love how it looks on. I love the shape of it. I love the smell of it. I love how it looks on my skin complexion. I just love it. Absolutely love it. I got it in the color Emilia just stunning.  This lipstick is exactly as advertised. I made the mistake of assuming it was transfer proof because the lip liner twin is transfer proof. Unfortunately, it is not transfer proof, so I am returning it. But this lipstick is exactly what it says it is and the color is amazing. Ôøº"
189,189,revlon,super lustrous lipstick the luscious mattes,pimprod2012214,2557931,"  I have this lipstick in the shade Shameless and it is one of my favorite formulas. It is a creamy lightweight matte with a lot of pigment. In terms of formula, it competes with more high end brands. It most closely resembles (IMO) the bareMinerals BarePro Longwear lipstick formula (in the thin tube). I loved that formula! In terms of the color, I'd describe  it as a terracotta nude rose - on my light olive skin it definitely is warm, so I don't like to wear it opaquely, but a light application is beautiful. It's very nuanced for a drugstore shade. I haven't explored any of the other colors, but would love to.  I'm taking time out my day to say buy it.  Buy it. It is so buttery soft smooth, feel great on the lips. It is Not* transfer proof. But I do not care, for this pigment and moisture it is worth a reapply or two during the night.  While it's plush and matte, the color is 1,000% other than what is pictured. On my monitor, Wild Thoughts is a cool light-ish mauve with a touch of shimmer, even when shown on non-models in blogs and photos on the internet. However, this color is actually a muted hibiscus pink bordering on red. There is zero shimmer as well. Be warned. The color shown is NOT what you will receive. What you get is a fairly intense medium pink and not what I wanted.  I bought this for the pillow talk dupe and let me tell you I love this beautiful color! Stays on beautifully even after drinking and eating. Just a little swipe of plain gloss brings the color back out. I absolutely love this lipstick. I bought the shade Pick me up.  omg the ""pick me up"", shade 003, is the exact same shade as Charlotte Tilbury's ""pillow talk""  I got the color ""Moonlight"" because I wanted a solid grey lipstick, but the formula is extremely patchy and barely stays on my lips. Do not buy this lipstick if you want a long wear lipstick that has a solid application. The BRAND-NEW lipstick  also was not connected to the inside of the container and slid right out of the container. 

* bad pigment 
* horrible application 
* fell apart 
* dosen't last  I needed a matte lipstick that blends with my natural lip color and fits well with my skin tone and this is the one ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"

191,191,undone beauty,lip to cheek cream palette,pimprod2023501,2580766,"  love this cream blush and it's not expensive!! I'm usually not a cream makeup girl but this is good  I purchased several of these in different colors when they were on sale. Super easy to apply and blend. I've even mixed some of the colors together and that looks phenomenal too. I'm assuming the coconut oil, which makes it extremely easy to apply, is also why alone it doesn't last all day. However, if I use a primer, a little powder before and after applying, and a setting spray, I can get around 8 hours out of it. I'll throw one in my purse if I know I'll be out longer than that for a touch-up, which I do with my fingers. It doesn't take a lot of product and it is easily buildable. I just know if I'm going for a more no makeup day, I will be reapplying every couple of hours.  The creme blush is moist hence, you only need a small amount on cheeks and blend well.  Nice product.  I've not used on my lips.  best for the no makeup days and looks natural can be blended with fingers. easy to reapply :)  Got this in Bubble and Rosy and I really like it.  Seems to be better than the Morphe lip/cheek balms I picked up at the same time. This has much more intensity, even the sheer shades.  I just started using this brand and want to try more products. I also have the brow pen, and really like that, too.  I have tried quite a few blushes but this the most amazing one I've ever tried! I use shade bubble with all my makeup looks, I love that it always pairs flawlessly with any other products I've used. I have used this with foundation/full beat, alone with a complimentary lipgloss and it looks beautiful. I've had fails in the past with other brands cream blushes being patchy, but I've found this formula to be incredible- it's so smooth you can even layer it over powder! This is a forever repurchase for me, I'm definitely buying more shades and backups.  I'm pretty new to makeup, and I really wanted to try a cream blush. After searching for a while, I found this one! It's super pretty and I personally really like that there are three different coverage levels. As a lip product, it's okay, but I prefer more nourishing formulas for my lips. I got the shade Rosewood. I'm planning on maybe getting the shade Poppy next time!"
192,192,ere perez,coco crayon,pimprod2035873,2599776,"  Super smooth and easy to apply plus long lasting!  Lovely creamy texture, applies smoothly! Plus you are able to play with sheer to full coverage for lips and cheeks!  I'm a fan!!! These work as a liner or lipstick. The color payoff is fantastic. Can apply for full color or blot for a stain. Long lasting color without drying. I wish they had more colors.  I am in love with this product! I have a couple of shades and want them all now!  Super creamy, smooth to to apply and long lasting power. Love you can use it on cheeks and eyes too!  I love all the colors of this pencil, the ease of use, and smooth glide to use as an all purpose liner & color. However, the first pencil I've had to sharpen split in half over an inch deep when I first sharpened it. At least you get a lot of pencil with it, but the wood in the the pencil should not split like this. It's especially disappointing since the color stick on the interior is fairly soft and easily mangled by a sharpener. The sharpener I was using was brand new, too, so not like an issue of a dull sharpener.  Keep your epi pen ready for the red lake dyes they snuck in there! Ulta is horrendous when it comes to accurately listing ingredients.  Contains red lake dye!!! Sneaky trying to pass it off as natural."

This has beautiful colors, amazinf staying power, and most of all it isnt drying!! Feels smooth on my lips. I've had this for a year or so and feel the same way. But it you won't be dissapointed!  This feels so soft on my lips! I went outside for a walk in the snow and my lips don't feel dry and the color is still intact.  I am not one that owns or wears lipstick but I decided to give this product a try I bought beautiful, periodt and it's a pretty shade and I love the smell. I even showered afterwards with it still on and it didn't budge I defiantly need more shades.  I love the color, but I didn't get to ware it long at all it came off on everything.  I love this product so smooth and the tip helps you get a full lip look it's beautiful totally worth it!!!!  Texture and coverage üëåüèª  This is good liquid lipstick. It last along time and has good color. It is very drying, I need to exfoliate before and keep hydrating after."

I wanted to try this out so pirchased jtand was happy i did.  It blends beautifully and then can be used on my lips!!!  I bought the berry shade. It's very true to color. It goes on sheer but it's easy to add more to get the desired look. I think it's a great product for the price.  So first of all, this product is not at all bad in any way, just not my preference. I bought it thinking it was gonna be a nice glow bc i saw it had some shine to it and also needed a new cream blush. It blends well, but is kind of sheer so I didnt really like it because i prefer more pigment in my blushes. The shine also is just kind of offputting in my opinion because its more sparkles in it. Its cute however as an eyeshadow!  Its amazing and its the perfect color, its not too sheer and its bot to solid, it blends perfectly. My favorite shade is Soft Smile and Ive bought it twice already. Definitely one of my faves!  Very beautiful on the skin and lips , easy to blend and gorgeous color pay off will be purchasing more colors Only have used the berry wine colored one so far was very impressed."

Long lasting and doesn't dry my lips out!!  I picked up the ""Perfect Red"" because it looked perfect in photo. Exact color I wanted on my lips. There was no swatch photo and I couldn't find anything online, so I decided to just give it a try. Maybe it will work out. I was wrong! The actual color on lips looks nothing like the photo, like the lipstick itself and I'm now so disapointed. It looks more dark pink than red, so horrible on me. I want to attach photos but there is no option to do so.  I have been searching for a solid duplicate for maybelline's 14 hour matte wear ""continuous cranberry"" since 2014. They abruptly discontinued it and ive had the hardest time finding a solid blue-toned red. I've probably spent around $500 over the past decade only to be disappointed over and over again. 

‚Ä¶But not this time

This lip color looks fantastic on skin with yellow undertones. It doesnt look brown in florescent lighting. It feels like I'm wearing a satin finish lipstick. There is some slight feathering but that's easily fixed. I'm in love! A true true blue red that lasts all day long! I cried a little when i matched it up with my old swatched lip color. Absolute perfection! If its out of stock, its because I bought it all  This red is a vibrant color and  I love the pigment of this brand. I absolutely love the tube the lipstick is in , so pretty!!  this lipstick is buttery and beautiful on every complexion.  I Got color Drama Queen and let me tell you it's such a beautiful color. I got it for my mom and she loves that it's matte but creamy at the same time. the only bad thing is that it's not that Transfer proof so yes you have to reapply after eating something.  i love this! would buy again, not overly drying, and lasts a long time on lips"

197,197,winky lux,purrfect pout lipstick,pimprod2004299,2545295,"  I love this lipstick.  It's so smooth and moisturizing, like nothing I've used before.  The color payoff is also very good and I just like the silky feeling on my lips.  Got Purrincess and Pawsh and they're both quite noticeable especially with lip liner.  This is a lip product I've purchased for my mother, simply because berry tones are her favorite and she's obsessed with cats. It looks very similar to Black Honey in my opinion, but I wouldn't consider it a ""cheaper alternative"" since the pricing isn't THAT contrasting. Overall, it seems to be a very cute little product with a decent application!  I love this lipstick! I bought it in a whim and I'm delighted with it. Pawsh is the perfect pink color. It would look good on anyone.  Super cute, it's a pretty pink sheer lipstick. It really brings out the pink in your lips! It's super good as well! 10/10 recommend!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è  I bought the color ""Frisky"" (purple) and I thought it might be a intense purple but it wasn't. It's more a a berry moisturizing purple that works great for day/night. You can also make it more often intense or light. I will be purchasing more.  I purchased the color ""Pawsh"". It's a very pretty tinted lip balm, not so much lipstick. You can hardly tell it's on your lips and the color is very flattering.

I noticed after a few uses it started to melt a bit, causing the lipstick to move and hit the edges of the tube. It's not the cheapest product so it's a bit disappointing.  Expensive for what it does. It is basically a tinted lip balm."

200,200,nabla,matte pleasure lipstick,pimprod2038973,2610263,"  I have been looking to replace another pinky nude in a discontinued brand. The color in the photo and description is completely wrong for Eclipse Nude. This color is 100% a mauve and the color in the tube was so far off that when I opened it, I immediately thought I was sent the wrong color. Huge disappointment, I have so many mauve lipsticks now from trying to replace a pink nude, its ridiculous. I gave it an extra star just because the formula feels really nice, but I can't speak to how long it lasts because I doubt I will wear this color, it washes me out. I'm very fair skinned. If you are interested in purchasing this brand, I'd recommend going inside the store to test if possible."
201,201,hourglass,unlocked satin cr√É¬®me lipstick in red 0,pimprod2037359,2608033,"  This color of this red is similar to a brick red. It's warm-toned with just a hint of brown mixed into it. I think this tone of red would suit most skin tones and the brown undertone makes it more wearable than a lot of brighter reds on the market. I found the formula to be very creamy and wearable. My lips were very comfortable! The shine on this formula is beautiful, but it doesn't wear well when I eat and drink. The packing is beautiful and luxurious. I love the magnetic closure! This would make a great little gift for any woman. This product was received as a gift; all opinions are my own.  I loved this color! The pigment was amazing and left a gorgeous shine to my lips. I wore this to work and got so many compliments on it, not only was it an easy to apply lipstick but it also lasted a while as well!  Such a beautiful red lipstick! It's made even better with 100% vegan ingredients. The color is vivid and buildable. It works for any occasions. The texture is creamy and easy to apply. It's also very hydrating. I like to apply a thin layer of it with my daily look. [Gifted by Hourglass Cosmetics]  This was my first time trying out Hourglass Cosmetics and I am totally blown away by this lip product. It is absolutely beautiful - from the packaging, to the ingredients, to the application and wear time. It is long lasting and looks gorgeous. This was complimentary from Hourglass Cosmetics, but my review is 100% my own.  This was gifted by hourglass cosmetics. It makes the perfect the red lip! Love that this uses great ingredients and it is so moisturizing. This just glides on the lips and is so long lasting. It is unlike any other lipstick I've used previously, absolutely love it!  I really like this beautiful red lipstick. It applies really good and smooth. I love the color and texture. The packaging is very luxurious and nice. I'm a big fan of the product and brand. The lipstick is great. Gifted by Hourglass Cosmetics.  I love every bit of this beautiful lipstick. From formula, to feel to packing it is made to perfection. Very pigmented and true to color. It the right blend of Creamy & Satin. The color stays put more than my other satin cream formula lipsticks. I highly recommend it. This product was gifted to me by Hourglass in exchange for my honest opinion"

I have this in 2 shades and both are gorgeous on the lips. So velvety soft and lasts pretty well. I do have to reapply but not too much. Sometimes it seems a little drying after a while but it could just be my dry lips.  This does feel like velvet. Not greasy, not oily, smooth and silky. Easy to apply. Color is so flattering. This is a beautiful red that doesn't scream hey I'm wearing red lipstick. It doesn't move. I've worn it without lip liner without worry.  If you give it a minute or two to dry it won't transfer to your mask.  So creamy!!!!!!!  Bought the red velvet. I love how it feels and it wears away evenly. I have tried several matte lipsticks and it it seems once it start to wear away you can't reapply. This stayed on well and faded evenly to stain.  ok maybe I don't own this but I want thank Clarins for including showing their lip colors on actual lips! just a little shout out.  I loveeeee this product. It's feels so lightweight and resembles mousse. A little goes a long way and it lasts for hours."
205,205,uoma beauty,black magic hypnotic impact high shine lipstick,pimprod2027733,2545799,"  I got the savage color which is supposed to be a pinkish red; instead it is decidely coral. The finish is not glittery at all. I'm disappointed because it looks nothing like that swatch. The lipstick itself also broke and got ""melty"" fast, despite being stored at room temp.  

That said, the coral color is pretty and it's a beautiful glossy sheen that isn't sticky. The packaging is also nice.  This is the smoothest lip stick I have ever used!! And I wish it sparkled more I was looking for something more sparkly. But it definitely shines. Feel like lip bomb none drying like the rest of my lipsticks . I love it!!  Literally so beautiful and natural looking. Very moisturizing too.  I LOVE these. Most pigmented lip products have the tendency of cling to skin on my bottom lip. No matter how moisturized or exfoliated I will get uneven pigment saturation if I try using other products solo. With these I can just swipe and go, which makes it worth every penny for me. I will be buying every color.  Sheer and shimmery.  Classic staple that layers well and stands strong alone.  Statement color that is subtle.  I'm a super fan new to the brand.  The best in the price point and even higher priced lipsticks.  I ordered the metallic lipstick in the shade Allure but recieved the high shine lipstick in the same shade instead. It's a pretty color that I'll be keeping, but I'll be reordering it since I guess it was a shipping mistake?  The shine of this color lasts all day for me"
206,206,ulta beauty collection,lip lacquer high shine liquid lipstick,pimprod2045979,2618040,"  Same color as my natural lip  I've been searching for a gloss that has some staying power. I absolutely love Bobbi Brown, and although it's better than many other glosses, it doesn't have a lot of staying power. I purchased this product in the Va-Va Voom Ouh La-La! and it didn't disappoint!! I suggest blotting with a paper towel between your lips. This will keep it off your teeth. I went to a black tie event last night, ate several apps and drank several drinks. Yes it did transfer to the glasses BUT when I left at the end of the night, about 5 hours later, I still had color that looked fresh-not as glossy and vibrant but still good. My husband was pretty impressed.  Granted it's red so the pigment is much stronger but still, WOW. Another observation, it will run to the corners of your mouth if it's applied too thick so be careful in that area. Also, I have dry lips so I hate those lip colors that are stay all day because they're too drying for me. This is not that type of product. It is glossy, hence the name lacquer, so expect shine. I liked it so much, I'm going to try another color soon.  I love the shine and feel. I just wish it stayed on longer. It does stay on more than other brands I've tried ‚Ä¶ just not all day.  Im so devastated! They changed the formula and these used to be my go to FOR YEAR! These do not stick at all and it's impossible to even get product out of the bottle. Please bring the old ones back!  I was using their previous liquid lipstick that got discontinued and I was DEVASTED! But I picked this one up the other day and I love it just as much! It's a liquid lipstick, that's not dry and shiny with the perfect amount of color! You don't need a lip liner with this! Gonna pick up more colors. Can't go wrong with ultras lip laquers! So in love  I chose red, it covers well, shines, color says Christmas party on my lips‚ùóÔ∏è  Did not glide on."

This lip stain stayed in place pretty well. It did start to rub off when I was drinking, but otherwise, it was a great matte lip stick.  The lipstick comes off on everything I eat and drink. I will not purchase again.  I have been using this liquid lipstick for almost the past 10 years. I still have a lot the discontinued colors as well. No other lipstick compares to this one in my opinion. I just purchased Ruby Phew and it is now my absolute perfect red!! I have Feels so Grand and Dance with me as well. I apply a clear chapstick and apply lip liner all over my lips before applying. It lasts me an entire day, 12+ hours, even after eating and drinking, maybe even kissing lol. 10/10 recommend!!  Would not buy again. Although I'm a fan of Mac products, this lipstick was a little too dry.  I was searching for the best red, and normally go for blue reds.

209,209,juvia's place,bronzed mini liquid lipstick,pimprod2025282,2583497,"  Bronzed Toast is not nearly as dark as the photo online, its a light brown, Bronzed Chestnut is the darkest one. The lipstick is tiny for the price, the applicator is too big and its very messy trying to get the lipstick on. The formula itself is very dry and flaky. Too bad this is the only super dark brown lipstick I can find.  It seems to be a great product, however the lip gloss was opened and I had to toss it.  The color looks nothing like the pic. It's not a bronzed toast, it looks more like the color of coffee with cream. It's just a completely different color.  I ordered bronze toast because i loved how dark it appeared online. However, the color ow completely off. I thoght maybe i was semt tjr wrong one. But the package and label us correct. The colir us more of milk chocolate color. Its not what i eas expecting.  I only received part of my order, twice. I had ordered bronzed maple but received  bronzed chestnut. the color in the bottle was pretty, a brick red terracotta orangey, but on my skin it's almost black. there are 3 shades available at this time of my purchase and review  with bronzed chestnut looking like the lightest shade. none of them look black. I also bought the shade clay, one of the nubian earth velvety matte bullet lipsticks which I had thought would be a lot darker than it is, but is more similar to the pictures of bronzed chestnut. this one is darker and the other lipstick is a lot lighter. maybe this is why they were on sale, errors in packaging the correct shades. it is still a pretty color, kind of a unique shade, just not on my tiny frog lips with pale skin. (dark lipstick colors make lips look really small and I see that.  Although the color and pigmentation is great, the lipstick does transfer and smudge. The finish is matte but slightly tacky. After wearing it for only 3 hours and drinking 1 cup of coffee, it starting lifting and creasing.  I ended up returning it.  The color is rich and covers well"

It wears really well.  I really want to support a black owned business and like this product. Unfortunately, the matte lipstick does not last awhile and the second date after purchasing, the lipstick cap came off and is not functioning properly. Not quality.  I love the color selection--all beautiful colors. And application is nice. My problem with this liquid lipstick is the stickiness!! Even after it dries down, it feels sticky on the lips.  I purchased this thinking it would seal the deal and it did not. I was truly hoping that it was non transferable like it was advised in the store. However that was not the case, it was all over the coffee cup after I already had the lipstick on for an hour or more. In addition I will say the color ""Chick Mauve""I purchased is really cute.  This is not extremely matte which is nice but it transfers especially when you start eating and it doesn't have an opaque color pay off it just feels really sticky even after drying I get dog hair on my lips somehow... kinda annoyed I bought this.  Love it! A comfortable matte on the lips and lasts all day, I'll be picking up more shades."

I bought another one because of how much I loved it!  Used the strawberry lip balm for a couple weeks and it resulted in the worst, dryest, cracked lips I have ever had. I usually use Dionni's goat milk balm but decided ti try something new based on its cute packaging, and I regret that. Maybe it has worked for others, but definitely not for me  A little bit makes your lips pop, good for a subtle soft girl look. I wear this everyday and my lips feel amazing.

Well, they leave my lips drier, and are more like lip tints than lip colors. They don't really blend smoothly like lipsticks, they're more like stain powders. They also taste sweet, which the cle ones don't. Comparing the ingredients of both, the cle ones have more moisturizing ingredients like vitamin e, niacinamide, and glycerin.

The transparent purple gives a pink tint to lips. The bold pink and bright red are matte texture (after some time of wearing) and held up pretty good! I wish they had more crazy colors.  Beautiful lipsticks"
218,218,hynt beauty,aria pure lipstick,pimprod2014346,2564457,"  Got the Tierra Blush.  It is very hard to find a lipstick with non-irritating ingredients.  I have very sensitive skin and have tried many.  I use the skin safe web site to check and see what they contain now.  This one is very pure.  I have light brownish/blonde hair and blue eyes with neutral skin, and got the Tierra Blush.  It looks like a good neutral on me, with a little more brown than I like.  I prefer more pink. It does look natural and probably would on a lot of people.  The one downside is that it is not a firm lipstick at all, it is almost ""mushy"" so goes on a bit thick from the tube and I need to blot it with a tissue.  We live in a southern location but I am in the AC all day so this really should not be happening!  On the pro side, it is very moisturizing and feels super nice on.  I do wish it could be slightly cheaper, if they got rid of the tiny mirror and the tiny lip balm, as I don't need those and won't be using them.  All in all, it's keeper but I would wish for a firmer texture and more pink.  I will be trying some of the other shades to get something pinker.  This shade looks like a good neutral for going to work everyday, especially in fall and winter.  This lipstick is hydrating; it goes on rich and buttery and absorbs/dries down to a creamy finish with a hint of sheen.  The shade pomegranate is gorgeous.  This lipstick transfers a little, but not as badly as I expected.  I have to reapply after eating; otherwise it lasts for several hours and wears down gracefully.  It has a sharp, bitter, unpleasant taste that lasts for hours after application.  I love everything else about it but will probably not repurchase for the taste alone.  I like the mirror and balm on top. Color was nice and stayed on longer than expected.  Product smelled as if it was old.  The Peonies Please adds such a nice pop of color! I like that this lipstick is spreadable so I can control the level of pigment I get. Very smooth and long lasting. I also have sensitive skin and this has worked for me.  Love this lipstick! It glides on so smoothly and the shade is perfect and would look great on anyone! I also love how the color can be both sheer and highly pigmented. So happy with this purchase!  Excellent color and build. Every color seems to be flattering!"
219,219,hourglass,girl lip stylo,pimprod2020461,2575711,"  I have this in the shades Peacemaker and Believer (medium nude and lighter nude). I've tried a million lip products and these have been some of my favorite go-tos since I first tried them. They aren't permanent, but they are extremely comfortable and non-fussy to reapply (at least in these shades, for sure!). I also really like that it seems to fade very evenly across my lips and it stays comfortable the whole time it fades. Sometimes with other products I get a weird ombr√© lip as they fade or they stop being comfortable when there's not a full amount of product left on the lips. These definitely never leave my lips feeling dry as they wear away, which is nice! 

I almost never go through an entire lip product, but I've gone through both of these shades and repurchased. I hope Hourglass keeps them around!!!  I really love the color and how this makes my lips fill moisturized, however, it's not permanent, I have to keep reapplying.  I would love this color in a permanent stain!  The packaging is beautiful!  This company is cruelty-free, it gets my vote!!  Hourglass has become one of my favorite brands and the best part they are CRUELTY FREE!!! These lip colors glide on super smooth and dont dry out my lips. I have the colors Achiever and Influencer. I paired Influencer with their Eden lipliner and its a beautiful combination. As long as they dont change the formula and stay cruelty free, ill keep repurchasing. Hopefully they add more colors.  I first had a lip stylo in Futurist, which is a beautiful nude color if you're pinky-pale like me. It's moisturizing and opaque, but doesn't feel like a lipstick, more like a Clinique chubby stick, just not as translucent. It lasts a decently long time, but as does most lipstick that has a lustre you'll need to reapply from time to time. Personally, I don't mind that. Unfortunately, I had it in a trial size and the lid came off, ruining it, but I'm sure that won't happen with the full size."

221,221,beautycounter,at the red-y clean lip duo set,pimprod2041104,2616308,"  These are the first Beautycounter products I have tried and I am very pleasantly surprised! I have a small, flat top lip and most reds make me look like a clown. This is a great color and stayed on super well through the day! I am a serial chapstick person. Like, 50 times a day...it has to feel perfect at all times. I only felt like i needed to apply the gloss a few times throughout my day. It was really nice lol  The lipstick was great - I'm a fan of te formula and the new red shade was perfect. The gloss waa a miss. The one I got in the set smelled like bad plastic. I ended up throwing the gloss away because the smell/taste is so bad. Ive purchased this gloss before in other colors. I guess having stuff smell and taste bad is always a risk with clean beauty products."
