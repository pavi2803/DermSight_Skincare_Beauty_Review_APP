0,nyx professional makeup,buttermelt pressed powder blush,pimprod2045333,2624632," * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I'm obsessed with Nick's Buttermilk Blush! First of all, it smells amazing—like, I legit want to sniff it all day. The pigmentation is on point, so you definitely get your money's worth. I got the shade Filling Butta (also says Shimmering Terracotta on the packaging), and I am so here for it.

Even though it's technically a blush, it actually works beautifully as a bronzer, which is exactly how I've been using it. The shimmer in it gives such a warm, glowing finish, and it's perfect for adding a subtle sun-kissed vibe. Honestly, it does its job—and does it well. All-in-all, it's a fun, versatile product that I'd recommend if you want something that doubles as blush and bronzer * I've bought two of the Buttermelt blushes and the colors of the makeup don't match the case.  I bought Butta Together and For the Butta.  Both look too artificial and vivid on my skin, not natural at all.  FtB is not soft rose, it's bright magenta. * Very pigmented * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] love the bronzers but I don't think the blushes ade for me , I have dry skin on my cheeks so that tends to emphasize my pores and my skin a lot , it's really pretty it's just the shimmer isn't my thing in thw blushes . packaging is nice and sleek , pigment is there 10/10 and no scent , it's an amazing product just not for me . * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I've just started becoming a blush girl, and I must say this blush is amazing. It's a blush that's kind of mixed with a highlighter so it's kind of like a two and one and I'm obsessed. * This blush is absolutely stunning! I have the shade Butta Together and I love the baby pink tones! It blends so seamlessly and stays in place. It also gives the most beautiful shine effect. * This will last a long time especially since I accidentally bought 2 but its great color and easy to work with."
1,perricone md,no makeup blush,pimprod2004408,2541775," * This is by far my favorite EVER blush!! I have goofy combo skin and some fine lines-this blush goes on so nicely and it doesn't make my face look more oily in my t zone and it does not settle into drier skin and lines! Absolutely worth the price and I hope they never stop making this blush! * I love this and the color but it used to have spf in it. Now it's just a regular blush. I noticed the brand has been doing away with the products being spf. Which is a shame since that's the reason I stocked up in early spring. Now since it has no spf, I am in no hurry to purchase. I still miss there spf gloss that used to be this color. * I've been using this blush for over a year now and I love this stuff!  I have dry, flaky skin and using powder blush accentuates my dry spots. This blush gives me a beautiful glow with some added moisture.  Long lasting and beautiful! I really think this blush would be good for all skin types especially dryer skin, a little goes a long way! * I love this blush in the summer when I need a bit of a boost on my cheeks for going out after doing some sun loving activities. I have sensitive skin, so when working outdoors I can only have sunscreen. Due to the sunscreen in the blush this helps being able to put some neutral makeup on for work without the risk of my face getting sunburned with regular makeup. I love the neutral color. Perricone MD used to sell an spf lipgloss in this color as well, I wish they brought back the lipgloss as it smelled great and worked fantastically. * CONS 
1. This blush burnt my skin. 
I applied the blush almost daily for several months. 2 weeks ago the skin on my cheek bones where the blush touched (in the exact shape I apply my blush) got a terrible allergic reaction: painful, red, extremely dry and bumpy. It has been several days of using soothing skincare, and the irritation is still there, although very slowly subsiding. 
2. As other reviewershave mentioned, the cap cracks easily when you screw the top closed. 

PROS 
The shade is buildable and starts very subtle. I have light skin, cool undertone, and this blush looked beautiful. * i only used this once or twice. i screwed the cap on too tight one time and the lid breaks and the stopper sank to the bottom. please replace the cheap plastic with metal. * I love the color of this blush and it blends beautifully. Big drawback though is the packaging. The lid completely cracked when I tightened it. I love this blush but now I can't take it anywhere. Please fix this packaging!!!!!"
2,e.l.f. cosmetics,camo liquid blush,pimprod2042954,2617738," * My first tike using and i enjoyed it. However, i did feel that it would get a lil patchy after my second use. Im not sure if it was the products under but i noticed it looked patchy. Would like to try a deeper berry color * Dewy without being glossy. Very complimentary color and could be built up if you wanted. Blends very nicely. * Beautiful color and pigmenation. * Wonderful pigmentation and texture. * This product is really nice. The color pay off is good, but I did not wear it for more than 4 hours so I am not sure of how long this cream blush will last. I would buy this product in another color. Easy to use and blendable. [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] * I received this product for free for my honest review and I thought the product worked really well. The lilac color was pigmented but was buildable. You can use a light wash of color and blend it out or build it up depending on how much you used . * These are IT.  They will last forever.  Gorgeous gorgeous.  No need for highlight!  Super pigmented - a little goes a long way so the best way to use these is to tap the product onto your hand, and use the ELF blush brush (a loosely packed angled brush).  Work blush into the brush and then lightly tap onto the cheekbones.  I'm super fair and I was able to used Bronze Bombshell!  I also have Peach Perfect and Dusty Rose.  I'll probably end up with all the colors eventually."
3,dior,rosy glow blush,pimprod2039824,2612203, * I now get the hype of this blush on. The shade pink really adopt the skin tone you have… This is the pink blush on I am looking for…I think it is similar to milani's luminoso shade…without the shimmer…I just think so * I fell in love with the Lilac Pink color. It looks beautiful with my complexion. The packaging is luxe so it gives me a little joy to see it among the more budget friendly makeup I normally use. The blush has a faint fruity scent which is so delightful when applying but fades quickly so is not bothersome. So initially I 100% fell in love with this blush. But after only a few weeks of use it developed hardpan and I couldn't get any product on my brush. Scraping the blush or using tape to remove the upper layer is helping get to the good product but it quickly hardpans again. I should be able to get through the blush but won't repurchase. For that kind of money I expected much better performance. I don't have this problem with the drugstore blushes I use. * I have the lavender shade & you literally have to dig in the product for any pigment. I use this on days where im trying to look like im wearing no makeup. Definitely not worth the price. * I have the lavender shade & you literally have to dig in the product for any pigment. I use this on days where im trying to look like im wearing no makeup. Definitely not worth the price. * Surprised by the high rating on this particular product. The pink has ZERO pigment. Ill try to use a spray on the compact itself to lift the product but it is absolutely not worth the money. * Very pretty blush. I'm hoping it will look great during the summer when I have more color as I chose the cherry shade which is absolutely gorgeous. * I love this blush! I use it over my YSL liquid blush abd the combo is unreal. Please bring back the lavender shade! It's sooo pretty!
4,benefit cosmetics,liquid lip blush & cheek tint,pimprod2008308,2547730," * Four stars for the color alone; FINALLY a lip stain that works on light olives and isn't just an oversaturated red/hot pink. Brands: take notes! This doesn't last as long on the lips as I had hoped, but it is decent. The worst part about this product for me is the rose scent. I absolutely cannot stand rose and I especially don't want it on my lips. Thankfully, the scent does disappear fairly quickly and doesn't linger. * I will not be recommending this product to anyone.  It dried out my lips so badly and the color isn't consistent on my lips and looks splotchy. * It's a little pricey for the size of the product but it's definitely worth it. I really like the color selection and it's convenient for travel. * I would not recommend this to anyone!!  It doesnt stain the lips like it should and it's definitely not worth the price!!  I would not buy this again!! * I love the color the it gives you in lips and cheeks * I don't wear lipstick or gloss; I prefer a natural stain that gives a hint of color but also stands up to my lip balm addiction. I had found the perfect stain at The Body Shop but had to find a replacement once I ran out of my stash. Enter this Benefit lip stain. I love the desert rose color, but this doesn't work anything like my Body Shop stain.  One application gives great natural color that dries quickly, but it also vanishes quickly. There isn't even a hint of tint left after less than an hour of normal wear. Needs some work on the staining part of the formula. * I grabbed the Play Tint color during 50% off sale days because I've  been in search for a good lip stain…but this didn't do it for me. This tint was not a good color of my lips…it's very peach-ish and felt a bit heavy. I did try it with another color over it (to make it work) but still didn't care for it. Returned."
5,nars,blush,pimprod2044741,2621261," * I bought this on sale and I'm happy so far with purchase. I'm pretty pale and this looks nice, doesn't take too much and I like that it has a slight bit of shimmer so my skin looks brighter and healthier. I think it will last me awhile too. * I was so disappointed when I received this blush. It was NOT like the same product I'd been using. Thinking that maybe I'd ordered the wrong color, I went into Ulta and they told me the formula had been changed!!! Not nearly as pretty. I returned for refund. * Very elegant and mature color * I was a little hesitant when I first purchased this. I grabbed this blush during the 21 day beauty sale. I have worn the traditional orgasm blush for years which has shimmer and IMO, it is very sheer and gorgeous . I wanted to try the matte version. It does appear to look a lot darker and almost like it is a totally different color compared to the  orgasm original w/ shimmer, in the pan. Once u put on the blush it is really pretty. Be warned, a little of the matte goes a long way, whereas the original I applied a lot more. I am very pale and this will be great to switch up for fall winter months and spring summer go back to the shimmer version. NARS has the best blush. * First time purchasing anything from NARS. This blush is everything. I totally love it. * Flawless formula, both matte and glowy shades. Velvety, effortlessly blendable, and perfect for any skin type * Color, while complementary to my skin tone, is not as vibrant or long lasting as my other NARS. It also seems to have a new ingredient that irritates my skin. With how expensive NARS is, likely won't purchase again."
6,pixi,on-the-glow blush tinted moisture stick,pimprod2032976,2598116," * This blends into my skin so perfectly and diffuses the redness in my cheeks as well. I apply in a triangular shape and pat in and you cannot tell its there, its so natural. I also love that it is moisturizing, and it doesnt cause me to break out like other blushes ive tried. * Been wanting to try and cream blush for awhile now and I really like this one. Easy to apply and it's such a pretty shade of pink! * A little too Barbie pink for me * Wow… just wow this blush is so pretty i have the ruby shade and it is the prettiest most affordable blush i own. I have fair skin and this makes me look sunkissed and it is so natural but buildable so if you like more blush you can layer it and it will look stunning! * This helped me in the sun and it was like and easy makeup cause during the summer I seem to get darker and the blush helped me so munch buy this product for my tan people love this and a person at my church camp used it she got so many complements on her blush * I love this blush so much!! It was one of the first makeup products I ever got back in 2022 and as of right now, it's almost halfway done, though I also use different blushes right now. I always end up going back to it every now and then though because Ruby has such a beautiful and perfect color and the cream texture makes it last long on your face! It also matches Benetint very well so I usually use this stick on top. If you need a low-cost, high quality blush that looks good, is on the go-compatible, and reliable, get this one! * I got the shade ruby and its amazing! But after 30 minutes its gone. People think i have blish blindness but i have to pack it on un order for it to stay. So convenient and i like the application, unfortunately all together, id rather have a blush that lasts."
7,pur,silky tint creamy multitasking stick,pimprod2044097,2620463," * The color is actually really pretty and love that my lipstick matches my blush and it's all in one.  I also like that is matt and that if I want to gloss it up I could just add on a gloss, or keep it matte.  Most importantly comes from a brand that is natural and healthy. * As a clean beauty enthusiast, I eagerly took the opportunity to try the Silky Tint multitasking stick. I'm new to the brand, but I love these easy two-in-ones that eliminate the guesswork of coordinating lip colors with blush. 

Lately, I've been into skincare makeup, and this stick is pure magic. Not only is it serum-based and infused with peptides, but it also blends into the skin beautifully. You can apply it with a brush or your fingertips, and I found that both methods are equally effective. 

Although I usually stick to warm-toned blushes, Sparkling Rose is a neutral shade that would look great on anyone's skin tone. I expected it to be sheer, but it is packed with pigment. I plan to wear this shade for a Mother's Day brunch, and I'm excited to see how it complements my look.

I used to be obsessed with a similar clean beauty color stick, but I had to keep the inner seal on to prevent it from drying out. Then, when it was reformulated, the formula changed to a more sheer version, which I didn't love as much because I prefer more pigment in my products. I also like the grippy texture of this stick, as it won't slide off my face in the heat.

The lid snaps tightly closed, so you don't have to worry about it popping open in your bag. I added a lip liner, and it wears just as well as a lipstick. I stick to an 80/20 rule, trying to keep my makeup choices more on the clean beauty side, and this is a wonderful addition to my collection—perfect for adding to a Mother's Day gift basket or for the upcoming wedding season. 

It has a dreamy formula and a romantic shade. Best of all, it doesn't contain any harmful toxins or ingredients. I'm enthusiastically looking forward to trying more from this brand! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This was a nice blush. Overall it wasn't my favorite formula- it would occasionally lift my foundation underneath but with patience and a brush application it was nice. * Product goes on smooth but my skin is too tan to see it and I'm not that dark. It completely disappeared on my cheeks. Its not easy to put on your lips if you have a defined cupids bow. * I like this cream stick blush lip color,  it's creamy and a nice natural color and it has staying power.  I like that it does last and last all day long, and it looks very natural.  I also love this as lip color. * This cream blush stick/ lipstick is a great versatile product. It's is a beautiful pink color and it really works well on cheeks or lips. The only issue is that it can be a little greasy and heavy on the cheeks, but it's a great product to carry that works in different applications. * The whole line is sadly so drying"
8,juvia's place,blushed duo,pimprod2025280,2583745," * This blush is very good. Easy to apply. * I love how pigmented this blush is! A little goes a long way and I love the choice of 2 colors! I will definitely be checking out other blush combinations with these palettes * My fav blush i bought 4 * Not pigmented * I love this blush! It's very pigmented and longwearing. I have medium skin, and I definitely have to be light with this blush or it will be too pigmented on my skin. So I use a thinner slanted brush to get a light application, and I don't have any issues. I ordered volume 3 because I thought the brown shade would be a terracotta kind of color, but it shows more pinky red on me. I also thought the other shade would be more red, but it's definitely a berry shade. Not what I was expecting from the photo, but both colors are really gorgeous and flattering on my medium olive skin! * OKAY SO I ALREADY WAS AWARE ABT HOW JUVIAS IS SUCH A GOOD BRAND BUT SHE TRULY SURPRISED ME!!! Ive been trying to get my hands on this blush and i finally did!!! I got the volume 4 and its PIGMENTATION IS AMAZING!! EASY TO APPLY AND HAS A MIRROR!! * This blush is very pigmented . 
I've yet to wear it but its so pretty.
Its very inexpensive."
9,morphe,huephoric rush 3-in-1 silk blush,pimprod2045434,2625272," * Why isnt anyone talking about the shade Touched ? Its unlike any other shade and looks so good on my medium tan skin.  

The formula is excellent too. I found this easier to apply using a denser brush, rather than my usual blush brush. It has a beautiful finish and lasted the entire workday. 

I dont need any more blushes but Im really loving this formula ! * I love this. Already need few back ups. It blends very well, color is very good and it lasts. * I was looking for an alternative to powder blush because of the talc and decided to try this one. I could NOT be happier with this blush! Its creamy and super pigmented so it just takes just little bit to add and blend. I use my finger to dab and then go over with my brush, blends easily and stays all day! * I have been so curious about lavender or purple blushes so I finally ordered this morphe cream blush. Can't believe I waited so long to try this formula! Creamy long lasting & product forever! * I love this blush! I feel like it is very long lasting. It is very pigmented so a little goes a long way. Layered with my powder blush beautifully. * I don't reach for any other blush anymore... this is insanely easy to use. Like I usually just use my fingers to grab the product and work it into where I want it to go! Seriously, it melts into the skin. Kinda have to work fast before it dries, but once you work it into the skin- it has a flawless blurring butter finish. I set it with any blurring powder blush and setting spray for GLAM days, but for everyday wear it lasts all day w/o setting spray or powder. Dewy, skin finish. I am obsessed and will be grabbing again. * I really wanted to like this product but after an hour or so it looks really patchy on the skin and breakd down quickly"
10,too faced,cloud crush blurring blush,pimprod2036986,2603636," * In the pan, it looks like a chalky light mauve, which had me doubting it would work on me and confused thinking I received the wrong order… but on the skin its a perfect, natural, warm pink flush. It looks just like the promo photos. It's my second Cloud Blush from Too Faced, and I can confidently say, it's my favorite powder blush. The colors stay throughout the day regardless of humidity & oil, and the blurring is real. Even when I dont wear any type of base like primer, foundation, or concealer on my cheeks, it literally erases my pores and melts into my skin like a cream. I also have Tequila Sunset, and that color is just incredible. Its the perfect punchy coral color for literally any occasion. I was wearing it as my daily blush until I recently bought Velvet Crush for some variety. * I bought this blush mainly because the packaging was super cute but when I first tried it out it was such a beautiful experience! It's very pigmented and blends easily. * Im in love with this blush. Getting other colors. Its the best blush Ive ever used. It blurs/softens and very pigmented. The only thing i dont like is that the compact is difficult to open especially if you have long nails. * Love this product !!! Its pigmented!! Can blend easily and it last all
Day long * I love this blush, pretty packaging, great pigment, lightweight, smells soft and sweet. * This blush is super pigmented and beautiful on the skin it has a matte blurring finish * love"

12,juvia's place,blushed liquid blush,pimprod2038948,2609909," * Beautiful color for medium/deep skin. I looked everywhere for a warm red blush. Love this and used it for my wedding. The review that said a ballpoint pen dot is enough is right! Try on back of hand or palette first. Long-lasting and rich. * Color last all day * Best blush ever👅👅 * I have dry skin, my makeup products need to be liquid.  I love the high pigmented colors.  I purchased, Pink Lady Glow; It's has a youthful radiance and sparkles. It looks beautiful on my fair/medium skin tone.  A itty-bitty dot goes a long ways. * I never go with such a pink blush, but as of this summer i have switched it up ans been obsessed * My skin color is pretty dark so people always tell me you should like use a dark purple shade blush and I thought about it and I now bought it and it's pretty and gorgeous!!! Do recommend for my dark skin girlies!💕 * A dot goes a long way. Seriously ! Its very pigmented and bright u just need a dot to color your cheeks"

14,tarte,shape tape glow blush bar,pimprod2044745,2622622," * I love this palette. Im not big on blush because my cheeks are red. Im always trying to cover the redness. I love all three shades of the lighter one. The highlighter is amazing looks good everywhere. I wear it as eyeshadow also. Im shocked but i love the blush. Thanks again tarte!!! * This palette is amazing!! The bronzer is the perfect shade, im light-medium skin tone and i find it perfect. The blushes are gorgeous!! Pigmented and beautiful! I kind of compared the blushes to the new rare one, but i like this better. I really recommend this palette, if you can find it, run for it! * I was so excited to see Tartes new glow bar the colors are perfect for summer * The blushes and highlighter in this palette are pigmented and gorgeous!!! * I bought this and have been lovong the sparkling blushes and the highlighter. These are super pigmented and pretty for spring and summer * I was hesitant to order this palette seeing there wasn't any reviews & also knowing the lack of tone range within Tarte's line however....this is beautiful!! I ordered the 'Berry Bar' ((darker one)) and it does compliment my skin tone perfectly, which is medium to tan in most makeup lines. I can get A LOT of color payoff using a light hand,  every color has a dewy glow, and lasted thru my 10 hour work day. The only critique I can imagine would be the bronzer not working for anyone darker than a tan skin tone. If you have a deep color, the bronzer may just give you a pretty glow without a pigment. Overall, I really like this palette thus far & can most def see me reaching for this more than not!"

16,e.l.f. cosmetics,halo glow blush beauty wand,pimprod2038825,2609251," * Great product for older skin. Looks natural and does not crease. * I used it for a while, but it just can't see it. It is see-able for the first 5 seconds but then it fades and has no color. * the applicator is a mess ans just really gross over a long time * This is very pigmented and lasts all day. I love that iit gives a glowy sheen after application. The tube can get a lot of product out which can lead to a dirty cap/full if you do not use all of the product on the applicator. I'm excited to try different shades. * I had never used a liquid blush before and loved it. However the package leaks and now the sponge applicator has broken off inside the cap and I can't get it out. I still have a lot of product left and am not sure how I will continue to use it.  I do love elf products and will continue to use.  I will get the liquid blush in a different bottle next time. The one with the wand that pulls out of the bottle I think will be better. * I can't say, enough about these blushes. They last all day and they are all so pretty. I get compliments all the time on itt. * i like my blushes to be more on the matte side so i believe thats why i dont really like this one. it has a lot of glitter in it and i think it takes away from the pigment a lot. it was also very difficult for me to blend out."
17,stila,blush & bronze hydro-blur cheek duo,pimprod2042663,2617321," * I love the color combination of this product and how its sheer and can't mess it up. I ordered the grapefruit pink combo and its amazing. * Loving this creamy blush! * Obsessed. It is easy to use, compact, travels well and convenient! Definitely will be buying in other colors as well. * The blush is very pretty but the contour part came smushed and once i turned the tube to bring product down it completely fell off the tube. Not my favorite for my first time trying this product * I have fallen in love with this duo! I got Grapefruit/Caramel and the colors are amazing! Super creamy and easily blends. The case is cute and works great and the product lasts a long time even with daily use! * Love this hybrid gel cheek duo * I purchased the Grapefruit and Caramel color. I tried it out with my fingers and a brush.

The good;
-Pretty colors. They swatch mat but do blend out sheer and become part of the skin. 
-Elegant formulation with a creamy and light feel on the skin. 
-Easy to use, compact and portable.
-No discernable scent. 
-Neither the bronzer nor the blush have any glowy particles. 

The not so good;
-I am fair but cool toned and ALL the colors are warm on me. Why Stila, why? 
-Once applied the blush and bronzer become sheer and the colors disappear as they blend in. 
-I had to do multiple layers before I could truly see any color payoff.
I am tempted to purchase a darker color combination just so it would show up. 

Overall this is a clever, very convenient, and  portable product. Perhaps great for on the go touchups. But it is so sheer and blends out on my skin so much that there is virtually nothing left."
18,nars,afterglow liquid blush,pimprod2039276,2617037," * This blush is actually really good and the color is gorgeous, but it is a pretty thin liquid. * I have always loved the shade Orgasm on my fair skin and freckles. The liquid version is even better because it is so blendible and buildable. * I havent stopped raving about this product since buying it a few months ago but my only problem with it is the container, which is so awful I feel it deserves to lose 2 stars :(
I have always stored this blush upright and it never tips over with the way my makeup box is structured, but somehow the product seeps out into the top of the applicator and its just so messy. I have resorted to picking ip product from the screw-like pieces when using to keep it from getting unbearably messy. 
Otherwise, the color and sheen are percect for my preferences and skin tone (I'm very fair skinned with cool undertones). Product is buildable so I can tailor my look super easily. 
Also works nicely with my fingers, a brush (my preferred method), or sponge. 

Nars: PLEASE fix the stopper or whatever is causing this issue. I beg of you! * I liked the original nars blush that came with the pump. I feel it was better pigmented and I feel that with the newer bottle you do not get as much product as before. I will not buy again. * Im neutral with this blush. I have the color orgasm and like the peachy pink color. It is sheer and you can build it up a little bit. I like it because its natural and gives my face a little color.  I found it easy to blend with a brush but I felt like it didnt last long. I usually pair this with another cream blush or set it with a little powder blush. While its nice I don't think its worth the price when there are so many other options out there. * Great color for my skin type and easy to use and super pigmented and super soft application. * I have this in 3 different shades & it's amazing!!    The colors are gorgeous, it blends like a dream, and it really wears all day!!    I'm over 50 so I switched from powder blush a few years ago but never really found anything I was happy with - until this!!   It may seem pricey but a little goes a long way - and it really lasts ALL day…I'm talking about through a 10-12 hour shift and it still looks great."

This blush gives me so much glow that my father in law thought I was pregnant. Its so easy blend too. I just use my finger and it's easy to build as well. I'll never buy another blush again. * This is my favorite blush!! It is acne safe and I am on my 4th one. Highly recommend. It lasts a long time even in Florida. * I use this blush often dont get me wrong i love me a good pigmented cream blush. I have this product in about 2-3 shades but i just highly dislike that its gets so dirty so easily. Its very sticky and no matter how much i wipe the dirty surface with a wipe it gets dirty again. I love me my fenty products but this packaging must be worked on * I really wanted to like this product. The packaging is durable and very attractive. Color os gorgeous but when I would go to blend it with other go to products it just did not work for me. I ended up giving it a away to a younger cousin who likes to play with makeup. * This blush is SO good for a natural look. If you have mature and dry skin,this blush is for you! I have the colors petal poppin(soft pink)and peach face(soft peach). Peach face is my favorite! It is very natural looking on me! * Beautiful and soft blush. I like the color and it is easy to use and blend. * I love this blush profoundly. Its more expensive than the blush products i was using before. But its so worth the cost. A little goes such a long way and theyre so creamy i just love them."

It blends beautifully and is buildable in the best ways.  I dont notice a ton of sparkle as people are commenting on, just a nice blush in a sponge applicator that lasts and lasts.  Though I have been using this for a fee years I am just starting my 4th tube * Looked very oily and felt sticky * I love blushes and have tried..a LOT. And i was surprised to see negative reviews because this one is stunning. pigmented, glowy, blendable, smoothe & long-lasting. everything i could hope for! I have 3 shades and all are chefs kiss 🤌 * I returned this product after using it twice because I didn't like the shimmer and color. I have fair skin and didn't pick a color that complimented me. But I didn't exchange it for a different color because of the shimmer. I like a little glow, but the shimmer overpowered the color. I did like the applicator tip, which is why I bought this product. It was easy to apply to my skin and somewhat ok with blending. It was a little difficult to blend out the imprint of the circle after I dabbed it on my face. * I bought this because of all the ads on instagram and I am so glad I did.  It's a beautiful glowy finish that's easy to apply and blend."
23,polite society,polite pops powder blush stick,pimprod2044285,2620621," * I received this blush in the color Sydney, and I absolutely love it! I have olive toned Asian American skin that tans easily in the summer. It applies effortlessly without the need for an additional applicator or brush. It applies with the smoothness of a cream with an immediate powder like finish. It applies lightly with the first application which makes it easy to build with additional applications for richer color if needed. I love it! Lasts all day! * I got this for my daughter, for her birthday. It was a brands that was part of a sale/deal. So the price was amazing. She had never tried this brand before and it became a favorite product immediately. She wants more colors. I will say they are very small/compact, but a little does go a long way!   Perfect for on the go/travel makeup bags. If they have any deals, GRAB Some! * Recommanded product * This formula is so dry. I also have very dry skin so unfortunately that's not a winning combo. I tried warming it up on the back of my hand too. If you have oily skin maybe this will work? The product also fell out of the packaging the 3rd time I tried using it. All in all would not recommend, 2 stars because the shade was what I expected. * I already have London and Paris. But I really wanted Los Angeles, which is a real pink pink, to add to my collection. This was perfect I got it on a sale 50% off, yay! I found you need a little practice getting this on. I learned not to use a brush with it or it will come off. Best thing to do roll it on your face where you want it and tap on it to blend it in. I put it on a clean moisturized face and it last all day. * Love the color Paris for a my light to fair completion. It seems a little dry, but it doesn't affect the use. I still get great color payoff and silky smooth blending. Love it & wish I bought two when it was on sale. Also rates well on Yuka! * I picked the color Sydney and it is perfect for my skin tone. This goes on so we'll I almost don't have to blend it in!"
24,mac,glow play blush,pimprod2013050,2583438," * I bought this blush two different times with two different orders under a month's span and both times it shipped to me it arrived broken. Im sure its a beautiful color, but theyre both broken to the point where i cannot even use them at least once. Im returning both unfortunately. * This blush is absolutely beautiful!! Not only do I glow to the gods but it lasts!! I literally plan on buying them all!! * The texture freaked me out at first, but it's so light and creamy. It's great for my older skin. * At a certain point, I moved from powder to creme blush and I've tried most, this at the top. I apply this formula with a beauty blender and it goes on so well. Application is easy and the color (blush please) is subtle and perfect on my light to medium color skin. My only complaint? I'd love to see more colors! * I was searching for a product that blends easily and stays on...this is it * Bought this on a whim and loved it so much that i bought 2 more!! Blush please is my favorite on my fair skin for everyday, but they're all great! I put them over powder and they don't disrupt anything underneath, and they give my cheeks a very subtle but healthy glow. The blend is seamless and they have great lasting power with me working a 12 hour shift!! Highly recommend, these deserve more hype! * I have used SO MANY different blushes, but this one I can't get over! I got it in the shade blush please which given my fair completion, shows up more peachy. Its creamy, but works beautifully on both bare skin and powder which is why I love it!"
25,smashbox,halo sculpt + glow face palette with vitamin e,pimprod2042910,2618546," * Very little pigment and all of the shades are chalky. I'm a light, warm skin tone and the second shade barely showed up on my skin. This could be decent for a fair complexion but for the price, the quality is not worth it. Also the packaging is terrible! The lid does not stay up/back when you're trying to use it, it's very annoying to keep having to open it every few seconds. Save your money! * I love this palette. I use ""back to Cali"" and I have medium toned skin with yellow undertones. It is perfect! The brown is great for contouring, I use the light pink in the winter and the dark pink in the summer on my cheekbones, and the shimmer at the top of my cheekbones for extra glow. The amount of product in this palette makes it worth the money in my opinion. Would definitely buy again! * This is an ok palette. Nothing special about it. I love Smashbox one of my favorite brands but this is not worth the money and again the shades are just ok. * I was so excited to travel with this slim multi-puspose quad. Ordered it online during and upon arrival the highlighter pan was crumbling and what was left fell out of the pan. Perhaps that was due to delivery/mail packaging. However, not much pigment transferred from the beautiful neutral bronzer to a brush or even finger swatch for it to be useful on my skin. It almost felt hard-panned before even using it. Thankfully bought it on sale but otherwise would not purchase full price. * Don't waste your money! The colors are not pigmented. * ❤️❤️❤️❤️ * I bought the Back to Cali palette and it's my perfect everyday work palette. It's so easy, I do my makeup in 15min and it looks so beautiful and natural. I have light neutral skin and it gives me a healthy natural flush. It comes with an intert on how to apply the 4 products in the palette which I always follow. I love it! It does have a bit of an odd smell which isn't my favorite but the payoff is so good I can ignore it."
26,bareminerals,gen nude blonzer blush + bronzer,pimprod2031864,2594966," * This is my second blush that I have and I jist hit pan on my first one but I made sure to buy a second one just incase the other one finishes. This is a perfect shade and has blush, highlight, bronzer all in one. * Mauve definitely suggests pink hues but this looks very ORANGE toned on the skin. Im very fair, but it still should not look orange ir coppery.  I understand its a bronzer too, but it looked cool toned in photo. * This is light weight and beautiful. Bare Minerals is the best! * Just buy this. I can't even say how long I have looked for a blush like this. I was struggling with blush for my son's wedding earlier this year. Many blushes were chalky and wore off lightning fast. Or, they were liquid or creme and settled into every single imperfection. Both baaaaddddd.

Bare Minerals for the win here. This BLONZER is so pigmented and long lasting. Seriously it does not wear off! A very little goes a very long way so start with a light application. The color selection is rad and I highly suggest trying it at ULTA to get your perfect color. I tried two colors and came away with the pink tone as my choice. All the colors are beautiful and this surfer chick is happy to have solved her blush dilemma (thank you Jesus). A bonus is that you don't have to rebuy frequently due to the heavy pigment. It lasts and lasts. Mine still looks new after 5 months. This Bare Minerals Blonzer is also a money saver that way!

PS: Wedding photos came out legit and the blush never needed to reapply. Stoked. * Pigmented but very shimmery. Looks almost like I put shimmer eyeshadow on my cheeks? * I purchased the Kiss of Rose color.  An Ulta associate helped me find this color. I absolutely love how it looks on my skin tone. I've even received compliments from complete strangers. * I got Kiss of Rose when it was on sale and it did not disappoint. I am pretty fair and a little goes a long way but it gives a really nice rose bronze color. Best of all is it doesn't look orange on me like I run in to with a lot of bronzers (which is part of why i bought it in the first place). It is a more obvious look so thats why i went back and got Kiss of Pink for more subtle makeup days. The pink is definitely more a blush with less bronze effect but still pretty."
27,tarte,amazonian clay 12-hour blush,pimprod2043868,2618995," * I used this blush in Natural beauty for the last ten years. Repurchased it recently online (the local ulta was out of stock of this color. If I had swatched it, I might not have gotten it)
  THe color upon opening was very different. Much lighter than the old formula AND lighter than the product photo. The old color was such a nice natural fit, that one time I overdid it a bit and kept getting asked if I had a fever (rather than thinking I had too much blush on) 
   I was initially going to return the item, but after trying on.. I thought the color was still pretty, albeit not the color I wanted. I figure I have it, I will give it a go. It does take more swipes to get it to look as vibrant and the color has more of a mauve undertone than the last formula. the last formula was more reddish peachy undertone. 
  There is less product as well, but shrinkflation is everywhere and I am going to assume it costs them more to make to go vegan. I do like that it is vegan now, though. 
  I would give it less stars because the color changed...except the color is still very pretty.. despite having to use more. Still a natural pink, and it is buildable. 
  Pardon my bad swatch photo. * Wanted to branch out and really nail a look for my wedding day. LOVED the look of this blush. With excellent pigment and a full soft tone that completed my look. * I love this blush! This is my third time buying it. * I really loved the rich berry color one that I got and the color pay off! It's very pigmented which I love and the color lasts. It seems to be pretty tox in ingredients which is also nice. I will definitely be buying this again and will be buying more colors! * The colors are fantastic and buildable.  I LOVE this blush.  I've tried everything and its bar none my favorite. * I have oily skin and wore this blush for many years- Dollface was the best color. They discontinued doll face full size and travel size. I've purchased four other colors and none work for me. Please bring back Dollface! * So sad at the formula change. The shade captivating has been my go-to shade for years and it was a perfect warm peachy shade and would last forever. It's so much lighter now (completely different color) and much less pigmented. Will be looking at other brands."
28,charlotte tilbury,matte beauty blush wand,pimprod2043369,2619515," * Pigment is good and it dries down crazy fast with a powder finish then doesn't move. You have to be quick and precise to blend it. I like some that I can shear out or move around until I set it, otherwise is comes out patchy. * I wanted to love this product so much! The color is beautiful. However, I find it very hard to blend and the container gets extremely messy. I don't use it for blush but I will use it on my lips and it works great as the stain. So it got three stars. * It's so pretty! Although for it being more high end you would think it would have more product! I have been using it for about a week and you can already tell that it lost alot of product and i'm not a full face girly either. I will stick to Rare Beauty liquid blush next time! It last forever. * Ok. I love the contouring wand. I am light to medium in in skintone. O tan in the summer. This blush is Amazing.. i have tried the other designer brands but they were all sticky and hard to blend.  This product hands down is worth every penny. Quality. I got the regular pillow talk matte color. It is buildable and beautiful. * It's hard to blend * Love this blush. Color, application, matte finish & wear are are all 5/5. Only con is applicator gets messy. Pillow talk is universally flattering but very flattering for brown hair/eye coloring * Love this blush. Color, application, matte finish & wear are are all 5/5.

Its my personal favorite :) * I absolutely love this blush it's so beautifully pink and so bright. Perfect for summer. Absolutely in love with it. * Foundation came on too heavy. * The sales clerk recommended this blush when the brand I usually use was out of stock.  I really like it and this is the second time I bought it. * This blush is perfect it looks so nice on and is good for the price! Very pigmented and looks stunning on. I also use this brand because they are cruelty free!!! * I wear this product in the shade ""New To U"", and it's fine. The color is very pretty and I like how buildable it is. I typically have to reapply it if I'm going to be wearing my makeup from more than 2-3 hours, but I don't personally mind that. My biggest gripe with this product is the packaging, as the plastic hinges on the compact lid wear down easily and eventually break off, leaving the pan and the lid in two separate pieces. It makes storing/traveling with this product impossible without it recieving (at least) minor damage. If you're looking for a Colourpop blush, I reccommend the super shcok formula or the cream blush sticks instead. * I went to replace my broken Prairie Air and since i last purchased in the fall, its been reformulated and is a completely different shade! So disappointing ive been wearing this color for years."

Very impressed with this product. * Best pallet ever it eill make your fay hy grtting it!!!! * I personally love this product. I used it for a year now and use it almost everyday and still havent hit pan! Its great * I loved the pigmentation and the color. * This is supposed to be a luxury brand and product but the packaging and compact are so cheap. Both blush and highlighter not adhered to pan then continued to crumble.  I have purchased so many Charlotte Tilbury products, some great products but rendered unusable by the cheap packaging.  CT is marketed as luxury however there are so many better luxury brands at same (or lower) price point with both exceptionally good product and packaging. CT needs review her product packaging, if the product is broken to the point of being unusable or messy people will go elsewhere. I know im done * I gave one star because of the e color, the light pink blush is pigmented and pretty on as is the highlighter. 
However for a Charlotte Tillbury product, supposedly lux, i would not expext the product to fall out of the pan upon opening the compact and be broken up.  Its obviously not a packaging error as im seeing it repeatedly in reviews that every brand new Hollywood Blush & Go palette has this problem no mattet where its purchased from. I have ised the sculpt and glow set for yeara and never had this issue, its just this blush and glow set with the highlighter loose from pallet's * Amazing product!

The color for me was off as well. I wanted it to be dark berry, but it' appeared more like bright pinkish color. * I purchased this product in hopes to maybe not like the benetint one as much but there were some clear differences between the two, this product feels like a bit more oily based as no matter how long I left it on my lips it never fully felt dry and whenever I would rub my lips together it felt glossy sliding over and the same can be said when I used it on my cheeks, it just kind of sat there and when I would try to blend it out the product would just kind of slide around. I wasn't able to build up the product because it didn't really go well with other products on my lips but I will say it was more pigmented than the benetint which I did love, Overall it's a decent dupe. * I love this lip and cheek product so much it's such a good dupe I'm definitely buying it again * This is the best product for summer and so cheap"

The colors are beautiful! The application is a dream and they give just that perfect flush of color! I purchased two shades and showed the line to my friend and she bought one. I do think it is overpriced but, as it should last a long time, I bit the bullet and bought it anyway. As I get older, I have decided become far more intentional in what I buy. The products I chose are generally more high end but, as a I end of with far fewer just tossed in a drawer, I think it is more cost effective in the end. * In love * Pretty color. Does the job. Too expensive. * I have light olive skin and often have difficulty finding colors that aren't too warm or cool. Lychee is perfect! Lasts all day while also managing to look natural. Does not highlight acne texture. The dimethicone in many blushes breaks me out and it's hard to find a product without it these days, happy to find this!

I did one swirl of my finger per cheek and patted it in with my finger(s). It melts in so beautifully and smoothly, blending in without blotchiness. It adds a nice glow (not sparkly or shiny) to my face, just complementing the glow from the foundation. 

I haven't used it on my lips because my lips are so dry that I can't really use any product other than lip repair products. * Red Camellia is 10/10. I wear this and only this unless I'm doing a full face. I use my finger to apply and a dense brush to blend. It's subtle and buildable, but most of all it gives my face ""life"" and a natural flush with just enough dew/hydrated  shine. I guess its similar to using vaseline as a highlighter, but better because it is CHANEL. * I absolutely adore this product. As a blush-oholic, I've tried every blush. This one takes the cake. This blush gives the perfect glow from within! I can put it on top of creams or powders. The finish is a natural glow. I use it on my cheeks & lips! Highly moisturizing & I very rarely have to reapply it on my lips. Which is saying alot! 
If I could have only one product, it would be this. In the red shade of course. Haha if you are thinking about it, do it! * Red camelia is the beat red. My favorite blush of all time. Its gorgeous. I have a pretty intense job, and this stays on all day. Really, i wonder why i use anything else. * My favorite 😍 * after many days of trying to figure out this product, ive decided i will be returning. the structure of the pot itself makes it extremely difficult to get the product out, especially if you have long nails. i typically have to use a brush or sponge to get in there. this product is patchy. i never get an even application with this & i always end up with more blush on one side than the other from trying to build the product up evenly.. it got to the point of my boyfriend, who never notices issues with my makeup, pointing it out. the product itself stays sticky on the cheeks, which im aware most cream products do, but if you have sensory issues & hate your hair getting caught on your face then you'll absolutely lose it with this. there is also no lasting power whatsoever. i have to take the sacrifice of looking absolutely crazy at the beginning of the day by overdoing it with the blush in order for it to somewhat last by the end of the day. honestly, ive tried better products for a significantly more affordable price. i'd pass on this going forward."

Not sure why they suggested this as a replacement. Fresh melon was a peachy pink with a dewy finish. For some reason none of the other shades look as glowingly radiant * I got the pot rouge in Chocolate Cherry, and it is not only a stunning color, but it is very buildable and blends nicely. It's also really convenient to keep in your purse. * What's not to love about this blush, pigmented, creamy, glowy, does not cause any irritation amd layers well for reapplication. For reference have this in the shade Powder Pink a gorgeous, subtle pinky brown shade which works so well on my Indian skintone. Please introduce some brown tone shades,please!!! * I love the color of Coral Calypso, it blends beautifully, it can be layered for a deeper pop of color and it lasts all day. I put it on at 5am and then when I get home at 6pm, its still there. I have super oily skin and live in a humid AF environment as well. So, I'm blotting my face at least twice a day with oil blotter sheets and it survives it. Disclaimer: I do use the Porefessional matte setting spray to set my face so that also attributes to its longevity. * This is a beautiful blush that blends out like a dream. I am normally not a fan of crème blush. I have never tried Bobbi Brown makeup before so will be trying more of her products. * Really great color pay off.

It looks natural like you had a sun kissed day outside in the sunshime. * I ordered the mauve and merlot shades in this blush as a light to medium neutral to warm girly.  The merlot shade will give you the most belivable and flattering blush, amd the mauve is a close second.  Pleasr don't sleep on this smooth and long lasting blush that will elevate your makeup game!

Quick and easy to apply. * This blush is absolutely beautiful. I did set it with the NYX buttermelt blush and it lasted the entire day. I was shocked. Ive been using the rare beauty liquid blush, set with rare beauty powder blush and it doesnt last this long. I also think this is way easier to blend in and doesnt dry too quickly to blend. Highly recommend! * I had this in the baby pink shade(can't remember the name) and the city sizzle shade. I have very fair cool/neutral skin that is typically dry. The baby pink shade was very pretty but definitely not pigmented enough for darker skin tones I would imagine. The City Sizzle shade is a sunburnt sort of color which isn't something I'd usually pick and frankly doesn't look very harmonious on me but my biggest issue is the ENORMOUS particles of glitter. I mean straight up silver craft glitter- maybe this visually blends more for people with darker skin tones but I have genuinely never used a blush that is this glittery. It takes away from the natural sunburnt look (if that's what you're going for) definitely a pass for me * Ok so this thing is like Waterproof! I swatched some of my other cream blushes, and even after using soap and water, this one stayed on my arm :). 

I was gifted the shade uptown glow and it is such a cute carrot-y shade with golden shimmer. I was  worried at first bc when I put it on my cheeks it was a bit patchy so I tried blending it out on the back of my hand first and that did the trick! I also add more directly onto the cheeks once the initial layer is laid down and blend it with a sponge so it's definitely buildable :). Maybe 2-3 layers? I think some ppl might not like it as much bc it gives more of a ""watercolor effect"" on the cheeks. If you're looking for rare beauty or Juvia's place pigment, this is not it, but if you're a subtle/sheer blush or ""gym"" kinda gal, I think you'll love it! * its a decent liquid blush that blends well when theres not a ton of other liquid makeup on the face already. i like to use this for days i just wear concealer and mascara. not sure if i would use this for a full face due to the texture and consistency. the color is vibrant! * its a decent liquid blush that blends well when theres not a ton of other liquid makeup on the face already. i like to use this for days i just wear concealer and mascara. not sure if i would use this for a full face due to the texture and consistency. the color is vibrant! * It is not overly pigmented with shimmer particles.

HOWEVER, it started crumbling apart in the pan. it's never been dropped. I have never traveled with it. it lives in my vanity drawer. every time I open it, it has just fallen apart more ! for the price of this product this is unacceptable. * Not packaged well at all. The blush came completely shattered. Disappointing, I wouldn't order this online from Ulta. * This blush is very build-able. I admit I was a little nervous when I first applied it and saw that it was faint, but after a few more swatches it built up into a beautiful shade. The blush lasted on my skin all day! (I have dry skin, I don't know if that helps) I genuinely think this is one of the best blushes on the market, you can tone it up or down and it looks so high quality! I'd say it's worth the hefty price tag! * I genuinely love this product for MY routine. I do bronzer so i need a nice blush to compliment it. This product works amazing over a liquid blush and it adds a nice sheer color ontop of the liquid blush. * I would love to write only good things about this blush because I really like the color and it suits my complexion. Its pillow talk. However, the quality and durability are really disappointing. The product is combined with a highlighter inside, and it cracked after just a few uses.

I have more of an olive skin tone and this mauve is perfect on me and gives off a nice glow. I am very happy with it. * I purchased this blush to give my cheeks a little shimmer compared to my matte blush. The photo of the product (and the actual product) appear light pink. However, when I applied it to my cheeks, it had more of a light orange tone. I wouldn't consider it ""mauve"" as the color description states. Then, when I was on a Zoom video call and saw myself the screen, the ""orange"" was amplified, which was bit of an unpleasant surprise to me. I ended up returning this blush. I wish this product came in more shades that have more of a pink hue."
44,fenty beauty by rihanna,hot cheeks velour blushlighter,pimprod2045516,2625693," * idk why the other reviews are complaining about too much glittler/sparkle when its called blushlighter. its meant to have some sparkle. it's absolutely gorg and just gives such a beautiful glow to your skin. i dont think it brings out a bunch of texture either. i wish it would let me insert a picture so you could see its not overly sparkly, just a pretty glow. you probably dont even need highlighter with this but im extra and always add the fenty diamond bomb. id def reccomend this * really loved fhe packaging and color of the blush but the color does not pick up at all on a brush or beauty blender. you really have to pack it on but it looks streaky after applying so much. milani has a better glowy blush. * I dont understand all the bad reviews. These blushes are gorgeous.  I have Juicy Peach and it is gorgeous on the skin, great color for a pop of peach pink on cheeks!   Yes it has some glitter but not a crazy amount.  I highly recommend! * I have a medium-tan skin tone and I couldn't decide which shade to purchase so I got both Juicy Peach and Baked Peach. They are very similar so you definitely don't need both. Juicy Peach doesn't have a lot of base pigment, it is more like a ""blush topper"", however the glow that it gives the cheeks is stunning, like a peachy/gold reflect. Baked Peach definitely has more of a base color, more like an actual blush. Baked Peach is more pink, the reflect is pink instead of gold. They are both very pretty, depends what look you're going for. I would say even someone with a lighter skin tone could use the darkest shade, as I had to build up to get it to show up (aka not a scary blush) * I love this product for the shimmering glow and rich peach tone! I enjoy the sparkle and it applied easily. I bought the darkest shade. * I got the shade Fresh Peach. It is stunning. Perfect for fair to light skin tones if you want that beautiful light pink flush with gold highlights. When I put it on, it just lights up my face so perfectly with a beautiful glow. I love this and want to get the other colors. Can't get enough. * I wanted to love this so bad because I love the packaging. It looks beautiful in the pan but absolutely no pigment shows up on my face. I bought the lightest shade and tried to build it many times and I ended up really just looking kind of orange with all the gold glitter. Not flattering on my light/medium skin. Going to have to return. :("
45,r.e.m. beauty,hypernova satin matte blush,pimprod2044063,2613119," * So I've been on the cream/liquid blush train for the past year or two and decided to try a powder again. I'm very pale and use fake tan to get to a light/medium skin tone and bought the shade Skinny Dipped. This is now my #1 blush. The color compliments my skin tremendously well, and it's so smooth - it looks airbrushed. I've used Nars, Nudestix, Rare Beauty, Saie, & others, and this one beats them all. * A nice flush of pink i love to use for a subtle hint of somethin! I sometimes see myself using it as just a base and layering on it. or I just use it on its own depending on the look I'm going for. I believe the pigment and color pay off is there compared to other blushes in my opinion. * I have get very oily throughout the day & the pigment still stayed on my face. I used the said pinkin of you & its perfect!! * Beautiful vibrant color, goes on easily and smooth This is my second blush from this brand and I want them all * This is the best powder blush I have ever used it's really pigmented and one of the best blushes overall * One of the best blushes I've ever used. It goes on smoothly and softly and blends effortlessly. Love it. * I purchased this with my own money. I got the shade ""rose on Mars"" and it is a beautiful dusty rose color. it really does blur out on your cheeks and is incredibly pigmented and lasts all day! a product I will repurchase for years to come"

I liked the idea of a sparkly blush for my theme, I tried applying it 3 times but the glitter didn't spread and it looked weird. I used a beauty blender, a brush, and my fingers but the glitter kinda just stayed, if there's a better method I would gladly hear you out but it just annoyed me * Obsessed with these blushes. Particularly the blushlighter shades. Little goes such a long way. Will last you forever. Beautiful color selection. Blend quickly, these set fast. * The pictures don't do this blush justice. Absolutely stunning and now one of my favorites. I will get another shade. I hope they carry this forever! * I love this product because I can use it on my lips, cheek, and eyes. A little goes a VERY long way so I feel like I have a life-time supply. I plan to purchase some of the other colors. * I suffer from acne and greasy skin.  i didnt know it was a blushligher so thats my fault. I wore with matte makeup expecting a regular liquid blish and was upset how greasy i looked as well as it accentuâting my acne bumps. Would definitely recommend to someone who loves a glowy look, not full glam, and a pigmented look. very vibrant in color. Just didnt like on myself. * This blush has an amazing pigment and glow combination. I get so many compliments on this blish. * the blush was pigmented but didn't blend well at all, I only used it once for my birthday and wanted to cry because it wouldn't blend. the color itself was splotchy and the glitter wouldn't move"

I loveee the color it changed to and the texture isn't too sticky or tacky! My only concern is that it doesn't last too long. After 30 minutes or so it starts to fade so you might need to reapply during the day. * I was excited to try this, but was sadly disappointed.  The color stayed the same almost clear color as in the bottle. No  change at all.  Just an oily look with no color.  Tried 2 bottles and neither changed color - at all! * I got this prodct on a whim expecting the color to be too dark for my very pale skin. I was pleasantly surpried by the sheer buildable finish, making it easy to control the pigment and prevent it from being too dark. It blends like a dream and layers perfectly with my powder blush on top. Lasts throughout the day. * This product is terrible, patchy and caused breakouts. Youre betted off rubbing mud on your face. * I'm always weary about products like this, when I've tried ph lip gloss i wasn't a fan of how pink it turned my lips, but this blush looks amazing, very natural, complimentary shade on my skin tone. Didn't need much, and blended well. * The product didn't apply evenly on my face. It felt greasy, like applying oil, and didn't last long at all."

Milani what happened :( 
Ugh Nude Kiss was reformulate or what?? It was this gorgeous soft pink, now it's more on the brown side. Why?? What's so sad is that they didn't even rename it, it's just a different shade. Please bring it back milani! Everyone wants a pink, and the old nude kiss was perfect ♡ * Best cream blush ive ever tried its so silky and glides on beautiful. Im waiting for more shades though theres not really any pink or hot pink shades * I'm questioning if maybe I got a defected one because the coral crush looks more like a pale peach, I took side by side photos of other coral blushes and noticeably different. * Very blendable the best cream blush I own. * I am an Autumn and was looking for a blush that would work well with my skin tone and not clash with the many brown-toned items I have in my wardrobe.  This blush is just the ticket.  It has buildable color and looks very natural when applied. * This formula is incredible and I honestly prefer it to my high end cream blushes (makeup by mario, haus labs). It applies so smoothly over foundation, and even on top of powders. The color is easily buildable. Nude kiss is the perfect blonzer shade. Milani come out with more shades of this - lavander or true hot pink!!!!!"
54,l'orÃ©al,lumi le liquid blush,pimprod2045480,2625628," * I wasn't able to use the product, but I think it's my problem and not the product's. I'll exchange it for powder or another format to try it out. * i was a elf liquid blush girly but i always had a problem with it removing my foundation sometimes. i tried this blush and omg!! the formula rivals high end brands ive tried and the shade Worth It is such a flattering nude pink. Gonna pick up another shade soon!! * This is a beautiful, sparkly everyday blush, and a little goes a long way. Just one dot is enough for fair to light skin. It's a great value for money because you don't need much product per use. The blush looks stunning in photos and adds plenty of shimmer. However, if you're not into sparkly finishes, this might not be for you. That said, the color itself is perfect for daily wear. * This is so pretty and lasts 8-9 hours when using a long lasting setting spray. The color is absolutely lovely but not super pigmented. I like a noticeable blush and use 4 dots on each cheek and then blend with a damp beauty sponge. * This is such a nice blush! A little goes a long way and it looks so glowy and natural. I don't wear much makeup anymore and when I do it's usually just a little blush and mascara so I can't judge how it sits on foundation, but it sits very nicely on bare skin. * Tried this on my hand in store and was so impressed, super glowy and loved the color. This is no doubt an amazing highlighter and I use it on my nose everyday, but if you have any other liquid product on underneath, if not carfuel this will take it off underneath and give it a splotchy area. I have had to redo my makeup several times. Good product by itself, not good with others * The first time I applied this, I put on too much. It goes a long, long way. One not-too-huge dot on my cheek provides enough product to cover the cheek apple. I dot in the middle and spread it by swirling around in a target shape, blending so there is no border. It's very easy to blend and the color is what I expected when applied."
55,chanel,joues contraste powder blush,pimprod2030016,2579895," * The blush doesnt have any pigment ots powdery and the amount of product you get is noth worth the price. * The texture is very soft with finely milled pearl similar to the Hourglass pressed powders. It has a ""lit from within"" look thats not going to emphasize textute. I got it in the color Jersey which is between a rose and warm nutmeg. The blush is a light wash of color that can be built up, but its not designed for vibrancy. Great for those who want a natural blush thats not shimmery or completely matte. I find the color and texture true to luxury makeup. It has longevity, and stays on my skin through an 8 hour work day. 

If youre not into subtle formulas then this isnt for you. There are more vibrant blushes that costs a fraction of the price. If you enjoy luxury makeup or like ultra milled baked powder then this could be an option. * I like this color and texture * I love this !! Its flirty not to bright not to dark it's perfect for those that have olive under tone! * While I wanted to love this blush, I found the coverage was minimal unless I use ALOT of product.  For the price, I won't buy again. * I love this blush! A nice natural glow feels amazing and last a long time. I will definitely buy again * Perfect everyday blush - give perfect amout of pigment and the packaging is very chic :)"

I got the hot pink shade, squeeze a tiny amount on the back of yohr hand then stipple brush to even distribute. Super buildable and doesnt get patchy!!! * Returned as unusable. Color was not very pigmented, but more importantly, this formula proved really problematic for my sensitive cheeks. * I thought this would be too bright when I first squeezed it out. Using just a little gives me a nice peachy flush that lasts all day. It's buildable too if I want a bit of a brighter color."
57,jane iredale,just kissed lip and cheek stain,pimprod2004095,2544987," * This the best multi use and at anytime very good quality and last for a long time shade rose is very nice light pink natural shade * This is very pretty on the lips and looks just like a clear lip balm on my lips. However as a cheek stain there is NO color at all. Even on the lips it is extremely faint. * This product goes so good with any kip shade- looked good on both me and my mom who have different lip colors! It smells so nice and goes on easy. Please put it in stores!!! 10/10🫶 * This is one of my faves for a lip moisturizer. I have extremely dry lips and this always works! * I suffer from dry lips. I also suffer from colorless lips. With other lip makeup products, before wear I would typically add a serum and a lotion to my lips before application(otherwise i would not have smooth lips for long). With this product, i still do a hydrating, easy absorbing serum but i dont even have to do that. In fact, it works better if i dont do all my lotions and potions beforehand. The color will really work its way into my lips and also hydrate way better. I will have to reapply a few times throughout the day but that is to be expected and not really a bother
. Goes on easily and smells wonderfully! * Just the right touch of color. Feels great and has a nice shine to it- but not greasy * I got a sample of this back in 2018… I loved it so much I bought the full-size and I haven't gone. It's probably not for everybody, but it is just the right amount of color and moisture for me and I get so many compliments on it. I'm pretty much always wear the red. It's not really a stain and it definitely isn't high gloss. I hate the sticky feeling of a glass and ""real"" lipstick it's just too hard to apply. This will always be my favorite."
58,hourglass,ambient lighting blush,pimprod2020426,2575935," * I recently got into Korean blush and just love that pale, barely there pink blush. It just gorgeous to me. This works perfect for that. I got the shade ethereal glow. I do not recommend this shade for medium to deep skin tones. You will just be disappointed. Dim diffusion is just as light. Like I have no windows in my room and thought there was no pigment payoff until I stepped into the daylight.😅 so definitely will be changing my makeup location or getting so actual beauty lights lol. * I have this blush in shade ""at night"" and it compliments my pale cool toned skin surprisingly well. * Hourglass finishing powders are amazing do I had high hopes for this blush but honestly it didn't give much color and isn't worth the $. Ultimately I return this. * I've used Mood Exposure as my daily blush for a long time; it's one of only two blushes I have ever 100% used up because I loved it so much. (The other was a limited edition from LORAC). Mood Exposure is a plummy brown color that just makes my fair to light skin look a bit sunkissed and blushing. It doesn't scream BLUSH. The mix of the ambient lighting powder also smoothes out my skintone visually and hide some fine lines. :) If you have a deeper skin tone, you'll need either a heavier hand or to try out a color like At Night or their magenta one for more color payoff. The full size blush lasted through 525 uses with a brush, so even if used every day it will last you over a year. I also used one as a topper to set cream blushes in place and that one lasted for many years! It may be expensive up front but wait for a coupon bc you will get a TON of uses out of this product. * I have most of the blushes. The newest that I purchased is At Night described as Brick Red. It's very pigmented and a beautiful flush of red on the cheeks. * I didn't understand the hype or the price point till I tried it myself. It's just so smooth and buttery and gives a beautiful finish on the cheeks * I've had this blush in diffused heat for years - it is my go-to. Looks a little dewy and very natural, easy to blend and wear, it also lasts a long time. I recently purchased At Night and it goes on much patchier, never had that issue with the other color. But it blends out ok. These are pretty pigmented IMO, but then I don't wear super heavy blush. It's good for someone who wants something more natural looking. A little pricy."
59,ulta beauty collection,too cheeky lip & cheek color stick,pimprod2015889,2556122," * Super cute little blush, perfect shade for everyday use! Love the finish, great for dry skin! Blends into skin very well without any patches, it also lasts pretty long on the skin for it being a cream blush! The packaging is also adorable! Great affordable option! * Blends easily, texture is fine, but too. Much. Glitter. I like the color to be on the strong side, so I layer on quite a bit. When I blend it out, the brush/sponge/my finger obviously lifts and diffuses the color, but the glitter isnt removed, so I just end up with like 80% color and 200% glitter. * Bought this as my first blush ever around a year ago. It's packaging and application is nice for beginners, as they can swipe it easily, though it does take a few swipes for pigment to show. And about the pigment, its average, takes a good amount to show up.
For the cheeks, it's a good blush, but for the lips I would not recommend, as it sinks into the fine lines, and looks patchey.
But I also haven't seen any irritation for it, as someone with sensitive skin.
Overall it's an okay blush. 🩷 * This is the fourth cheek and lip contour stick I have used, first one I've sampled. Being that it is Ulta brand and not a name brand I had my suspicions. To be completely honest I love it!!  the texture is much less creamy than say Milk make up or Mario's. However, I've found that I use much less of it because I am dotting it on to my contour lines rather than gliding (making dots on my cheeks vs actual lines to blend). A little goes a long way, and often times I'll blend then build then blend, if I'm wanting a more dramatic look. *If you're wanting to achieve a more defined/dramatic look I highly recommend not going in heavy with this one as it seems like it would be hard to blend in due to it's thickness. I've achieved some great looks by just building up to the pigment I'm looking for. * I've tried expensive cream blushes and this ULTA cream blush has been better than them all. I also use it for an eye shadow on the upper part of my eyelids also. It really makes my eyes look opened up. Also it's a fantastic price! * Works ok for lip but I did not like it for cheek color/blush. Did not blend well for me * I got this in the shade Debut. Its a beautiful rich color that you can blend out nicely on the cheeks.  Grear buy for the price. Only thing i dont like is that tony plastic cover that keeps it from getting dried out, i drop it every time and its messy."

The color payoff isn't very pigmented at all. I would not recommend * Honestly i realky loved the product soo much also it lasted me a long time to be honest . Its soo goood that i will be repurchasing it. * Let me start off by saying that this blush is such a beautiful color and is quite pigmented. I was looking for a dewy, coral blush for the summer that doesnt break me out and this was exactly what i was looking for. just be careful and i recommend that if you're wearing it with foundation, apply it with a brush instead of directly on your face to prevent disturbing with foundation and from having too much pigment in one place. As long as i prep my skin good, this blush has no problem staying on all day. overall this is a great blush * Great color, smooth application * I'm a deep Summer and this shade is perfect * The beauty consultant that helped was right on with color match. It's a great product and much easier to use than powder."

62,colourpop,pokÃ©mon x colourpop instant crush cream blush,pimprod2045285,2624663," * I just ordered another Electroball Colourpop Pokémon blush because it is the most perfect flush of believable sheer color. I apply it with a dry sponge that has a rounded but somewhat flat bottom so my fingers dont get stained. This summer I'm all about the hot pink coral lips and cheeks because it imparts a vibrant and lively look to the face and I can keep the eye look simple with just liner, mascara and a neutral eyeshadow from lid to brow or none at all. There used to be a MAC cream color base called Virgin Isle and I love Electroball way more than that. I ordered the violet one this time around and hopefully it'll look just as fabulous. I'm also going to try it as an eyeshadow and see if it makes my brown eyes pop. * My NB son, 15, wanted to do his face (first time) to go to drag show and loves Pokémon. He's a perfect match to the palest Morphe foundation. I was afraid the cherry red Pikachu blush would be too intense, but it imparted the loveliest cherry red flush and I built it up till it was just amazing.  Now I want my own, his cousin teased that she was going to steal all his Pokémon makeup after seeing how beautiful it looked on. * I got the light pink blush. It is so oily and completely sheer. Trying to rub it into the skin is like rubbing lip balm. 

Tower 28 cream blush is so much more pigmented and not oily. I have no idea why all the products from this launch are so bad, but they are. * I got all three and it seems like its a cream to powder matte finish. They are all sheer and very builable.  I would use a smaller blush brush to get color pay off. Very pretty and natural on the skin. * I bought the shade electro ball and its gorgeous! It blends out super easily and the color lasts all day with no issues. It's a great cream blush."

Disappointing for the price point. * I just love these multi sticks! Great for quick touch of color before running out the door. Slightly sheer, but buildable, give a light flush of color. Only wish they lasted longer. If going for all day color, I need to reapply. * I love this as a blush! So cheap and affordable, easy to apply and blend out (I use a short dense brush), and perfect for beginners! I don't love it for my lips because it is a bit drying but other than that I highly recomend! * The blush stick is a great color and goes on smoothly. I've never been disappointed in a product from Elf! * Really nice glow, but a little more sheer than I usually use. But it layers really nice! * I think if i warmed this up on my hand first it would work better, but i want stick formula products to work when directly applied to the face.

It appears the consistency or formula is different. The lighter bronzer shade was a lot cooler, and was a lot easier to blend out. This looks muddy. But the pink highlight is my asbolute favorite. I wish they sold just the highlight shade by itself.. * This palette is great for everyday! It blends great and lasts forever. * This is my favorite face palette!! I'm obsessed with it I've used it for years I always repurchase. The bronzers and blushes blend so nicely, and all the colors go perfect with my skin tone. I will say I'm not super pale and fair skinned though, to me this is more for medium tan girlies * I love this pallet. I have been looking at this for awhile now and wasn't sure which color to order but I'm glad I went with this one. I think the others would have been too dark. The contour is slightly darker but I can easily use one of the lighter bronzers for contouring. * I found this to be too warm to use for bronzers/ contour. looks very orange and yellow. the blush and highlight are okay though. * Beautiful"

I have goofy combo skin and some fine lines-this blush goes on so nicely and it doesn't make my face look more oily in my t zone and it does not settle into drier skin and lines! Absolutely worth the price and I hope they never stop making this blush! * I love this and the color but it used to have spf in it. Now it's just a regular blush. I noticed the brand has been doing away with the products being spf. Which is a shame since that's the reason I stocked up in early spring. Now since it has no spf, I am in no hurry to purchase. I still miss there spf gloss that used to be this color. * I've been using this blush for over a year now and I love this stuff!  I have dry, flaky skin and using powder blush accentuates my dry spots. This blush gives me a beautiful glow with some added moisture.  Long lasting and beautiful! I really think this blush would be good for all skin types especially dryer skin, a little goes a long way! * I love this blush in the summer when I need a bit of a boost on my cheeks for going out after doing some sun loving activities. I have sensitive skin, so when working outdoors I can only have sunscreen. Due to the sunscreen in the blush this helps being able to put some neutral makeup on for work without the risk of my face getting sunburned with regular makeup. I love the neutral color. Perricone MD used to sell an spf lipgloss in this color as well, I wish they brought back the lipgloss as it smelled great and worked fantastically. * CONS 
1. This blush burnt my skin. 
I applied the blush almost daily for several months. 2 weeks ago the skin on my cheek bones where the blush touched (in the exact shape I apply my blush) got a terrible allergic reaction: painful, red, extremely dry and bumpy. It has been several days of using soothing skincare, and the irritation is still there, although very slowly subsiding. 
2. As other reviewershave mentioned, the cap cracks easily when you screw the top closed. 

PROS 
The shade is buildable and starts very subtle. I have light skin, cool undertone, and this blush looked beautiful. * i only used this once or twice. i screwed the cap on too tight one time and the lid breaks and the stopper sank to the bottom. please replace the cheap plastic with metal. * I love the color of this blush and it blends beautifully. Big drawback though is the packaging. The lid completely cracked when I tightened it. I love this blush but now I can't take it anywhere. Please fix this packaging!!!!!"
66,bareminerals,loose mineral blush,pimprod2034497,2599467," * Mostly for glittery shiny finish not a pigmented color. Not for my skin at least. * Golden gate use to be my go to blush but since they reformulated, It breaks me out. Thankfully warmth is still the same or I would have to look for another brand. * I still haven't received the products yet. It's taking too long. * Looking for Warnth blush powder * Bare Minerals products are the a source best! The only product on the market that doesnt break out my face! 100% recommend. * I love it * This is one of my favorite blush formulas! 

Hint is a medium, warm berry that is super shimmery (not glittery). Works for most skin tones. Even if the color doesn't show, it makes for the perfect, skin-like, glowy highlight.

Beauty is the most matte of the 3. It is still a little shimmery and it looks very similar to Hint (just a smidge warmer) without the shimmer on me. It is the most pigmented on the 3 so I think it can work for all skin tones.

Vintage Peach is the most glittery and lightest of the three. I was worried it would be bright orange but it is not, it is a very light peach color. It might be ashy on some skin tones and it is the least friendly for acne and skin texture.

Overall while it is a bit of a hassle to use it is gorgeous, doesn't harm your skin, blendable, and lasts about 8 hours on me."
67,nyx professional makeup,buttermelt pressed powder blush,pimprod2045333,2624632," * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I'm obsessed with Nick's Buttermilk Blush! First of all, it smells amazing—like, I legit want to sniff it all day. The pigmentation is on point, so you definitely get your money's worth. I got the shade Filling Butta (also says Shimmering Terracotta on the packaging), and I am so here for it.

Even though it's technically a blush, it actually works beautifully as a bronzer, which is exactly how I've been using it. The shimmer in it gives such a warm, glowing finish, and it's perfect for adding a subtle sun-kissed vibe. Honestly, it does its job—and does it well. All-in-all, it's a fun, versatile product that I'd recommend if you want something that doubles as blush and bronzer * I've bought two of the Buttermelt blushes and the colors of the makeup don't match the case.  I bought Butta Together and For the Butta.  Both look too artificial and vivid on my skin, not natural at all.  FtB is not soft rose, it's bright magenta. * Very pigmented * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] love the bronzers but I don't think the blushes ade for me , I have dry skin on my cheeks so that tends to emphasize my pores and my skin a lot , it's really pretty it's just the shimmer isn't my thing in thw blushes . packaging is nice and sleek , pigment is there 10/10 and no scent , it's an amazing product just not for me . * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I've just started becoming a blush girl, and I must say this blush is amazing. It's a blush that's kind of mixed with a highlighter so it's kind of like a two and one and I'm obsessed. * This blush is absolutely stunning! I have the shade Butta Together and I love the baby pink tones! It blends so seamlessly and stays in place. It also gives the most beautiful shine effect. * This will last a long time especially since I accidentally bought 2 but its great color and easy to work with."

The shade pink really adopt the skin tone you have… This is the pink blush on I am looking for…I think it is similar to milani's luminoso shade…without the shimmer…I just think so * I fell in love with the Lilac Pink color. It looks beautiful with my complexion. The packaging is luxe so it gives me a little joy to see it among the more budget friendly makeup I normally use. The blush has a faint fruity scent which is so delightful when applying but fades quickly so is not bothersome. So initially I 100% fell in love with this blush. But after only a few weeks of use it developed hardpan and I couldn't get any product on my brush. Scraping the blush or using tape to remove the upper layer is helping get to the good product but it quickly hardpans again. I should be able to get through the blush but won't repurchase. For that kind of money I expected much better performance. I don't have this problem with the drugstore blushes I use. * I have the lavender shade & you literally have to dig in the product for any pigment. I use this on days where im trying to look like im wearing no makeup. Definitely not worth the price. * I have the lavender shade & you literally have to dig in the product for any pigment.

I'm hoping it will look great during the summer when I have more color as I chose the cherry shade which is absolutely gorgeous. * I love this blush! I use it over my YSL liquid blush abd the combo is unreal. Please bring back the lavender shade! It's sooo pretty!

I have very fair skin, and this creates a healthy pink flush rather than advertising fake paint on my face. Love it! * I am not a blush person so it was with caution that I purchased this. I now have 4. To be clear, I like the blush to look like its coming from my actual skin, underneath. I also found the Bobbi Brown blush brush to create this look perfectly while depositing color well. I have had no skin irritation and have early mature dry-combination skin. It stays on all day too. * Dior blush lasts 3 times as long as my Nars blush. The little extra you spend initially is worth it. You won't need a replacement for a long time. It also won't break up on you when it gets low. Nars does that to me almost every time. I love this product. It actually saves you money and the colors are beautiful. Now lets hope they don't get greedy, change the formula and mess it up. * I have the newer formulation in ""Nude Look"", and I love it.  I love how buildable it is.  For no makeup, makeup days it's great because you can make it be more natural looking.  I read a bad review on this page and said it was patchy?  It's not patchy on me at all.  Maybe because of different make-up prep?  I love this blush and definitely would recommend.  Yes, it is pricey, but if you want to splurge on a good blush…. This would be a great option. * I hate blushes that are so pigmented or just don't blend well meaning they aren't natural but this is so cute!

Smooth, and makes my skin glow with a soft plump. I use this product every day. * This blush is perfect. I have been searching for the perfect shade and this is it. * I have been on the ""match your lips to your cheeks"" trend since before it became popular. I do this by simply using the blush as normal on my cheeks and then dabbing some on the center of my lips for a natural tint. I have never had a problem with this before and, as you can imagine, this is not a new concept to me. I used this blush for the first time yesterday and my cheeks looked like absolute perfection! That is the ONLY reason this is not getting a one star. When I applied it to my lips, I noticed that it burned, which was something that definitely doesn't happen when applied to cheeks. I remembered it was a plumping blush so I put it out of mind. It is 24 hours later and the pain is horrible. I am worried that in some way it has caused a chemical burn (something that isn't new to me as I work in a lab). I'm attaching a picture as of this morning with no makeup for reference. I beg you, PLEASE hear this story when you are considering buying this blush. * I got this as a sample and ended up buying a full size product. I love how this blends for me.

78,kvd beauty,good apple blush balm duo,pimprod2043903,2621127," * I've always been a fan of KVD even before she sold it and the products have NOT changed expectations. These blush balms are similar the foundation formula only they don't oxidize the way the foundation does so the color is very true to the pan/swatch. I own 3/4 only because I don't wear the shades in Elusive Orchard. With that being said, I'm obsessed with all the other shade's formula, product, packaging, and pigment. A little goes a longggg way with these, so don't let the amount of product make you skeptical on purchasing. These wear well alone and over liquid or powder, are easy to blend, and buildable. Get it and love it, I promise! * I really wanted to like this blush as I have been on tje lookout for a highly pigmented cream blush. Unfortunately, i was disapointed by the KVD blush balm duo's performance and don't believe it is worth the expensive price point. 

This product is not nearly as blendable as i would typically prefer my cream products to be. It sort of has a cream-to-powder feel due to how quickly the product dries / mattifies during application. I have to really work to get any kind of transition of color because the pigmentation is so strong, and it is incredibly hard to blend with or on top of other products without triggering the following issue; product settling into the pores and accentuates the skins natural texture as opposed to any kind of blurring effect. Incredibly difficult to blend as a result, and despite my best efforts, maybe 75% of the time it creates the appearance of strawberry skin on a previously flawless base due to how the product settles on the face :/ overall, i would not say that this KVD blush balm duo was worth the cost nor could I recommend its formula to anyone who migbt be interested in a blush balm * Ohmygod im gonna BUST. This blush is the best purple blush ever made. * Very pigmented, but also very bendable. Layers well over liquid foundation, or under powder for a less intense look. A bit of a learning curve at first but very worth it imo. * doesn't blend as well as other brands. color pay off is fine for an hour or two and then completely disappears. will not repurchase. * This blush is amazing! Let me start by saying I work 12 hour night shift and some nights I'm very physically active, leaving me with patchy/streaked or zero face makeup at the end of my shift. I live in the South and our air conditioning went out at work on a 93° day. The thermostat read 79° at it's lowest indoor temp that day and after a very sweaty 12 hours of work, this blush was still holding strong! The pigment is pigment-ing (seriously the most color rich blush I've ever used) and a little goes a very long way but it's creamy and still easy to blend out. The balm like consistency is great for dry skin, doesn't settle into creases, lasts forever. Definitely my new favorite blush * Im so happy kvd 💋 I loved its amazing shade and very pigmented stays all day"
79,pur,silky tint creamy multitasking stick,pimprod2044097,2620462," * The color is actually really pretty and love that my lipstick matches my blush and it's all in one.  I also like that is matt and that if I want to gloss it up I could just add on a gloss, or keep it matte.  Most importantly comes from a brand that is natural and healthy. * As a clean beauty enthusiast, I eagerly took the opportunity to try the Silky Tint multitasking stick. I'm new to the brand, but I love these easy two-in-ones that eliminate the guesswork of coordinating lip colors with blush. 

Lately, I've been into skincare makeup, and this stick is pure magic. Not only is it serum-based and infused with peptides, but it also blends into the skin beautifully. You can apply it with a brush or your fingertips, and I found that both methods are equally effective. 

Although I usually stick to warm-toned blushes, Sparkling Rose is a neutral shade that would look great on anyone's skin tone. I expected it to be sheer, but it is packed with pigment. I plan to wear this shade for a Mother's Day brunch, and I'm excited to see how it complements my look.

I used to be obsessed with a similar clean beauty color stick, but I had to keep the inner seal on to prevent it from drying out. Then, when it was reformulated, the formula changed to a more sheer version, which I didn't love as much because I prefer more pigment in my products. I also like the grippy texture of this stick, as it won't slide off my face in the heat.

The lid snaps tightly closed, so you don't have to worry about it popping open in your bag. I added a lip liner, and it wears just as well as a lipstick. I stick to an 80/20 rule, trying to keep my makeup choices more on the clean beauty side, and this is a wonderful addition to my collection—perfect for adding to a Mother's Day gift basket or for the upcoming wedding season. 

It has a dreamy formula and a romantic shade. Best of all, it doesn't contain any harmful toxins or ingredients. I'm enthusiastically looking forward to trying more from this brand! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This was a nice blush. Overall it wasn't my favorite formula- it would occasionally lift my foundation underneath but with patience and a brush application it was nice. * Product goes on smooth but my skin is too tan to see it and I'm not that dark. It completely disappeared on my cheeks. Its not easy to put on your lips if you have a defined cupids bow. * I like this cream stick blush lip color,  it's creamy and a nice natural color and it has staying power.  I like that it does last and last all day long, and it looks very natural.  I also love this as lip color. * This cream blush stick/ lipstick is a great versatile product. It's is a beautiful pink color and it really works well on cheeks or lips. The only issue is that it can be a little greasy and heavy on the cheeks, but it's a great product to carry that works in different applications. * The whole line is sadly so drying"

It is a beautiful, glowy color that lasts.  The packaging is a different story.  It is hard to control how much product comes out of the tube and I often end up with more than I need.  It also seems like it will be hard to get all of the product out to use it all.  I have never gone through a product so quickly due to waste.  I would buy again only if they improve the packaging. * I got a sample of this and was super hopeful, but, sadly, this is just a big no for me. so for reference I'm 35yo female fair, combo skin. I found this to not really dry down it remained sticky which I did not like. I also did not like the glitter in this. def not for me, esp at my age. the color was nice, and it was rich, but I'm missing how this is also a bronzer.. just felt like pigmented blush. overall, don't like it and it's nothing unique. I would not recommend. * Very easy to use, great color, blends well and looks natural!  I've repurchased a couple times now and can't see myself ever going to a different blush product now. * I keep getting complements on this blush! I have a fair complexion with a neutral undertone and I purchased a kiss of pink. I love it! * Wanted to love it but was disappointed.The ""pink glow"" shade barely shows up. The tube is also not very full. * It's not heavy and appears as a highlight.  So far I like it.  Having been using it long * For now doing a 4 star. Bought this because I wanted to see if I liked it better then the power blush. I am 65 so moisture products needed. I like the way it looks but didn't have a proper brush to apply and trying to do with finger and sponge just doesnt work. I will buy a brush and try that. the powder brush does not work for liquid blush."

It just takes the tiniest pump to get the amount needed. * It gives a beautiful no makeup flush and also a glow without shimmer.  I got light pink.  I was afraid it would be too light, but it isn't.  It's a little finicky to use, but I quickly figured out my ideal way to apply it where it shows up, looks natural.

I actually apply it with my hands.  I apply one pump to the back of my hand and mix the pigments into the suspension.  I dip my fingers into it and tap my fingers together so its evenly distributed between my fingers.  Then I tap it onto my cheeks and temples sort of like when mckauley culkin put on after shave in home alone.  It is very cooling, and feels good going on.  The end result is a no makeup flush.  Personally, that's what I wanted.  I wanted the look of just being outside with a flush, not a blushed look.  Love this. * Im a blush lover and i have several from different brands (Haus Labs, Febty, Mac, Huda, Hourglass, Nars, etc) but for my birthday I decided to buy the one from Chanel

The case is cute and works great and the product lasts a long time even with daily use! * Love this hybrid gel cheek duo * I purchased the Grapefruit and Caramel color. I tried it out with my fingers and a brush.

The good;
-Pretty colors. They swatch mat but do blend out sheer and become part of the skin. 
-Elegant formulation with a creamy and light feel on the skin. 
-Easy to use, compact and portable.
-No discernable scent. 
-Neither the bronzer nor the blush have any glowy particles. 

The not so good;
-I am fair but cool toned and ALL the colors are warm on me. Why Stila, why? 
-Once applied the blush and bronzer become sheer and the colors disappear as they blend in. 
-I had to do multiple layers before I could truly see any color payoff.
I am tempted to purchase a darker color combination just so it would show up. 

Overall this is a clever, very convenient, and  portable product. Perhaps great for on the go touchups. But it is so sheer and blends out on my skin so much that there is virtually nothing left."

Can't believe I waited so long to try this formula! Creamy long lasting & product forever! * I love this blush! I feel like it is very long lasting. It is very pigmented so a little goes a long way. Layered with my powder blush beautifully. * I don't reach for any other blush anymore... this is insanely easy to use. Like I usually just use my fingers to grab the product and work it into where I want it to go! Seriously, it melts into the skin. Kinda have to work fast before it dries, but once you work it into the skin- it has a flawless blurring butter finish. I set it with any blurring powder blush and setting spray for GLAM days, but for everyday wear it lasts all day w/o setting spray or powder. Dewy, skin finish. I am obsessed and will be grabbing again. * I really wanted to like this product but after an hour or so it looks really patchy on the skin and breakd down quickly"
88,bobbi brown,blush,pimprod2042919,2615813," * I love this blush - it is the best! I only buy this and when they are out, I use what I have sparingly until it comes back in. Only use one color, love it!!!!!!!! * Loved this until it broke, i hadnt used it much and it was never dropped but it broke apart and i had to throw it away. Same thing happened with the bronzer * Please bring back the color 'Pretty Pink'. It was the perfect blush! * Excellent service.  Easy to order.  Shipping was on time. * I am a blush girly and have over 50+ blushes to choose from and daily I reach for this one! It applies evenly & has high pigment that actually lasts. I'm tan so finding a blush in this shade range that actually shows up and stays is hard to come by!! I lucked out and got it for a pretty reasonable price, however, I've already purchased 2 additional shades lol. This formula is A1! * Needed new blush after Clinique discontinued my all time favorite which was the cheek Pop, I am not a blush girl at all, I use a fluffy brush and this goes on beautifully set with spray and out the door… with eye shadow and lipstick low key minimal look… love it! 
I have super sensitive skin and this has no talc! Yay! * I was so glad that Bobbi Brown removed the lanolin from their blushes, but disappointed to see that they now contain coconut oil, which is pore clogging.  I know Bobbi Brown has dry skin, and I feel like all her products are made with dry skinned people in mind, but do not work well for people with oily or acne prone skin.  It's too bad, because I have had back luck with several of her products (her tinted moisturizer contains petrolatum, and clogged my pores).  Please make products that anyone can use!"
89,morphe,8r that's rich complexion pro face palette,pimprod2016718,2567618," * I have not used all the colors yet, but the ones that I have used look good on me. I'm  a medium brown skinned, 50 year old . These colors compliment me both ways * This is my 2nd time purchasing this palette & it's everything.  I especially like to blend the gold bronze and the pink bronze together. I use the morphe fan brush to apply and the rose colored highlighter brush to blend and it blends the highlighter and bronzer perfectly. Since I moved this product isn't sold in store so I had to order...that's the only thing that I don't like is that it's not sold in MN Ulta stores. * This palette is exactly what I was looking for, the colors are very pigmented, but it is a little hard to blend out well. The colors are fantastic; it has contour, blush, highlighter. Also, I use them as eye shadow. * This palette is horrible! The contour and highlighter do not blend easily at all. The highlighter has very chunky glitter. If I could give it no stars I would. * The blushes in this palette are soo pretty. The bronzers are warm and beautiful as well. Perfect for your kit. * This product is goood!!! I'm an MUA... and it's good for women of color * I have been looking for a bronzer for my deep complexion and wanted to try out a few shades before committing. This palette lets me do that. Both bronzers work nicely for me so I blend both. The contour is super pigmented so go in with a light hand. The matte blush shade is super pretty and I love the highlighters. Haven't tried the brightening powder yet. Would purchase again once I hit pan."
90,essence,pure nude baked blush,pimprod2037419,2603025," * Essence Baked Blushes are the best. You can wear them sheer or build up, I own a couple of them and tend to reach for these more than my high end blushes. * This is a great product considering the price, I would probably buy it again. The color looks great on. It's shear enough not to be to bright. * I wear this blush daily and I love the color it's just the right pink! 😊 * This blush from Essence is my new favorite. Blends like a dream, great color payoff, isn't patchy, gorgeous color. I will be purchasing more. * bought this for a wedding i was attending. I layered it over a cream lilac blush and it was perfect for fair to medium fair skin * ITS SUPER PIGMENTED AND A LITTLE GOES A LONGG WAY. ITS THE BEST DRUGSTORE POWDER BLUSH THAT I HAVE EVER TRIED. I WOULD IMMEDIATELY REPURCHASE!! * The perfect touch of sparkle over the color I picked out"
91,nars,blush,pimprod2044741,2621262," * I bought this on sale and I'm happy so far with purchase. I'm pretty pale and this looks nice, doesn't take too much and I like that it has a slight bit of shimmer so my skin looks brighter and healthier. I think it will last me awhile too. * I was so disappointed when I received this blush. It was NOT like the same product I'd been using. Thinking that maybe I'd ordered the wrong color, I went into Ulta and they told me the formula had been changed!!! Not nearly as pretty. I returned for refund. * Very elegant and mature color * I was a little hesitant when I first purchased this. I grabbed this blush during the 21 day beauty sale. I have worn the traditional orgasm blush for years which has shimmer and IMO, it is very sheer and gorgeous . I wanted to try the matte version. It does appear to look a lot darker and almost like it is a totally different color compared to the  orgasm original w/ shimmer, in the pan. Once u put on the blush it is really pretty. Be warned, a little of the matte goes a long way, whereas the original I applied a lot more. I am very pale and this will be great to switch up for fall winter months and spring summer go back to the shimmer version. NARS has the best blush. * First time purchasing anything from NARS. This blush is everything. I totally love it. * Flawless formula, both matte and glowy shades. Velvety, effortlessly blendable, and perfect for any skin type * Color, while complementary to my skin tone, is not as vibrant or long lasting as my other NARS. It also seems to have a new ingredient that irritates my skin. With how expensive NARS is, likely won't purchase again."
92,anastasia beverly hills,"face palette - all in one bronzer, highlight, blush",pimprod2024358,2576830," * I bought this for traveling and was pleasantly surprised.  The bronzer is way more pigmented than expected-a little goes a long way.  Blush too but the overall end color is fab.  Highly recommend for a medium skin tone! * It's really hard to find warm leaning products that aren't too deep, but I found Italian summer is super flattering on my complexion. If you lean cool, this palette might not be the right one for you as it's very gold-based in person, more so than the online pictures. I dropped one star because there is glitter in the blush+highlighter. It blends in pretty well but would prefer more of a natural shimmer. Overall a great three in one palette for a minimalist like me. * Although my skin tone is on the lighter side, I opted for the Costa Rica palette because I preferred the blush color. The bronzer is thankfully not too dark for me and blends nicely. I'm not a fan of the highlighter color, though. It's way too bronzed. I have the ABH highlighter palette so I just use that, but I was trying to find an all-in-one face palette. I likely won't repurchase, but it is an ok palette if you like all the colors. * I love this palette. I have pale skin, so I bought Italian summer. Great pigments and great packaging. * You need this it's truly REMARKABLE ITS SO NICE MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR COLOR THOU.This will get you many to ask what you're wearing and where you get it.  The inside and out it's truly worth all the coins. I just hope it last so I'm able to get a medium one too. This is my go to and will be for a long time. Loving this. * The blush and bronzer are pretty, but the highlight is so powdery, it has not shine at all. Thinking about returning. * It's beyond a different shade in person then here. Beyond disappointed since most store aren't taking exchanges :("
93,winky lux,cheeky rose liquid blush,pimprod2042625,2618682," * This is a beautiful blush. It is very blendable and fool proof because of it's sheerness, which is why this got 4 stars not 5. If you like blush, you really need to build this up which does mean you would use up the product faster. I wish it had more pigment, but the color is gorgeous. * This product stays on the skin in a soft blended way. It makes my skin look naturally rosey! * I would love this blush if only it didn't leak all the time… regardless of how i store it, it leaks all over the place. * I absolutely love this blush! A little goes a long way and it lasts all day. It comes in great colors and is my favorite of all the blushes I've tried. * I loveee * This blush applies easily, blends well, looks beautiful, and is within my price range. The packaging is lovely and it fits in my purse. It's fab! * First off, I really love this formula. It's highly pigmented and blends easily into the skin. However, the packaging has some issues. There is a lot of product buildup around the rim that I have to wipe off with a tissue every second or third time I use this blush. It's just disappointing to lose that much product especially since I really like it."

95,too faced,cloud crush blurring blush,pimprod2036986,2603639," * In the pan, it looks like a chalky light mauve, which had me doubting it would work on me and confused thinking I received the wrong order… but on the skin its a perfect, natural, warm pink flush. It looks just like the promo photos. It's my second Cloud Blush from Too Faced, and I can confidently say, it's my favorite powder blush. The colors stay throughout the day regardless of humidity & oil, and the blurring is real. Even when I dont wear any type of base like primer, foundation, or concealer on my cheeks, it literally erases my pores and melts into my skin like a cream. I also have Tequila Sunset, and that color is just incredible. Its the perfect punchy coral color for literally any occasion. I was wearing it as my daily blush until I recently bought Velvet Crush for some variety. * I bought this blush mainly because the packaging was super cute but when I first tried it out it was such a beautiful experience! It's very pigmented and blends easily. * Im in love with this blush. Getting other colors. Its the best blush Ive ever used. It blurs/softens and very pigmented. The only thing i dont like is that the compact is difficult to open especially if you have long nails. * Love this product !!! Its pigmented!! Can blend easily and it last all
Day long * I love this blush, pretty packaging, great pigment, lightweight, smells soft and sweet. * This blush is super pigmented and beautiful on the skin it has a matte blurring finish * love"
96,natasha denona,my mini dream glow blush,pimprod2042602,2620729," * I don't like to spend a whole lot of time on my make up . I always run out of time so anything that is quick and looks great on is a game changer for me. * I love it ! Blends easily and great for travel. * I loved the way the color looked on my skin.  I did not break out from this blush. * I ordered this small size to try and I love it! I have finally found a blush that I love and looks perfect on me. When I am done with this mini, I will order the larger, regular size compact. Sometimes I like to take my brush and get all 3 colors on it and use it like that and it gives a pretty glow to the look. It stays put all day and I recommend it! 5 stars! ⭐️ * I absolutely adore this product and it's versatility. It's my go-to travel blush. I pair it with Rare Beauty 'Hope' liquid blush or wear it on its own.  I love that it has three shades to create a custom look on my cheeks, but when I need to move fast, I use all of them all at once for a pretty soft glow blush.  I view its small size as a complete bonus.  It's absolutely perfect. * I love this color! I had been wearing the color mocha from Chanel for years and years and out of nowhere they discontinued it and nobody knew why because it was such a unique color then I switched to our oasis also discontinued so I found this and I feel like it's very similar I'm just wondering if it's going to stay on and where as well as the other two did! I really hope this doesn't get discontinued. I'm gonna buy a few more and I wish it came in a larger size. I do not feel like the her eyeshadows wewr well even w primer so im crossing my fingers that the blush stays on better! * As a ND collector this one was a miss for me, although the mini pallet in this series was great. This pulled really orange on my fair cool pink undertone. I also found the size of it impractical for having 2 blushes and a highlighter in it. I knew it was mini and that wasn't the issue, I just think it could/should have been JUST blush and it would have been great. But that highlight mixed in wasn't it for me."
97,nudestix,nudescreen blush tint spf 30,pimprod2043960,2620585," * This appears nice and natural, and counters potential risk of removing standard sun protection while applying blush. 
I appreciate how the application technique(s) this promotes appear(s) to support alpha hygeine. * I have both Sunny Sweet cheeks a muted warm pink and Strawberry Sunburst a warm red. I prefer these over the Ciele Liquid SPF50 blushes for everyday. The finish reminds me of the Original Benefit Benetint with the translucent wash of color that still allows you to see the skin underneath. Love that they have broad spectrum sun protection since the cheekbone area is exposed to a lot of sun and prone to hyperpigmentation. In the pic Sunny sweet cheeks is the top blush shade and strawberry sunburst is the 4th. Ciele Kirsten and Elodie are 2nd and 3rd from the top. * So i bought this blush when  it first came ouy and fell in love with it, all of a sudden it gave the worst and most painful  allergic reaction, has this happened to anyone else? * I love this is an spf blush! I have never really considered myself a blush person but it's so perfect for pool days where I just put on my turned sunscreen and this blush and I feel so put together * I normally wear spf of 50 + and I tryed the nudestix nudescreen tint 30 spf on coral pink, the next day I woke ip with a really bad sun burn on my chicks, I feel that I aged 10 years, I hate this product, I never write a bad review but this damaged my skin so much Im so angry…..! * I normally wear spf 50 + and on top I apllied NUDESTIX NUDESCREEN BLUSH TINT 30, blush teinte FPS 30, and woke up with a really bad sun burn where I applied the blush, this dammaged my skin so much I am very upset…….! * I normally use sunscreen 50 + and on top applied the NUDESTIX NUDESCREEN BLUSH TINT 30, blush teinte FPS 30, and the next day I woke up with my chicks where I applied the Nudestix Blush, all red and tender, it is a really bad sun burn. I hate this product 😡 sun burn is really bad for the skin !!! I feel that my face is hoig to age 10 year after this 😩"
98,physicians formula,butter dream team palette,pimprod2030858,2593962," * I can 5 of the 6 shades on my face. Bronze highlighter is too much for my face but can use on eyes. The lighter blush is a soft brush of color, the darker one is heavily pigmented.  Nice Monoi scent that fades after application if you are sensitive. * Only sold online, but arrived broken 🙃 * I LOVE this palette and constantly find myself reaching for it whenever I am doing my makeup. Sometimes I struggle with dry skin due to acne treatment so makeup can look a bit patchy, but the formula for this product is amazing! They are buttery and apply smoothly. I am barely starting to run out so I will definitely be buying again. Highly recommend for any makeup beginners looking for a reliable, safe option * I used this pallete for my wedding day makeup, it looked so good! I love this palette so much i just repurchased it and it's my go to for so many looks! * This is the best powder formula in the world! It definitely deserves all money I paid! Strongly recommended * In details it boasts that the mineral wear line is talc free, but the first ingredient listed : TALC! 🙄🥴🤥 * For me, this is perfect!! I love the blush and highlighter for my complexion. I am an olive complexion with yellow undertones, and struggle to find the right ""shade"" for my skin tone. For me, this is perfect! I am very happy with this purchase and the value I paid."
99,polite society,polite pops powder blush stick,pimprod2044285,2620617," * I received this blush in the color Sydney, and I absolutely love it! I have olive toned Asian American skin that tans easily in the summer. It applies effortlessly without the need for an additional applicator or brush. It applies with the smoothness of a cream with an immediate powder like finish. It applies lightly with the first application which makes it easy to build with additional applications for richer color if needed. I love it! Lasts all day! * I got this for my daughter, for her birthday. It was a brands that was part of a sale/deal. So the price was amazing. She had never tried this brand before and it became a favorite product immediately. She wants more colors. I will say they are very small/compact, but a little does go a long way!   Perfect for on the go/travel makeup bags. If they have any deals, GRAB Some! * Recommanded product * This formula is so dry. I also have very dry skin so unfortunately that's not a winning combo. I tried warming it up on the back of my hand too. If you have oily skin maybe this will work? The product also fell out of the packaging the 3rd time I tried using it. All in all would not recommend, 2 stars because the shade was what I expected. * I already have London and Paris. But I really wanted Los Angeles, which is a real pink pink, to add to my collection. This was perfect I got it on a sale 50% off, yay! I found you need a little practice getting this on. I learned not to use a brush with it or it will come off. Best thing to do roll it on your face where you want it and tap on it to blend it in. I put it on a clean moisturized face and it last all day. * Love the color Paris for a my light to fair completion. It seems a little dry, but it doesn't affect the use. I still get great color payoff and silky smooth blending. Love it & wish I bought two when it was on sale. Also rates well on Yuka! * I picked the color Sydney and it is perfect for my skin tone. This goes on so we'll I almost don't have to blend it in!"
100,essence,baby got blush,pimprod2037387,2603000," * I think it last long than morphes blush pallets they have with the cream and shimmer. Easy to buld up. Good for acne prone slin according to yuka and my cystic acne hasnt flared because of the product * I use this every single day and a little goes a long way. I honestly get mad at myself when I swipe it across my hand 2-3 times before applying with a brush and end up wasting product because I didn't even need to apply a lot! * I wish that there was a little bit darker pink tone to the blush.  And that it was easier to blend in after applying since I put this on after my foundation and powder. * Smells good and nice feeling in my skin. * Feels nice in my skin and smells good too! * Purchased in the Tickle Me Pink which is a nice pale pink. The smell is not good. When applied the blush is very sticky snd does not blend out well. I won't be purchasing this blush again. * I love the color however it does not show on my skin no matter how many layers I put on. Plus, it smells and feels like I'm putting lipgloss on my cheeks, which I do not like as I have sensitive skin."
101,jane iredale,purepressed blush,pimprod2032200,2596240," * I really liek this leoduct it gives my face a natural sheen to it. My only objection would be how expensive it is and the color i bought was slightly different than online. (I bought velvet petal) * Ordered the lightest color cotton candy in hopes it would be a very soft and light pink blush color, but the color  in reality was way darker and more bold and nothing of a baby pink color. Still it is a pretty blush color and I will use it, but I was rather disappointed in the difference of color. This was not what I wanted to have and therefore I will withdrew 2 stars. * I have used Jane Iredale products for years.  I wish Ulta carried more of their products. * Jane Iredale powder products are the best! I have oily, textured skin with baby hairs, and this blend flawslessly and lasts all day! I've only tested the matte blushes, I owe several colors and would buy more if Ulta carried more shades! * I love the color and texture. It goes on smooth and lasts all day without irritation. * So beautiful and sheer. Just the right amount deposited and I don't have to blend much. Gorgeous colors. I got two and I think I'm going to buy a third one. * Love this blush. Most blushes are too bright on my fair skin and even with a light touch, I feel like I have to blend it forever. Jane Iredale blushes are so beautiful. I got two."
102,tarte,clay play to-go cheek palette,pimprod2033147,2596620," * If you want a teenage shimmery vacation look, than this is probably great. Not an everyday look for sure. Just overall too much shimmer in everything, especially the blush, it looked like highlighter on. Packaging was nice ans compact but that's about it. * Love love this pallet, if your looking for a to go face pallet this is what you would want in your makeup bag hands down. Product is very pigmented and the whole pallet lasted me a whole year!! This is my second purchase! Id like to point out i never miss a day without makeup so i personally think you are getting your moneys worth and the highlighter will have you poppin and you will be that girl. Dont say i didnt put yall on 🤭 * Im obsessed with this palette. I have light to medium fair skin and it's beautiful I feel like its shimmer not glittery. Just bought a second one incase they run out * I'm obsessed with this palette so much I'm sad it's stars arebt higher. lol It gives you that perfect I spent all day at the beach look. * I have been on a quest to replace my 4 year old cheek palette from Tarte, and this ain't it. The colors don't apply evenly and there is way too much glitter in the blush and highlighter. I returned it and will continue to scrape the pans of my old palette until i find a suitable replacement. * The blush is show stopping. I get stopped all the time when i wear it. So confused why the reviews are bad bc this palette is gorgeous. the highlighter is pretty, and the bronzer is quite pigmented. Nothing too special- the blush is def a game changer tho. * I really wanted a cheek palette to cut down on clutter in my makeup bag. I was sorely disappointed to learn this wasn't it. The highlighter is just glitter. Way too coarse of a glitter than I prefer for a highlight. It looks nice as a shadow. The blush is more of a highlight, it's very iridescent. I learned that I prefer matte blush after using this. The bronzer warmed up my light complexion nicely but it does not make a good contour color; I use it more for a sun kissed glow. There is a lot of fall out from this palette.  It is usable but not as I intended it."
103,kylie cosmetics,powder blush stick,pimprod2045159,2623920," * After about two days of using this blush, it gave me a terrible rash on both of my cheeks. I don't consider myself to have sensitive skin and I've never had this happen! This product is cheaply made, and I do not recommend. For some reason, it's not allowing me to upload a photo. * Love the color, consistency,  ease of application.  Blends smoothly * I bought Breakfast in Bed and Kylie, you have surprised me. I use a blush brush to blend the blush into the apple of my cheeks and it applies beautifully. My favorite thing about this blush is the satin like finish. Im not a big fan on blushes that make you look oily, but this one sits right in between matte and satin. * I was skeptical about this color because it has a coral orange tint, but it looks beautiful and sun kissed on the skin. I tried her other colors, but this one is the most natural and olive skin tone. * loved it until i realized it has shimmer and no where did it say it had shimmer. other than that its a good product * I bought this directly from the kyliecosmetics site. This was hard to blend and made my cheeks look patchy. * I have the shade meet me there, it is the perfect mauve and the formula is so buildable, has easily become my favorite!!!"
104,milani,"all-inclusive eye, cheek & face palette",pimprod2030331,2590468," * you must have this palette in your bag, is amazing you can do soft makeup and as well a glam makeup just using this palette. Is cheap, and has a lot of pigmentation * Colors look pretty in the pan, but look completely different when applied. Too orange, especially the eyeshadow. * I love a good all-in-one face palette for my makeup on the go bag. This drugstore version had what I need. However, the bronzer is a little too yellow for my fair skintone, the shadows are pinky (personally, I would love a more neutral trio that I van use for day-to-night), and I would trade the shimmery blush for a contour shade or a matte highlighter shade. My opinions are based on the fact that I use this for an everyday palette on-the-go and not for a certain look. * I use this daily and does not break me out!! * I really like this product. I like using a cream blush underneath and then one of these on top to set it. You can't beat the price and the quality is very good. * I wish they would make more all-in-one palettes like this. It is good quality, and flattering shades. Please make more! * The bronzer made me look orange and the eyeshadow falls off of my face, same with the sparkles from the sparkly blush but the highlighter is amazing and the blush is very pigmented."

I still love the blushes though * The fall out is insane. The color is a challenge to work with. * Smells great. Beautiful color. Packaging luxurious. But very light pigmented. * It leaves me with a sun kiss look! * Has talc :( wanted to love it but it is not a clean product. They should not be advertising as clean. * I love this blush and bronzer in one. I use it often. Im light medium skin tone. I think its very flattering. A little goes a long way. The formula to me is great, very pigmented, smooth, glowy but not too glowy yet very natural. I love it and its lasted me for a long time now. * Altjough the pan is a big size for the money every color is very orange. Would make nice eyeshadow but ot blush buy to orange as a bronzer"

Very beautiful colors. I ordered the deep one and the blush and sparkly pink highlighter are out of this WORLD as well as the bronzer and contour shades. I see myself using this palette very frequently * This palette is amazing it has definitely been my go to, for everyday, my favorite out of the palette are the bronzers and blushes, I do wish that Ulta would start carry the deeper shades in store because the picture online sometime can be misleading. * I am NOT deep toned, and I use all of them!!  I love, love, love it!! * 1* for Ulta
5* for Morphe

I'm tired of always having my shade range available online only. Beautiful palette, bold colors, and deep enough for the darkest skin tones. 

I just hate the fact that I have to wait days in order to get my shade most of the time. In addition to me having to purchase multiple shades in order to find my exact one. 

This is so frustrating and I hope Ulta stops this practice. * I love the colors and tones it gives my face. It takes the guess work out"
107,benefit cosmetics,value size liquid lip blush & cheek tint,pimprod2043819,2620380," * Four stars for the color alone; FINALLY a lip stain that works on light olives and isn't just an oversaturated red/hot pink. Brands: take notes! This doesn't last as long on the lips as I had hoped, but it is decent. The worst part about this product for me is the rose scent. I absolutely cannot stand rose and I especially don't want it on my lips. Thankfully, the scent does disappear fairly quickly and doesn't linger. * I will not be recommending this product to anyone.  It dried out my lips so badly and the color isn't consistent on my lips and looks splotchy. * It's a little pricey for the size of the product but it's definitely worth it. I really like the color selection and it's convenient for travel. * I would not recommend this to anyone!!  It doesnt stain the lips like it should and it's definitely not worth the price!!  I would not buy this again!! * I love the color the it gives you in lips and cheeks * I don't wear lipstick or gloss; I prefer a natural stain that gives a hint of color but also stands up to my lip balm addiction. I had found the perfect stain at The Body Shop but had to find a replacement once I ran out of my stash. Enter this Benefit lip stain. I love the desert rose color, but this doesn't work anything like my Body Shop stain.  One application gives great natural color that dries quickly, but it also vanishes quickly. There isn't even a hint of tint left after less than an hour of normal wear. Needs some work on the staining part of the formula. * I grabbed the Play Tint color during 50% off sale days because I've  been in search for a good lip stain…but this didn't do it for me. This tint was not a good color of my lips…it's very peach-ish and felt a bit heavy. I did try it with another color over it (to make it work) but still didn't care for it. Returned."
108,charlotte tilbury,lip & cheek glow,pimprod2043349,2619522," * I like this product. It applies nicely and leaves a bit of a glow. It also feels nice on the lips unlike many other multi use products. Wear time is similar to most cream blushes.  However, I don't think the Colour or Dreams is the most flattering shade for lighter skin tones. It's a deep brownish rose and probably best suited to medium to tan skin tones. It's a nice texture and feels hydrating but there needs to be more soft shades. I have less expensive cream blushes that offer just as much with a better shade range. Pretty packaging though! Since we are going into Winter I will keep it but I prefer a more brightening shade. Maybe something a little more pink. * Cream blush easily blends over foundation powder or liquid. The deeper rose shade is good for summer into fall. * I bought the red blush because it's trending, and it is so perfect. I brush it across my cheeks and over my nose for a sunburned effect, it's gorgeous. I had never used cream blush before. It's actually not that messy or inconvenient, and it doesn't feel greasy. Easy to get used to. * I was disappointed that that the color was more brown than pink. Also that it was very light in pigment. I needed to apply several layers before I saw any blush on my cheeks. 
My friend also bought this product but in a different shade. She had the opposite effect. Her tint, which was a bright pink, deposited too much color. * Product works well on my skin. Product does what it advertises to do * I have just recently started using cream blushes. The one in my current rotation is Rare Beauty's Vulnerable Melting Blush. I like it, however, it began pulling my foundation underneath. I also wanted a bit more pigment. I decided to go with Charlotte Tilbury's Lip and Cheek Glow. Oh my goodness it is so pretty. Every time I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I see how glowy this blush is. It looks even better with a highlighter. I am pretty fair, so I chose the shade Pillow Talk Colour of Dreams. This is exactly the shade I was looking for. The right amount of pigment to where I don't look bare or look like a clown. This is now my go-to blush for a no makeup-makeup look or full glam. * I've tried many cream/liquid blushes and this made it to holy grail. Usually terracotta works best for me but this is unique.  I think soft brick may be close.  It's more neutral than it looks. 
Blends easily with brush or sponge. Apply and look like a goddess."

111,iconic london,"multi-use blush, bronze, and highlight cream palette",pimprod2043657,2620845," * The palette itself is really pretty, but when applied they are hard to blend and the blushes are too sparkly for my liking. The dark contour color is way too dark, I will probably never use that one, might be okay on eyes. The other contour colors are nice but I wish they were easier to blend, I tried with brushes, you really have to buff them out . The blushes are way sparkly in the sunlight. They apply ok with brush or fingertips and leave a sheen with sparkle. I do like the color of the blushes, I just wish they didn't have glitter. The highlighter is probably the best one in the palette, it leaves a nice shine as would be expected from a highlighter. I'm kind of half tempted to return this one, just not crazy about it, it is winter right now though, perhaps better in warmer months. I think the lip and blush palette might be better for me. * I love this palette. Its packaged very nicely, colors are flattering and it blends well with fingers or a brush. Will definitely rebuy!! * Loved the product but the color palette ended up not working for me. * I was worried the cream consistency wouldnt last long on my combo skin… though I hydrate it well. But it is really great!! This palette last long especially if you prep and set it right! The colors are skin like. So its somehow natural looking while being so glowy and glamorous!! The glitter looks pretty big in the cream. But once on the skin it's gorgeous. Perfect ratio of glowy and shimmery! Nooot greasy of oily! * I loved my Nars O-gasm 🎨 to death; I wish it were permanent. This Iconic London Cream palette 🎨 is the next best thing - the closest cream 🎨 I've found at Ulta - to the Nars. I waited until I had a ton of points and a 20% off prestige coupon to purchase. I paid about $20 out of pocket for it. Now that I've used it a bunch I would/will pay full price if necessary. I'm 46, light complexion w/combo skin. These creams are very nice, pigmented and blend beautifully. I 'set' using the Nars Crystal Powder, then top areas w/desired powder products. I 'spot set'- chin, lower forehead, top half of cheeks and lightly on the nose. (Dior Forever Skin Glow foundation 1W).. Its great to take on the go/traveling. Nice packing - good bang for your buck 👍🏼. * Although the Iconic London Brush, Bronze & HL palette is kinda close- its still nowhere near my Nars Or*gasm cream face palette (limited edition). However, I love this palette for it's own reasons, which I listed above. * I would get this if you are scared of very pigmented blushes the contours are nice and creamy but not the blushes and the blushes have glitter. The highlight is nice and creamy as well."
112,morphe 2,quad goals multi-palette,pimprod2026433,2585074," * This palette is amazing!!! I got it in the shade pink please, and it's soo pretty. The eyeshadow is a beautiful shimmer. You can easily control how much blush gets put on. The lip balm is hydrating. The highlight is a perfect shine. It is a little smaller than I was expecting, but this makes it perfect for traveling. Before I initially purchased, some reviews said the eyeshadow breaks easily, but I've had it for a while now and there's no damage. * Color Analysis = Light Summer. Recommended by consultant. Bought for those day's I'm in a hurry & for this summer's travels. Each color is perfect for me. * I loved the compact, colors, and the size! But they eyeshadow fell out very easily. * I was really excited to try this product, as it would be an all-in-one travel friendly cosmetic solution. However, as soon as I removed it from the box, the plastic was broken at the hinges. I'm so disappointed at the cheap quality. Will be returning. * This set is just alright. The eyeshadow isn't really a usuable on its own. Pigmentation is pretty poor all across the board. * I have been loving the oh so nudie stack to do my makeup on the go. The top is a buildable shimmery eyeshadow, the second layer works as a bronzer/blush combo on my fair skin, the lip balm adds a faint swipe of color, and the highlighter is nice. * So I got the Oh so Nudie stack on sale one day and gave it a shot even though I'm not a morphe fan. This killed it. The eyeshadow is especially good and super flashy and looks really pigmented when applied correctly. The blush is flattering for my tanner skin tone it's like the perfect blush and bronzer mix. But my fav is the face highlight balm, it's the best highlight ever. It's so flattering and real looking. No powder glitter or pigments that look good in one angle and terrible in the other. This is just a clear balm that doesn't rub in and disappear like others I have tried like this. It looks really good on their hint hint skin tint which I'm loving as well and use every day since it is the perfect oil free which is a must yet glowy foundation tint. Morphe2 is definitely doing it for me which is nice to find out because now that I see these other stacks I kind of need them..."

However I got the berry shade and it was too much for my light skin, so I returned it. I wish it was more buildable so that i could wear it without it being overpowering. If you have a darker complexion you will love the dark shade. I can't rate it bad, it was my fault about getting a shade that dark. * it lastes so long and the pigment is AMAZING! * Omg the coverage of this is amazing,its also super buildable,i say star with a very tiny amount and build it up because its crazy pigmented but you can definitely blend it out,not that its creamy its just a really hood blush, i can either do a natural look or a more coquette flirty look if i want to look extra pink,but you definitely have ti be careful ti not get blush blindness🩷 * This blush is very pigmented, so a little goes a long way. However, it is very smooth and blendable, and as long as you use a light hand it is looks beautiful. * Very pigmented, but you can control how much is applied.

So happy!!!! * I bought the nude tude shade and unfortantely for me i do not love it. The product is fast drying and when first applied looks very pigmented. But no matter what products I use with it or set with it this stuff DISAPPEARS. I really wanted this to be my ""blonzer"" shade but its just not worth the $$$ to me. * I like this blush you need very little and it blends easily * I've repurchased the shade Nude 'Tude twice now since this launched. Its not that you need a lot of product, its just that I use it pretty frequently. Its a neutral shade that just looks so natural on my skin, goes with any and all makeup looks. I bought two other shades as well, and they are nice but very bright and don't get used as much. 

The formula of this is a whipped mousse-like texture that is matte and blurring. It dries semi-quickly, so apply one cheek at a time, but don't stress about it setting too fast. I don't find it difficult to work with, nor is it patchy."

Easy to blend, beautiful color that does not fade. * This product is great! I am very fair skin with cool understones and own Carmel and Cherry. I also own Bubble in the powder. These are beautiful colors and are so easy to apply. They blend like a dream, are buildable and last a long time on the skin. I preferred this over RMS Beloved. Love these, very happy, will continue to purchase. * The package od the blush stick came with smeared product of the blush stick outside. It was scatched on the upper blush stick and the package was not in it's original condition. Since it was on sale i didn't return it, but who's doing the shipping controls? I like the blush, but that makes me upset that the package is done so carelessly. * Was a great purchase. * These blushes are amazing. I use these with or without a base and it blends out beautifully. I haven't had any issues with pilling or patchiness. I have several colors and am always looking out for the limited edition colors. These may have a learning curve depending on the other makeup being used, but I'd recommend trying to apply with a brush rather than direct contact and remember to pat not swipe! * For reference, I bought the cream blush along with the cream bronzer and comparing the two formulas, the blush is more like oily and slick like. I dont know if its because my blush came a little melted or thats just the formula. It could also be quality control because I see that in reviews from this brand in other products. Overall, I like the product. I didn't experience any patchiness or color fading. It's better to tap this product in than smear it. I have combination/oily acne prone, textured, skin and it lasted on my skin without any problems. * I am an advid makeup collector and have MANY cream blushes in my collection. These are definitely some of my absolute favorites! I own teddy, bubble gum and Jam and they are all beautiful but jam and teddy are something else! Out of all the blushes i own im always reaching for those 2 specifically. I have fair to light skin and teddy is the absolute best neutral everyday blush that goes with every make up look. Jam is also fabulous. It looks like a natural berry flush on the cheeks. Super blendable and creamy and i love how most of them have a matching powder blush to set with"

I didn't have to extend much to use it the first time so I'm not sure why it fell out. Difficult to use now. * I have combo oily skin. The shade nude buff did not work for my light to medium neutral undertone. It barely showed and disappeared. I own other shades and just realized that swiping it directly is not the best and it can drag the skin.  It can also be the formula since this is the matte version. * Love the color and it blends out so easily! * I purchased in nude buff. The first thing i noticed was its off putting smell. If looking for a subtle blush this was not it. Did not blend well. I will say building the blush for a more dramatic looked allowed for better blending. Unsure this was the right color for my medium skin with olive/ yellow undertones. Did look nice on lips. * Nice compact stick, simple application and blend. Genius. * Goes on smooth and creamy.

But I'm in my 40s.  Why would this color even exist and at this price?  I warned the clerk returning it not to unleash the glitter. * I love the feel, color and staying power * I'm a registered nurse who has worked in dermatology for years, for that reason Jane Iredale has always been my ""holy grail"" because of the high quality product and packing. This another disappointment in recent years with changing once elegant classy formulas and packaging to cheap glitter makeup with flimsy packaging. I was hopeful the color mist would be a replacement for my beloved in touch cream blush in clarity but no way!!! This reminds me of something I would see in my 3 year old daughters play makeup kit. The glitter in this is beyond overwhelming and actually makes skin look drier. Please bring back in touch cream blush . I think it might be time to move on and find a new makeup brand for my needs. * Disappointed, too much gliter and doesn't blend well. * I got Glorious and am relatively fair, and I love it. It doesn't last super long, but it's easy to re-apply. I like to put it on even when I don't have other makeup on (like when I just woke up or go for a walk or whatever) for just a natural slightly flushed look.

But if you want more vibrant and just smoth blushes then maybe save uour money and buy a better pallatte but if your trying yo save a coin and just want multiple blushes that arent bad then go ahead * Pros:
Great variety of blush shades, all in wearable colors.
Great for fair to medium skin tones (neutral/olive/warm undertones mostly)

Cons:
The wear time is average.
This palette def wont work for deep/deepest skin tones.
May not be flattering on cool tone skin. * Affordable and beautiful * love love love the dofferent shades of colors, plus very essy to apply * Really love this blush set! I am a fair skin woman so I am not sure if it would be as pigmented for my darker complexion pals but if you are fair skin it works well. Blushes are blendable and enjoy that I am able to switch my blush around each day. * If your lookihg for a budget friendly blush palette this one is the one you should get!

It goes on smooth, blends nicely, matte, versitile, and stays on ALL day! The only issue i had was that I bought ot online so I couldnt test the colors. I purchased the color Kind Kelly because it looked more nude-y which is what I was going for, but its actually pretty hot pink looking (at least on my skin) and im light/medium toned. That isnt the company's fault or anything to do with the product so thats why im still giving it 5 stars. 
Nothing more annoying than people giving low rarings because of shipping issues or the fact that they chose the wrong color. You should rate according to the product and how it performs. 
So yes, i highly recommend! Ill be taking my lazy butt into the store to test the other colors because this product works, and works great! * The color I have (My Mimi) is no longer available, but the ease of use with this product warrants a review. It's super quick to apply. It's blurring on the face. With a small layer of powder blush over the top of it along with a setting spray, this blush lasts all day. I'm talking 12+ hours. * I have 3 shades! Beautiful colors and I love how they apply, the finish and they blend very easily. Would absolutely love bronzers in this same formula and packaging! * I love this blush because it is a buildable product and easy is to blend out, I got kind Kelly and I think it is a beautiful shade, I would definitely recommend this, because this is now my favorite blush! * I got the kind kelly one and it blends well and it is really pigmented. Love it!! * I love the color & formula, you can blend out with a finger or a sponge so it isn't as pigmented, and the color lasts so long!

Love the Ravishing Rose color.  bought a new pack recently and the color is a burnt yellow orange color.  Nothing like the peach pink shimmer color it once was.  Did Revlon  change it or is it  a glitch color by mistake ??? * 020 Ravishing Rose used to be my go to for years! Did the shade change? I have ordered 3 and they're not the same shade as in the photo * The Oh Baby pink shade is my holy grail blush, it is so classy and beaufiful without being overpowering and stays all day. It plays really well with all my other products as well. I tried Ravishing Rose and felt that the shade advertised is waaaay different than the shade I got. It was super peachy with a lot of glitter and it didn't work for me. But Oh Baby pink is accurate and it will be a staple for me for the long run! * I absolutely LOVE this blush! As someone with pretty oily skin, especially on my cheeks, this is one of the only blushes that I find wears well on me and stays put throughout the day. It never goes on patchy, and is pigmented but not too pigmented. Also, being a very fair person with slightly cooler undertones, the shades are very flattering. * Love the Blush perfect color"

The cream-to-powder formula is easy to apply with my ring finger and it has a nice silky feel to it. Smash suits my light, cool-neutral skin well and it lasts throughout the day.
It's worth noting that I had it in my car for several hours on a hot day and it did not melt. * Very pigmented, blends out beautifully and buildable. I'm very new to using liquid/tints/balm blushes and this was the first one i ever used. It was very easy to blend no matter how long i let it sit, a little goes a long way and the finish is beautiful. Not heavy on the face and also works well with other products and does not seperate. * Very nice color, very buildable, not oily, not patchy, can go light or very heavy depending on how you wanna apply it. * I ran into this blush and let me tell you its chaos free! I struggled w blush application - too much, wrong place, you get it! I have found this balm version is pretty easy to apply, color is just enough allowing you to build. If you make a mistake, its easy to correct and so far doesn't ruin your foundation. This shade I chose was not the right one so I exchanged it for a lighter one. * love them both - thought Big O would be fun on my my cool olive skin ""news flash""  sexy as hel! Freaky is a soft subtle and feminine. Never judge a blush until you wear it.  💗 * Would I repurchase this again? No. Is the color beautiful? Absolutely.

This is so beautiful on the skin and doesn't take my foundation off underneath either. This is a huge win for the price. * I have very fair skin so I picked Blush Beam which is the lightest color available. It is much more red in person. Even the slightest bit is too much. For me it was a total waste of money. * this is definitely my new favorite blush it looks so natural it's also so easy to blend I can just is my fingers if I wanted to I would definitely recommend * I have light med Asian skin and use flamingo glow. Pat it on. It looks so amazing * These are gorgeous! I picked up 2 during the sale but will be getting the rest of them. These are a very thin, creamy, glowy sheer blushes that make highlighter unnecessary. No detectable glitter just the most beautiful sheen that brings your cheeks back to life! This formula does not dry down however, they do become less sticky but doesn't dry down completely.  Therefore, I would not consider these long wearing but that isn't in the claims either. As someone with dry skin, these are stunning and everything I want, and doesn't emphasize texture. I heard these are a dupe for the makeup by Mario plumping cheek blushes and I can totally see that being the case but I do not own those. * Such a creamy blush with good pigment.

But it doesn't last that long tbh. I wear it to school but at the end of the day some of it is gone. I would still recommend because the shimmer is really cute and I haven't found a blush that is cuter than this for everyday wear. It would be perfect if it lasted longer tho. I see everyone say the blush leaves them patchy, but that is most likely because they have facial hair. I shave my facial hair and it is no longer patchy after I shave it. * I do love the color. However, the longevity of this blush sucks. It doesn't last half a work day. I catch myself reapplying mutiple times a day to keep the color i want. * Really soft and truly works both on cheeks and lips. * Love this product. Goes on smooth. Looks and feels natural.

It looks so beautiful when applied with a brush, and it lasts all day. * I got this one in Coral and its perfect for winter * Very pigmented, easy to apply using a dense fluffy brush. A little goes a long way and I absolutely am here for the flawless pretty achieved. * I'm really annoyed with this one because the packaging seems like it would be a piece of cake to make refillable, but refills aren't sold for it? Strike one on sustainability for me. The lasting power wasn't great on me either."

I have aging, combo-oily skin and these stay ALL day. I use a smaller, less dense brush to stipple on my cheeks/temples/nose and it's perfection. I wish more people talked about this product because it deserves it! * This product is very lightweight and sheer which is perfect for summer months where you don't want a full face of makeup. Also the colors are nice (bought peach and cherry).

However, it instantly dries once it hits your face so you need to QUICK so that you aren't left with a streak of unblended color. Its hard to blend out and working to get it to blend moves any makeup that was underneath before application. It also looks patchy on the skin due to difficulty blending. * I've been eyeing this product for a while and decided to try Cherry as an affordable option to the red blush trend. This is STUNNING. Definitely best blended with your fingers right after application before it sets. Dewy and natural and effortless! * I bought this blush as a dupe for the you know what, and i ended up really enjoying this in my routine. The shade is very pretty and it feels so nice and cooling on your skin. Its just a little to blend. * This is a really pretty stain for lips and cheeks! I love the different shades. The price point is decent. I'd say this is a milk dupe but I think undone came out with this first! * OMG I love this blush! It's so buildable and it feels cool on your skin. It's a natural flush that you can keep subtle or really make it pop. * its like the tarte blush sticks but way better. they actually dry down and don't leave a greasy feel at all. ive had so many compliments its unreal. definitely more pigmented than a lot of other blush sticks/stains (looking at you benetint). excellent price for a great product"
140,iconic london,kissed by the sun multi-use cheek glow,pimprod2039117,2608756," * I love this blush. I have the shade ""play time"". It has beautiful pigment and is also buildable so you can get the vibrancy you want. My skintone is typically light medium neutral in most foundations for reference. I was hesitant because of the highlight aspect of this blush, but I find I love how it looks on the skin. A few notches ABOVE ""glow from within"" type vibe. I always use cream blush underneath. Like a rare beauty ""hope"" shade or maybe one of my patrick ta cream blushes. It really is a nice blush. If you are a blush girly give this one a try * It took me years of trial and error of finding the ideal blush for my too pale skin and I found the perfect blush without making me look like I am trying too hard. I believe the blush makes me feel like I have sunkissed skin instead the pale as a ghost skin I actually have! * I have been looking for a blush like this for a long time, one with a highlight and in this exact color. Hot stuff is probably the best color ever, with the soft pink tone and the peachy goldish highlight!

I've never tried iconic London before and this makes me want to try more of their stuff, this blushlighter is so good! it goes on so soft and silky smooth, plus it also stays on well! I like that the color can be built up too, for more of a pop. I think all the colors are very neutral and flattering, and I want them all! * I've been looking for something exactly like this for a long time. a blush with a highlight and I've finally found it! it's so soft and silky and applies like a dream! it also has good staying power. I purchased the color hot stuff and let me tell you! it's the perfect color for us medium warm olive/gold toned people out here! as a reference I use UD 50WY in stay naked liquid foundation. this is now my favorite blush! now what am I supposed to do with all my MAC blushes I won't be using, lol! 
I have used this as a regular blush, which gives a soft glow all over the cheeks and as as highlighter over different blush. if using as a highlighter, it does have a pink under tone, so I had to blend it a little with the blush I did use and it looked so good still! this was my first iconic London item I've ever tried, and I'm now obsessed and am going to have to try more products from them! * Love how it looks on my skin. * Easy to blend and a good shade that works well on medium skintones without feeling heavy or overly saturated * Love the tanny glow on my fair skin. I can wear it date/night depending on the occasion. Soft and seamless intensity formula that leaves a gentle shimmery on my cheeks."

It just feels like hydrating moisturizer then blends like second skin . Beautiful natural flush . I have 3 of these and want more now ! * I bought this blush myself. I find it easy to use and blend. Lasted a long time on my skin. There is so much blush in the tube that I am not sure if I will ever finish it. I am a fan. * I purchased the Southbound color.  Although this appeared to be one of the brighter shades, it really didn't give much color to my skin.  I have medium-light neutral tone skin.  I prefer to go more natural with a light makeup with skin care ingredients and a natural creamy blush with a pop of color.  Although the consistency of the blush is nice and it goes on smoothly, I really didn't see any color . * This truly is the nicest liquid blush I have ever used. Provence is a great color and blends very naturally with my lighter skin tones. * I bought this with the laura mercier tinted moisturizer because i assumed it would mix well and last with the same brand. I was wrong. Now, it could have also been my skin care routine that caused it to seperate and be patchy on my skin. I tried it multiple times, multiple different ways and each time i had to remove it with makeup wipes and then just use my rare beauty blush. I wanted to love it, but unfortunately it was bad and a waste of money. Beautiful color though. * I bought this with the laura mercier tinted moisturizer because i assumed it would mix well and last with the same brand. I was wrong.

They have become part of my everyday makeup routine and I am totally in love with the colour payoff. * I actually got this as a gift for my mom as I've heard really good things about Nudestix blushes. She really loved it and says its easy to use and creamy * If you want to create a look in less than 5 mins this is the easiest kit you'll ever use! You have your blush, bronze and glow all in one kit making it super easy and fast to use. The shades are very creamy and are easy to blend with your fingers. * Everyone needs this kit! It is the perfect size for on-the-go and has a blush, bronze and glow color to use to create an easy and effortless look. * Hydrating pigmented good performance great size i specially love the bronzer * As i have gotten older my skin needs creams instead of powder. I sae these for such a good price and i got them. I love them they blend so nice and creamy. Its a perfect size too so they dont dry out and i can use them fully. * You can easily build up the products depending on what kind of look you're going for, and they blend so smoothly onto skin with fingertips or a sponge! I use this after prepping skin with DIME tinted sunscreen. The highlight blends best with fingertips as it is a little dark, so warm fingers disperse the glow a little better! This is a wonderful set for someone getting into more natural & simple glowwy makeup :)"

For reference, I'm a light olive leaning warm. * Color looks intimidating but it's not! One of my favorite go-to blushes for a feminine touch of color. * I know this bright pink looks intimidating, but if you apply it little by little, it's so gorgeous. I am very very fair, so not much product is needed, but I'm definitely going to keep ""Bubble"" on hand all the time. * Cute Barbie pink blush. You can go light or intense with these and I appreciate that. A little highlighter with these are perfection * I absolutely adore this blush. Saw reviews where they said it has no lasting power but mine will literally last a full 12 to 14 hours. The only downside I've noticed is that it can be a bit hard to blend. * Easy application. Smooth finish. Love this. The color Bubble on my cool fair skin is perfect. Usually even blushed labeled cool/neutral still afloat orange-y on me but this one is lovely. * I am a blush lover and I just found my favorite blush! This blush is simply beautiful, easy to blend, buildable, and long lasting. If you're thinking about it, buy it! You won't be disappointed."

Hard to apply. Color doesn't look the same on face. * Matches perfect with my skin and hair color * Stays on all day matches perfect with my skin and hair color * In Barbados.... Perfect shade to go with all the mochas trending out there * If you are looking for a super or even decently pigmented blush, this is not the one. If you are looking for a shiny blush and is barely noticeable then this is the one.

It's great for long-lasting color, however the color ""Flushed"" was just a bit overpowering on my light, cool, muted olive skin. It suits me better in the summer when I have a bit of a tan.

Natural looking color.0 * Such a fun makeup to use! the jelly delivers a punch! super pigmented. I love the flushed color for the summer sun burnt blush look. Excited to try some other colors. * I seen a review with somone as the same complexion as me, it looked nice on her. The pigment was actually there! But when i had tride it myself its like the gel was disappearing as i rubbed it in. Im disappointed at the fact it didn't work for me, even with layering. Plus the actual product is TINY! * This product gives a natural flush to the cheeks. It does dry down fast, so you have to work with the product quickly. My complaint is the size of the product.

I highly recommend this blush! * i use a brush to apply this product but even then it does not appear to be as noticeable compared to my other blush products (powder, liquid). very pretty design, though, so makes for a cute gift for someone. using a brush does not ruin the rose either.

when i finally do get some pigment, the color is beautiful. i got this blush in the color 'crown'. but it is just not worth the hassle to work it in. * I almost didn't buy this because there's no way this works, right? Like it's so pretty, it's just the aesthetic, form and not function, etc. NOPE. I got the color Crown and it is not nearly as red as it looks in photos, more of a rosy brown. It's the perfect all natural flush (I have light/medium skin with golden undertones). I've used it about a dozen times or more and the rose still maintains it's shape (I use an angled brush). It's also just so pretty that I reach for it over my other blushes now. * Had problems with other bushes and when I found this, I loved it. It's creamy and doesn't need a whole lot to pop. 🩷🩷🩷 * Winky Lux had a luxe line, LAQA, for a number of years and i LOVED their cream highlighters/blush in Preacher's Daughter (coral) and Rose Royce (light rose/pink.) When they ended the line i bought as many as i could. 

So now im out of the Rose Royce and haven't found a dupe. I was really hoping this would be it, but it's rock hard, difficult to apply and cheaply made. Yes, the rose is fun to look at, but it's not an effective product in any way. So disappointed. * I am really unhappy with this blush. It's patchy and doesn't last at all. It looks cute. * I've had 3 of these in different shades and it dissappears within 30 seconds of applying it like literally evaporates. so weird."

I apply it on the back of my hand, load my brush and apply it on my cheeks for the perfect pink health dose of color. It is such great quality too. So in love with this blush!! * It's my second time repurchasing this blush and I love it!!! Pigmented but easy to blend, plus it leaves a nice glowy finish. I consistenly used it everyday and it lasted a good while. * Very pigmented. A little goes a long way. I also dab a little bit on my lips for matching combo. * I love this formula!

Highly recommend. * I love this  so mich it gives a good tuch up to my makeuo * I liked this liquid blush for the price. I found that it wasn't very pigmented, a stripe from one cheek to the other gave me the color I wanted. Also left my face feeling a little sticky/oily. Good for the price though! * Love this product!

This is my first product ive tried from this brand and im so impressed. * I have the blackberry and coconut. blackberry shows up a bit more. both are very subtle and natural looking so it's hard to mess up. 

I apply directly to my cheeks and blend out with a brush, then add a little more and only buff the edges a bit. * This sheer gel is smooth and just the right amount of color. Use your fingers or a brush, it so easy to work with! Going to buy an extra one for my purse. * Beautiful color and easy application, smells like old heated plastic. Maybe its the batch i received which is why it was on sale but absolutely unwearable. * Beautiful shade (strawberry crush) and easy to travel with! * This is a great blush if you have dry skin and are going for a minimal makeup look. They are not super pigmented. You get a sheer wash of color and lots of glow. This is my every day blush, but not my special occasion / full glam blush. It does not dry down completely, but I wouldn't call it sticky. It gives a very dewy finish. * I have both coconut crush and blackberry crush. I bought the berry one first and love it so much I thought I'd try the coconut color.

I apply this blush using a brush and tap it in. You can make it as light/subtle as you want. It has a nice dewy finish which I love since I have dry skin. It doesn't remove foundation underneath.

As a lip color, the staying power isn't that good, but it's a nice color and shine. More like a balm.

To compare the colors I have, the berry is more pink/purple whereas the coconut is more red/orange. They are the same depth though. I have fair neutral skin so I can go between a deep winter and a deep autumn depending on the color scheme I  use."

It is literally one of the most amazing powdered blushes I've ever used. It has such a nice light powdery strawberry smell. Yes, the strawberries at the top wipe off, but the color underneath makes up for it. It also comes with a built-in brush and a mirror. I could not recommend a more perfect product. * I loveeeeeeeeeee the color!!!!!!!!! I do wish the strawberries stayed but what do you expect? * I use this every day in my makeup routine, and its never failed me before!! * One of my favorite blushes that I've used!

The cream highlight and powder highlight pair beautifully together. I love the color of the blush when swatched but I will say i was expecting more if a creamy texture, it feels more like a powder to me. Cant wait to try and would definitley recommend either way! * Love this palette so much. Probably one if my all time favorites as it works so well with my skin tone. Will buy again over and over! * The cream textures are really unique and superb formulas. The blush blends like a dream and the highlighter is unbelievable. It blends so easily with just a few taps from my finger. I cannot say enough about these two. Love. The powder highlighter is pretty and I do like it, but when you pair it with the two creams, it really isn't anything special. I wish it had been another cream. Another highlighter color or blush color in the cream formula would have been amazing. That's why I have 4 stars and not 5. Still fully worth the price tag for the two products though. * I'm not sure why the reviews are so great for this pallette. first of all, it arrived broken and second I'm pretty fair to medium skin and I have to put several coats of this on and it's hardly noticeable. In my opinion, definitely not worth the price. Highly disappointed. * I love this palette! The blush is agreat color and the cream highlighter is my favorite highlighter of all time. I use the powder highlighter as more of a highlight eyeshadow. I only wish the blush was a cream formula like the middle highlighter. * This texture is stunning. These formulas glide beautifully, no streakiness, perfect tones, and the texture is stunning. Believe the hype. Natasha's makeup is QUALITY. Worth every dime! * The interplay between color and texture in this palette is genius. I cant remember yhr kast time i felt so oretty, as i did when i wore this.

Does not look good at the end of the day. * I tried it in store and I loved the color, once I got home I tried it and hate it, it gets lost in the skin, as if I don't even have lipstick, maybe you have to use a few layers for the color to actually show on your lips. * In dark skin, in my 20s wirh genetically deep set undereyes. This stick helps give the illusion of a much smoother undereye. I cant see myself ever buying a different color correcter. Its so smooth. It makes a huge difference without being noticeable * Color perk may be a little too orange for my medium skin with olive/yellow undertones. But a little goes a long way and evens out dark circles with the help a dab of foundation on top! * Glides on nicely blended well, full in moisture. * Im 43 and have dark circles, puffiness, and fine lines under my eyes.

Sits beautifully on the skin. * I purchased this during the 21 days of Beauty Event. I would say it is absolutely worth the price point. I purchased the color terracotta as it was described as a burnt orange and I have been trying to practice not buying the same colors over and over. I have to say this shade is so beautiful and absolutely perfect for fall. It is sheer at first but you can build it up for the right amount of color. I cannot comment on how it fares as a lip tint yet but even if you only use it as a blush I think it is worth the buy. * The lip stain lasts minimal 3 hours and the tone is perfect! * I got the shade Blush. I love smashbox cosmetics and this product is no exception. Does what it says * I was looking for a smooth blush that didn't settle in my wrinkles. Smash box delivered! Although the sales girl tried to push pink/mauve (I'm not a pink color) & the terra-cotta (pretty but I am a redhead), I decided on the color Sunset (not Wisteria as mentioned) which was perfect with my fair skin."

Really like this and seem to be a good neutral pallet. This brand seems to have more products (on Ulta and their own website) suited for warmer skin tones. Would love to see more cooler and this seemed to be the most neutral/leaning cool I could find. Works well and lasts. * I love it and use it almost daily!!! * I love everything about this product, silky texture and beautiful colors. I am going to purchase other products from this brand. * This palette is stunning. Super easy to blend, it's pigmented and build able. It's my go to! * The colors are amazing and highly pigmented. I use it for everyday wear and it's my new favorite pallet! My only complaint is the shimmer eyeshadow isn't as pigmented as everything else, but that's not a huge problem. * I love this face palette. It is stunning & universally flattering on  most skintones & ages.  I love having mostly matte eyeshadows & the purple & green add neutral pops of color, compliment brown, green & hazel eyes & make lovely liners. I rarely wear bronzer & highlighter but the options provides are nice on my light to medium skin tone & not OTT. The blush is the perfect neutral pinky peach shade. * This eyeshadow palette is so stunning, so blendebel & great for travel"
168,kiko milano,unlimited blush,pimprod2032252,2595747," * This blush color is really beautiful. BUT it does not have enough pigment. Maybe a good blush starter for beginers but it was not my cup of tea. The reciews were all really good so maybe I got a defective blush… but elf, colour pop, and milani blushed are wayyyy better with pigment payoff and build ability. I will be returning this blush as soon as I get the chance to. :( * I LOVE KikosMilanos blushes, the package alone feels luxurious and fancy, the blushes apply with a velvet finish and it's just the flush of color I need without overpacking too much onto my cheeks. I usually swipe then pat it gently on my cheekbones. I repurchased a backup recently but I've been using this blush for a few years and it's lasted me that long. Still on the first one and don't want to run out when I do. 

Shade I purchased: 6

My Skintone: Light-Medium (Olive Tone) * Its cute but i thought it would be bigger 😭 * The first time I bought this was in Holland & I fell in love with it. Have not been above to find it for 2 years and I just happen to run across it on Ulta. Bought it now buying one for my sister. * This blush is so beautiful that I can't stop using it. The only thing I dislike is I heard Kiko Milano doesn't keep products around. * Pigment is gorgeous and package is just beautiful and the colors are so beautiful...but why all the shine? Give me some matte or satin finish then I'll repurchase. * I was excited to receive this blush because the color seemed beautiful ""golden coral"" but it doesn't have that much details on the product and when I received it it looked like a super shimmery highlighter. Not what I wanted, it would've been so beautiful without the glitter/shimmer"

Cannot even see it on the skin. * If you like the idea of liquid blushes but find them overly pigmented and/or difficult to blend, try this!  It's pigmented yet still sheer, and blends beautifully.  I put a little on the back of my hand, smear it around a little, then tap a synthetic brush into it and apply it to my cheeks.  It is buildable, so start with just a little bit and build to your desired intensity.  It applies beautifully and looks completely natural, too!  This is the first Covergirl product I've used in YEARS and I am impressed. * this was hard to blend out and didnt give much color pay off.  wont repurchase * I really loved these blushes. I put them on in the morning and I still have them on when I get home at night after a long day at work. The colors are very nice too, loved more than expected. Would totally recommend! * Bought this a few months ago expecting color...I was sorely mistaken. After I tried it I applied more because even though I extremely fair toned it did not show up at all and disappeared. I'm disappointed to say the least."

The blushes and bronzer are all matte formulas, and then the highlighter is the Super Shock putty-cream like formula. Personally, I never liked the Super Shock formula because I prefer using brushes when doing my makeup, and none of my brushes can pick up this formula, leaving me to do it with my fingers. Okay, whatever. I can get over that. But the biggest problem that I have with this highlighter is that it is mostly GLITTER. I love a glitter highlighter now and then, but not when using an everyday palette for an everyday look. It looks so weird to have matte bronzer and blush, and then a stripe of glitter on my cheekbones. It would be fine if the highlighter was a cute shimmery color, like Lunch Money, but it's very glittery which sucks. Tbh, I bought a cheap Essence highlighter so that I could crush up the ColourPop one and transfer the Essence one into the compact so that I can actually have an all in one palette. Oh well.

However, the packaging is a bit of a miss too. Aesthetically, it looks great, but mine no longer clasps shut even though I haven't done anything like drop it. So it's probably not a great option for traveling anymore, which was why I wanted it… lol * I love this blush. It has the perfect combination of bronzer, blush shades, and highlighter. I like to mix all of the shades onto my cheeks. I continue to purchase it because I love how it looks on my cheeks and the compliments I recieve. I just have one reoccurring issue with this product and it has nothing to do with the shades and everything to do with the packaging. Everytime I have purchased this product the container falls apart so easily. It fails to protect the powder causing it to eventually crumble apart. I continue to purchase it because I absolutley love it but I wish colourpop would read all their reviews regarding the poor container packaging and create something more durable so that the powder will not shatter. * One of my go to palletes, especially for the blush!!

Its so easy to apply and the color looks much better on than it does in the compact. * unfortunately this blush didn't work for me, the glow that this gives is a bit glittery and emphasizes all my texture. The color is pretty but looks cakey on my skin. Not flattering on my skin at all and this will be going back. I recommend fresco from her original blushes. * All That Sparkles is THE BEST, glowiest, gorgeous blush for fair skin. It looks like it would be way too light and not have any pigment, but is so dang pretty and radiant with just the right amount of pink flush. * When I first opened this blush I thought it would be to light but I am happy to say I was wrong. it is a soft flattering shade with a slight glowing shimmer.

I'm OILY and it stayed on the entire night. I fell asleep with it on and it DID NOT BUDGE. STAYED COMPLETELY THE SAME. If you're an oily  girl you NEED this palette. This formula is top notch. Cannot wait for them to make more colors. And yes, if you're dry or normal to dry, it is going to be harsh on your skin and if you don't moisturize your face well you cannot blend it. However, I absolutely had NO trouble blending. It is not a secret technique that I'm using on my face. HYDRATE and use an oil with your face cream if you need to. * Beautiful shades of peach and highlighter. Goes on smooth and never blotchy. Hope they add different colors in the future…this is a keeper for sure!! * The shades included are pretty but the pigment and blendability is lackluster. It might be worth it to buy it on sale. I am going to return this item and use my Mac blushes instead. * The powders aren't bad, but the Highlighter breaks so easily that I haven't received one not broken yet, so I can't recommend this since it's just constantly broken."

Unfortunately had to return.  Good cruelty-free product & would recommend & buy if a more pinker, cooler color. * The blush stays on for along time * Perfect amount shine to make it look every day and or glam.  Perfect for ever my occasion.  The level of pigment is perfect! * Beautiful, sheer wash of a rose colored hue to perfect your no makeup, makeup look. I only reach for this now since buying. * I read the reviews for this before purchasing because it is a bit pricey and everything seemed promising, but the highlighter and blush are both glittery. I was under the impression that the highlighter and blush wouldn't have specks of glitter in them because the reviews said it wasn't sparkly but it most definitely is. It does give a nice glow but the sparkles are visible to the eye. They're both nice and will be used, I just feel mislead because I thought it would give a nice sheen without glitter and I was wrong."

I feel like this product also lasts a long time, I am so pleased! * I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. I found this powder blush to be just okay. The color payoff was great, but it was a bit too dark for my personal taste. I think it would be better for those with slightly darker skintones or for those who may be on stage performing and want their makeup to be a bit bolder. * Nice color and pretty much I like the texture I would say is a god texture to use on summer most of the times 
The color pink is super nice I really like to have that color in y collection 
I think is a nice product for a nice price. I would recommend this blush * I really liked this blush. I received this product free in exchange for my review. The Berry Beautiful color works really well for light/medium skin tones. I loved the quality. It's very pigmented. You don't have to waste product because a little goes a long way and it applies easily with a brush. I think it's worth the investment. It also lasts throughout the day even without a setting spray. * I truly love trying out Pur skin perfecting powder blushing act matte blush. It one of the best blushes I have ever used . It so smooth on my skin . Makes my skin look so beautiful. And color is so gorgeous not to strong but buildable color . Love it . * This looked quite intimidating in the pan but it gives a nice flush of berry on the cheeks. If you're pale like me I'd use a lighter hand, but I think this shade will work on lots of skin tones. The scent reminds me a bit of Tarte powder products. I like the sleek minimal packaging as well. As far as formula goes it's nice and smooth, the area where I apply this blush always has a youthful look so maybe the extra skincare ingredients actually do something lol."
182,flower beauty,ultralight liquid blush,pimprod2043495,2617300," * I wanted to try this product as this color was highly recommended but it was so disappointing. I should've looked into the reviews more because as soon as I started to squeeze out the product a yellow oil began to come out. Regardless of how much pigment came out of the product, the yellow oil always remained. I am too scared to even try this on my skin. * Honestly a little disappointed in this formula as i love the OG cloud paints. I wanted the cloud paints in a more punchy color with a wand applicator. This are not them. The liquid is very thin amd while it blended well, mine dried down (as much as it will) patchy. * I won this blush in a free giveaway and I've never tried flower beauty before, but I was blown away. I have mine in the shade poppy and it makes for the most beautiful sunburnt shade. It's pigmented, but still buildable and easy to work with. I love how dewy it looks on the skin as well. This is definitely a new fav. * I love the blush and it's consistency. I was a little scare about the liquid formula seperating my makeup but that didn't happen. It's nice for me since I love less pigmented products * I think the poor reviews on this product were expecting a dupe (even though its not marketed as one). It says ultralight snd thats whst it is, irs perfect for summer (not full glam, not on foundation). Toasty is the perfect blush/bronzer combo. * I really like this blush! you barely need to put product on your face to have a lot of pigment, so I know this thing is gonna last forever. you do need to blend kinda quickly, and I recommend using a liquid blush brush. I only wear tinted moisturizer, not foundation, so idk how it would work with that, but it does just fine with moisturizer. This is an affordable, lovely blush! * I got the shade cheeky and it has a bit more warmth than i expected for a 'blue pink', but it's a super pretty color anyways! it has the perfect medium amount of pigment and was super easy to blend out with a pretty finish. Wore well too"

The purple on the right looked absolutely gorgeous to me and was the reason I bought the palette, but its somehow orange on my skin. The first pink is nice though, but my search for a cool-toned berry blush continues. 

Also I think the color goes on a bit blotchy compared to other similarly priced powder blushes. * Great smooth blush and great colors. Value well worth the price * Multi use I like to use the orange for extra bronzing. I love the pink shade and all of the iridescent sparkle. * I purchased this for my 13 year old niece. She is medium toned skin with long straight dark hair. This looked lovely on her. She really liked it! * I found the pigments patchy and hard to blend. Also not really sure what skin tone this palette is for... I'm very fair and the lightest color is still way too light. I actually can use it as a highlighter. The medium two do work for me as blush but honestly on the skin they look the same. And then I though the darkest one would be pretty if I could sheer it out, but since it's so patchy I end up having to use a lot and then it's just way to dark. I think it would be better if they made different palettes for different skin tones. O, and if you're buying this for the glitter, don't. It's only on top. * This palette is stunning! Beautiful, BEAUTIFUL, shimmering colors, and very affordable! * I love glue and sparkling things. I'm crazy about this set because it has the colors I like with the touch of glitter that I love. I bought it as a gift but had to keep it for myself 🥰"
184,laura mercier,roseglow highlighting powder,pimprod2026325,2584989," * I like anything of Laura Mercier's. Quality products. You will not be disappointed. * A photo doesn't always portray a color accurately or how it will actually look like on your face. Looking at the photo the pallet appears soft pink. It is actually more brown on the skin and like a bronzer. Perhaps trying to make it lighter will help. * This leaves the most unflattering tone on my skin. Not universal and leaves a grey-ash cast. I don't like this AT ALL. Also leaves texture. * Love this LM highlighter I use for an everyday simple look I use my cc cream and LM Chai blush and some mascara to complement my look 🥰 * I was certain I'd love this and ordered it sight unseen. Well, ...

Pros: It has a lovely sheen, noticeable but not metallic or Ofra-y, with zero glitter.

Cons: It's not at all the pale pink you see in the picture, and I'm really not sure what the brand means by ""self-adjusting to match all skin tones."" The color is truer to the product's name; it's a definite, discernible rose. My skin is light to light-medium, not fair by any means, and there's no way this could be a highlighter on me. (Thing is, I don't think it's rich enough to work on deep skin. And it seems too cool to be right for tan skin.) Anyway, on me it's a blush/blush topper for sure.

I can't complain about the formula, and I'm sure I'll use it - but if I'd been able to swatch it first I probably wouldn't have bought it. * I had high hopes for this highlighter but was disappointed when, what I expected to be a pale neutral pink shade was actually a midtoned champagne that's too dark and warm for my very fair, cool toned skin.  

Since this isn't available at any store near me, I bought it based on the photo showing a pale pink swatch, the description of a neutral undertone and the self adjusting shade claim, none of which is accurate.  I could tell just by swatching that it wouldn't work but I applied it anyway and saw that it definitely was too dark and warm.  Since I only wore it for a few minutes, I can't speak to the formula or wear time other than to say it's pigmented with a glitter free buildable shine.  

With the level of technology available, there's no excuse for product photos to be so inaccurate, a problem that also adds to the already excessive amount of wasted makeup.  I love many Laura Mercier products but this was a fail and while I think the shade could work on light to tan skintones, it's too dark for fair and possibly too ashy on deep."

It's a large, decent pan size of blush. I love that this pink color looks very natural on my cheeks. I applied it using the Baby Paw Brush. It gave me a subtle, healthy looking blush. I will say that if you want a super noticeable blush, you'll have to apply several times. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I received this product from half magic and influencers and exchange for my honest opinion. The pigmentation of this blush product is beautifully defined. It blends very well on the cheek bone and the nose there is no scent which is great because I'm a sensitive skin girly and I break out easily. The packaging is this cute eco-friendly neon, green and 
It's environmentally Friendly. The texture is a soft blush, not powdery or anything like that, just a soft blush that you can easily push down on the brush, and tap onto your chin. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I received this product from half magic and influencers and exchange for my honest opinion.

186,ere perez,beetroot cheek & lip tint,pimprod2029283,2588787," * Easy fun light stain.  Lasts better than lip gloss/stick. * I liked the idea of a clean lip stain and was excited when I read the reviews. This product did not work for me as it was watery when I applied it, not staying on my lips and staining my front teeth. Disappointed as it was quite costly. * I've been looking for a lightweight but vibrant lip tint that wouldn't come off, and I finally found it. Most lipsticks don't last long on me, so I have fo constantly reapply. With this one, it stays in place for a long time. I usually apply a little bit of tinted lip oil on top, and it's perfect. I will be waiting for more shades! * I appreciated this cheek and lip stain for how pigmented and long lasting it was on both my cheeks and lips. I put it on in the morning and was out in the sun all day and it was still very present on my skin and lips when I got home several hours later. 

The stain is very easy to use on lips, but more difficult to use on cheeks. Having largely used cream blushes, it took several uses to get adapted to the lack of blend-ability for this product. I also need to find another applicator to try to use, as I usually use my fingers to blend out products and as an applicator, but this product stained them. 

I do really appreciate the high quality of both the packaging and the product itself, as well as the mission of the brand Ere Perez and this product as a whole. * I used the Beetroot Cheek and Lip tint primarily as a lip tint. WOW did it last!! Initially when applied to the lips it gives a very vibrant coral pink and red hue that is a little too overwhelming for my taste but when I wiped the lip tint off with a towel and pursed my lips together moving the lip tint around it was a beautiful shade that was perfect for summer.
A Tip- the tint is extremely long lasting (By long lasting I mean almost all day with eating and drinking), with that being said it is also somewhat staining. Precisely apply because I found out if I got it out of where it should be applied, it did not easily wipe off and the stain was still there along with my lipstick for a lot of the day. Also be careful on what the lip tint gets on (fingers, clothes, porous countertops, etc) as it is difficult to get off.
This review was collected as part of a promotion. * The Ere Perez beetroot cheek and lip tinted came in the color Joy. Joy is a bright cherry red color that has a bit of an orange tint to the color. The applicator is strong and not flimsy. When applying it on my lips it went on smooth and covered a good portion of my lips with one swipe. As the product is a tint multiple layers were needed to cover the area and have a build up to be an even layer. The product is light weight and because of that it feels as if you aren't wearing anything on your lips. The color is bright and very pigmented and because of that I choose to not try it on my cheeks. I tried it out after eating and learned that it does not fade evenly. My lips did feel hydrated and unlike other tints didn't have a dry feeling. The finish is a bit glossy rather than a matte color. * As someone new to the world of tints, I was so excited to try this. I was curious to see how it would compare to traditional blushes and lipsticks. 

Starting with thr basics, the packaging: it is sleek and minimalist, which I appreciate. The compact size makes it easy to carry in my purse, perfect for on-the-go touch-ups.
Applying the tint was straightforward, even for a beginner like me. The product glides smoothly onto both cheeks and lips. I found that using my fingers to blend the tint gave me the best results, providing a natural, flushed look. The color is buildable, so you can go for a subtle hint of color or a more dramatic pop, depending on your preference. It left mr with a vibrant, rosy hue that looks very natural on my skin. I got shade ""joy"" which i was worried would be too bright and clownish on me. But it turned out to be a versatile shade that I think would complement a variety of skin tones. The texture is lightweight and not sticky, which I loved. It feels comfortable on the skin and doesn't dry out my lips, a common issue I've had with other lip products.
I was also quite impressed with the staying power. It lasted several hours on both my cheeks and lips without the need for reapplication. Even after a meal, the color on my lips faded gracefully, leaving a nice stain rather than completely disappearing.

Overall, I am thrilled with this product! As my first foray into tints, it has set the bar high. The ease of use, natural finish, and impressive longevity make it a fantastic addition to my makeup routine. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile, high-quality tint that enhances natural beauty."
187,iconic london,sheer blush natural cream blusher,pimprod2015251,2563077," * I see some people claiming they're light and Rose Riot doesn't show up on them, but I'm pretty pale (my range is typically NC15-NC20) and it's one of the prettiest pale skin friendly shades I've ever tried. I either use my fingers or elf's putty blush brush, maybe people are using a sponge which could sheer it out too much. * I love the product hate how it comes out! * This blush disappeared on my skin, even though I am very light.  I tried to build it up, but couldn't get color payoff.  I've been much happier with liquid blush from the drugstore.  You might have better results with a darker shade than Rose Riot. * I purchased the shade cheeky coral. I have light to medium skin and it does not show up on my skin at all. It breaks apart on my skin then disappears. Ive tried using a sponge, brush, putting it directly on my cheeks, putting it on the back of my hand and no luck :( the color is beautiful though! Does anyone have any tips and tricks on how to get this product to show up and stay on the skin? * Had rhis on my favorites page for a year and extremely disappointed. First use, way too much product came out that i had to waste. Does not blend well, have to use an additonal blush to blend into face. * Perfect finish, can use it alone or layer with a powder blush. It doesn't move my base products around and it doesn't exaggerate my poor skin texture. Ive used multiple brushes to see if it would change the look or finish, but it always blends seamlessly. Highly recommend * I'm not much for make up, so switching to a liquid blush was intimidating but it's pretty easy to use!  You can layer up on how much you want the color to pop, and it stays on an oily face like mine ALL DAY.  I get compliments every time I wear this stuff! 
It's not a crème consistency, so careful with how you squeeze the tube!"
188,milani,cheek kiss cream blush trio,pimprod2030332,2590469," * . * The colors online do not match what I received. The bright pink is not as bright and the other two are more mauve and are very similiar to one another. 

Balmy texture that feels completely weightless on tbe skin and easy to blend but I am disappointed with the colors. I'm still on the fence if I should keep. * Balmy formula that sinks into your skin and blends so easily! I use it as blush and as a balm and loved it. Great for summer heat. * You have to layer on the pigment a million times. I normally like Milani products but this blush is a no go, still prefer prestige brands Blush sticks. * I love, blends so beautifully. So creamy! Can add more for more color tone! Never patchy. My favorite ever, all I do is recommend * Wonderfully creamy, beautiful colors * First, this handy little palette definitely gets the job done and on a pretty good range of skin tones; however, more shades are needed! These powders have a luxury feel to them. Almost buttery, a little can go a very long way! That being said, if you have VERY light skin tones, you're going to want to go in with a light hand and build! On the other hand if you have dark skin tones, you're going to be able to load up your brush and apply. They do build nicely; still though too much of a good thing is too much. So while I absolutely love this concept like the many ""multiple steps palettes""  out there, it's not a one size fits all. Unfortunately finding that one size fits all is extremely hard to find in this department; that's the beauty of people being different! 
In the end, it's a fantastic little palette that I'd highly recommend; especially in an MUA bag or any makeup lovers collection that could benefit from these shades. Great price for great formulas. Now let's see more and more."
189,j.cat beauty,blush-mallow soft blusher,pimprod2014270,2564789," * Alot pigmentation,  long lasting. * There's a lot of color payoff with just a little swipe, so be careful. You do get a lot for what you pay, which is great. I should point out that Dolly Peachy is actually more orange than it is peach. So if you're looking for something more peachy, this might not be it. I'm very happy with my purchase and I'll be getting other shades. * For some reason I was thinking that this shade would be a lighter version of Thank You Berry Much, but it's straight up copper shimmer, like some kind of bronzer from the early '00s. Maybe it'll make a fun eyeshadow? It doesn't help that the larger picture of the shade isn't even the correct shade. Please fix this, Ulta! * I have a medium-tan, neutral skin tone. The formula is a nice soft matte and it easily picked up on a relatively dense synthetic brush. Thank You Berry Much! is nowhere near a berry color. It's more like a muted, deep coral, verging into terracotta/clay territory. Berries N' Cream is a true berry and is very pigmented. I have to use a sparse brush in order to not deposit too much color. I think it would show up great on deeper skin tones. * I bought the shade Baby Mochi, and use this as an eyeshadow rather than a blush (too deep for me). The formula is a little putty like and reminds me of CP SS Shadows. Super pigmented, super smooth. Would recommend 👌 * Quality is sooo good! * I love this blush and it was so cheap. It lasts really long and the color is beautiful"
190,physicians formula,butter believe it! blush,pimprod2034051,2592826," * This blush is another example of PF's great products. It goes on softly—no clown cheeks! A good choice for fair-skinned people who want a flush of color. And for a powder, it really is creamy. Lovely texture that goes on smoothly and evenly. No splotchy color. A quality product at a fraction of the price of high-end brands. * I have spent forever looking for a blush that looks natural on my fair skin without making me look sunburned.  This blush goes on light, but is buildable. It even looks pretty without foundation on.  I love the little brush it comes with. * Pink Sands gives a beautiful silky finish to a bare face or as a light brush over foundation. I dont use it as a blush, its so pretty as an all over look. Very soft look for my dry face. I've been using pink sands version for years. * just wish the color payout was a little better. I had to rub my blush brush really hard and many times into the pan and build to get much color on my skin. It's a beautiful shade, though. If you're looking for something subtle, this would be great for you. * I like the color ok but wish there was more actual product. Included is a tiny brush and mirror that will never get used. Too much packaging. * i'm a blush fanatic. i love trying new ones. i also love physicians formula. i had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately there's little to no color payoff. i was highly disappointed. i want to like it, but i'm afraid i just don't. * Pretty buttery and gives a subtle glow. However this shade would only show up on fair to light skin."
191,essence,electric glow colour changing lip & cheek oil,pimprod2040239,2611070," * I am asked so often as to what I put on my lips that make them look so wonderful and this product is that answer. I have bought this several times to gift and will continue to do so. * The product is great for the price, i use it mostly on my cheeks and it gives me a nice flush, i do think it feels a bit thin on lips but I usually put balm on after, overall for the price its worth it. It also rated good on yuka. * Feels like olive oil on your lips drys out i like the color but not for me * It puts tint on my lips and stays once it's dry. It works better than my $30 lipgloss * I have very pale lips so when I tried out this and realized that it stained very well and very pink it was game over for all other lip stains! It also lasts a very long time and I really recommend putting a clearish pinky lip gloss on top and it looks flawless.! * The gloss changes to a super pretty natural pink color, however, it was very drying to my lips. * As a fair, warm olive complexion, I struggle with finding pink blushes/lip colors that don't look like I'm channeling my mom's look from the 1980s. Even though this turns incredibly pink on me, it's a pretty natural-looking flush.

This product works great as a blush, especially if you're into sunburn or igari style blush application. I recommend applying with fingertips (wash after unless you like pink fingers) or a sponge (which will be hot pink forever after, no matter how much you wash it). Despite the instant, permanent stain on my beauty blender, the blush is pretty forgiving and buildable over a sunscreen or primer — definitely need to be more careful over a tinted moisturizer or foundation, though. 

I don't love using this alone on my lips, as it is definitely a bit drying and has an almost soapy taste to it, but it settles in quickly and acts more like a lip stain than a gloss or oil. I like to add a lip balm or gloss over the top for  a moisturized, just-bitten look."
