Feeling Butta builds up way too quickly and is next to impossible to blend out if you apply too much. Its a gorgeous sun-kissed color with a bit of sheen, but I've had to remove all my face makeup and redo it multiple times. * This blush is PACKED WITH PIGMENT. Literally, one very light-handed touch of your brush into this blush deposits SO much color. While this color payoff is great, manipulating it on your skin takes a lot of effort because the pigment stays put. Do NOT buy online because the colors are different than the packaging. * Soft feminine colors that last all day. Love the sturdy case and quality of the powder. * Soft feminine colors that last all day. Love the sturdy case and quality of the powder. * Smells soooo good and definitely works good"
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,perricone md,no makeup blush,pimprod2004408,2541775," * This is by far my favorite EVER blush!! I have goofy combo skin and some fine lines-this blush goes on so nicely and it doesn't make my face look more oily in my t zone and it does not settle into drier skin and lines! Absolutely worth the price and I hope they never stop making this blush! * I love this and the color but it used to have spf in it. Now it's just a regular blush. I noticed the brand has been doing away with the products being spf. Which is a shame since that's the reason I stocked up in early spring. Now since it has no spf, I am in no hurry to purchase. I still miss there spf gloss that used to be this color. * I've been using this blush for over a year now and I love this stuff!  I have dry, flaky skin and using powder blush accentuates my dry spots. This blush gives me a beautiful glow with some added moisture.  Long lasting and beautiful! I really think this blush would be good for all skin types especially dryer skin, a little goes a long way! * I love this blush in the summer when I need a bit of a boost on my cheeks for going out after doing some sun loving activities. I have sensitive skin, so when working outdoors I can only have sunscreen. Due to the sunscreen in the blush this helps being able to put some neutral makeup on for work without the risk of my face getting sunburned with regular makeup. I love the neutral color. Perricone MD used to sell an spf lipgloss in this color as well, I wish they brought back the lipgloss as it smelled great and worked fantastically. * CONS 
1. This blush burnt my skin. 
I applied the blush almost daily for several months. 2 weeks ago the skin on my cheek bones where the blush touched (in the exact shape I apply my blush) got a terrible allergic reaction: painful, red, extremely dry and bumpy. It has been several days of using soothing skincare, and the irritation is still there, although very slowly subsiding. 
2. As other reviewershave mentioned, the cap cracks easily when you screw the top closed. 

PROS 
The shade is buildable and starts very subtle. I have light skin, cool undertone, and this blush looked beautiful. * i only used this once or twice. i screwed the cap on too tight one time and the lid breaks and the stopper sank to the bottom. please replace the cheap plastic with metal. * I love the color of this blush and it blends beautifully. Big drawback though is the packaging. The lid completely cracked when I tightened it. I love this blush but now I can't take it anywhere. Please fix this packaging!!!!!"

Dusty rosé is pretty much it, but even it is a bit ""louder"" than I'm used to. One dot on each cheek is more than enough! Then I use a brush to blend it in. * I really wanted to love this product since I really love the elf halo Glow blush I got the elf Halo glow in the shade berry radiant and got this one in the shade berry well thinking it would be similar... when I put it on it was just too much, I put a super small dot and it's still was just too much I look like a clown with this on it doesn't blend well and it's really dissappointing... * This blush is AMAZING! Its very easy to put on and very pigmented. Every shade is beautiful and it melts onto your skin when you apply it. I have this blush in the shade ""pinky promise"" and it gives me a very glowly and natural look on my naturally tan skin. However, this blush doesn't last very long so I recommend putting on at least 3 dots of blush so it can last quite a while. This is very good blush and I would recommend it to anyone. I will definitely be purchasing it again! * I would recommend blending it in well in order for it to look good, 10/10 for sure, you have to buy, please like fore points! * Totally trying out other colors and repurchasing! Super pigmented so a little goes a long way, very easy to blend I use a brush. * Leaks but very pigmented and good cuality for price * The pigment is perfect"

I bought cherry, and i thought it would be a big size but when it came in it was small. This made me think it was not worth the price, I would recommend this to a rich friend. This is a 4. * I was iffy about this blish since some reviews are negative but i decided to try it myself. It's actually pigmented and vibrant! I use a liquid blush before than too it off with this one and it stays all day! Love love love * This is a beautiful blush. I bought Rosewood. * I was disappointed with this blush. It's not exactly on the cheaper end and it's small. I bought mahogany and it makes me look dirty or muddy no matter how lightly I put it on. So sad. * Dont get the light pink i applied it a few times and i never got to see the color, over priced and has no pigment * Not as pigmented as expected, Cherry isn't as red as shown in pictures.

Get this!!! * I wish I could give it a five but as my cons say it drys a little bit to quickly for me but otherwise I love it * omg i will not stop recommending this to everyone. i have convinced so many ppl to buy it and they love it. this is the bestttt blush ever. im halfway done w this bc i wear it everyday. i like blushes that stay on all day and this is it. i tried the other colors but i dont like them the same as i like this color! i really recommend. please try it out * I recommend this product as a tint! It tints instantly and leaves a perfect color. Easy to use and good for beginners. * too expensive for the amount you get. Plus ulta beuty has the same thing for only $10 and it last longer * The benefit rose tint is the best lip stain ever. It's long lasting, it's not drying, it's buildable and it's hydrating. The wear down is gorgeous and last all day. * It's not a stain at all it wears right off. It's is to liquidity  that it doesn't stay on my top lip it settles in between my lips,  if I'm explaining right. And it's just bad.."
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,nars,blush,pimprod2044741,2621261," * Orgasm 777 requires so much on the brush to show up on my face. (My skin tone is light to medium) For the cost, it's not pigmented enough. Like many others, I've been a longtime user of this beautiful blush in the color Orgasm. I've probably purchased 100 over the years and recommended it to everyone. I understand reformulating to remove talc (which never bothered me, btw) but WHY change the color and/or put so much shimmer that it takes WAY more to even show up on my face?
I need another blush. * I had the old formula in Orgasm and didn't like it; too dry. This new one is almost creamy and has much more pigment. I bought the shade Rush, which is perfect with my tan, a sort of cross between blush and bronzer. Overpriced so I can't give it a 5. * The new formula is talc free, but not nearly as pigmented. The swatch of Orgasm is super disappointing. Shimmery but extremely sheer. Orgasm X is now closer to the old original Orgasm. I'm so sad because I am almost out of Orgasm. I don't think I will be repurchasing. * This is a good product just not pigmented. Good shade range. * Recently bought a new Orgasm blush as like my umpteenth replacement and am so unhappy with what the new formulation has done to this blush I've used for like 20 years.  It seems to have lost most of the color and is just now a rather poor gold powder with a chalky pink cast over it. And it doesn't pick up well onto the brush or even the finger for that matter. Really bad. So sad to have lost my favorite standby. Attached a photo of the last sample size I have of apparently the old formula/color, and what i just received and will return and hunt for a new favorite blush for my medium olive skin. * So happy NARS is now Talc Free! Use to wear years ago but had to stop since I was allergic! Found another blush that I wore for years and now that's being discontinued and I had to find another new blush.. I am low girl when it comes to makeup and I got the color behave and it's beautiful and suits my skin tone…. * I was looking for the perfect cool pink blush for my very fair complected face and I found it! Although the shade is very intimidating to look at being that it is a very bright pink (I visited an ULTA to swatch before purchasing), it is absolutely stunning on the skin! Yes, there are so many other options out there but NARS knows blush like no other IMO. 🏆 This blush applies very smoothly, it is not chalky, and gives a beautiful pink finish over my bronzer. This shade is STUNNING……🤩🩷👏🏻"

It made my skin sooo dry I returned it so i got my money back * i would recommend using a wet beauty blender if you have trouble with blending it in * It's so so soooo glowy and beautiful, perfect for summer or very light makeup days, a little expensive but it's worth it, it layers really  well too. * I have been wanting to try this blush for a long time and I'm mad I skipped on it for so long! I love everything about it. Its easy to apply, easy to blend, very natural looking and you can't feel it on at all. - I got the light pink since I'm very fair skin, but I need more colors!! * If your the type of person who wants a faint blush that you can still see freckles under this is for you. It lasts all day if you use enough and its cute for a sunkissed look. * It is nice if you want something moisturing your sking but the product collects dust and dirt a lot so you need to clean the top layer of it often. It also doesnt last long. I tend to use this one first and then add another blush to make sure it says longer. The color and feeling is very nice and easy to blend. It looks very natural"

I am very fair and have a neutral to cool undertone and the shade berry was a beautifully natural pink blush for me. I have also used it on my eyelids as a eyeshadow which I have liked to coordinate my lip, cheek and eye color. * such a great shade. soooo creamy! great price too * These were my first two PUR products. I was won over by the creaminess with light coverage. I have shades Bronze Babe I use for contour. Then I have Berry Blast I use for blush. These are very versatile sticks can use for face, eyes, lips. They spread well and if you need more color, then just add more. Absolutely obsessed with these. * Saw these with Jamie Greenberg so I bought today in store. Literally soooo blendable. A dreamy product. Great price. * I purchased the Berry Best and it glides on smoothly and so easy to blend in with my fingers.   Color is great! * This brand is sooo under rated. I am truly obsessed with this stick in Coral Cosmo!! It is the perfect peachy coral for spring. So buildable. * Has a gorgeous finish by itself or worn over foundation, and blends easily with fingers or a sponge. I got the shade ""berry best,"" and it is such a pretty color."

I highly recommend it!!! * the bottom shade is so cute on the skin. my husband says it makes my face look younger lol it's the best cool toned pale pink because it lasts all day and easy to use. I like the powder more than the liquid because it's easier to apply * I love it. I really do recommend it, plus it'll last very long lol. * omg i love this powder blush! i barely tap my brush on the palet and theres still so much pigment!! i loveee the good quality for such a reasonable price, especially compared to other high end blushes! * I love the colors of the blushes. * Literally last you all day and doesnt melt off unlike these other blushes ive tried before ive had it for 6months and stil have so much product looks brand new its super easy to work with * affordable, matte but not dry, pretty colors"

I use it over a cream to powder foundation and it works like a charm. However, it is very pigmented so be careful with your dips. Start light and build up. * picked this up during in-store event. I find it very easy to blend with sponge and lasts throughout the day. very happy! * These blushes are terrific. Great price point for a super creamy blush that lasts all day long and has a ton of pigment. Huge thumbs up. * I wanted to give this a try, it's a pretty balmy blush but find it challenging to apply evenly with a brush at first and the color seems to fade. * This has become my new favorite blush! The application is so smooth and you can go from very subtle color, to a nice true to pan color bold blush. It does apply best with the new sponges that were released the same tome as these. The color is long lasting, if you dont want the dewy finish, i suggest setting with a powder blush of a similar color. I also have sensitive acne proje skin and this product does not break me out so that is another positive. In a world full of cream/liquid blushes this one has high quality performance at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend these! * I absolutely hate writing reviews but when credit is due credit is due and listen, credit is due! This is one of most amazing products to date! Flawless! * Nice color just found it a little sticky."

After purchasing this during one of the sales, I'll never go back. I have both Candy Clouds and Golden Hour. It is quite pigmented so a little will go a long way. The blush blends seamlessly and I will keep it in my make up collection. I highly recommend! * I have 2 of these and I live them. Super cute packaging, nice scent (chocolatey), blurring, and gorgeous shades. Candy clouds is my favorite shade and blush ever * Love everything I purchased * okay so i like this blush because the color is cute, its more of a natural finish and the packiging is just mwah but it is so hard to open (the bronzers are the same packigining but easy to open) and it has a not bad but not pleasent very strong smell to it.

P.S. the smell might be different from person to person because it didnt smell bad to me it was just very strong but my friend said she hated the smell of it and it was too strong. * i loved it!! * You just need a little bit of thos blush, it lasts all day long, blends really well & smells great.

Holy smokes!!! I don't think I have used anything as pigmented as these!! I have to actually dot it onto a paper towel and then work into my brush before applying to my cheeks to make sure I don't overdo it. These are beautiful and truly last alllllll day! * Really need very very little to use. Be careful. * Honestly get it now. It will literally lasts you a life time, it sit gorgeous under powders or by it self, AND THAT PIGMENT DONT PLAY. Just get it, thank me later💕‼️ * 100% my favorite liquid blush on the market. you only need a very small amount to cover the entire cheek so it makes the bottle last forever! the pigment is CRAZY and lasts all day on my oily skin. its super blendable and buildable to your liking. cannot recommend this one enough. in * I bought the blush in the color ""blush lily"". Its very pigmented and easy to blend. It last long if you set it with setting spray. I wish if had some shimmer in it though. * This. Blush. Is Fantastic. I use it for cheer, and it lasts ALL. NIGHT. I have quite pale skin, so it doesn't take much product, but people with darker skin would love this because the pigment is HIGH POWER. They have plenty of shades and even finishes for everyone. This is my favorite. I have Peach Rose, but it's more pink than peach, however I still am OBSESSED. * You only need the tip of the applicator to have a blushed look I've had mine sice last christmas and the label has rubbed off but I got the shade rosey posey and it is just like rare beauty shade happy LOVE IT"

The blushes are gorgeous!! Pigmented and beautiful! I kind of compared the blushes to the new rare one, but i like this better. I really recommend this palette, if you can find it, run for it! * I was so excited to see Tartes new glow bar the colors are perfect for summer * The blushes and highlighter in this palette are pigmented and gorgeous!!! * I bought this and have been lovong the sparkling blushes and the highlighter. These are super pigmented and pretty for spring and summer * I was hesitant to order this palette seeing there wasn't any reviews & also knowing the lack of tone range within Tarte's line however....this is beautiful!! I ordered the 'Berry Bar' ((darker one)) and it does compliment my skin tone perfectly, which is medium to tan in most makeup lines. I can get A LOT of color payoff using a light hand,  every color has a dewy glow, and lasted thru my 10 hour work day. The only critique I can imagine would be the bronzer not working for anyone darker than a tan skin tone. If you have a deep color, the bronzer may just give you a pretty glow without a pigment. Overall, I really like this palette thus far & can most def see me reaching for this more than not!"

The design for the container is also bad because it spills everywhere. * not terrible but patchy and not much pigment * The product itself is okay. I liked the shinmer. The packaging, however is completely unpractical. If you stand it up on its lid, it gets EVERYWHERE! I traveled and had to wipe the product off all of my other make-up. It even leaked out just standing up still on my counter. I tried storing it upside down, which prevented the leaking but then the product would barely come out. Just awful. * This was very easy to blend. It is an amazing product. I use every day. Amazing colors and pigment. I really like this product and i recomend it * Bought Rose You Slay on recommendation of Nikki La Rose on YouTube. Beautiful color & shine that lasts all day on my 54 yr old skin. Applicator does get messy & a little product goes a long way, so I press a small bit into the sponge tip, then swipe my blush brush across it. Applying with a brush works best for even application. I choose this inexpensive blush over my Hourglass & NARS every day. * This product is horrible. The blush is not a nice liquid & comes out of the wand uneven on your skin. Trying to use the wand to even out and blend is impossible—it just smears the sticky stuff around. Had to throw it away. Rip off."

Super creamy and easily blends. The case is cute and works great and the product lasts a long time even with daily use! * Love this hybrid gel cheek duo * I purchased the Grapefruit and Caramel color. I tried it out with my fingers and a brush.

The good;
-Pretty colors. They swatch mat but do blend out sheer and become part of the skin. 
-Elegant formulation with a creamy and light feel on the skin. 
-Easy to use, compact and portable.
-No discernable scent. 
-Neither the bronzer nor the blush have any glowy particles. 

The not so good;
-I am fair but cool toned and ALL the colors are warm on me. Why Stila, why? 
-Once applied the blush and bronzer become sheer and the colors disappear as they blend in. 
-I had to do multiple layers before I could truly see any color payoff.
I am tempted to purchase a darker color combination just so it would show up. 

Overall this is a clever, very convenient, and  portable product. Perhaps great for on the go touchups. But it is so sheer and blends out on my skin so much that there is virtually nothing left. * I really like this Stilla Blush & Bronze Hydro-Blur cheek duo. It blebds well and looks so natural. Its not sticky or tacky at all. It doesnt turn orange color either.  Doesnt look fake. * Based on the photos, I'd have shied away from the intense shades but they really sheer out on my light olive skin so I'm so glad I saw them in person because I would've ended up picking a lighter shade (and I might do that, too). Loving the Guava! It is lasting longer than powder blush (even with a setting spray) and is super convenient to throw into my bag for on the go touch ups. I even dabbed some of the bronzer side on in my crease when I was out and my eyeshadow needed a little pick me up. SOLD!!! * Not nearly as good as the Dibs beauty version. Didn't blend well and came off within an hour"

I have somewhat fair skin but I self tan in the summer & this just gives off the most beautiful, glowy look on either way my skin looks. So blendable and the orgasm shade is beautiful! * I am an older woman, 77, and very few wrinkles. My skin is not dry. I'm very fair and powder blush just does not sit right on my skin unless it's a very light color. I am a retired makeup artist so I do know a few things about application of product. I decided to try a liquid blush or creme blush. I did a lot of research and found Nars Afterglow. I find just 4-6 dots in a triangle pattern from cheek to ear blended with a beauty blender looks great. Natural color and not garish at all. It stays all day long for me. I've used other brands that are cheaper and fairly good, but for me, this really works both colorwise and staying power. The quality is excellent. * I spent years looking for a pink liquid blush. My skin is olive and all products I had seen and used made me look orange. Nobody wants to look orange! I finally found NARS Afterglow. It was just what I wanted. I have been using it for 3 years and I now have a healthy glow instead of looking like I am wearing a Halloween mask. Thank you for this wonderful product! * As someone who loves blush and is usually lighter than the lightest shade of foundation for most western brands, this is the most perfect blush products. It is pigmented, but also applies sheer, which is perfect because a lot of products that have a base to them make me look like a clown. This adds such a beautiful, natural glow. I love it! * I purchased the lilac color and it is so beautiful, but the second you blend it, all the color is completely gone. Ive never wanted a make up product to work more than this one. The color was exactly what i wanted, and was unable to find in any other brand, but it completely disappears. I tried to make this work in any way i could think of but it failed. * Idk why everyone else is saying this product wears off after 2 hours, mine lasts all day!! I went on a very long hunt for a liquid blush that showed up on my tan/olive skin that didnt make me look like a clown. This stuff is by far the best!! 3 dots on each cheek and blend with a beauty blender, sooooo natural looking but definitely adds color! * Id say right now i have normal to dry light/medium skin.   Ordered 2 different colors and although both colors were beautiful neither of them stayed on.   I tried without primer, with primer,  with setting spray, with out setting spray i even tried layering powder blush on top. This does not stay on.   For the price i expected so much more.   I much prefer the elf camo blushes or juvia.  Those stay on so much better at a fraction of the cost."

My Mom said it's the prettiest blush she's ever seen on me... but I realized it does not last all day. I also feel that the ""pink"" shade looks slightly orange/peachy on me. All I wear underneath is moisturizer and then CC Cream so maybe I don't do enough to make it stay? Still beautiful though. * I love this blush. I use three dots on each side then blend with a blush brush and it gives me the perfect color. I've used it with multiple foundations and it has been perfect everytime. * I am shocked by so many people disliking this product. I love it! I use two dots and blend it in with my fingers. It seems a lot of people say it doesn't blend well with a brush. I use my fingers and it blends really nicely. I am very pale and got the coral one and love the pop of color it gives me. I was wearing a pink powder blush and wanted something different. This works great for me. * I love the texture and feel of this blush, it makes my skin glow * I use the tarte contour and highlighter like this and love them but this blush is not it for me. It feels like when I blend it's just all coming off on the brush or the sponge and I've tried both. I'll keep using it until I'm out but won't buy again. * I grabbed this as well as the bronzer and highlighter during the 1/2 off sale. Loved all of them! They blend in easily with or without foundation and look great. I used a thick brush to blend in and it gives that ""you but better"" look. My main disappointment was as I initially squeezed the tube to get product out, all three were easily 1/2 full or less. I would definitely repurchase…if I don't have to pay more than 1/2 price. For reference I am in my 50's and have very dry skin but did prep with skincare and spf prior to applying. * Glad I got this during the 50% off sale or I would have been bummed, bought two different shades, berry and rose, returned berry because rose looked more cool toned which is what I was looking for. when you put it on and blend it out, it doesn't look cool toned at all it almost gives a bronzy, red. It also blends out extremely patchy regardless of what makeup I have on underneath. Really wanted to love it and think the applicator's so fun but it just missed the mark I think"

I purchased Paris, Sydney and Palm Springs. I ended up returning Paris and kept Sydney and Palm Springs. They're very pigmented, easy to apply and the amount is controlled with a brush although fingers work just as well. The finish is a powdery matte and does not make foundation budge when applied. I will be repurchasing these when I run out. They're small and compact enough to bring anywhere! * I generally use a medium foundation and when i am tanner during the summer i end up in medium-tan or maybe a tan shade if i have the luxury of being out and about more than usual. Currently i am in medium and the Los Angeles color has this white cast, like putting flour on my face with the pink. Not my favorite. It does go on smooth. I will give the product that much. * Absolutely LOVE this blush stick. The color is pigmented without being overpowering, and it lasts well throughout the day. It sets quickly, so make sure you're ready to blend as soon as you apply * I love this product! The color Sydney is perfect. I'm light fair skin and blonde. Don't let the darker color scare you. * So glad I tried this beautiful blush. * I bought this for a good deal and I LOVE IT! I've never had a very good blush but this works perfect! I highly recommend this product! To be honest, works way better than the Milk blush sticks! * Its so mini and cute and its very natural looking"

Im sure its a beautiful color, but theyre both broken to the point where i cannot even use them at least once. Im returning both unfortunately. * This blush is absolutely beautiful!! Not only do I glow to the gods but it lasts!! I literally plan on buying them all!! * The texture freaked me out at first, but it's so light and creamy. It's great for my older skin. * At a certain point, I moved from powder to creme blush and I've tried most, this at the top. I apply this formula with a beauty blender and it goes on so well. Application is easy and the color (blush please) is subtle and perfect on my light to medium color skin. My only complaint? I'd love to see more colors! * I was searching for a product that blends easily and stays on...this is it * Bought this on a whim and loved it so much that i bought 2 more!! Blush please is my favorite on my fair skin for everyday, but they're all great! I put them over powder and they don't disrupt anything underneath, and they give my cheeks a very subtle but healthy glow. The blend is seamless and they have great lasting power with me working a 12 hour shift!! Highly recommend, these deserve more hype! * I have used SO MANY different blushes, but this one I can't get over! I got it in the shade blush please which given my fair completion, shows up more peachy. Its creamy, but works beautifully on both bare skin and powder which is why I love it!"

I have fair skin and this was so non existent on me. It was so disappointing. The highlighter is pretty but not worth keeping the whole thing. After setting spray the color was pretty much gone from both the bronzer and blush. I'm returning it. * The bronzer and blushes are a light pigment.  I can appreciate this for a quick everyday natural, no chance to over do it look but then they put Becca's highlight formula with it. Blinding and shimmery. It doesn't make for a cohesive look. * I have this palette in Back to Cali and love it. I'm fair-skinned with dark hair and these shades look amazing on me. I consider myself a novice in the contouring game and feel like this is an approachable option for my other newbies. The contour shade is a lighter color but it is also buildable. The blush colors are very pretty and easy to blend. I can't wait to try it in other shades! * I really hate this product. I typically love all the reccomendations i get but this, this was the biggest flop. 
It doesnt work at all! Barely leaves any pigment on my face (only after i wet it). Its completely awful and it sucks. 
Please dont buy this!!!! * I've used smashbox contour pallets for years and I've loved all the ones I've tried, the colors and pigmentation are great. I had been using the Cali contour and debated getting the same but decided to try this one. The colors are amazing! * Im not a huge fan of the blush colors but I like the contour color

Its not a great palette, its alright * I was so excited for this face palette! I got it in the Cali colorway. It swatches fine, and I swatched it in the store before I ordered it online. The ones in the store are open all the time, so I didn't notice a smell then. But when I open the one I bought, there is such a strong scent of old perfume mixed with old crayons that I can still smell all day after applying it on the face. The lid won't stay open, it flops right down no matter what I do. The highlighter is supposed to be champagne pop, but it isn't. I have an original becca one, and the one in this palette is chunkier, darker, and more peachy. The bronzer doesn't pick up well at all, I have to apply 5 layers before it starts to show, and I've tried several different synthetic and Japanese brushes. The blushes are patchy and none of this lasts on the face, it fades patchy as well. The blushes seem pigmented when swatched, but don't apply that way to the face. The formula seems like it's supposed to be gelee. I love gelee formulas, but this is a terrible version."

it is perfect to add to my peachy orange sun kissed desert glow routine. the pigment is unbelievable and the blending is a dream. i also love the idea of a blonzer, overall completely impressed and overwhelmed by this amazing staple! 💖✨ * Kiss of Pink is beautiful on!!! Great for everyday or heavier for date night! * I use this blush all the time rose is so pretty! Super luminous appearance and looks good on acne-prone skin. It also lasts literally all day! I have every shade almost !! * A pretty blush that you can build up. When I received kiss of pink I expected it to be... pink but it was more of a peach. It still looks good, I just wish it was actually more pink * I'm not sure how this hasn't gone viral, but this deserves accolades as a blush! 

It's VERY pigmented- I looked like a clown on first application, but when built up gives the most stunning flush of color with a little inner glow. I have copper and rose, but will get the other two deeper colors once they've restocked. For reference, I have tan neutral skin"

I love how easy it is to apply too! Thank you for the sample ulta I'm hooked! I ended up buying the full size product. * Love this product, it's so easy to use as an all over color for summer. Perfect amount of sun kissed glow. * Was looking for a new blush for Spring/Summer, and stumbled upon this at my local Ulta.  Clay?  What is this?  Gave it a try (my selected color is Seduce) - wow!  So natural looking, just the right about of color, and buildable for an evening out!  Apply it to the apples of your cheeks, but also to your chin, forehead (over your brows) for a sun-kissed day-time look - it gives you a lovely glow!  I have used other Tarte products, and really liked them, but this - I love it!  So glad I found it! * I've been using this blush for years! It's all natural which I LOVE and it looks so natural and it truly lasts for hours!!! People ask me all the time what I use!! Definitely recommend this!! * I give this blush five stars for the shade, Paaarty. The blush diffuses and applies to the skin well, leaving a well-pigmented and beautiful neutral, rosy, nude pink color on the cheeks. The shade I would recommend avoiding is Exposed, which is supposed to be a nude-mauve, pinky color, but unfortunately, the color payoff is not there. I'm not sure if there is something wrong with that batch, but I have had much-preferred results with Paaarty. * Love these new Tarte blushes! I bought Big Ego and it is a vibrant bubblegum pink. The color is gorgeous on my fair complexion. It has just the right amount of pigmentation. I'm going to buy other shades. Highly recommend!"

I got it in the shade pink pop and it is SO pigmented! * I wanted to love this blush, the color is very natural and it lasts a while, but its trickier than just a quick dab and im out the door, i am not precise on my makeup, i like doing my makeup fast and efficiently. I had heard alot about this blush, it seemed easy and the colors were beautiful, i gave it a try at first the application was easy, but the blending took a long time and i was getting impatient, i wasnt able to build & blend, but at last it set and i was fine. The following day i open it and the product was everywhere. I hate being wasteful but i had to wipe everything off because it was dripping, i had closed it tight after i used it so i was confused as to why it spilled everywhere. Color is gorgeous, the applying is what really sucks and the messiness of it, its hard to continue its use so i just stopped. * The cons about this product is that after one use it will get very massy and will spill and leak out of the bottle. In my opinion I would not recommend this product. * I have been spying this blush in Dream Pop for a few months and finally bit the bullet and bought it. I LOVE it. Its pigment is gorgeous and buildable. Lasts for hours. Hands down my new favorite blush. * This blush is actually the best I've ever worn. I have mature skin that tends to be oily with patches of flaky dryness. This blush looked amazing despite those flaws. I have both the pink and the red blushes and both are great for different reasons. I use the pink for ann every day flush. When I want to add a little bit more color, especially at night, I use the red. A little goes along way. 

I cannot recommend this enough. Excellent!! * I really like this blush.  I have tried a variety of liquid and cream blushes and this is good.  It is a little more matte than I would like and it dries quick so you should only apply it to one side at time so you have plenty of time to blend it out.  I recommend a beauty blender"

I love it so much and I tell all my friends to buy it. It is so pigmented in the perfect shade is "" new to u"". My one and only problem with this is that the packaging isn't protective enough, and the blush may crack if you travel with it and aren't careful. * Nothing about this blush worked for me so I returned it and bought a blush by Tarte instead. * I love everything from Colourpop!

31,31,31,31,31,31,31,31,31,charlotte tilbury,mini hollywood blush & glow palette,pimprod2043348,2619555," * I recently tried the blush and had mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the color was absolutely fantastic. It gave my cheeks a beautiful, natural flush that lasted throughout the day without fading. The pigment was rich, and it blended seamlessly into my skin, providing a radiant, healthy glow.

However, despite the gorgeous color payoff, I encountered a significant downside. Unfortunately, after a few uses, I noticed that the blush caused me to break out. As someone with sensitive skin, this was a major drawback. I had to stop using it to let my skin recover.

In summary, while the Radiant Rose Blush delivers stunning color and great wear, I would caution those with sensitive or acne-prone skin to be aware of potential breakouts. If your skin can handle it, it's a beautiful addition to any makeup routine. * This is one of the best blushes i have ever used! The blush is very pigmented and the highlighter is very nice on the cheek i also love how it has a mirror to! I love the packaging! * I am that girl that never has worn blush seriously in her life, and now I can say that I'm a changed woman! This product has blown me out of the water with how perfect the blush color is & how pretty the highlight pairs with it! It's going to be my new staple, as I'm already a Charlotte Tilbury fan! * this is such a good product, i love the packaging and the blush and highlight is stunning * I think the blush and highlight are pretty and I like that it is easy for travel. I also think its a good price instead of buying two separate. A little goes a long way! * I love this so much much!! The blush is very pigmented for me and it's beautiful! The highlighter is very shiny obviously totally recommend!😊 * I bought this about a month ago and use it almost all of the time. I really really love the highlighter, it's absolutely perfect. It stays all day. I am at work for at least 9 hours a day, and it is ston when I get home, I never have to reapply it. I also really love it because it really shows up, but not in a tacky glittery kind of way. I was struggling to find a highlighter that wasn't super glittery. The blush is really pretty. It is a coral pink shade on me. I have light skin with yellow warm undertones. The blush doesn't have great staying power light highlighter does, but it is still decent. I would definitely repurchase."

Bummed its not a true lip stain tho, doesnt even last an hour on me! * This lip/cheek tint is a great cheap alternative to the benefit one. It works great and leaves a very pretty pink tint to the lips. The only bad thing I have to say is when putting it on the cheek you have to blend it in quickly because it does dry down rather quick. Other than that it is a great product and would definitely recommend!! * The color is better than benefit, it applies easier than benefit, it stays on longer than benefit. But it splotches really easily * I bought this as a replacement for the Ulta Beauty Lip Tint and Benetint and this was the best by far. The color leaves the most gorgeous pink color and it stays on longer than other lip tints I've tried. It doesn't dry out my lips like other products. I would recommend not putting it on chapped lips because it will settle into the creases. * i wouldnt recommend the tint as a doop for the benefit tint, it does not blend well at all * i love this product but its too pink for me, this also does work well for the benetint dupe. * Great buy!"

Too expensive. * I have light olive skin and often have difficulty finding colors that aren't too warm or cool. Lychee is perfect! Lasts all day while also managing to look natural. Does not highlight acne texture. The dimethicone in many blushes breaks me out and it's hard to find a product without it these days, happy to find this! It's expensive with the compact, so glad refills are available. * I love this blush.

Thank you Ulta and Chanel * Dissapointing product. The color is gorgeous but the product itself is drying when applied to lips and bleeds easily. Haven't used it much on cheeks because it will not blend easily. * I'm filipino and have a lighter honey beige tone and the Vital Beige one looks so natural and glowy on my cheeks! It gives me a sun-kissed look if I put some on my nose. I like a dewy look which this product provides. * This is more hydrating than some very expensive lip masks that I use which shall remain nameless. I've put it on at night before and it really locks in the moisture into the next day. This is by far my favorite lip color to use in the winter as it's the most occlusive one I have found. Even after some of the pigment fades, the occlusives and emollients seem to last. The colors are super flattering and it both looks and feels extremely luxurious on the lips. Super high quality product that for me has been worth it. * Amazing color! Very saturated and gives  just a nice pop of color! BEAUTIFUL!! Will purchase again once I'm out."

I know pink has been trendy forever now, but that is not my style. I love warm tones and that kissed by the sun look. The shades I have are pigmented, but not hard to work with. I like to spread some on the back of my hand and use a brush to build it to my desired look of the day. I set all of my cream products so longevity has never been an issue. I have worn this all day outdoors in the hot/humid climate with no issues. I have also applied this over a set face with no issues. This is literally my perfect blush. If you love that sunkissed look I highly recommend. * love how blendable and light weight this blush is!! * Would like to see them expand their color palette * I hardly leave a review these days, and I was super hopeful for this blush. It melts super easy but just as easy it disapears. I kept putting more and more and it just would not show up as the color it is. Maybe it is just the color I got? (Sunlit) but no. Nothing works. Fingers or brush it disapears. I have so many blushes this is the worst one ever as far as durability and color payoff. * Wow is all i can say! I saw this in store but i hadn't heard anything about it. It looked pretty but I have SO many blushes, I passed on it the first time. But then I looked at it again and decided to try it.

I've always used a powder so it was a little bit of a learning curve but I am absolutely in love with it! * I'd been seeking something to help with a darker lip look but I didn't want the solid look that lipsticks provide and didn't want any greasy tinted lip balms.

Losing sales if you don't stock it. * I bought this blush in Pretty in Pink. It's much more peach or coral than I thought it would be, but it's so subtle, that I don't mind the color.  I like the way it looks and it is easy to use and is not over-pigmented as some blushes are. * I love a fresh, wind-blown cheek in the winter time. I was on the fence with the Merlot blush because it appears maroon online, but the color is a more reddish on the skin. You don't need much, as it has super pigment and lasts all day. The first day I wore it, I received a compliment saying how 'fresh' I looked. Win! I imagine this color is great on all skin tones because of the pigment. I also have Pretty in Pink, and that's a great spring/summer color. GEN NUDE blush is possibly is the best out there when it comes to lasting power. * The shade is darker and brighter than the one I bought before. I've used this blush for years and now can't. Don't know why they had to change it. * I was looking for loose blush powder in Beauty but can no longer find it. I am fairly happy with this color, I guess. The consistency is nice.. Beauty was a little softer color & more compatible with my skin tone. * I have light skin but I wanted something a little richer for summer and the MAUVE shade was perfect!  This is SO CREAMY it feels as good on as it looks. I have to use a light hand because it is pigmented but it blends in so nicely. I have used a sponge, a brush and my fingers and it works well with all applications.. I got a little heavy handed at first but I was able to take a sponge and fix it. It is a creamy formula and doesn't look dry or patchy. I will be getting a lighter color for everyday & winter use. * Shades purchased: On the Mauve, Strike A Rose, You Had Me At Merlot

Amazing blushes!! The absoulte creamiest powders with amazing pigment. I will say Strike A Rose was a little deeper than pictured but im not mad about it, just FYI. You Had Me At Merlot stole my heart though, i fell in love with the deeper tone after initially being intimidated because it is so wearable!

They have it swatched on 3 skin tones. I am more fair than any of them and it doesnt show up.

People have gotten so hyped up on these extremely over pigmented blushes. Buildable is where its at and these are amazing for that.

My new fave."
44,44,44,44,44,44,44,44,44,fenty beauty by rihanna,hot cheeks velour blushlighter,pimprod2045516,2625693," * idk why the other reviews are complaining about too much glittler/sparkle when its called blushlighter. its meant to have some sparkle. it's absolutely gorg and just gives such a beautiful glow to your skin. i dont think it brings out a bunch of texture either. i wish it would let me insert a picture so you could see its not overly sparkly, just a pretty glow. you probably dont even need highlighter with this but im extra and always add the fenty diamond bomb. id def reccomend this * really loved fhe packaging and color of the blush but the color does not pick up at all on a brush or beauty blender. you really have to pack it on but it looks streaky after applying so much. milani has a better glowy blush. * I dont understand all the bad reviews. These blushes are gorgeous.  I have Juicy Peach and it is gorgeous on the skin, great color for a pop of peach pink on cheeks!   Yes it has some glitter but not a crazy amount.  I highly recommend! * I have a medium-tan skin tone and I couldn't decide which shade to purchase so I got both Juicy Peach and Baked Peach. They are very similar so you definitely don't need both. Juicy Peach doesn't have a lot of base pigment, it is more like a ""blush topper"", however the glow that it gives the cheeks is stunning, like a peachy/gold reflect. Baked Peach definitely has more of a base color, more like an actual blush. Baked Peach is more pink, the reflect is pink instead of gold. They are both very pretty, depends what look you're going for. I would say even someone with a lighter skin tone could use the darkest shade, as I had to build up to get it to show up (aka not a scary blush) * I love this product for the shimmering glow and rich peach tone! I enjoy the sparkle and it applied easily. I bought the darkest shade. * I got the shade Fresh Peach. It is stunning. Perfect for fair to light skin tones if you want that beautiful light pink flush with gold highlights. When I put it on, it just lights up my face so perfectly with a beautiful glow. I love this and want to get the other colors. Can't get enough. * I wanted to love this so bad because I love the packaging. It looks beautiful in the pan but absolutely no pigment shows up on my face. I bought the lightest shade and tried to build it many times and I ended up really just looking kind of orange with all the gold glitter. Not flattering on my light/medium skin. Going to have to return. :("
45,45,45,45,45,45,45,45,45,r.e.m. beauty,hypernova satin matte blush,pimprod2044063,2613119," * I bought this blush on whim and I was super surprised! It applied beautifully and was long lasting! It is buildable. I would definitely recommend this blush * so i just got back from Disney World and the main goal of the trip was to try out a new water ride and I was super worried about my makeup staying all night. I decided to try mixing shades pinking of u and strawberry nebula together to get a cute ombre effect. so it ended up being that i rode the ride 6 times in a row. I was in all rows of the log flume and got absolutely soaked to the point where i was dripping. needless to say, when i got back to my hotel room, i looked in the mirror and was shocked to see that my blush still looked amazing after everything i put it through! not only did i get insanely wet on the ride, but i was also sweating from the heat all night, and the blush still looked fantastic!!!!!!!!! this is my new fav blush combo and IT LASTS!!!! * I feel like rem knocked this launch out of the park, i bought 2 shades of their blushes and they're so pretty on the cheeks, they have a blurring effect and theyre so pigmented, one of the best powder blushes ive tried in a long time * I purchased the Strawberry Nebula shade. My skin tone leans towards cool and this color complements it beautifully. I am medium light and I have to apply it sparingly otherwise it can quickly become overly bright. 

The blush formulation is a finely milled powder and applies a translucent veil onto the skin. The beauty of this formulation is that it sinks in and doesn't look like powder once applied. It  looks like a lovely natural watercolor tint on the cheeks. There is no highlight or sparkle yet it doesn't look dull or too matte.
It is easy to apply and blend as long as the skin is dry. Like all powders I wouldn't apply it on a taky or wet surface or it will apply patchy. 

I love powders for ease and quickness of application, but I don't love how many powders sit on top of my skin and look powdery/textured. I like the more natural look of cream and liquid blushes and how they disappear/melt with my skin texture. 

This blush fullfils my wish for ease and speed of application of powders with the natural veil look of creams and liquids.

I also like the compact it is cute and looks unique.

I did try some of the other colors in the line. Many are more subtle and less punchy. 

Overall I am happy with my purchase. * I have both rose on mars and pinking of you. It has good pigment and buildable. Packaging could be better since it's a little awkward to open. Scratch/chipped some of the blush trying to open it. * I have the shade strawberry Nebula. It's so pretty and goes on smooth. It's my perfect flushed shade, or slight sunburn shade … but that's what I go for. It's very pigmented so I go in with a light hand. It's gorgeous. I definitely recommend. * love the color (skinny dipped) the color glides on, and blends like a dream. This is a new staple in my makeup routine."

Super pigmented, blends like a dream and I love the subtle glow it gives. So beautiful. Will definitely be getting more shades. * I purchased the shade Soft Tulip Glow. This shade is the perfect peachy-pink with a natural glow. I find this formula blends better than the original Juvia's liquid blush. I don't have to fight to blend this blushlighter and I reach for it often. * This is the best liquid blush i own ( i have more than 100) you just need a tiny bit and blends smooth and last better than the rare one * I LOVE this cream blush. Initially from the tube and before blending, it can come off as a slightly garish coral pink - but after you swirl it with a face / blush brush, it's a very nice warm flattering pink that actually reminds me of NARS' Orgasm blush with the golden warm specks. The glitter specks is a nice subtle shimmer, not chunky large bits of glitter. If I ever run out of this (A little goes a long way), I really hope this is still around for me to replenish supply.
PS: I haven't applied this with foundation, as I rarely wear anything beyond concealer or tinted moisturizer on a fancy occasion, but overall, this is quite the lovely liquid blush! * It's so pretty and luminous. When using this I don't need highlighter and it makes my face look so fresh! It's the perfect summer color. * The color Blush Lily Glow (light cool pink) was constantly sold out at my local store and now I know why.  It's gorgeous!  I have light cool-toned skin and warm-toned blushes make me look ill.  This product is also very pigmented; I only need a couple of tiny dots on my cheekbones which I then blend out with a damp sponge.  It gives such a pretty glow that's not glittery.  Better than some liquid blushes that cost 2x-3x as much!"

It is the perfect shade for my skin and I like that it is buildable if I have a fake tan on. Worth the price and makes my skin dewy * I've always love color changing products.  THE BYO blush changes to my Ph levels and gives me the prettiest natural color.  The blush is not oily, you can reapply more than once.  I use the BYO blush on my lips and eyelids as well. * I love this blush such cute colors t * Love that this ph changing blush. Its will have unquir shade for every person which is very cool. It will always be perfect match shade * I really love the dewy finish of this blush, it leaves a radiant and healthy glow but isnt goopy or sticky to the touch. I only wish the color changing blush was more pigmented, i have a fair skin and it barely shows up. I know its supposed to react to my skins pH so maybe its just me. * It applies such a pretty pink on my cheeks, definitely recommend tryin it out! * doesnt blend easily and leaves a patchy finish🙅‍♀️"

one of the best priced blushes on the market now. * No complaints! Pigmented and easily blendable. Set with powder and you're good to go. * Such a good blush and tops most high end brands imo. If you dont like using a lot or are scared of having a very loud blush it might not be for you but for me i always wanted a very pigmented blush and i finally found it! * Very good blush it is very pigmented and can be used without a powder blush to go over it, and you can use it in your bade before adding your setting powders * I am a very fair skinned strawberry blond person who prefers a cream-style blush. Unfortunately, it's hard to find a compatible shade in a cream that doesn't sink into the skin. This one checks  ALL the boxes. It glides on easily, has amazing staying power, and the coral color provides a kiss of color on my fair skin that isn't orange or too red. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the hinge of the compact broke within a relatively short time. Even with this, I am still using it- a little tape fixes it. It lasts a long time as you only need a touch. It is a great blush that I will continue to buy. * super pigmented and it is easy to work with. i live how blendable this formula is and the shades are beautiful. love using this for layering my makeup products"

55,55,55,55,55,55,55,55,55,chanel,joues contraste powder blush,pimprod2030016,2579895," * The blush doesnt have any pigment ots powdery and the amount of product you get is noth worth the price. * The texture is very soft with finely milled pearl similar to the Hourglass pressed powders. It has a ""lit from within"" look thats not going to emphasize textute. I got it in the color Jersey which is between a rose and warm nutmeg. The blush is a light wash of color that can be built up, but its not designed for vibrancy. Great for those who want a natural blush thats not shimmery or completely matte. I find the color and texture true to luxury makeup. It has longevity, and stays on my skin through an 8 hour work day. 

If youre not into subtle formulas then this isnt for you. There are more vibrant blushes that costs a fraction of the price. If you enjoy luxury makeup or like ultra milled baked powder then this could be an option. * I like this color and texture * I love this !! Its flirty not to bright not to dark it's perfect for those that have olive under tone! * While I wanted to love this blush, I found the coverage was minimal unless I use ALOT of product.  For the price, I won't buy again. * I love this blush! A nice natural glow feels amazing and last a long time.

Using just a little gives me a nice peachy flush that lasts all day. It's buildable too if I want a bit of a brighter color. * Bought ""Fake the Flush"" because I needed to add something to get to a specific total. Its amazingly beautiful, blends so easily, not super pigmented ( with blushes, in my opinion, there's a thing as too much pigment  ) and less than $2.00, I was not expecting to love it like I do. * This blush did not have great reviews when I bought it and that's why I am here. Honestly, this product is amazing and I don't want people to pass it over. It is blendable, buildable, easy to travel with, plays well with others, and has a beautiful finish. It works well with my sensitive, acne-prone, and combination skin. I love this even more than the elf liquid blush, which tends to be so pigmented that you can overdo your blush easily. However, this blush is very beginner-friendly and you don't run the risk of looking crazy. I think it works best when blended gently with your fingertips. A very small amount goes a long way. Added too much? No biggie, just keep blending with your fingertips. One small drop is enough to cover both cheeks, so this will last you forever. 1st layer gives a 'sheer blush from within' kind of look. You can make it more pigmented with more layers. I will be purchasing more colors and keeping this as my new travel blush. The squeeze tube is about the size of a lip balm and the packaging is cute too. This is very multi-use. You can use it as blush, eyeshadow, or a subtle lip stain. An absolute steal for the price. But the quality is great and this is probably one of the best travel/beginner blushes you will find (regardless of price). * I was reading the reviews and i was really skeptical the bad ones made me not want to buy this product but i gave it a shot and im so thankful because its exactly what i wanted i dont know why people are complaining it blends in great and its a nice color it does kind if smell like sunscreen but 🤷🏼‍♀️ i dont mind. Definitely recommend * I purchased this due to the price bit this actually wowed me. I used it the day after I received the online order and was pleasantly surprised. I used a tad too much and applied the excess on my lips which really tied the look together * This blush is really pretty and I like to mix it with other blushes! It says it's liquid however it looks and feels more like a cream. * Its my favorite boush ever"

Its my favorite item to complete my new make up make up look. * I have tried forever pink and red. Red is like a bright reddish coral on me, quite warm toned - gave it away to a friend. Pink I kept. A nice, long lasting, moisturizing lip and cheek stain. Dewy/tacky for a bit on the cheeks after application. I have to note that I do not love the scent and it's strong. Fruity. Not something I could use if I had a headache. Otherwise a nice product. * This is a very pretty, natural looking cheek stain in the pink color. Glowy and moisturizing. It is easy to work with. It could be a tad more pigmented and last longer. * My absolute favorite lippie to wear! Gives a great colored stain that lasts all day, it's a bit expensive but it does work really well. It's not sticky at all, very smooth. Fingers crossed Jane Iredale comes out with more colors! * The tube of this product has a sleek design and looks high end/luxury. The  lip stain itself is very smooth, doesnt have any smell and glide nicely on lips. I brought both pink and peach colors and the pigmentation is sheer and natural, and the moisturing power is medium that can soften dryness of lips in certain level but doesnt completely sink down. I feel its a nice product for a daily use or going with a natural look makeup. * This is by far the best lip product that isn't as harsh as a normal stain, doesn't dry out my dry cracked lips even more- actually the opposite. The color is subtle, but 100% noticeable. Classy, chip, moisturizing & the perfect lip stain for a busy, workout, baseball fields every day- mom! Love! * I had high hopes for this based on reviews.  But it turned my lips a Pepto Bismol pink just like the old Frog Princess green lipstick.  My chemistry must be bad."

It's lightweight which is perfect in spring/summer but can be used in fall/winter to get rid of pale skin.  I don't need to use much. I highly recommend based on skin color. I'm a pale white girl and loved the color. * I decided to invest in a good blush that is high quality and wont break me out because I have acne prone skin. I love how it looks and it has a little shimmer. * Based on the reviews and price, I wanted to absolute fall in love with this blush. Using it alone, it was patchy by the end of the day. You have to use it as a setting blush on top of cream if you want to it hold. Not to mention, the packaging feels so cheap. Some of my drugstore makeup has better eye appeal and structure compared to this. It also comes with a disclosure to be careful, because it's delicate… Hmm I wonder why lol * I have 4 shades of this blush plus a couple of the holiday palettes, and it is my favorite blush formula of all time. You don't need to add highlighter when you use this. Depending on the shade, bronzer is also optional. You get a lot of product for the price, and there is no talc. It's almost impossible to overdo this blush as it is not super pigmented but still you don't need much to get the job done. There is no fragrance. It's just a well made beautiful product. Packaging is also super sturdy. It lasts all day even in hot humid weather and never looks dry or powdery or glittery. You just get a perfect lit from within glow. Everyone should try this at least once. I have repurchased a few of the shades at least a couple of times. Hourglass does powder products extremely well. * I have 4 shades of this blush plus a couple of the holiday palettes, and it is my favorite blush formula of all time.

I apply it with a dry sponge that has a rounded but somewhat flat bottom so my fingers dont get stained. This summer I'm all about the hot pink coral lips and cheeks because it imparts a vibrant and lively look to the face and I can keep the eye look simple with just liner, mascara and a neutral eyeshadow from lid to brow or none at all. There used to be a MAC cream color base called Virgin Isle and I love Electroball way more than that. I ordered the violet one this time around and hopefully it'll look just as fabulous. I'm also going to try it as an eyeshadow and see if it makes my brown eyes pop. * My NB son, 15, wanted to do his face (first time) to go to drag show and loves Pokémon. He's a perfect match to the palest Morphe foundation. I was afraid the cherry red Pikachu blush would be too intense, but it imparted the loveliest cherry red flush and I built it up till it was just amazing.

I have dry, flaky skin and using powder blush accentuates my dry spots. This blush gives me a beautiful glow with some added moisture.  Long lasting and beautiful! I really think this blush would be good for all skin types especially dryer skin, a little goes a long way! * I love this blush in the summer when I need a bit of a boost on my cheeks for going out after doing some sun loving activities. I have sensitive skin, so when working outdoors I can only have sunscreen. Due to the sunscreen in the blush this helps being able to put some neutral makeup on for work without the risk of my face getting sunburned with regular makeup. I love the neutral color. Perricone MD used to sell an spf lipgloss in this color as well, I wish they brought back the lipgloss as it smelled great and worked fantastically. * CONS 
1. This blush burnt my skin. 
I applied the blush almost daily for several months. 2 weeks ago the skin on my cheek bones where the blush touched (in the exact shape I apply my blush) got a terrible allergic reaction: painful, red, extremely dry and bumpy. It has been several days of using soothing skincare, and the irritation is still there, although very slowly subsiding. 
2. As other reviewershave mentioned, the cap cracks easily when you screw the top closed. 

PROS 
The shade is buildable and starts very subtle. I have light skin, cool undertone, and this blush looked beautiful. * i only used this once or twice. i screwed the cap on too tight one time and the lid breaks and the stopper sank to the bottom. please replace the cheap plastic with metal. * I love the color of this blush and it blends beautifully. Big drawback though is the packaging. The lid completely cracked when I tightened it. I love this blush but now I can't take it anywhere. Please fix this packaging!!!!!"

I was happy to find a clean blush with a beautiful color but the sparkles are too much. Will be returning. * Really like it! * I have used these little shimmery colored powders for years.  You can add them to your setting powder or use as an added effect after you're all done putting on your makeup. Really gives life to an older complex 
 ion! * I love the Bare Minerals foudnation and faux tan. The blush is pretty but… I have acne scars and the glitter excentuates these scars dramatically. It just doesnt look smooth. The color doesnt last either. I notice that it is gone within minutes of applying. Honestly I will stick with some of my drug store options. * I love the loose blush. I have been using it for years but miss the glee color. It was very popular because i always had a hard time finding it in stock. Why did you discontinue? * I first purchased this 10 years ago and have been consistently repurchasing ever since. Im fair skinned with neutral undertones, and the vintage peach shade is the perfect sunkissed glow on me. I've tried a TON of blushes, from drugstore to high end, and this is the one that is my baseline every day blush. As someone who's very fair, I love that this is buildable for when I want a more vibrant look. 10/10 * The loose powder blush is my go-to everyday product. It's getting harder and harder to find these days. Please don't discontinue this product, make more of it and more colors. I love this blush so much. I'm almost out of mine that I have and can't find it anywhere in store and online. I've been waiting for about 2 years now for Ulta to restock it. What's going on??"

Feeling Butta builds up way too quickly and is next to impossible to blend out if you apply too much. Its a gorgeous sun-kissed color with a bit of sheen, but I've had to remove all my face makeup and redo it multiple times. * This blush is PACKED WITH PIGMENT. Literally, one very light-handed touch of your brush into this blush deposits SO much color. While this color payoff is great, manipulating it on your skin takes a lot of effort because the pigment stays put. Do NOT buy online because the colors are different than the packaging. * Soft feminine colors that last all day.

I have a light - medium complexion and think the colors work for me. I don't find it orangey at all. The colors are very pigmented so a little goes a long way.

Oily skin people - I set these with powder and finish with setting spray to keep them from getting me too oily (I've got combo skin), but if you're very oily, these not be for you. 

Ulta - please make more shades and make an affordable version of Kaja's bentobox eyeshadow trios next! * I personally adore this one. Very lovely for a glow and skin like finish. Handy. 
The pigment is very nice. Does not last all day. This product feels like an oily tacky lipstick. Be advised based on your own skin texture :)). ....................... * I have melasma so trying to even out my skin tone is difficult, and always COATED in SPF which tends to make me look kind of dead. This gives my face life again - natural healthy looking color. The white spots at my temples are always impossible to bronze bc it collects in my hairline, gets splotchy. Idk why, but this DOES NOT. It has been holding up well in the summer heat. I think my face and head gets sweatier than most women's but still, this bronzer doesn't get blotchy or do anything strange when sweating. * This is the perfect stack if you like cream products! This stuff stays on my face all day. It's easy to blend, the color is nice, and it's compact so it doesn't take up space in your makeup bag. The only bad things about this product is I wish there was more product. * This is perfect for on the go to get the most beautiful clean girl makeup look and what I love the most is the beautiful berry toned blush I didn't own anything like it bit it is now my staple I hope this product stays around for a long time I love it!!! * I have little experience with makeup but this has been extremely easy for me to use. The formula is amazing and the product applys smoothly. I have no complaints whatsoever! * Now this is exactly what I've been looking for and all of the colors work for me.

You won't need a replacement for a long time. It also won't break up on you when it gets low. Nars does that to me almost every time. I love this product. It actually saves you money and the colors are beautiful. Now lets hope they don't get greedy, change the formula and mess it up. * I have the newer formulation in ""Nude Look"", and I love it.  I love how buildable it is.  For no makeup, makeup days it's great because you can make it be more natural looking.  I read a bad review on this page and said it was patchy?  It's not patchy on me at all.  Maybe because of different make-up prep?  I love this blush and definitely would recommend.  Yes, it is pricey, but if you want to splurge on a good blush…. This would be a great option. * I hate blushes that are so pigmented or just don't blend well meaning they aren't natural but this is so cute!

I've used products that cost half as much that felt more luxurious. Absolutely no color payoff and building it up makes it patchy beyond belief. This is going back tomorrow.

It's fantastic, better than other liquid blushes I have tried. When this sample is finished, I'll purchase a full size. It's richly pigmented, buildable, and natural looking. I can wear it without foundation. * I love this blush. I have been looking for a blush that goes on easy but looks amazing. it has a beautiful glow and the color is just enough. This is now my favorite. * I don't often write reviews but wanted to note that these are not a consistent formula across the color range. I've tried Coral, Pink, Buff, Berry, Raspberry and Strawberry. Strawberry is the one to especially avoid! It is sheer and doesn't glow like the other colors and maybe even wears away faster. The other colors have this great sheen with being shimmery. Coral, Pink and Buff are my favorite. If you like the glow wands but they're a little too shimmery for certain occasions you will love these! * As someone who has always struggled with applying blush on my face without looking like a clown, these are perfect. A tiny dot goes a long way and blends perfectly. * This was a gift * I was looking into yhe liquid blush because my power blushes come off as too ""cakey"" when blended this is my first liquid blush and in LOVE!!! I got the pink coral color and when I did the test on my hand i wasnt sure it was very ""barbie pink"" but when i put it on my cheek it just matched so well with my skin tone!! It looked amazing!! Im going to buy more now!! * I saw these blushes in store and swatched most of them and they were all so pretty, but the Peachy Pink was so beautiful but out of stock.

Never thought I would ever be one to wear blush. * I own 3 different colors and am in love with every shade. The finish is a beautiful skin like satin, tons of lovely shades that work on all skintones, stunning packaging, wtc * I got the Fleurtasious (sp) it is a beautiful beige pink and i have fair skin and it blends beautifully. * The prettiest blush for every skin tone. A bit pricey but you do get a bit more product than you would with other highend blush at this price point.  Also, a little goes a long way because the pigment is definitely there and the texture and application is so smooth. Love this blush (shade cherish) * Description says Divine Rose is ""cool mauve"" but it's warm toned. The packaging is plastic with the kind of clasp you have to push in to release the lid. It's annoying and cheap. The formula is... Okay? It took several tries to find a brush that really worked for it. Nothing groundbreaking.  Not at all worth the high price."

I've used up Bare Back completely and still use the In the Nude shade. Bare back is a more subtle, muted cool/neutral color. I really like it all year round! In the Nude is more peachy and a little darker so I like it in the summer with a tan. Cherry Blossom Babe is my newest one and im obsessed. Its a true bubbkegum pink color - so girly and light! Its a brighter Barbie version of Bare Back in my opinion. * Love! * I love this blush! I got the Cherry Blossom Babe color and it is very soft, feminine, and dewy! I like how it has a brush attached to it but the brush is not soft; the bristles are scratchy and are somewhat rough on my sensitive skin. I'd give this a 4.5/5 if I could.

I am truly obsessed with this stick in Coral Cosmo!! It is the perfect peachy coral for spring.

Love the 3 highlight colors. * Ive used this  since 2016 and i dont think it will ever leave my daily makeup bag. It makes my skin look smooth, glowy and natural. Its talc free so it doesn't settle into fine lines. Im fair so i use the colors individually to set, highlight and bronze. Theyre also beautiful as eyeshadow. Because they're baked, they also last forever. With daily use, i hit pan every year or so. * Stunning glow. Not shiny or sparkly, subtle and beautiful. I sometimes swatch by single color and sometimes just swipe my brush across all 3, then sit back and wait for compliments. Great for understated am glow too. Lost a star bc price prohibitive. Should be an everyday glow product but isn't for me bc of the price. * I'm on the fence with this product. I really wanted to love it. I have to use full coverage foundation due to hyperpigmentation and dark spots. So when I used this, I used it instead of my setting powder/pressed powder. Didn't really like the way it looked on me. Maybe I'll try using my setting powder first then this. If that doesn't work, then I'm probably going to return it. It's nice but it's not WOW factor. * I've purchased things for $5 that had better pigment and quality. * To be honest I don't used and I don't like the highlight shade though I love Dim and Radiant light which come along in this palette they both fits my need  Using Natural hairs brush (Sonia G smooth buffer / buffer pro ) is the best result / thanks for letting me share * Honestly I don't care about finishing powder so I have never used any .. More than 5 years I saw many YouTuber reviews and told things about HG ambient lighting palette which makes me wonder and more eyeing to try ..

Do know, the product packaging is cheap. But the product is sublime it looks natural yet adds that enhancement, and there is a slight glow to it. I have found other blushes are really heavy. This one is definitely buildable.  This can go from a day to evening look very easily and the price point I think is good given the amount of product you get and the look that you get when using it. * I was so excited to see Pat McGrath at Ulta! I chose the color Fleurotique and it is my absolute new favorite. I've used it everyday since buying it. I don't wear full makeup & enjoy a natural makeup look & this product is perfect for that. Works well with a tinted moisturizer or a heavier foundation with more coverage. I'm really hoping that she follows this with a bronzer that is similar! 
I love that my face doesnt feel greasy with this product like I've experienced with other similar products. It glides on easily, is easy to blend, and the color builds beautifully. * This looks so pretty on the cheeks.  It's easy to blend and to work with.  Also the longevity is great too for such a dewy finish.  I will say the glossiness of the formula on the cheeks fades throughout the day becoming one with the skin so the color is still there just the more natural. * I have medium dark skin and have had a tough time finding a blush stick that actually shows up on my skin without looking too much.  I've tried so many brands. I just discovered this brand and am sold.  The color divine rose in particular is beautiful.  The pink shows through and imparts a glow just like the product name says.  My skin is also uneven in color now that i'm in my 50s and it looks good even without foundation.  I also purchased the color fleurotique and it's nice but not as natural looking as the rose color."

Like you get the color and depth you want without trying to hard. * The shade ""audition"" is advertised as a ""nude pink"" - this is a WARM RED. Not a pink at all!!!! Wrong advertising. * I was looking for a balm that would work well on my cheeks and lips for the summer. I chose the strawberry color. It's definitely deeper than strawberry, but still pretty. It goes on smoothly on my lips and cheeks. Easy to spread for a flush of color. My provlem is that it has no longevity. It wears off very fast on my lips and doesnt last much longer on my cheeks.

Super creamy and easily blends. The case is cute and works great and the product lasts a long time even with daily use! * Love this hybrid gel cheek duo * I purchased the Grapefruit and Caramel color. I tried it out with my fingers and a brush.

The good;
-Pretty colors. They swatch mat but do blend out sheer and become part of the skin. 
-Elegant formulation with a creamy and light feel on the skin. 
-Easy to use, compact and portable.
-No discernable scent. 
-Neither the bronzer nor the blush have any glowy particles. 

The not so good;
-I am fair but cool toned and ALL the colors are warm on me. Why Stila, why? 
-Once applied the blush and bronzer become sheer and the colors disappear as they blend in. 
-I had to do multiple layers before I could truly see any color payoff.
I am tempted to purchase a darker color combination just so it would show up. 

Overall this is a clever, very convenient, and  portable product. Perhaps great for on the go touchups. But it is so sheer and blends out on my skin so much that there is virtually nothing left. * I really like this Stilla Blush & Bronze Hydro-Blur cheek duo. It blebds well and looks so natural. Its not sticky or tacky at all. It doesnt turn orange color either.  Doesnt look fake. * Based on the photos, I'd have shied away from the intense shades but they really sheer out on my light olive skin so I'm so glad I saw them in person because I would've ended up picking a lighter shade (and I might do that, too). Loving the Guava! It is lasting longer than powder blush (even with a setting spray) and is super convenient to throw into my bag for on the go touch ups. I even dabbed some of the bronzer side on in my crease when I was out and my eyeshadow needed a little pick me up. SOLD!!! * Not nearly as good as the Dibs beauty version.

I find it very easy to blend with sponge and lasts throughout the day. very happy! * These blushes are terrific. Great price point for a super creamy blush that lasts all day long and has a ton of pigment. Huge thumbs up. * I wanted to give this a try, it's a pretty balmy blush but find it challenging to apply evenly with a brush at first and the color seems to fade. * This has become my new favorite blush! The application is so smooth and you can go from very subtle color, to a nice true to pan color bold blush. It does apply best with the new sponges that were released the same tome as these. The color is long lasting, if you dont want the dewy finish, i suggest setting with a powder blush of a similar color. I also have sensitive acne proje skin and this product does not break me out so that is another positive. In a world full of cream/liquid blushes this one has high quality performance at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend these! * I absolutely hate writing reviews but when credit is due credit is due and listen, credit is due! This is one of most amazing products to date! Flawless! * Nice color just found it a little sticky."

I have super sensitive skin and this has no talc! Yay! * I was so glad that Bobbi Brown removed the lanolin from their blushes, but disappointed to see that they now contain coconut oil, which is pore clogging.  I know Bobbi Brown has dry skin, and I feel like all her products are made with dry skinned people in mind, but do not work well for people with oily or acne prone skin.  It's too bad, because I have had back luck with several of her products (her tinted moisturizer contains petrolatum, and clogged my pores).  Please make products that anyone can use! * I bought Desert Pink. It is a darker medium pink. The size was small and packaging seemed cheap. Would be good in a makeup kit because it's small, no bulk, and has a window to show color. It's buildable but the price is too much for what you get. When you pay this much for blush you expect a bit more. Pretty but the size and price are cons for me."

I'm  a medium brown skinned, 50 year old . These colors compliment me both ways * This is my 2nd time purchasing this palette & it's everything.  I especially like to blend the gold bronze and the pink bronze together. I use the morphe fan brush to apply and the rose colored highlighter brush to blend and it blends the highlighter and bronzer perfectly. Since I moved this product isn't sold in store so I had to order...that's the only thing that I don't like is that it's not sold in MN Ulta stores. * This palette is exactly what I was looking for, the colors are very pigmented, but it is a little hard to blend out well. The colors are fantastic; it has contour, blush, highlighter. Also, I use them as eye shadow. * This palette is horrible! The contour and highlighter do not blend easily at all. The highlighter has very chunky glitter. If I could give it no stars I would. * The blushes in this palette are soo pretty. The bronzers are warm and beautiful as well. Perfect for your kit. * This product is goood!!! I'm an MUA... and it's good for women of color * I have been looking for a bronzer for my deep complexion and wanted to try out a few shades before committing. This palette lets me do that. Both bronzers work nicely for me so I blend both. The contour is super pigmented so go in with a light hand. The matte blush shade is super pretty and I love the highlighters. Haven't tried the brightening powder yet. Would purchase again once I hit pan."

Feels very lux and has amazinf pigment * I really wanted to love this blush but its just like glitter barely pigment will be returning this * ive bought 3 of these blushes all at different times and i loved them as you can tell but all 3 of the tops have come off. pls improve the packaging. * I have fair skin and this blush has a really nice pigment it's not over powering, but…I can't get over the smell it has when I put it on my brush and after I wipe it off. * This blush is pretty sheer at first but when you add layers, it is a very pretty blush. * Initially, I had reservations about this blush after buying it. However, after setting my make-up and applying the blush, I was astounded by the beautiful pink shade. The pigmentation is remarkable, and a small amount of product goes a long way!"
91,91,91,91,91,91,91,91,91,nars,blush,pimprod2044741,2621262," * Orgasm 777 requires so much on the brush to show up on my face. (My skin tone is light to medium) For the cost, it's not pigmented enough. Like many others, I've been a longtime user of this beautiful blush in the color Orgasm. I've probably purchased 100 over the years and recommended it to everyone. I understand reformulating to remove talc (which never bothered me, btw) but WHY change the color and/or put so much shimmer that it takes WAY more to even show up on my face?
I need another blush. * I had the old formula in Orgasm and didn't like it; too dry. This new one is almost creamy and has much more pigment. I bought the shade Rush, which is perfect with my tan, a sort of cross between blush and bronzer. Overpriced so I can't give it a 5. * The new formula is talc free, but not nearly as pigmented. The swatch of Orgasm is super disappointing. Shimmery but extremely sheer. Orgasm X is now closer to the old original Orgasm. I'm so sad because I am almost out of Orgasm. I don't think I will be repurchasing. * This is a good product just not pigmented. Good shade range. * Recently bought a new Orgasm blush as like my umpteenth replacement and am so unhappy with what the new formulation has done to this blush I've used for like 20 years.  It seems to have lost most of the color and is just now a rather poor gold powder with a chalky pink cast over it. And it doesn't pick up well onto the brush or even the finger for that matter. Really bad. So sad to have lost my favorite standby. Attached a photo of the last sample size I have of apparently the old formula/color, and what i just received and will return and hunt for a new favorite blush for my medium olive skin. * So happy NARS is now Talc Free! Use to wear years ago but had to stop since I was allergic! Found another blush that I wore for years and now that's being discontinued and I had to find another new blush.. I am low girl when it comes to makeup and I got the color behave and it's beautiful and suits my skin tone…. * I was looking for the perfect cool pink blush for my very fair complected face and I found it! Although the shade is very intimidating to look at being that it is a very bright pink (I visited an ULTA to swatch before purchasing), it is absolutely stunning on the skin! Yes, there are so many other options out there but NARS knows blush like no other IMO. 🏆 This blush applies very smoothly, it is not chalky, and gives a beautiful pink finish over my bronzer. This shade is STUNNING……🤩🩷👏🏻"

The bronzer is thankfully not too dark for me and blends nicely. I'm not a fan of the highlighter color, though. It's way too bronzed. I have the ABH highlighter palette so I just use that, but I was trying to find an all-in-one face palette. I likely won't repurchase, but it is an ok palette if you like all the colors. * I love this palette. I have pale skin, so I bought Italian summer. Great pigments and great packaging. * You need this it's truly REMARKABLE ITS SO NICE MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR COLOR THOU.This will get you many to ask what you're wearing and where you get it.  The inside and out it's truly worth all the coins. I just hope it last so I'm able to get a medium one too. This is my go to and will be for a long time. Loving this. * The blush and bronzer are pretty, but the highlight is so powdery, it has not shine at all. Thinking about returning. * It's beyond a different shade in person then here. Beyond disappointed since most store aren't taking exchanges :( * This isn't horrible but it definitely isn't great. And definitely not worth the hefty price tag. The blush has almost no pigment, the bronzer has TOO MUCH PIGMENT, and the highlighter is sooo chalky and has no sheen to it at all. 

I'll use it because I already have it, but will not purchase again. * I've used several other ABH contours, blushes, and eyeshadow palettes. While the package is appealing and really cute, I couldn't justify keeping it. I have fair skin w/pink undertones and the contour looked muddy, no matter how little product or brush I used. The blush is not pigmented in the least and I had to use several layers to make it show up. Not really sure what's going on at ABH, but I'd really appreciate if they went back to the same creative process/materials used to Soft Glam and Eyebrow Wiz"

This blush is FAR better for my coloring and for applying. * I like it but, I don't use it evry day and in 2 months the applicator sponge came off .... no longer useful. * This is great if youre in a pinch and need something. But you're definitely getting what you paid for. Youre almost better off with elf or paying full price of tarte. * Beautiful color. Doesn't enhance textured skin. Works perfectly over foundation and under powder. Applicator is genius and the price point is amazing! * I got the color Darling (bright red coral) and it blends seamlessly with a beauty blender/other sponge for a natural flushed look. The bottle comes with a mixing bead that agitates the product when you shake it so you do not have to worry about separation which occurs in these liquid products. I'd actually buy more of these if I didn't have too much blush already. Highly recommend to anyone who likes liquid blushes. * Y'all I LOVE this product. I'm very much in a flirty, light makeup era and this blush is the perfect product for me right now. It's super light and blendable (think Glossier cloud paint), but also builds in a really nice way. My go to look lately is a dab of this on the cheeks and a swipe of mascara and I'm off to the races! The perfect soft blendable liquid blush, I highly recommend! * It burned my skin and made me breakout  ouch It hut so much"

After purchasing this during one of the sales, I'll never go back. I have both Candy Clouds and Golden Hour. It is quite pigmented so a little will go a long way. The blush blends seamlessly and I will keep it in my make up collection. I highly recommend! * I have 2 of these and I live them. Super cute packaging, nice scent (chocolatey), blurring, and gorgeous shades. Candy clouds is my favorite shade and blush ever * Love everything I purchased * okay so i like this blush because the color is cute, its more of a natural finish and the packiging is just mwah but it is so hard to open (the bronzers are the same packigining but easy to open) and it has a not bad but not pleasent very strong smell to it.

P.S. the smell might be different from person to person because it didnt smell bad to me it was just very strong but my friend said she hated the smell of it and it was too strong. * i loved it!! * You just need a little bit of thos blush, it lasts all day long, blends really well & smells great.

I pair it with Rare Beauty 'Hope' liquid blush or wear it on its own.  I love that it has three shades to create a custom look on my cheeks, but when I need to move fast, I use all of them all at once for a pretty soft glow blush.  I view its small size as a complete bonus.  It's absolutely perfect. * I love this color! I had been wearing the color mocha from Chanel for years and years and out of nowhere they discontinued it and nobody knew why because it was such a unique color then I switched to our oasis also discontinued so I found this and I feel like it's very similar I'm just wondering if it's going to stay on and where as well as the other two did! I really hope this doesn't get discontinued. I'm gonna buy a few more and I wish it came in a larger size. I do not feel like the her eyeshadows wewr well even w primer so im crossing my fingers that the blush stays on better! * As a ND collector this one was a miss for me, although the mini pallet in this series was great. This pulled really orange on my fair cool pink undertone. I also found the size of it impractical for having 2 blushes and a highlighter in it. I knew it was mini and that wasn't the issue, I just think it could/should have been JUST blush and it would have been great. But that highlight mixed in wasn't it for me. * I was hoping for a cool toned blush, but this ended up being more of a soft warm clay color on me than the more pinky mauve it appears to be. It wasn't working for me. The highlighter was cute, but I didn't think that or the blush had the best staying power considering the price. They aren't that bad, but just not my style, so I returned this item. The mini eyeshadow palette is a keeper, though! * If you want a pretty blush with a sheen, this is a good option. Just be aware, if you want that pinker tone (esp for us paler types) this isn't that. It's more of a rusty red tone, with a light gold highlight. * very beautiful colors and both blush and highlighter have smooth application. my new favorite!"

Blendable and buildable. They dont have a SPF smell. Do I  think everyone is going to like it, no. If you are looking for a puncy blush, this isnt it. Other than that they are beautiful colors and sit nice on the skin. * I bought the shade strawberry sunburst, and it's a really pretty coraly-red shade. I have fair to light skin, so a little of this goes a long way. I've tried it on bare skin as well as with tinted moisturizer, and it is beautiful both ways. I love that it has extra sun protection.

It was also quite patchy. Sad bc i really like physian formula * Surprising buildable coverage and the shades aren't as deep as I thought they would be. I definitely do NOT recommend this for anyone with medium + skin, as the bronzers wouldn't work, so it wouldn't be an effective use of money :/. Otherwise, it's gorgeous and I'm really excited to use it. * Im obsessed.  Love this product, buildable but also pigmented.

Love that I only have to reach for one thing to do multiple face steps. Highly recommend. * Eh. So, if you don't own a lot of makeup, I would recommend this palette. It offers a decent selection of products. It also smells amazing and is somewhat pigmented. If you already have a decent makeup collection, I would say pass * the protects make my skin be glow and felt soft love the bronzer really beautiful and glowy and the blush is a beautiful pink the  highlighter is perfect for the summer * I'm kind of disappointed. For some reason the Butter Believe It Blush and Butter Believe It Powder in the palette I received is weirdly dense and cannot be used with a brush because the bristles won't pick up any pigment whatsoever. I had no issue with the Murumuru powders though, but if I had known that two of the other powders were unusable I would have just re-purchased the All Star Palette instead."

I purchased Paris, Sydney and Palm Springs. I ended up returning Paris and kept Sydney and Palm Springs. They're very pigmented, easy to apply and the amount is controlled with a brush although fingers work just as well. The finish is a powdery matte and does not make foundation budge when applied. I will be repurchasing these when I run out. They're small and compact enough to bring anywhere! * I generally use a medium foundation and when i am tanner during the summer i end up in medium-tan or maybe a tan shade if i have the luxury of being out and about more than usual. Currently i am in medium and the Los Angeles color has this white cast, like putting flour on my face with the pink. Not my favorite. It does go on smooth. I will give the product that much. * Absolutely LOVE this blush stick. The color is pigmented without being overpowering, and it lasts well throughout the day. It sets quickly, so make sure you're ready to blend as soon as you apply * I love this product! The color Sydney is perfect. I'm light fair skin and blonde. Don't let the darker color scare you. * So glad I tried this beautiful blush. * I bought this for a good deal and I LOVE IT! I've never had a very good blush but this works perfect!

Honestly, the two colors are the same shade and depth, the only difference is that cotton candy has shimmer while barely rose is matte.  They are both beautiful - So far I have only tried cotton candy on my cheeks, wow it had way more punch than I expected! That being said I also tried it over top of the Mist cream blush, which I really didn't need to do, however it gave my cheeks a beautiful glow but I did had to buff it out a bit with a clean face brush as I was on blush overload lol.  I wish there were more shade options, it seems like many are neutral soft pinks and jump to more intense deep shades, perhaps a medium mauve/berry tone would be awesome! * It is actually cool toned, which is nice.  It's a very subtle, buildable formula but it looked very natural. It wore well for the whole day. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another color if I saw one I liked. * I purchased this during the sale.  I'd heard good things about the brand and was looking forward to trying it.  The first one I received was not the color I ordered.  Before I realized that, I tried it on and loved the formula, but it didn't show up on my fair skin.  So I went to my local Ulta to exchange it and they told me they couldn't because it was an online only item.  So I went home and called Ulta and the very nice gentleman quickly sent a new one in the right color.  In the meantime, he sent me a label to send the wrong one back.  I went to print it out and my brand new printer won't print it so I have to figure that out to get it back to them.  I have now received the new one in the right color.  I opened it to try it and I must have tipped it as I was holding it as the entire pan of powder fell out into my sink and broke apart.  As I tried to pick the pieces up, it broke into more pieces.  I've put what I could back into the pan and pushed it together, but as you can imagine, it's a mess.  I was so upset I didn't even try to put any on.  I don't even know if I'll be able to make it work.  Wish I could tell you more, but as you can tell, it's not been a positive experience. * I purchased this during the sale and I'm so surprised this was the last one to sell out or didn't sell out at all! This is the shade I planned to get before the sale started and I thought it would sell out quickly because of the pink blush trend. The photos do not do this blush justice! This is a neutral almost dusty pink that looks so glossy and shiny on the cheeks, without visible glitter or sparkles, at least to my eye. I've seen other reviews stating that there is glitter, but I don't see it. It just looks like your cheeks are glowing. 
It's such a gorgeous shade and finish for spring and summer. When I opened the compact, I gasped at how pretty this is and I never do that. * These are just beautiful if you are pale complexion they are great but i think they will work for dark complexion also everything is heat about these blushes. * I was actually surprised as I wanted another shade but ""Cotton candy"" was all they had left on sale. I purchased it and wow, it's stunning. I wish it didn't have the slight glitter, but it leaves a beautiful ethereal glow. Great quality compact too. Gorgeous! * For the price I'm very disappointed at the size of the blush.  The compact is small, and internal blush circle even smaller.   A normal size blush brush will need to be swirled multiple times to get coverage.  Color is pretty, but this is a standard blush…no different in performance than a drug store blush."

The colors don't apply evenly and there is way too much glitter in the blush and highlighter. I returned it and will continue to scrape the pans of my old palette until i find a suitable replacement. * The blush is show stopping. I get stopped all the time when i wear it. So confused why the reviews are bad bc this palette is gorgeous. the highlighter is pretty, and the bronzer is quite pigmented. Nothing too special- the blush is def a game changer tho. * I really wanted a cheek palette to cut down on clutter in my makeup bag. I was sorely disappointed to learn this wasn't it. The highlighter is just glitter. Way too coarse of a glitter than I prefer for a highlight. It looks nice as a shadow. The blush is more of a highlight, it's very iridescent. I learned that I prefer matte blush after using this. The bronzer warmed up my light complexion nicely but it does not make a good contour color; I use it more for a sun kissed glow. There is a lot of fall out from this palette.  It is usable but not as I intended it. * This is so easy to use and looks absolutely stunning on. Make sure to use the tarte brush with it for application. It blends it well. I have worn on top of foundation and on a clean face, works both ways!"

The slightly larger blush, highlight and bronzer are good quality and fairly pigmented as well. * I've tried a couple of milani products and liked them, good quality for the price point. This is a very nice palette and feel the name suits it, i think this would look great on a variety of skin tones. It's very pigmented! I wasn't expecting that.

When I do my makeup, i sometimes have to wipe down my vanity because of all the fallout * i use this palette every day, and use the complexion products most often just because i dont usually wear rosy eyeshadow, although the colors are gorgeous and the pigment is really nice. i especially love the highlight shade and the shimmery blush, i love a glowy look and it really achieves that. the highlight is also a really pretty light champagne/gold color. the only thing i could critique is the fact the bronzer shade is pretty warm and you need to use a light hand if youre a lighter complexion (im light/medium) but i still do really like it and use it regularly. milani is ome brand i will always trust with complexion products, i haven't been disappointed yet. * This palette has it all!

I had never dropped it would treated it roughly. I think its just not pressed hard enough. The sales associate said they had already had a few returned for the same reason ☹️☹️☹️ * Love this item- very versatile, has staying power, and a hint if shimmer. * I bought it in place of the bare minerals bronzer because they were out. It's not even close to the same. With this one a little goes a long way and it's too orange for my skin. * not a great powder and has a weird smell * The CEO Deepica is begging people on IG to leave comments here so that's probably where all the good reviews are coming from.

I'm tired of always having my shade range available online only. Beautiful palette, bold colors, and deep enough for the darkest skin tones.

It's cheaply made and should be sold as makeup for little girls to play in. Not impressed at all. Will be returning it . * The colors are perfect and exactly what I wanted, a warm yellow tan but the problems are the lip gloss tastes terrible like perfume and the eyeshadow irritated my eyes as soon as I put it on. I'm pretty sure a lot of that was because of the glitter fall out. I do have sensitive eyes so who knows. The gloss smells nice but doesn't taste nice unfortunately. There's pretty much no color which could be overlooked if it tasted better and was moisturizing. The blush is pretty sheer which I prefer a buildable blush so that's ok and the highlight is sheer with no color to it which is also ok because it looks more natural. All in all I would not repurchase this and have no desire to try other colors. * I've bought around 3 of these because I truly love the product in itself. It's convenient, pretty, and easy to use especially when it's a quick day or I'm travelling with it. the only big downside from me that's disappointing is the top glitter keeps breaking and falling out, in which glitter then gets everywhere. It's again a nice product besides that and it's making me hesitant to buy again as I'd like to not have to clean up a glitter mess for once * I've wanted to try this ever since it came out, and finally had a chance to pick one up in the Fresh Peach shade. This is such a lovely product. My favorite is suprisingly the lip balm, its so hydrating with a nice wash of color, and lasts super long, even with drinking. I was a bit sad that the blush is a powder, not cream, but its still beautiful. 

The only negative is I wish the eyeshadow shade was a bit less full glitter, and more of a shimmer. Its hard to use solely on the eyes due to that, and otherwise this stack would make a perfect all in one travel product. It works great on top of eyeshadow sticks though! * perfect for traveling!!  I got the oh so nudie palette. eyeshadow is very glittery, the cheek is more a subtle matte, the lip gloss is creamy pigmented & very smooth! & the highlight is more a creamy clear balm. ( subtle glitter but not a lot.) * Easy and convenient product but the glitter made a mess. Eye glitter cracked and thr thing to close the lid opened and now my bag and all my products are covered in glitter. Do not recommed! * I got the pink one and it is worth it for the beautiful cream highlighter.  Not 5 stars b/c the lip color has absolutely zero pigment."

I try adding more product to the area that looks patchy and it adds color around it making it super pigmented except for that problem area. Its a pretty color but that's about it. I don't like the consistency. * I would buy this product again, but in different colors. * I was shocked at how pigmented this product was. Two dots on each cheek was almost too much product!

Im no stranger to cream products, however. I trally, really like these! The colors look great on my skin tone, which is somewhere around ""medium"". I find the best way to apply these products is by rubbing a makeup brush right over the top of the product, rather than applying directly to my face. The colors and finish is so pretty. Its natural looking, yet not so much that it just blends away. Seems to last a relatively long time, as well. I will definitely be purchasing more from this brand. * Love these easy to blend colors! On our vacation, these made getting ready super easy. The colors are really pretty too. Will buy again! * Color applies smoothly however the color tube is sliding off the tube, it can break so I have to be careful when I open each tube and apply it. * Light color and glossy * I use these daily for a no makeup look with a tinted moisturizer.

Definitely going to pick up more shades and I definitely recommend to anyone. * I am an avid cream blush user and have tried many different brands. I decided to give this a try after hearing a lot of good things about them, but I unfortunately did not like it. The longetivity isn't the best, even for being matte - the minute you rub your face it's gone (even when I set with powder blush on top). It's unfortunate because I loved the natural color it gives and that it's buildable, but I can't justify the price for the lack of lasting power. Maybe if you like to wear very light makeup and don't care for your blush not lasting long would I get this (even then there's better for less $$$, such as the elf putty blush) * I bought this during the 21 Day promotion.  I wanted to try but a bit pricey but on sale i will try.  I was skeptical but I will say I love this product.  Im older with typical challenges we older girls face.  This product goes on smooth. Blemds beautifully and lasts all day.  I love it.  Really great product. * I was so excited go try this when i saw influencers using it so i immediately purchased during the 50% off sale. The packaging and brush tip is cute but its almost impossible to get the blush to blend out and i feel like it could easily mess with whatever makeup you have on underneath. The mirror also came cracked. Other blushes are cheaper and more blendable with better color pay off, i returned and bought a rare beauty blush instead and i'm much happier * A must-have in your beauty arsenal. The color pay-off is intense so you don't need to use a lot. It does what you want. A hint of summer color? Then, use a little and keep it sheer. If you prefer a more opaque sweep of color, then use more. Nudestix and Tower 28 are my fav blushes. Bye-bye powders."

The powder is nice and velvety and had no issues hard-panning (like some pricey ones like the Amazonian clay and orgasm-brand line's blushes).  Also, it's nice to find a cool-toned blush selection for my cool-toned skin.

HOWEVER, because it's so soft, a brush ends up kicking up a lot of product and could deposit a lot of product onto the brush.  However, applying with fingers makes the blush melt into the skin like a dream. * Product too pigmented for my look."

I'm running out and didn't want to spend the money for another so, I came across Cheek Freak Blush Balm in the color Score. Better price point for me right now. When I opened the case, I was a little concerned about the color but, once on and built up a little (I'm more tan than normal right now because of summer) it was the exact color. I love that it is cream (I have aging skin) and it blends really well. I used my fingers to apply and blend. I would recommend and I will be trying additional products. * I love this blush. I'm a makeup newbie and I found this very buildable and easy to use, while still pigmented enough that you don't need much product. The cream to powder formula sits nicely on the skin and lasts me 8+ hours even without setting spray or powders on top. * Awesome blush! Natural or can be easily built on for a more dramatic look! Does great especially for the price! * Buildable and blendable! Love this clean blush! Long lasting, great pigment that doesnt look overdone! * i got the shade smash, and i absolutely love it. it can be subtle but its also easy to build if you want an intense look. i also like this product because i have sensory issues and cant stand powder , but oily skin so cream just slips right off. this is a good in between. feels like a cream but finishs like a very soft very fine powder. idk how to explain it but i love it. also, the shade is gorgus. tip: to find the perfect natural shade for you, squeeze the tip of ur finger and try to match that shade. * Picked ""Shagged"" and it's way more pink/neon on me than I wanted. I really didn't care for it and would have returned it had I not destroyed the box it came in. 

Still, i like the texture and how well it blends. Wish there was a wider range of shades. * Doesn't blend well with other makeup and leaves patches and streak marks. I really wanted to love this product but each use just leaves me disappointed."

These are a very thin, creamy, glowy sheer blushes that make highlighter unnecessary. No detectable glitter just the most beautiful sheen that brings your cheeks back to life! This formula does not dry down however, they do become less sticky but doesn't dry down completely.  Therefore, I would not consider these long wearing but that isn't in the claims either. As someone with dry skin, these are stunning and everything I want, and doesn't emphasize texture. I heard these are a dupe for the makeup by Mario plumping cheek blushes and I can totally see that being the case but I do not own those. * Such a creamy blush with good pigment. It is now one of my staple blushes. Good for those who like to look glowy. Last me all day * I have fair, mature skin. I purchased Garden Party. I applied after foundation and powder. I love the color, although it did pull a little more peachy on me. Applies more sheer but is easily buildable. And the sheen it gives is beautiful. Not shimmery, just glowing. The finish reminds of the Makeup by Mario soft pop plumping blush veil. Love this blush, highly recommend!! * I bought multiple shades of this blush while it was on sale and the colors are so beautiful! The darker shades seem scary but I'm telling you they blend so well and give the look of 'old money'. I have very fair cool toned skin and have tried so many other brands of blush. This is the most user friendly, not too glowy formula I've tried. Powder sits well on top. Worth the try! * Very pretty and very pigmented. * I got the Flamingo color and it is AMAZING on my cheeks. You can put on a little or a lot. Like a natural flush. * Great blush"

Its easy to use; you can use your fingers or a sponge to buff it out, but I prefer using a brush. While it seems to set down and dry, it does wear away easily. But i actually dont mind that since i dont use blush anyway. * It blends so amazing not as good as rare beauty and the others but it does its job if you are on a budget. * Loved the sheer natural wash of color. Adds lightweight brightening sheen, not cakey or dull. Inexpensive too. * very good and easy blend blush. nice and soft pink color * Very pretty blush, it applies so smooth and is a great product for super cheap! The color is gorgeous as well. * I've tried to use this product multiple times on my cheeks, because I felt the color was so pretty. I couldn't get the color to look anything except patchy, very disappointing. I wear dewey makeup, so maybe it would work for those who wear matte?

It's mattee too which I like because I prefer the sparkle & shine to come from my highlighter. If you wanna go a little more bold, Red Riot is also stunning. It's a really great product, that doesn't cost very much & lasts a long time. Seriously, what more do you guys want from a blush? * perfect blendable and buildable bold blush * When I got home I noticed it was broken and it was a mess. * I wanted to love this blush but it's just not giving me the pigmentation I thought it would.

The price point is decent. I'd say this is a milk dupe but I think undone came out with this first! * OMG I love this blush! It's so buildable and it feels cool on your skin. It's a natural flush that you can keep subtle or really make it pop. * its like the tarte blush sticks but way better. they actually dry down and don't leave a greasy feel at all. ive had so many compliments its unreal. definitely more pigmented than a lot of other blush sticks/stains (looking at you benetint). excellent price for a great product * Blush is my favorite makeup product. I bought this based on the reviews and am glad I did. It's soooo beautiful and gives a natural flush of color when applied with a brush. It blends out nicely along with a soothing cooling effect. I purchased Peach which is a pretty reddish pink color on my medium deep neutral undertone. * This water blush stick is a dupe for the new Milk jelly tint FOR SURE. I got the shade Cherry because I'm trying the whole red blush thing and I tried it on the second I got home from Ulta. It's really easy to apply, just use a light hand (you can always add more!) and then use your fingers or a brush to blend out. It's provides a beautiful, natural flush of color that really lasts. I've enjoyed every product I've tried from Undone. I can't believe this hasn't sold out! * I wanted a clean ingredient lip tint so I decided to give this one a try. It's so amazing, I cannot go a day without it. It's very natural looking, or you can build it up to be a little bit darker. It blends easily and is not drying in the slightest (actually keeps my lips pretty soft!). It's small and travels well but lasts FOREVER. I used it as blush once and it looked very natural. Washes off easily if you mess up and us super easy to reapply. I feel naked without it! I can't wait to try other colors."

I have used this as a regular blush, which gives a soft glow all over the cheeks and as as highlighter over different blush. if using as a highlighter, it does have a pink under tone, so I had to blend it a little with the blush I did use and it looked so good still! this was my first iconic London item I've ever tried, and I'm now obsessed and am going to have to try more products from them! * Love how it looks on my skin. * Easy to blend and a good shade that works well on medium skintones without feeling heavy or overly saturated * Love the tanny glow on my fair skin.

No matter if it was on bare skin or with skin tint * Loved it but you just need so much product ao not worth the cost * No 5 star due to application.  Too much always comes out. * Love the flexibility of cream blush. I prefer a subtle tone, so a little of this works perfectly. Melts into my skin and looks natural. NOTE: I bought Provence shade, not Mistral. * Got the blush in the color Provence and it's a beautiful soft nude pink shade. I was eyeing this blush for months but when I couldn't find a similar liquid blush shade to this, I decided to bite the bullet and get it despite reading mixed reviews about this formula. I tried so hard to make this work since the shade is everything I was looking for but it was patchy, splotchy, and hard to blend out. I tried it with a brush, sponge, and my fingers but once it made contact with the skin, it was hard to blend out. The only way I got it to work was if I mixed the blush with another medium like liquid foundation. I held onto it for a few weeks but it wasn't worth the hassle so I returned it unfortunately. * I got a sample of Provence as a GWP and when i first opened it i thought the color definitely would not work on my medium neutral asian skin. It appeared pale and at first i couldnt really see it on my skin so i applied a second layer which was VERY PATCHY just ribbing with my finger tips. I let it dry for a moment and moved the product around again on my bare skin with my fingertips and it gave a beautiful natural flush with a dewiness that looked like my natural skin! It wore well over hours. I was surpised i liked such a light pink and how the formula melted into my skin. Not sure how this will work over makeup, perhaps over a skin tint would be okay but for natural days with just sunscreen on this is nice but the patchiness makes it so the product takes longer to apply well. I think the trick is to wait for it to dry down before blending. * I received a sample of this blush in the color Provence in an Ulta sample bag. 

The formula for this dries way too quickly. This causes a streaky application because you don't have time to blend it before it dries. Plus the muddiness of the shade just makes my face look dirty. Maybe the color would make a decent contour, but with the streakiness i doubt it would work out."

I sae these for such a good price and i got them. I love them they blend so nice and creamy. Its a perfect size too so they dont dry out and i can use them fully. * You can easily build up the products depending on what kind of look you're going for, and they blend so smoothly onto skin with fingertips or a sponge! I use this after prepping skin with DIME tinted sunscreen. The highlight blends best with fingertips as it is a little dark, so warm fingers disperse the glow a little better! This is a wonderful set for someone getting into more natural & simple glowwy makeup :) * I ordered this little kit for my daughter actually. She is a toddler in her first year of dance and it is recommended they have sole makeup for recital. I was looking for something natural and light that I would feel comfortable putting on her little face and that I could apply with minimal mess if she can't sit still. When this arrived we tried it out immediately and it is absolutely perfect! The texture is nice, the color is lovely, and it stayed on while she was playing and being wild. I have no doubts it will stay put and look lovely for her recitals. She did fight me a little bit in the test run but she was more receptive of this than the hair brush so I'd say it's not too bad if you have a toddler ballerina too. I was so pleased with the packaging and quality and just everything that I'm looking at the Nudestix items I might want for my makeup bag since I rarely do my makeup anymore since having my kiddo. I would definitely recommend. * This product I bought on a whim due to having a baby and not having the time to do a full face of makeup and feel good when I leave the house. I'm able to glide it on so fast and it blends so easily. I'm so in love with this product and how beautiful I feel when I pass by a mirror and check myself out!

This is going back. * I have had this product in my wishlist forever but was scared to try a brand im not familiar with but am now so glad i gave it a shot! I purchased georgia and bubble and the colors look exactly as advertised online and are very buttery, pigmented and apply effortlessly.

You can't beat this gel blush for staying power and a natural look. * I just started using this blush and love it. It has a sheer and natural color to it and feels very moisturizing.

I love the ascetic of this product. if I had to mention a con I'd say it's a bit bulky if you were to store this in a small cosmetic bag, but who wants to store this away! this makeup deserves to be displayed on a counter or shelf. it's so beautiful 😍 * It's not that good. you really need alot to work it in and it stick to one spot sometimes when applied. * In Tea Rose, this is the perfect blush. It goes on well w a blender, I pat this product on, not smear. The color is natural and it goes on like a charm. I will try other blushes, but they are too wet or the wrong color, so I keep coming back. I'm in my fifties and this one is the best creme blush I've ever tried, hands down. * Being a ""woman of a certain age"", I have struggled to find a cream blush in a matte finish. This one is labeled ""satin"" and the color is a very nice rose pink that does not turn orange on my skin. It is a sheer tint, but it will layer and blend for more intense color. The price is reasonable, but the packaging is bulky and a little difficult to open. The reason I did not give five stars is the dryer feel of this product. I'm sure this was necessary so it would hold the rose shape in the container. I would have been happier with a regular flat presentation and a softer, creamier feel. I will try a few things with application because I do love the color."

Also not brown and black friendly in the slightest due to the drop of pigment added. I have a medium olive tone and I used the most vibrant shade, it  did not show up. Don't waste your money, Get Pixi for that price! * Its not pigment the most but its creamy and really blendable. I really like it * Its such a cute blush with good pigment and even some shimmer so it also serves as highlighter. But it doesnt last that long and you'll probably have to reapply * if you've seen the pixi on-the-glow blushes and have been considering buying them, DON'T. buy these instead. not only are they cheaper, but they're better quality. there's also more shade ranges for this product. i have 3 shades: blackberry crush, citrus crush, and raspberry crush. all of them are so beautiful especially in the summer. they are super easy to apply and blend as well as being long lasting through the entire day. i will say that i use this multi-stick more often as a blush, but that's because i have so many different lip products to use. drew barrymore really slayed with this one. * I was so sad this didnt work. I used Strawberry on top of the Colourpop pretty fresh foundation and it didnt show up at all. For reference, I'm between 10-30 fair neutral in that foundation. Im pale! It seemed more like a gloss woth a HINT of a color. I was so excited for this and it failed in my eyes. :( * This is my absolute favorite! It's got a glow to it, not as in mica but just a dewy glow that looks so ethereal. So easy to blend and it gives you a lot of control over the amount. I don't like blushes normally because either I over apply it or it disappears, this lasts a long time and doesn't look harsh. I'm very pale and the peach color looks like a natural blush!

I wouldn't exactly say this makes you look ""dewy"" but it works great on direct skin or skin with foundation. They are buildable and blend well. For me they last most of the day too. Small and compact too which is great for touch ups if need be. I think I'll buy the full size and keep these as my travel buddies."

They're just like powder stamped strawberries and the moment you swipe with your brush, they will come off. The color is very pretty but it doesnt last on the skin. I could barely tell at the end of the day that i had any blush on. The formula itself seemed a bit chalky and it took a couple swipes to get the blush to build up. It smells like fresh strawberries, but what good is for the product to smell good if it doesn't perform as it should? Too bad i threw away the box it came in, or i would return it. Not worth the price tag in my opinion. * The scent is too sweet for me, but the color is nice and the texture of it is too. * the scent is very sweet and it leaves a nice pink on your cheeks as well * The smell is absolutely addicting lol. The strawberries sadly do not stay past the first layer but it still gives a pretty color on the cheeks. It lasts a fine amount of time * My friend got me this for christmas and im so happy she did, i love this blush. Its the cutest shade and smells like strawberries. Yummy yum. I reccomend! * Yes the strawberries wipe away instantly but it's still a very pretty color and it smells good * Strawberries wipe off after one swipe with a finger or brush, and the color of so sheer its not even there."

It was easy to apply with a beauty blender. But it messed my foundation underneath a little bit. It kind of took off my foundation and then disappeared! So after a few hours both the blush and my foundation were faded. I have also tried the shade Rose Romance, which is a deeper pink that stays longer but it still faded my foundation * I got the Pink Flirt. The color turned out to be not really pink but almost kind of orange...very not attractive. I thought it also went on kind of heavy and not translucent.  Had to return. * If you prefer natural no base products (foundation,  concealer, etc.) then this is perfect for you! However, if you do use base products beware this will remove the coverage wherever you apply it. If you have acne on your cheekbones (like me) this will reveal the discoloration underneath. I add powder blush on top and it seems to help but not a definite solution to the problem. * I love Milani products; unfortunately, the pink flirt shade was disappointing. It was definitely more peach/orange in color. If the color was right, I would've loved it! * So easy to use!!"

Probably one if my all time favorites as it works so well with my skin tone. Will buy again over and over! * The cream textures are really unique and superb formulas. The blush blends like a dream and the highlighter is unbelievable. It blends so easily with just a few taps from my finger. I cannot say enough about these two. Love. The powder highlighter is pretty and I do like it, but when you pair it with the two creams, it really isn't anything special. I wish it had been another cream. Another highlighter color or blush color in the cream formula would have been amazing. That's why I have 4 stars and not 5. Still fully worth the price tag for the two products though. * I'm not sure why the reviews are so great for this pallette. first of all, it arrived broken and second I'm pretty fair to medium skin and I have to put several coats of this on and it's hardly noticeable. In my opinion, definitely not worth the price. Highly disappointed. * I love this palette! The blush is agreat color and the cream highlighter is my favorite highlighter of all time. I use the powder highlighter as more of a highlight eyeshadow. I only wish the blush was a cream formula like the middle highlighter. * This texture is stunning. These formulas glide beautifully, no streakiness, perfect tones, and the texture is stunning. Believe the hype. Natasha's makeup is QUALITY. Worth every dime! * The interplay between color and texture in this palette is genius. I cant remember yhr kast time i felt so oretty, as i did when i wore this.

I love how pigmented it is too * I would not call the light colors baby pink or peach. They don't blend out well so I can't fix it by blending out a tiny bit. * I bought this to go along with the contour stick . I am normally not a cream product person but this has easily turned into one of my favorite products .

It's so easy to use and it's fun to "" draw "" on your face ha.

I have to say this shade is so beautiful and absolutely perfect for fall. It is sheer at first but you can build it up for the right amount of color. I cannot comment on how it fares as a lip tint yet but even if you only use it as a blush I think it is worth the buy. * The lip stain lasts minimal 3 hours and the tone is perfect! * I got the shade Blush.

Unfortunately my face didn't love this product. I have reactive skin and this product flared up my rosacea very badly so unfortunately I have to return. I know their products are vegan and supposed to be gentle, but this just didn't work for me. * As a newer purchase, i wanted to make sure to try this thoroughly before reviewing. I have two shades. Both perform the same. I find that i have to blend quickly with my fingers or a wet sponge to avoid patchiness but the finish is SO worth it.

The only thing I dislike is I heard Kiko Milano doesn't keep products around. * Pigment is gorgeous and package is just beautiful and the colors are so beautiful...but why all the shine? Give me some matte or satin finish then I'll repurchase. * I was excited to receive this blush because the color seemed beautiful ""golden coral"" but it doesn't have that much details on the product and when I received it it looked like a super shimmery highlighter. Not what I wanted, it would've been so beautiful without the glitter/shimmer * I am 42 and I can't wear makeup the same as when I was younger. A virtual aid said my color is coral and this shadow is perfect. I can use a little or a lot and it doesn't look clownish. It is very light and silky smooth. * The color of this Coral Rose blush is exactly as it's pictured on the Ulta app. It's pretty bright but the powder is firmly packed in the pan so it's easy to lightly pick some up on the brush and build the color up.

Would totally recommend! * Bought this a few months ago expecting color...I was sorely mistaken. After I tried it I applied more because even though I extremely fair toned it did not show up at all and disappeared. I'm disappointed to say the least. * I like the versatility of this. * To be quite honest, I'm not sure what other reviews are talking about when they say this product has hardly any pigment because it is EXTREMELY pigmented. A little bit goes a very long way, I can use a pin head sized amount my entire cheek and then some. It's super easy to blend out, and while it is pigmented, it's also easy to build up. Perhaps lighter shades might be more difficult to work with (I used the shade Fuschia Passion) but I love this blush. Doesn't have a super dewy finish, but adds a nice flushed glow to a dewy look. * This cheek tint is super cute, and I love the dewy look it leaves on my face for a more natural appearance. It blends well, it gives nice color, and is gorgeous really. It's lightweight and perfect for a gently flushed look. The product could easily be buildable for more color too, depending on what you're going for. The only reason why I didn't give this five stars is because there's barely any product in the tube! I've used this maybe about 5 times and I already have to squeeze to get more product out. Good thing it's affordable but they should actually fill the tube to fit the size.

The TLDR of this is that I enjoy the bronzer and two blushes, but hate the highlighter.

The blushes and bronzer are all matte formulas, and then the highlighter is the Super Shock putty-cream like formula. Personally, I never liked the Super Shock formula because I prefer using brushes when doing my makeup, and none of my brushes can pick up this formula, leaving me to do it with my fingers. Okay, whatever. I can get over that. But the biggest problem that I have with this highlighter is that it is mostly GLITTER. I love a glitter highlighter now and then, but not when using an everyday palette for an everyday look. It looks so weird to have matte bronzer and blush, and then a stripe of glitter on my cheekbones. It would be fine if the highlighter was a cute shimmery color, like Lunch Money, but it's very glittery which sucks. Tbh, I bought a cheap Essence highlighter so that I could crush up the ColourPop one and transfer the Essence one into the compact so that I can actually have an all in one palette. Oh well.

However, the packaging is a bit of a miss too. Aesthetically, it looks great, but mine no longer clasps shut even though I haven't done anything like drop it. So it's probably not a great option for traveling anymore, which was why I wanted it… lol * One of my go to palletes, especially for the blush!! I like to mix the bottom two. The pigment is just right and very buildable. Could be used for natural or full glam :) * I first purchased for the blush but ended up using all four! I love this and it's a great all in one palette! * Love the palette. Pretty. * Blends seamlessly and amazing for travel * I gave this pallete a 3 to be generous. There are two blushes, which I like, but the blush and bronzer do not stay at all! The highlighter stays, but it's very faint on the face. My pallete at least had a problem where it wouldn't stay closed, and the pans are too small. * Love the palette ! I wish the highlighter had bigger chunks of glitter. That's all!"

No pigment on lightest shade...and I am very fair. You'd be better off with anything else. The bronzer is not bad though. * I absolutely loved the colors and they have good pigment. I was a big fan of the highligher in particular which had really good color payoff when applying with just a brush. My only issue is that it broke SO EASILY. At first the small clasp that kept the palette closed broke so it wouldn't remain closed. Then small pieces started falling out of the pans and eventually all of them fell out. If this issue was resolved I'd repurchase it * Very sad to write this not because the actual product isn't great, but you can't do anything with the product when it breaks so easily. Bought 2 and same thing happened. Once one breaks there's no fixing everything starts breaking off and it's very messy :( * I bought two different pallets of this product from Ulta. I was hoping that with the first one, it was a dud and the second one would be better. Unfortunately, with both pallets the blushes broke off and made a big mess.

To me it smells like Hawaii: flowers and sunscreen (but in a really delicious and nostalgic way, I lived in Hawaii for years). 

It blends onto my skin in such a gorgeous and flattering way, and really does feel like butter. Applies in a way that makes it seem like a more expensive blush. 

I *do not* like the brush included with the product, but that's my opinion. I prefer the feeling and appearance of application with a nicer blush or angled brush."

Definitely would recommend. (P.S. a little goes a long way) * I love this product and color. It was recommended by one of the makeup artists at the store. Lasts along time!  Just recently bought another one which was over a year ago from my first purchase.  I will admit that I don't wear makeup everyday. * I did like this product. * the BEST blush i have ever tried * So disappointed they discontinue the pink, tried the peach but it doesn't look right, * I won't be buying this product again.

I have mine in the shade poppy and it makes for the most beautiful sunburnt shade. It's pigmented, but still buildable and easy to work with. I love how dewy it looks on the skin as well. This is definitely a new fav. * I love the blush and it's consistency. I was a little scare about the liquid formula seperating my makeup but that didn't happen. It's nice for me since I love less pigmented products * I think the poor reviews on this product were expecting a dupe (even though its not marketed as one). It says ultralight snd thats whst it is, irs perfect for summer (not full glam, not on foundation). Toasty is the perfect blush/bronzer combo. * I really like this blush! you barely need to put product on your face to have a lot of pigment, so I know this thing is gonna last forever. you do need to blend kinda quickly, and I recommend using a liquid blush brush. I only wear tinted moisturizer, not foundation, so idk how it would work with that, but it does just fine with moisturizer. This is an affordable, lovely blush! * I got the shade cheeky and it has a bit more warmth than i expected for a 'blue pink', but it's a super pretty color anyways! it has the perfect medium amount of pigment and was super easy to blend out with a pretty finish. Wore well too * I bought Cheeky and its such a pretty and flattering color for me. I put the product first on the back of my hand then swipe a brush over the color and apply it then to my cheeks. I need to get more colors! * I bought the shade toasty, it's a lovely toasted caramel color. I like that the packaging is bigger than other drugstore blushes in this kind of packaging, and I really like that it has a locking mechanism and snap faceted cap. It's very easy to use.

 However, it didn't suit my skin. I have dry skin and this dries down too fast for me to blend it out, even over a hydrating primer and with the assistance of a facial mist. It leaves a stain, which is a plus, if you are able to blend it out."

She is medium toned skin with long straight dark hair. This looked lovely on her. She really liked it! * I found the pigments patchy and hard to blend. Also not really sure what skin tone this palette is for... I'm very fair and the lightest color is still way too light. I actually can use it as a highlighter. The medium two do work for me as blush but honestly on the skin they look the same. And then I though the darkest one would be pretty if I could sheer it out, but since it's so patchy I end up having to use a lot and then it's just way to dark. I think it would be better if they made different palettes for different skin tones. O, and if you're buying this for the glitter, don't. It's only on top. * This palette is stunning! Beautiful, BEAUTIFUL, shimmering colors, and very affordable! * I love glue and sparkling things. I'm crazy about this set because it has the colors I like with the touch of glitter that I love. I bought it as a gift but had to keep it for myself 🥰 * I have a fair skintone, but do tan in the summer. This highlight was exactly what I've been looking for. Beautiful color, and the sparkles are bright and glowing! I used the pink color as eyeshadow and it wasn't too pigmented, but gave a nice glow. * I noticed all the photo reviews of this product are trash and not very helpful. Even the photos of the palette from the site and website aren't too helpful for what this is. I am using the app and realize there's no option to upload a photo as well, so let me explain what you get exactly to aid your decision in purchasing this palette. 

I am happy with the four tones. They are quite different from one another. The first blush on the very left is a pink. It is metallic bright baby pink with blue glitter overspray. Yes, the actual blush is metallic. Like a highlighter. It is not just the overspray. 

The second shade from the left is a warm rose shade. It is less metallic than the pink first one and definitely has a more natural appearance. It has a gold glitter overspray. 

The 3rd shade is a peachy tone with a champagne glitter overspray. It is metallic like the rest of them. 

The last shade is the one that surprised me the most. It is a deep red shade, a burgundy in the pan. It would suit deeper skin tones for sure.  Again, it is metallic and has a gold glitter overspray. 

There's actually not that much glitter overspray as I imagined from reading other reviews. HOWEVER, The shades are metallic (some more than others), so they will give a sheen off your cheeks. The first and last shade are the most highlighter-like shades. 

I am fair-light in skin tone and I am happy with this purchase. I didn't know what I was getting. It is a good value. It would work with even much deeper skin tones due to the sheen and reflection of color that it offers. 

It is not bad. Just know what you're getting. That is shiny blushes with a little bit of glitter. Great value. 

If you want a matte finish, this is NOT for you. And these blushes can actually look natural, except for the first and last shade (too reflective). The 2nd and 3rd blushes give a healthy glow. * Looks so good online but when i picked it and got it home it was chalky and no pigment with tons of big glitter. I cant wear this at 39 years old but maybe good for girls to play ""dressup"" i don't recommend at all save your money on a better quality product."

You will not be disappointed. * A photo doesn't always portray a color accurately or how it will actually look like on your face. Looking at the photo the pallet appears soft pink. It is actually more brown on the skin and like a bronzer. Perhaps trying to make it lighter will help. * This leaves the most unflattering tone on my skin. Not universal and leaves a grey-ash cast. I don't like this AT ALL. Also leaves texture. * Love this LM highlighter I use for an everyday simple look I use my cc cream and LM Chai blush and some mascara to complement my look 🥰 * I was certain I'd love this and ordered it sight unseen. Well, ...

Pros: It has a lovely sheen, noticeable but not metallic or Ofra-y, with zero glitter.

Cons: It's not at all the pale pink you see in the picture, and I'm really not sure what the brand means by ""self-adjusting to match all skin tones."" The color is truer to the product's name; it's a definite, discernible rose. My skin is light to light-medium, not fair by any means, and there's no way this could be a highlighter on me. (Thing is, I don't think it's rich enough to work on deep skin. And it seems too cool to be right for tan skin.) Anyway, on me it's a blush/blush topper for sure.

I can't complain about the formula, and I'm sure I'll use it - but if I'd been able to swatch it first I probably wouldn't have bought it. * I had high hopes for this highlighter but was disappointed when, what I expected to be a pale neutral pink shade was actually a midtoned champagne that's too dark and warm for my very fair, cool toned skin.  

Since this isn't available at any store near me, I bought it based on the photo showing a pale pink swatch, the description of a neutral undertone and the self adjusting shade claim, none of which is accurate.  I could tell just by swatching that it wouldn't work but I applied it anyway and saw that it definitely was too dark and warm.  Since I only wore it for a few minutes, I can't speak to the formula or wear time other than to say it's pigmented with a glitter free buildable shine.  

With the level of technology available, there's no excuse for product photos to be so inaccurate, a problem that also adds to the already excessive amount of wasted makeup.  I love many Laura Mercier products but this was a fail and while I think the shade could work on light to tan skintones, it's too dark for fair and possibly too ashy on deep."

I am usually a peach girly but i have been using magic brownie for almost a year. I appreciate that the packaging is sustainable. Mine has been beat up a but after some time but it has not fallen apart or torn in anyway. * I bought Sexual Flufstration and the color and texture are gorgeous, but the packaging broke immediately. This carton situation really is not practical. You should introduce an actual compact and then sell the refills in the egg carton material. Until then, save your money and buy the lip color and use it on your cheeks too. * Bought this brown blush to try out the ""rich girl makeup"" and its a great putty cream to powder blush but I didnt realize this brand was intended to be used as a custom palette. The foam/paper compact is fragile and it broke so I cant securely close it anymore. * This packaging feels like paper meets styrophome. It breaks and falls apart whenever you try to open an use the product. I contemplated taking it out of the packaging entirely but due to its cream nsture crumbs and hair and everything else sticks to it. If you want ti buy this, try it out in person first. Very didappointing. * Purchased this beautiful Color:Only Drama-magenta plum.  Was search of a winter purple... upset over the talc ... more upset that the shade didn't last on skin.  Used with BB Face base, both elf primers, all nighter and just faded.  I'm medium beige to tan and my lil girl whom picked the color is very fair cool and it didn't last as well. Used layered as blush/eyeshadow. May return... It may work for someone else. * Purchased from Ulta.com. Always love to try new brands which is why I ordered this blush (shade: only drama - magenta plum). First, while I appreciate sustainable packaging, I had challenges opening up the lime green packaging - a piece snapped off which did not make me happy. Second, this is supposed to be a cream product (cream to powder) however it's more of a powder.  The positive is that the color is pretty but it's not enough to overcome the cons. * Bought this without checking the ingredients, thinking the brand would know better. Talc is the number one ingredient! Big mistake for the brand!"

I put it on in the morning and was out in the sun all day and it was still very present on my skin and lips when I got home several hours later. 

The stain is very easy to use on lips, but more difficult to use on cheeks. Having largely used cream blushes, it took several uses to get adapted to the lack of blend-ability for this product. I also need to find another applicator to try to use, as I usually use my fingers to blend out products and as an applicator, but this product stained them. 

I do really appreciate the high quality of both the packaging and the product itself, as well as the mission of the brand Ere Perez and this product as a whole. * I used the Beetroot Cheek and Lip tint primarily as a lip tint. WOW did it last!! Initially when applied to the lips it gives a very vibrant coral pink and red hue that is a little too overwhelming for my taste but when I wiped the lip tint off with a towel and pursed my lips together moving the lip tint around it was a beautiful shade that was perfect for summer.
A Tip- the tint is extremely long lasting (By long lasting I mean almost all day with eating and drinking), with that being said it is also somewhat staining. Precisely apply because I found out if I got it out of where it should be applied, it did not easily wipe off and the stain was still there along with my lipstick for a lot of the day. Also be careful on what the lip tint gets on (fingers, clothes, porous countertops, etc) as it is difficult to get off.
This review was collected as part of a promotion. * The Ere Perez beetroot cheek and lip tinted came in the color Joy. Joy is a bright cherry red color that has a bit of an orange tint to the color. The applicator is strong and not flimsy. When applying it on my lips it went on smooth and covered a good portion of my lips with one swipe. As the product is a tint multiple layers were needed to cover the area and have a build up to be an even layer. The product is light weight and because of that it feels as if you aren't wearing anything on your lips. The color is bright and very pigmented and because of that I choose to not try it on my cheeks. I tried it out after eating and learned that it does not fade evenly. My lips did feel hydrated and unlike other tints didn't have a dry feeling. The finish is a bit glossy rather than a matte color. * As someone new to the world of tints, I was so excited to try this. I was curious to see how it would compare to traditional blushes and lipsticks. 

Starting with thr basics, the packaging: it is sleek and minimalist, which I appreciate. The compact size makes it easy to carry in my purse, perfect for on-the-go touch-ups.
Applying the tint was straightforward, even for a beginner like me. The product glides smoothly onto both cheeks and lips. I found that using my fingers to blend the tint gave me the best results, providing a natural, flushed look. The color is buildable, so you can go for a subtle hint of color or a more dramatic pop, depending on your preference. It left mr with a vibrant, rosy hue that looks very natural on my skin. I got shade ""joy"" which i was worried would be too bright and clownish on me. But it turned out to be a versatile shade that I think would complement a variety of skin tones. The texture is lightweight and not sticky, which I loved. It feels comfortable on the skin and doesn't dry out my lips, a common issue I've had with other lip products.
I was also quite impressed with the staying power. It lasted several hours on both my cheeks and lips without the need for reapplication. Even after a meal, the color on my lips faded gracefully, leaving a nice stain rather than completely disappearing.

Overall, I am thrilled with this product! As my first foray into tints, it has set the bar high. The ease of use, natural finish, and impressive longevity make it a fantastic addition to my makeup routine. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile, high-quality tint that enhances natural beauty. * I used this Ere Perez Beetroot Cheek and Lip Tint in the red color and thought it was a very nice color payoff! I've not previously used a product like this so it was my first experience. The product was very liquidy and had very strong, red coloring. I would definitely recommend to start small with application and add more as needed especially on the cheeks as this was just a lot of color at once. I applied dots on my face and lips then blended them out with my finger. My finger was very stained red but I was able to blend it out well on my cheeks and lips best with my finger. I don't really like wearing red on my lips or face but this gave me a nice flushed appearance and looked very natural. I love that this product uses a lot of natural ingredients and it is really buildable if you want more rich coloring on your lips or face! I think you have to remember that it is not a lipstick or lip gloss and adjust your expectations and usage with this in mind! It does what it's supposed to do! Was certainly a nice product and my first of its kind I've tried! Definitely worth a try! * I am a retired crunchy beauty babe. I will always happily use natural based beauty products, however, I'm very tired these days, and got to a point where it wasn't great for my mental health to focus on all the good, bad, and ugly ingredients out there. That being said, Ere Perez really appeals to that natural loving part of my personality, and I was so excited to try the beetroot tint.
I definitely found some pros and cons with the product, and was left with mixed feelings. She's very pigmented, which is great! I on the other hand, am lacking in the pigment department. I really wanted to like this as a cheek tint or blush, but it appears this is either very much the wrong color for me, I lack the skills necessary to apply it properly, or a combination of both. I tried a few times with various tools, and I don't think we're meant to be a blush relationship.  I am curious about using the stain on my cheeks as part of a tantour situation, but I still think the red is probably just too red for me in this scenario. 
Just because we can't have a cheeky relationship doesn't mean we can't work things out! I really like the beetroot tint as a lip stain! I have been in a brown lip era, so it was a bit of a shock to my senses when I first popped it on as lip color, but it made me remember that sometimes a true red lip is what you need. (Plus, a red lip is a great way to say ""eff you"" to fascism if you're familiar with the history of a red lip.) The stain on its own is a really lovely true red. It is sticky for a moment, but that texture wipes off to a long lasting stain. After a few wears, I realized that it will calm down to a more casual dark pink on its own. I would avoid eating a greasy snack while wearing it unless you're ready to reapply after. 
It has a very mild non offensive flavor when applied - slightly sweet and not very beet-like. Also, it was partner approved. Inappropriate comments were made by him, so I believe he rates it 5 stars. I really hope Ere Perez expands the beetroot line into more colors, so maybe I can find the right cheek shade down the road. 

This review was collected as part of a promotion. * As someone with a very busy schedule, I love adding versatile makeup products to my routine, so I was super excited to try this 2-in-1 lip and cheek tint. The Beetroot Cheek & Lip Tint has become a new must-have for me.

This tint is highly pigmented, so it will definitely last a long time!

I found the best way to use it is to start with a small amount and build up from there. One small dot is all I need to achieve a great blush look for my cheeks. For my lips, I love using a small brush to blend.

I love that I can go from a natural look to a more bold look with just one product!

This is a long-lasting tint; I haven't needed to retouch my makeup (lips or cheeks) while using it! Also, it leaves my lips feeling so hydrated and moisturized!

Overall, this is a great tint that delivers gorgeous results!

I tried to build it up, but couldn't get color payoff.  I've been much happier with liquid blush from the drugstore.  You might have better results with a darker shade than Rose Riot. * I purchased the shade cheeky coral. I have light to medium skin and it does not show up on my skin at all. It breaks apart on my skin then disappears. Ive tried using a sponge, brush, putting it directly on my cheeks, putting it on the back of my hand and no luck :( the color is beautiful though! Does anyone have any tips and tricks on how to get this product to show up and stay on the skin? * Had rhis on my favorites page for a year and extremely disappointed. First use, way too much product came out that i had to waste. Does not blend well, have to use an additonal blush to blend into face. * Perfect finish, can use it alone or layer with a powder blush. It doesn't move my base products around and it doesn't exaggerate my poor skin texture. Ive used multiple brushes to see if it would change the look or finish, but it always blends seamlessly. Highly recommend * I'm not much for make up, so switching to a liquid blush was intimidating but it's pretty easy to use!  You can layer up on how much you want the color to pop, and it stays on an oily face like mine ALL DAY.  I get compliments every time I wear this stuff! 
It's not a crème consistency, so careful with how you squeeze the tube! * Doesn't show any color on my light skin, and so much products leaks out when taking the cap off. Very disappointing!"

I normally like Milani products but this blush is a no go, still prefer prestige brands Blush sticks. * I love, blends so beautifully. So creamy! Can add more for more color tone! Never patchy. My favorite ever, all I do is recommend * Wonderfully creamy, beautiful colors * First, this handy little palette definitely gets the job done and on a pretty good range of skin tones; however, more shades are needed! These powders have a luxury feel to them. Almost buttery, a little can go a very long way! That being said, if you have VERY light skin tones, you're going to want to go in with a light hand and build! On the other hand if you have dark skin tones, you're going to be able to load up your brush and apply. They do build nicely; still though too much of a good thing is too much. So while I absolutely love this concept like the many ""multiple steps palettes""  out there, it's not a one size fits all. Unfortunately finding that one size fits all is extremely hard to find in this department; that's the beauty of people being different! 
In the end, it's a fantastic little palette that I'd highly recommend; especially in an MUA bag or any makeup lovers collection that could benefit from these shades. Great price for great formulas. Now let's see more and more. * Skin is dewy not greasy. Gives a healthy glow. Also, I don't use heavy foundation, I use a CC cream with SPF.

You can also mix all of them together for a beautiful flushed look. The shimmer gives your skin a boost of radiance without looking glittery. It smells just like my favorte butter bronzer. You still get the cute little mirror under the product and a tiny brush (that I know none of us ever actually use). I will say, I think they know this now because the brush feels dry and scratchy. Think old barbie doll hair...BUT since most of us use our own trusted brushes this doesn't effect how much I love this blush."
