0,nyx professional makeup,buttermelt pressed powder blush,pimprod2045333,2624632," * I have been searching for a true purple blush for a while and while the shade ""all the butta"" wasn't as purple as I had hoped and also did stain my pale face a bit (my fault lol I used it as eyeshadow) I cannot even mark it down for that. the formula is incredible and it blends flawlessly. I rarely find a power face product that I can use in the winter without feeling chalky * I love these blushes but I recently found out they have almond butter in them and I'm allergic to almonds. I haven't had a bad reaction but I'm scared to continue using. I hope NYX releases more blushes with nut free ingredients for people with nut allergies. * This smells so good that I want to eat it! It blends amazingly and is so pretty. * It was long lasting, which is great. I grabbed this for a trial run for my makeup and where it didn't work for me. The color eas entirely too bright for my caramel skin color. * I bought My Butta Half and All the Butta and the colors are beautiful and blend like a dream! They can be subtle if you use a light hand or you can easily build them up~ The colors I got are nice cool/neutral tones and All the Butta was my first purple blush and it was the perfect shade for a flushed berry/mod purple look. 
If you want something not so pigmented I would steer away from this though. * it smells so good and the formula is soft and really pigmented. it has a highlighter like finish and i found it really easy to blend out, the colors are so pretty and overall i would highly recommend!! * Its wayy darker than the image and not at all matte. Im very very dissapointed."
1,perricone md,no makeup blush,pimprod2004408,2541775," * This is by far my favorite EVER blush!! I have goofy combo skin and some fine lines-this blush goes on so nicely and it doesn't make my face look more oily in my t zone and it does not settle into drier skin and lines! Absolutely worth the price and I hope they never stop making this blush! * I love this and the color but it used to have spf in it. Now it's just a regular blush. I noticed the brand has been doing away with the products being spf. Which is a shame since that's the reason I stocked up in early spring. Now since it has no spf, I am in no hurry to purchase. I still miss there spf gloss that used to be this color. * I've been using this blush for over a year now and I love this stuff!  I have dry, flaky skin and using powder blush accentuates my dry spots. This blush gives me a beautiful glow with some added moisture.  Long lasting and beautiful! I really think this blush would be good for all skin types especially dryer skin, a little goes a long way! * I love this blush in the summer when I need a bit of a boost on my cheeks for going out after doing some sun loving activities. I have sensitive skin, so when working outdoors I can only have sunscreen. Due to the sunscreen in the blush this helps being able to put some neutral makeup on for work without the risk of my face getting sunburned with regular makeup. I love the neutral color. Perricone MD used to sell an spf lipgloss in this color as well, I wish they brought back the lipgloss as it smelled great and worked fantastically. * CONS 
1. This blush burnt my skin. 
I applied the blush almost daily for several months. 2 weeks ago the skin on my cheek bones where the blush touched (in the exact shape I apply my blush) got a terrible allergic reaction: painful, red, extremely dry and bumpy. It has been several days of using soothing skincare, and the irritation is still there, although very slowly subsiding. 
2. As other reviewershave mentioned, the cap cracks easily when you screw the top closed. 

PROS 
The shade is buildable and starts very subtle. I have light skin, cool undertone, and this blush looked beautiful. * i only used this once or twice. i screwed the cap on too tight one time and the lid breaks and the stopper sank to the bottom. please replace the cheap plastic with metal. * I love the color of this blush and it blends beautifully. Big drawback though is the packaging. The lid completely cracked when I tightened it. I love this blush but now I can't take it anywhere. Please fix this packaging!!!!!"
2,e.l.f. cosmetics,camo liquid blush,pimprod2042954,2617738," * I love this liquid blush! It rivals bigger brands with the pigment and blending ability. And you can't beat the price. * this is a very pretty color in a light pink blush. It's very cute for summertime in spring time. * Love the color it's beautiful and really brings out my checks the color is like a bubblegum pink perfect for the spring seasons really high and feels weightless on and blends so well perfect color for me over all very happy with everything loving it all * this is the first liquid blush I've tried and wow it is so pigmented. The formula is so creamy and goes on so smooth. I will say a little definitely goes a long way. It also stays on for way longer than I thought it would. It lasted the entire day! Definitely will be repurchasing again once this tube is done! * I really like this lilac liquid blush. It looks good on light skin and has great pigment. A little goes a long way! It's lightweight and blends smoothly leaving a soft, dewy finish. I look forward to trying other colors! I received this product for the purpose of this review. * Elf Camo Liquid Blushes are highly pigmented, creamy. They don't dry down too fast or too much and can be applied with fingers or brushes, creating a noticeable flush with a hydrated-looking dew. That result was from three little dots of each on my cheeks. So, now we know that you have to use the tiniest, tiniest, micro amounts. So I highly recommend this product 🩷 * I have fair neutral skin and this shows up a beautiful pale cool pink shade. I was a bit nervous about the pigment from using other elf blushes, but it was mild enough and blended out so well. This is very much ""cold girl"" makeup but I love it. This is becoming an everyday staple. 

I did receive this product for free in exchange for an honest review."
3,dior,rosy glow blush,pimprod2039824,2612203," * Very pretty blush. I'm hoping it will look great during the summer when I have more color as I chose the cherry shade which is absolutely gorgeous. * I love this blush! I use it over my YSL liquid blush abd the combo is unreal. Please bring back the lavender shade! It's sooo pretty! * This blush is great on top of a liquid or cream blush. * not very pigmented. I bought this bc it was used at my wedding and I loved it. The one I gave is not pigmented at all, maybe I got a bad batch? * I love this blush! It goes on perfectly with just a simple blush brush. It is light and non-greasy, and always looks fabulous! I use it to add a pink glow wherever I want it. * The package came perfect, and the color is so pretty * This color is so flattering and i will say i try to stay away from blush becuse i tend to have a heavy hand and then I get frustrated having to remove it and start over etc. 
People are giving this bad reviews for lack of pigment. I personally love a natural look, and this blush will allow you to achieve that but also is very buildable if you do want a more pigmented cheek. I have never been so impressed by a blush before. I was very scared I was going to hate it but im so glad I gave it a shot! The color is so flattering on me while pale and tan!"
4,benefit cosmetics,liquid lip blush & cheek tint,pimprod2008308,2547730," * yes a classic but for me i easily have other stains that give me more pigment and last longer. I also find the like water formula to be harder to set and build up unlike say a thicker gel. i still use it because its a great color and feels like nothing on the lips or can be a great no makeup lip product * Love this stuff. Been using it since it came out. Just wish they had the bigger sized bottle. * I bought two of these. I bough the chachatint and the original rose benetint. They are two completely different textures and in my opinion should not be in the same line or category. The chachatint was more of a cream texture and was the perfect flush of orangey pink on cheeks and lips for a tropical destination. I loved it and was inspired to buy a more 'neutral', 'everyday' shade that made it easy to get ready. The original benetint rose stain seemed like the right shade, however the texture is COMPLETELY different and is more of a thin, watery consistency. It is hard to get an even coat and seems wrong to put anywear but the lips. I was hoping to wear it like the other, both on the cheeks and lips. I am disappointed and think this definitely needs a revamp to match the other stains in the line. I am still wanting to try the floratint on the premise that its the same texture as the chachatint stain. * This stuff smells so good and is a nice lip and cheek tint but it rubs off and doesn't last very long. * I love this benetint but there's one thing I don't like . It's really easy to spill and it smells like chemicals and it also taste like it. * Cute color and lasts long on lips as long as you leave it be! * love this but be careful if u leave it on too long unblended, then it might stay that way and, by that i mean it won't blend ever."
5,nars,blush,pimprod2044741,2621261," * I have used this blush for years. I love the original color Orgasm which is a pretty pink with shimmer. I bought this recently, the brush wont pick up color and the shade is now more of an organge. I get that companies need to find ways to make more revenue by cutting corners… but this is a terrible product now. * I will always have this blush in my stash. It's timeless and beautiful and makes you glow. * There is no pigment at all in the new formula. I have used this blush for 10 years, and now it is absolutely unusable. * Thought it was just me but reading the comments I see I'm not alone.  Long time iser of Orgasm and the new formula is awful.  Color is basically gone and does not last. * Does not show up. At all. Too glittery * The new formula is a different color and now its half the size as the old one?!? I am so disappointed… * Yes, the Orgasm color definitely changed and for those who loved it like me, Amour is a really nice substitute."
6,pixi,on-the-glow blush tinted moisture stick,pimprod2032976,2598116," * Ruby is such a pretty color with a bright pop but it's very blendable. It's not too bright at all. Looks pretty against pale winter skin, as well as tan skin (which I am so resdy for!). I use a stiff brush and kind of stipple on then blend as needed. * I own two of these blush sticks and love both of them. The colors look good on my lips and my cheeks. It even lasts forever and is super easy to get off. You need to try this. * Fell apart and got stuck in the tube 2 days after use. Highly don't recommend this product. Way too expensive for it to just fall apart! * Absolutely love this blush i bought it a  few days ago and i love it definitely recommend * Great product but as soon as you put on setting spray it goes away .. * This an amazing product. It blends amazing, not overpowering on your face, colors are amazing. * This is suck good blush I can't even complain. It applies to smoothly and blends in so easily I love it so much! 5/5 I would recommend you buy this if your looking for a forever blush!"
7,pur,silky tint creamy multitasking stick,pimprod2044097,2620463," * I rated this highlighter a 3 out of 5. I will definitely continue to use because I've been wanting to switch to more of a liquid highlighter versus powder. A little goes a long way with this product and I like the glowy shimmer of the finished look. Only thing is I feel like I didn't really notice the glow/shimmer much when I tried to capture a picture of the finished look (hence no picture of the finished look). I like that this could also be a lipstick but again, a little goes a long way on the lips. Can definitely be paired with lip liner and lip gloss. I would purchase this product again. * I love how simple the packaging I. I also enjoy how multi use it can be. It is great to use as a blush as well as a lip stick. It adds a great pop of color to any look that I want to create. It does not have a strong scent. The texture is smooth like a balm. * The Pur you go pearl multitasking stick is beautiful! The packaging makes it super easy to dispense the product and convenient to take on the go. The pearly color worked really well for my olive undertones. 

I use two methods for application, the first just my hands - I'll warm the product up on the back of my hand then apply using my fingers to the high points of my cheeks and nose. The second - If I want to get a more precise application I'll pick up the product up with a brush and apply to the inner corner of my eyes and brow bone. 

The product wears well and layers well both under and over powder. I'm interested to try the more pinky shade now! Highly recommend this! * I really love this multi stick from Pur! I got the shade You Go Pearl which is a super nice champagne cream highlight. It blends super beautifully and doesn't look cakey. * I love cream blushes, and was excited to i
Imitry this one,  cute packaging, it's very creamy, easy to blend, but it's not very pigmented, the color payoff was not noticeable on my dark complexion. * This cream stick is the perfect addition to my makeup case. I like that I can use it for my cheeks and my lips, as it minimizes the need for other products, and as a redhead, it looks good on both. The texture is so creamy and blends perfectly with a finger or a brush. It's light, so you won't be overpowered with color. Definitely buying another when I run out! * The PUR Silky Tint Creamy Multitasking Stick is a game-changer! Sleek packaging, no scent (perfect for sensitive noses), creamy texture, blends like a dream, and leaves a silky, radiant finish. A must-have for effortless, natural beauty! Would buy again and again!"
8,juvia's place,blushed duo,pimprod2025280,2583745," * I love these blushes. They are extremely pigmented. Great price. * Ive tried rhe juvia place eye shadows and loved so declded to try the bronzer. This product is SO slept on! Great value, highly pigmented and diverse. Comparable to my high end products. * This blush is very pigmented I love it so much. I recommend going in with barley any blush because a bit goes a long way but other than that i love it so much and i cant wait to get volume 4!! * I love ulta * I got this duo as a Christmas gift, and I love it so much!! it almost seems like a dupe for the Patrick Ta blush duo (I'm not sure what its called) it's sooo pigmented. the only thing is that it is little hard to blend, but not bad. * I was influenced by tik tok to buy this and it did not disappoint * all the shapes are so pretty so pigmented and it's such an affordable pallet"
9,morphe,huephoric rush 3-in-1 silk blush,pimprod2045434,2625272," * Energized is such a gorgeous color. This blends so nicely and stays on all day. I would definitely buy more. * I bought this because it is a perfect color for me.  Although I was hesitant because it didn't look like there was much in the compact, but there is more than I expected.   I love the softness of it and it's easy to build.  A little goes a long way. * I got the bright pink color- be careful! Its super pigmented so a little goes a long way. However, its very pretty * I was looking for a very creamy, easy to blend blusher. The sample in the store for this blusher felt this way. It is not as easy to blend, and the color is very intense even tho I bought a light color. I find it works if I blend it with a little creamy concealer. * I was apprehensive about the color Touched. But I'm not gonna lie, it's actually stunning as a lip as well as blush!! * Gives you a sun kissed effect. Great for summer. * A little goes a long way! You don't need a lot to have good pigmentation. This product it's really easy to blend and work with, colors are truly beautiful."
10,too faced,cloud crush blurring blush,pimprod2036986,2603636," * I don't know if it was mis-labeled or what, but it's way darker than I wanted. I wanted something light and shimmery. And, the smell kind of grosses me out. * The color looks so pretty. Blurring effect is real. * The color looks so pretty. Blurring effect is real. * I have five different colors of this blush because I love it so much. I sometimes do some mixing of two shades for a custom look. Been wearing blush for decades, used so many brands but this is the perfect formula for me. Love the texture, depth of color and staying power plus it smells delicious. The compact is a nice size and super attractive. I'm 62, still have oily skin, light-medium olive with yellow tones. If Too Faced ever discontinues this blush, I will be so upset! * First off these are very small , rediculously small . Probably the smallest blush ive ever purchased at this price .They smell like candy , the pigmentation is insane and it builds up well . Just didnt expect it to be the size of a pendant . * Inwould not recommend this blue. 
The pigmentation sucks and it takes ALOT just for it to just start showing on my cheeks. 

Also, the smell of this blush… I HATE IT! 
I think I hate the smell of it more than anything else. * Love this blush, smells sooo good. It looks really nice but it doesnt match the photo, the shade is off"

12,juvia's place,blushed liquid blush,pimprod2038948,2609909," * I've never used liquid blush before, but with my oily skin it does help my blush powder to last longer. The color is intense so I barely need to apply much. * Quality is great but I would say it depends on your personal preference what kind of look you're going for if you're more of a dewy girl then this might not exactly be the right fit you can make it work but it's more like a lasting mass effect * . * I own almost every color of this blush and the blushlighter. Tulip or Rosey Posey are my everyday go to blushes,  but the others have a place.  sometimes I use them as eyeshadow. 

For reference, on a skin tone scale from fair - dark,  my skin is a medium shade, light brown. This blush was created for darker skin tones, so it is very pigmented. Unfortunately, some people aren't used to buying products that are highly pigmented so they say,  ""it's too pigmented"" because they don't know how to use thie product in a way that works for them. However, the learning curve is not steep.  the lighter your skin, the less product you use. it's not that hard to grasp.  I've seen videos of women with darker skin tones using one full dot or more on each cheek, which is wayyyyy too much for my skin tone.  I use the tiniest of tiny dots, I blend with a brush or beauty blender,  and I always get a beautiful natural finish. 

To be fair,  I do not need, like, or wear foundation,  so I can't speak to how it blends with a full face of makeup, but it looks beautiful on bare freshly moistured skin, giving a slightly dewy finish that settles into a natural skin finish. 

The consistency reminds me of liquid lipstick without the oily texture. The only con that I have is that I wish the tip of the applicator wands were much smaller to avoid using too much product. to get the amount I need I have to carefully place a  pin head amount on my cheek, but the brush tip gives almost a dime size amount. * This is so beautiful! Just be mindful as it is extremely pigmented so a little bit goes a long way! * You only need a dot of this it is so pigmented and last a long time. I'm trying all cream makeup first then powders and needed a cream blush. This is def. A great product I wish their shades were a bit softer but other than that beautiful! * A little goes a long way so be very mindful when applying this. This product lasted all day for me but was also easy to remove. I would definitely recommend this if you're a blush gal."

14,tarte,shape tape glow blush bar,pimprod2044745,2622622," * I love this palette. Im not big on blush because my cheeks are red. Im always trying to cover the redness. I love all three shades of the lighter one. The highlighter is amazing looks good everywhere. I wear it as eyeshadow also. Im shocked but i love the blush. Thanks again tarte!!! * This palette is amazing!! The bronzer is the perfect shade, im light-medium skin tone and i find it perfect. The blushes are gorgeous!! Pigmented and beautiful! I kind of compared the blushes to the new rare one, but i like this better. I really recommend this palette, if you can find it, run for it! * I was so excited to see Tartes new glow bar the colors are perfect for summer * The blushes and highlighter in this palette are pigmented and gorgeous!!! * I bought this and have been lovong the sparkling blushes and the highlighter. These are super pigmented and pretty for spring and summer * I was hesitant to order this palette seeing there wasn't any reviews & also knowing the lack of tone range within Tarte's line however....this is beautiful!! I ordered the 'Berry Bar' ((darker one)) and it does compliment my skin tone perfectly, which is medium to tan in most makeup lines. I can get A LOT of color payoff using a light hand,  every color has a dewy glow, and lasted thru my 10 hour work day. The only critique I can imagine would be the bronzer not working for anyone darker than a tan skin tone. If you have a deep color, the bronzer may just give you a pretty glow without a pigment. Overall, I really like this palette thus far & can most def see me reaching for this more than not!"

16,e.l.f. cosmetics,halo glow blush beauty wand,pimprod2038825,2609251," * Lightweight and easy to use. Make sure to spread it quickly as it dries fast. Love the added glow! * I bought the blush, highlighter, and contour. When i twist the cap back on, the product oozes out of the seam. This makes it hard to store because it then gets all over everything else. I even tried using less and this still happens. Will be looking into other products. This was good for it's price though. * I love this if you it is not to my much it is  perfect * i use this every time i do my makeup, it isnt too matte and leaves you with a nice natural look. I got the rose you slay shade and its amazing on my pale skin * super soft applicator, wish they came in some non shimmery colors too. * Loved this so much!! * Ive had this blush for about a year and tried it several times, both with base makeup and alone to give it a fair shot and every single time it would streak and stick to whatever i was applying it with. super frustrating as it also ruins any makeup you applied beforehand. elfs liquid camo blushes are beautiful and id recommend those all day but this formula just didnt work for me at all."
17,stila,blush & bronze hydro-blur cheek duo,pimprod2042663,2617321," * Obsessed. It is easy to use, compact, travels well and convenient! Definitely will be buying in other colors as well. * The blush is very pretty but the contour part came smushed and once i turned the tube to bring product down it completely fell off the tube. Not my favorite for my first time trying this product * I have fallen in love with this duo! I got Grapefruit/Caramel and the colors are amazing! Super creamy and easily blends. The case is cute and works great and the product lasts a long time even with daily use! * Love this hybrid gel cheek duo * I purchased the Grapefruit and Caramel color. I tried it out with my fingers and a brush.

The good;
-Pretty colors. They swatch mat but do blend out sheer and become part of the skin. 
-Elegant formulation with a creamy and light feel on the skin. 
-Easy to use, compact and portable.
-No discernable scent. 
-Neither the bronzer nor the blush have any glowy particles. 

The not so good;
-I am fair but cool toned and ALL the colors are warm on me. Why Stila, why? 
-Once applied the blush and bronzer become sheer and the colors disappear as they blend in. 
-I had to do multiple layers before I could truly see any color payoff.
I am tempted to purchase a darker color combination just so it would show up. 

Overall this is a clever, very convenient, and  portable product. Perhaps great for on the go touchups. But it is so sheer and blends out on my skin so much that there is virtually nothing left. * I really like this Stilla Blush & Bronze Hydro-Blur cheek duo. It blebds well and looks so natural. Its not sticky or tacky at all. It doesnt turn orange color either.  Doesnt look fake. * Based on the photos, I'd have shied away from the intense shades but they really sheer out on my light olive skin so I'm so glad I saw them in person because I would've ended up picking a lighter shade (and I might do that, too). Loving the Guava! It is lasting longer than powder blush (even with a setting spray) and is super convenient to throw into my bag for on the go touch ups. I even dabbed some of the bronzer side on in my crease when I was out and my eyeshadow needed a little pick me up. SOLD!!!"
18,nars,afterglow liquid blush,pimprod2039276,2617037," * This is my favorite liquid blush and pretty much the only one I buy anymore. I am fair complected unless i have a good spray tan to fake it. Behave and orgasm both work on my skin tone. * This blush has been my go-to for years now. I just ordered my third bottle of ""behave"" and I hope NARS never changes their formula. For reference, I'm **super pale** with neutral undertones and ""behave"" looks great. I also have very sensitive skin but this product has never made me break out. Love love love. * Very disappointed in this product.  It looks pretty when you apply it, but there is so little pigment that after it dries it looks like you didn't do anything.  And it's so expensive for what you get. * Love the control you have with the color. You can put as much or as little as possible on , either for trips to the grocery store, or an evening out with your date. Highly recommended. Ill never buy anoth bludh again. * Insatiable looks dark in the bottle, but is a great color on a pale neutral face. It gives a pop of color which looks very natural for anyone neutral or pale olive. It is subtle enough for pale complexions to wear without looking garish. For reference I wear NARS light reflecting foundation in Mont Blanc. * These are honestly the best liquid blushes and blend like a dream. 
The color is beautiful and gives a glowy look.
Little goes a long way. 
Do not e afraid to try Insatiable, it's a gorgeous color! Especially for fall. * This blush blends in beautifully and the soft colors have staying power.During beauty steal weeks I purchased another brand. Will not repeat that mistake."

20,fenty beauty by rihanna,cheeks out freestyle cream blush,pimprod2031376,2592449," * I love this blush profoundly. Its more expensive than the blush products i was using before. But its so worth the cost. A little goes such a long way and theyre so creamy i just love them. * I totally got the wrong shade for my skin tone with my first purchase - it was a little too orangey for everyday wear, which is absolutely on me. This time, I got the coral and I am eagerly awaiting its arrival - the formula is really really nice, probably my favorite blush I own (even over Milk's!) If you're looking for a really nice cream blush - this is the way to go! * I got the Fuego blush, and the color is beautiful, but there is too much glitter in it  for me, I prefer a more natural look. I might use it as an eyeshadow instead because I love the color so much. * Glides on smoothly, color is vibrant and can be muted. I am sixty and cannot believe how easy it is to apply. * Big melons is my go to daily.  After washing/ moisturizing my face,  I pop this on and a glossy lip stain and im good to go. Gives perfect color and life esp on the days where you don't want to wear much makeup. By far the best coral pigment I've found (coral is my staple so I've been through many).  Creamy and blends beautifully. * Gorgeous pop of color, it lasts and doesnt fade like some blushes. It is a bit smaller than I would've liked foe the price so it's not going to last as long as my other blushes just due to the size. * Perfect creamy consistency for everyday wear, doesn't require a ton of blending and wears well with almost every product"

22,tarte,blush tape liquid blush,pimprod2038505,2610305," * This blush is an absolute standout. It's my new favorite—it beats NARS Orgasm and Too Faced for me, and it gives Sabrina Carpenter vibes. Very pigmented and easy to blend. I know a lot of people don't like the packaging but I think it's perfect. The sponge tip keeps it from being drippy or messy and makes application easy, though I still use a normal blush brush to blend. The finish has a nice sheen to it—kind of a blush-highlight combo, which is exactly what I look for. Can't recommend this enough! * I tried using this but it ended up smearing my makeup. It does not blend well and the shimmer look too weird on textured skin. If you have perfectly flawless skin then you can wear this but otherwise i recommend you stay away. * Has a light shimmer, I'm very far skinned so I was afraid it would be too dark but it's very soft and you can build on it for darker hues. It's light, soft and doesn't irritate my skin. Perfect liquid blush. * Bought from Ulta when it was on sale * Absolutely love this product and will definitely buy it again. * Mine was turned off, and it leaked everywhere. All over my other makeup and makeup case :( it doesn't stop coming out! the tip and cap are drenched in liquid blush! The bronzer I got was the opposite, it won't come out (it's in the on position) and it's near full. I had to cut it open for the product. Ugh. * Love the liquid blush"

Applies well and blending is very easy. Highly recommend this brand! Stays put bc it goes from cream to powder. Great for combo or oily skin types! * I got this blush in the shade Paris and its is a beautiful blush. However, I'm not sure if this happens to everyone, but for me the blush keeps falling out from the container and I've never had it upside down, I've never dropped it, so I dont know whats causing this. * SO easy to use, I love the packaging, & that I can carry it around in my purse to re-apply (although I didn't have to because it lasted all night!), and it blended in so nicely. Highly recommended for those that are on the go and want a flawless look * If you are expecting this to be anything othet than a powder blush i think you will be disappointed. It is a good blush. However If you are expecting it to be as blendable as a cream, as it claims, its not. I was worried the first time i tried to blend it because Its harder to blend out than my cream blushes. However once it blends out it looks great and lasts a while. I have paris and sydney and i love both colors. I would pick them up again. * If you are expecting this to be anything othet than a powder blush i think you will be disappointed. It is a good blush.

24,mac,glow play blush,pimprod2013050,2583438," * I bought this blush two different times with two different orders under a month's span and both times it shipped to me it arrived broken. Im sure its a beautiful color, but theyre both broken to the point where i cannot even use them at least once. Im returning both unfortunately. * This blush is absolutely beautiful!! Not only do I glow to the gods but it lasts!! I literally plan on buying them all!! * The texture freaked me out at first, but it's so light and creamy. It's great for my older skin. * At a certain point, I moved from powder to creme blush and I've tried most, this at the top. I apply this formula with a beauty blender and it goes on so well. Application is easy and the color (blush please) is subtle and perfect on my light to medium color skin. My only complaint? I'd love to see more colors! * I was searching for a product that blends easily and stays on...this is it * Bought this on a whim and loved it so much that i bought 2 more!! Blush please is my favorite on my fair skin for everyday, but they're all great! I put them over powder and they don't disrupt anything underneath, and they give my cheeks a very subtle but healthy glow. The blend is seamless and they have great lasting power with me working a 12 hour shift!! Highly recommend, these deserve more hype! * I have used SO MANY different blushes, but this one I can't get over! I got it in the shade blush please which given my fair completion, shows up more peachy. Its creamy, but works beautifully on both bare skin and powder which is why I love it!"

Im not sure why because it is a newer palette. * I actually like these colors! They all work for my skincare. But - and big but here - this smells awful. Like old, expired even? I can't use it because i hate the smell so much. And it is a little smaller than i expected, hard to get a brush into one pan. * zero pigment. i had to build it up like crazy to see anything show and when i looked at myself after a couple hours, the powders were no where to be seen. no staying power * I love the two blushes and the highlighter! They have great pigment and the highlighter sits nice. No glitter!

The bronzer however is not very pigmented. I tried to build it up but it fell short * I really love this palette.  I recently got rid of my old makeup to try to downsize to the essentials only. This palette is perfect. It has everything you need and doesn't take up much space. I bought during the ulta deals so the price was perfect. * I have the Berry saturation palette and im not disappointed. I can use this all over my face even as eyeshadow. The bronzer is a bit dark for my medium skin but useful as a crease shade. Its a very quick look with one palette. Love it and highly recommend. * I was hoping this palette would be high quality for it being Smashbox brand, but like others have said, the product is not very pigmented. The exception is the highlighter, it's really pretty and buttery in texture. The palette I received also has a very strange, offputting smell. Way better products out there for the price!"

First GLEE, now You Had Me at Merlot! The gal tried this one on me and I like it, but I still wanted Merlot! Pretty, but not as rosy as I would like! * Gorgeous rosy shade!! Goes on nicely and lasts all day on my oily skin! * I love the color and application, bit it doesnt last on me. I use primer and setting spray and within 1-2 hours it is all faded. I tried alone and over creme blush no difference. I love the look initially and it is very pigme ted on my fair skin, but disappointing. I have kiss of copper. * Flows evenly upon my skin"

It's so easy to blend and the blushing bride shade is beautiful. I use on my apples of my cheeks and a little on my eyes for work just simply pretty. I was already obsessed with tarte products and this just added another must have for me. * I really wanted to love this blush, I got the color ""paaarty"" and it was very light barley showed up on my cheeks. I had to reapply multiple times just to get any color. * This blush is so beautiful and it lasts FOREVER. I wear it everyday and I've had it for AT LEAST 5 years.. no kidding. * Rosey cheeks * I love this powder blush in big ego. Suits my cool undertone skin perfectly. Highly pigmented so a little goes a long way. My favorite part it stays on all day, never have to reapply, even when I workout or do gardening, or a night of dancing."

Pillow talk is universally flattering but very flattering for brown hair/eye coloring * love this blush!!!! * I absolutley do not like how messy the packaging gets, but im in love with the formula. I got the pillow talk one, and it looks so beautiful on my skin.  It's definitley buildable, so it worked well during the summer when i was more tan, and it works well now that my skin is light. The formula is sophisticated.... It makes my cheecks look glowy, without any shimmer.  It also lasts all day on my oily skin. It's such a joy to use (i even use it over my powder with no issues), and i find myself forcing myself to use my other blushes. * amazing product * I'm no makeup artist but my amazing grandma just bought me one of these and I LOVE IT!!!! I got it in the shade pink pop and it is SO pigmented! * I wanted to love this blush, the color is very natural and it lasts a while, but its trickier than just a quick dab and im out the door, i am not precise on my makeup, i like doing my makeup fast and efficiently. I had heard alot about this blush, it seemed easy and the colors were beautiful, i gave it a try at first the application was easy, but the blending took a long time and i was getting impatient, i wasnt able to build & blend, but at last it set and i was fine. The following day i open it and the product was everywhere. I hate being wasteful but i had to wipe everything off because it was dripping, i had closed it tight after i used it so i was confused as to why it spilled everywhere. Color is gorgeous, the applying is what really sucks and the messiness of it, its hard to continue its use so i just stopped. * The cons about this product is that after one use it will get very massy and will spill and leak out of the bottle. In my opinion I would not recommend this product."

Ordered color ""To the 10"" for my fair skin with warm undertones. It's not my go-to. * I am very choosy about what colors I put on my cheeks. Normally, I will go with something a little bit more softer and Less pink. But using this along with my peachy pink lipstick. It gives me a summary Sunkist look. Which is Something I wanted to do for a while. Absolutely love this color. It's very Pigmented so you only need a little bit. * I loved this blush but it shattered so easily. Also, the lid refused to close so my blush always stayed open. * Very pretty color and great price point * The color payoff was nice enough the one and only time I was able to use it, but thr product itself is fragile — it shattered from drawer jostling and could not be re-pressed (it kept flaking in sheets and cracking across the surface as it was pressed). * Goes on perfectly for a natural coverage. I was told I look like I came from the beach. * I bought the shade papaya even though it was out of my comfort zone. I love it so much! I always go in with cream products first and set with powder products. This blush looks so nice and natural over everything and it's become my favorite! I love it!!"

Both blush and highlighter not adhered to pan then continued to crumble.  I have purchased so many Charlotte Tilbury products, some great products but rendered unusable by the cheap packaging.  CT is marketed as luxury however there are so many better luxury brands at same (or lower) price point with both exceptionally good product and packaging. CT needs review her product packaging, if the product is broken to the point of being unusable or messy people will go elsewhere. I know im done * I gave one star because of the e color, the light pink blush is pigmented and pretty on as is the highlighter. 
However for a Charlotte Tillbury product, supposedly lux, i would not expext the product to fall out of the pan upon opening the compact and be broken up.  Its obviously not a packaging error as im seeing it repeatedly in reviews that every brand new Hollywood Blush & Go palette has this problem no mattet where its purchased from. I have ised the sculpt and glow set for yeara and never had this issue, its just this blush and glow set with the highlighter loose from pallet's * Amazing product! The blush and highlighter are so pretty and last on me all day * No shine no pigment i was looking for a cute blush set * The blush is far to pigmented for my preference. It makes me feel like a clown. If you like a lot of pigment this is a great choice though!
I love the highlighter! * Personally I wouldn't buy this again because when you use the blush its either you cant see it at all, or you turn into a literal clown. And the highlighter it's pretty but you gotta apply a few times for it to be actually visible."

It is a pretty color but no sooner did I put it on I had to reaply. I tried putting on several layers of stain and it still didn't work. * why spend $26 when this product will achieve the same look for a fraction of the price? yes, you have to blend it out quick, but i feel like that's expected when you are using a water based tint like this one! i really recommend this product - its one of my staples that i keep in my makeup rotation. i recommend pairing it with lipgloss and also using it as a blush! * This tint really does last awhile! I use a moisturizing lipgloss over it, that may make it wear off faster. I do like this color  A lot! * YOU MUST BLEND IT OUT WITHIN 0.000001 SECONDS OR IT WILL STAIN. i put this on as a blush (dab on both cheeks an on the tip of my nose) and before i could blend it out it created three small circles of color and REFUSED to blend. now it looks like i have a clown nose and it WILL NOT come off with water, miceller cleanser, or miceller wipes. might work as a lip stain but not worth it for me. i love essence so i'll be exchanging it for a powder blush. * I love benetint, and Ive been dieing to try this dupe. Its a 9.5/10 !!!!

The colors are beautiful! The application is a dream and they give just that perfect flush of color! I purchased two shades and showed the line to my friend and she bought one. I do think it is overpriced but, as it should last a long time, I bit the bullet and bought it anyway. As I get older, I have decided become far more intentional in what I buy. The products I chose are generally more high end but, as a I end of with far fewer just tossed in a drawer, I think it is more cost effective in the end. * In love * Pretty color. Does the job. Too expensive. * I have light olive skin and often have difficulty finding colors that aren't too warm or cool. Lychee is perfect! Lasts all day while also managing to look natural. Does not highlight acne texture. The dimethicone in many blushes breaks me out and it's hard to find a product without it these days, happy to find this! It's expensive with the compact, so glad refills are available. * I love this blush. It's a nice buildable formula so it works for a subtle work look and nights out."

It doesn't take much to get the color I want and it goes on smoothy and easily. It's so easy to blend in or wipe off if you put too much on. The color seems very true to how pictured and looks so pretty on. Tinted moisturizer with SPF and the blush are all I need for simple days. If you're on the hunt for new blush, go for IT's cream blush! * I'm very fair and bought the shade sunlit. It is the perfect natural blush shade for, and blends super well. I just tap a dense brush in the pot and tap it out on my cheeks. A very good amount of product as well, I'm sure it'll last me a long time. I do set the cream blush with a powder blush in a similar shade, otherwise I'm not sure how long it would last! * I tried this product curious about how well it goes on.   I was pleased with how easy it goes on.  A little goes a long way.  Looks natural stays on all day * I tried the sun cream color and it is perfect. I look like I got some sun. Very natural. It lasted all day too. A little goes a long way and this jar is going to last me forever! Big fan.
Side note: I have light neutral skin color * I'm so glad I gave this a chance. The packaging is beautiful and the amount per price is actually decent. I bought the warmth shade and may try the sun blossom too. It's like a serum/soft cream texture. Blends easily, great pigmentation. This is my favorite cream blush so far."

Beautiful color, blends easily, and stays on all day, even with my oily skin. Most other blushes, powder or cream, do not stand up against oily skin. And a little goes a long way. Will definitely order more colors. * Velvet Plum was described as a cool berry but had strong brown undertones. Not a berry color at all.
Didn't go on smoothly - very blotchy and hard to blend.
Price is way too high for size of pot.
Not a good value or a good blush - going back. * I've only used it a few times, it's light but buildable coverage., in a pretty pink! * I purchased this in the shade Velvet Plum during a sale and I love it for a monochromatic look. I use it as blush, on my eyelids as a light eyeshadow, and on my lips. It is a bit shiny but I set my face with powder anyways. Love this bc it's a fast way to do my makeup on days I am in a rush and declutters my makeup bag too bc it's multipurpose. Wish I bought more shades during the sale! * doesn't stay on ..too expensive , returning.... * As a dry skin girl, I'm always looking for creamy hydrating products. I absolutely love this blush. It blends well, the color payoff is great, and you can build the color as much as you'd like. A lot of cream blushes fade if you dont apply powder on top, but the staying power on this one is very impressive! No powder needed, you can keep it dewy and the color still lasts all day. Will repurchase. * Doesn't blend well. Product is sticky and shiny."

The color is gorgeous and it adds such a good layer to my makeup! Would definitely recommend for a buildable easy blush! Hard to miss with this one! * Love the color and especially that there is a brush on one side of it. That makes it easy and quick. * Love that it has the brush and blush in one !! * Best blush stick I have ever used! * I have dry skin and I am always reaching for cream products. I bought this in three shades (soft rose, peach caramel, bubblegum) and although the shades are very pigmented upon application, they disappear on my skin within an hour if I don't set them with powder. This takes away from the dewy look I'm trying to achieve with a cream blush. I also find this blush a bit hard to blend and dry, it accentuates any texture on my skin unfortunately. Will return all but the bubblegum, since the color is so sparkly and fun for the summer months :) * I bought this on a whim during Ulta's 21 days of beauty sale and I'm so glad I did! The color (peach caramel) is a gorgeous deep, warm peach color. It looks great on my skin and gives me that flushed look. Like a sunkiss or sunburnt warmth that's all the rage right now. For reference I'm light-medium skin with neutral undertones. I haven't used the brush that comes with it yet but it's incredibly soft and quite dense IMO and will do a great job in a pinch or for a touch up! All in all, I love this product!

Excellent score for this product! Goes on smoothly and provides vibrant color. Gentle on my skin. Quick and easy to apply, and you can control the intensity of the color. Will stay put in colder weather. * I bought this thinking it was a shimmer lip gloss but after opening it, realized it was a liquid blush! I swiped it on my cheeks and used my regular blush brush to blend in and it is really buildable! The color I chose was super light pink but it gives the cutest shimmer and glow of color! The shimmer gives it dimension and it's easy to apply. I love the look you can create with these! I bought another one the next day after my first purchase. * I bought two colors. Blazing and Sizzle City. The color Blazing barely has any pigment. I have fair skin and I was expecting this to show up pink as it looks in the tube. Sizzle City is a little better as the color is pretty, but for the pay off, I don't feel these are worth your money. There are other cheap liquid blushes on the market that are much better than these. * I got this blush in hopes it would be a cheaper dupe for tarte man eater blushss and i was so wrong. This has NO pigment and thats coming from a white person, all that shows up is glitter not shimmer or pearl. It looks awful. And on top of that its patchy to blend out. Overall terrible product no matter how you look at it blush topper, highlighter whatever it just doesn't look good. I got the shade 10 sun tempt. * My overall rating for the Maybelline Sunkisser (blushes) is a 4.5 stars. I would recommend this is you are looking for a super shimmery, affordable, new favorite blush that looks great on natural skin. 

I was honestly surprised to see so many negative reviews for this blush. I picked it up in 2 colors (03 - sol search and 01- downtown rush) and they are my new favorites, it offers a wide range of shades, all of which carry some shimmer! Sol Search blended out into a subtle nude pink, but left a lovely gold shimmer across my cheekbone. Downtown Rush was a super pigmented gorgeous peachy nude that blended right into my skin. I didn't have any issues blending it out (I typically use my fingers and blush brushes). I especially love this blush on a no-foundation look!

Its pillow talk. However, the quality and durability are really disappointing. The product is combined with a highlighter inside, and it cracked after just a few uses. It didn't fall anywhere, I kept it in my cabinet with other cosmetics. * Pillow Talk blush packaging is very pretty and the blush itself coordinates well with the matching lipstick shade. Unfortunately, the blush barely shows up on my skin. Even when I use a heavy hand when applying it, it just looks like I put a ton of highlighter on my cheeks. Poor pigmentation, especially for the price. (For reference, I wear the shade M1 Punjab Nars foundation.) Maybe this will show up well if you have very fair skin. * I llve this blush, unfortunately Ulta could have done better with packaging. Product arrived cracked and made a huge mess when i removed itsm from package. * Ordered Love Glow which is my holy grail. I've worn it daily for a few years. Its a soft yet brightening pink that blends beautifully. The product I recieved came in a box labeled ""Love Glow"" and the label on the compact said ""Love Glow"" but the color itself was NOT Love Glow, it was a light peach with no pigment!

I have this product in two shades depending on the season. * Love the color and light glitter in this makeup * Wanted to love this but it is very patchy. I'll stick with my Milani baked blush. * Love the color and the slight sheen * I'll start by saying I am not usually a blush person. I bought this on a whim because I love bareMinerals products. I was a little nervous that I picked the wrong color; I ordered mauve glow and it's the most pigmented out of them all. For reference, I am a medium skin tone. I brushed it on and the glow was amazing! I swiped once more over the same area to build up the color and it turned out a rosy warm pink, almost like you got some sun. I have to say I'm impressed. I will definitely wear blush more often with this product! * Love this product and have purchased other shades as well"
44,fenty beauty by rihanna,hot cheeks velour blushlighter,pimprod2045516,2625693," * idk why the other reviews are complaining about too much glittler/sparkle when its called blushlighter. its meant to have some sparkle. it's absolutely gorg and just gives such a beautiful glow to your skin. i dont think it brings out a bunch of texture either. i wish it would let me insert a picture so you could see its not overly sparkly, just a pretty glow. you probably dont even need highlighter with this but im extra and always add the fenty diamond bomb. id def reccomend this * really loved fhe packaging and color of the blush but the color does not pick up at all on a brush or beauty blender. you really have to pack it on but it looks streaky after applying so much. milani has a better glowy blush. * I dont understand all the bad reviews. These blushes are gorgeous.  I have Juicy Peach and it is gorgeous on the skin, great color for a pop of peach pink on cheeks!   Yes it has some glitter but not a crazy amount.  I highly recommend! * I have a medium-tan skin tone and I couldn't decide which shade to purchase so I got both Juicy Peach and Baked Peach. They are very similar so you definitely don't need both. Juicy Peach doesn't have a lot of base pigment, it is more like a ""blush topper"", however the glow that it gives the cheeks is stunning, like a peachy/gold reflect. Baked Peach definitely has more of a base color, more like an actual blush. Baked Peach is more pink, the reflect is pink instead of gold. They are both very pretty, depends what look you're going for. I would say even someone with a lighter skin tone could use the darkest shade, as I had to build up to get it to show up (aka not a scary blush) * I love this product for the shimmering glow and rich peach tone! I enjoy the sparkle and it applied easily. I bought the darkest shade. * I got the shade Fresh Peach. It is stunning. Perfect for fair to light skin tones if you want that beautiful light pink flush with gold highlights. When I put it on, it just lights up my face so perfectly with a beautiful glow. I love this and want to get the other colors. Can't get enough. * I wanted to love this so bad because I love the packaging. It looks beautiful in the pan but absolutely no pigment shows up on my face. I bought the lightest shade and tried to build it many times and I ended up really just looking kind of orange with all the gold glitter. Not flattering on my light/medium skin. Going to have to return. :("

This is addictive, it creates the modt glorious blushy glow. Even if i opt for a skin care and minimal concealer day, once i add this, i feel naturally gorgeous and put together. * It is a stunning color. Easy to apply and blends well with the skin. * Barbie Rose Glow is gorgeous!!!! It is very pigmented so only a little is needed. The color looks dramatic in the bottle, but you control how dramatic it looks as you apply it.  The shade is so pretty on. * You do not need a lot of this! It is the perfect glow on mature skin, I have the color soft tulip glow. Plan to buy another shade for a winter pallet! * I love this blush. Its blendable and beautiful and has already eaened a permanent place in my makeup bag. My only complaint is that you really need to be careful how much you use because it is so pigmented. Im guessing between that and the bottle size, this blush will last a looooong time."

Blush has always been my favorite makeup. And I've used it all! The powders, the creams, the gels… but this became my obsession!! So easy to apply, so natural looking as it fully blends in vs sitting on the skin. I've gifted to many friends (and my mom!) because it works for everyone! Love how easy and beautiful it is!! * This blush works with my skins pH to create the best shade of pink on my cheeks! Its super lightweight and easy to blend! Its so fun to watch it changing colors too!! * super pigmented and so natural looking! i actually can't get over how crazy the color changing idea is. i think its based on the chemicals in your skin, but it looks so good with any natural makeup look!! would highly recommend for anyone looking for a blush! * I purchased ""Let's Go Party"" blush due to the shade being like a barbie pink. This gives off a very light flush of pink and I normally add another blush with a similar consistency and add it on top of it for a little more color. * I'm really impressed with the Youthforia Color Changing Blush! It transforms to a perfect shade based on my skin's pH, giving a natural and fresh look. The lightweight formula blends effortlessly and lasts all day. Plus, it's fun to watch the color change! If you're looking for a unique blush that enhances your natural beauty, this is definitely worth a try! * so obsessed with this product, brand, their mission and formulation!! When i first tried this product, i was shocked at the color- i hadnt used a pH blush like this in quite some time.

Applies beautifully, lasts long and has great pigment. My one gripe is that the packaging is not sturdy and twice now the lid has broken off. * VERY PIGMENTED!! A little goes a long way but its also very buildable and very easy to blend. * Nice color, easy to blend, and since I've never used a cream blush before, I find it fun to use. * Love the quality and color.  Added bonus is its price.  I Don't wear this rich of a color much, but it is great for the holiday season! * I like the blush, i enjoy a nice creamy blush but it would only describe it as ""good"" not great. The color doesn't last all day but the worst part is the cheap compact/container it comes in. Ive bought this product 2-3 times and each one has broken at the hinges and the blush tim pops right out. It comes apart before i even get to using half of the product. Fixing this would increase my rating but for now id recommend moving on to more durable products and applicators anywaysz * Thus blush is beautiful, creamy, easy to blend. It's a perfect color for fall looks. A little goes a long way and it is buildable if you want a more pigmented look. Definitely recommend setting it with some sort of powder because it can transfer."
54,l'orÃ©al,lumi le liquid blush,pimprod2045480,2625628," * Absolutely love it. The becca shimmering skin perfector was an obsession of mine years ago. This is very similar but much more pigmented. I love it, it gives a dewy sunkissed glow. My absolute favorite shade is glowy true rose and second to that, glowy gold pink. So beautiful. I recommened swatching in person. Doesnt wear off. * Purchased this because i love the shade 601 for lip products.  

Not the same shade at all, very orangey. * Purchased this because i love the shade 601 for lip products.  

Not the same shade at all, very orangey. * This product is easy to use and colors are beautiful. A little pricey but it's a good product. I have texture on my cheeks and the blush does not make it worse, look great. * These colors will only show up on super-fair skin, so go in knowing that. If you have a darker complexion, every shade shows up as sheer glitter with no differentiation. If you're looking for a liquid highlighter, I guess this can do the job. HOWEVER, if you're looking for a blush that will actually show up on tan-deep complexions, try out the Rare Beauty minis or NYX butter blushes. * This liquid blush is SO pigmented, and most certainly worth the hype it has been getting! A little bit goes a long way and it blends out so so beautifully. * So beautiful. Great pigment and natural finish. Need every shade."
55,chanel,joues contraste powder blush,pimprod2030016,2579895," * The blush doesnt have any pigment ots powdery and the amount of product you get is noth worth the price. * The texture is very soft with finely milled pearl similar to the Hourglass pressed powders. It has a ""lit from within"" look thats not going to emphasize textute. I got it in the color Jersey which is between a rose and warm nutmeg. The blush is a light wash of color that can be built up, but its not designed for vibrancy. Great for those who want a natural blush thats not shimmery or completely matte. I find the color and texture true to luxury makeup. It has longevity, and stays on my skin through an 8 hour work day. 

If youre not into subtle formulas then this isnt for you. There are more vibrant blushes that costs a fraction of the price. If you enjoy luxury makeup or like ultra milled baked powder then this could be an option. * I like this color and texture * I love this !! Its flirty not to bright not to dark it's perfect for those that have olive under tone! * While I wanted to love this blush, I found the coverage was minimal unless I use ALOT of product.  For the price, I won't buy again. * I love this blush! A nice natural glow feels amazing and last a long time. I will definitely buy again * Perfect everyday blush - give perfect amout of pigment and the packaging is very chic :)"
56,revolution beauty,superdewy liquid blush,pimprod2024993,2583413," * Love the color of this liquid blush. * The size of product * So affordable, pigmented and not talked about enough!! I got the hot pink shade, squeeze a tiny amount on the back of yohr hand then stipple brush to even distribute. Super buildable and doesnt get patchy!!! * Returned as unusable. Color was not very pigmented, but more importantly, this formula proved really problematic for my sensitive cheeks. * I thought this would be too bright when I first squeezed it out. Using just a little gives me a nice peachy flush that lasts all day. It's buildable too if I want a bit of a brighter color. * Bought ""Fake the Flush"" because I needed to add something to get to a specific total. Its amazingly beautiful, blends so easily, not super pigmented ( with blushes, in my opinion, there's a thing as too much pigment  ) and less than $2.00, I was not expecting to love it like I do. * This blush did not have great reviews when I bought it and that's why I am here. Honestly, this product is amazing and I don't want people to pass it over. It is blendable, buildable, easy to travel with, plays well with others, and has a beautiful finish. It works well with my sensitive, acne-prone, and combination skin. I love this even more than the elf liquid blush, which tends to be so pigmented that you can overdo your blush easily. However, this blush is very beginner-friendly and you don't run the risk of looking crazy. I think it works best when blended gently with your fingertips. A very small amount goes a long way. Added too much? No biggie, just keep blending with your fingertips. One small drop is enough to cover both cheeks, so this will last you forever. 1st layer gives a 'sheer blush from within' kind of look. You can make it more pigmented with more layers. I will be purchasing more colors and keeping this as my new travel blush. The squeeze tube is about the size of a lip balm and the packaging is cute too. This is very multi-use. You can use it as blush, eyeshadow, or a subtle lip stain. An absolute steal for the price. But the quality is great and this is probably one of the best travel/beginner blushes you will find (regardless of price)."
57,jane iredale,just kissed lip and cheek stain,pimprod2004095,2544987," * As a lip balm it's not moisturizing and doesn't last. As a stain it barely shows (got the pink) and doesn't last. I get more moisture and color from my drugstore stains/balms. You're just paying for the packaging and brand. I don't recommend. * I've used Forever Pink for at least 5 years and bought a new tube recently. The color is not the same, it used to be a beautiful cool pink on me, now it's a warm pink, just not flattering anymore and the sweet smell is a noticeable change too. I'm tremendously upset and disappointed. Please bring back the old version!!! * Love this product, but hate the new white packaging. i love the previoud silver. The white matte color looks cheap, and get dirty fast. * I love this lip stain! It's a beautiful pink color that's unique to me. I love that I can either have it a soft natural pink or make it a darker pink with applying more layers. * Perfect lip gloss stays a long time as well. * I got this on sale during one of Ulta's big sales as couldn't see paying the price otherwise. The red actually looks orange...and has little color pay off but is the most emollient, long lasting, comforting and delicious smelling lipgloss I have ever owned. Please come out with more colors! Brown, purple, pink would be fabulous. * Thanks ulta 20 days of beauty that allowed me to purchase this for the low to end up loving it. Its my favorite item to complete my new make up make up look."
58,hourglass,ambient lighting blush,pimprod2020426,2575935," * I didn't understand the hype or the price point till I tried it myself. It's just so smooth and buttery and gives a beautiful finish on the cheeks * I've had this blush in diffused heat for years - it is my go-to. Looks a little dewy and very natural, easy to blend and wear, it also lasts a long time. I recently purchased At Night and it goes on much patchier, never had that issue with the other color. But it blends out ok. These are pretty pigmented IMO, but then I don't wear super heavy blush. It's good for someone who wants something more natural looking. A little pricy. * Terrible product with zero color payoff * I never tried this brand before but this product in Ethereal Glow is perfect. It's lightweight which is perfect in spring/summer but can be used in fall/winter to get rid of pale skin.  I don't need to use much. I highly recommend based on skin color. I'm a pale white girl and loved the color. * I decided to invest in a good blush that is high quality and wont break me out because I have acne prone skin. I love how it looks and it has a little shimmer. * Based on the reviews and price, I wanted to absolute fall in love with this blush. Using it alone, it was patchy by the end of the day. You have to use it as a setting blush on top of cream if you want to it hold. Not to mention, the packaging feels so cheap. Some of my drugstore makeup has better eye appeal and structure compared to this. It also comes with a disclosure to be careful, because it's delicate… Hmm I wonder why lol * I have 4 shades of this blush plus a couple of the holiday palettes, and it is my favorite blush formula of all time. You don't need to add highlighter when you use this. Depending on the shade, bronzer is also optional. You get a lot of product for the price, and there is no talc. It's almost impossible to overdo this blush as it is not super pigmented but still you don't need much to get the job done. There is no fragrance. It's just a well made beautiful product. Packaging is also super sturdy. It lasts all day even in hot humid weather and never looks dry or powdery or glittery. You just get a perfect lit from within glow. Everyone should try this at least once. I have repurchased a few of the shades at least a couple of times. Hourglass does powder products extremely well."

Great price point! * this came as a free gift with other ulta beauty collection items and it has become my favorite, everyday blush.  blends easily, lasts my whole shift, and gives a stunning glow that doesn't accentuate texture or feel heavy on the skin. * Love it!

62,colourpop,pokÃ©mon x colourpop instant crush cream blush,pimprod2045285,2624663," * I just ordered another Electroball Colourpop Pokémon blush because it is the most perfect flush of believable sheer color. I apply it with a dry sponge that has a rounded but somewhat flat bottom so my fingers dont get stained. This summer I'm all about the hot pink coral lips and cheeks because it imparts a vibrant and lively look to the face and I can keep the eye look simple with just liner, mascara and a neutral eyeshadow from lid to brow or none at all. There used to be a MAC cream color base called Virgin Isle and I love Electroball way more than that. I ordered the violet one this time around and hopefully it'll look just as fabulous. I'm also going to try it as an eyeshadow and see if it makes my brown eyes pop. * My NB son, 15, wanted to do his face (first time) to go to drag show and loves Pokémon. He's a perfect match to the palest Morphe foundation. I was afraid the cherry red Pikachu blush would be too intense, but it imparted the loveliest cherry red flush and I built it up till it was just amazing.  Now I want my own, his cousin teased that she was going to steal all his Pokémon makeup after seeing how beautiful it looked on. * I got the light pink blush. It is so oily and completely sheer. Trying to rub it into the skin is like rubbing lip balm. 

Tower 28 cream blush is so much more pigmented and not oily. I have no idea why all the products from this launch are so bad, but they are. * I got all three and it seems like its a cream to powder matte finish. They are all sheer and very builable.  I would use a smaller blush brush to get color pay off. Very pretty and natural on the skin. * I bought the shade electro ball and its gorgeous! It blends out super easily and the color lasts all day with no issues. It's a great cream blush."

It blends beautifully with a beauty blender. The color is sheer but buildable. I plan on purchasing again soon. I have never loved a blush enough to buy it more than once and I usually don't finish a blush before it expires. The formula feels a bit heavy before it's blended out, but after it's blended, it feels like nothing on the skin. I definitely recommend this. 

My complexion is very light. This probably wouldn't work well as a blush on someone with a deeper complexion. It would be pretty as a highlighter on a deeper complexion. * I love this, its easy to blend, nice color, and smooth to apply. But i only widh it kasted longer though, but when i use setting soray it kidna lasts longer. But its beautiful! * First time I've used a cream blush and honestly didn't think I'd like it as I didn't think it would blend nicely. Got it as a sample with another purchase so gave it a try. I LOVE IT.  Blends easily, the color is very pigmented so a little goes a long way, and lasts all day. I think I'll try it as eye color as well. I have the Sparking Rose, I am a fairly fair skinned redhead and this shade compliments my skin and hair beautifully. Will definitely purchase again. * Perfect to keep in your purse for touchups, stays on , also good color choices"

It appears the consistency or formula is different. The lighter bronzer shade was a lot cooler, and was a lot easier to blend out. This looks muddy. But the pink highlight is my asbolute favorite. I wish they sold just the highlight shade by itself.. * This palette is great for everyday! It blends great and lasts forever. * This is my favorite face palette!! I'm obsessed with it I've used it for years I always repurchase. The bronzers and blushes blend so nicely, and all the colors go perfect with my skin tone. I will say I'm not super pale and fair skinned though, to me this is more for medium tan girlies * I love this pallet. I have been looking at this for awhile now and wasn't sure which color to order but I'm glad I went with this one. I think the others would have been too dark. The contour is slightly darker but I can easily use one of the lighter bronzers for contouring. * I found this to be too warm to use for bronzers/ contour. looks very orange and yellow. the blush and highlight are okay though. * Beautiful"

I have goofy combo skin and some fine lines-this blush goes on so nicely and it doesn't make my face look more oily in my t zone and it does not settle into drier skin and lines! Absolutely worth the price and I hope they never stop making this blush! * I love this and the color but it used to have spf in it. Now it's just a regular blush. I noticed the brand has been doing away with the products being spf. Which is a shame since that's the reason I stocked up in early spring. Now since it has no spf, I am in no hurry to purchase. I still miss there spf gloss that used to be this color. * I've been using this blush for over a year now and I love this stuff!  I have dry, flaky skin and using powder blush accentuates my dry spots. This blush gives me a beautiful glow with some added moisture.  Long lasting and beautiful! I really think this blush would be good for all skin types especially dryer skin, a little goes a long way! * I love this blush in the summer when I need a bit of a boost on my cheeks for going out after doing some sun loving activities. I have sensitive skin, so when working outdoors I can only have sunscreen. Due to the sunscreen in the blush this helps being able to put some neutral makeup on for work without the risk of my face getting sunburned with regular makeup. I love the neutral color. Perricone MD used to sell an spf lipgloss in this color as well, I wish they brought back the lipgloss as it smelled great and worked fantastically. * CONS 
1. This blush burnt my skin. 
I applied the blush almost daily for several months. 2 weeks ago the skin on my cheek bones where the blush touched (in the exact shape I apply my blush) got a terrible allergic reaction: painful, red, extremely dry and bumpy. It has been several days of using soothing skincare, and the irritation is still there, although very slowly subsiding. 
2. As other reviewershave mentioned, the cap cracks easily when you screw the top closed. 

PROS 
The shade is buildable and starts very subtle. I have light skin, cool undertone, and this blush looked beautiful. * i only used this once or twice. i screwed the cap on too tight one time and the lid breaks and the stopper sank to the bottom. please replace the cheap plastic with metal. * I love the color of this blush and it blends beautifully. Big drawback though is the packaging. The lid completely cracked when I tightened it. I love this blush but now I can't take it anywhere. Please fix this packaging!!!!!"
66,bareminerals,loose mineral blush,pimprod2034497,2599467," * I finally found the perfect blush. I have tried everything - cream, liquid, powder. THIS is by far and wide the best blush I've ever used. For reference, my skin tone is fair with neutral undertones. I have combination skin that leans more toward dry and I'm in my 30s. I bought the Vintage Peach and it literally gives me the PERFECT glow (no exaggeration here). I'm really picky with my makeup because with my skin type it's hard to find stuff that actually works, looks good, and stays working and looking good. This blush is a teensy bit glittery but honestly it's not very noticeable on the skin and it doesn't bother me at all, if anything it really helps give you that nice glow I mentioned. It being a powder, I was concerned at first with my skin type, but honestly it blends in so well it's like it's a part of my skin. I love it. I'm sticking to this, and although the packaging is small (be prepared), a little goes a REALLY long way so I know i'll get my money's worth. * I should have read more into the ""shimmering"" aspect of this product before I bought it. I was happy to find a clean blush with a beautiful color but the sparkles are too much. Will be returning. * Really like it! * I have used these little shimmery colored powders for years.  You can add them to your setting powder or use as an added effect after you're all done putting on your makeup. Really gives life to an older complex 
 ion! * I love the Bare Minerals foudnation and faux tan. The blush is pretty but… I have acne scars and the glitter excentuates these scars dramatically. It just doesnt look smooth. The color doesnt last either. I notice that it is gone within minutes of applying. Honestly I will stick with some of my drug store options. * I love the loose blush. I have been using it for years but miss the glee color. It was very popular because i always had a hard time finding it in stock. Why did you discontinue? * I first purchased this 10 years ago and have been consistently repurchasing ever since. Im fair skinned with neutral undertones, and the vintage peach shade is the perfect sunkissed glow on me. I've tried a TON of blushes, from drugstore to high end, and this is the one that is my baseline every day blush. As someone who's very fair, I love that this is buildable for when I want a more vibrant look. 10/10"

I rarely find a power face product that I can use in the winter without feeling chalky * I love these blushes but I recently found out they have almond butter in them and I'm allergic to almonds. I haven't had a bad reaction but I'm scared to continue using. I hope NYX releases more blushes with nut free ingredients for people with nut allergies. * This smells so good that I want to eat it! It blends amazingly and is so pretty. * It was long lasting, which is great. I grabbed this for a trial run for my makeup and where it didn't work for me. The color eas entirely too bright for my caramel skin color. * I bought My Butta Half and All the Butta and the colors are beautiful and blend like a dream! They can be subtle if you use a light hand or you can easily build them up~ The colors I got are nice cool/neutral tones and All the Butta was my first purple blush and it was the perfect shade for a flushed berry/mod purple look. 
If you want something not so pigmented I would steer away from this though. * it smells so good and the formula is soft and really pigmented. it has a highlighter like finish and i found it really easy to blend out, the colors are so pretty and overall i would highly recommend!! * Its wayy darker than the image and not at all matte.

The highlighter just makes my face look greasy, and the blush wears off as soon as i put it on even with a setting spray. The only good thing is the bronzer. I wanted to like this product but unfortunately it's a no for me. I would rather spend more money and get products that do what they are supposed to. * The product itself is just ok. Nothing special. Ulta had to resend a new one becauae my first one came broken. The bronzer was broken off the bottom. It didn't last long on me at all and after a couple hours I broke out in a painful rash on both cheeks. * The creamy texture is great for my combination skin and it leaves such an natural, glowy finish. It lasts all day and ive recieved so many compliments. I have both colorways of this product and wish they made atleast the bronzer separately because I use the darker bronzer with the lighter blush. If this line was a customizable stack it would be my favorite line of products of all time. * This is beautiful. I got the darker one and all colors are beautiful. Great for makeup bag to cut down on space. Love this!"

I'm hoping it will look great during the summer when I have more color as I chose the cherry shade which is absolutely gorgeous. * I love this blush! I use it over my YSL liquid blush abd the combo is unreal. Please bring back the lavender shade! It's sooo pretty! * This blush is great on top of a liquid or cream blush. * not very pigmented. I bought this bc it was used at my wedding and I loved it. The one I gave is not pigmented at all, maybe I got a bad batch? * I love this blush! It goes on perfectly with just a simple blush brush. It is light and non-greasy, and always looks fabulous! I use it to add a pink glow wherever I want it. * The package came perfect, and the color is so pretty * This color is so flattering and i will say i try to stay away from blush becuse i tend to have a heavy hand and then I get frustrated having to remove it and start over etc. 
People are giving this bad reviews for lack of pigment. I personally love a natural look, and this blush will allow you to achieve that but also is very buildable if you do want a more pigmented cheek. I have never been so impressed by a blush before. I was very scared I was going to hate it but im so glad I gave it a shot! The color is so flattering on me while pale and tan!"

I have very fair skin, and this creates a healthy pink flush rather than advertising fake paint on my face. Love it! * I am not a blush person so it was with caution that I purchased this. I now have 4. To be clear, I like the blush to look like its coming from my actual skin, underneath. I also found the Bobbi Brown blush brush to create this look perfectly while depositing color well. I have had no skin irritation and have early mature dry-combination skin. It stays on all day too. * Dior blush lasts 3 times as long as my Nars blush. The little extra you spend initially is worth it. You won't need a replacement for a long time. It also won't break up on you when it gets low. Nars does that to me almost every time. I love this product. It actually saves you money and the colors are beautiful. Now lets hope they don't get greedy, change the formula and mess it up. * I have the newer formulation in ""Nude Look"", and I love it.  I love how buildable it is.  For no makeup, makeup days it's great because you can make it be more natural looking.  I read a bad review on this page and said it was patchy?  It's not patchy on me at all.  Maybe because of different make-up prep?  I love this blush and definitely would recommend.  Yes, it is pricey, but if you want to splurge on a good blush…. This would be a great option. * I hate blushes that are so pigmented or just don't blend well meaning they aren't natural but this is so cute! Sometimes when I want like a sunburnt look its super natural & when I put it on everyday its super lightweight and it doesnt smudge. People can say it has no pigment but me personally I love it because I swatched their little brush twice and I got enough pigment. * I hate blushes that are so pigmented or just don't blend well meaning they aren't natural but this is so cute!

75,tarte,maneater blush & glow cheek plump,pimprod2028223,2586348," * I have been on the ""match your lips to your cheeks"" trend since before it became popular. I do this by simply using the blush as normal on my cheeks and then dabbing some on the center of my lips for a natural tint. I have never had a problem with this before and, as you can imagine, this is not a new concept to me. I used this blush for the first time yesterday and my cheeks looked like absolute perfection! That is the ONLY reason this is not getting a one star. When I applied it to my lips, I noticed that it burned, which was something that definitely doesn't happen when applied to cheeks. I remembered it was a plumping blush so I put it out of mind. It is 24 hours later and the pain is horrible. I am worried that in some way it has caused a chemical burn (something that isn't new to me as I work in a lab). I'm attaching a picture as of this morning with no makeup for reference. I beg you, PLEASE hear this story when you are considering buying this blush. * I got this as a sample and ended up buying a full size product. I love how this blends for me. It stays throughout the day and doesn't run or rub off. Easy to take off with makeup remover and just overall good feel. I will definitely be purchasing again. * This blush is amazing. You csn keep it sheer or build up the color. It is a beautiful color in pink. I thought i could get a similar product. No nothing compares. 
There is a slight fragrnce to it but nothing too bad. 
Will buy again and again. * Am always looking for subtle, nondrying color as part of my everyday minimum - tinted moisturizer, blush, mascara. This is my new fave. Simple application, subtle color and glow. I'm not sure about the plumping factor but it seems to photograph well. * I REALLY wanted to love this product. the color is beautiful and I was so excited about the plumping feature. Unfortunately this blush is just not pigmented enough. When I blend it it basically completely disappears. When compared to other blushes out there this just does not measure up :/. I'm disappointed but I did a side by side of this blush and another blush on a swatch test and it was CRAZY how this blush basically disappeared while the other one perfectly blended. not worth it sadly. * very few things make it to my holy grain list but this is on it.

layered over other blush for more dimension or alone for a sheer wash its perfection. 

doesnt settle in lines, blends beautifully with fingers, sponge or brush and totally ""goof proof"". just enough glow with out looking fake. last all day with a good setting spray.

i think Im on my 6th or so bottle/container * I bought this blush last year and all i can say is im obsessed with it!!! This is my favorite blush and nothing can compare. You omly have to use one dot and it shows up beautiful afted you blend it. My cheeks when i use this blush are so pretty and glowy. This was my first liquid blush i have ever used so i was a bit skeptical but i fell in love so quick and i can never find nothing like it. If you arw considering to buy it please do especially you love feeling beautiful and glowy. Im serious i never leave comments or reviews but this blush has change my makeup game 😍😍😍"

These are beautiful everyday shades that work with any eye look that I do.  I love the natural sheen in these blushes, but they arent glittery or emphasize texture.  One of my favs!! * Purchased the shade nude venus and all i can say is wow. So creamy, buttery, pigmented!!! Looks beautiful on the skin. Blends into the skin, doesnt leave any patches or streakes. Truly a really nice blush, its worth every penny! * amazing blush!! has lots of fall out but sits beautifully on the skin and has such a great formula would recommend trying this (: * I have a hard time finding a blush due to being pale and not loving pink on myself, but i love this color and product overall. Never thought I would ever be one to wear blush. * I own 3 different colors and am in love with every shade. The finish is a beautiful skin like satin, tons of lovely shades that work on all skintones, stunning packaging, wtc * I got the Fleurtasious (sp) it is a beautiful beige pink and i have fair skin and it blends beautifully. * The prettiest blush for every skin tone. A bit pricey but you do get a bit more product than you would with other highend blush at this price point.  Also, a little goes a long way because the pigment is definitely there and the texture and application is so smooth. Love this blush (shade cherish)"

Looking for something comparable like this for years. * I love the dewy look it provides hence the name. I personally prefer a natural look so this definitely fit my preferences with not looking that heavy. Application is smooth and convenient packaging * I did not like.  It did not last very long on my skin.  The color faded quickly. * This nudie bloom blush is gorgeous on the cheeks!  It's my second time buying this.  It glides on seamlessly and gives a beautiful flush of color * I didn't know much about Nudestix before ordering this. That being said, I love these blush sticks. Sweet Cheeks is just enough pink to be noticeable while still giving a natural look. Love the brush applicator on the other side as well! * Cherry Blossom baby color is great spring/summer color for my skin tone. Surprised how long lasting it is. Got it on sale and best money ever spent * I love it"
78,kvd beauty,good apple blush balm duo,pimprod2043903,2621127," * I really wanted to like this blush as I have been on tje lookout for a highly pigmented cream blush. Unfortunately, i was disapointed by the KVD blush balm duo's performance and don't believe it is worth the expensive price point. 

This product is not nearly as blendable as i would typically prefer my cream products to be. It sort of has a cream-to-powder feel due to how quickly the product dries / mattifies during application. I have to really work to get any kind of transition of color because the pigmentation is so strong, and it is incredibly hard to blend with or on top of other products without triggering the following issue; product settling into the pores and accentuates the skins natural texture as opposed to any kind of blurring effect. Incredibly difficult to blend as a result, and despite my best efforts, maybe 75% of the time it creates the appearance of strawberry skin on a previously flawless base due to how the product settles on the face :/ overall, i would not say that this KVD blush balm duo was worth the cost nor could I recommend its formula to anyone who migbt be interested in a blush balm * Ohmygod im gonna BUST. This blush is the best purple blush ever made. * Very pigmented, but also very bendable. Layers well over liquid foundation, or under powder for a less intense look. A bit of a learning curve at first but very worth it imo. * doesn't blend as well as other brands. color pay off is fine for an hour or two and then completely disappears. will not repurchase. * This blush is amazing! Let me start by saying I work 12 hour night shift and some nights I'm very physically active, leaving me with patchy/streaked or zero face makeup at the end of my shift. I live in the South and our air conditioning went out at work on a 93° day. The thermostat read 79° at it's lowest indoor temp that day and after a very sweaty 12 hours of work, this blush was still holding strong! The pigment is pigment-ing (seriously the most color rich blush I've ever used) and a little goes a very long way but it's creamy and still easy to blend out. The balm like consistency is great for dry skin, doesn't settle into creases, lasts forever. Definitely my new favorite blush * Im so happy kvd 💋 I loved its amazing shade and very pigmented stays all day * I was really excited to try these colors since theyre so unique. The red is absolutely stunning, but the purple ends up not being purple once its blended out, and turns more of a fuschia/dark hot pink color. Ive been on the hunt for a purple blush for awhile so i waa bummed to find that this isnt quite it. However, I really love the red as an alternative toned blush. It looks great on my more olive toned skin!"
79,pur,silky tint creamy multitasking stick,pimprod2044097,2620462," * I rated this highlighter a 3 out of 5. I will definitely continue to use because I've been wanting to switch to more of a liquid highlighter versus powder. A little goes a long way with this product and I like the glowy shimmer of the finished look. Only thing is I feel like I didn't really notice the glow/shimmer much when I tried to capture a picture of the finished look (hence no picture of the finished look). I like that this could also be a lipstick but again, a little goes a long way on the lips. Can definitely be paired with lip liner and lip gloss. I would purchase this product again. * I love how simple the packaging I. I also enjoy how multi use it can be. It is great to use as a blush as well as a lip stick. It adds a great pop of color to any look that I want to create. It does not have a strong scent. The texture is smooth like a balm. * The Pur you go pearl multitasking stick is beautiful! The packaging makes it super easy to dispense the product and convenient to take on the go. The pearly color worked really well for my olive undertones. 

I use two methods for application, the first just my hands - I'll warm the product up on the back of my hand then apply using my fingers to the high points of my cheeks and nose. The second - If I want to get a more precise application I'll pick up the product up with a brush and apply to the inner corner of my eyes and brow bone. 

The product wears well and layers well both under and over powder. I'm interested to try the more pinky shade now! Highly recommend this! * I really love this multi stick from Pur! I got the shade You Go Pearl which is a super nice champagne cream highlight. It blends super beautifully and doesn't look cakey. * I love cream blushes, and was excited to i
Imitry this one,  cute packaging, it's very creamy, easy to blend, but it's not very pigmented, the color payoff was not noticeable on my dark complexion. * This cream stick is the perfect addition to my makeup case. I like that I can use it for my cheeks and my lips, as it minimizes the need for other products, and as a redhead, it looks good on both. The texture is so creamy and blends perfectly with a finger or a brush. It's light, so you won't be overpowered with color. Definitely buying another when I run out! * The PUR Silky Tint Creamy Multitasking Stick is a game-changer! Sleek packaging, no scent (perfect for sensitive noses), creamy texture, blends like a dream, and leaves a silky, radiant finish. A must-have for effortless, natural beauty! Would buy again and again!"

I can put it on & go or put it on with my full face of makeup & it just looks beautiful. You can even have already put on your setting piwder & it still goes on with ease & no clumping just glides on perdectly. This is my new favorite blush. It gives you just an amazing beautiful color that looks so natural. I LOVE it!!! Buy it! * I love all the complexion rescue products, after my dermatologist recommended it! I apply it with a brush and blend away for a beautiful glowing complexion * This had a great brightener that was soft and warm. It gave a healthy glow without trying too hard to be a deep dark tropical tan. * Gorgeous healthy glow! I loved this blush however none of the colors worked for me they turned too orange on my light warm skin tone 😔 * Omg this bronzer and blush together is so glowy on the skin, especially if you put a little bit on it cheeks where the sun will hit them it just looks so pretty and sun kissed. It has such an amazing glow that is perfect for summer! * Great color - I am warm/olive tone (light-medium in the winter, medium-tan in the summer)… I bought Kiss of Rose and it is perfect for me.

The reviews here weren't really convincing me either because they seem pretty low. This adds such a beautiful finishing touch! Just a beautiful natural glow, very different from my highlighters! I am thrilled I took a chance and purchased it. * I'm fair and prefer subtle color, so this is perfect for me. I use the first shade over my T-zone, middle shade as my highlight, and the last shade as a light bronzer. I love that the shimmer in it is so finely milled it doesn't look like glitter, just a natural glow * I blend all 3 together to provide a natural dewy glow. Love the effects. And can use individually as well. * Goes on beautifully and stays put in my humid weather here in florida.  Love the 3 highlight colors. * Ive used this  since 2016 and i dont think it will ever leave my daily makeup bag. It makes my skin look smooth, glowy and natural. Its talc free so it doesn't settle into fine lines. Im fair so i use the colors individually to set, highlight and bronze. Theyre also beautiful as eyeshadow. Because they're baked, they also last forever. With daily use, i hit pan every year or so. * Stunning glow. Not shiny or sparkly, subtle and beautiful. I sometimes swatch by single color and sometimes just swipe my brush across all 3, then sit back and wait for compliments. Great for understated am glow too. Lost a star bc price prohibitive. Should be an everyday glow product but isn't for me bc of the price. * I'm on the fence with this product. I really wanted to love it. I have to use full coverage foundation due to hyperpigmentation and dark spots. So when I used this, I used it instead of my setting powder/pressed powder. Didn't really like the way it looked on me. Maybe I'll try using my setting powder first then this. If that doesn't work, then I'm probably going to return it. It's nice but it's not WOW factor."

I'm more on the fair side and this looks beautiful on my skin. I use it with a brush and applies perfectly * Love this product!! So easy to blend out and isn't too pigmented of a blush. Perfect for an everyday look if you're looking for a quick blush! * I was looking for a plum blush and this product is so easy to apply and the color is such a natural look. Do know, the product packaging is cheap. But the product is sublime it looks natural yet adds that enhancement, and there is a slight glow to it. I have found other blushes are really heavy. This one is definitely buildable.  This can go from a day to evening look very easily and the price point I think is good given the amount of product you get and the look that you get when using it."

The case is cute and works great and the product lasts a long time even with daily use! * Love this hybrid gel cheek duo * I purchased the Grapefruit and Caramel color. I tried it out with my fingers and a brush.

The good;
-Pretty colors. They swatch mat but do blend out sheer and become part of the skin. 
-Elegant formulation with a creamy and light feel on the skin. 
-Easy to use, compact and portable.
-No discernable scent. 
-Neither the bronzer nor the blush have any glowy particles. 

The not so good;
-I am fair but cool toned and ALL the colors are warm on me. Why Stila, why? 
-Once applied the blush and bronzer become sheer and the colors disappear as they blend in. 
-I had to do multiple layers before I could truly see any color payoff.
I am tempted to purchase a darker color combination just so it would show up. 

Overall this is a clever, very convenient, and  portable product. Perhaps great for on the go touchups. But it is so sheer and blends out on my skin so much that there is virtually nothing left. * I really like this Stilla Blush & Bronze Hydro-Blur cheek duo. It blebds well and looks so natural. Its not sticky or tacky at all. It doesnt turn orange color either.  Doesnt look fake. * Based on the photos, I'd have shied away from the intense shades but they really sheer out on my light olive skin so I'm so glad I saw them in person because I would've ended up picking a lighter shade (and I might do that, too). Loving the Guava! It is lasting longer than powder blush (even with a setting spray) and is super convenient to throw into my bag for on the go touch ups. I even dabbed some of the bronzer side on in my crease when I was out and my eyeshadow needed a little pick me up. SOLD!!!"

I lucked out and got it for a pretty reasonable price, however, I've already purchased 2 additional shades lol.

I have super sensitive skin and this has no talc! Yay! * I was so glad that Bobbi Brown removed the lanolin from their blushes, but disappointed to see that they now contain coconut oil, which is pore clogging.  I know Bobbi Brown has dry skin, and I feel like all her products are made with dry skinned people in mind, but do not work well for people with oily or acne prone skin.  It's too bad, because I have had back luck with several of her products (her tinted moisturizer contains petrolatum, and clogged my pores).  Please make products that anyone can use! * I bought Desert Pink. It is a darker medium pink. The size was small and packaging seemed cheap. Would be good in a makeup kit because it's small, no bulk, and has a window to show color. It's buildable but the price is too much for what you get. When you pay this much for blush you expect a bit more. Pretty but the size and price are cons for me."

I use the morphe fan brush to apply and the rose colored highlighter brush to blend and it blends the highlighter and bronzer perfectly. Since I moved this product isn't sold in store so I had to order...that's the only thing that I don't like is that it's not sold in MN Ulta stores. * This palette is exactly what I was looking for, the colors are very pigmented, but it is a little hard to blend out well. The colors are fantastic; it has contour, blush, highlighter. Also, I use them as eye shadow. * This palette is horrible! The contour and highlighter do not blend easily at all. The highlighter has very chunky glitter. If I could give it no stars I would. * The blushes in this palette are soo pretty. The bronzers are warm and beautiful as well. Perfect for your kit. * This product is goood!!! I'm an MUA... and it's good for women of color * I have been looking for a bronzer for my deep complexion and wanted to try out a few shades before committing. This palette lets me do that.

It's timeless and beautiful and makes you glow. * There is no pigment at all in the new formula. I have used this blush for 10 years, and now it is absolutely unusable. * Thought it was just me but reading the comments I see I'm not alone.  Long time iser of Orgasm and the new formula is awful.  Color is basically gone and does not last. * Does not show up. At all. Too glittery * The new formula is a different color and now its half the size as the old one?!?

92,anastasia beverly hills,"face palette - all in one bronzer, highlight, blush",pimprod2024358,2576830," * I bought this for traveling and was pleasantly surprised.  The bronzer is way more pigmented than expected-a little goes a long way.  Blush too but the overall end color is fab.  Highly recommend for a medium skin tone! * It's really hard to find warm leaning products that aren't too deep, but I found Italian summer is super flattering on my complexion. If you lean cool, this palette might not be the right one for you as it's very gold-based in person, more so than the online pictures. I dropped one star because there is glitter in the blush+highlighter. It blends in pretty well but would prefer more of a natural shimmer. Overall a great three in one palette for a minimalist like me. * Although my skin tone is on the lighter side, I opted for the Costa Rica palette because I preferred the blush color. The bronzer is thankfully not too dark for me and blends nicely. I'm not a fan of the highlighter color, though. It's way too bronzed. I have the ABH highlighter palette so I just use that, but I was trying to find an all-in-one face palette. I likely won't repurchase, but it is an ok palette if you like all the colors. * I love this palette. I have pale skin, so I bought Italian summer. Great pigments and great packaging. * You need this it's truly REMARKABLE ITS SO NICE MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR COLOR THOU.This will get you many to ask what you're wearing and where you get it.  The inside and out it's truly worth all the coins. I just hope it last so I'm able to get a medium one too. This is my go to and will be for a long time. Loving this. * The blush and bronzer are pretty, but the highlight is so powdery, it has not shine at all. Thinking about returning. * It's beyond a different shade in person then here. Beyond disappointed since most store aren't taking exchanges :("

The packaging is lovely and it fits in my purse. It's fab! * First off, I really love this formula. It's highly pigmented and blends easily into the skin. However, the packaging has some issues. There is a lot of product buildup around the rim that I have to wipe off with a tissue every second or third time I use this blush. It's just disappointing to lose that much product especially since I really like it. * Great liquid blush. Love the bottle and applicator. Nice color and blends well. I just have to remind myself to go easy because a little goes a long way * very pigmented and comes in many pretty shades. the packaging is super cute, it looks like a rose! the applicator is unique and easy to use. would definitely buy again! * I bought this on a lark, because Benefit Cosmetics' Benetint just doesn't cut it for me anymore. This blush is FAR better for my coloring and for applying. * I like it but, I don't use it evry day and in 2 months the applicator sponge came off .... no longer useful."

Blurring effect is real. * I have five different colors of this blush because I love it so much. I sometimes do some mixing of two shades for a custom look. Been wearing blush for decades, used so many brands but this is the perfect formula for me. Love the texture, depth of color and staying power plus it smells delicious. The compact is a nice size and super attractive. I'm 62, still have oily skin, light-medium olive with yellow tones. If Too Faced ever discontinues this blush, I will be so upset! * First off these are very small , rediculously small . Probably the smallest blush ive ever purchased at this price .They smell like candy , the pigmentation is insane and it builds up well . Just didnt expect it to be the size of a pendant . * Inwould not recommend this blue. 
The pigmentation sucks and it takes ALOT just for it to just start showing on my cheeks. 

Also, the smell of this blush… I HATE IT! 
I think I hate the smell of it more than anything else. * Love this blush, smells sooo good. It looks really nice but it doesnt match the photo, the shade is off"

I did not break out from this blush. * I ordered this small size to try and I love it! I have finally found a blush that I love and looks perfect on me. When I am done with this mini, I will order the larger, regular size compact. Sometimes I like to take my brush and get all 3 colors on it and use it like that and it gives a pretty glow to the look. It stays put all day and I recommend it! 5 stars! ⭐️ * I absolutely adore this product and it's versatility. It's my go-to travel blush. I pair it with Rare Beauty 'Hope' liquid blush or wear it on its own.  I love that it has three shades to create a custom look on my cheeks, but when I need to move fast, I use all of them all at once for a pretty soft glow blush.  I view its small size as a complete bonus.  It's absolutely perfect. * I love this color! I had been wearing the color mocha from Chanel for years and years and out of nowhere they discontinued it and nobody knew why because it was such a unique color then I switched to our oasis also discontinued so I found this and I feel like it's very similar I'm just wondering if it's going to stay on and where as well as the other two did! I really hope this doesn't get discontinued. I'm gonna buy a few more and I wish it came in a larger size. I do not feel like the her eyeshadows wewr well even w primer so im crossing my fingers that the blush stays on better! * As a ND collector this one was a miss for me, although the mini pallet in this series was great. This pulled really orange on my fair cool pink undertone. I also found the size of it impractical for having 2 blushes and a highlighter in it. I knew it was mini and that wasn't the issue, I just think it could/should have been JUST blush and it would have been great. But that highlight mixed in wasn't it for me. * I was hoping for a cool toned blush, but this ended up being more of a soft warm clay color on me than the more pinky mauve it appears to be. It wasn't working for me. The highlighter was cute, but I didn't think that or the blush had the best staying power considering the price. They aren't that bad, but just not my style, so I returned this item. The mini eyeshadow palette is a keeper, though! * If you want a pretty blush with a sheen, this is a good option. Just be aware, if you want that pinker tone (esp for us paler types) this isn't that. It's more of a rusty red tone, with a light gold highlight."

I prefer these over the Ciele Liquid SPF50 blushes for everyday. The finish reminds me of the Original Benefit Benetint with the translucent wash of color that still allows you to see the skin underneath. Love that they have broad spectrum sun protection since the cheekbone area is exposed to a lot of sun and prone to hyperpigmentation. In the pic Sunny sweet cheeks is the top blush shade and strawberry sunburst is the 4th. Ciele Kirsten and Elodie are 2nd and 3rd from the top. * So i bought this blush when  it first came ouy and fell in love with it, all of a sudden it gave the worst and most painful  allergic reaction, has this happened to anyone else? * I love this is an spf blush!

I got this instead and I like it so much more. Its not too warm, just right. Im extremely fussy about blush shades and this is the perfect pink. I dont have to build up the color at all like you have to with the dragon palette. It just looks good on the first go. My makeup is taking less time in the morning since everything is in one palette. Use a light hand with the highlighter as its very shiny/pigmented. * if you are a beginner in makeup, this would be perfect for you, the options r amazing and you can really experiment * I really want to gatekeep this product but its just too good i love it so much and it smells amazing i love the pigment and the formula * Its meant for white skin. The onlt thing that look slightly okay on me was the glowy blush. It was also quite patchy. Sad bc i really like physian formula * Surprising buildable coverage and the shades aren't as deep as I thought they would be. I definitely do NOT recommend this for anyone with medium + skin, as the bronzers wouldn't work, so it wouldn't be an effective use of money :/. Otherwise, it's gorgeous and I'm really excited to use it. * Im obsessed.  Love this product, buildable but also pigmented.

Great for combo or oily skin types! * I got this blush in the shade Paris and its is a beautiful blush. However, I'm not sure if this happens to everyone, but for me the blush keeps falling out from the container and I've never had it upside down, I've never dropped it, so I dont know whats causing this. * SO easy to use, I love the packaging, & that I can carry it around in my purse to re-apply (although I didn't have to because it lasted all night!), and it blended in so nicely. Highly recommended for those that are on the go and want a flawless look * If you are expecting this to be anything othet than a powder blush i think you will be disappointed. It is a good blush. However If you are expecting it to be as blendable as a cream, as it claims, its not. I was worried the first time i tried to blend it because Its harder to blend out than my cream blushes.

This blush was a very cute shade and had an amazing smell but it was impossible to blend and the only real purpose I had for it was to smear it on my cheeks for sports games. The feel of this on my skin was very heavy and if you are looking for light weight, I would not recommend it. This blush really disappointed me. The packaging was also horrible.

I returned it and will continue to scrape the pans of my old palette until i find a suitable replacement. * The blush is show stopping. I get stopped all the time when i wear it. So confused why the reviews are bad bc this palette is gorgeous. the highlighter is pretty, and the bronzer is quite pigmented. Nothing too special- the blush is def a game changer tho. * I really wanted a cheek palette to cut down on clutter in my makeup bag. I was sorely disappointed to learn this wasn't it. The highlighter is just glitter. Way too coarse of a glitter than I prefer for a highlight. It looks nice as a shadow. The blush is more of a highlight, it's very iridescent. I learned that I prefer matte blush after using this. The bronzer warmed up my light complexion nicely but it does not make a good contour color; I use it more for a sun kissed glow. There is a lot of fall out from this palette.  It is usable but not as I intended it."

However, the bronzer is a little too yellow for my fair skintone, the shadows are pinky (personally, I would love a more neutral trio that I van use for day-to-night), and I would trade the shimmery blush for a contour shade or a matte highlighter shade. My opinions are based on the fact that I use this for an everyday palette on-the-go and not for a certain look. * I use this daily and does not break me out!! * I really like this product. I like using a cream blush underneath and then one of these on top to set it. You can't beat the price and the quality is very good. * I wish they would make more all-in-one palettes like this. It is good quality, and flattering shades. Please make more! * The bronzer made me look orange and the eyeshadow falls off of my face, same with the sparkles from the sparkly blush but the highlighter is amazing and the blush is very pigmented. * I thought this would be a fairly large sized face palette, but its tiny! Its like a mini face palette. This is what makes it great for travel, which is how I'll probably use it.

I'm tired of always having my shade range available online only. Beautiful palette, bold colors, and deep enough for the darkest skin tones. 

I just hate the fact that I have to wait days in order to get my shade most of the time. In addition to me having to purchase multiple shades in order to find my exact one.

Been using it since it came out. Just wish they had the bigger sized bottle. * I bought two of these. I bough the chachatint and the original rose benetint. They are two completely different textures and in my opinion should not be in the same line or category. The chachatint was more of a cream texture and was the perfect flush of orangey pink on cheeks and lips for a tropical destination. I loved it and was inspired to buy a more 'neutral', 'everyday' shade that made it easy to get ready. The original benetint rose stain seemed like the right shade, however the texture is COMPLETELY different and is more of a thin, watery consistency. It is hard to get an even coat and seems wrong to put anywear but the lips. I was hoping to wear it like the other, both on the cheeks and lips. I am disappointed and think this definitely needs a revamp to match the other stains in the line. I am still wanting to try the floratint on the premise that its the same texture as the chachatint stain. * This stuff smells so good and is a nice lip and cheek tint but it rubs off and doesn't last very long. * I love this benetint but there's one thing I don't like . It's really easy to spill and it smells like chemicals and it also taste like it. * Cute color and lasts long on lips as long as you leave it be! * love this but be careful if u leave it on too long unblended, then it might stay that way and, by that i mean it won't blend ever."

I brush it across my cheeks and over my nose for a sunburned effect, it's gorgeous. I had never used cream blush before. It's actually not that messy or inconvenient, and it doesn't feel greasy. Easy to get used to. * I was disappointed that that the color was more brown than pink. Also that it was very light in pigment. I needed to apply several layers before I saw any blush on my cheeks. 
My friend also bought this product but in a different shade. She had the opposite effect. Her tint, which was a bright pink, deposited too much color. * Product works well on my skin. Product does what it advertises to do * I have just recently started using cream blushes. The one in my current rotation is Rare Beauty's Vulnerable Melting Blush. I like it, however, it began pulling my foundation underneath. I also wanted a bit more pigment. I decided to go with Charlotte Tilbury's Lip and Cheek Glow. Oh my goodness it is so pretty. Every time I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I see how glowy this blush is. It looks even better with a highlighter. I am pretty fair, so I chose the shade Pillow Talk Colour of Dreams. This is exactly the shade I was looking for. The right amount of pigment to where I don't look bare or look like a clown. This is now my go-to blush for a no makeup-makeup look or full glam. * I've tried many cream/liquid blushes and this made it to holy grail. Usually terracotta works best for me but this is unique.  I think soft brick may be close.  It's more neutral than it looks. 
Blends easily with brush or sponge. Apply and look like a goddess. * Color: warm rosebud pink

Okay so I saw how this looked in the photos on the model and I had to try it. I am fair skinned and I love it! I am a blush girlie so this is great for me. I look sickly without blush. 

It applies very easily. The only thing I will say is sometimes all I want to wear is blush and in that instance I dont think it stays put as well/as long. I try to pair it with a little primer or a tiny bit of foundation and thats the perfect light every day look im going for."

But it is really great!! This palette last long especially if you prep and set it right! The colors are skin like. So its somehow natural looking while being so glowy and glamorous!! The glitter looks pretty big in the cream. But once on the skin it's gorgeous. Perfect ratio of glowy and shimmery! Nooot greasy of oily! * I loved my Nars O-gasm 🎨 to death; I wish it were permanent. This Iconic London Cream palette 🎨 is the next best thing - the closest cream 🎨 I've found at Ulta - to the Nars. I waited until I had a ton of points and a 20% off prestige coupon to purchase. I paid about $20 out of pocket for it. Now that I've used it a bunch I would/will pay full price if necessary. I'm 46, light complexion w/combo skin. These creams are very nice, pigmented and blend beautifully. I 'set' using the Nars Crystal Powder, then top areas w/desired powder products. I 'spot set'- chin, lower forehead, top half of cheeks and lightly on the nose. (Dior Forever Skin Glow foundation 1W).. Its great to take on the go/traveling. Nice packing - good bang for your buck 👍🏼. * Although the Iconic London Brush, Bronze & HL palette is kinda close- its still nowhere near my Nars Or*gasm cream face palette (limited edition). However, I love this palette for it's own reasons, which I listed above. * I would get this if you are scared of very pigmented blushes the contours are nice and creamy but not the blushes and the blushes have glitter. The highlight is nice and creamy as well. * All creams to use for cheeks eyelids and wherever i want a glow or highlight. Purchased on the half off sale . will use for travel . Its nice * you over age 60 ladies dont shy away from this product i own it  and it is pretty awesome ! i wear on cheeks sculpt bronze  highlight even uae as a natural eyeshadow with beautiful dark brown liner ! * I'm 45 - at this time in my life - my goal is to to keep my makeup routine between 5-10 minutes.  

This product was a good buy.  You can build it up to your liking, and it's very forgiving - just blend it out.

I imagine if you take good care of yourself and hydrate, the sky is the limit as far as how beautiful it looks on the skin.  

The blushes are not heavily pigmented, but are still lovely.  If I need a little extra, Tower 20 or Natasha Denona blushes work well."

Pigmentation is pretty poor all across the board. * I have been loving the oh so nudie stack to do my makeup on the go. The top is a buildable shimmery eyeshadow, the second layer works as a bronzer/blush combo on my fair skin, the lip balm adds a faint swipe of color, and the highlighter is nice. * So I got the Oh so Nudie stack on sale one day and gave it a shot even though I'm not a morphe fan. This killed it. The eyeshadow is especially good and super flashy and looks really pigmented when applied correctly. The blush is flattering for my tanner skin tone it's like the perfect blush and bronzer mix. But my fav is the face highlight balm, it's the best highlight ever. It's so flattering and real looking. No powder glitter or pigments that look good in one angle and terrible in the other. This is just a clear balm that doesn't rub in and disappear like others I have tried like this. It looks really good on their hint hint skin tint which I'm loving as well and use every day since it is the perfect oil free which is a must yet glowy foundation tint. Morphe2 is definitely doing it for me which is nice to find out because now that I see these other stacks I kind of need them... * I love the stacking idea but I'm can't decide if I love the product or not. I have the ""Violet Vibes"" version. The top layer is a very light pink eyeshadow with sparkles. it feels a bit chalky but it's alright. The second is a sparkly blush, again, a bit chalky and I don't love that it's sparkly but it's alright. The third layer is a berry colored lip product with a slightly sticky chapstick type consistency, which is nice but difficult and messy to apply without an applicator. The final one is almost like a glitter balm with chunky glitters. Definitely a bit of an oddball choice but can be fun on certain occasions. I would probably recommend this to a friend but the bottom two are a bit inconvenient and I do wish the powders were more buttery and high-quality feeling. * Wanted to love this. It's compact for travel, that's about all the props I can give it. It's cheaply made and should be sold as makeup for little girls to play in. Not impressed at all. Will be returning it . * The colors are perfect and exactly what I wanted, a warm yellow tan but the problems are the lip gloss tastes terrible like perfume and the eyeshadow irritated my eyes as soon as I put it on. I'm pretty sure a lot of that was because of the glitter fall out. I do have sensitive eyes so who knows. The gloss smells nice but doesn't taste nice unfortunately. There's pretty much no color which could be overlooked if it tasted better and was moisturizing. The blush is pretty sheer which I prefer a buildable blush so that's ok and the highlight is sheer with no color to it which is also ok because it looks more natural. All in all I would not repurchase this and have no desire to try other colors. * I've bought around 3 of these because I truly love the product in itself. It's convenient, pretty, and easy to use especially when it's a quick day or I'm travelling with it. the only big downside from me that's disappointing is the top glitter keeps breaking and falling out, in which glitter then gets everywhere. It's again a nice product besides that and it's making me hesitant to buy again as I'd like to not have to clean up a glitter mess for once"

You can create a natural flush with this blush, without appearing too heavy or patchy; OR, you can build it up for a dramatic look. There is some fall out as expected, but other than that, highly recommend! * So amazing for the price!!! High quality. Pigmented yet blendable and it lastss!! So so niceee esp for the price would def reccomend!! * The color is a little sharp..but it definitely lasts longer than any other powder blush I've tried in the last few years * I took away 1 star because it's so pigmented. I've learned to work around it, but I know that a lot of people don't really care for that much pigment. The Rosewood color is gorgeous. It gives a very smoothing effect to the skin. The Infallible line is top notch. * Decided to give this blush a shot (in the shade fearless coral) and it does not dissappoint! I use a kabuki brush to apply.. which picks up quite a bit so I go ahead and dab a few dots of foundation on top right after with a beauty blender so just the right amount shines through 🩷"

Someone from Ulta told me that I can use this as a blush and eyeshadow and that's what I have been doing!  It's pretty pigmented but very blend-able as well.  I would recommend this product for someone that wants buildable but natural blush and eyeshadow! * Beautiful shade for my red hair and fair skin * I am a fan of estee lauder blushes! I've hit pan for three of them! all the colors are gorgeous and leaves a beautiful finish that looks effortless * I LOVE this blush, and have been using it for 5 years!! * Love it, soft palette would purchase again. * I will definitely be buying this again great stuff,looks great on * I didn't have any powder blush I loved so I decided to try this out and I'm SO GLAD I did! This is one of my favorite go-to products. I love the mini brush it comes with, I use it on my cheeks, tip of my nose and on my eyelids and I'm always amazed by how simply stunning it is."
117,nyx professional makeup,sweet cheeks soft cheek tint blush,pimprod2016401,2565838," * I've repurchased the shade Nude 'Tude twice now since this launched. Its not that you need a lot of product, its just that I use it pretty frequently. Its a neutral shade that just looks so natural on my skin, goes with any and all makeup looks. I bought two other shades as well, and they are nice but very bright and don't get used as much. 

The formula of this is a whipped mousse-like texture that is matte and blurring. It dries semi-quickly, so apply one cheek at a time, but don't stress about it setting too fast. I don't find it difficult to work with, nor is it patchy. * I found these shades to be far too pigmented and matte for my fair skin. They aren't easily blendable and dry down super quick. I normally love NYX, but i think they just used their matte liquid lipsticks and put them in a blush tube! * I love this blush. I purchased this blush twice already. I love how it settles on my skin, I like the color payoff. Its a good blush. The only thing that could be different is if they made some natural finished blushes with a similar formula. * I got this product in the advent calendar in the very dark color, Bombshell and as a fair skin toned girlie I instantly thought oh no, this is not for me. Boy was I wrong!! This stuff is extremely versatile! It sheers out in a way that makes it usable for me but can be built up enough to work for others. The blendability on this is magic, way better than any other liquid blush ive tried. The glow on thjs is beautiful. Something I thought wouldnt work for me is now my new favorite and I cant wait to buy other colors!! * This is honestly one of my favorite blushes.
I have dry/mature skin with some texture, and blends beautifully and stays put.  
The doe foot applicator is chef's kiss.  I tap a couple spots and blend with a brush! * My favorite blush! Ive tried so many blushes but this is forever my favorite. The texture is so nice, it blends beautifully into my skin instead of just sitting on top like a lot of blushes tend to do. I only need one swipe on the back of my hand to cover both cheeks! * This stuff is so perfect. Its the best liquid blush in my collection and i will always come back for more when i run out. I wear it everyday and if you are cool toned and fair skinned like me coralicious is the best blush tint. Looks so natural."
118,persona,dreamstick cream blush,pimprod2033817,2617550," * For reference, I bought the cream blush along with the cream bronzer and comparing the two formulas, the blush is more like oily and slick like. I dont know if its because my blush came a little melted or thats just the formula. It could also be quality control because I see that in reviews from this brand in other products. Overall, I like the product. I didn't experience any patchiness or color fading. It's better to tap this product in than smear it. I have combination/oily acne prone, textured, skin and it lasted on my skin without any problems. * I am an advid makeup collector and have MANY cream blushes in my collection. These are definitely some of my absolute favorites! I own teddy, bubble gum and Jam and they are all beautiful but jam and teddy are something else! Out of all the blushes i own im always reaching for those 2 specifically. I have fair to light skin and teddy is the absolute best neutral everyday blush that goes with every make up look. Jam is also fabulous. It looks like a natural berry flush on the cheeks. Super blendable and creamy and i love how most of them have a matching powder blush to set with * Love, love this blush! So pigmented and melts easily * Perfect tones, pigmentation is there and you could never overdo it, blends like a dream, easily buildable, smooth application * this has becone my holy grail blush as someone with intensely dry skin. i cannot use powders at all because they suck the moisture out of my skin and have me looking dry, cakey, and flakey all day. this blush is INCREDIBLE. the texture is BUTTER and the color payoff is ridiculously good. easy to swipe on and go for a low-key day, but my favorite means of application is to use a brush across the stick and buff onto my cheeks. given the intense color payoff, a light hand in many layers has proven far more effective if i'm looking for a polished, diffused, ""is-she-wearing-makeup?"" blush. my tried and true is layering teddy like a bronzer with a touch of the cherry color on top. will buy in more colors if they come back in stock!! * Wanted to love this, but it fades in about one hour. Color was nice but I prefer other cream blushes. * I got this in the shade teddy after having it in my cart for a while, and i LOVE it so much!!! The shade is the perfect blush / bronzer medium, and it is the most easy to blend blush i have ever tried (i also use merit, rare beauty, patrick ta) nothing is as smooth and blendable as this!!! Teddy is also the PERFECT sunkissed color"

A little goes a long way on my skin. And i dont need to set it, so easy for morning in a rush. The only con is the pan size makes it a little hard for a blush brush to get an even distribution and using hand leaves an oil imprint * The blush was a little too light for my skin but the highlighter is perfect * Nice color payoff but highlighter fell put of pan and broke in a million pieces. Too expensive to buy again and didn't love it that much * I get so many compliments when I wear this saying I look more pretty and healthy (the colds been killing my complexion lol) * I bought this on whim mainly wanting the highlighter for eyeshadow and thought the blush was a powder and would maybe be used sparingly.  But it's a cream!!  The blush is absolutely beautiful!!  It's pink but there's a slight golden peach which gives a gorgeous neutral tone.  I use a brush and just stipple it over the cheeks!!!  Absolutely stunning formula!!  I'm glad I made a mistake!! * Great pan with buildable glowing shades"
121,natasha denona,berry pop cheek trio,pimprod2042907,2620853," * I just bought this. Loved it, but there is actually very little product and it should have lasted much longer. It shattered and both the blush and highlighter broke apart. I am so bummed. For the price it should be much better quality. * I almost didn't grab this one because I didn't think I would love it, but after all the great reviews I gave it a go and there are 0 regrets. The balm is perfection and the cream blush needs a dab to pick up pigment. The highlight is chefs kiss and I'm not a daily highlight person, but I've work this one every day since I got it. * Love this palette so much. The pigment is so beautiful and gives you that perfect berry tone. The higher lighter is also so perfect and a formula like no other! I love the MY DREAM CHEEK TRIO so this is also so perfect as its not as deep! * These formulas are insane, super soft! I like wearing the different shades alone but they are wear beautifully together. I also find the throughout the day my blush will fade - not with this product. Thank you Natasha * most incredible blush formula! a little goes a long way so it'll last me long. the berry shade is very flattering on my skin tone too * I loved mixing the cream blush and the tinted glow! Really gave the airbrushed effect I was trying to achieve. * Beautiful color and formula"

It's a light and soft texture that blends effortlessly and wears all day well. * I've been waiting for these to drop on beauty steal again to reorder. I love these! * This product was so thick and greasy that it just sat on top of my skin like frosting. I really hated the blush especially. The bronzer consistency was a bit more blendable but looked comepletely orange on me. First time trying this brand and i dont wish to try anything else. Its so expensive for bad quality. Pass. * I really like the pocket size * The highlight is not that great in my opinion.  The color is meh, nothing special.  I absolutely love the bronzer and the blush is pretty.  These are small for the price but it's a nice way to sample unfamiliar product.  I would definitely recommend buying a full size of the bronzer or blush!  So easy to blend, beautiful and looks great all day!  Also wanted to mention my inside mirror was chipped and both kits that I purchased!!! * Great shades to enhance your look * This is my first time trying any products from NUDESTIX. Im no stranger to cream products, however. I trally, really like these! The colors look great on my skin tone, which is somewhere around ""medium"". I find the best way to apply these products is by rubbing a makeup brush right over the top of the product, rather than applying directly to my face. The colors and finish is so pretty. Its natural looking, yet not so much that it just blends away. Seems to last a relatively long time, as well. I will definitely be purchasing more from this brand."

Found it recently and now I have color again! Works great on 80 y/o skin too! * I have fair skin, so I was a little nervous at first when trying this....but it's GORGEOUS!!! * This is sooo pretty on the skin.

Obviously purchased it because I can apply it, keep my hands clean and not have to carry around in additional brush or beauty blender. * First time buyer of this product; love love everything about it. The packaging, color and type selection.

Application is great too * I decided j wanted to try a blish stick instead of powder so I chose this one and im so glad i did! Ive had this blush for about a year now and i still have plenty left! I would definitely recommend! * I have oily skin…really oily, so I wasn't really expecting it to last all day.  I was surprised!  I put it on, great blendability, perfect amount of pigment, and the color, ""juicy melons"" is stunning…. But I went on a hike that day and walked around in the sun, and when I got home it still looked great.  Awesome blush.  Definitely going to pick up more shades and I definitely recommend to anyone. * I am an avid cream blush user and have tried many different brands. I decided to give this a try after hearing a lot of good things about them, but I unfortunately did not like it. The longetivity isn't the best, even for being matte - the minute you rub your face it's gone (even when I set with powder blush on top). It's unfortunate because I loved the natural color it gives and that it's buildable, but I can't justify the price for the lack of lasting power. Maybe if you like to wear very light makeup and don't care for your blush not lasting long would I get this (even then there's better for less $$$, such as the elf putty blush) * I bought this during the 21 Day promotion.  I wanted to try but a bit pricey but on sale i will try.  I was skeptical but I will say I love this product.  Im older with typical challenges we older girls face.  This product goes on smooth. Blemds beautifully and lasts all day.  I love it.  Really great product. * I was so excited go try this when i saw influencers using it so i immediately purchased during the 50% off sale. The packaging and brush tip is cute but its almost impossible to get the blush to blend out and i feel like it could easily mess with whatever makeup you have on underneath. The mirror also came cracked. Other blushes are cheaper and more blendable with better color pay off, i returned and bought a rare beauty blush instead and i'm much happier"

This another disappointment in recent years with changing once elegant classy formulas and packaging to cheap glitter makeup with flimsy packaging. I was hopeful the color mist would be a replacement for my beloved in touch cream blush in clarity but no way!!! This reminds me of something I would see in my 3 year old daughters play makeup kit. The glitter in this is beyond overwhelming and actually makes skin look drier. Please bring back in touch cream blush . I think it might be time to move on and find a new makeup brand for my needs. * Disappointed, too much gliter and doesn't blend well. * I got Glorious and am relatively fair, and I love it. It doesn't last super long, but it's easy to re-apply. I like to put it on even when I don't have other makeup on (like when I just woke up or go for a walk or whatever) for just a natural slightly flushed look. I was worried it would be too dark or too glittery for me, but it's not. Love it!"
129,revolution beauty,revolution x roxxsaurus blush burst palette,pimprod2017921,2566295," * I gave this product 3 star because even tho I like how pigmented the blushes are, it's not easy to blend once to put it on your cheeks if you don't blend it well that's it, love the variety of colors this palette has but that's it. * It has a lot of shades and not a bad blush. But if you want more vibrant and just smoth blushes then maybe save uour money and buy a better pallatte but if your trying yo save a coin and just want multiple blushes that arent bad then go ahead * Pros:
Great variety of blush shades, all in wearable colors.
Great for fair to medium skin tones (neutral/olive/warm undertones mostly)

Cons:
The wear time is average.
This palette def wont work for deep/deepest skin tones.
May not be flattering on cool tone skin. * Affordable and beautiful * love love love the dofferent shades of colors, plus very essy to apply * Really love this blush set! I am a fair skin woman so I am not sure if it would be as pigmented for my darker complexion pals but if you are fair skin it works well. Blushes are blendable and enjoy that I am able to switch my blush around each day. * If your lookihg for a budget friendly blush palette this one is the one you should get! I got it out of curiosity and wanting many different blushes without having to indivually buy a bunch, and this was a great choice! Pigment is great and I am in love with it!"

It looks amazing and feel like I have no makeup on. I got a free sample in exchange for my honest review #florencepanel * Gifted this product & we love it! Have it in several of the shades!

As someone with pretty oily skin, especially on my cheeks, this is one of the only blushes that I find wears well on me and stays put throughout the day. It never goes on patchy, and is pigmented but not too pigmented. Also, being a very fair person with slightly cooler undertones, the shades are very flattering. * Love the Blush perfect color * I wanted to try a pink blush( normally wear browns) after  looking at several brands, I chose this one. So glad I did. She's pretty!! Very pigmented but blends beautifully. * I have used this before and I like the brand. Good quality of make up * I am a higher end girly but i will always fry to find affordable gems. I kept seeing tiktok videos saying this was one. I tried the shade mauveulous and it was not smooth on the skin. Just kinda sat weird and didnt blend. Returned. * Ive tried to apply this about 5 times and theres no pigment and it falls out so much. Such a waste of a product * I was so sad when Too Faced discontinued ""your love is king"" and I finally discovered ""Mauvilous"" is nearly identical! It's a very bright purple-toned pink. Very pigmented and can be a little tricky to blend without foundation, but brushing over it with a little translucent powder helps."

Pills badly and doesn't blend well. * Never tried this brand before as not popular in the UK , really liked the blush , great colour payoff and long lasting, will try more ! Made in Italy is great and great value for money! * The color is pretty but goes on greasy and stains your clothes ( it comes out in the washer) if you are not careful. Not lasting * I love this color! It looks fantastic on medium-toned skin. It applies smoothly and is buildable. It may look intimidating, but it goes on as a lovely dark pink shade. Super cute! * I got the shade big o and it is a gorgeous red blush!! 
I was a little hesitant after reading other reviews but the color was so perfect I decided to just try it anyways. 
Ive applied it with both a wet brush and a dry one and I have to say the dry brush was the way to go.

This is so beautiful on the skin and doesn't take my foundation off underneath either. This is a huge win for the price. * I have very fair skin so I picked Blush Beam which is the lightest color available. It is much more red in person. Even the slightest bit is too much. For me it was a total waste of money. * this is definitely my new favorite blush it looks so natural it's also so easy to blend I can just is my fingers if I wanted to I would definitely recommend * I have light med Asian skin and use flamingo glow. Pat it on. It looks so amazing * These are gorgeous! I picked up 2 during the sale but will be getting the rest of them. These are a very thin, creamy, glowy sheer blushes that make highlighter unnecessary. No detectable glitter just the most beautiful sheen that brings your cheeks back to life! This formula does not dry down however, they do become less sticky but doesn't dry down completely.  Therefore, I would not consider these long wearing but that isn't in the claims either. As someone with dry skin, these are stunning and everything I want, and doesn't emphasize texture. I heard these are a dupe for the makeup by Mario plumping cheek blushes and I can totally see that being the case but I do not own those. * Such a creamy blush with good pigment. It is now one of my staple blushes. Good for those who like to look glowy. Last me all day * I have fair, mature skin. I purchased Garden Party. I applied after foundation and powder. I love the color, although it did pull a little more peachy on me. Applies more sheer but is easily buildable. And the sheen it gives is beautiful. Not shimmery, just glowing. The finish reminds of the Makeup by Mario soft pop plumping blush veil. Love this blush, highly recommend!!"
134,morphe 2,perk up cheek & lip color,pimprod2026623,2585069," * Its cute and sheer, its not heavy and I really like how it has a perfect and light shimmer to it too! But it doesn't last that long tbh. I wear it to school but at the end of the day some of it is gone. I would still recommend because the shimmer is really cute and I haven't found a blush that is cuter than this for everyday wear. It would be perfect if it lasted longer tho. I see everyone say the blush leaves them patchy, but that is most likely because they have facial hair. I shave my facial hair and it is no longer patchy after I shave it. * I do love the color. However, the longevity of this blush sucks. It doesn't last half a work day. I catch myself reapplying mutiple times a day to keep the color i want. * Really soft and truly works both on cheeks and lips. * Love this product. Goes on smooth. Looks and feels natural. Ive been using for a few years. * 3 years of everyday use I love love love the mauve so much please never discontinue!!!! The formula is incredible it looks so natural and beautiful. I've never found anything better. So much better than any shade of pillow talk for lip * I use it everyday. Super pigmented. Slides on easy! * I'm new to makeup and i wanted to try a budget cream blush. I bought Rosy Wishes but I also liked the super pink one. So far, ive really liked it! Its easy to use; you can use your fingers or a sponge to buff it out, but I prefer using a brush. While it seems to set down and dry, it does wear away easily.

Mine have been thrown around, packed & moved, in & out of my purse with no issues. My favorite is Summer Breeze for just regular days. It adds just a little youthful played in the sun touch. It's mattee too which I like because I prefer the sparkle & shine to come from my highlighter. If you wanna go a little more bold, Red Riot is also stunning. It's a really great product, that doesn't cost very much & lasts a long time.

Otherwise, I do recommend it to those that don't have a fragrance issue. * It applies beautifully, is pigmented but not difficult to work with, is super easy to blend out, and lasts really well for a cream blush. Peony has been my go to everyday pink and Cotton Candy is the perfect, cool toned pink. Its so flattering. * Love this blush has great pigment and blends down great.

It looks so beautiful when applied with a brush, and it lasts all day. * I got this one in Coral and its perfect for winter * Very pigmented, easy to apply using a dense fluffy brush. A little goes a long way and I absolutely am here for the flawless pretty achieved. * I'm really annoyed with this one because the packaging seems like it would be a piece of cake to make refillable, but refills aren't sold for it?

I have aging, combo-oily skin and these stay ALL day. I use a smaller, less dense brush to stipple on my cheeks/temples/nose and it's perfection. I wish more people talked about this product because it deserves it! * This product is very lightweight and sheer which is perfect for summer months where you don't want a full face of makeup. Also the colors are nice (bought peach and cherry).

However, it instantly dries once it hits your face so you need to QUICK so that you aren't left with a streak of unblended color. Its hard to blend out and working to get it to blend moves any makeup that was underneath before application. It also looks patchy on the skin due to difficulty blending. * I've been eyeing this product for a while and decided to try Cherry as an affordable option to the red blush trend. This is STUNNING. Definitely best blended with your fingers right after application before it sets. Dewy and natural and effortless! * I bought this blush as a dupe for the you know what, and i ended up really enjoying this in my routine. The shade is very pretty and it feels so nice and cooling on your skin. Its just a little to blend. * This is a really pretty stain for lips and cheeks! I love the different shades. The price point is decent. I'd say this is a milk dupe but I think undone came out with this first! * OMG I love this blush! It's so buildable and it feels cool on your skin. It's a natural flush that you can keep subtle or really make it pop. * its like the tarte blush sticks but way better. they actually dry down and don't leave a greasy feel at all. ive had so many compliments its unreal. definitely more pigmented than a lot of other blush sticks/stains (looking at you benetint). excellent price for a great product"
140,iconic london,kissed by the sun multi-use cheek glow,pimprod2039117,2608756," * I have been looking for a blush like this for a long time, one with a highlight and in this exact color. Hot stuff is probably the best color ever, with the soft pink tone and the peachy goldish highlight!

I've never tried iconic London before and this makes me want to try more of their stuff, this blushlighter is so good! it goes on so soft and silky smooth, plus it also stays on well! I like that the color can be built up too, for more of a pop. I think all the colors are very neutral and flattering, and I want them all! * I've been looking for something exactly like this for a long time. a blush with a highlight and I've finally found it! it's so soft and silky and applies like a dream! it also has good staying power. I purchased the color hot stuff and let me tell you! it's the perfect color for us medium warm olive/gold toned people out here! as a reference I use UD 50WY in stay naked liquid foundation. this is now my favorite blush! now what am I supposed to do with all my MAC blushes I won't be using, lol! 
I have used this as a regular blush, which gives a soft glow all over the cheeks and as as highlighter over different blush. if using as a highlighter, it does have a pink under tone, so I had to blend it a little with the blush I did use and it looked so good still! this was my first iconic London item I've ever tried, and I'm now obsessed and am going to have to try more products from them! * Love how it looks on my skin. * Easy to blend and a good shade that works well on medium skintones without feeling heavy or overly saturated * Love the tanny glow on my fair skin. I can wear it date/night depending on the occasion. Soft and seamless intensity formula that leaves a gentle shimmery on my cheeks. * Easy to blend blush... Like the color * This is so beautiful. It doesnt matter which color, just do yourself the favor and thank me later."

I wanted to love it, but unfortunately it was bad and a waste of money. Beautiful color though. * I got the shade Province as a GWP. I am super impressed with this. I am quite fair (shade 110 Haus Labs) and this is a wonderful shade for a natural blush that looks great on neutral-warm undertones. Going to purchase. * It's a lovely color, but it does not blend well at. It dries very quickly and won't blend out once dried. The color is very light and when I tried to add more to build it up, but it just wiped away what was there along with my foundation. While it doesn't work well as a bush I found it works very well as an eyeshadow. I really liked the color so I tried it as an eyeshadow and it looks really nice. It also stays on very well. So if you find it's not the blush for you try it as an eyeshadow. * I'm surprised at the negative reviews. I love the consistency of this product - it's thinner than a cream but thicker than water. I just use my fingers to gently dab on my cheeks. It blends well and looks natural. I do layer it on top of my foundation - maybe if you're dabbing your whole face and then blending it might dry and be difficult to blend out, but I haven't had any issues the way I use it. The color is not thick so it looks very natural. This is my favorite new blush. * I loved the color but sadly I had to return it because it was patchy. No matter if it was on bare skin or with skin tint * Loved it but you just need so much product ao not worth the cost"

I have to say I am impressed with how smooth they glide on and how buildable the colour is. They have become part of my everyday makeup routine and I am totally in love with the colour payoff. * I actually got this as a gift for my mom as I've heard really good things about Nudestix blushes. She really loved it and says its easy to use and creamy * If you want to create a look in less than 5 mins this is the easiest kit you'll ever use! You have your blush, bronze and glow all in one kit making it super easy and fast to use. The shades are very creamy and are easy to blend with your fingers. * Everyone needs this kit! It is the perfect size for on-the-go and has a blush, bronze and glow color to use to create an easy and effortless look. * Hydrating pigmented good performance great size i specially love the bronzer * As i have gotten older my skin needs creams instead of powder. I sae these for such a good price and i got them. I love them they blend so nice and creamy. Its a perfect size too so they dont dry out and i can use them fully. * You can easily build up the products depending on what kind of look you're going for, and they blend so smoothly onto skin with fingertips or a sponge! I use this after prepping skin with DIME tinted sunscreen. The highlight blends best with fingertips as it is a little dark, so warm fingers disperse the glow a little better! This is a wonderful set for someone getting into more natural & simple glowwy makeup :)"

I am very very fair, so not much product is needed, but I'm definitely going to keep ""Bubble"" on hand all the time. * Cute Barbie pink blush. You can go light or intense with these and I appreciate that. A little highlighter with these are perfection * I absolutely adore this blush. Saw reviews where they said it has no lasting power but mine will literally last a full 12 to 14 hours. The only downside I've noticed is that it can be a bit hard to blend. * Easy application. Smooth finish. Love this. The color Bubble on my cool fair skin is perfect. Usually even blushed labeled cool/neutral still afloat orange-y on me but this one is lovely. * I am a blush lover and I just found my favorite blush! This blush is simply beautiful, easy to blend, buildable, and long lasting. If you're thinking about it, buy it! You won't be disappointed. * Beautifully pigmented and buttery smooth application.  You cannot go wrong with this blush.  It blends, it builds, it hits the mark the first stroke. * hard to blend and if you use to much, it's hard to buff off"
145,e.l.f. cosmetics,luminous putty blush,pimprod2033325,2601104," * If you are looking for a super or even decently pigmented blush, this is not the one. If you are looking for a shiny blush and is barely noticeable then this is the one. For reference, my skin tone is similar to mocha and when I used this blush, in the shade Belize, I didnt get much pigment. However, I did get the shine. * I had high hopes for this blush but I'm not loving it. it has a strong odor and barely shows up! it's super sheer. if you're going for a very natural look, it works. so I guess I'll use it for daytime? I had to apply it multiple times to even see a bit of color. another huge issue I had is thar there was a finger print already on it when I received it. I had to go in and wipe it with a cloth before using it. why even send me a used product? so disappointed 😞 * I love the subtle sun kissed glow this blush gives me! It blends so well and love that is has shea butter in it. I also have very sensitive skin and this works wonders. * First of all, the finish is beautiful. I was a bit nervous at first because it does seem that there are some really ultra fine bits of glitter in this. I actually don't mind glitter so much, but this just wasn't my goal when I was buying the product. However, when actually applied it just looks very radiant and luminous in a natural way. Like in a celeb way where they seem to glow from within and have no worry in the world lol. And it's not in a greasy way or an oily way that many cream, liquid, and balm blushes are. 

Honestly, I would be keeping this if it just suited my skin tone. This is the second to last darkest shade, and it's the only blush dark enough in the selection that has a rosy tone. The darkest shade seems more like a bronzer imo. This product applies very sheer and the product isn't as burnt red-y purple as in the photo. It's more of a pink. It's not really buildable either. The swatch coverage shown is misleading. I don't necessarily need another pink shade that washes me out in my collection. I have enough of that unfortunately. It seems that these brands never really think about black skin when making these shades, not do they think about the performance on melanated skin. It's honestly very exhausting. If you are any darker than Zoe Kravitz, maybe leave this one on the shelf. Or use it as a bronzer topper. When will POC actually get shades that suit us? I'm so tired of spending money on things that just don't seem to work for me :( * I am a Danessa Myricks super fan. I love so many of her products especially the cream blushers. So naturally, I excitedly bought her lowlighters - terrible on me. So I took a chance in the ELF blushes - the absolute bomb!!! Want them to make a million more colors. Fab prod, terrific price! * The products applies fairly smooth. * I dont know why it took me this long to finally try this blush but OMG. The formula is amazing and I feel like it looks as good as my high end blushes. It has a great staying powder, mind you I have dry skin. It is almost as good as the new liquid blushes. It tends to get a little bit dry after a while but even my expensive cream blushes do, you just need to warm it up a little bit with your finger and your good to go. 
I got the shade Maui because I'm so into mauve blush and this was perfect!!"

Natural looking color.0 * Such a fun makeup to use! the jelly delivers a punch! super pigmented. I love the flushed color for the summer sun burnt blush look. Excited to try some other colors. * I seen a review with somone as the same complexion as me, it looked nice on her. The pigment was actually there! But when i had tride it myself its like the gel was disappearing as i rubbed it in. Im disappointed at the fact it didn't work for me, even with layering. Plus the actual product is TINY! * This product gives a natural flush to the cheeks. It does dry down fast, so you have to work with the product quickly. My complaint is the size of the product. It's pricey for the amount you actually get. The tube is small and it's not even filled all the way with product. * Love it 😍 * I am so glad I found this after a long time gel blush product from another company was discontinued. This is a tint that is buildable and it looks like naturally flushed cheeks, which is exactly what I was looking for!"
148,winky lux,cheeky rose cream blush,pimprod2022397,2578873," * This is an amazing blush! It goes on so smoothly, and it's very easy to blend! I also love the packaging, and the way it's shaped like a rose! I highly recommend this blush! * i use a brush to apply this product but even then it does not appear to be as noticeable compared to my other blush products (powder, liquid). very pretty design, though, so makes for a cute gift for someone. using a brush does not ruin the rose either.

when i finally do get some pigment, the color is beautiful. i got this blush in the color 'crown'. but it is just not worth the hassle to work it in. * I almost didn't buy this because there's no way this works, right? Like it's so pretty, it's just the aesthetic, form and not function, etc. NOPE. I got the color Crown and it is not nearly as red as it looks in photos, more of a rosy brown. It's the perfect all natural flush (I have light/medium skin with golden undertones). I've used it about a dozen times or more and the rose still maintains it's shape (I use an angled brush). It's also just so pretty that I reach for it over my other blushes now. * Had problems with other bushes and when I found this, I loved it. It's creamy and doesn't need a whole lot to pop. 🩷🩷🩷 * Winky Lux had a luxe line, LAQA, for a number of years and i LOVED their cream highlighters/blush in Preacher's Daughter (coral) and Rose Royce (light rose/pink.) When they ended the line i bought as many as i could. 

So now im out of the Rose Royce and haven't found a dupe. I was really hoping this would be it, but it's rock hard, difficult to apply and cheaply made. Yes, the rose is fun to look at, but it's not an effective product in any way. So disappointed. * I am really unhappy with this blush. It's patchy and doesn't last at all. It looks cute. * I've had 3 of these in different shades and it dissappears within 30 seconds of applying it like literally evaporates. so weird."

Found through TikTok on a drug store makeup routine and I'm obsessed! * I love this blush sm. You only need a tiny tiny bit bc it's so pigmented and tbh it's easy to put on too much. This is perfect (savage coral) for a bright pink/peach shade. It's not too cool toned but not too orange-y either and blends super easily but doesn't smudge/mix with foundation. Great price & pigment, & long-lasting:) * Very beautiful blush. Probably not the best youll find but definitely not the worst. * This is the perfect liquid blush consistency it doesn't smear or move its glowy and its buildable perferct under powders or by itself. * its so sheer and oily. barely any pigment and it doesnt last. * So this blush is really pretty and buildable. It looks very bright and pigmented, but it's not too pigmented, but I have oily skin and it wears off really quickly."

151,flower beauty,lip and cheek gel crush,pimprod2018369,2597110," * This is a great blush if you have dry skin and are going for a minimal makeup look. They are not super pigmented. You get a sheer wash of color and lots of glow. This is my every day blush, but not my special occasion / full glam blush. It does not dry down completely, but I wouldn't call it sticky. It gives a very dewy finish. * I have both coconut crush and blackberry crush. I bought the berry one first and love it so much I thought I'd try the coconut color.

I apply this blush using a brush and tap it in. You can make it as light/subtle as you want. It has a nice dewy finish which I love since I have dry skin. It doesn't remove foundation underneath.

As a lip color, the staying power isn't that good, but it's a nice color and shine. More like a balm.

To compare the colors I have, the berry is more pink/purple whereas the coconut is more red/orange. They are the same depth though. I have fair neutral skin so I can go between a deep winter and a deep autumn depending on the color scheme I  use. * Gives a flushed, healthy glow rather than looking like you applied blush.  On my minimal makeup days the glow I get from it is priceless.  I have fair skin and the raspberry was perfect for me.   I have moved towards cream blushes in the past few years and this is my favorite. * Meh. The color is pretty but it doesn't wear well. The strawberry shade is a bit light, even for my fair/light complexion. The color blends well enough but it sort of sits on top of the skin and slides around. It does not stay in place, if that makes sense. I keep re-trying it because I want to love it but it just isn't a great gel/cream blush option for me. * Its easy to build on (I do three swipes on each cheek), easy to blend with a brush, great pigment. My current favorite blush. * Literally NO pigment and made my base cake/oxidize immediately. It was like rubbing a grease stick on my skin. Even on it's own as a dewy look, still does not show up. Also not brown and black friendly in the slightest due to the drop of pigment added. I have a medium olive tone and I used the most vibrant shade, it  did not show up. Don't waste your money, Get Pixi for that price! * Its not pigment the most but its creamy and really blendable. I really like it"

Smells like strawberries and its such a nice pink pigmented color. The strawberries do come off after use but other than that highly recommend. * I always get comments about it! I am definitely buying this again!🥰 * I solely bought this blush because i saw how cute the strawberries were, well they don't stay on! They're just like powder stamped strawberries and the moment you swipe with your brush, they will come off. The color is very pretty but it doesnt last on the skin. I could barely tell at the end of the day that i had any blush on. The formula itself seemed a bit chalky and it took a couple swipes to get the blush to build up. It smells like fresh strawberries, but what good is for the product to smell good if it doesn't perform as it should? Too bad i threw away the box it came in, or i would return it. Not worth the price tag in my opinion. * The scent is too sweet for me, but the color is nice and the texture of it is too. * the scent is very sweet and it leaves a nice pink on your cheeks as well * The smell is absolutely addicting lol.

I love love love 160 berry smooch. its the same color as Tarte Natural Beauty and i love that in from the cold flush. it gives snow white cheeks. The color is a red with cool pink undertone and it looks so healthy and natural. I love this as it gives a watercolored effect, its longwearing and smoothing without falling into pores. I will forever repurchase this as it is my fav drugstore blush * I absolutely loved this product. It was a good shade. One I would have picked would work for me, so I was pleasantly surprised with that. Will be adding this to my routine. I love that I get to test free products. * Love the glow of this blush you can use it as blush and highlighter. Gives a nice glow to the skin. The pigmentation is also great it was packed nicely and there is no scent that bothered my skin. * This Milani cheek kiss liquid blush + glow in dolce pink gives me a healthy glow to my cheeks and face.  It brights up my face instantly.  With just this blush and some lip gloss i am ready to go out.  The dot application is so easy to apply and it is blend able depending how pink you want your face to look.  I really like this liquid blush and will use it as often as i can. * If you love a natural sheer blush that melts into your skin this blush is the one to have! I love the glowing finish it gives me.

The blush blends like a dream and the highlighter is unbelievable. It blends so easily with just a few taps from my finger. I cannot say enough about these two. Love. The powder highlighter is pretty and I do like it, but when you pair it with the two creams, it really isn't anything special. I wish it had been another cream. Another highlighter color or blush color in the cream formula would have been amazing. That's why I have 4 stars and not 5. Still fully worth the price tag for the two products though. * I'm not sure why the reviews are so great for this pallette. first of all, it arrived broken and second I'm pretty fair to medium skin and I have to put several coats of this on and it's hardly noticeable. In my opinion, definitely not worth the price. Highly disappointed. * I love this palette! The blush is agreat color and the cream highlighter is my favorite highlighter of all time. I use the powder highlighter as more of a highlight eyeshadow. I only wish the blush was a cream formula like the middle highlighter. * This texture is stunning. These formulas glide beautifully, no streakiness, perfect tones, and the texture is stunning. Believe the hype. Natasha's makeup is QUALITY. Worth every dime! * The interplay between color and texture in this palette is genius. I cant remember yhr kast time i felt so oretty, as i did when i wore this.

Maybe the other shades are better, but I don't even want to try them after being so disappointed. * I bought this on a whim in the chocolate color not knowing how I'd use it and it's now a staple in my travel makeup bag, use it for bronzer, eyeshadow, eyeliner and even on the lips mixed with some lip balm it's perfect multiuse, compact travel friendly product.

167,ofra cosmetics,unconditional mini mix face palette,pimprod2042795,2620023," * This palette is stunning. Super easy to blend, it's pigmented and build able. It's my go to! * The colors are amazing and highly pigmented. I use it for everyday wear and it's my new favorite pallet! My only complaint is the shimmer eyeshadow isn't as pigmented as everything else, but that's not a huge problem. * I love this face palette. It is stunning & universally flattering on  most skintones & ages.  I love having mostly matte eyeshadows & the purple & green add neutral pops of color, compliment brown, green & hazel eyes & make lovely liners. I rarely wear bronzer & highlighter but the options provides are nice on my light to medium skin tone & not OTT. The blush is the perfect neutral pinky peach shade. * This eyeshadow palette is so stunning, so blendebel & great for travel * I bought this pallet when it first came out and absolutely love it! I use it every day! I've created so many wonderful looks with it. I'm going to have to repurchase it as I have used it so much that I've hit pan on a few already. * I just ordered this gorgeous collection. I even paid extra for shipping so I can get it before Christmas. I cannot wait to try out the combinations of colors, especially the purple. Fun fact…each of the colors are named after Rhonda's children and life! How sweet is that? 💜"
168,kiko milano,unlimited blush,pimprod2032252,2595747," * I LOVE KikosMilanos blushes, the package alone feels luxurious and fancy, the blushes apply with a velvet finish and it's just the flush of color I need without overpacking too much onto my cheeks. I usually swipe then pat it gently on my cheekbones. I repurchased a backup recently but I've been using this blush for a few years and it's lasted me that long. Still on the first one and don't want to run out when I do. 

Shade I purchased: 6

My Skintone: Light-Medium (Olive Tone) * Its cute but i thought it would be bigger 😭 * The first time I bought this was in Holland & I fell in love with it. Have not been above to find it for 2 years and I just happen to run across it on Ulta. Bought it now buying one for my sister. * This blush is so beautiful that I can't stop using it. The only thing I dislike is I heard Kiko Milano doesn't keep products around. * Pigment is gorgeous and package is just beautiful and the colors are so beautiful...but why all the shine? Give me some matte or satin finish then I'll repurchase. * I was excited to receive this blush because the color seemed beautiful ""golden coral"" but it doesn't have that much details on the product and when I received it it looked like a super shimmery highlighter. Not what I wanted, it would've been so beautiful without the glitter/shimmer * I am 42 and I can't wear makeup the same as when I was younger. A virtual aid said my color is coral and this shadow is perfect. I can use a little or a lot and it doesn't look clownish. It is very light and silky smooth."
169,covergirl,clean fresh all over dewy tint,pimprod2033619,2597352," * It looks cute for the first little while, but after about an hour it seems to have faded almost all the way...cute though good for tan skin tones * There's literally no pigment. Cannot even see it on the skin. * If you like the idea of liquid blushes but find them overly pigmented and/or difficult to blend, try this!  It's pigmented yet still sheer, and blends beautifully.  I put a little on the back of my hand, smear it around a little, then tap a synthetic brush into it and apply it to my cheeks.  It is buildable, so start with just a little bit and build to your desired intensity.  It applies beautifully and looks completely natural, too!  This is the first Covergirl product I've used in YEARS and I am impressed. * this was hard to blend out and didnt give much color pay off.  wont repurchase * I really loved these blushes. I put them on in the morning and I still have them on when I get home at night after a long day at work. The colors are very nice too, loved more than expected. Would totally recommend! * Bought this a few months ago expecting color...I was sorely mistaken. After I tried it I applied more because even though I extremely fair toned it did not show up at all and disappeared. I'm disappointed to say the least. * I like the versatility of this."

The TLDR of this is that I enjoy the bronzer and two blushes, but hate the highlighter.

The blushes and bronzer are all matte formulas, and then the highlighter is the Super Shock putty-cream like formula. Personally, I never liked the Super Shock formula because I prefer using brushes when doing my makeup, and none of my brushes can pick up this formula, leaving me to do it with my fingers. Okay, whatever. I can get over that. But the biggest problem that I have with this highlighter is that it is mostly GLITTER. I love a glitter highlighter now and then, but not when using an everyday palette for an everyday look. It looks so weird to have matte bronzer and blush, and then a stripe of glitter on my cheekbones. It would be fine if the highlighter was a cute shimmery color, like Lunch Money, but it's very glittery which sucks. Tbh, I bought a cheap Essence highlighter so that I could crush up the ColourPop one and transfer the Essence one into the compact so that I can actually have an all in one palette. Oh well.

However, the packaging is a bit of a miss too. Aesthetically, it looks great, but mine no longer clasps shut even though I haven't done anything like drop it. So it's probably not a great option for traveling anymore, which was why I wanted it… lol * I love this blush. It has the perfect combination of bronzer, blush shades, and highlighter. I like to mix all of the shades onto my cheeks. I continue to purchase it because I love how it looks on my cheeks and the compliments I recieve. I just have one reoccurring issue with this product and it has nothing to do with the shades and everything to do with the packaging. Everytime I have purchased this product the container falls apart so easily. It fails to protect the powder causing it to eventually crumble apart. I continue to purchase it because I absolutley love it but I wish colourpop would read all their reviews regarding the poor container packaging and create something more durable so that the powder will not shatter. * One of my go to palletes, especially for the blush!! I like to mix the bottom two. The pigment is just right and very buildable. Could be used for natural or full glam :)"

The color is pretty but looks cakey on my skin. Not flattering on my skin at all and this will be going back. I recommend fresco from her original blushes. * All That Sparkles is THE BEST, glowiest, gorgeous blush for fair skin. It looks like it would be way too light and not have any pigment, but is so dang pretty and radiant with just the right amount of pink flush. * When I first opened this blush I thought it would be to light but I am happy to say I was wrong. it is a soft flattering shade with a slight glowing shimmer.

Underated blush stick. * Perfect application, blends amazing with sponge and brush. * i was using this perfectly but then it cracked when i twisted it to get more product out would not recommend * I have both the stick  and the compact, I give the edge to the compact...Convertible Color Compact, I love the color Petunia, but I prefer the compact, because it does  have a mirror, both are easy to use , but when putting on creme blush, it's nice to see what you're doing,and make sure it looks natural.
I have been a longtime customer and will continue, just keep  making the compact version!! * Natural look ! * I was looking for a powdered blush of a different brand and was recommended this cheek stick which I was skeptical about buying, I'm glad I made the purchase😊 I absolutely LOVE IT ❤️

174,polite society,go flush yourself blush & highlight face palette,pimprod2040913,2615144," * I love this Palette! It smells amazing and it goes on smoothly. * I was skeptical about this palette cause this is from the Original makers of TOOFACED. I can't wear much of the TooFaced products. I recall buying the original palette in 2010. I know that long ago and those were good. I decided to buy it on a whim, and omga. I NEVER RETURNED it. I shockingly love it. I'm OILY and it stayed on the entire night. I fell asleep with it on and it DID NOT BUDGE. STAYED COMPLETELY THE SAME. If you're an oily  girl you NEED this palette. This formula is top notch. Cannot wait for them to make more colors. And yes, if you're dry or normal to dry, it is going to be harsh on your skin and if you don't moisturize your face well you cannot blend it. However, I absolutely had NO trouble blending. It is not a secret technique that I'm using on my face. HYDRATE and use an oil with your face cream if you need to. * Beautiful shades of peach and highlighter. Goes on smooth and never blotchy. Hope they add different colors in the future…this is a keeper for sure!! * The shades included are pretty but the pigment and blendability is lackluster. It might be worth it to buy it on sale. I am going to return this item and use my Mac blushes instead. * The powders aren't bad, but the Highlighter breaks so easily that I haven't received one not broken yet, so I can't recommend this since it's just constantly broken."

I only reach for this now since buying. * I read the reviews for this before purchasing because it is a bit pricey and everything seemed promising, but the highlighter and blush are both glittery. I was under the impression that the highlighter and blush wouldn't have specks of glitter in them because the reviews said it wasn't sparkly but it most definitely is. It does give a nice glow but the sparkles are visible to the eye. They're both nice and will be used, I just feel mislead because I thought it would give a nice sheen without glitter and I was wrong. * I received this today in the mail, and already have applied it to go about my day today.  It has a great consistency, beautiful color, and stays on well. I never knew about this brand and just ordered this on a whim. So glad that I did! The only thing that could be improved has nothing to do with the blush itself, but rather there should have been a nice brush included with it. * I'm a cool toned and very fair and bought the rose duo.  Perfect shades for my skin- they blend seamlessly and are very natural looking.  Not too sparkly or clown like bright.  The shades look sort of dark in the picture but are not dark or heavy at all. * Love it's easy application , did  highlight my cheeks subtly, love the shade * Nice combination of blush and highlighter. Very natural effect. * I have tan skin and have quite a hard time finding pinks that look good and not like I have heatstroke. This pink, however, is so natural and glowy, just perfect! Love the brand!"

It lasts my entire 12 hour day in the Florida heat too which I love. :) * If you are a Sweet Cheeks fan this kit is perfect for you! You get the Sweet Cheeks blush and the lip pencil plus an eye pencil so that you can create a full look. I love this kit because it's so easy and ready to go in less than 5 mins! * I love that this kit has multi-tasking products that can be used all over the face to create a look!

I was worried it might be too orange on my fair/light skin but its not! I just lightly built up the color to where i wanted it to be. Looks great over the Elf camo liquid blush in the peachy pink color! There is a very pleasant apricot scent to it, so keep that in mind if you dont like scents. Id love to see some more aura blushes, Essence!! * It was a very cute color, especially because I like blushes that aren't too dark in shade. I would definitely by this again, for the quality AND the price. * Love the color of this blush, very pigmented and it smells amazing. Im not sensitive to smells so i like it."

I love setting my cream blush with the powder formula in tis palette to make my blush pop even more. Then I can tap on the shimmer blush to make my cheeks look extra glowy and healthy.

Beware ! * I love the color combo of the blush but the applicator that comes with this is very scratchy and not ideal to use on your face! * I have fair, dry skin, and I had a difficult time blending this blush, especially over cream products.

The color pink is super nice I really like to have that color in y collection 
I think is a nice product for a nice price. I would recommend this blush * I really liked this blush. I received this product free in exchange for my review. The Berry Beautiful color works really well for light/medium skin tones. I loved the quality. It's very pigmented. You don't have to waste product because a little goes a long way and it applies easily with a brush. I think it's worth the investment. It also lasts throughout the day even without a setting spray. * I truly love trying out Pur skin perfecting powder blushing act matte blush. It one of the best blushes I have ever used . It so smooth on my skin . Makes my skin look so beautiful. And color is so gorgeous not to strong but buildable color . Love it . * This looked quite intimidating in the pan but it gives a nice flush of berry on the cheeks. If you're pale like me I'd use a lighter hand, but I think this shade will work on lots of skin tones. The scent reminds me a bit of Tarte powder products. I like the sleek minimal packaging as well. As far as formula goes it's nice and smooth, the area where I apply this blush always has a youthful look so maybe the extra skincare ingredients actually do something lol. * This looked quite intimidating in the pan but it gives a nice flush of berry on the cheeks.

I have mine in the shade poppy and it makes for the most beautiful sunburnt shade. It's pigmented, but still buildable and easy to work with. I love how dewy it looks on the skin as well. This is definitely a new fav. * I love the blush and it's consistency. I was a little scare about the liquid formula seperating my makeup but that didn't happen. It's nice for me since I love less pigmented products * I think the poor reviews on this product were expecting a dupe (even though its not marketed as one). It says ultralight snd thats whst it is, irs perfect for summer (not full glam, not on foundation). Toasty is the perfect blush/bronzer combo. * I really like this blush! you barely need to put product on your face to have a lot of pigment, so I know this thing is gonna last forever. you do need to blend kinda quickly, and I recommend using a liquid blush brush. I only wear tinted moisturizer, not foundation, so idk how it would work with that, but it does just fine with moisturizer. This is an affordable, lovely blush! * I got the shade cheeky and it has a bit more warmth than i expected for a 'blue pink', but it's a super pretty color anyways! it has the perfect medium amount of pigment and was super easy to blend out with a pretty finish. Wore well too * I bought Cheeky and its such a pretty and flattering color for me. I put the product first on the back of my hand then swipe a brush over the color and apply it then to my cheeks. I need to get more colors! * I bought the shade toasty, it's a lovely toasted caramel color. I like that the packaging is bigger than other drugstore blushes in this kind of packaging, and I really like that it has a locking mechanism and snap faceted cap. It's very easy to use.

 However, it didn't suit my skin. I have dry skin and this dries down too fast for me to blend it out, even over a hydrating primer and with the assistance of a facial mist. It leaves a stain, which is a plus, if you are able to blend it out."
183,revolution beauty,vintage lace blush palette,pimprod2007465,2547121," * Great smooth blush and great colors. Value well worth the price * Multi use I like to use the orange for extra bronzing. I love the pink shade and all of the iridescent sparkle. * I purchased this for my 13 year old niece. She is medium toned skin with long straight dark hair. This looked lovely on her. She really liked it! * I found the pigments patchy and hard to blend. Also not really sure what skin tone this palette is for... I'm very fair and the lightest color is still way too light. I actually can use it as a highlighter. The medium two do work for me as blush but honestly on the skin they look the same. And then I though the darkest one would be pretty if I could sheer it out, but since it's so patchy I end up having to use a lot and then it's just way to dark. I think it would be better if they made different palettes for different skin tones. O, and if you're buying this for the glitter, don't. It's only on top. * This palette is stunning! Beautiful, BEAUTIFUL, shimmering colors, and very affordable! * I love glue and sparkling things. I'm crazy about this set because it has the colors I like with the touch of glitter that I love. I bought it as a gift but had to keep it for myself 🥰 * I have a fair skintone, but do tan in the summer. This highlight was exactly what I've been looking for. Beautiful color, and the sparkles are bright and glowing! I used the pink color as eyeshadow and it wasn't too pigmented, but gave a nice glow."
184,laura mercier,roseglow highlighting powder,pimprod2026325,2584989," * I like anything of Laura Mercier's. Quality products. You will not be disappointed. * A photo doesn't always portray a color accurately or how it will actually look like on your face. Looking at the photo the pallet appears soft pink. It is actually more brown on the skin and like a bronzer. Perhaps trying to make it lighter will help. * This leaves the most unflattering tone on my skin. Not universal and leaves a grey-ash cast. I don't like this AT ALL. Also leaves texture. * Love this LM highlighter I use for an everyday simple look I use my cc cream and LM Chai blush and some mascara to complement my look 🥰 * I was certain I'd love this and ordered it sight unseen. Well, ...

Pros: It has a lovely sheen, noticeable but not metallic or Ofra-y, with zero glitter.

Cons: It's not at all the pale pink you see in the picture, and I'm really not sure what the brand means by ""self-adjusting to match all skin tones."" The color is truer to the product's name; it's a definite, discernible rose. My skin is light to light-medium, not fair by any means, and there's no way this could be a highlighter on me. (Thing is, I don't think it's rich enough to work on deep skin. And it seems too cool to be right for tan skin.) Anyway, on me it's a blush/blush topper for sure.

I can't complain about the formula, and I'm sure I'll use it - but if I'd been able to swatch it first I probably wouldn't have bought it. * I had high hopes for this highlighter but was disappointed when, what I expected to be a pale neutral pink shade was actually a midtoned champagne that's too dark and warm for my very fair, cool toned skin.  

Since this isn't available at any store near me, I bought it based on the photo showing a pale pink swatch, the description of a neutral undertone and the self adjusting shade claim, none of which is accurate.  I could tell just by swatching that it wouldn't work but I applied it anyway and saw that it definitely was too dark and warm.  Since I only wore it for a few minutes, I can't speak to the formula or wear time other than to say it's pigmented with a glitter free buildable shine.  

With the level of technology available, there's no excuse for product photos to be so inaccurate, a problem that also adds to the already excessive amount of wasted makeup.  I love many Laura Mercier products but this was a fail and while I think the shade could work on light to tan skintones, it's too dark for fair and possibly too ashy on deep."

I love the concept I get the idea, works really well and looks pretty, but the packaging breaks apart and quite literally is paper. If this was refillable with still a recycled plastic case that you could recycle again, would love it but the paper case is why I might not repurchase. (Didnt even talc was #1 ingrident :/ ) * I loved the look of this blush, the packaging, contrasting colors, the purple color. It didn't disappoint! It's highly pigmented and lasts the whole day. While the color is deep eggplant in the pan it does run a bit more fushia, not a deal breaker though, still purple. The swatches are accurate! * I never thought a brown blush would be for me. I am usually a peach girly but i have been using magic brownie for almost a year. I appreciate that the packaging is sustainable. Mine has been beat up a but after some time but it has not fallen apart or torn in anyway. * I bought Sexual Flufstration and the color and texture are gorgeous, but the packaging broke immediately. This carton situation really is not practical. You should introduce an actual compact and then sell the refills in the egg carton material. Until then, save your money and buy the lip color and use it on your cheeks too. * Bought this brown blush to try out the ""rich girl makeup"" and its a great putty cream to powder blush but I didnt realize this brand was intended to be used as a custom palette. The foam/paper compact is fragile and it broke so I cant securely close it anymore. * This packaging feels like paper meets styrophome. It breaks and falls apart whenever you try to open an use the product. I contemplated taking it out of the packaging entirely but due to its cream nsture crumbs and hair and everything else sticks to it. If you want ti buy this, try it out in person first. Very didappointing. * Purchased this beautiful Color:Only Drama-magenta plum.  Was search of a winter purple... upset over the talc ... more upset that the shade didn't last on skin.  Used with BB Face base, both elf primers, all nighter and just faded.  I'm medium beige to tan and my lil girl whom picked the color is very fair cool and it didn't last as well. Used layered as blush/eyeshadow. May return... It may work for someone else."
186,ere perez,beetroot cheek & lip tint,pimprod2029283,2588787," * I've been looking for a lightweight but vibrant lip tint that wouldn't come off, and I finally found it. Most lipsticks don't last long on me, so I have fo constantly reapply. With this one, it stays in place for a long time. I usually apply a little bit of tinted lip oil on top, and it's perfect. I will be waiting for more shades! * I appreciated this cheek and lip stain for how pigmented and long lasting it was on both my cheeks and lips. I put it on in the morning and was out in the sun all day and it was still very present on my skin and lips when I got home several hours later. 

The stain is very easy to use on lips, but more difficult to use on cheeks. Having largely used cream blushes, it took several uses to get adapted to the lack of blend-ability for this product. I also need to find another applicator to try to use, as I usually use my fingers to blend out products and as an applicator, but this product stained them. 

I do really appreciate the high quality of both the packaging and the product itself, as well as the mission of the brand Ere Perez and this product as a whole. * I used the Beetroot Cheek and Lip tint primarily as a lip tint. WOW did it last!! Initially when applied to the lips it gives a very vibrant coral pink and red hue that is a little too overwhelming for my taste but when I wiped the lip tint off with a towel and pursed my lips together moving the lip tint around it was a beautiful shade that was perfect for summer.
A Tip- the tint is extremely long lasting (By long lasting I mean almost all day with eating and drinking), with that being said it is also somewhat staining. Precisely apply because I found out if I got it out of where it should be applied, it did not easily wipe off and the stain was still there along with my lipstick for a lot of the day. Also be careful on what the lip tint gets on (fingers, clothes, porous countertops, etc) as it is difficult to get off.

The applicator is strong and not flimsy. When applying it on my lips it went on smooth and covered a good portion of my lips with one swipe. As the product is a tint multiple layers were needed to cover the area and have a build up to be an even layer. The product is light weight and because of that it feels as if you aren't wearing anything on your lips. The color is bright and very pigmented and because of that I choose to not try it on my cheeks. I tried it out after eating and learned that it does not fade evenly. My lips did feel hydrated and unlike other tints didn't have a dry feeling. The finish is a bit glossy rather than a matte color. * As someone new to the world of tints, I was so excited to try this. I was curious to see how it would compare to traditional blushes and lipsticks. 

Starting with thr basics, the packaging: it is sleek and minimalist, which I appreciate. The compact size makes it easy to carry in my purse, perfect for on-the-go touch-ups.
Applying the tint was straightforward, even for a beginner like me. The product glides smoothly onto both cheeks and lips. I found that using my fingers to blend the tint gave me the best results, providing a natural, flushed look. The color is buildable, so you can go for a subtle hint of color or a more dramatic pop, depending on your preference. It left mr with a vibrant, rosy hue that looks very natural on my skin. I got shade ""joy"" which i was worried would be too bright and clownish on me. But it turned out to be a versatile shade that I think would complement a variety of skin tones. The texture is lightweight and not sticky, which I loved. It feels comfortable on the skin and doesn't dry out my lips, a common issue I've had with other lip products.
I was also quite impressed with the staying power. It lasted several hours on both my cheeks and lips without the need for reapplication. Even after a meal, the color on my lips faded gracefully, leaving a nice stain rather than completely disappearing.

Overall, I am thrilled with this product! As my first foray into tints, it has set the bar high. The ease of use, natural finish, and impressive longevity make it a fantastic addition to my makeup routine. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile, high-quality tint that enhances natural beauty. * I used this Ere Perez Beetroot Cheek and Lip Tint in the red color and thought it was a very nice color payoff! I've not previously used a product like this so it was my first experience. The product was very liquidy and had very strong, red coloring. I would definitely recommend to start small with application and add more as needed especially on the cheeks as this was just a lot of color at once. I applied dots on my face and lips then blended them out with my finger. My finger was very stained red but I was able to blend it out well on my cheeks and lips best with my finger. I don't really like wearing red on my lips or face but this gave me a nice flushed appearance and looked very natural. I love that this product uses a lot of natural ingredients and it is really buildable if you want more rich coloring on your lips or face! I think you have to remember that it is not a lipstick or lip gloss and adjust your expectations and usage with this in mind! It does what it's supposed to do! Was certainly a nice product and my first of its kind I've tried! Definitely worth a try! * I am a retired crunchy beauty babe. I will always happily use natural based beauty products, however, I'm very tired these days, and got to a point where it wasn't great for my mental health to focus on all the good, bad, and ugly ingredients out there. That being said, Ere Perez really appeals to that natural loving part of my personality, and I was so excited to try the beetroot tint.
I definitely found some pros and cons with the product, and was left with mixed feelings. She's very pigmented, which is great! I on the other hand, am lacking in the pigment department. I really wanted to like this as a cheek tint or blush, but it appears this is either very much the wrong color for me, I lack the skills necessary to apply it properly, or a combination of both. I tried a few times with various tools, and I don't think we're meant to be a blush relationship.  I am curious about using the stain on my cheeks as part of a tantour situation, but I still think the red is probably just too red for me in this scenario. 
Just because we can't have a cheeky relationship doesn't mean we can't work things out! I really like the beetroot tint as a lip stain! I have been in a brown lip era, so it was a bit of a shock to my senses when I first popped it on as lip color, but it made me remember that sometimes a true red lip is what you need. (Plus, a red lip is a great way to say ""eff you"" to fascism if you're familiar with the history of a red lip.) The stain on its own is a really lovely true red. It is sticky for a moment, but that texture wipes off to a long lasting stain. After a few wears, I realized that it will calm down to a more casual dark pink on its own. I would avoid eating a greasy snack while wearing it unless you're ready to reapply after. 
It has a very mild non offensive flavor when applied - slightly sweet and not very beet-like. Also, it was partner approved. Inappropriate comments were made by him, so I believe he rates it 5 stars. I really hope Ere Perez expands the beetroot line into more colors, so maybe I can find the right cheek shade down the road.

187,iconic london,sheer blush natural cream blusher,pimprod2015251,2563077," * I love the product hate how it comes out! * This blush disappeared on my skin, even though I am very light.  I tried to build it up, but couldn't get color payoff.  I've been much happier with liquid blush from the drugstore.  You might have better results with a darker shade than Rose Riot. * I purchased the shade cheeky coral. I have light to medium skin and it does not show up on my skin at all. It breaks apart on my skin then disappears. Ive tried using a sponge, brush, putting it directly on my cheeks, putting it on the back of my hand and no luck :( the color is beautiful though! Does anyone have any tips and tricks on how to get this product to show up and stay on the skin? * Had rhis on my favorites page for a year and extremely disappointed. First use, way too much product came out that i had to waste. Does not blend well, have to use an additonal blush to blend into face. * Perfect finish, can use it alone or layer with a powder blush. It doesn't move my base products around and it doesn't exaggerate my poor skin texture. Ive used multiple brushes to see if it would change the look or finish, but it always blends seamlessly. Highly recommend * I'm not much for make up, so switching to a liquid blush was intimidating but it's pretty easy to use!  You can layer up on how much you want the color to pop, and it stays on an oily face like mine ALL DAY.  I get compliments every time I wear this stuff! 
It's not a crème consistency, so careful with how you squeeze the tube! * Doesn't show any color on my light skin, and so much products leaks out when taking the cap off. Very disappointing!"
188,milani,cheek kiss cream blush trio,pimprod2030332,2590469," * . * The colors online do not match what I received. The bright pink is not as bright and the other two are more mauve and are very similiar to one another. 

Balmy texture that feels completely weightless on tbe skin and easy to blend but I am disappointed with the colors. I'm still on the fence if I should keep. * Balmy formula that sinks into your skin and blends so easily! I use it as blush and as a balm and loved it. Great for summer heat. * You have to layer on the pigment a million times. I normally like Milani products but this blush is a no go, still prefer prestige brands Blush sticks. * I love, blends so beautifully. So creamy! Can add more for more color tone! Never patchy. My favorite ever, all I do is recommend * Wonderfully creamy, beautiful colors * First, this handy little palette definitely gets the job done and on a pretty good range of skin tones; however, more shades are needed! These powders have a luxury feel to them. Almost buttery, a little can go a very long way! That being said, if you have VERY light skin tones, you're going to want to go in with a light hand and build! On the other hand if you have dark skin tones, you're going to be able to load up your brush and apply. They do build nicely; still though too much of a good thing is too much. So while I absolutely love this concept like the many ""multiple steps palettes""  out there, it's not a one size fits all. Unfortunately finding that one size fits all is extremely hard to find in this department; that's the beauty of people being different! 
In the end, it's a fantastic little palette that I'd highly recommend; especially in an MUA bag or any makeup lovers collection that could benefit from these shades. Great price for great formulas. Now let's see more and more."
189,j.cat beauty,blush-mallow soft blusher,pimprod2014270,2564789," * I have a medium-tan, neutral skin tone. The formula is a nice soft matte and it easily picked up on a relatively dense synthetic brush. Thank You Berry Much! is nowhere near a berry color. It's more like a muted, deep coral, verging into terracotta/clay territory. Berries N' Cream is a true berry and is very pigmented. I have to use a sparse brush in order to not deposit too much color. I think it would show up great on deeper skin tones. * I bought the shade Baby Mochi, and use this as an eyeshadow rather than a blush (too deep for me). The formula is a little putty like and reminds me of CP SS Shadows. Super pigmented, super smooth. Would recommend 👌 * Quality is sooo good! * I love this blush and it was so cheap. It lasts really long and the color is beautiful * Its very pigmented and such a pretty color I would definitely buy again. * I purchased Tuti Fluffy and it is a bight hot coral, perfect for deep tones. Unfortunately, i am fair/light and looked like a 🤡 with even the smallest  amt. It feels like a super shock, applies and wears like one too. Very nice formula, just not my shade. Will be exchanging and picking up a couple more. * Super easy to blend and an item beauty blush dupe"
190,physicians formula,butter believe it! blush,pimprod2034051,2592826," * Pink Sands gives a beautiful silky finish to a bare face or as a light brush over foundation. I dont use it as a blush, its so pretty as an all over look. Very soft look for my dry face. I've been using pink sands version for years. * just wish the color payout was a little better. I had to rub my blush brush really hard and many times into the pan and build to get much color on my skin. It's a beautiful shade, though. If you're looking for something subtle, this would be great for you. * I like the color ok but wish there was more actual product. Included is a tiny brush and mirror that will never get used. Too much packaging. * i'm a blush fanatic. i love trying new ones. i also love physicians formula. i had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately there's little to no color payoff. i was highly disappointed. i want to like it, but i'm afraid i just don't. * Pretty buttery and gives a subtle glow. However this shade would only show up on fair to light skin. * I would have to use the entire compact to get any color, barely shows up and my skin tone is on the medium olive side. Dave your money. I gave it 3 stars because maybe it will work better for those with super fair skin. * perfect🤩"
191,essence,electric glow colour changing lip & cheek oil,pimprod2040239,2611070," * I am asked so often as to what I put on my lips that make them look so wonderful and this product is that answer. I have bought this several times to gift and will continue to do so. * The product is great for the price, i use it mostly on my cheeks and it gives me a nice flush, i do think it feels a bit thin on lips but I usually put balm on after, overall for the price its worth it. It also rated good on yuka. * Feels like olive oil on your lips drys out i like the color but not for me * It puts tint on my lips and stays once it's dry. It works better than my $30 lipgloss * I have very pale lips so when I tried out this and realized that it stained very well and very pink it was game over for all other lip stains! It also lasts a very long time and I really recommend putting a clearish pinky lip gloss on top and it looks flawless.! * The gloss changes to a super pretty natural pink color, however, it was very drying to my lips. * As a fair, warm olive complexion, I struggle with finding pink blushes/lip colors that don't look like I'm channeling my mom's look from the 1980s. Even though this turns incredibly pink on me, it's a pretty natural-looking flush.

This product works great as a blush, especially if you're into sunburn or igari style blush application. I recommend applying with fingertips (wash after unless you like pink fingers) or a sponge (which will be hot pink forever after, no matter how much you wash it). Despite the instant, permanent stain on my beauty blender, the blush is pretty forgiving and buildable over a sunscreen or primer — definitely need to be more careful over a tinted moisturizer or foundation, though. 

I don't love using this alone on my lips, as it is definitely a bit drying and has an almost soapy taste to it, but it settles in quickly and acts more like a lip stain than a gloss or oil. I like to add a lip balm or gloss over the top for  a moisturized, just-bitten look."
