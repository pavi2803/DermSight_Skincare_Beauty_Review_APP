Beautifel colors and blends so well * I got this blush because I heard the hype about it, but as soon as you put it in your face it didn't move or blend, it is very pigmented but at what cost. * I will say that this blush is beautiful, but it has a lot fly away. It's meant to be pressed but it can get very messy very fast. It's easy to blend which makes it not a big deal. * It's literally so pigmented so I'd be careful how much you put on your brush but it lasts all day :) yay * Only reason it didn't get a 5 is because the glitter is a little overwhelming to me but other than that I had no problems with it love the shades I got my butta half and it's so cute and girly perfect for a bright pink girls night * This blush is super blendable and almost creamy even tho its a powder. Its very comfortable on the favw which is nice but im noticing that i dont reach for it a lot and thata because its TOO pigmented. Lol i dont usuallt say that but maybe its just the shade on my skin but im aure in other colors i would love it * I'm not someone who cares about the hype wagon but I love a glowy blush and drugstore pricing so I gave it a try. I am someone who has very dry skin that eats makeup. I also work long hours so I need my makeup to last. This blush outlasted my day and that I'd incredibly rare. I was so impressed. And the finish is a bit glowing than satin but without any shimmer or glitter. It's definitely on the more pigmented side of things which tends to make me nervous since I prefer buildable. But it was so easy to blend our as long as you start with a light hand. This has quickly become my favorite blush. It looks so beautiful and lasts through the roughest day. It truly looks incredibly flattering and I cannot recommend this enough. you won't regret it!"

I have goofy combo skin and some fine lines-this blush goes on so nicely and it doesn't make my face look more oily in my t zone and it does not settle into drier skin and lines! Absolutely worth the price and I hope they never stop making this blush! * I love this and the color but it used to have spf in it. Now it's just a regular blush. I noticed the brand has been doing away with the products being spf. Which is a shame since that's the reason I stocked up in early spring. Now since it has no spf, I am in no hurry to purchase. I still miss there spf gloss that used to be this color. * I've been using this blush for over a year now and I love this stuff!  I have dry, flaky skin and using powder blush accentuates my dry spots. This blush gives me a beautiful glow with some added moisture.  Long lasting and beautiful! I really think this blush would be good for all skin types especially dryer skin, a little goes a long way! * I love this blush in the summer when I need a bit of a boost on my cheeks for going out after doing some sun loving activities. I have sensitive skin, so when working outdoors I can only have sunscreen. Due to the sunscreen in the blush this helps being able to put some neutral makeup on for work without the risk of my face getting sunburned with regular makeup. I love the neutral color. Perricone MD used to sell an spf lipgloss in this color as well, I wish they brought back the lipgloss as it smelled great and worked fantastically. * CONS 
1. This blush burnt my skin. 
I applied the blush almost daily for several months. 2 weeks ago the skin on my cheek bones where the blush touched (in the exact shape I apply my blush) got a terrible allergic reaction: painful, red, extremely dry and bumpy. It has been several days of using soothing skincare, and the irritation is still there, although very slowly subsiding. 
2. As other reviewershave mentioned, the cap cracks easily when you screw the top closed. 

PROS 
The shade is buildable and starts very subtle. I have light skin, cool undertone, and this blush looked beautiful. * i only used this once or twice. i screwed the cap on too tight one time and the lid breaks and the stopper sank to the bottom. please replace the cheap plastic with metal. * I love the color of this blush and it blends beautifully. Big drawback though is the packaging. The lid completely cracked when I tightened it. I love this blush but now I can't take it anywhere. Please fix this packaging!!!!!"

Looks good with my pink sticks and lipglosses. One dot is totally enough for one cheek. Lasts all day Love * could do better * i have dry skin and it's hard to find makeup that blends in my face and this is perfect. the price is pretty cheap for the good quality. just make sure you barley put any of the blush on your skin it's too pigmented. * I like it, it's very pigmented and blends well - one dot is plenty of enough so this product will last longer than my other liquid blushes. I will say that it doesn't feel long lasting in my opinion since after a few hours it's almost like it wiped off unlike my other face makeup but maybe I'm doing something wrong. * I like it, it's very pigmented and blends well - one dot is plenty of enough so this product will last longer than my other liquid blushes. I will say that it doesn't feel long lasting in my opinion since after a few hours it's almost like it wiped off unlike my other face makeup but maybe I'm doing something wrong. * I have really enjoyed all the shades I have tried! Not as big of a kick as Rare Beauty blushes but honestly thats why I love the elf ones more. There are so many different shades I truly feel everyone can find a few shades to work with them. Just noting some shades do have some shimmer specks in there. I don't mind, but others may want a full matte blush which this is not.

My biggest complaint is these are a PAIN to open. A very basic and classic, unscrew the top and the plush applicator can be dabbed on your face or back of the hand. These things were sealed TIGHT when I first got them. Every single one I bought I had major difficulties opening the first time. I figured after the first opening, it would be fine. NOPE. These are continuously difficult to open, and I often have to recruit my husband or one of those jar opener grip things just to use them. I'm not sure why these are so difficult to open! I don't have any product caked on the outside that would make the screw top difficult! * extremely pigmented, one very light dab is all that's needed. blends very well with their liquid blush brush. pretty shades"

People are giving this bad reviews for lack of pigment. I personally love a natural look, and this blush will allow you to achieve that but also is very buildable if you do want a more pigmented cheek. I have never been so impressed by a blush before. I was very scared I was going to hate it but im so glad I gave it a shot! The color is so flattering on me while pale and tan! * I have really enjoyed this blush shade, it leaves a nice brightening flush on my light med. skin tone.  When testing it out I noticed it was very pigmented more so than some of the other shades after the reformulation.  I use a light hand in application and it's a lovely color. I especially like the smaller packaging for traveling or makeup bag. * its pretty and the packaging is really cute, but wheres the pigment? you cant have a cute packaging with no pigment. its not worth the money and there is better that cost less. * i was so disappointed when i tried to apply the blush for the first time , i feel like i had to hit the pan a hundred times just for the bare minimum of pigment 💔 * I got the whole  set for my bday i was excited for the blush because the color is beautiful, but is nooooot pigment at all, i had to scrach it with a spatula to get more produc and 👎👎 definitely not worh paying the price… the gloss and lipstick is good tho. * Save your money.   This is thr worst blush prodict.  Minimal color payoff."

The color is very pretty blend well on the chicks with the fingers or a brush bug it disappears in less then two hours.  For longet lasting I apply bit of  highlighter powder or another "" cheaper"" liquid blush. 
I would guess those positive reviews stating that it last long, might be regarding the Bene tint, which is more of a stain according to my experience! * I do not understand all the rave reviews. Maybe a formula change? Because the one that I got is an awful product. It's soooo watery and immediately migrates to the the corners and bottom edges of your lips. You're supposed to be able to layer to make the color more intense but whenever I try this I feel as though I'm simply picking up the layer underneath. It has a STRONG  fragrance and a bad taste when it inevitable gets into your mouth due to the watery forumla. It lasts maybe an hour. This product also gets on and stains my teeth more than any other lip product I've ever tried. Would not recommend or buy especially for the price. * does not last like th girl said * Soooo i am def scared of like stains bc like i get worried it will leave a dot where i put it and i will look like rudolf the red nose reindeer but this blends sooo well like omgggg!!! This is like my fav blush and lip stain everrr!! * This gives you a natural blush and sunkissed look! * Such a good product it is perfect for a non make up make up routine * I love it so much u can make it look natural or change it up to look rlly fancy or a bright pop of color, love it on the lips!

It's more sheer and no color but only the glitter. And there is no similarity. Been using this for many years. Sadly, they reformulated and not retain the color. Had to return it and look at a different brand (MAC) to get the similar shade. * I like how it glides on. * The color is cute but it collects on your skin and makes you look like you have a rash. I won't buy again. * This is not a good product! There is glitter or sparkles in the blush and it ends up looking so weird when you put it on. * I bought the mini orgasm 777 blush and its perfect I ended up buying the full sized product in the same shade because its so beautiful. However the full size is MUCH less pigmented than the mini. Idk if i got a dud or the formula changed or something but it gives more of a natural glow/light highlighter rather than the beautiful blush my mini gives. Super disappointing especially considering the price but it is what it is. Just wanted to write this to warn other this might happen. * I love the subtle color with a little shimmer. The best blush ever! Talc free. * I got ""Orgasm x"" shade and I already have the old one (one of my all times favorite and it's a stable in my kit) when comparing the two, the new one is lighter in color and not as long lasting on the cheeks as the old one. I have also swatched the shade ""orgasm"" in store and it has no pigment at all. I wish they kept the old formula!"

It can feel a little greasy and oily. * I have a pretty pale complexion, so I've been looking for a lighter baby pink shade in a blush, which the shade ""fleur""was a perfect match for, the formulas pretty nice and creamy and blends out super good, but I've found that even when i put a decent amount on, it fades quite a bit, also for me at least, it seems to oxides and loses that baby pink color i loved so much which was the reason i got this blush in the first place, if the oxidation doesn't bother you (which I guess tends to happen with cream products 🤷🏻‍♀️) then i'd say its an okay blush * I love the subtle color and the way it hydrates skin. Over the day it does loose pigment but over all a good product. * I'm not a huge fan of this blush because it's really oily and mealty. it's also really hard to blend out but overall it's good but I wouldn't repurchase it. * When I met this brand for the first time I knew that I would love it ! This blush it's just perfect because it doesn't pigments so hard and it is just looks so natural on your skin !!! Besides it's super nice and preppy !
And it hydrates your cheeks so good !! Love it 😍🤩❤️💕"

I got the bronze babe it's a perfectly creamy and easy blend formula that doesn't leave you looking orange or overdone. The formula appears like it going on dark but with a few stamps of a beauty blender it's perfect! 👌🏼 * This is a nice blush! The formula and smooth and blends out well and the color is neutral so it goes with tons of different makeup looks. I do think you could probably find something similar for a cheaper price though. * This blush lip combo stick is perfect for a smooth, silky, touch of color for your cheeks or lips. It goes on smoothly. It doesn't wear off easily or get weird throughout the day. It blends well with the rest of my make up routine. It doesn't sit heavy in my pores or creases of my lips. It is buildable, so it's perfect for minimalist days of wanting just a hint of color, but can also pop for a glam look as well. Overall, this is a great multipurpose color stick to add it your routine!  

I received this product for free to test and review with my honest opinion. * I received Bronze Babe. This came in a small package, but punches a colorful punch. There wasn't a scent to me, but it went on light and smooth. It has a light coverage and it wasn't overpowering. It can be used as a highlighter to enhance lips as well as cheek bones. I really like this product 👌 * Pur Silky Tint Multitasking Stick in You Go Pearl is easy to use. Just twist, apply and blend. Definitely travel-friendly and also can be used as a lip color. Since You Go Pearl is a shimmery ivory color, it's great as a highlighter or a last pop of color over lipstick. This product is scented, but I didn't notice it upon application. * I received the Pur Bronze Babe Multitasking stick. I took it with me while on vacation as my bronzer to use. I love the beautiful glow it gave my skin. It warmed my face and blended beautifully. The stick is so convenient for traveling. * I received this product complimentary  in exchange for My honest review , this product has been a perfect color for a highlighter it blends easily and the color is not over powering I will purchase again"

The pigmentation sucks and it takes ALOT just for it to just start showing on my cheeks. 

Also, the smell of this blush… I HATE IT! 
I think I hate the smell of it more than anything else. * Love this blush, smells sooo good. It looks really nice but it doesnt match the photo, the shade is off * Love it * worth it. * I Bought it because I Had been wanting to try too Faced blushes.

I ordered the 'Berry Bar' ((darker one)) and it does compliment my skin tone perfectly, which is medium to tan in most makeup lines. I can get A LOT of color payoff using a light hand,  every color has a dewy glow, and lasted thru my 10 hour work day. The only critique I can imagine would be the bronzer not working for anyone darker than a tan skin tone. If you have a deep color, the bronzer may just give you a pretty glow without a pigment.

The case is cute and works great and the product lasts a long time even with daily use! * Love this hybrid gel cheek duo * I purchased the Grapefruit and Caramel color. I tried it out with my fingers and a brush.

The good;
-Pretty colors. They swatch mat but do blend out sheer and become part of the skin. 
-Elegant formulation with a creamy and light feel on the skin. 
-Easy to use, compact and portable.
-No discernable scent. 
-Neither the bronzer nor the blush have any glowy particles. 

The not so good;
-I am fair but cool toned and ALL the colors are warm on me. Why Stila, why? 
-Once applied the blush and bronzer become sheer and the colors disappear as they blend in. 
-I had to do multiple layers before I could truly see any color payoff.
I am tempted to purchase a darker color combination just so it would show up. 

Overall this is a clever, very convenient, and  portable product. Perhaps great for on the go touchups. But it is so sheer and blends out on my skin so much that there is virtually nothing left. * I really like this Stilla Blush & Bronze Hydro-Blur cheek duo. It blebds well and looks so natural. Its not sticky or tacky at all. It doesnt turn orange color either.  Doesnt look fake. * Based on the photos, I'd have shied away from the intense shades but they really sheer out on my light olive skin so I'm so glad I saw them in person because I would've ended up picking a lighter shade (and I might do that, too). Loving the Guava! It is lasting longer than powder blush (even with a setting spray) and is super convenient to throw into my bag for on the go touch ups. I even dabbed some of the bronzer side on in my crease when I was out and my eyeshadow needed a little pick me up. SOLD!!! * Not nearly as good as the Dibs beauty version.

It looks pretty when you apply it, but there is so little pigment that after it dries it looks like you didn't do anything.  And it's so expensive for what you get. * Love the control you have with the color. You can put as much or as little as possible on , either for trips to the grocery store, or an evening out with your date. Highly recommended. Ill never buy anoth bludh again. * Insatiable looks dark in the bottle, but is a great color on a pale neutral face. It gives a pop of color which looks very natural for anyone neutral or pale olive. It is subtle enough for pale complexions to wear without looking garish. For reference I wear NARS light reflecting foundation in Mont Blanc. * These are honestly the best liquid blushes and blend like a dream. 
The color is beautiful and gives a glowy look.
Little goes a long way. 
Do not e afraid to try Insatiable, it's a gorgeous color! Especially for fall. * This blush blends in beautifully and the soft colors have staying power.During beauty steal weeks I purchased another brand. Will not repeat that mistake. * I got this in orgasm and I love it! I have had it a few months now and its become a staple to add a little dewy glow! A little goes a long way. I do a small dot on each cheek and blend!"

I might use it as an eyeshadow instead because I love the color so much. * Glides on smoothly, color is vibrant and can be muted. I am sixty and cannot believe how easy it is to apply. * Big melons is my go to daily.  After washing/ moisturizing my face,  I pop this on and a glossy lip stain and im good to go. Gives perfect color and life esp on the days where you don't want to wear much makeup. By far the best coral pigment I've found (coral is my staple so I've been through many).  Creamy and blends beautifully. * Gorgeous pop of color, it lasts and doesnt fade like some blushes. It is a bit smaller than I would've liked foe the price so it's not going to last as long as my other blushes just due to the size. * Perfect creamy consistency for everyday wear, doesn't require a ton of blending and wears well with almost every product * I tried using this blush with a sponge, my finger tip and a brush and no method let me blend this well at all. The color is beautiful but it's a strange texture. Disappointing as I love most Fenty products. * This blush is beautiful but the main problem is that you need a lot of product to achieve the look you want. For a similar price i would recommend Charlotte Tilburry cream blush."

If you have perfectly flawless skin then you can wear this but otherwise i recommend you stay away. * Has a light shimmer, I'm very far skinned so I was afraid it would be too dark but it's very soft and you can build on it for darker hues. It's light, soft and doesn't irritate my skin. Perfect liquid blush. * Bought from Ulta when it was on sale * Absolutely love this product and will definitely buy it again. * Mine was turned off, and it leaked everywhere. All over my other makeup and makeup case :( it doesn't stop coming out! the tip and cap are drenched in liquid blush! The bronzer I got was the opposite, it won't come out (it's in the on position) and it's near full. I had to cut it open for the product. Ugh. * Love the liquid blush * This is the best version of gloss I've had, usually the gloss I've had are sticky and doesn't have that feeling I want but this one is completely different from the others.

I got to try it out in my trendmood box! * I received this blush in my Trendmood box in the shade Milan. initially I thought this would be too bright on my fair skin, but I used a duo fiber brush for application and it went on beautifully. The color looked nice and I like that it dries down and doesn't stay sticky on the face. * I love this blush stick it goes on smooth & is beautiful against my African American skin tone. Its not over powering or to much. I love the shade Paris it is now a staple in my makeup routine. * Prior to getting this blush in my Trendmood Box I had never heard of the brand. I usually don't like cream/liquid blushes and always prefer powder. This blush stick totally change my mind. I got the shade Paris and it is the perfect baby pink shade for my very fair complexion. The stick format makes application a breeze and this blush has just the right amount of pigmentation. It doesn't go on full pigment, you have to build it up to that if that's the look you are going for. I appreciate that because it makes it a lot easier to use without making mistakes. This blush blends in like a dream and leaves me with the perfect flushed look I'm going for. I will definitely be purchasing more products from this brand in the future. * I received this blush stick in my Trendmood Box and it is a go to for daily use when you are always on the go.

Not only do I glow to the gods but it lasts!! I literally plan on buying them all!! * The texture freaked me out at first, but it's so light and creamy. It's great for my older skin. * At a certain point, I moved from powder to creme blush and I've tried most, this at the top. I apply this formula with a beauty blender and it goes on so well. Application is easy and the color (blush please) is subtle and perfect on my light to medium color skin. My only complaint? I'd love to see more colors! * I was searching for a product that blends easily and stays on...this is it * Bought this on a whim and loved it so much that i bought 2 more!! Blush please is my favorite on my fair skin for everyday, but they're all great! I put them over powder and they don't disrupt anything underneath, and they give my cheeks a very subtle but healthy glow. The blend is seamless and they have great lasting power with me working a 12 hour shift!! Highly recommend, these deserve more hype! * I have used SO MANY different blushes, but this one I can't get over! I got it in the shade blush please which given my fair completion, shows up more peachy. Its creamy, but works beautifully on both bare skin and powder which is why I love it!"

But - and big but here - this smells awful. Like old, expired even? I can't use it because i hate the smell so much. And it is a little smaller than i expected, hard to get a brush into one pan. * zero pigment. i had to build it up like crazy to see anything show and when i looked at myself after a couple hours, the powders were no where to be seen. no staying power * I love the two blushes and the highlighter! They have great pigment and the highlighter sits nice. No glitter!

The bronzer however is not very pigmented. I tried to build it up but it fell short * I really love this palette.  I recently got rid of my old makeup to try to downsize to the essentials only. This palette is perfect. It has everything you need and doesn't take up much space. I bought during the ulta deals so the price was perfect. * Older with middle-aged skin or Sensitive eye areas I do not recommend this product.
horrible red irritation around eye area and all around uncomfortable to wear on the rest of the face. You definitely know your wearing this primer!OUCH!! * I have the Berry saturation palette and im not disappointed. I can use this all over my face even as eyeshadow.

It also is lasting FOREVER. I wear it almost everyday and i swear its not shrinking at all. Perfection. I actually dreamed i lost it and i was so sad so i wrote this review. * I went to Ulta today to replace my Tarte Blushing Bride. It is not the same color. It is very light. I ended up buying 2 blushes. Blushing Bride too light and Fearless which is too dark Tarte if you are going to change the colors also change the name * I was looking for a light pink powder blush that actually stay on.

I got the pillow talk one, and it looks so beautiful on my skin.  It's definitley buildable, so it worked well during the summer when i was more tan, and it works well now that my skin is light. The formula is sophisticated.... It makes my cheecks look glowy, without any shimmer.  It also lasts all day on my oily skin.

I got it in the shade pink pop and it is SO pigmented! * I wanted to love this blush, the color is very natural and it lasts a while, but its trickier than just a quick dab and im out the door, i am not precise on my makeup, i like doing my makeup fast and efficiently. I had heard alot about this blush, it seemed easy and the colors were beautiful, i gave it a try at first the application was easy, but the blending took a long time and i was getting impatient, i wasnt able to build & blend, but at last it set and i was fine. The following day i open it and the product was everywhere. I hate being wasteful but i had to wipe everything off because it was dripping, i had closed it tight after i used it so i was confused as to why it spilled everywhere. Color is gorgeous, the applying is what really sucks and the messiness of it, its hard to continue its use so i just stopped. * The cons about this product is that after one use it will get very massy and will spill and leak out of the bottle.

The blush and highlighter are so pretty and last on me all day * No shine no pigment i was looking for a cute blush set * The blush is far to pigmented for my preference. It makes me feel like a clown. If you like a lot of pigment this is a great choice though!
I love the highlighter! * Personally I wouldn't buy this again because when you use the blush its either you cant see it at all, or you turn into a literal clown. And the highlighter it's pretty but you gotta apply a few times for it to be actually visible. * The blush on this is absolutely stunning and did last me all day. The highlight as well is amazing. Id recommend this * Okay so listen, these are pefect for travel! The size is perfect. The colors are pigmented and beautiful. It has been my recent obsession. Then I started playing with them, individually they are great, but listen, mix both shades of blushes and thank me later! Use the darker blush in the tan set first, and then the pink from the light set on top! Then use the pink highter on top. You're welcome! 10/10 on pigmentation, product value, and packaging. Love CT! * I recently tried the blush and had mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the color was absolutely fantastic. It gave my cheeks a beautiful, natural flush that lasted throughout the day without fading. The pigment was rich, and it blended seamlessly into my skin, providing a radiant, healthy glow.

However, despite the gorgeous color payoff, I encountered a significant downside. Unfortunately, after a few uses, I noticed that the blush caused me to break out. As someone with sensitive skin, this was a major drawback. I had to stop using it to let my skin recover.

In summary, while the Radiant Rose Blush delivers stunning color and great wear, I would caution those with sensitive or acne-prone skin to be aware of potential breakouts. If your skin can handle it, it's a beautiful addition to any makeup routine."

The applicator is a doe foot compared to the benetint brush, which makes the essense application much easier. This is a bit more pink than the benetint, and quite a bit stronger in color. Additionally, the essense one LASTS. I was complimented on my lipstick at 3pm after applying at 8am and was thrown off guard because I was shocked it was still noticable. I looked in the mirror and low and behold, my lips were still completely stained! The taste is not fantastic, but its comperable to the alcohol taste of the benetint. Similar to benetint, this will provide no hydration to your lips. I use the langiege lip sleep mask every night so this was not an issue for me, but if you have severely chapped lips, neither this nor benetint will look good (nor help the problem) as it will settle into the cracks and appear uneven. This is my new holy grail lip tint and ive bought multiple to put in my purse, backpack, office, and home. I love love love it * I bought this because i didnt want to buy benitint but i would def spend the extra money because you apply this product and as soon as you apply it you have to blend it but it still leaves a darker stain where you applied it * I love essence and a good dupe but this isnt it! Strangely thick formula and smells and tastes like chemicals when you lick your lips. I will stick to my yummy rose smelling benetint. Both tints stain but this one is like a scary super stain instead of a natural look. Im so sad this is not a good product even at an affordible price I feel ripped off. * I would say overall a really good product, especially if you like the benetint. Really affordable but it does stay on a little to well. It got on my nose and would come off and it was really bright so i had to put of layer if convealer over it. * Its hard to blend but ive found if you put it on your cheek and blend it with a brush super fast it'll look decent but its just fast drying its also a really bright color so i recommend using a darker lip liner when putting it on lips but its not horrible I just wish it had more shades especially because im a darker skin tone but its pretty good for maybe more lighter skin tones * smells nice * Slightly moisturizing & gorgeous natural color. Long lasting. I've been looking for an inexpensive lip tint for daily use and this is definitely the one! I wear this daily and have had only one issue- the bottle cap doesn't screw on the way it used to. Otherwise it's a great product. Thank you."

The colors are beautiful! The application is a dream and they give just that perfect flush of color! I purchased two shades and showed the line to my friend and she bought one. I do think it is overpriced but, as it should last a long time, I bit the bullet and bought it anyway. As I get older, I have decided become far more intentional in what I buy. The products I chose are generally more high end but, as a I end of with far fewer just tossed in a drawer, I think it is more cost effective in the end. * In love * Pretty color. Does the job. Too expensive. * I have light olive skin and often have difficulty finding colors that aren't too warm or cool. Lychee is perfect! Lasts all day while also managing to look natural. Does not highlight acne texture. The dimethicone in many blushes breaks me out and it's hard to find a product without it these days, happy to find this! It's expensive with the compact, so glad refills are available. * I love this blush. It's a nice buildable formula so it works for a subtle work look and nights out."

I just tap a dense brush in the pot and tap it out on my cheeks. A very good amount of product as well, I'm sure it'll last me a long time. I do set the cream blush with a powder blush in a similar shade, otherwise I'm not sure how long it would last! * I tried this product curious about how well it goes on.   I was pleased with how easy it goes on.  A little goes a long way.  Looks natural stays on all day * I tried the sun cream color and it is perfect. I look like I got some sun. Very natural. It lasted all day too. A little goes a long way and this jar is going to last me forever! Big fan.
Side note: I have light neutral skin color * I'm so glad I gave this a chance. The packaging is beautiful and the amount per price is actually decent. I bought the warmth shade and may try the sun blossom too. It's like a serum/soft cream texture. Blends easily, great pigmentation. This is my favorite cream blush so far. * As an oily skin girl I usually steer clear of cream blushes. I decided to try this one out and I immediately fell in love. I got the shade sunlit and its pigmented and lasts all day. A fresh glow without looking oily * My first time to use cream blush and just loved it."

Didn't go on smoothly - very blotchy and hard to blend.
Price is way too high for size of pot.
Not a good value or a good blush - going back. * I've only used it a few times, it's light but buildable coverage., in a pretty pink! * I purchased this in the shade Velvet Plum during a sale and I love it for a monochromatic look. I use it as blush, on my eyelids as a light eyeshadow, and on my lips. It is a bit shiny but I set my face with powder anyways. Love this bc it's a fast way to do my makeup on days I am in a rush and declutters my makeup bag too bc it's multipurpose. Wish I bought more shades during the sale! * doesn't stay on ..too expensive , returning.... * As a dry skin girl, I'm always looking for creamy hydrating products. I absolutely love this blush. It blends well, the color payoff is great, and you can build the color as much as you'd like. A lot of cream blushes fade if you dont apply powder on top, but the staying power on this one is very impressive! No powder needed, you can keep it dewy and the color still lasts all day. Will repurchase. * Doesn't blend well. Product is sticky and shiny. * I got the pot rouge in Chocolate Cherry. I have a light/medium complexion with a true neutral undertone, and I found it incredibly flattering, pigmented, and buildable. It has a slightly waxy consistency, but it doesn't apply patchy on my dry/combo skin and lasts well, even without primer or setting spray. I imagine this would look good on those with darker skin tones as well. The only potential drawback is the slightly bitter taste, but I found once it sets on my lips, I don't notice it."

The color is gorgeous and it adds such a good layer to my makeup! Would definitely recommend for a buildable easy blush! Hard to miss with this one! * Love the color and especially that there is a brush on one side of it. That makes it easy and quick. * Love that it has the brush and blush in one !! * Best blush stick I have ever used! * I have dry skin and I am always reaching for cream products. I bought this in three shades (soft rose, peach caramel, bubblegum) and although the shades are very pigmented upon application, they disappear on my skin within an hour if I don't set them with powder. This takes away from the dewy look I'm trying to achieve with a cream blush. I also find this blush a bit hard to blend and dry, it accentuates any texture on my skin unfortunately. Will return all but the bubblegum, since the color is so sparkly and fun for the summer months :) * I bought this on a whim during Ulta's 21 days of beauty sale and I'm so glad I did! The color (peach caramel) is a gorgeous deep, warm peach color. It looks great on my skin and gives me that flushed look. Like a sunkiss or sunburnt warmth that's all the rage right now. For reference I'm light-medium skin with neutral undertones. I haven't used the brush that comes with it yet but it's incredibly soft and quite dense IMO and will do a great job in a pinch or for a touch up! All in all, I love this product! Wish I had gotten more colors during the sale but I'm glad this is the one I bought! * Love this Cream Blush! Fantastic Formula. Lasts all day on me. I purchased it in 4 colors now picked up 3 new ones for 21 Days of Beauty. My favorite is the Latte shade it is gorgeous. But was pleasantly surprised by Soft Rose, Pink Dahlia and Peach Caramel. The color on the tube are much brighter and darker then they apply to the cheeks. Highly Recommend these!"

Excellent score for this product! Goes on smoothly and provides vibrant color. Gentle on my skin. Quick and easy to apply, and you can control the intensity of the color. Will stay put in colder weather. * I bought this thinking it was a shimmer lip gloss but after opening it, realized it was a liquid blush! I swiped it on my cheeks and used my regular blush brush to blend in and it is really buildable! The color I chose was super light pink but it gives the cutest shimmer and glow of color! The shimmer gives it dimension and it's easy to apply. I love the look you can create with these! I bought another one the next day after my first purchase. * I bought two colors. Blazing and Sizzle City. The color Blazing barely has any pigment. I have fair skin and I was expecting this to show up pink as it looks in the tube. Sizzle City is a little better as the color is pretty, but for the pay off, I don't feel these are worth your money. There are other cheap liquid blushes on the market that are much better than these. * I got this blush in hopes it would be a cheaper dupe for tarte man eater blushss and i was so wrong. This has NO pigment and thats coming from a white person, all that shows up is glitter not shimmer or pearl. It looks awful. And on top of that its patchy to blend out. Overall terrible product no matter how you look at it blush topper, highlighter whatever it just doesn't look good. I got the shade 10 sun tempt. * My overall rating for the Maybelline Sunkisser (blushes) is a 4.5 stars. I would recommend this is you are looking for a super shimmery, affordable, new favorite blush that looks great on natural skin. 

I was honestly surprised to see so many negative reviews for this blush. I picked it up in 2 colors (03 - sol search and 01- downtown rush) and they are my new favorites, it offers a wide range of shades, all of which carry some shimmer! Sol Search blended out into a subtle nude pink, but left a lovely gold shimmer across my cheekbone. Downtown Rush was a super pigmented gorgeous peachy nude that blended right into my skin. I didn't have any issues blending it out (I typically use my fingers and blush brushes). I especially love this blush on a no-foundation look! 

My rating scale (1- only cons, 3- equal pros/cons, 5- only pros) * Here me out.  It sucks as blush! But its wonderful as a highlighter glow bronzer.  I seipe on quite a lot and blend by stippling with a looser packed synthetic brush. It creates a veil wash of color and has not been patchy unless i put too litle or blend too rough. I love #8 ""shades on"" is my favorite.  Even on my vampire pale skin it gives the best rose gold shimmer.  So while not a ""blush"", it makes a great luminizer! Textured skin may have a problem. But i have had no problem with my foubdatuon lifting if you stipple and glide on top."

I've worn it daily for a few years. Its a soft yet brightening pink that blends beautifully. The product I recieved came in a box labeled ""Love Glow"" and the label on the compact said ""Love Glow"" but the color itself was NOT Love Glow, it was a light peach with no pigment! I've very fair neutral and this shade hardly showed up on my cheeks. Very disapponted! * Will be buying in different shade, very pretty packaging * Will be buying in different shade, very pretty packaging * Love the blush but after a couple months of use cane apart and broke into pieces * This looked better when I tried it in my hand before buying. It's not as great on my cheeks, it's actually very matte. It still looks good, but it's not WOW. Not much different from another blush out there that costs less. * Picked up one of these in the classic pillow talk color. Its a really beautiful blush and a very soft glowy color. It is a little light on my more light/medium skintone. If I was to do this again I would buy a more deeper shade, but I have also used blushes in this shade that had more pigment in them. 
Its a lovely product though and makes me feel fancy, so I do not regret the purchase. * Perfect healthy glow! The color of my dreams! I look forward to putting this on!"

I bought this on a whim because I love bareMinerals products. I was a little nervous that I picked the wrong color; I ordered mauve glow and it's the most pigmented out of them all. For reference, I am a medium skin tone. I brushed it on and the glow was amazing! I swiped once more over the same area to build up the color and it turned out a rosy warm pink, almost like you got some sun. I have to say I'm impressed. I will definitely wear blush more often with this product! * Love this product and have purchased other shades as well * I was so excited about trying this blush. The picture in the ad is beautiful. I wanted a glowy blush. This is supposed to be mauve. When i took this out of the box it looked like a bronzy orange with specs of mauve. I tried it on and on my fair cool undertone skin it turned red/orange. Nowhere near mauve. Orange does not look good on me at all. I wanted what was advertised. Unfortunately, I will need to return this. * I love this color and would recommend it to everyone! * I have a medium tan skin tone so I was surprised that this went on so dark. (It left me looking like I had bruises on my cheeks.) It's a high-quality product with a nice metallic sheen, so I can use it as an eye shadow, but definitely not for its intended purpose. I might gamble on the same brand but in a different color. * This was the closest shade to Bare Minerals loose blush Hint. The color Hint I was told has been discontinued. Liked the loose blush better but this works. * I absolutly love this blush, use it every day and no need for highlighter and the color does show up perfectly but not over power"

These blushes are gorgeous.  I have Juicy Peach and it is gorgeous on the skin, great color for a pop of peach pink on cheeks!   Yes it has some glitter but not a crazy amount.  I highly recommend! * I have a medium-tan skin tone and I couldn't decide which shade to purchase so I got both Juicy Peach and Baked Peach. They are very similar so you definitely don't need both. Juicy Peach doesn't have a lot of base pigment, it is more like a ""blush topper"", however the glow that it gives the cheeks is stunning, like a peachy/gold reflect. Baked Peach definitely has more of a base color, more like an actual blush. Baked Peach is more pink, the reflect is pink instead of gold. They are both very pretty, depends what look you're going for. I would say even someone with a lighter skin tone could use the darkest shade, as I had to build up to get it to show up (aka not a scary blush) * I love this product for the shimmering glow and rich peach tone! I enjoy the sparkle and it applied easily. I bought the darkest shade. * I got the shade Fresh Peach. It is stunning. Perfect for fair to light skin tones if you want that beautiful light pink flush with gold highlights. When I put it on, it just lights up my face so perfectly with a beautiful glow. I love this and want to get the other colors. Can't get enough. * I wanted to love this so bad because I love the packaging. It looks beautiful in the pan but absolutely no pigment shows up on my face. I bought the lightest shade and tried to build it many times and I ended up really just looking kind of orange with all the gold glitter. Not flattering on my light/medium skin. Going to have to return. :("

The color jupiter moon gives you that perfect 90s blush. Almost like when youve been standing outside in the cold and you blush a bit. Thats the vibe here. I love it. * I bought Rose On You and i tried uding it for a few months to really get some use out of it before reviewing. I've tried it with multiple different brushes and it never seems to blend out smoothly. I've tried putting it on powdered foundation and also on top of set foundation. I've tried using different foundations and different primers, but it never seems to go on smoothly. I'll try to layer it up to like blend it out to get rid of the patchiness, but it doesn't fix it then I even try going on top of that with other blushes to try to fix that, but it's like it clings in patches on the face. since I've been using it for so long, I couldn't return it and just threw it out. I definitely don't recommend."

Easy to apply and blends well with the skin. * Barbie Rose Glow is gorgeous!!!! It is very pigmented so only a little is needed. The color looks dramatic in the bottle, but you control how dramatic it looks as you apply it.  The shade is so pretty on. * You do not need a lot of this! It is the perfect glow on mature skin, I have the color soft tulip glow. Plan to buy another shade for a winter pallet! * I love this blush. Its blendable and beautiful and has already eaened a permanent place in my makeup bag. My only complaint is that you really need to be careful how much you use because it is so pigmented. Im guessing between that and the bottle size, this blush will last a looooong time. * Run don't walk to get this blush 😭 it is a highly pigmented liquid blush, so perhaps not for beginners. but it is SO blendable, the color payoff is incredible, the shimmer looks dewy and not chunky (not sure what happened with some of the other reviews) and it gives such a natural look. anyone going for a Sabrina carpenter look will love this line. or you can tone it down.

but no, it's not cringey glittery, splotchy, patchy, I've never had problems with the packaging..I will keep buying this until I die * I tried this blush after I bought it on sale and I'm glad I did.  It is highly pigmented, a small amount goes a long way.  The bottle is a decent size considering how little product you need to apply.  This formula definitely has a sheen to it, very reminiscent of highlighter, thus the name Blushlighter.   It definitely combines the two.  I like it a lot and when it's blended out nicely, it looks very lovely.  I read the other reviews and some people had difficulty applying/blending it out.   Personally,  I take the blush wand and put a small dab on the back of my hand.  Then I get a synthetic makeup brush and dab a little product on the brush and stipple it along my cheekbones and just keep lightly blending.   You can even go over it with a slightly damp makeup sponge and very very lightly tap over the area to blend it out more."

This gives off a very light flush of pink and I normally add another blush with a similar consistency and add it on top of it for a little more color. * I'm really impressed with the Youthforia Color Changing Blush!

The color doesn't last all day but the worst part is the cheap compact/container it comes in. Ive bought this product 2-3 times and each one has broken at the hinges and the blush tim pops right out. It comes apart before i even get to using half of the product. Fixing this would increase my rating but for now id recommend moving on to more durable products and applicators anywaysz * Thus blush is beautiful, creamy, easy to blend. It's a perfect color for fall looks. A little goes a long way and it is buildable if you want a more pigmented look. Definitely recommend setting it with some sort of powder because it can transfer. * i love this. really pigmented and buildable. i did get a shade thats really red for my skin tone, but thats my fault * I bought nude kiss to try out a nude blush and it's perfect! Very natural, blends well, and most importantly, lasts all day. When I bought it, I was worried it would be too dark because I'm pretty fair but it works so nicely on my skin tone.

The color is so pretty and it's long lasting.  It has just enough glow to be luminous but didn't emphasize my texture.  It is reasonably priced BUT there are other products that do the same thing for half price (ELF) so I won't be repurchasing this. * I bought two shades the berry and pink coral. They are both beautiful but im obsessed with pink coral. It is so pretty and definitely seems to blur. Im impressed with the color although i wish it was a bit more pigmented nonetheless beautiful on my medium skin tone. I want to buy all the colors. The colora do last all day. I recommend this product. * My overall review for the L'Oreal Lumi Le Liquid Blush is a 4.5 stars. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a packed-with-pigment, luminous, long-lasting blush. 

I purchased the shade glowy gold pink, and I was really pleased by the ratio of pink to gold, I didn't feel like one overpowered the other. The blush was creamy, easy to blend, and incredibly pigmented. For how pigmented this pink was I wouldn't recommend more than 2 dots for those who have paler skin (like me) or prefer a more subtle look. My only con is it's not a budget buy, it's price is pretty median but may still be out of some people budget. However you get a TON of product for the price so it's definitely a steal.

my rating scale (1- only cons, 3- equal pros/cons, 5- only pros) * This is probably my favorite blush ever. I purchased the shade glowy worth it medium. So pigmented and soooooo pretty. I will most definitely be repurchasing this as soon as I run out."

It has a ""lit from within"" look thats not going to emphasize textute. I got it in the color Jersey which is between a rose and warm nutmeg. The blush is a light wash of color that can be built up, but its not designed for vibrancy. Great for those who want a natural blush thats not shimmery or completely matte. I find the color and texture true to luxury makeup. It has longevity, and stays on my skin through an 8 hour work day. 

If youre not into subtle formulas then this isnt for you. There are more vibrant blushes that costs a fraction of the price. If you enjoy luxury makeup or like ultra milled baked powder then this could be an option. * I like this color and texture * I love this !! Its flirty not to bright not to dark it's perfect for those that have olive under tone! * While I wanted to love this blush, I found the coverage was minimal unless I use ALOT of product.  For the price, I won't buy again. * I love this blush! A nice natural glow feels amazing and last a long time. I will definitely buy again * Perfect everyday blush - give perfect amout of pigment and the packaging is very chic :)"

I got the hot pink shade, squeeze a tiny amount on the back of yohr hand then stipple brush to even distribute. Super buildable and doesnt get patchy!!! * Returned as unusable. Color was not very pigmented, but more importantly, this formula proved really problematic for my sensitive cheeks. * I thought this would be too bright when I first squeezed it out. Using just a little gives me a nice peachy flush that lasts all day. It's buildable too if I want a bit of a brighter color. * Bought ""Fake the Flush"" because I needed to add something to get to a specific total. Its amazingly beautiful, blends so easily, not super pigmented ( with blushes, in my opinion, there's a thing as too much pigment  ) and less than $2.00, I was not expecting to love it like I do. * This blush did not have great reviews when I bought it and that's why I am here. Honestly, this product is amazing and I don't want people to pass it over. It is blendable, buildable, easy to travel with, plays well with others, and has a beautiful finish. It works well with my sensitive, acne-prone, and combination skin. I love this even more than the elf liquid blush, which tends to be so pigmented that you can overdo your blush easily. However, this blush is very beginner-friendly and you don't run the risk of looking crazy. I think it works best when blended gently with your fingertips. A very small amount goes a long way. Added too much? No biggie, just keep blending with your fingertips. One small drop is enough to cover both cheeks, so this will last you forever. 1st layer gives a 'sheer blush from within' kind of look. You can make it more pigmented with more layers. I will be purchasing more colors and keeping this as my new travel blush. The squeeze tube is about the size of a lip balm and the packaging is cute too. This is very multi-use. You can use it as blush, eyeshadow, or a subtle lip stain. An absolute steal for the price. But the quality is great and this is probably one of the best travel/beginner blushes you will find (regardless of price)."

It's a beautiful pink color that's unique to me. I love that I can either have it a soft natural pink or make it a darker pink with applying more layers. * Perfect lip gloss stays a long time as well. * I got this on sale during one of Ulta's big sales as couldn't see paying the price otherwise. The red actually looks orange...and has little color pay off but is the most emollient, long lasting, comforting and delicious smelling lipgloss I have ever owned. Please come out with more colors! Brown, purple, pink would be fabulous. * Thanks ulta 20 days of beauty that allowed me to purchase this for the low to end up loving it. Its my favorite item to complete my new make up make up look. * I have tried forever pink and red. Red is like a bright reddish coral on me, quite warm toned - gave it away to a friend. Pink I kept. A nice, long lasting, moisturizing lip and cheek stain. Dewy/tacky for a bit on the cheeks after application. I have to note that I do not love the scent and it's strong. Fruity. Not something I could use if I had a headache. Otherwise a nice product. * This is a very pretty, natural looking cheek stain in the pink color. Glowy and moisturizing. It is easy to work with. It could be a tad more pigmented and last longer. * My absolute favorite lippie to wear! Gives a great colored stain that lasts all day, it's a bit expensive but it does work really well. It's not sticky at all, very smooth. Fingers crossed Jane Iredale comes out with more colors!"

It's just so smooth and buttery and gives a beautiful finish on the cheeks * I've had this blush in diffused heat for years - it is my go-to. Looks a little dewy and very natural, easy to blend and wear, it also lasts a long time. I recently purchased At Night and it goes on much patchier, never had that issue with the other color. But it blends out ok. These are pretty pigmented IMO, but then I don't wear super heavy blush. It's good for someone who wants something more natural looking. A little pricy. * Terrible product with zero color payoff * I never tried this brand before but this product in Ethereal Glow is perfect. It's lightweight which is perfect in spring/summer but can be used in fall/winter to get rid of pale skin.  I don't need to use much. I highly recommend based on skin color. I'm a pale white girl and loved the color. * I decided to invest in a good blush that is high quality and wont break me out because I have acne prone skin. I love how it looks and it has a little shimmer. * Based on the reviews and price, I wanted to absolute fall in love with this blush. Using it alone, it was patchy by the end of the day. You have to use it as a setting blush on top of cream if you want to it hold. Not to mention, the packaging feels so cheap. Some of my drugstore makeup has better eye appeal and structure compared to this. It also comes with a disclosure to be careful, because it's delicate… Hmm I wonder why lol * I have 4 shades of this blush plus a couple of the holiday palettes, and it is my favorite blush formula of all time. You don't need to add highlighter when you use this. Depending on the shade, bronzer is also optional. You get a lot of product for the price, and there is no talc. It's almost impossible to overdo this blush as it is not super pigmented but still you don't need much to get the job done. There is no fragrance. It's just a well made beautiful product. Packaging is also super sturdy. It lasts all day even in hot humid weather and never looks dry or powdery or glittery. You just get a perfect lit from within glow. Everyone should try this at least once. I have repurchased a few of the shades at least a couple of times. Hourglass does powder products extremely well."

The color goes on kind of light, but other than that no complaints. * I used this product on 3 separate occasions to see if I was having an aergic reaction to it or something else that I was using. I've narrowed it down to this specific product. There must be an ingredient that make my lips itch and breakout. Otherwise, the product is fine. not the best in its class, but I'm sure but the worst. * I wanted something young and dewy looking. This hits the mark! I love the charmed color. It's glowy without being oily like all the odd serum cosmetics that are trending. I'm 31 and was feeling irrelevant/ this blush makes me feel cute. * After seeing this shade (Close Up) on my daughter, I bought one for myself. It's as nice as the prestige brands I've used, and I love the color for my cool skin tone. * I am on my second stick of this and I have to say I love the color and it does have good color pay-off and it blends easily. Nevertheless the packaging is so bad. The cap has broken both times which means it doesnt stay on when its in my makeup bag and it makes a mess. I will probably not be repurchasing a third one if the packaging is not improved."

I apply it with a dry sponge that has a rounded but somewhat flat bottom so my fingers dont get stained. This summer I'm all about the hot pink coral lips and cheeks because it imparts a vibrant and lively look to the face and I can keep the eye look simple with just liner, mascara and a neutral eyeshadow from lid to brow or none at all. There used to be a MAC cream color base called Virgin Isle and I love Electroball way more than that. I ordered the violet one this time around and hopefully it'll look just as fabulous. I'm also going to try it as an eyeshadow and see if it makes my brown eyes pop. * My NB son, 15, wanted to do his face (first time) to go to drag show and loves Pokémon. He's a perfect match to the palest Morphe foundation. I was afraid the cherry red Pikachu blush would be too intense, but it imparted the loveliest cherry red flush and I built it up till it was just amazing.  Now I want my own, his cousin teased that she was going to steal all his Pokémon makeup after seeing how beautiful it looked on. * I got the light pink blush. It is so oily and completely sheer. Trying to rub it into the skin is like rubbing lip balm. 

Tower 28 cream blush is so much more pigmented and not oily. I have no idea why all the products from this launch are so bad, but they are. * I got all three and it seems like its a cream to powder matte finish. They are all sheer and very builable.  I would use a smaller blush brush to get color pay off. Very pretty and natural on the skin. * I bought the shade electro ball and its gorgeous!

It blends beautifully with a beauty blender. The color is sheer but buildable. I plan on purchasing again soon. I have never loved a blush enough to buy it more than once and I usually don't finish a blush before it expires. The formula feels a bit heavy before it's blended out, but after it's blended, it feels like nothing on the skin. I definitely recommend this. 

My complexion is very light. This probably wouldn't work well as a blush on someone with a deeper complexion. It would be pretty as a highlighter on a deeper complexion. * I love this, its easy to blend, nice color, and smooth to apply. But i only widh it kasted longer though, but when i use setting soray it kidna lasts longer. But its beautiful! * First time I've used a cream blush and honestly didn't think I'd like it as I didn't think it would blend nicely. Got it as a sample with another purchase so gave it a try. I LOVE IT.  Blends easily, the color is very pigmented so a little goes a long way, and lasts all day. I think I'll try it as eye color as well. I have the Sparking Rose, I am a fairly fair skinned redhead and this shade compliments my skin and hair beautifully. Will definitely purchase again. * Perfect to keep in your purse for touchups, stays on , also good color choices * Its good luv the color. the only down is that its super hard to blend"

Absolutely worth the price and I hope they never stop making this blush! * I love this and the color but it used to have spf in it. Now it's just a regular blush. I noticed the brand has been doing away with the products being spf. Which is a shame since that's the reason I stocked up in early spring. Now since it has no spf, I am in no hurry to purchase. I still miss there spf gloss that used to be this color. * I've been using this blush for over a year now and I love this stuff!  I have dry, flaky skin and using powder blush accentuates my dry spots. This blush gives me a beautiful glow with some added moisture.  Long lasting and beautiful! I really think this blush would be good for all skin types especially dryer skin, a little goes a long way! * I love this blush in the summer when I need a bit of a boost on my cheeks for going out after doing some sun loving activities. I have sensitive skin, so when working outdoors I can only have sunscreen. Due to the sunscreen in the blush this helps being able to put some neutral makeup on for work without the risk of my face getting sunburned with regular makeup. I love the neutral color. Perricone MD used to sell an spf lipgloss in this color as well, I wish they brought back the lipgloss as it smelled great and worked fantastically. * CONS 
1. This blush burnt my skin. 
I applied the blush almost daily for several months. 2 weeks ago the skin on my cheek bones where the blush touched (in the exact shape I apply my blush) got a terrible allergic reaction: painful, red, extremely dry and bumpy. It has been several days of using soothing skincare, and the irritation is still there, although very slowly subsiding. 
2. As other reviewershave mentioned, the cap cracks easily when you screw the top closed. 

PROS 
The shade is buildable and starts very subtle. I have light skin, cool undertone, and this blush looked beautiful. * i only used this once or twice. i screwed the cap on too tight one time and the lid breaks and the stopper sank to the bottom. please replace the cheap plastic with metal. * I love the color of this blush and it blends beautifully. Big drawback though is the packaging. The lid completely cracked when I tightened it. I love this blush but now I can't take it anywhere. Please fix this packaging!!!!!"

I have tried everything - cream, liquid, powder. THIS is by far and wide the best blush I've ever used. For reference, my skin tone is fair with neutral undertones. I have combination skin that leans more toward dry and I'm in my 30s. I bought the Vintage Peach and it literally gives me the PERFECT glow (no exaggeration here). I'm really picky with my makeup because with my skin type it's hard to find stuff that actually works, looks good, and stays working and looking good. This blush is a teensy bit glittery but honestly it's not very noticeable on the skin and it doesn't bother me at all, if anything it really helps give you that nice glow I mentioned. It being a powder, I was concerned at first with my skin type, but honestly it blends in so well it's like it's a part of my skin. I love it. I'm sticking to this, and although the packaging is small (be prepared), a little goes a REALLY long way so I know i'll get my money's worth. * I should have read more into the ""shimmering"" aspect of this product before I bought it. I was happy to find a clean blush with a beautiful color but the sparkles are too much. Will be returning. * Really like it! * I have used these little shimmery colored powders for years.  You can add them to your setting powder or use as an added effect after you're all done putting on your makeup. Really gives life to an older complex 
 ion! * I love the Bare Minerals foudnation and faux tan. The blush is pretty but… I have acne scars and the glitter excentuates these scars dramatically. It just doesnt look smooth. The color doesnt last either. I notice that it is gone within minutes of applying. Honestly I will stick with some of my drug store options. * I love the loose blush. I have been using it for years but miss the glee color. It was very popular because i always had a hard time finding it in stock. Why did you discontinue? * I first purchased this 10 years ago and have been consistently repurchasing ever since. Im fair skinned with neutral undertones, and the vintage peach shade is the perfect sunkissed glow on me. I've tried a TON of blushes, from drugstore to high end, and this is the one that is my baseline every day blush. As someone who's very fair, I love that this is buildable for when I want a more vibrant look. 10/10"

It's meant to be pressed but it can get very messy very fast. It's easy to blend which makes it not a big deal. * It's literally so pigmented so I'd be careful how much you put on your brush but it lasts all day :) yay * Only reason it didn't get a 5 is because the glitter is a little overwhelming to me but other than that I had no problems with it love the shades I got my butta half and it's so cute and girly perfect for a bright pink girls night * This blush is super blendable and almost creamy even tho its a powder.

I am someone who has very dry skin that eats makeup. I also work long hours so I need my makeup to last. This blush outlasted my day and that I'd incredibly rare. I was so impressed. And the finish is a bit glowing than satin but without any shimmer or glitter. It's definitely on the more pigmented side of things which tends to make me nervous since I prefer buildable. But it was so easy to blend our as long as you start with a light hand. This has quickly become my favorite blush. It looks so beautiful and lasts through the roughest day.

When testing it out I noticed it was very pigmented more so than some of the other shades after the reformulation.  I use a light hand in application and it's a lovely color. I especially like the smaller packaging for traveling or makeup bag. * its pretty and the packaging is really cute, but wheres the pigment? you cant have a cute packaging with no pigment. its not worth the money and there is better that cost less. * i was so disappointed when i tried to apply the blush for the first time , i feel like i had to hit the pan a hundred times just for the bare minimum of pigment 💔 * I got the whole  set for my bday i was excited for the blush because the color is beautiful, but is nooooot pigment at all, i had to scrach it with a spatula to get more produc and 👎👎 definitely not worh paying the price… the gloss and lipstick is good tho. * Save your money.   This is thr worst blush prodict.  Minimal color payoff."

I have very fair skin, and this creates a healthy pink flush rather than advertising fake paint on my face. Love it! * I am not a blush person so it was with caution that I purchased this. I now have 4. To be clear, I like the blush to look like its coming from my actual skin, underneath. I also found the Bobbi Brown blush brush to create this look perfectly while depositing color well. I have had no skin irritation and have early mature dry-combination skin. It stays on all day too. * Dior blush lasts 3 times as long as my Nars blush. The little extra you spend initially is worth it. You won't need a replacement for a long time. It also won't break up on you when it gets low. Nars does that to me almost every time. I love this product. It actually saves you money and the colors are beautiful. Now lets hope they don't get greedy, change the formula and mess it up. * I have the newer formulation in ""Nude Look"", and I love it.  I love how buildable it is.  For no makeup, makeup days it's great because you can make it be more natural looking.  I read a bad review on this page and said it was patchy?  It's not patchy on me at all.  Maybe because of different make-up prep?  I love this blush and definitely would recommend.  Yes, it is pricey, but if you want to splurge on a good blush…. This would be a great option. * I hate blushes that are so pigmented or just don't blend well meaning they aren't natural but this is so cute! Sometimes when I want like a sunburnt look its super natural & when I put it on everyday its super lightweight and it doesnt smudge.

You csn keep it sheer or build up the color. It is a beautiful color in pink. I thought i could get a similar product. No nothing compares. 
There is a slight fragrnce to it but nothing too bad. 
Will buy again and again. * Am always looking for subtle, nondrying color as part of my everyday minimum - tinted moisturizer, blush, mascara. This is my new fave. Simple application, subtle color and glow. I'm not sure about the plumping factor but it seems to photograph well. * I REALLY wanted to love this product. the color is beautiful and I was so excited about the plumping feature. Unfortunately this blush is just not pigmented enough. When I blend it it basically completely disappears. When compared to other blushes out there this just does not measure up :/. I'm disappointed but I did a side by side of this blush and another blush on a swatch test and it was CRAZY how this blush basically disappeared while the other one perfectly blended. not worth it sadly. * very few things make it to my holy grain list but this is on it.

layered over other blush for more dimension or alone for a sheer wash its perfection. 

doesnt settle in lines, blends beautifully with fingers, sponge or brush and totally ""goof proof"". just enough glow with out looking fake. last all day with a good setting spray.

i think Im on my 6th or so bottle/container * I bought this blush last year and all i can say is im obsessed with it!!! This is my favorite blush and nothing can compare. You omly have to use one dot and it shows up beautiful afted you blend it. My cheeks when i use this blush are so pretty and glowy. This was my first liquid blush i have ever used so i was a bit skeptical but i fell in love so quick and i can never find nothing like it. If you arw considering to buy it please do especially you love feeling beautiful and glowy. Im serious i never leave comments or reviews but this blush has change my makeup game 😍😍😍 * I got this as a sample and had to get the full size when I ran out. I love how easily it blends and how easy it is to apply. I don't wear much makeup, so this tube will last me a good while, so I don't mind the price point so much. I will definitely be purchasing again when the time comes. * the perfect color for my complexion, (yellows and olives) its smooth in application and it distributes nicely with fingers only."

Looks beautiful on the skin. Blends into the skin, doesnt leave any patches or streakes. Truly a really nice blush, its worth every penny! * amazing blush!! has lots of fall out but sits beautifully on the skin and has such a great formula would recommend trying this (: * I have a hard time finding a blush due to being pale and not loving pink on myself, but i love this color and product overall. Never thought I would ever be one to wear blush. * I own 3 different colors and am in love with every shade. The finish is a beautiful skin like satin, tons of lovely shades that work on all skintones, stunning packaging, wtc * I got the Fleurtasious (sp) it is a beautiful beige pink and i have fair skin and it blends beautifully. * The prettiest blush for every skin tone. A bit pricey but you do get a bit more product than you would with other highend blush at this price point.

It did not last very long on my skin.  The color faded quickly. * This nudie bloom blush is gorgeous on the cheeks!  It's my second time buying this.  It glides on seamlessly and gives a beautiful flush of color * I didn't know much about Nudestix before ordering this. That being said, I love these blush sticks. Sweet Cheeks is just enough pink to be noticeable while still giving a natural look.

Unfortunately, i was disapointed by the KVD blush balm duo's performance and don't believe it is worth the expensive price point. 

This product is not nearly as blendable as i would typically prefer my cream products to be. It sort of has a cream-to-powder feel due to how quickly the product dries / mattifies during application. I have to really work to get any kind of transition of color because the pigmentation is so strong, and it is incredibly hard to blend with or on top of other products without triggering the following issue; product settling into the pores and accentuates the skins natural texture as opposed to any kind of blurring effect. Incredibly difficult to blend as a result, and despite my best efforts, maybe 75% of the time it creates the appearance of strawberry skin on a previously flawless base due to how the product settles on the face :/ overall, i would not say that this KVD blush balm duo was worth the cost nor could I recommend its formula to anyone who migbt be interested in a blush balm * Ohmygod im gonna BUST. This blush is the best purple blush ever made. * Very pigmented, but also very bendable. Layers well over liquid foundation, or under powder for a less intense look. A bit of a learning curve at first but very worth it imo. * doesn't blend as well as other brands. color pay off is fine for an hour or two and then completely disappears. will not repurchase. * This blush is amazing! Let me start by saying I work 12 hour night shift and some nights I'm very physically active, leaving me with patchy/streaked or zero face makeup at the end of my shift. I live in the South and our air conditioning went out at work on a 93° day. The thermostat read 79° at it's lowest indoor temp that day and after a very sweaty 12 hours of work, this blush was still holding strong! The pigment is pigment-ing (seriously the most color rich blush I've ever used) and a little goes a very long way but it's creamy and still easy to blend out. The balm like consistency is great for dry skin, doesn't settle into creases, lasts forever. Definitely my new favorite blush * Im so happy kvd 💋 I loved its amazing shade and very pigmented stays all day * I was really excited to try these colors since theyre so unique. The red is absolutely stunning, but the purple ends up not being purple once its blended out, and turns more of a fuschia/dark hot pink color. Ive been on the hunt for a purple blush for awhile so i waa bummed to find that this isnt quite it. However, I really love the red as an alternative toned blush. It looks great on my more olive toned skin!"

I got the bronze babe it's a perfectly creamy and easy blend formula that doesn't leave you looking orange or overdone. The formula appears like it going on dark but with a few stamps of a beauty blender it's perfect! 👌🏼 * This is a nice blush! The formula and smooth and blends out well and the color is neutral so it goes with tons of different makeup looks. I do think you could probably find something similar for a cheaper price though. * This blush lip combo stick is perfect for a smooth, silky, touch of color for your cheeks or lips. It goes on smoothly. It doesn't wear off easily or get weird throughout the day. It blends well with the rest of my make up routine. It doesn't sit heavy in my pores or creases of my lips. It is buildable, so it's perfect for minimalist days of wanting just a hint of color, but can also pop for a glam look as well. Overall, this is a great multipurpose color stick to add it your routine!  

I received this product for free to test and review with my honest opinion. * I received Bronze Babe. This came in a small package, but punches a colorful punch. There wasn't a scent to me, but it went on light and smooth. It has a light coverage and it wasn't overpowering. It can be used as a highlighter to enhance lips as well as cheek bones. I really like this product 👌 * Pur Silky Tint Multitasking Stick in You Go Pearl is easy to use. Just twist, apply and blend. Definitely travel-friendly and also can be used as a lip color. Since You Go Pearl is a shimmery ivory color, it's great as a highlighter or a last pop of color over lipstick. This product is scented, but I didn't notice it upon application. * I received the Pur Bronze Babe Multitasking stick. I took it with me while on vacation as my bronzer to use. I love the beautiful glow it gave my skin. It warmed my face and blended beautifully. The stick is so convenient for traveling. * I received this product complimentary  in exchange for My honest review , this product has been a perfect color for a highlighter it blends easily and the color is not over powering I will purchase again"

And can use individually as well. * Goes on beautifully and stays put in my humid weather here in florida.  Love the 3 highlight colors. * Ive used this  since 2016 and i dont think it will ever leave my daily makeup bag. It makes my skin look smooth, glowy and natural. Its talc free so it doesn't settle into fine lines. Im fair so i use the colors individually to set, highlight and bronze. Theyre also beautiful as eyeshadow. Because they're baked, they also last forever. With daily use, i hit pan every year or so. * Stunning glow. Not shiny or sparkly, subtle and beautiful. I sometimes swatch by single color and sometimes just swipe my brush across all 3, then sit back and wait for compliments. Great for understated am glow too. Lost a star bc price prohibitive. Should be an everyday glow product but isn't for me bc of the price. * I'm on the fence with this product. I really wanted to love it. I have to use full coverage foundation due to hyperpigmentation and dark spots. So when I used this, I used it instead of my setting powder/pressed powder. Didn't really like the way it looked on me. Maybe I'll try using my setting powder first then this. If that doesn't work, then I'm probably going to return it.

Do know, the product packaging is cheap. But the product is sublime it looks natural yet adds that enhancement, and there is a slight glow to it. I have found other blushes are really heavy. This one is definitely buildable.  This can go from a day to evening look very easily and the price point I think is good given the amount of product you get and the look that you get when using it. * I was so excited to see Pat McGrath at Ulta! I chose the color Fleurotique and it is my absolute new favorite. I've used it everyday since buying it. I don't wear full makeup & enjoy a natural makeup look & this product is perfect for that. Works well with a tinted moisturizer or a heavier foundation with more coverage. I'm really hoping that she follows this with a bronzer that is similar!

The case is cute and works great and the product lasts a long time even with daily use! * Love this hybrid gel cheek duo * I purchased the Grapefruit and Caramel color. I tried it out with my fingers and a brush.

The good;
-Pretty colors. They swatch mat but do blend out sheer and become part of the skin. 
-Elegant formulation with a creamy and light feel on the skin. 
-Easy to use, compact and portable.
-No discernable scent. 
-Neither the bronzer nor the blush have any glowy particles. 

The not so good;
-I am fair but cool toned and ALL the colors are warm on me. Why Stila, why? 
-Once applied the blush and bronzer become sheer and the colors disappear as they blend in. 
-I had to do multiple layers before I could truly see any color payoff.
I am tempted to purchase a darker color combination just so it would show up. 

Overall this is a clever, very convenient, and  portable product. Perhaps great for on the go touchups. But it is so sheer and blends out on my skin so much that there is virtually nothing left. * I really like this Stilla Blush & Bronze Hydro-Blur cheek duo. It blebds well and looks so natural. Its not sticky or tacky at all. It doesnt turn orange color either.  Doesnt look fake. * Based on the photos, I'd have shied away from the intense shades but they really sheer out on my light olive skin so I'm so glad I saw them in person because I would've ended up picking a lighter shade (and I might do that, too). Loving the Guava! It is lasting longer than powder blush (even with a setting spray) and is super convenient to throw into my bag for on the go touch ups. I even dabbed some of the bronzer side on in my crease when I was out and my eyeshadow needed a little pick me up. SOLD!!! * Not nearly as good as the Dibs beauty version.

I have super sensitive skin and this has no talc! Yay! * I was so glad that Bobbi Brown removed the lanolin from their blushes, but disappointed to see that they now contain coconut oil, which is pore clogging.  I know Bobbi Brown has dry skin, and I feel like all her products are made with dry skinned people in mind, but do not work well for people with oily or acne prone skin.  It's too bad, because I have had back luck with several of her products (her tinted moisturizer contains petrolatum, and clogged my pores).  Please make products that anyone can use! * I bought Desert Pink. It is a darker medium pink. The size was small and packaging seemed cheap. Would be good in a makeup kit because it's small, no bulk, and has a window to show color. It's buildable but the price is too much for what you get.

I'm  a medium brown skinned, 50 year old . These colors compliment me both ways * This is my 2nd time purchasing this palette & it's everything.  I especially like to blend the gold bronze and the pink bronze together. I use the morphe fan brush to apply and the rose colored highlighter brush to blend and it blends the highlighter and bronzer perfectly. Since I moved this product isn't sold in store so I had to order...that's the only thing that I don't like is that it's not sold in MN Ulta stores. * This palette is exactly what I was looking for, the colors are very pigmented, but it is a little hard to blend out well. The colors are fantastic; it has contour, blush, highlighter. Also, I use them as eye shadow. * This palette is horrible! The contour and highlighter do not blend easily at all. The highlighter has very chunky glitter. If I could give it no stars I would. * The blushes in this palette are soo pretty. The bronzers are warm and beautiful as well. Perfect for your kit. * This product is goood!!! I'm an MUA... and it's good for women of color * I have been looking for a bronzer for my deep complexion and wanted to try out a few shades before committing. This palette lets me do that. Both bronzers work nicely for me so I blend both. The contour is super pigmented so go in with a light hand. The matte blush shade is super pretty and I love the highlighters. Haven't tried the brightening powder yet. Would purchase again once I hit pan."

This blush is a lovely berry shade with a perfect amount of  shimmer, adding a nice flush that looks very natural. My sole complaint is it seems to have minimal lasting power, though I have this issue with nearly every powder/cream blush I try. As someone who makes a generous dusting of blush the key point of her daily makeup routine, it's not life changing, but you can't beat the price * I really like this blush. I purchased Rosy Rosewood. It is a lot lighter and baby pink than I was expecting based off the online pictures. I was hoping it was a little deeper and warmer but I still enjoy wearing it. Beautiful for a natural no makeup day! * Goldy cassis and Berry Cheeks are so pretty. They his is my second Goldy Casis purchase. It has shimmer but no glitter and works great on it's own or on top of berry toned blushes. Berry Cheeks is a juicy berry color and it gives a soft glow to the skin, not shimmery but a satin sheen. * I love the color.  I use this blush a lot because it's such a soft color and seems to go with many different colors of clothing I wear. * Doesn't look nice, odd color for me at least but I was trying to find a soft subtle top to my regular bronze blush * Such a natural pink and loads of shimmer and shine, goes on smooth! * Love this powder blush in Rosy Rosewood, especially over the Baby Got Blush in blushing berry. Beautiful lasting combo and crazy low price. Both made in Italy. This is much better than the MAC powder blush."

It's more sheer and no color but only the glitter. And there is no similarity. Been using this for many years. Sadly, they reformulated and not retain the color. Had to return it and look at a different brand (MAC) to get the similar shade. * I like how it glides on. * The color is cute but it collects on your skin and makes you look like you have a rash. I won't buy again. * This is not a good product! There is glitter or sparkles in the blush and it ends up looking so weird when you put it on. * I bought the mini orgasm 777 blush and its perfect I ended up buying the full sized product in the same shade because its so beautiful. However the full size is MUCH less pigmented than the mini. Idk if i got a dud or the formula changed or something but it gives more of a natural glow/light highlighter rather than the beautiful blush my mini gives. Super disappointing especially considering the price but it is what it is. Just wanted to write this to warn other this might happen. * I love the subtle color with a little shimmer. The best blush ever! Talc free. * I got ""Orgasm x"" shade and I already have the old one (one of my all times favorite and it's a stable in my kit) when comparing the two, the new one is lighter in color and not as long lasting on the cheeks as the old one. I have also swatched the shade ""orgasm"" in store and it has no pigment at all. I wish they kept the old formula!"

The bronzer is way more pigmented than expected-a little goes a long way.  Blush too but the overall end color is fab.  Highly recommend for a medium skin tone! * It's really hard to find warm leaning products that aren't too deep, but I found Italian summer is super flattering on my complexion. If you lean cool, this palette might not be the right one for you as it's very gold-based in person, more so than the online pictures. I dropped one star because there is glitter in the blush+highlighter. It blends in pretty well but would prefer more of a natural shimmer. Overall a great three in one palette for a minimalist like me. * Although my skin tone is on the lighter side, I opted for the Costa Rica palette because I preferred the blush color. The bronzer is thankfully not too dark for me and blends nicely. I'm not a fan of the highlighter color, though. It's way too bronzed. I have the ABH highlighter palette so I just use that, but I was trying to find an all-in-one face palette. I likely won't repurchase, but it is an ok palette if you like all the colors. * I love this palette. I have pale skin, so I bought Italian summer. Great pigments and great packaging. * You need this it's truly REMARKABLE ITS SO NICE MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR COLOR THOU.This will get you many to ask what you're wearing and where you get it.  The inside and out it's truly worth all the coins. I just hope it last so I'm able to get a medium one too. This is my go to and will be for a long time. Loving this. * The blush and bronzer are pretty, but the highlight is so powdery, it has not shine at all. Thinking about returning. * It's beyond a different shade in person then here.

The packaging is lovely and it fits in my purse. It's fab! * First off, I really love this formula. It's highly pigmented and blends easily into the skin. However, the packaging has some issues. There is a lot of product buildup around the rim that I have to wipe off with a tissue every second or third time I use this blush. It's just disappointing to lose that much product especially since I really like it. * Great liquid blush. Love the bottle and applicator. Nice color and blends well. I just have to remind myself to go easy because a little goes a long way * very pigmented and comes in many pretty shades. the packaging is super cute, it looks like a rose! the applicator is unique and easy to use. would definitely buy again! * I bought this on a lark, because Benefit Cosmetics' Benetint just doesn't cut it for me anymore. This blush is FAR better for my coloring and for applying. * I like it but, I don't use it evry day and in 2 months the applicator sponge came off .... no longer useful."

Probably the smallest blush ive ever purchased at this price .They smell like candy , the pigmentation is insane and it builds up well . Just didnt expect it to be the size of a pendant . * Inwould not recommend this blue. 
The pigmentation sucks and it takes ALOT just for it to just start showing on my cheeks. 

Also, the smell of this blush… I HATE IT! 
I think I hate the smell of it more than anything else. * Love this blush, smells sooo good. It looks really nice but it doesnt match the photo, the shade is off * Love it * worth it. * I Bought it because I Had been wanting to try too Faced blushes. Its super pretty and really easy to blend. its also very buildable I also love the packaging too. I think its really good purchase if you are wanting a more higher end blush. Minus one star because its low key expensive lol * Pigment! It stays on and doesn't break me out. I love them. They're so underrated.  Finally found a loud pink that doesn't go ashy!

I did not break out from this blush. * I ordered this small size to try and I love it! I have finally found a blush that I love and looks perfect on me. When I am done with this mini, I will order the larger, regular size compact. Sometimes I like to take my brush and get all 3 colors on it and use it like that and it gives a pretty glow to the look. It stays put all day and I recommend it! 5 stars! ⭐️ * I absolutely adore this product and it's versatility. It's my go-to travel blush. I pair it with Rare Beauty 'Hope' liquid blush or wear it on its own.  I love that it has three shades to create a custom look on my cheeks, but when I need to move fast, I use all of them all at once for a pretty soft glow blush.  I view its small size as a complete bonus.  It's absolutely perfect. * I love this color! I had been wearing the color mocha from Chanel for years and years and out of nowhere they discontinued it and nobody knew why because it was such a unique color then I switched to our oasis also discontinued so I found this and I feel like it's very similar I'm just wondering if it's going to stay on and where as well as the other two did! I really hope this doesn't get discontinued. I'm gonna buy a few more and I wish it came in a larger size. I do not feel like the her eyeshadows wewr well even w primer so im crossing my fingers that the blush stays on better! * As a ND collector this one was a miss for me, although the mini pallet in this series was great. This pulled really orange on my fair cool pink undertone. I also found the size of it impractical for having 2 blushes and a highlighter in it. I knew it was mini and that wasn't the issue, I just think it could/should have been JUST blush and it would have been great. But that highlight mixed in wasn't it for me. * I was hoping for a cool toned blush, but this ended up being more of a soft warm clay color on me than the more pinky mauve it appears to be. It wasn't working for me. The highlighter was cute, but I didn't think that or the blush had the best staying power considering the price. They aren't that bad, but just not my style, so I returned this item. The mini eyeshadow palette is a keeper, though! * If you want a pretty blush with a sheen, this is a good option. Just be aware, if you want that pinker tone (esp for us paler types) this isn't that. It's more of a rusty red tone, with a light gold highlight."

I got this instead and I like it so much more. Its not too warm, just right. Im extremely fussy about blush shades and this is the perfect pink. I dont have to build up the color at all like you have to with the dragon palette. It just looks good on the first go. My makeup is taking less time in the morning since everything is in one palette. Use a light hand with the highlighter as its very shiny/pigmented. * if you are a beginner in makeup, this would be perfect for you, the options r amazing and you can really experiment * I really want to gatekeep this product but its just too good i love it so much and it smells amazing i love the pigment and the formula * Its meant for white skin. The onlt thing that look slightly okay on me was the glowy blush. It was also quite patchy. Sad bc i really like physian formula * Surprising buildable coverage and the shades aren't as deep as I thought they would be. I definitely do NOT recommend this for anyone with medium + skin, as the bronzers wouldn't work, so it wouldn't be an effective use of money :/. Otherwise, it's gorgeous and I'm really excited to use it. * Im obsessed.  Love this product, buildable but also pigmented.

Its not over powering or to much. I love the shade Paris it is now a staple in my makeup routine. * Prior to getting this blush in my Trendmood Box I had never heard of the brand. I usually don't like cream/liquid blushes and always prefer powder. This blush stick totally change my mind. I got the shade Paris and it is the perfect baby pink shade for my very fair complexion. The stick format makes application a breeze and this blush has just the right amount of pigmentation. It doesn't go on full pigment, you have to build it up to that if that's the look you are going for. I appreciate that because it makes it a lot easier to use without making mistakes. This blush blends in like a dream and leaves me with the perfect flushed look I'm going for. I will definitely be purchasing more products from this brand in the future. * I received this blush stick in my Trendmood Box and it is a go to for daily use when you are always on the go.

The feel of this on my skin was very heavy and if you are looking for light weight, I would not recommend it. This blush really disappointed me. The packaging was also horrible.

(It takes a bit of force to apply but with the right blending brush, it's PERFECT!) * The quality of the product is an absolute steal for the price. I surprisingly loved this item more than I expected too. It is very buildable and his a good amount of pigment in it. * I am so genuinely surpised. It's easy to blend, it wears beautifully, can be built up for more color impact (but is actually kind of natural sheered out), and smells so good. It smells like a watermelon jolly rancher. So if you don't like fragrance, keep that in mind. 

This is exactly what I was looking for. Only minor complaint is that it can pick up base products if if applied directly to face. I suggest using a brush to stipple it on."

So confused why the reviews are bad bc this palette is gorgeous. the highlighter is pretty, and the bronzer is quite pigmented. Nothing too special- the blush is def a game changer tho. * I really wanted a cheek palette to cut down on clutter in my makeup bag. I was sorely disappointed to learn this wasn't it. The highlighter is just glitter. Way too coarse of a glitter than I prefer for a highlight. It looks nice as a shadow. The blush is more of a highlight, it's very iridescent. I learned that I prefer matte blush after using this. The bronzer warmed up my light complexion nicely but it does not make a good contour color; I use it more for a sun kissed glow. There is a lot of fall out from this palette.  It is usable but not as I intended it."

Too orange, especially the eyeshadow. * I love a good all-in-one face palette for my makeup on the go bag. This drugstore version had what I need. However, the bronzer is a little too yellow for my fair skintone, the shadows are pinky (personally, I would love a more neutral trio that I van use for day-to-night), and I would trade the shimmery blush for a contour shade or a matte highlighter shade. My opinions are based on the fact that I use this for an everyday palette on-the-go and not for a certain look. * I use this daily and does not break me out!! * I really like this product. I like using a cream blush underneath and then one of these on top to set it. You can't beat the price and the quality is very good. * I wish they would make more all-in-one palettes like this. It is good quality, and flattering shades. Please make more! * The bronzer made me look orange and the eyeshadow falls off of my face, same with the sparkles from the sparkly blush but the highlighter is amazing and the blush is very pigmented. * I thought this would be a fairly large sized face palette, but its tiny! Its like a mini face palette. This is what makes it great for travel, which is how I'll probably use it. 

The eyeshadow colors are flattering peachy-pink-terracotta shades, very pretty for summer. The texture is lovely and easy to blend. The slightly larger blush, highlight and bronzer are good quality and fairly pigmented as well."

I love it and its lasted me for a long time now. * Altjough the pan is a big size for the money every color is very orange.

I had never dropped it would treated it roughly. I think its just not pressed hard enough. The sales associate said they had already had a few returned for the same reason ☹️☹️☹️ * Love this item- very versatile, has staying power, and a hint if shimmer. * I bought it in place of the bare minerals bronzer because they were out. It's not even close to the same. With this one a little goes a long way and it's too orange for my skin. * not a great powder and has a weird smell"

5* for Morphe

I'm tired of always having my shade range available online only. Beautiful palette, bold colors, and deep enough for the darkest skin tones. 

I just hate the fact that I have to wait days in order to get my shade most of the time. In addition to me having to purchase multiple shades in order to find my exact one. 

This is so frustrating and I hope Ulta stops this practice. * I love the colors and tones it gives my face. It takes the guess work out"

The color is very pretty blend well on the chicks with the fingers or a brush bug it disappears in less then two hours.  For longet lasting I apply bit of  highlighter powder or another "" cheaper"" liquid blush. 
I would guess those positive reviews stating that it last long, might be regarding the Bene tint, which is more of a stain according to my experience! * I do not understand all the rave reviews. Maybe a formula change? Because the one that I got is an awful product. It's soooo watery and immediately migrates to the the corners and bottom edges of your lips. You're supposed to be able to layer to make the color more intense but whenever I try this I feel as though I'm simply picking up the layer underneath. It has a STRONG  fragrance and a bad taste when it inevitable gets into your mouth due to the watery forumla. It lasts maybe an hour. This product also gets on and stains my teeth more than any other lip product I've ever tried. Would not recommend or buy especially for the price. * does not last like th girl said * Soooo i am def scared of like stains bc like i get worried it will leave a dot where i put it and i will look like rudolf the red nose reindeer but this blends sooo well like omgggg!!!

The deeper rose shade is good for summer into fall. * I bought the red blush because it's trending, and it is so perfect. I brush it across my cheeks and over my nose for a sunburned effect, it's gorgeous. I had never used cream blush before. It's actually not that messy or inconvenient, and it doesn't feel greasy. Easy to get used to. * I was disappointed that that the color was more brown than pink. Also that it was very light in pigment. I needed to apply several layers before I saw any blush on my cheeks. 
My friend also bought this product but in a different shade. She had the opposite effect. Her tint, which was a bright pink, deposited too much color. * Product works well on my skin. Product does what it advertises to do * I have just recently started using cream blushes. The one in my current rotation is Rare Beauty's Vulnerable Melting Blush. I like it, however, it began pulling my foundation underneath. I also wanted a bit more pigment. I decided to go with Charlotte Tilbury's Lip and Cheek Glow. Oh my goodness it is so pretty. Every time I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I see how glowy this blush is. It looks even better with a highlighter. I am pretty fair, so I chose the shade Pillow Talk Colour of Dreams. This is exactly the shade I was looking for. The right amount of pigment to where I don't look bare or look like a clown. This is now my go-to blush for a no makeup-makeup look or full glam. * I've tried many cream/liquid blushes and this made it to holy grail. Usually terracotta works best for me but this is unique.  I think soft brick may be close.  It's more neutral than it looks. 
Blends easily with brush or sponge. Apply and look like a goddess. * Color: warm rosebud pink

Okay so I saw how this looked in the photos on the model and I had to try it. I am fair skinned and I love it! I am a blush girlie so this is great for me. I look sickly without blush. 

It applies very easily. The only thing I will say is sometimes all I want to wear is blush and in that instance I dont think it stays put as well/as long. I try to pair it with a little primer or a tiny bit of foundation and thats the perfect light every day look im going for."

However, I love this palette for it's own reasons, which I listed above. * I would get this if you are scared of very pigmented blushes the contours are nice and creamy but not the blushes and the blushes have glitter. The highlight is nice and creamy as well. * All creams to use for cheeks eyelids and wherever i want a glow or highlight. Purchased on the half off sale . will use for travel . Its nice * you over age 60 ladies dont shy away from this product i own it  and it is pretty awesome ! i wear on cheeks sculpt bronze  highlight even uae as a natural eyeshadow with beautiful dark brown liner ! * I'm 45 - at this time in my life - my goal is to to keep my makeup routine between 5-10 minutes.  

This product was a good buy.  You can build it up to your liking, and it's very forgiving - just blend it out.

I imagine if you take good care of yourself and hydrate, the sky is the limit as far as how beautiful it looks on the skin.  

The blushes are not heavily pigmented, but are still lovely.  If I need a little extra, Tower 20 or Natasha Denona blushes work well. * wanted to love this palette. the colors are beautiful but there's too much glitter and not pigmented enough. doesn't last. * Terrific cream bronzers and blushes!!

The eyeshadow isn't really a usuable on its own. Pigmentation is pretty poor all across the board. * I have been loving the oh so nudie stack to do my makeup on the go. The top is a buildable shimmery eyeshadow, the second layer works as a bronzer/blush combo on my fair skin, the lip balm adds a faint swipe of color, and the highlighter is nice. * So I got the Oh so Nudie stack on sale one day and gave it a shot even though I'm not a morphe fan. This killed it. The eyeshadow is especially good and super flashy and looks really pigmented when applied correctly. The blush is flattering for my tanner skin tone it's like the perfect blush and bronzer mix. But my fav is the face highlight balm, it's the best highlight ever. It's so flattering and real looking. No powder glitter or pigments that look good in one angle and terrible in the other. This is just a clear balm that doesn't rub in and disappear like others I have tried like this. It looks really good on their hint hint skin tint which I'm loving as well and use every day since it is the perfect oil free which is a must yet glowy foundation tint. Morphe2 is definitely doing it for me which is nice to find out because now that I see these other stacks I kind of need them... * I love the stacking idea but I'm can't decide if I love the product or not. I have the ""Violet Vibes"" version. The top layer is a very light pink eyeshadow with sparkles. it feels a bit chalky but it's alright. The second is a sparkly blush, again, a bit chalky and I don't love that it's sparkly but it's alright. The third layer is a berry colored lip product with a slightly sticky chapstick type consistency, which is nice but difficult and messy to apply without an applicator. The final one is almost like a glitter balm with chunky glitters. Definitely a bit of an oddball choice but can be fun on certain occasions. I would probably recommend this to a friend but the bottom two are a bit inconvenient and I do wish the powders were more buttery and high-quality feeling. * Wanted to love this. It's compact for travel, that's about all the props I can give it. It's cheaply made and should be sold as makeup for little girls to play in. Not impressed at all. Will be returning it . * The colors are perfect and exactly what I wanted, a warm yellow tan but the problems are the lip gloss tastes terrible like perfume and the eyeshadow irritated my eyes as soon as I put it on. I'm pretty sure a lot of that was because of the glitter fall out. I do have sensitive eyes so who knows. The gloss smells nice but doesn't taste nice unfortunately. There's pretty much no color which could be overlooked if it tasted better and was moisturizing. The blush is pretty sheer which I prefer a buildable blush so that's ok and the highlight is sheer with no color to it which is also ok because it looks more natural. All in all I would not repurchase this and have no desire to try other colors. * I've bought around 3 of these because I truly love the product in itself. It's convenient, pretty, and easy to use especially when it's a quick day or I'm travelling with it. the only big downside from me that's disappointing is the top glitter keeps breaking and falling out, in which glitter then gets everywhere. It's again a nice product besides that and it's making me hesitant to buy again as I'd like to not have to clean up a glitter mess for once"

Very pigmented but it's also a buildable coverage. You can create a natural flush with this blush, without appearing too heavy or patchy; OR, you can build it up for a dramatic look. There is some fall out as expected, but other than that, highly recommend! * So amazing for the price!!! High quality. Pigmented yet blendable and it lastss!! So so niceee esp for the price would def reccomend!! * The color is a little sharp..but it definitely lasts longer than any other powder blush I've tried in the last few years * I took away 1 star because it's so pigmented. I've learned to work around it, but I know that a lot of people don't really care for that much pigment. The Rosewood color is gorgeous. It gives a very smoothing effect to the skin. The Infallible line is top notch. * Decided to give this blush a shot (in the shade fearless coral) and it does not dissappoint! I use a kabuki brush to apply.. which picks up quite a bit so I go ahead and dab a few dots of foundation on top right after with a beauty blender so just the right amount shines through 🩷 * Get the 10 i love it !!

They aren't easily blendable and dry down super quick. I normally love NYX, but i think they just used their matte liquid lipsticks and put them in a blush tube! * I love this blush. I purchased this blush twice already. I love how it settles on my skin, I like the color payoff. Its a good blush. The only thing that could be different is if they made some natural finished blushes with a similar formula. * I got this product in the advent calendar in the very dark color, Bombshell and as a fair skin toned girlie I instantly thought oh no, this is not for me. Boy was I wrong!! This stuff is extremely versatile! It sheers out in a way that makes it usable for me but can be built up enough to work for others. The blendability on this is magic, way better than any other liquid blush ive tried. The glow on thjs is beautiful. Something I thought wouldnt work for me is now my new favorite and I cant wait to buy other colors!! * This is honestly one of my favorite blushes.
I have dry/mature skin with some texture, and blends beautifully and stays put.  
The doe foot applicator is chef's kiss.  I tap a couple spots and blend with a brush! * My favorite blush! Ive tried so many blushes but this is forever my favorite. The texture is so nice, it blends beautifully into my skin instead of just sitting on top like a lot of blushes tend to do. I only need one swipe on the back of my hand to cover both cheeks! * This stuff is so perfect. Its the best liquid blush in my collection and i will always come back for more when i run out. I wear it everyday and if you are cool toned and fair skinned like me coralicious is the best blush tint. Looks so natural. * I have two shades of this formula but Nude-tude is by far my absolute favorite! Its a perfect nude slightly brown mauve. Its blends beautifully on to my 50yr old cheeks!

I dont know if its because my blush came a little melted or thats just the formula. It could also be quality control because I see that in reviews from this brand in other products. Overall, I like the product. I didn't experience any patchiness or color fading. It's better to tap this product in than smear it. I have combination/oily acne prone, textured, skin and it lasted on my skin without any problems. * I am an advid makeup collector and have MANY cream blushes in my collection. These are definitely some of my absolute favorites! I own teddy, bubble gum and Jam and they are all beautiful but jam and teddy are something else! Out of all the blushes i own im always reaching for those 2 specifically. I have fair to light skin and teddy is the absolute best neutral everyday blush that goes with every make up look. Jam is also fabulous. It looks like a natural berry flush on the cheeks. Super blendable and creamy and i love how most of them have a matching powder blush to set with * Love, love this blush! So pigmented and melts easily * Perfect tones, pigmentation is there and you could never overdo it, blends like a dream, easily buildable, smooth application * this has becone my holy grail blush as someone with intensely dry skin. i cannot use powders at all because they suck the moisture out of my skin and have me looking dry, cakey, and flakey all day. this blush is INCREDIBLE. the texture is BUTTER and the color payoff is ridiculously good. easy to swipe on and go for a low-key day, but my favorite means of application is to use a brush across the stick and buff onto my cheeks. given the intense color payoff, a light hand in many layers has proven far more effective if i'm looking for a polished, diffused, ""is-she-wearing-makeup?"" blush. my tried and true is layering teddy like a bronzer with a touch of the cherry color on top. will buy in more colors if they come back in stock!! * Wanted to love this, but it fades in about one hour. Color was nice but I prefer other cream blushes. * I got this in the shade teddy after having it in my cart for a while, and i LOVE it so much!!! The shade is the perfect blush / bronzer medium, and it is the most easy to blend blush i have ever tried (i also use merit, rare beauty, patrick ta) nothing is as smooth and blendable as this!!!

The balm is perfection and the cream blush needs a dab to pick up pigment. The highlight is chefs kiss and I'm not a daily highlight person, but I've work this one every day since I got it. * Love this palette so much. The pigment is so beautiful and gives you that perfect berry tone. The higher lighter is also so perfect and a formula like no other!

Pass. * I really like the pocket size * The highlight is not that great in my opinion.  The color is meh, nothing special.  I absolutely love the bronzer and the blush is pretty.  These are small for the price but it's a nice way to sample unfamiliar product.  I would definitely recommend buying a full size of the bronzer or blush!  So easy to blend, beautiful and looks great all day!  Also wanted to mention my inside mirror was chipped and both kits that I purchased!!! * Great shades to enhance your look * This is my first time trying any products from NUDESTIX. Im no stranger to cream products, however. I trally, really like these! The colors look great on my skin tone, which is somewhere around ""medium"". I find the best way to apply these products is by rubbing a makeup brush right over the top of the product, rather than applying directly to my face. The colors and finish is so pretty. Its natural looking, yet not so much that it just blends away. Seems to last a relatively long time, as well. I will definitely be purchasing more from this brand."

Found it recently and now I have color again! Works great on 80 y/o skin too! * I have fair skin, so I was a little nervous at first when trying this....but it's GORGEOUS!!! * This is sooo pretty on the skin. The only reason I took a star off is because it's actually quite powdery, but I was expecting it to be more buttery like the other bronzers. Either way, it's super pretty."

Obviously purchased it because I can apply it, keep my hands clean and not have to carry around in additional brush or beauty blender. * First time buyer of this product; love love everything about it. The packaging, color and type selection.

Application is great too * I decided j wanted to try a blish stick instead of powder so I chose this one and im so glad i did! Ive had this blush for about a year now and i still have plenty left! I would definitely recommend! * I have oily skin…really oily, so I wasn't really expecting it to last all day.  I was surprised!  I put it on, great blendability, perfect amount of pigment, and the color, ""juicy melons"" is stunning…. But I went on a hike that day and walked around in the sun, and when I got home it still looked great.  Awesome blush.  Definitely going to pick up more shades and I definitely recommend to anyone. * I am an avid cream blush user and have tried many different brands. I decided to give this a try after hearing a lot of good things about them, but I unfortunately did not like it. The longetivity isn't the best, even for being matte - the minute you rub your face it's gone (even when I set with powder blush on top). It's unfortunate because I loved the natural color it gives and that it's buildable, but I can't justify the price for the lack of lasting power. Maybe if you like to wear very light makeup and don't care for your blush not lasting long would I get this (even then there's better for less $$$, such as the elf putty blush) * I bought this during the 21 Day promotion.  I wanted to try but a bit pricey but on sale i will try.  I was skeptical but I will say I love this product.  Im older with typical challenges we older girls face.  This product goes on smooth. Blemds beautifully and lasts all day.  I love it.  Really great product. * I was so excited go try this when i saw influencers using it so i immediately purchased during the 50% off sale. The packaging and brush tip is cute but its almost impossible to get the blush to blend out and i feel like it could easily mess with whatever makeup you have on underneath. The mirror also came cracked. Other blushes are cheaper and more blendable with better color pay off, i returned and bought a rare beauty blush instead and i'm much happier"

This another disappointment in recent years with changing once elegant classy formulas and packaging to cheap glitter makeup with flimsy packaging. I was hopeful the color mist would be a replacement for my beloved in touch cream blush in clarity but no way!!! This reminds me of something I would see in my 3 year old daughters play makeup kit. The glitter in this is beyond overwhelming and actually makes skin look drier. Please bring back in touch cream blush . I think it might be time to move on and find a new makeup brand for my needs. * Disappointed, too much gliter and doesn't blend well. * I got Glorious and am relatively fair, and I love it. It doesn't last super long, but it's easy to re-apply. I like to put it on even when I don't have other makeup on (like when I just woke up or go for a walk or whatever) for just a natural slightly flushed look. I was worried it would be too dark or too glittery for me, but it's not. Love it!"

But if you want more vibrant and just smoth blushes then maybe save uour money and buy a better pallatte but if your trying yo save a coin and just want multiple blushes that arent bad then go ahead * Pros:
Great variety of blush shades, all in wearable colors.
Great for fair to medium skin tones (neutral/olive/warm undertones mostly)

Cons:
The wear time is average.
This palette def wont work for deep/deepest skin tones.
May not be flattering on cool tone skin. * Affordable and beautiful * love love love the dofferent shades of colors, plus very essy to apply * Really love this blush set! I am a fair skin woman so I am not sure if it would be as pigmented for my darker complexion pals but if you are fair skin it works well. Blushes are blendable and enjoy that I am able to switch my blush around each day. * If your lookihg for a budget friendly blush palette this one is the one you should get!

I tried the shade mauveulous and it was not smooth on the skin. Just kinda sat weird and didnt blend. Returned. * Ive tried to apply this about 5 times and theres no pigment and it falls out so much. Such a waste of a product * I was so sad when Too Faced discontinued ""your love is king"" and I finally discovered ""Mauvilous"" is nearly identical! It's a very bright purple-toned pink. Very pigmented and can be a little tricky to blend without foundation, but brushing over it with a little translucent powder helps. * This blush is so pigmented.

Pat it on. It looks so amazing * These are gorgeous! I picked up 2 during the sale but will be getting the rest of them. These are a very thin, creamy, glowy sheer blushes that make highlighter unnecessary. No detectable glitter just the most beautiful sheen that brings your cheeks back to life! This formula does not dry down however, they do become less sticky but doesn't dry down completely.  Therefore, I would not consider these long wearing but that isn't in the claims either. As someone with dry skin, these are stunning and everything I want, and doesn't emphasize texture. I heard these are a dupe for the makeup by Mario plumping cheek blushes and I can totally see that being the case but I do not own those. * Such a creamy blush with good pigment. It is now one of my staple blushes. Good for those who like to look glowy. Last me all day * I have fair, mature skin. I purchased Garden Party. I applied after foundation and powder. I love the color, although it did pull a little more peachy on me. Applies more sheer but is easily buildable. And the sheen it gives is beautiful. Not shimmery, just glowing. The finish reminds of the Makeup by Mario soft pop plumping blush veil. Love this blush, highly recommend!! * I bought multiple shades of this blush while it was on sale and the colors are so beautiful! The darker shades seem scary but I'm telling you they blend so well and give the look of 'old money'. I have very fair cool toned skin and have tried so many other brands of blush. This is the most user friendly, not too glowy formula I've tried. Powder sits well on top. Worth the try!"

But it doesn't last that long tbh. I wear it to school but at the end of the day some of it is gone. I would still recommend because the shimmer is really cute and I haven't found a blush that is cuter than this for everyday wear. It would be perfect if it lasted longer tho. I see everyone say the blush leaves them patchy, but that is most likely because they have facial hair. I shave my facial hair and it is no longer patchy after I shave it. * I do love the color. However, the longevity of this blush sucks. It doesn't last half a work day. I catch myself reapplying mutiple times a day to keep the color i want. * Really soft and truly works both on cheeks and lips. * Love this product. Goes on smooth. Looks and feels natural. Ive been using for a few years. * 3 years of everyday use I love love love the mauve so much please never discontinue!!!! The formula is incredible it looks so natural and beautiful. I've never found anything better. So much better than any shade of pillow talk for lip * I use it everyday. Super pigmented. Slides on easy! * I'm new to makeup and i wanted to try a budget cream blush. I bought Rosy Wishes but I also liked the super pink one. So far, ive really liked it! Its easy to use; you can use your fingers or a sponge to buff it out, but I prefer using a brush. While it seems to set down and dry, it does wear away easily.

I'm obsessed with this formula! I have aging, combo-oily skin and these stay ALL day. I use a smaller, less dense brush to stipple on my cheeks/temples/nose and it's perfection. I wish more people talked about this product because it deserves it! * This product is very lightweight and sheer which is perfect for summer months where you don't want a full face of makeup. Also the colors are nice (bought peach and cherry).

However, it instantly dries once it hits your face so you need to QUICK so that you aren't left with a streak of unblended color. Its hard to blend out and working to get it to blend moves any makeup that was underneath before application. It also looks patchy on the skin due to difficulty blending. * I've been eyeing this product for a while and decided to try Cherry as an affordable option to the red blush trend. This is STUNNING. Definitely best blended with your fingers right after application before it sets. Dewy and natural and effortless! * I bought this blush as a dupe for the you know what, and i ended up really enjoying this in my routine. The shade is very pretty and it feels so nice and cooling on your skin. Its just a little to blend. * This is a really pretty stain for lips and cheeks! I love the different shades. The price point is decent. I'd say this is a milk dupe but I think undone came out with this first! * OMG I love this blush! It's so buildable and it feels cool on your skin. It's a natural flush that you can keep subtle or really make it pop. * its like the tarte blush sticks but way better. they actually dry down and don't leave a greasy feel at all. ive had so many compliments its unreal. definitely more pigmented than a lot of other blush sticks/stains (looking at you benetint). excellent price for a great product"

I've never tried iconic London before and this makes me want to try more of their stuff, this blushlighter is so good! it goes on so soft and silky smooth, plus it also stays on well! I like that the color can be built up too, for more of a pop. I think all the colors are very neutral and flattering, and I want them all! * I've been looking for something exactly like this for a long time. a blush with a highlight and I've finally found it! it's so soft and silky and applies like a dream! it also has good staying power.

I have used this as a regular blush, which gives a soft glow all over the cheeks and as as highlighter over different blush. if using as a highlighter, it does have a pink under tone, so I had to blend it a little with the blush I did use and it looked so good still! this was my first iconic London item I've ever tried, and I'm now obsessed and am going to have to try more products from them! * Love how it looks on my skin. * Easy to blend and a good shade that works well on medium skintones without feeling heavy or overly saturated * Love the tanny glow on my fair skin.

It dries very quickly and won't blend out once dried. The color is very light and when I tried to add more to build it up, but it just wiped away what was there along with my foundation. While it doesn't work well as a bush I found it works very well as an eyeshadow. I really liked the color so I tried it as an eyeshadow and it looks really nice. It also stays on very well. So if you find it's not the blush for you try it as an eyeshadow. * I'm surprised at the negative reviews. I love the consistency of this product - it's thinner than a cream but thicker than water. I just use my fingers to gently dab on my cheeks. It blends well and looks natural. I do layer it on top of my foundation - maybe if you're dabbing your whole face and then blending it might dry and be difficult to blend out, but I haven't had any issues the way I use it. The color is not thick so it looks very natural. This is my favorite new blush. * I loved the color but sadly I had to return it because it was patchy. No matter if it was on bare skin or with skin tint * Loved it but you just need so much product ao not worth the cost * No 5 star due to application.  Too much always comes out. * Love the flexibility of cream blush. I prefer a subtle tone, so a little of this works perfectly. Melts into my skin and looks natural. NOTE: I bought Provence shade, not Mistral. * Got the blush in the color Provence and it's a beautiful soft nude pink shade. I was eyeing this blush for months but when I couldn't find a similar liquid blush shade to this, I decided to bite the bullet and get it despite reading mixed reviews about this formula. I tried so hard to make this work since the shade is everything I was looking for but it was patchy, splotchy, and hard to blend out. I tried it with a brush, sponge, and my fingers but once it made contact with the skin, it was hard to blend out. The only way I got it to work was if I mixed the blush with another medium like liquid foundation. I held onto it for a few weeks but it wasn't worth the hassle so I returned it unfortunately."

She really loved it and says its easy to use and creamy * If you want to create a look in less than 5 mins this is the easiest kit you'll ever use! You have your blush, bronze and glow all in one kit making it super easy and fast to use. The shades are very creamy and are easy to blend with your fingers. * Everyone needs this kit! It is the perfect size for on-the-go and has a blush, bronze and glow color to use to create an easy and effortless look. * Hydrating pigmented good performance great size i specially love the bronzer * As i have gotten older my skin needs creams instead of powder. I sae these for such a good price and i got them. I love them they blend so nice and creamy. Its a perfect size too so they dont dry out and i can use them fully. * You can easily build up the products depending on what kind of look you're going for, and they blend so smoothly onto skin with fingertips or a sponge! I use this after prepping skin with DIME tinted sunscreen. The highlight blends best with fingertips as it is a little dark, so warm fingers disperse the glow a little better! This is a wonderful set for someone getting into more natural & simple glowwy makeup :)"

Saw reviews where they said it has no lasting power but mine will literally last a full 12 to 14 hours. The only downside I've noticed is that it can be a bit hard to blend. * Easy application. Smooth finish. Love this. The color Bubble on my cool fair skin is perfect.

If you are looking for a shiny blush and is barely noticeable then this is the one. For reference, my skin tone is similar to mocha and when I used this blush, in the shade Belize, I didnt get much pigment. However, I did get the shine. * I had high hopes for this blush but I'm not loving it. it has a strong odor and barely shows up! it's super sheer. if you're going for a very natural look, it works. so I guess I'll use it for daytime? I had to apply it multiple times to even see a bit of color. another huge issue I had is thar there was a finger print already on it when I received it. I had to go in and wipe it with a cloth before using it. why even send me a used product? so disappointed 😞 * I love the subtle sun kissed glow this blush gives me! It blends so well and love that is has shea butter in it. I also have very sensitive skin and this works wonders. * First of all, the finish is beautiful. I was a bit nervous at first because it does seem that there are some really ultra fine bits of glitter in this. I actually don't mind glitter so much, but this just wasn't my goal when I was buying the product. However, when actually applied it just looks very radiant and luminous in a natural way. Like in a celeb way where they seem to glow from within and have no worry in the world lol. And it's not in a greasy way or an oily way that many cream, liquid, and balm blushes are. 

Honestly, I would be keeping this if it just suited my skin tone. This is the second to last darkest shade, and it's the only blush dark enough in the selection that has a rosy tone. The darkest shade seems more like a bronzer imo. This product applies very sheer and the product isn't as burnt red-y purple as in the photo. It's more of a pink. It's not really buildable either. The swatch coverage shown is misleading. I don't necessarily need another pink shade that washes me out in my collection. I have enough of that unfortunately. It seems that these brands never really think about black skin when making these shades, not do they think about the performance on melanated skin. It's honestly very exhausting. If you are any darker than Zoe Kravitz, maybe leave this one on the shelf. Or use it as a bronzer topper. When will POC actually get shades that suit us? I'm so tired of spending money on things that just don't seem to work for me :( * I am a Danessa Myricks super fan. I love so many of her products especially the cream blushers. So naturally, I excitedly bought her lowlighters - terrible on me. So I took a chance in the ELF blushes - the absolute bomb!!! Want them to make a million more colors. Fab prod, terrific price! * The products applies fairly smooth. * I dont know why it took me this long to finally try this blush but OMG. The formula is amazing and I feel like it looks as good as my high end blushes. It has a great staying powder, mind you I have dry skin. It is almost as good as the new liquid blushes. It tends to get a little bit dry after a while but even my expensive cream blushes do, you just need to warm it up a little bit with your finger and your good to go. 
I got the shade Maui because I'm so into mauve blush and this was perfect!!"

Natural looking color.0 * Such a fun makeup to use! the jelly delivers a punch! super pigmented. I love the flushed color for the summer sun burnt blush look. Excited to try some other colors. * I seen a review with somone as the same complexion as me, it looked nice on her. The pigment was actually there! But when i had tride it myself its like the gel was disappearing as i rubbed it in. Im disappointed at the fact it didn't work for me, even with layering. Plus the actual product is TINY! * This product gives a natural flush to the cheeks. It does dry down fast, so you have to work with the product quickly. My complaint is the size of the product. It's pricey for the amount you actually get. The tube is small and it's not even filled all the way with product. * Love it 😍 * I am so glad I found this after a long time gel blush product from another company was discontinued. This is a tint that is buildable and it looks like naturally flushed cheeks, which is exactly what I was looking for! * This is the world's best blush, in my opinion. A little goes a long way, the color is beautiful, it looks natural, and it stays on all day. You can't beat this gel blush for staying power and a natural look."

Like it's so pretty, it's just the aesthetic, form and not function, etc. NOPE. I got the color Crown and it is not nearly as red as it looks in photos, more of a rosy brown. It's the perfect all natural flush (I have light/medium skin with golden undertones). I've used it about a dozen times or more and the rose still maintains it's shape (I use an angled brush). It's also just so pretty that I reach for it over my other blushes now. * Had problems with other bushes and when I found this, I loved it. It's creamy and doesn't need a whole lot to pop. 🩷🩷🩷 * Winky Lux had a luxe line, LAQA, for a number of years and i LOVED their cream highlighters/blush in Preacher's Daughter (coral) and Rose Royce (light rose/pink.) When they ended the line i bought as many as i could. 

So now im out of the Rose Royce and haven't found a dupe. I was really hoping this would be it, but it's rock hard, difficult to apply and cheaply made. Yes, the rose is fun to look at, but it's not an effective product in any way. So disappointed. * I am really unhappy with this blush. It's patchy and doesn't last at all. It looks cute. * I've had 3 of these in different shades and it dissappears within 30 seconds of applying it like literally evaporates. so weird. * i love this blush!!! i got mine in the shade dodgy because i thought it had a funny name but the blush is so beautiful, i love the color and the packaging is beautiful. * This is my favorite blush because it's buildable, it goes on smooth, it never looks patchy or anything!

On my minimal makeup days the glow I get from it is priceless.  I have fair skin and the raspberry was perfect for me.   I have moved towards cream blushes in the past few years and this is my favorite. * Meh. The color is pretty but it doesn't wear well. The strawberry shade is a bit light, even for my fair/light complexion. The color blends well enough but it sort of sits on top of the skin and slides around. It does not stay in place, if that makes sense. I keep re-trying it because I want to love it but it just isn't a great gel/cream blush option for me. * Its easy to build on (I do three swipes on each cheek), easy to blend with a brush, great pigment. My current favorite blush. * Literally NO pigment and made my base cake/oxidize immediately. It was like rubbing a grease stick on my skin. Even on it's own as a dewy look, still does not show up. Also not brown and black friendly in the slightest due to the drop of pigment added. I have a medium olive tone and I used the most vibrant shade, it  did not show up. Don't waste your money, Get Pixi for that price! * Its not pigment the most but its creamy and really blendable. I really like it * Its such a cute blush with good pigment and even some shimmer so it also serves as highlighter. But it doesnt last that long and you'll probably have to reapply * if you've seen the pixi on-the-glow blushes and have been considering buying them, DON'T. buy these instead. not only are they cheaper, but they're better quality. there's also more shade ranges for this product. i have 3 shades: blackberry crush, citrus crush, and raspberry crush. all of them are so beautiful especially in the summer. they are super easy to apply and blend as well as being long lasting through the entire day. i will say that i use this multi-stick more often as a blush, but that's because i have so many different lip products to use. drew barrymore really slayed with this one."

They're just like powder stamped strawberries and the moment you swipe with your brush, they will come off. The color is very pretty but it doesnt last on the skin. I could barely tell at the end of the day that i had any blush on. The formula itself seemed a bit chalky and it took a couple swipes to get the blush to build up. It smells like fresh strawberries, but what good is for the product to smell good if it doesn't perform as it should? Too bad i threw away the box it came in, or i would return it. Not worth the price tag in my opinion. * The scent is too sweet for me, but the color is nice and the texture of it is too. * the scent is very sweet and it leaves a nice pink on your cheeks as well * The smell is absolutely addicting lol.

The powder highlighter is pretty and I do like it, but when you pair it with the two creams, it really isn't anything special. I wish it had been another cream. Another highlighter color or blush color in the cream formula would have been amazing. That's why I have 4 stars and not 5. Still fully worth the price tag for the two products though. * I'm not sure why the reviews are so great for this pallette. first of all, it arrived broken and second I'm pretty fair to medium skin and I have to put several coats of this on and it's hardly noticeable. In my opinion, definitely not worth the price. Highly disappointed. * I love this palette! The blush is agreat color and the cream highlighter is my favorite highlighter of all time. I use the powder highlighter as more of a highlight eyeshadow. I only wish the blush was a cream formula like the middle highlighter. * This texture is stunning. These formulas glide beautifully, no streakiness, perfect tones, and the texture is stunning. Believe the hype. Natasha's makeup is QUALITY. Worth every dime! * The interplay between color and texture in this palette is genius. I cant remember yhr kast time i felt so oretty, as i did when i wore this.

Smash box has had some good stuff, especially foundation and concealer. This product is not one of them. The brush is huge so you'd think you'd get at least volume out of it. For the price I would absolutely recommend not getting this product. I've bought it twice through the years in full size and got one travel size in my ipsy bag and every time it disappointed. * I love the mascara but the brush is too big. I'll stick with Superfan next time which has a smaller brush. * I really love the Greige shade, it's a nice base. This driew so incredibly fast though!! I cant even squeeze it out onto my hand and pick up with a brush because it dries so fast, theres no time to blend it. I have to squeeze it out directly onto my eyelid and immediately blend. Its also very hard to squeeze out of the tube. It's beautiful and lasts all day but its hard to work with. * The shimmer is impossible to clean off your skin, gets everywhere, and lasts for days. I actually got a case of blepharitis on both my eyelids because the shimmer got into my tear ducts. My opthamologist had to stick a metal tool into my tear ducts to drain my eyelids. Do not use this on your eyes if you are prone to blepharitis. * The terracota shade is the only cheek and lip stain that's ever suited me. Hope they never stop selling it. * Great color payoff with a great wear time.  Sits beautifully on the skin. * Smash Box is wonderful to apply & no flakes or smearing, lasts all day!
Only down side is it irritates my sensitive  eyes when I remove at end of day!  If you don't have sensitive eyes give a try, it's worth it!"

I love having mostly matte eyeshadows & the purple & green add neutral pops of color, compliment brown, green & hazel eyes & make lovely liners. I rarely wear bronzer & highlighter but the options provides are nice on my light to medium skin tone & not OTT.

I use it every day! I've created so many wonderful looks with it. I'm going to have to repurchase it as I have used it so much that I've hit pan on a few already. * I just ordered this gorgeous collection.

I usually swipe then pat it gently on my cheekbones. I repurchased a backup recently but I've been using this blush for a few years and it's lasted me that long. Still on the first one and don't want to run out when I do. 

Shade I purchased: 6

My Skintone: Light-Medium (Olive Tone) * Its cute but i thought it would be bigger 😭 * The first time I bought this was in Holland & I fell in love with it. Have not been above to find it for 2 years and I just happen to run across it on Ulta. Bought it now buying one for my sister. * This blush is so beautiful that I can't stop using it. The only thing I dislike is I heard Kiko Milano doesn't keep products around. * Pigment is gorgeous and package is just beautiful and the colors are so beautiful...but why all the shine? Give me some matte or satin finish then I'll repurchase. * I was excited to receive this blush because the color seemed beautiful ""golden coral"" but it doesn't have that much details on the product and when I received it it looked like a super shimmery highlighter. Not what I wanted, it would've been so beautiful without the glitter/shimmer * I am 42 and I can't wear makeup the same as when I was younger. A virtual aid said my color is coral and this shadow is perfect. I can use a little or a lot and it doesn't look clownish. It is very light and silky smooth."

Cannot even see it on the skin. * If you like the idea of liquid blushes but find them overly pigmented and/or difficult to blend, try this!  It's pigmented yet still sheer, and blends beautifully.  I put a little on the back of my hand, smear it around a little, then tap a synthetic brush into it and apply it to my cheeks.  It is buildable, so start with just a little bit and build to your desired intensity.  It applies beautifully and looks completely natural, too!  This is the first Covergirl product I've used in YEARS and I am impressed. * this was hard to blend out and didnt give much color pay off.  wont repurchase * I really loved these blushes. I put them on in the morning and I still have them on when I get home at night after a long day at work. The colors are very nice too, loved more than expected. Would totally recommend! * Bought this a few months ago expecting color...I was sorely mistaken. After I tried it I applied more because even though I extremely fair toned it did not show up at all and disappeared. I'm disappointed to say the least. * I like the versatility of this."

The TLDR of this is that I enjoy the bronzer and two blushes, but hate the highlighter.

The blushes and bronzer are all matte formulas, and then the highlighter is the Super Shock putty-cream like formula. Personally, I never liked the Super Shock formula because I prefer using brushes when doing my makeup, and none of my brushes can pick up this formula, leaving me to do it with my fingers. Okay, whatever. I can get over that. But the biggest problem that I have with this highlighter is that it is mostly GLITTER. I love a glitter highlighter now and then, but not when using an everyday palette for an everyday look. It looks so weird to have matte bronzer and blush, and then a stripe of glitter on my cheekbones. It would be fine if the highlighter was a cute shimmery color, like Lunch Money, but it's very glittery which sucks. Tbh, I bought a cheap Essence highlighter so that I could crush up the ColourPop one and transfer the Essence one into the compact so that I can actually have an all in one palette. Oh well.

However, the packaging is a bit of a miss too. Aesthetically, it looks great, but mine no longer clasps shut even though I haven't done anything like drop it. So it's probably not a great option for traveling anymore, which was why I wanted it… lol * I love this blush. It has the perfect combination of bronzer, blush shades, and highlighter. I like to mix all of the shades onto my cheeks. I continue to purchase it because I love how it looks on my cheeks and the compliments I recieve. I just have one reoccurring issue with this product and it has nothing to do with the shades and everything to do with the packaging. Everytime I have purchased this product the container falls apart so easily. It fails to protect the powder causing it to eventually crumble apart. I continue to purchase it because I absolutley love it but I wish colourpop would read all their reviews regarding the poor container packaging and create something more durable so that the powder will not shatter. * One of my go to palletes, especially for the blush!! I like to mix the bottom two. The pigment is just right and very buildable. Could be used for natural or full glam :)"

I shockingly love it. I'm OILY and it stayed on the entire night. I fell asleep with it on and it DID NOT BUDGE. STAYED COMPLETELY THE SAME. If you're an oily  girl you NEED this palette. This formula is top notch. Cannot wait for them to make more colors. And yes, if you're dry or normal to dry, it is going to be harsh on your skin and if you don't moisturize your face well you cannot blend it. However, I absolutely had NO trouble blending. It is not a secret technique that I'm using on my face. HYDRATE and use an oil with your face cream if you need to. * Beautiful shades of peach and highlighter. Goes on smooth and never blotchy. Hope they add different colors in the future…this is a keeper for sure!! * The shades included are pretty but the pigment and blendability is lackluster. It might be worth it to buy it on sale. I am going to return this item and use my Mac blushes instead. * The powders aren't bad, but the Highlighter breaks so easily that I haven't received one not broken yet, so I can't recommend this since it's just constantly broken."

The peak-a-boo silver cover is really nice. I also love that I can get a soft flushed look with this blush. I can also add a bit more and it gives that pow.

This is definitely a new fav. * I love the blush and it's consistency. I was a little scare about the liquid formula seperating my makeup but that didn't happen. It's nice for me since I love less pigmented products * I think the poor reviews on this product were expecting a dupe (even though its not marketed as one). It says ultralight snd thats whst it is, irs perfect for summer (not full glam, not on foundation). Toasty is the perfect blush/bronzer combo. * I really like this blush! you barely need to put product on your face to have a lot of pigment, so I know this thing is gonna last forever. you do need to blend kinda quickly, and I recommend using a liquid blush brush. I only wear tinted moisturizer, not foundation, so idk how it would work with that, but it does just fine with moisturizer. This is an affordable, lovely blush! * I got the shade cheeky and it has a bit more warmth than i expected for a 'blue pink', but it's a super pretty color anyways! it has the perfect medium amount of pigment and was super easy to blend out with a pretty finish. Wore well too * I bought Cheeky and its such a pretty and flattering color for me. I put the product first on the back of my hand then swipe a brush over the color and apply it then to my cheeks. I need to get more colors! * I bought the shade toasty, it's a lovely toasted caramel color. I like that the packaging is bigger than other drugstore blushes in this kind of packaging, and I really like that it has a locking mechanism and snap faceted cap. It's very easy to use.

 However, it didn't suit my skin. I have dry skin and this dries down too fast for me to blend it out, even over a hydrating primer and with the assistance of a facial mist. It leaves a stain, which is a plus, if you are able to blend it out."

I love the pink shade and all of the iridescent sparkle. * I purchased this for my 13 year old niece. She is medium toned skin with long straight dark hair. This looked lovely on her. She really liked it! * I found the pigments patchy and hard to blend. Also not really sure what skin tone this palette is for... I'm very fair and the lightest color is still way too light. I actually can use it as a highlighter. The medium two do work for me as blush but honestly on the skin they look the same. And then I though the darkest one would be pretty if I could sheer it out, but since it's so patchy I end up having to use a lot and then it's just way to dark. I think it would be better if they made different palettes for different skin tones. O, and if you're buying this for the glitter, don't. It's only on top. * This palette is stunning! Beautiful, BEAUTIFUL, shimmering colors, and very affordable! * I love glue and sparkling things. I'm crazy about this set because it has the colors I like with the touch of glitter that I love. I bought it as a gift but had to keep it for myself 🥰 * I have a fair skintone, but do tan in the summer. This highlight was exactly what I've been looking for. Beautiful color, and the sparkles are bright and glowing! I used the pink color as eyeshadow and it wasn't too pigmented, but gave a nice glow. * I noticed all the photo reviews of this product are trash and not very helpful. Even the photos of the palette from the site and website aren't too helpful for what this is. I am using the app and realize there's no option to upload a photo as well, so let me explain what you get exactly to aid your decision in purchasing this palette. 

I am happy with the four tones. They are quite different from one another. The first blush on the very left is a pink. It is metallic bright baby pink with blue glitter overspray. Yes, the actual blush is metallic. Like a highlighter. It is not just the overspray. 

The second shade from the left is a warm rose shade. It is less metallic than the pink first one and definitely has a more natural appearance. It has a gold glitter overspray. 

The 3rd shade is a peachy tone with a champagne glitter overspray. It is metallic like the rest of them. 

The last shade is the one that surprised me the most. It is a deep red shade, a burgundy in the pan. It would suit deeper skin tones for sure.  Again, it is metallic and has a gold glitter overspray. 

There's actually not that much glitter overspray as I imagined from reading other reviews. HOWEVER, The shades are metallic (some more than others), so they will give a sheen off your cheeks. The first and last shade are the most highlighter-like shades. 

I am fair-light in skin tone and I am happy with this purchase. I didn't know what I was getting. It is a good value. It would work with even much deeper skin tones due to the sheen and reflection of color that it offers. 

It is not bad. Just know what you're getting. That is shiny blushes with a little bit of glitter. Great value. 

If you want a matte finish, this is NOT for you. And these blushes can actually look natural, except for the first and last shade (too reflective). The 2nd and 3rd blushes give a healthy glow."

Quality products. You will not be disappointed. * A photo doesn't always portray a color accurately or how it will actually look like on your face. Looking at the photo the pallet appears soft pink. It is actually more brown on the skin and like a bronzer. Perhaps trying to make it lighter will help. * This leaves the most unflattering tone on my skin. Not universal and leaves a grey-ash cast. I don't like this AT ALL. Also leaves texture. * Love this LM highlighter I use for an everyday simple look I use my cc cream and LM Chai blush and some mascara to complement my look 🥰 * I was certain I'd love this and ordered it sight unseen. Well, ...

Pros: It has a lovely sheen, noticeable but not metallic or Ofra-y, with zero glitter.

Cons: It's not at all the pale pink you see in the picture, and I'm really not sure what the brand means by ""self-adjusting to match all skin tones."" The color is truer to the product's name; it's a definite, discernible rose. My skin is light to light-medium, not fair by any means, and there's no way this could be a highlighter on me. (Thing is, I don't think it's rich enough to work on deep skin. And it seems too cool to be right for tan skin.) Anyway, on me it's a blush/blush topper for sure.

I can't complain about the formula, and I'm sure I'll use it - but if I'd been able to swatch it first I probably wouldn't have bought it. * I had high hopes for this highlighter but was disappointed when, what I expected to be a pale neutral pink shade was actually a midtoned champagne that's too dark and warm for my very fair, cool toned skin.  

Since this isn't available at any store near me, I bought it based on the photo showing a pale pink swatch, the description of a neutral undertone and the self adjusting shade claim, none of which is accurate.  I could tell just by swatching that it wouldn't work but I applied it anyway and saw that it definitely was too dark and warm.  Since I only wore it for a few minutes, I can't speak to the formula or wear time other than to say it's pigmented with a glitter free buildable shine.  

With the level of technology available, there's no excuse for product photos to be so inaccurate, a problem that also adds to the already excessive amount of wasted makeup.  I love many Laura Mercier products but this was a fail and while I think the shade could work on light to tan skintones, it's too dark for fair and possibly too ashy on deep."

I love the concept I get the idea, works really well and looks pretty, but the packaging breaks apart and quite literally is paper. If this was refillable with still a recycled plastic case that you could recycle again, would love it but the paper case is why I might not repurchase. (Didnt even talc was #1 ingrident :/ ) * I loved the look of this blush, the packaging, contrasting colors, the purple color. It didn't disappoint! It's highly pigmented and lasts the whole day. While the color is deep eggplant in the pan it does run a bit more fushia, not a deal breaker though, still purple. The swatches are accurate! * I never thought a brown blush would be for me. I am usually a peach girly but i have been using magic brownie for almost a year. I appreciate that the packaging is sustainable. Mine has been beat up a but after some time but it has not fallen apart or torn in anyway. * I bought Sexual Flufstration and the color and texture are gorgeous, but the packaging broke immediately. This carton situation really is not practical. You should introduce an actual compact and then sell the refills in the egg carton material. Until then, save your money and buy the lip color and use it on your cheeks too. * Bought this brown blush to try out the ""rich girl makeup"" and its a great putty cream to powder blush but I didnt realize this brand was intended to be used as a custom palette. The foam/paper compact is fragile and it broke so I cant securely close it anymore. * This packaging feels like paper meets styrophome. It breaks and falls apart whenever you try to open an use the product. I contemplated taking it out of the packaging entirely but due to its cream nsture crumbs and hair and everything else sticks to it. If you want ti buy this, try it out in person first. Very didappointing. * Purchased this beautiful Color:Only Drama-magenta plum.  Was search of a winter purple... upset over the talc ... more upset that the shade didn't last on skin.  Used with BB Face base, both elf primers, all nighter and just faded.  I'm medium beige to tan and my lil girl whom picked the color is very fair cool and it didn't last as well. Used layered as blush/eyeshadow. May return... It may work for someone else."

Most lipsticks don't last long on me, so I have fo constantly reapply. With this one, it stays in place for a long time. I usually apply a little bit of tinted lip oil on top, and it's perfect. I will be waiting for more shades! * I appreciated this cheek and lip stain for how pigmented and long lasting it was on both my cheeks and lips. I put it on in the morning and was out in the sun all day and it was still very present on my skin and lips when I got home several hours later. 

The stain is very easy to use on lips, but more difficult to use on cheeks. Having largely used cream blushes, it took several uses to get adapted to the lack of blend-ability for this product. I also need to find another applicator to try to use, as I usually use my fingers to blend out products and as an applicator, but this product stained them. 

I do really appreciate the high quality of both the packaging and the product itself, as well as the mission of the brand Ere Perez and this product as a whole. * I used the Beetroot Cheek and Lip tint primarily as a lip tint. WOW did it last!! Initially when applied to the lips it gives a very vibrant coral pink and red hue that is a little too overwhelming for my taste but when I wiped the lip tint off with a towel and pursed my lips together moving the lip tint around it was a beautiful shade that was perfect for summer.
A Tip- the tint is extremely long lasting (By long lasting I mean almost all day with eating and drinking), with that being said it is also somewhat staining. Precisely apply because I found out if I got it out of where it should be applied, it did not easily wipe off and the stain was still there along with my lipstick for a lot of the day. Also be careful on what the lip tint gets on (fingers, clothes, porous countertops, etc) as it is difficult to get off.
This review was collected as part of a promotion. * The Ere Perez beetroot cheek and lip tinted came in the color Joy. Joy is a bright cherry red color that has a bit of an orange tint to the color. The applicator is strong and not flimsy. When applying it on my lips it went on smooth and covered a good portion of my lips with one swipe. As the product is a tint multiple layers were needed to cover the area and have a build up to be an even layer. The product is light weight and because of that it feels as if you aren't wearing anything on your lips. The color is bright and very pigmented and because of that I choose to not try it on my cheeks. I tried it out after eating and learned that it does not fade evenly. My lips did feel hydrated and unlike other tints didn't have a dry feeling. The finish is a bit glossy rather than a matte color. * As someone new to the world of tints, I was so excited to try this. I was curious to see how it would compare to traditional blushes and lipsticks. 

Starting with thr basics, the packaging: it is sleek and minimalist, which I appreciate. The compact size makes it easy to carry in my purse, perfect for on-the-go touch-ups.
Applying the tint was straightforward, even for a beginner like me. The product glides smoothly onto both cheeks and lips. I found that using my fingers to blend the tint gave me the best results, providing a natural, flushed look. The color is buildable, so you can go for a subtle hint of color or a more dramatic pop, depending on your preference. It left mr with a vibrant, rosy hue that looks very natural on my skin. I got shade ""joy"" which i was worried would be too bright and clownish on me. But it turned out to be a versatile shade that I think would complement a variety of skin tones. The texture is lightweight and not sticky, which I loved. It feels comfortable on the skin and doesn't dry out my lips, a common issue I've had with other lip products.
I was also quite impressed with the staying power. It lasted several hours on both my cheeks and lips without the need for reapplication. Even after a meal, the color on my lips faded gracefully, leaving a nice stain rather than completely disappearing.

Overall, I am thrilled with this product! As my first foray into tints, it has set the bar high. The ease of use, natural finish, and impressive longevity make it a fantastic addition to my makeup routine. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile, high-quality tint that enhances natural beauty. * I used this Ere Perez Beetroot Cheek and Lip Tint in the red color and thought it was a very nice color payoff! I've not previously used a product like this so it was my first experience. The product was very liquidy and had very strong, red coloring. I would definitely recommend to start small with application and add more as needed especially on the cheeks as this was just a lot of color at once. I applied dots on my face and lips then blended them out with my finger. My finger was very stained red but I was able to blend it out well on my cheeks and lips best with my finger. I don't really like wearing red on my lips or face but this gave me a nice flushed appearance and looked very natural. I love that this product uses a lot of natural ingredients and it is really buildable if you want more rich coloring on your lips or face! I think you have to remember that it is not a lipstick or lip gloss and adjust your expectations and usage with this in mind! It does what it's supposed to do! Was certainly a nice product and my first of its kind I've tried! Definitely worth a try! * I am a retired crunchy beauty babe. I will always happily use natural based beauty products, however, I'm very tired these days, and got to a point where it wasn't great for my mental health to focus on all the good, bad, and ugly ingredients out there. That being said, Ere Perez really appeals to that natural loving part of my personality, and I was so excited to try the beetroot tint.
I definitely found some pros and cons with the product, and was left with mixed feelings. She's very pigmented, which is great! I on the other hand, am lacking in the pigment department. I really wanted to like this as a cheek tint or blush, but it appears this is either very much the wrong color for me, I lack the skills necessary to apply it properly, or a combination of both. I tried a few times with various tools, and I don't think we're meant to be a blush relationship.  I am curious about using the stain on my cheeks as part of a tantour situation, but I still think the red is probably just too red for me in this scenario. 
Just because we can't have a cheeky relationship doesn't mean we can't work things out! I really like the beetroot tint as a lip stain! I have been in a brown lip era, so it was a bit of a shock to my senses when I first popped it on as lip color, but it made me remember that sometimes a true red lip is what you need. (Plus, a red lip is a great way to say ""eff you"" to fascism if you're familiar with the history of a red lip.) The stain on its own is a really lovely true red. It is sticky for a moment, but that texture wipes off to a long lasting stain. After a few wears, I realized that it will calm down to a more casual dark pink on its own. I would avoid eating a greasy snack while wearing it unless you're ready to reapply after. 
It has a very mild non offensive flavor when applied - slightly sweet and not very beet-like. Also, it was partner approved. Inappropriate comments were made by him, so I believe he rates it 5 stars. I really hope Ere Perez expands the beetroot line into more colors, so maybe I can find the right cheek shade down the road.

I tried to build it up, but couldn't get color payoff.  I've been much happier with liquid blush from the drugstore.  You might have better results with a darker shade than Rose Riot. * I purchased the shade cheeky coral. I have light to medium skin and it does not show up on my skin at all. It breaks apart on my skin then disappears. Ive tried using a sponge, brush, putting it directly on my cheeks, putting it on the back of my hand and no luck :( the color is beautiful though! Does anyone have any tips and tricks on how to get this product to show up and stay on the skin? * Had rhis on my favorites page for a year and extremely disappointed. First use, way too much product came out that i had to waste. Does not blend well, have to use an additonal blush to blend into face. * Perfect finish, can use it alone or layer with a powder blush. It doesn't move my base products around and it doesn't exaggerate my poor skin texture. Ive used multiple brushes to see if it would change the look or finish, but it always blends seamlessly. Highly recommend * I'm not much for make up, so switching to a liquid blush was intimidating but it's pretty easy to use!  You can layer up on how much you want the color to pop, and it stays on an oily face like mine ALL DAY.  I get compliments every time I wear this stuff! 
It's not a crème consistency, so careful with how you squeeze the tube! * Doesn't show any color on my light skin, and so much products leaks out when taking the cap off. Very disappointing!"

The bright pink is not as bright and the other two are more mauve and are very similiar to one another. 

Balmy texture that feels completely weightless on tbe skin and easy to blend but I am disappointed with the colors. I'm still on the fence if I should keep. * Balmy formula that sinks into your skin and blends so easily! I use it as blush and as a balm and loved it. Great for summer heat. * You have to layer on the pigment a million times. I normally like Milani products but this blush is a no go, still prefer prestige brands Blush sticks. * I love, blends so beautifully. So creamy! Can add more for more color tone! Never patchy. My favorite ever, all I do is recommend * Wonderfully creamy, beautiful colors * First, this handy little palette definitely gets the job done and on a pretty good range of skin tones; however, more shades are needed! These powders have a luxury feel to them. Almost buttery, a little can go a very long way! That being said, if you have VERY light skin tones, you're going to want to go in with a light hand and build! On the other hand if you have dark skin tones, you're going to be able to load up your brush and apply. They do build nicely; still though too much of a good thing is too much. So while I absolutely love this concept like the many ""multiple steps palettes""  out there, it's not a one size fits all. Unfortunately finding that one size fits all is extremely hard to find in this department; that's the beauty of people being different! 
In the end, it's a fantastic little palette that I'd highly recommend; especially in an MUA bag or any makeup lovers collection that could benefit from these shades. Great price for great formulas. Now let's see more and more."

If you're looking for something subtle, this would be great for you. * I like the color ok but wish there was more actual product. Included is a tiny brush and mirror that will never get used. Too much packaging. * i'm a blush fanatic. i love trying new ones. i also love physicians formula. i had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately there's little to no color payoff. i was highly disappointed. i want to like it, but i'm afraid i just don't. * Pretty buttery and gives a subtle glow. However this shade would only show up on fair to light skin. * I would have to use the entire compact to get any color, barely shows up and my skin tone is on the medium olive side. Dave your money. I gave it 3 stars because maybe it will work better for those with super fair skin. * perfect🤩"

I have bought this several times to gift and will continue to do so. * The product is great for the price, i use it mostly on my cheeks and it gives me a nice flush, i do think it feels a bit thin on lips but I usually put balm on after, overall for the price its worth it. It also rated good on yuka. * Feels like olive oil on your lips drys out i like the color but not for me * It puts tint on my lips and stays once it's dry. It works better than my $30 lipgloss * I have very pale lips so when I tried out this and realized that it stained very well and very pink it was game over for all other lip stains! It also lasts a very long time and I really recommend putting a clearish pinky lip gloss on top and it looks flawless.! * The gloss changes to a super pretty natural pink color, however, it was very drying to my lips. * As a fair, warm olive complexion, I struggle with finding pink blushes/lip colors that don't look like I'm channeling my mom's look from the 1980s. Even though this turns incredibly pink on me, it's a pretty natural-looking flush.

This product works great as a blush, especially if you're into sunburn or igari style blush application. I recommend applying with fingertips (wash after unless you like pink fingers) or a sponge (which will be hot pink forever after, no matter how much you wash it). Despite the instant, permanent stain on my beauty blender, the blush is pretty forgiving and buildable over a sunscreen or primer — definitely need to be more careful over a tinted moisturizer or foundation, though. 

I don't love using this alone on my lips, as it is definitely a bit drying and has an almost soapy taste to it, but it settles in quickly and acts more like a lip stain than a gloss or oil. I like to add a lip balm or gloss over the top for  a moisturized, just-bitten look."
