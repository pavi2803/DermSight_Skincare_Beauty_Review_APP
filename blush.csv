0,nyx professional makeup,buttermelt pressed powder blush,pimprod2045333,2624632," * Im going to start of by saying that this blush is so cheep but amazing! Its super pigmented but blends out really nicely and they have a lot of good shades. * This blush is so stunning! The color lasts a very long time and you do not need a lot to get the color you want out of it. With that being said, I have to be ever so delicate with the amount I put on since it is SO pigmented. A little goes a very long way, but its slightly a nuisance. However, I did get a deeper shade since I really like the color, so it could just not be formulated for my skin tone in mind, and that makes complete sense. * This blush is way too pigmented which is normally a good thing but not with this blush. I barely even touch the product and it's extremely pigmented, its hard to fix. It also goes on patchy. * I was skeptical before buying it but I can definitely vouch for it now. It really has a buttery effect and leaves your skin looking radiant. * I like this blush, I want to love it but it's almost too pigmented. * I wasnt sure what to expect with the recommensation of this shade of blush but so glad I purchased. I am a fair-medium olive tone with green eyes and this blush adds thee perfect kiss of flush. It is SUPER pigmented so I barely dust my brush and it has lasted all day. Havent experiended super hot weather yet so I cannot comment on the staying power in heat. * I purchased this blush in March and will check to see if it clogs my pores by summer."
1,perricone md,no makeup blush,pimprod2004408,2541775," * This is by far my favorite EVER blush!! I have goofy combo skin and some fine lines-this blush goes on so nicely and it doesn't make my face look more oily in my t zone and it does not settle into drier skin and lines! Absolutely worth the price and I hope they never stop making this blush! * I love this and the color but it used to have spf in it. Now it's just a regular blush. I noticed the brand has been doing away with the products being spf. Which is a shame since that's the reason I stocked up in early spring. Now since it has no spf, I am in no hurry to purchase. I still miss there spf gloss that used to be this color. * I've been using this blush for over a year now and I love this stuff!  I have dry, flaky skin and using powder blush accentuates my dry spots. This blush gives me a beautiful glow with some added moisture.  Long lasting and beautiful! I really think this blush would be good for all skin types especially dryer skin, a little goes a long way! * I love this blush in the summer when I need a bit of a boost on my cheeks for going out after doing some sun loving activities. I have sensitive skin, so when working outdoors I can only have sunscreen. Due to the sunscreen in the blush this helps being able to put some neutral makeup on for work without the risk of my face getting sunburned with regular makeup. I love the neutral color. Perricone MD used to sell an spf lipgloss in this color as well, I wish they brought back the lipgloss as it smelled great and worked fantastically. * CONS 
1. This blush burnt my skin. 
I applied the blush almost daily for several months. 2 weeks ago the skin on my cheek bones where the blush touched (in the exact shape I apply my blush) got a terrible allergic reaction: painful, red, extremely dry and bumpy. It has been several days of using soothing skincare, and the irritation is still there, although very slowly subsiding. 
2. As other reviewershave mentioned, the cap cracks easily when you screw the top closed. 

PROS 
The shade is buildable and starts very subtle. I have light skin, cool undertone, and this blush looked beautiful. * i only used this once or twice. i screwed the cap on too tight one time and the lid breaks and the stopper sank to the bottom. please replace the cheap plastic with metal. * I love the color of this blush and it blends beautifully. Big drawback though is the packaging. The lid completely cracked when I tightened it. I love this blush but now I can't take it anywhere. Please fix this packaging!!!!!"
2,e.l.f. cosmetics,camo liquid blush,pimprod2042954,2617738," * It last a really long time and it is really vibrant, but it leaks so bad! It stains my makeup bag all the time! ☹️ * It last a really long time and it is really vibrant, but it leaks so bad! It stains my makeup bag all the time! ☹️ * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review. This was an awesome liquid blush! The color was very strong, but blended in very well. I couldn't believe the price for the quality of the product! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to start using a liquid blush. * it is not the most blendable i it just dries soo fast so work fast if you buy it but it also broke me out 
but i do have really sensitive skin so it might not break you out so idk its a pretty color tho * I will forever continue buying this blush. The price is amazing considering the product goes a long way with just a little of it! * I am tan and this color didn't quite work for me but it looks beautiful for paler skin. * I received this product in exchange for my honest review.
The Bold-Faced Lilac shade looked a little too light for my skin tone, so I didn't use it in photos, but I've tried other shades in this line and they're amazing! The formula is super creamy, blends out beautifully, and gives a natural, glowy flush. It's lightweight and buildable, so you can go subtle or bold depending on the look. I really appreciate how easy it is to work with and that it doesn't dry too fast. Definitely one of my fave affordable blush formulas!"
3,dior,rosy glow blush,pimprod2039824,2612203, * I now get the hype of this blush on. The shade pink really adopt the skin tone you have… This is the pink blush on I am looking for…I think it is similar to milani's luminoso shade…without the shimmer…I just think so * I fell in love with the Lilac Pink color. It looks beautiful with my complexion. The packaging is luxe so it gives me a little joy to see it among the more budget friendly makeup I normally use. The blush has a faint fruity scent which is so delightful when applying but fades quickly so is not bothersome. So initially I 100% fell in love with this blush. But after only a few weeks of use it developed hardpan and I couldn't get any product on my brush. Scraping the blush or using tape to remove the upper layer is helping get to the good product but it quickly hardpans again. I should be able to get through the blush but won't repurchase. For that kind of money I expected much better performance. I don't have this problem with the drugstore blushes I use. * I have the lavender shade & you literally have to dig in the product for any pigment. I use this on days where im trying to look like im wearing no makeup. Definitely not worth the price. * I have the lavender shade & you literally have to dig in the product for any pigment. I use this on days where im trying to look like im wearing no makeup. Definitely not worth the price. * Surprised by the high rating on this particular product. The pink has ZERO pigment. Ill try to use a spray on the compact itself to lift the product but it is absolutely not worth the money. * Very pretty blush. I'm hoping it will look great during the summer when I have more color as I chose the cherry shade which is absolutely gorgeous. * I love this blush! I use it over my YSL liquid blush abd the combo is unreal. Please bring back the lavender shade! It's sooo pretty!
4,benefit cosmetics,liquid lip blush & cheek tint,pimprod2008308,2547730," * It's a versatile product that gives natural blend-able color. Fantastic every time! * Very expensive, but worth the money. I will use this in the summer because if it's tint. I love how it is a tint  because it will tint and give me a natural look without coming off in water. * the color stains well and is nice but it agressively chaps your lips. after using my lips, especially in the corners, turn red, chapped, and bumpy. my friends have this issue as well, so I dont think I am allergic. be mindful when using. * It's ok on the cheeks. It's messy to put on and can stain your fingers. On the lips it's awful. I've tried everything with this- one coat- layering and it only sticks to certain areas. Doesn't last. It also has a strong rose flavor on the lips which is off-putting. I wanted a lip stain and this isn't it. It's ok for the cheeks. * The smell is yuck. I don't know where they get that is lasting 8 hours from. This is gone in an hour with maybe some staining around the rim of your lips. Do not recommend. It'd be pretty if it actually stayed and wasn't toxic smell * I absolutely love mixing this with the high beam for my cheeks, especially during the summer. I liked the color on my lips, but it dries them out so terribly that I won't do that again. * I had this product 15 years ago when it first came out. The size of the bottle and color were both much better back then. It now feels watery, and the color muted. Save your money. It's not worth the cost anymore. It used to be!"
5,nars,blush,pimprod2044741,2621261," * I've been using the original NARS orgasm color for years, and it's always been my favorite. Finally ran out of my stockpile and had to buy one of these new formula ones. It's nice they're talc-free but the color is much lighter, less pigmented, and the actual formula has changed and feels more powdery to me. Not a fan, very sad, hope they can improve on this new formula ASAP. * I love the color.  Has the perfect sheen to as well.  It's the perfect shade of peachy pink.  It goes on smooth.  Last's a long time.  Will buy it again. * Im so dissatisfied with the new formulation. Not even close to the color payoff the OG blush had. * Nars use to carry my all time favorite blushes, Orgasm and Sin. Now they carry my least favorite blushes. Sin has been discontinued and havent found a replacement yet. The reformulation has no pigment. Its really bad. Orgasm may as well of been discontinued. Its not like the original. Doesnt show up. And im very fair. I can't believe someone approved this. Especially with such a cult classic shade. Idk whats up with Nars lately. Possible dupes are YSL-Make Me Blush, shade 93 for Orgasm and LH Cosmetics- Duo Dimension, shade Area for Sin. But hey, at least the new packaging is nice. You can pop the pans out. I just wouldnt want to anymore. * I was trying to buy the original shade of Nars Orgasm blush and ended up with one that is much lighter.  I wish they would have tagged the OG. * I've been using this blush for years and it truly is the best! * I have been using the Orgasm shade for several years. I tried the shade #237 and I was pleasantly surprised that it was a bit darker than my fave but it looked really nice and seems to last all day."
6,pixi,on-the-glow blush tinted moisture stick,pimprod2032976,2598116," * I got the shade ruby and its amazing! But after 30 minutes its gone. People think i have blish blindness but i have to pack it on un order for it to stay. So convenient and i like the application, unfortunately all together, id rather have a blush that lasts. * love the light pink tint, literally is such a glowy blush. * I rated 3 stars due to how difficult this product is when I am wearing liquid foundation: it does not blend easily and it removes the product underneath it. I recommend this if you're not a liquid foundation wearer, or looking for the ""no-makeup"" makeup look. * this product is very beautiful, pretty pigmented, a gorgeous color, coverage, and blend ability. i got the reddish pink shade for summer and it is so beautiful, i would definitely buy again and i highly recommend it to anyone as i think it could work on most skin tones, it is also pretty cheap which is a bonus. * I have warm skin tone and i was worried this would be too vibrant or not blend as well. Honestly little goes such a long way! It looks so. Natural, ive been getting compliments on my sunkissed makeup look. I do plan to purchase again in the future. 

The shades i bought were Ruby and Fleur * I got this product a week ago and i have used this EVERY DAY. A bit overpriced for how much your getting, but i would buy again. 11/10 from me. * Ruby is such a pretty color with a bright pop but it's very blendable. It's not too bright at all. Looks pretty against pale winter skin, as well as tan skin (which I am so resdy for!). I use a stiff brush and kind of stipple on then blend as needed."
7,pur,silky tint creamy multitasking stick,pimprod2044097,2620463," * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This was a nice blush. Overall it wasn't my favorite formula- it would occasionally lift my foundation underneath but with patience and a brush application it was nice. * Product goes on smooth but my skin is too tan to see it and I'm not that dark. It completely disappeared on my cheeks. Its not easy to put on your lips if you have a defined cupids bow. * I like this cream stick blush lip color,  it's creamy and a nice natural color and it has staying power.  I like that it does last and last all day long, and it looks very natural.  I also love this as lip color. * This cream blush stick/ lipstick is a great versatile product. It's is a beautiful pink color and it really works well on cheeks or lips. The only issue is that it can be a little greasy and heavy on the cheeks, but it's a great product to carry that works in different applications. * The whole line is sadly so drying * I never recived my product I reached out at least 4 times after the 15 days after shipped never got a reply this is the 2nd product i haven't gotten i have asked my task time is running out what do I do and I dont want to get in trouble for not writing anything  this looks like it would have been a nice product and looked really pretty as a highlighter unfortunately I wasn't able to try it. * I rated this highlighter a 3 out of 5. I will definitely continue to use because I've been wanting to switch to more of a liquid highlighter versus powder. A little goes a long way with this product and I like the glowy shimmer of the finished look. Only thing is I feel like I didn't really notice the glow/shimmer much when I tried to capture a picture of the finished look (hence no picture of the finished look). I like that this could also be a lipstick but again, a little goes a long way on the lips. Can definitely be paired with lip liner and lip gloss. I would purchase this product again."
8,juvia's place,blushed duo,pimprod2025280,2583745," * This is a fantastic product. The tones are so warm and light up the right areas, giving your face the structure you want. Will be buying it again! * Love the pigment and want to get other colors. There is a little bit of fallout. * Very pigmentation. Lasted the whole day. * I hope they make this until im 90. Affordable, beautiful, what more could i ask for? * This is my first purchase from Juvia's Place and I am impressed! The colors are beautiful and have real staying power. A little goes a long way. I would definitely purchase again! * I absolutely love these blushes and definitely reccomend. They are very pigmented, so build it up little by little. I like how it comes with 2 different blushes. I have this in 3 shades: vol 2, 4, and 5. For volume 4, I like to lightly dust the lighter pink shade on my under eyes when I don't have my pink setting powder. * this is so good a recomemded 100%"
9,morphe,huephoric rush 3-in-1 silk blush,pimprod2045434,2625272," * I absolutely Love this blush and purchased the initial 4 colors they started with as soon as I saw them as the swirl looked so interesting. I've not been disappointed and will be buying the 2 newest shades. These are creamy and go on smoothly. They are highly pigmented and you can build your color as desired. They blend well and with my fair skin I used the darker shades to create those shadows where I want them. As I am more mature, 65 y/o,  than many writing reviews, I do tend to have some larger pores bur have not found this to be clogging in any way and while it stays on beautifully throughout the day I don't find it difficult to remove at night with my double wash. Run, don't walk, to add this to your makeup bag! * As lovely as the shades are, the very first item on the ingredient list, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, is highly comedogenic (pore clogging). It can also cause breakouts. I can't get myself to apply this on my cheeks and nose which is exactly where my pores are. * Made my foundation separate. Ive tried warming it up on my hand. Covering my brush with it on a pallete. Tried fluffy brush and dense brush. It all caused separation. I think my skin just prefers liquid blushes. Easier to blend out. * I got the shade pleasured which is the warm pink. Its a bit sheer but its a really cute color. You can build up the pigment and it looks very dewy on the skin. * The first item on the ingredient list is Ethylhexyl Palmitate which is highly comedogenic. Its probably what also makes this blush so emollient and easy to blend. The shades are lovely too. Just unfortunate. * This blush does not move! Super pigmented and lasts foreverrrrr. Seriously like bury me in this blush i will be forever rosy. I work 10 hour days and it soesnt move. I love it. My new holy grail < 3 * Love this blush, it stays on so strong and is so light feeling on the skin!"

It's such a unique formula. The powder is not patchy or too dry, so once it sits on the skin, it blends beautifully and looks like real skin. My skin tone is fair neutral (think Elf Soft Glow shade 13) and the Velvet Crush color is my perfect match. I hope they make this product forever because I just love it! * Long wearing * I don't know if it was mis-labeled or what, but it's way darker than I wanted. I wanted something light and shimmery. And, the smell kind of grosses me out. * The color looks so pretty. Blurring effect is real. * The color looks so pretty. Blurring effect is real."

Surprisingly good quality. * Pretty and strong color.  Worth it for the price. * this product is good. it's long lasting, although it stains your face and if you leave a dot of blush to blend it out later it stains in that shape too. the best thing about this product is you wont run out so quickly because of how little you need. Great for all skintones * Most pigmented, affordable blushes. Blends so easily and colors are beautiful. * Large color payoff for only a little product! I love this liquid blush. It lasts all day and the colors are beautiful!"

14,tarte,shape tape glow blush bar,pimprod2044745,2622622," * I love this palette. Im not big on blush because my cheeks are red. Im always trying to cover the redness. I love all three shades of the lighter one. The highlighter is amazing looks good everywhere. I wear it as eyeshadow also. Im shocked but i love the blush. Thanks again tarte!!! * This palette is amazing!! The bronzer is the perfect shade, im light-medium skin tone and i find it perfect. The blushes are gorgeous!! Pigmented and beautiful! I kind of compared the blushes to the new rare one, but i like this better. I really recommend this palette, if you can find it, run for it! * I was so excited to see Tartes new glow bar the colors are perfect for summer * The blushes and highlighter in this palette are pigmented and gorgeous!!! * I bought this and have been lovong the sparkling blushes and the highlighter. These are super pigmented and pretty for spring and summer * I was hesitant to order this palette seeing there wasn't any reviews & also knowing the lack of tone range within Tarte's line however....this is beautiful!! I ordered the 'Berry Bar' ((darker one)) and it does compliment my skin tone perfectly, which is medium to tan in most makeup lines. I can get A LOT of color payoff using a light hand,  every color has a dewy glow, and lasted thru my 10 hour work day. The only critique I can imagine would be the bronzer not working for anyone darker than a tan skin tone. If you have a deep color, the bronzer may just give you a pretty glow without a pigment. Overall, I really like this palette thus far & can most def see me reaching for this more than not!"

17,stila,blush & bronze hydro-blur cheek duo,pimprod2042663,2617321," * I love the color combination of this product and how its sheer and can't mess it up. I ordered the grapefruit pink combo and its amazing. * Loving this creamy blush! * Obsessed. It is easy to use, compact, travels well and convenient! Definitely will be buying in other colors as well. * The blush is very pretty but the contour part came smushed and once i turned the tube to bring product down it completely fell off the tube. Not my favorite for my first time trying this product * I have fallen in love with this duo! I got Grapefruit/Caramel and the colors are amazing! Super creamy and easily blends. The case is cute and works great and the product lasts a long time even with daily use! * Love this hybrid gel cheek duo * I purchased the Grapefruit and Caramel color. I tried it out with my fingers and a brush.

The good;
-Pretty colors. They swatch mat but do blend out sheer and become part of the skin. 
-Elegant formulation with a creamy and light feel on the skin. 
-Easy to use, compact and portable.
-No discernable scent. 
-Neither the bronzer nor the blush have any glowy particles. 

The not so good;
-I am fair but cool toned and ALL the colors are warm on me. Why Stila, why? 
-Once applied the blush and bronzer become sheer and the colors disappear as they blend in. 
-I had to do multiple layers before I could truly see any color payoff.
I am tempted to purchase a darker color combination just so it would show up. 

Overall this is a clever, very convenient, and  portable product. Perhaps great for on the go touchups. But it is so sheer and blends out on my skin so much that there is virtually nothing left."
18,nars,afterglow liquid blush,pimprod2039276,2617037," * I bought the Orgasm color. I've received so many compliments! It doesnt fade as quick as some other high end brands. * So easy to apply. Im trying to wear make up beyond a tinted foundation at 40 and am loving this blush! * Very blendable and easy to use. The color orgasm rush was really pretty and had a shimmer and glow to it. If you're having a day when you want to skip bronzer and highlighter this is good for that. A little goes a long way. * I bought this in the color Aragon and it's described as a warm chestnut brown but it's definitely more red than brown. At first when I applied it was really dark but blended out to almost nothing. After using it a few more times I did enjoy the light flush that it gives the cheeks but it doesn't justify the price, good thing I got this during their sale. The packaging is very shiny and chic. * This is the blush I've been looking for.  I'm on my second tube and LOVE it. * This is a beautiful product for anyone looking for the most MINIMAL color to the cheeks. It feels like you are putting water on your face. It blended out to the lightest wash of color with the most beautiful glow. The glow can even been seen under powder. I am someone who wants a pop of color. I'm not a subtle blush gal, so this does not fit my preference. At the end of the day it is still a beautiful product, but I can't justify the price point personally. I bought this during 21 days. I got the Lilac shade. * I'm fair with dark brown hair (same complexion and contrast as Anne Hathaway) . Dolce Vita is the most perfect blush color i've ever used. This blush blends like a dream and lasts all day. Best blush I've ever used!"

Color os gorgeous but when I would go to blend it with other go to products it just did not work for me. I ended up giving it a away to a younger cousin who likes to play with makeup. * This blush is SO good for a natural look. If you have mature and dry skin,this blush is for you! I have the colors petal poppin(soft pink)and peach face(soft peach). Peach face is my favorite! It is very natural looking on me! * Beautiful and soft blush. I like the color and it is easy to use and blend. * I love this blush profoundly. Its more expensive than the blush products i was using before. But its so worth the cost. A little goes such a long way and theyre so creamy i just love them. * I totally got the wrong shade for my skin tone with my first purchase - it was a little too orangey for everyday wear, which is absolutely on me. This time, I got the coral and I am eagerly awaiting its arrival - the formula is really really nice, probably my favorite blush I own (even over Milk's!) If you're looking for a really nice cream blush - this is the way to go! * I got the Fuego blush, and the color is beautiful, but there is too much glitter in it  for me, I prefer a more natural look. I might use it as an eyeshadow instead because I love the color so much. * Glides on smoothly, color is vibrant and can be muted. I am sixty and cannot believe how easy it is to apply."

22,tarte,blush tape liquid blush,pimprod2038505,2610305," * I love blushes and have tried..a LOT. And i was surprised to see negative reviews because this one is stunning. pigmented, glowy, blendable, smoothe & long-lasting. everything i could hope for! I have 3 shades and all are chefs kiss 🤌 * I returned this product after using it twice because I didn't like the shimmer and color. I have fair skin and didn't pick a color that complimented me. But I didn't exchange it for a different color because of the shimmer. I like a little glow, but the shimmer overpowered the color. I did like the applicator tip, which is why I bought this product. It was easy to apply to my skin and somewhat ok with blending. It was a little difficult to blend out the imprint of the circle after I dabbed it on my face. * I bought this because of all the ads on instagram and I am so glad I did.  It's a beautiful glowy finish that's easy to apply and blend. * Tried this and I was generous with how much I used. It blended out to nothing but shimmer. * Blends well with makeup brush! Great colors. * Love the shade. But you have to be careful if you are fair or light skin tone as it's little bit darker shade. One dot is enough. * The formula is not great. Its quite patchy and moves around a lot if you touch your face at all, even with setting spray. I use it sometimes because the color 'cherry' is beautiful and it is a true red that doesn't blend to pink or orange. For that reason I'm willing to work with it sometimes. But if I could find something that was the same color and a different product, I would definitely use that."
23,polite society,polite pops powder blush stick,pimprod2044285,2620621," * Its a nice product but not worth the price! For the price i would go with other high end products. Its easy to carry with you but you do have to re apply often, too often in my opinion for a blush. * I have the shade Los Angeles which is a stunning bubblegum pink (my favorite). I tried to use my blush brush directly and it wouldnt pick up any product. So you have to use your fingers, possibly a sponge. But it feels so dry and powdery, not at all creamy. This makes it very hard to blend over makeup. For the price, the formula is not worth it. Cool packaging though * I am regular to oily skin combo and have added this on top of powders and foundations and it looks so natrual withoit disturbing my base makeup. I am cool toned and colors pull orange on me but the color Sydney looks so natrual. I bought two other blushes i have never tried and havent even opened them because this one just goes on so effortlessly and looks just as good at the end of my day. Also, this is the fourth review I have done on my life, that is how much I love this product. I am 41 so its great for maturing skin. * I love the concept, but for me these are kind of hard to work with and do think there's a learning curve. I tried these with and without a base and was not impressed. Without makeup, it immediately sunk into my pores. With makeup, it completely lifted everything under it. I'm still playing around with them as it could've been the the other products rather than this, but I have my doubts. In my opinion, they are overhyped. I got them on sale, thankfully, and won't return as I am adamant about trying to figure them out, but I most likely would not repurchase. * I  would not purchase this brand again.  I've had several others that are creamier and go on much easier than PS.  Also, I do not think that it lasts as long as others. * This is just the right size, I love the packaging. Colors blend beautifully just as described. Highly recommended and will be traveling with me this summer. * So simple to apply and blend with fingers. I use malibu to give a healthy subtle glow to my cheeks. Would purchase again!"

Im sure its a beautiful color, but theyre both broken to the point where i cannot even use them at least once. Im returning both unfortunately. * This blush is absolutely beautiful!! Not only do I glow to the gods but it lasts!! I literally plan on buying them all!! * The texture freaked me out at first, but it's so light and creamy. It's great for my older skin. * At a certain point, I moved from powder to creme blush and I've tried most, this at the top. I apply this formula with a beauty blender and it goes on so well. Application is easy and the color (blush please) is subtle and perfect on my light to medium color skin. My only complaint? I'd love to see more colors! * I was searching for a product that blends easily and stays on...this is it * Bought this on a whim and loved it so much that i bought 2 more!! Blush please is my favorite on my fair skin for everyday, but they're all great! I put them over powder and they don't disrupt anything underneath, and they give my cheeks a very subtle but healthy glow. The blend is seamless and they have great lasting power with me working a 12 hour shift!! Highly recommend, these deserve more hype! * I have used SO MANY different blushes, but this one I can't get over! I got it in the shade blush please which given my fair completion, shows up more peachy. Its creamy, but works beautifully on both bare skin and powder which is why I love it!"
25,smashbox,halo sculpt + glow face palette with vitamin e,pimprod2042910,2618546," * Don't waste your money! The colors are not pigmented. * ❤️❤️❤️❤️ * I bought the Back to Cali palette and it's my perfect everyday work palette. It's so easy, I do my makeup in 15min and it looks so beautiful and natural. I have light neutral skin and it gives me a healthy natural flush. It comes with an intert on how to apply the 4 products in the palette which I always follow. I love it! It does have a bit of an odd smell which isn't my favorite but the payoff is so good I can ignore it. * I bought and returned this palette. The smell was sooo offputting. Like rancid oil. Im not sure why because it is a newer palette. * I actually like these colors! They all work for my skincare. But - and big but here - this smells awful. Like old, expired even? I can't use it because i hate the smell so much. And it is a little smaller than i expected, hard to get a brush into one pan. * zero pigment. i had to build it up like crazy to see anything show and when i looked at myself after a couple hours, the powders were no where to be seen. no staying power * I love the two blushes and the highlighter! They have great pigment and the highlighter sits nice. No glitter!

The bronzer however is not very pigmented. I tried to build it up but it fell short"
26,bareminerals,gen nude blonzer blush + bronzer,pimprod2031864,2594966," * I got two of these blushes during the 21 Days of Beauty sale and WOW, have they been great! The color is just the right amount of pigment, it does add a natural warmth to my skin without too much bronzer look (how does it do that?!), and with some UD All Nighter spray on top, it stays in place for most of the day. These are super nice. * Use this as blush and eye shadow * Obsessed with how it looks and feel. * I have very fair skin. I dont think these were meant for people like me. Its very pigmented and looks heavy. Really hard to blend. Ive tried many different ways of applying it but nothing has worked. It always looks muddy. It has not worked for my needs. * I actually bought this color even though im pretty fair right now and only ever get  to a medium and im really, really happy i did. Its a perfect bronze and hightlight, with the slighest (perfect imo) hint of a blush. Im not a huge blush girl but ive hit my ""wth is happening in my 40s to my face/body"" and I actually do need a little more color. 
This is it for me. It takes a few dips to get where i want it, and its just lovely. Really. I would have given it 5 stars except i dont think it lasted as long as some makup. But the tradeoff for such a pretty color is well worth it. Actually I give that star back nvm * Absolutely love the way this product warms up my face without being too bronzey. I'm very pale and struggle to find complexion products that don't turn me orange. I finally found my perfect powder blush! * OMG! Love this product. I was pleasantly surprised with how beautiful it goes on and looks. Stays on all day and very buildable. Got so many compliments. Bought 2 colors. Definitely might go to now."
27,tarte,amazonian clay 12-hour blush,pimprod2043868,2618995," * So sad at the formula change. The shade captivating has been my go-to shade for years and it was a perfect warm peachy shade and would last forever. It's so much lighter now (completely different color) and much less pigmented. Will be looking at other brands. * Nice finish. I like that it does not go on heavy so I can control the color better. * I had received small sample size in the product and loved the color.  The larger size allows much more coverage with the blush brush.  Very subtle and classy. * I love the color selection first off, but they have definitely reformulated because this used to last me so long as I only needed a little bit, now I have to scrape product off with something so I get any pay off at all, I even have to dig into it with a brush because I get NO color, not worth it anymore, formula is chalky and no pigment even with finger swatch * Hard to find make up for sensitive skin. Love the brand. * Just love this blush. It stays on all day. Blushing Bride is my favorite shade. * I have purchased the pink ones for years and loved.  They just reformulated, last time I bought my staple it was a different color, smaller size, and absolutely no color payoff.  Like I couldnt get the powder on to my brush.  No longer applys well to face.  Wasted money on a product I trusted and am now moving to another brand. Cannot use product."

I have been using it for about a week and you can already tell that it lost alot of product and i'm not a full face girly either. I will stick to Rare Beauty liquid blush next time! It last forever. * Ok. I love the contouring wand. I am light to medium in in skintone. O tan in the summer. This blush is Amazing.. i have tried the other designer brands but they were all sticky and hard to blend.  This product hands down is worth every penny. Quality. I got the regular pillow talk matte color. It is buildable and beautiful. * It's hard to blend * Love this blush. Color, application, matte finish & wear are are all 5/5. Only con is applicator gets messy. Pillow talk is universally flattering but very flattering for brown hair/eye coloring * Love this blush. Color, application, matte finish & wear are are all 5/5. Only con is applicator gets messy. Pillow talk is universally flattering but very flattering for brown hair/eye coloring * love this blush!!!! * I absolutley do not like how messy the packaging gets, but im in love with the formula. I got the pillow talk one, and it looks so beautiful on my skin.  It's definitley buildable, so it worked well during the summer when i was more tan, and it works well now that my skin is light. The formula is sophisticated.... It makes my cheecks look glowy, without any shimmer.  It also lasts all day on my oily skin. It's such a joy to use (i even use it over my powder with no issues), and i find myself forcing myself to use my other blushes."

I really like it and this is the second time I bought it. * This blush is perfect it looks so nice on and is good for the price! Very pigmented and looks stunning on. I also use this brand because they are cruelty free!!! * I wear this product in the shade ""New To U"", and it's fine. The color is very pretty and I like how buildable it is. I typically have to reapply it if I'm going to be wearing my makeup from more than 2-3 hours, but I don't personally mind that. My biggest gripe with this product is the packaging, as the plastic hinges on the compact lid wear down easily and eventually break off, leaving the pan and the lid in two separate pieces. It makes storing/traveling with this product impossible without it recieving (at least) minor damage. If you're looking for a Colourpop blush, I reccommend the super shcok formula or the cream blush sticks instead. * I went to replace my broken Prairie Air and since i last purchased in the fall, its been reformulated and is a completely different shade! So disappointing ive been wearing this color for years. * For a cheaper product this has so much pigment, and stays put all day. * I dont love it but i dont hate it. Maybe I need to try a different color but the color I chose wasn't pigmented. The color seemed….flat. Ordered color ""To the 10"" for my fair skin with warm undertones. It's not my go-to. * I am very choosy about what colors I put on my cheeks. Normally, I will go with something a little bit more softer and Less pink. But using this along with my peachy pink lipstick. It gives me a summary Sunkist look. Which is Something I wanted to do for a while. Absolutely love this color. It's very Pigmented so you only need a little bit."

Its great * I loved the pigmentation and the color. * This is supposed to be a luxury brand and product but the packaging and compact are so cheap. Both blush and highlighter not adhered to pan then continued to crumble.  I have purchased so many Charlotte Tilbury products, some great products but rendered unusable by the cheap packaging.  CT is marketed as luxury however there are so many better luxury brands at same (or lower) price point with both exceptionally good product and packaging. CT needs review her product packaging, if the product is broken to the point of being unusable or messy people will go elsewhere. I know im done * I gave one star because of the e color, the light pink blush is pigmented and pretty on as is the highlighter. 
However for a Charlotte Tillbury product, supposedly lux, i would not expext the product to fall out of the pan upon opening the compact and be broken up.  Its obviously not a packaging error as im seeing it repeatedly in reviews that every brand new Hollywood Blush & Go palette has this problem no mattet where its purchased from. I have ised the sculpt and glow set for yeara and never had this issue, its just this blush and glow set with the highlighter loose from pallet's * Amazing product! The blush and highlighter are so pretty and last on me all day * No shine no pigment i was looking for a cute blush set * The blush is far to pigmented for my preference. It makes me feel like a clown. If you like a lot of pigment this is a great choice though!
I love the highlighter!"

I hope this product hasnt been used because there was no seal on it either. Very disappointed. * Super good pricing and smells great! I don't have too much money to spend here and there so I had to find a dupe for benetint but I love this more than benetint ! Great color and price. But make sure to blend it quickly, it is a tint and will dry out * Everyone kept telling me this was a great dupe for the benefit brand and I had to come & say that it is even better! The color last ALL day. It is super easy to blend, but be aware it is very pigmented so go easy. I will forever recommend this product to anyone who asks! * As someone who has used bene tint which I like I was so impressed with the Essence tint that this is going to be my new go to.  It has a little more pink then bene tint, but stays on much longer. Wow so much more affordable. I use it as a blush putting a few drops on a small plastic lid and dab my brush and this gives me the perfect natural blush that stays all day. Very happy with this product will be buying more. * I absolutely loveeee this stuff! Its a super cute pink, you can add more if you want more pigment, it smells soooo good, and i personally think that its better than Benetint. * This was so good! So much kess to waste than the real thing! My smelled so good like rassberries! It stained for sure! Tip: try it as a lip liner works so well! * Good good good"

The colors are beautiful! The application is a dream and they give just that perfect flush of color! I purchased two shades and showed the line to my friend and she bought one. I do think it is overpriced but, as it should last a long time, I bit the bullet and bought it anyway. As I get older, I have decided become far more intentional in what I buy. The products I chose are generally more high end but, as a I end of with far fewer just tossed in a drawer, I think it is more cost effective in the end. * In love * Pretty color. Does the job. Too expensive. * I have light olive skin and often have difficulty finding colors that aren't too warm or cool. Lychee is perfect! Lasts all day while also managing to look natural. Does not highlight acne texture. The dimethicone in many blushes breaks me out and it's hard to find a product without it these days, happy to find this! It's expensive with the compact, so glad refills are available. * I love this blush. It's a nice buildable formula so it works for a subtle work look and nights out."

This product gives you a perfect sun, kissed glow with a little bit of a blushing effect as well. The brush is a perfect compliment to the product. * How many of us older ladies, I'm 60, have spent $$$ on cream or liquid blush? I've tried them all. Bought this 1/2 off to try it. Wowzer.  It's VERY pigmented. Dip your brush or sponge gently into the pot, brush it on the back of your hand to distribute evenly then apply. Amazing. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Great pigment but I didn't love the products color with my skin tone (light/medium). The color did last throughout the day and blended well. Overall it's a great product, just not the right one for me. * I love love this blush. It blends very nicely and is very pigmented * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This creamy blush is amazing. This is my first time using this style. A little goes a long way, which makes it last longer! I wish I had went a shade darker but it's still a pretty color. I used Sun Blossom 20. I love the glass container! * This is a perfect blush...easy to brush on, buildable, great for mature, sensitive skin. It gives a natural glow with no cakey feel or look.  Kudos to IT for coming up with this one. * I have no idea how there aren't more people talking about these! They're absolutely amazing! The formula reminds me a lot of the phytosurgence blushes. These are super creamy and really pigmented, almost a cream to powder which I love because that means they won't stay wet on the cheeks. This is definitely an underrated product for sure. I ended up with 3 colors in the 21 days of beauty sale. Theyre so perfect for a sunkissed blush look for spring and summer."
38,bobbi brown,pot rouge blush for lips & cheeks,pimprod2038538,2583677," * What's not to love about this blush, pigmented, creamy, glowy, does not cause any irritation amd layers well for reapplication. For reference have this in the shade Powder Pink a gorgeous, subtle pinky brown shade which works so well on my Indian skintone. Please introduce some brown tone shades,please!!! * I love the color of Coral Calypso, it blends beautifully, it can be layered for a deeper pop of color and it lasts all day. I put it on at 5am and then when I get home at 6pm, its still there. I have super oily skin and live in a humid AF environment as well. So, I'm blotting my face at least twice a day with oil blotter sheets and it survives it. Disclaimer: I do use the Porefessional matte setting spray to set my face so that also attributes to its longevity. * This is a beautiful blush that blends out like a dream. I am normally not a fan of crème blush. I have never tried Bobbi Brown makeup before so will be trying more of her products. * Really great color pay off. Nice formula that plays well with powders and long lasting. Would purchase again for sure. * Love this. Her products are amazing. * This is my first Bobbi Brown item and I love it! Beautiful color, blends easily, and stays on all day, even with my oily skin. Most other blushes, powder or cream, do not stand up against oily skin. And a little goes a long way. Will definitely order more colors. * Velvet Plum was described as a cool berry but had strong brown undertones. Not a berry color at all.
Didn't go on smoothly - very blotchy and hard to blend.
Price is way too high for size of pot.
Not a good value or a good blush - going back."

It looks natural like you had a sun kissed day outside in the sunshime. * I ordered the mauve and merlot shades in this blush as a light to medium neutral to warm girly.  The merlot shade will give you the most belivable and flattering blush, amd the mauve is a close second.  Pleasr don't sleep on this smooth and long lasting blush that will elevate your makeup game!  I will never repurchase another brand as long as this is available.  10/10 stars!

It goes on well straight on the cheek or using a blush. Long lasting and very pretty! I got the shade soft rose and it looks very natural on my fair skin. * Absolutely love the Brush this Blush come with and the Blush itself Blends amazingly! * I got this blush in the shade dahlia. The color is gorgeous and it adds such a good layer to my makeup! Would definitely recommend for a buildable easy blush!

41,maybelline,sunkisser multi-use liquid blush,pimprod2045294,2624893," * I had this in the baby pink shade(can't remember the name) and the city sizzle shade. I have very fair cool/neutral skin that is typically dry. The baby pink shade was very pretty but definitely not pigmented enough for darker skin tones I would imagine. The City Sizzle shade is a sunburnt sort of color which isn't something I'd usually pick and frankly doesn't look very harmonious on me but my biggest issue is the ENORMOUS particles of glitter. I mean straight up silver craft glitter- maybe this visually blends more for people with darker skin tones but I have genuinely never used a blush that is this glittery. It takes away from the natural sunburnt look (if that's what you're going for) definitely a pass for me * Ok so this thing is like Waterproof! I swatched some of my other cream blushes, and even after using soap and water, this one stayed on my arm :). 

I was gifted the shade uptown glow and it is such a cute carrot-y shade with golden shimmer. I was  worried at first bc when I put it on my cheeks it was a bit patchy so I tried blending it out on the back of my hand first and that did the trick! I also add more directly onto the cheeks once the initial layer is laid down and blend it with a sponge so it's definitely buildable :). Maybe 2-3 layers? I think some ppl might not like it as much bc it gives more of a ""watercolor effect"" on the cheeks. If you're looking for rare beauty or Juvia's place pigment, this is not it, but if you're a subtle/sheer blush or ""gym"" kinda gal, I think you'll love it! * its a decent liquid blush that blends well when theres not a ton of other liquid makeup on the face already. i like to use this for days i just wear concealer and mascara. not sure if i would use this for a full face due to the texture and consistency. the color is vibrant! * its a decent liquid blush that blends well when theres not a ton of other liquid makeup on the face already. i like to use this for days i just wear concealer and mascara. not sure if i would use this for a full face due to the texture and consistency. the color is vibrant! * It is not overly pigmented with shimmer particles.

HOWEVER, it started crumbling apart in the pan. it's never been dropped. I have never traveled with it. it lives in my vanity drawer. every time I open it, it has just fallen apart more ! for the price of this product this is unacceptable. * Not packaged well at all. The blush came completely shattered. Disappointing, I wouldn't order this online from Ulta. * This blush is very build-able. I admit I was a little nervous when I first applied it and saw that it was faint, but after a few more swatches it built up into a beautiful shade. The blush lasted on my skin all day! (I have dry skin, I don't know if that helps) I genuinely think this is one of the best blushes on the market, you can tone it up or down and it looks so high quality! I'd say it's worth the hefty price tag! * I genuinely love this product for MY routine. I do bronzer so i need a nice blush to compliment it. This product works amazing over a liquid blush and it adds a nice sheer color ontop of the liquid blush. * I would love to write only good things about this blush because I really like the color and it suits my complexion. Its pillow talk. However, the quality and durability are really disappointing. The product is combined with a highlighter inside, and it cracked after just a few uses. It didn't fall anywhere, I kept it in my cabinet with other cosmetics. * Pillow Talk blush packaging is very pretty and the blush itself coordinates well with the matching lipstick shade. Unfortunately, the blush barely shows up on my skin. Even when I use a heavy hand when applying it, it just looks like I put a ton of highlighter on my cheeks. Poor pigmentation, especially for the price. (For reference, I wear the shade M1 Punjab Nars foundation.) Maybe this will show up well if you have very fair skin. * I llve this blush, unfortunately Ulta could have done better with packaging. Product arrived cracked and made a huge mess when i removed itsm from package."
43,bareminerals,gen nude highlighting blush,pimprod2039778,2611433," * I purchased this blush to give my cheeks a little shimmer compared to my matte blush. The photo of the product (and the actual product) appear light pink. However, when I applied it to my cheeks, it had more of a light orange tone. I wouldn't consider it ""mauve"" as the color description states. Then, when I was on a Zoom video call and saw myself the screen, the ""orange"" was amplified, which was bit of an unpleasant surprise to me. I ended up returning this blush. I wish this product came in more shades that have more of a pink hue. * Love bareMinerals, been using this product for 20 years!! * Awesome  shimmer * Love this shimmer  blush. Works so good * I've been using Bare Minerals for years. New favorite blush. Just the right amount of color. * I fell in love with this blush ghe moment i put it on.

44,fenty beauty by rihanna,hot cheeks velour blushlighter,pimprod2045516,2625693," * idk why the other reviews are complaining about too much glittler/sparkle when its called blushlighter. its meant to have some sparkle. it's absolutely gorg and just gives such a beautiful glow to your skin. i dont think it brings out a bunch of texture either. i wish it would let me insert a picture so you could see its not overly sparkly, just a pretty glow. you probably dont even need highlighter with this but im extra and always add the fenty diamond bomb. id def reccomend this * really loved fhe packaging and color of the blush but the color does not pick up at all on a brush or beauty blender. you really have to pack it on but it looks streaky after applying so much. milani has a better glowy blush. * I dont understand all the bad reviews. These blushes are gorgeous.  I have Juicy Peach and it is gorgeous on the skin, great color for a pop of peach pink on cheeks!   Yes it has some glitter but not a crazy amount.  I highly recommend! * I have a medium-tan skin tone and I couldn't decide which shade to purchase so I got both Juicy Peach and Baked Peach. They are very similar so you definitely don't need both. Juicy Peach doesn't have a lot of base pigment, it is more like a ""blush topper"", however the glow that it gives the cheeks is stunning, like a peachy/gold reflect. Baked Peach definitely has more of a base color, more like an actual blush. Baked Peach is more pink, the reflect is pink instead of gold. They are both very pretty, depends what look you're going for. I would say even someone with a lighter skin tone could use the darkest shade, as I had to build up to get it to show up (aka not a scary blush) * I love this product for the shimmering glow and rich peach tone! I enjoy the sparkle and it applied easily. I bought the darkest shade. * I got the shade Fresh Peach. It is stunning. Perfect for fair to light skin tones if you want that beautiful light pink flush with gold highlights. When I put it on, it just lights up my face so perfectly with a beautiful glow. I love this and want to get the other colors. Can't get enough. * I wanted to love this so bad because I love the packaging. It looks beautiful in the pan but absolutely no pigment shows up on my face. I bought the lightest shade and tried to build it many times and I ended up really just looking kind of orange with all the gold glitter. Not flattering on my light/medium skin.

The blush is so smooth and blends seamlessly. The component is sleak and since its magnetic, never opens when i dont want it to open. * This is one of the best POWDER blushes, mature skin approved and dry skin approved!! Im over 35. The finish is satin and soft. If you can't do cream blushes i recommend these!! The formula is chefs kiss!! * Its an amazing formula, super gentle, and buildable. Offers good coverage and the color ""Rose on Mars"" is the perfect neutral mauve pink color. * I don't normally write reviews nor am I someone who has caught on to the blush trend. However, these blushes are beautiful. Pigmented enough to show up on dark skin, but blendable, buildable and natural looking. Had a celeb makeup artist use this on me from my collection and he loved them as well. I own four of them and plan on grabbing another shade! * This is such a pigmented blush! It applies great and I use it everyday! * You can build it up so easily which I loveeee! Reminds me of diors blushes !!! It really builds up to its name, I currently only own strawberry nebula but I will purchase more colors !"

Beautiful color selection. Blend quickly, these set fast. * The pictures don't do this blush justice. Absolutely stunning and now one of my favorites. I will get another shade. I hope they carry this forever! * I love this product because I can use it on my lips, cheek, and eyes. A little goes a VERY long way so I feel like I have a life-time supply. I plan to purchase some of the other colors. * I suffer from acne and greasy skin.  i didnt know it was a blushligher so thats my fault. I wore with matte makeup expecting a regular liquid blish and was upset how greasy i looked as well as it accentuâting my acne bumps. Would definitely recommend to someone who loves a glowy look, not full glam, and a pigmented look. very vibrant in color. Just didnt like on myself. * This blush has an amazing pigment and glow combination. I get so many compliments on this blish. * the blush was pigmented but didn't blend well at all, I only used it once for my birthday and wanted to cry because it wouldn't blend. the color itself was splotchy and the glitter wouldn't move * the blush was pigmented but didn't blend well at all, I only used it once for my birthday and wanted to cry because it wouldn't blend. the color itself was splotchy and the glitter wouldn't move"

I loveee the color it changed to and the texture isn't too sticky or tacky! My only concern is that it doesn't last too long. After 30 minutes or so it starts to fade so you might need to reapply during the day. * I was excited to try this, but was sadly disappointed.  The color stayed the same almost clear color as in the bottle. No  change at all.  Just an oily look with no color.  Tried 2 bottles and neither changed color - at all! * I got this prodct on a whim expecting the color to be too dark for my very pale skin. I was pleasantly surpried by the sheer buildable finish, making it easy to control the pigment and prevent it from being too dark. It blends like a dream and layers perfectly with my powder blush on top. Lasts throughout the day. * This product is terrible, patchy and caused breakouts. Youre betted off rubbing mud on your face. * I'm always weary about products like this, when I've tried ph lip gloss i wasn't a fan of how pink it turned my lips, but this blush looks amazing, very natural, complimentary shade on my skin tone. Didn't need much, and blended well. * The product didn't apply evenly on my face. It felt greasy, like applying oil, and didn't last long at all. * I truly wonder if people associate me with my love of blush as they do with my blunt bangs. Blush has always been my favorite makeup. And I've used it all! The powders, the creams, the gels… but this became my obsession!! So easy to apply, so natural looking as it fully blends in vs sitting on the skin. I've gifted to many friends (and my mom!) because it works for everyone! Love how easy and beautiful it is!!"

This blush is just the ticket.  It has buildable color and looks very natural when applied. * This formula is incredible and I honestly prefer it to my high end cream blushes (makeup by mario, haus labs). It applies so smoothly over foundation, and even on top of powders. The color is easily buildable. Nude kiss is the perfect blonzer shade. Milani come out with more shades of this - lavander or true hot pink!!!!! * The is the perfect blush color, it is so pigmented and I barely tap my brush and so much pigment gets picked up. * Very creamy, blends well, and the colors are beautiful. It just doesn't last long but I'd still recommend it to someone going for a more natural look. * as a teenage girl, the only thing i use at the moment is blush and bronzer just because i feel pale since its winter, i love this blush!! i have lots of blush and this is one of my favorites! my #1 will always be the rode pocket blush but honestly this is a close second. its creamy, pigmented, easy to blend and i looovvveeee the color!!! * This is a great blush. Applies beautifully, lasts long and has great pigment. My one gripe is that the packaging is not sturdy and twice now the lid has broken off."
54,l'orÃ©al,lumi le liquid blush,pimprod2045480,2625628," * Tried this on my hand in store and was so impressed, super glowy and loved the color. This is no doubt an amazing highlighter and I use it on my nose everyday, but if you have any other liquid product on underneath, if not carfuel this will take it off underneath and give it a splotchy area. I have had to redo my makeup several times. Good product by itself, not good with others * The first time I applied this, I put on too much. It goes a long, long way. One not-too-huge dot on my cheek provides enough product to cover the cheek apple. I dot in the middle and spread it by swirling around in a target shape, blending so there is no border. It's very easy to blend and the color is what I expected when applied. * I love the shade, Worth It (601). I purchased the lipstick and lip oil/gloss in 601 and wanted the liquid blush as well. I went in-store to purchase, and the blush color looks pale orange. It a totally differet shade altogether. * So hydrating yet has a crisp beautiful color. * I have the 605 Dewey Pink since that appears to be the only cool toned shade. It blends easily and looks hydrating but not too shiny. Pigment needs to be build up  a little but that's fine. * I found this harder to blend and get a pretty look than any other liquid blush I have tried, it eventually got there, but it was more work than most other simiar products. Perhaps it was just the shade I tried * The Lumi Liquid Blush is Dewy Bright Pink is an extremely highly pigmented liquid blush with a sophisticated, non-occlusive formula that delivers buildable color without trapping heat or creating heaviness. It's a minimal, clean formula, and layers beautifully with other products, but due to its intense pigmentation, it's best to apply it with a very light hand and built up gradually for the most natural finish.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ It looks absolutely beautiful when I under-paint with it. Highly recommend."
55,chanel,joues contraste powder blush,pimprod2030016,2579895," * The blush doesnt have any pigment ots powdery and the amount of product you get is noth worth the price. * The texture is very soft with finely milled pearl similar to the Hourglass pressed powders. It has a ""lit from within"" look thats not going to emphasize textute. I got it in the color Jersey which is between a rose and warm nutmeg. The blush is a light wash of color that can be built up, but its not designed for vibrancy. Great for those who want a natural blush thats not shimmery or completely matte. I find the color and texture true to luxury makeup. It has longevity, and stays on my skin through an 8 hour work day. 

If youre not into subtle formulas then this isnt for you. There are more vibrant blushes that costs a fraction of the price. If you enjoy luxury makeup or like ultra milled baked powder then this could be an option. * I like this color and texture * I love this !! Its flirty not to bright not to dark it's perfect for those that have olive under tone! * While I wanted to love this blush, I found the coverage was minimal unless I use ALOT of product.  For the price, I won't buy again. * I love this blush! A nice natural glow feels amazing and last a long time. I will definitely buy again * Perfect everyday blush - give perfect amout of pigment and the packaging is very chic :)"
56,revolution beauty,superdewy liquid blush,pimprod2024993,2583413," * Love the color of this liquid blush. * Love the color of this liquid blush. * The size of product * So affordable, pigmented and not talked about enough!! I got the hot pink shade, squeeze a tiny amount on the back of yohr hand then stipple brush to even distribute. Super buildable and doesnt get patchy!!! * Returned as unusable. Color was not very pigmented, but more importantly, this formula proved really problematic for my sensitive cheeks. * I thought this would be too bright when I first squeezed it out. Using just a little gives me a nice peachy flush that lasts all day. It's buildable too if I want a bit of a brighter color. * Bought ""Fake the Flush"" because I needed to add something to get to a specific total. Its amazingly beautiful, blends so easily, not super pigmented ( with blushes, in my opinion, there's a thing as too much pigment  ) and less than $2.00, I was not expecting to love it like I do."
57,jane iredale,just kissed lip and cheek stain,pimprod2004095,2544987," * I didnt realize this was listed as a stain - not really.  I consider it like a moisturizing balm with a little bit of ph changing color to it.  Good for days off, a little color, or on the go application without a mirror (forever pink) bought full size after trying the tiny one in a free gift from ulta * I had high hopes, but was thoroughly disappointed.
I wouldn't consider this a ""stain."" I've honestly gotten better stain results with Burt's Bees Tinted Lip Balm and that was not the intended use...it just happened. * This product in Forever Peach was super hyped on social media. I thought it was a sure thing because I love peachy/coral shades on my lips....this wasn't that. This was florescent orange, in the tube and on my lips. It ""self adjusted"" to a slightly less florescent orange but not by much. The scent was meh as well, kinda plasticky and just not pleasant. I enjoy most of my other Jane Iredale products but this was a miss for sure. * As a lip balm it's not moisturizing and doesn't last. As a stain it barely shows (got the pink) and doesn't last. I get more moisture and color from my drugstore stains/balms. You're just paying for the packaging and brand. I don't recommend. * I've used Forever Pink for at least 5 years and bought a new tube recently. The color is not the same, it used to be a beautiful cool pink on me, now it's a warm pink, just not flattering anymore and the sweet smell is a noticeable change too. I'm tremendously upset and disappointed. Please bring back the old version!!! * Love this product, but hate the new white packaging. i love the previoud silver. The white matte color looks cheap, and get dirty fast. * I love this lip stain! It's a beautiful pink color that's unique to me. I love that I can either have it a soft natural pink or make it a darker pink with applying more layers."
58,hourglass,ambient lighting blush,pimprod2020426,2575935," * I have this blush in shade ""at night"" and it compliments my pale cool toned skin surprisingly well. * Hourglass finishing powders are amazing do I had high hopes for this blush but honestly it didn't give much color and isn't worth the $. Ultimately I return this. * I've used Mood Exposure as my daily blush for a long time; it's one of only two blushes I have ever 100% used up because I loved it so much. (The other was a limited edition from LORAC). Mood Exposure is a plummy brown color that just makes my fair to light skin look a bit sunkissed and blushing. It doesn't scream BLUSH. The mix of the ambient lighting powder also smoothes out my skintone visually and hide some fine lines. :) If you have a deeper skin tone, you'll need either a heavier hand or to try out a color like At Night or their magenta one for more color payoff. The full size blush lasted through 525 uses with a brush, so even if used every day it will last you over a year. I also used one as a topper to set cream blushes in place and that one lasted for many years! It may be expensive up front but wait for a coupon bc you will get a TON of uses out of this product. * I have most of the blushes. The newest that I purchased is At Night described as Brick Red. It's very pigmented and a beautiful flush of red on the cheeks. * I didn't understand the hype or the price point till I tried it myself. It's just so smooth and buttery and gives a beautiful finish on the cheeks * I've had this blush in diffused heat for years - it is my go-to. Looks a little dewy and very natural, easy to blend and wear, it also lasts a long time. I recently purchased At Night and it goes on much patchier, never had that issue with the other color. But it blends out ok. These are pretty pigmented IMO, but then I don't wear super heavy blush. It's good for someone who wants something more natural looking. A little pricy. * Terrible product with zero color payoff"
59,ulta beauty collection,too cheeky lip & cheek color stick,pimprod2015889,2556122," * I've really enjoyed using this lip and cheek cream so far. I love that the color is light enough for my cheeks, but dark enough for my lips to give me some good color. It's really blendable and stays on my cheeks very well. It doesn't stay as long on my lips, but I am OK with that. * Really nice concept - I like the applicator a lot. It blends well. My issue is that it does not last at all when doing a full face. May be better off using it bare face/light makeup. I received this to leave an honest review. * This color in particular looks great on my skin during the summer, and it could also work for fall, but I'll have to wait and see. It blends seamlessly into the skin to achieve a natural look, but can be built up for a brighter and bolder appearance. The stick itself is a bit dry, so I have to warm it up on my hand to make it more blendable and easier to apply. The pigment, like I said, can be buildable, so that's a great factor, and it didn't cause any adverse reaction to my skin. * This product is very versatile! It doubles as cheek and lip color! I love the fact is doesn't add to the oiliness of my skin and it blends great! I used it on both my lips and my cheeks and got quite a few compliments. I am definitely going to try a few more shades in the near future! * So creamy and blends like butter! I love that it can be used on the cheeks and lips. Hint: you can also use it as an eyeshadow! * I love a good color stick. The formula applies smoothly and is easy to blend. You get a natural flush that is buildable. It can also be used as a lip color, but I prefer it for cheeks only. It is a good staple item for a natural, everyday look. * I would absolutely recommend this product to others. The color is beautiful and left a nice pretty highlight on my cheeks did not break out. My skin was very easy to apply and just as easy to remove. Very pretty colors. Wasn't too heavy on the skin."
60,colourpop,hydrating blush stix,pimprod2009396,2550449," * The beauty consultant that helped was right on with color match. It's a great product and much easier to use than powder. * 10/10 recommended. The color is great and it feels amazing. Easy to blend and can make lighter or darker. * This is such a great product! I have a fair (but not pale) skin color with cool neutral undertones. I got 25/8 the warm rose color and I love it on my skin tone! It is easily buildable and doesn't mattefy the skin. It's not the longest wearing product ever but that doesn't bother. I will last for over 4 hours, it just might not last for 10 hours. Beautiful color! I bought in store. * I like the formula and delivers a soft pigment that is buildable.  i was hoping Cool It would be ideal…but it is quite peachy. Great for warm tones, but another miss for those of us with fair cool skin tones. * I bought this blush about two years ago and I think it works very well. I find it applies best when I just take my middle and ring finger, rub it on the stick, and then gently stipple it onto the apples of my cheeks. I find that putting spots on my face can sometimes lead to over-application or applying it on areas with which I did not want to apply it. It is a very buildable consistency, if you want something lighter, just apply less, but you can also build up higher pigmentation. The more product that you put on your face, the more of a Dewey shiny look you get. I find this blush works best with a more natural look, as it does seem to wear off throughout the day unless you set it down with translucent powder or another powder blush on top. typically, I will just apply a tinted moisturizer, followed by some concealer and powder and then follow up with this blush. I have not experienced any color difference throughout the day, it seems to stay the same other than the fact that it does wear off slightly. there is no noticeable fragrance and throughout the past two years the product does not seem to have grown any mold or changed how it behaves. I definitely think it's a great product, especially for the price! * One of the best drugstore cream blushes on the market. you can use it before or after setting powder, and it lasts for quite awhile. very pigmented and buildable! * Amaizng color love it but it takes off my foundation or disturbs anything else put on top, would be gtreat for those who dont wear anything under or a summertime look"

62,colourpop,pokÃ©mon x colourpop instant crush cream blush,pimprod2045285,2624663," * I just ordered another Electroball Colourpop Pokémon blush because it is the most perfect flush of believable sheer color. I apply it with a dry sponge that has a rounded but somewhat flat bottom so my fingers dont get stained. This summer I'm all about the hot pink coral lips and cheeks because it imparts a vibrant and lively look to the face and I can keep the eye look simple with just liner, mascara and a neutral eyeshadow from lid to brow or none at all. There used to be a MAC cream color base called Virgin Isle and I love Electroball way more than that. I ordered the violet one this time around and hopefully it'll look just as fabulous. I'm also going to try it as an eyeshadow and see if it makes my brown eyes pop. * My NB son, 15, wanted to do his face (first time) to go to drag show and loves Pokémon. He's a perfect match to the palest Morphe foundation. I was afraid the cherry red Pikachu blush would be too intense, but it imparted the loveliest cherry red flush and I built it up till it was just amazing.  Now I want my own, his cousin teased that she was going to steal all his Pokémon makeup after seeing how beautiful it looked on. * I got the light pink blush. It is so oily and completely sheer. Trying to rub it into the skin is like rubbing lip balm. 

Tower 28 cream blush is so much more pigmented and not oily. I have no idea why all the products from this launch are so bad, but they are. * I got all three and it seems like its a cream to powder matte finish. They are all sheer and very builable.  I would use a smaller blush brush to get color pay off. Very pretty and natural on the skin. * I bought the shade electro ball and its gorgeous! It blends out super easily and the color lasts all day with no issues. It's a great cream blush."

I've never been disappointed in a product from Elf! * Really nice glow, but a little more sheer than I usually use. But it layers really nice! * I think if i warmed this up on my hand first it would work better, but i want stick formula products to work when directly applied to the face. This doesn't work like that. * I would buy this product again * On the go or time on uou hands, this product is so easy to use. It blends easily wherever you need a touch of color. * I love the color but.. it is very grainy and I can put half of the stick on my face and then use a beauty blender and then it would just disappear. I tried this on my lips and it is horrible for the lips USE ONLY FOR BLUSH OR EYE SHADOW PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!! * Whoever says it blends easily must be a wizard because I cant get this to blend without it being so patchy.

It appears the consistency or formula is different. The lighter bronzer shade was a lot cooler, and was a lot easier to blend out. This looks muddy. But the pink highlight is my asbolute favorite. I wish they sold just the highlight shade by itself.. * This palette is great for everyday! It blends great and lasts forever. * This is my favorite face palette!! I'm obsessed with it I've used it for years I always repurchase. The bronzers and blushes blend so nicely, and all the colors go perfect with my skin tone. I will say I'm not super pale and fair skinned though, to me this is more for medium tan girlies * I love this pallet. I have been looking at this for awhile now and wasn't sure which color to order but I'm glad I went with this one. I think the others would have been too dark. The contour is slightly darker but I can easily use one of the lighter bronzers for contouring. * I found this to be too warm to use for bronzers/ contour. looks very orange and yellow. the blush and highlight are okay though. * Beautiful"
65,perricone md,no makeup blush,pimprod2004408,2541775," * This is by far my favorite EVER blush!! I have goofy combo skin and some fine lines-this blush goes on so nicely and it doesn't make my face look more oily in my t zone and it does not settle into drier skin and lines! Absolutely worth the price and I hope they never stop making this blush! * I love this and the color but it used to have spf in it. Now it's just a regular blush. I noticed the brand has been doing away with the products being spf. Which is a shame since that's the reason I stocked up in early spring. Now since it has no spf, I am in no hurry to purchase. I still miss there spf gloss that used to be this color. * I've been using this blush for over a year now and I love this stuff!  I have dry, flaky skin and using powder blush accentuates my dry spots. This blush gives me a beautiful glow with some added moisture.  Long lasting and beautiful! I really think this blush would be good for all skin types especially dryer skin, a little goes a long way! * I love this blush in the summer when I need a bit of a boost on my cheeks for going out after doing some sun loving activities. I have sensitive skin, so when working outdoors I can only have sunscreen. Due to the sunscreen in the blush this helps being able to put some neutral makeup on for work without the risk of my face getting sunburned with regular makeup. I love the neutral color. Perricone MD used to sell an spf lipgloss in this color as well, I wish they brought back the lipgloss as it smelled great and worked fantastically. * CONS 
1. This blush burnt my skin. 
I applied the blush almost daily for several months. 2 weeks ago the skin on my cheek bones where the blush touched (in the exact shape I apply my blush) got a terrible allergic reaction: painful, red, extremely dry and bumpy. It has been several days of using soothing skincare, and the irritation is still there, although very slowly subsiding. 
2. As other reviewershave mentioned, the cap cracks easily when you screw the top closed. 

PROS 
The shade is buildable and starts very subtle. I have light skin, cool undertone, and this blush looked beautiful. * i only used this once or twice. i screwed the cap on too tight one time and the lid breaks and the stopper sank to the bottom. please replace the cheap plastic with metal. * I love the color of this blush and it blends beautifully. Big drawback though is the packaging. The lid completely cracked when I tightened it. I love this blush but now I can't take it anywhere. Please fix this packaging!!!!!"
66,bareminerals,loose mineral blush,pimprod2034497,2599467," * Looking for Warnth blush powder * Bare Minerals products are the a source best! The only product on the market that doesnt break out my face! 100% recommend. * I love it * This is one of my favorite blush formulas! 

Hint is a medium, warm berry that is super shimmery (not glittery). Works for most skin tones. Even if the color doesn't show, it makes for the perfect, skin-like, glowy highlight.

Beauty is the most matte of the 3. It is still a little shimmery and it looks very similar to Hint (just a smidge warmer) without the shimmer on me. It is the most pigmented on the 3 so I think it can work for all skin tones.

Vintage Peach is the most glittery and lightest of the three. I was worried it would be bright orange but it is not, it is a very light peach color. It might be ashy on some skin tones and it is the least friendly for acne and skin texture.

Overall while it is a bit of a hassle to use it is gorgeous, doesn't harm your skin, blendable, and lasts about 8 hours on me. * Have used for years. Won't use anything else * I finally found the perfect blush. I have tried everything - cream, liquid, powder. THIS is by far and wide the best blush I've ever used. For reference, my skin tone is fair with neutral undertones. I have combination skin that leans more toward dry and I'm in my 30s. I bought the Vintage Peach and it literally gives me the PERFECT glow (no exaggeration here). I'm really picky with my makeup because with my skin type it's hard to find stuff that actually works, looks good, and stays working and looking good. This blush is a teensy bit glittery but honestly it's not very noticeable on the skin and it doesn't bother me at all, if anything it really helps give you that nice glow I mentioned. It being a powder, I was concerned at first with my skin type, but honestly it blends in so well it's like it's a part of my skin. I love it. I'm sticking to this, and although the packaging is small (be prepared), a little goes a REALLY long way so I know i'll get my money's worth. * I should have read more into the ""shimmering"" aspect of this product before I bought it. I was happy to find a clean blush with a beautiful color but the sparkles are too much. Will be returning."
67,nyx professional makeup,buttermelt pressed powder blush,pimprod2045333,2624632," * Im going to start of by saying that this blush is so cheep but amazing! Its super pigmented but blends out really nicely and they have a lot of good shades. * This blush is so stunning! The color lasts a very long time and you do not need a lot to get the color you want out of it. With that being said, I have to be ever so delicate with the amount I put on since it is SO pigmented. A little goes a very long way, but its slightly a nuisance. However, I did get a deeper shade since I really like the color, so it could just not be formulated for my skin tone in mind, and that makes complete sense. * This blush is way too pigmented which is normally a good thing but not with this blush. I barely even touch the product and it's extremely pigmented, its hard to fix. It also goes on patchy. * I was skeptical before buying it but I can definitely vouch for it now. It really has a buttery effect and leaves your skin looking radiant. * I like this blush, I want to love it but it's almost too pigmented. * I wasnt sure what to expect with the recommensation of this shade of blush but so glad I purchased. I am a fair-medium olive tone with green eyes and this blush adds thee perfect kiss of flush. It is SUPER pigmented so I barely dust my brush and it has lasted all day. Havent experiended super hot weather yet so I cannot comment on the staying power in heat. * I purchased this blush in March and will check to see if it clogs my pores by summer."

I have a light - medium complexion and think the colors work for me. I don't find it orangey at all. The colors are very pigmented so a little goes a long way. I really like all the shades and nice having a brightener included. I like using it under my eyes. * Not yet used it , but packaged come intact and looks perfect for me olive tan Indian skin. * This is one of my favorite bronzer palettes to use for clients.

I like to cycle through different make up, but this is my absolute favorite go to face trio! Smooth, moisturizing, stays in place, excellent quality! Thank you. * The blush adds such a pop of color to my cheeks! I love the bronzer! It adds warmth to my face. The highlighter is one of the best highlighters ive ever tried!! Would recommend! * I had a great experience with this. Everything glided on smooth and gave me just enough color. The shades worked well for my light skin tone. My only issue was it was expensive for the size. I'd like to be able to get a brush in there and I'm going through it pretty quickly. This will be perfect for an upcoming trip and I know it is someting I can just reach for a know my make up can be done quickly without much thinking. If you haven't tried it, I would. * Love this little trio! For busy mornings this is my go to. It simplifies my routine and is perfect for travel or even touch ups. * I got the pop of petal color scheme, and the bronzer and blush shades are perfect! The bronzer isnt orange and they blend perfectly. Only wish they sold them individually in bigger sizes, because I ran out of bronzer before everything else! * Blush is great too, but the bronzer formula is what's so amazing. It blends so easily and it doesn't get weird in my hairline. I'm 42, dry to normal. My melasma is like reverse contouring so I need bronzer at the temples. Petal pop, colors are A+ * it came with a little peice broken or scrapped off, it shouldn't be a much as it cost maybe lower. overall not the best product but its still decent!"
71,dior,rosy glow blush,pimprod2039824,2612202, * I now get the hype of this blush on. The shade pink really adopt the skin tone you have… This is the pink blush on I am looking for…I think it is similar to milani's luminoso shade…without the shimmer…I just think so * I fell in love with the Lilac Pink color. It looks beautiful with my complexion. The packaging is luxe so it gives me a little joy to see it among the more budget friendly makeup I normally use. The blush has a faint fruity scent which is so delightful when applying but fades quickly so is not bothersome. So initially I 100% fell in love with this blush. But after only a few weeks of use it developed hardpan and I couldn't get any product on my brush. Scraping the blush or using tape to remove the upper layer is helping get to the good product but it quickly hardpans again. I should be able to get through the blush but won't repurchase. For that kind of money I expected much better performance. I don't have this problem with the drugstore blushes I use. * I have the lavender shade & you literally have to dig in the product for any pigment. I use this on days where im trying to look like im wearing no makeup. Definitely not worth the price. * I have the lavender shade & you literally have to dig in the product for any pigment. I use this on days where im trying to look like im wearing no makeup. Definitely not worth the price. * Surprised by the high rating on this particular product. The pink has ZERO pigment. Ill try to use a spray on the compact itself to lift the product but it is absolutely not worth the money. * Very pretty blush. I'm hoping it will look great during the summer when I have more color as I chose the cherry shade which is absolutely gorgeous. * I love this blush! I use it over my YSL liquid blush abd the combo is unreal. Please bring back the lavender shade! It's sooo pretty!

I have very fair skin, and this creates a healthy pink flush rather than advertising fake paint on my face. Love it! * I am not a blush person so it was with caution that I purchased this. I now have 4. To be clear, I like the blush to look like its coming from my actual skin, underneath. I also found the Bobbi Brown blush brush to create this look perfectly while depositing color well. I have had no skin irritation and have early mature dry-combination skin. It stays on all day too. * Dior blush lasts 3 times as long as my Nars blush. The little extra you spend initially is worth it. You won't need a replacement for a long time. It also won't break up on you when it gets low. Nars does that to me almost every time. I love this product. It actually saves you money and the colors are beautiful. Now lets hope they don't get greedy, change the formula and mess it up. * I have the newer formulation in ""Nude Look"", and I love it.  I love how buildable it is.  For no makeup, makeup days it's great because you can make it be more natural looking.  I read a bad review on this page and said it was patchy?  It's not patchy on me at all.  Maybe because of different make-up prep?  I love this blush and definitely would recommend.  Yes, it is pricey, but if you want to splurge on a good blush…. This would be a great option. * I hate blushes that are so pigmented or just don't blend well meaning they aren't natural but this is so cute! Sometimes when I want like a sunburnt look its super natural & when I put it on everyday its super lightweight and it doesnt smudge. People can say it has no pigment but me personally I love it because I swatched their little brush twice and I got enough pigment. * I hate blushes that are so pigmented or just don't blend well meaning they aren't natural but this is so cute!

Smooth, and makes my skin glow with a soft plump. I use this product every day. * This blush is perfect. I have been searching for the perfect shade and this is it. * I have been on the ""match your lips to your cheeks"" trend since before it became popular. I do this by simply using the blush as normal on my cheeks and then dabbing some on the center of my lips for a natural tint. I have never had a problem with this before and, as you can imagine, this is not a new concept to me. I used this blush for the first time yesterday and my cheeks looked like absolute perfection! That is the ONLY reason this is not getting a one star. When I applied it to my lips, I noticed that it burned, which was something that definitely doesn't happen when applied to cheeks. I remembered it was a plumping blush so I put it out of mind. It is 24 hours later and the pain is horrible. I am worried that in some way it has caused a chemical burn (something that isn't new to me as I work in a lab). I'm attaching a picture as of this morning with no makeup for reference. I beg you, PLEASE hear this story when you are considering buying this blush. * I got this as a sample and ended up buying a full size product. I love how this blends for me. It stays throughout the day and doesn't run or rub off. Easy to take off with makeup remover and just overall good feel. I will definitely be purchasing again. * This blush is amazing. You csn keep it sheer or build up the color. It is a beautiful color in pink. I thought i could get a similar product. No nothing compares. 
There is a slight fragrnce to it but nothing too bad. 
Will buy again and again. * Am always looking for subtle, nondrying color as part of my everyday minimum - tinted moisturizer, blush, mascara. This is my new fave. Simple application, subtle color and glow. I'm not sure about the plumping factor but it seems to photograph well. * I REALLY wanted to love this product. the color is beautiful and I was so excited about the plumping feature. Unfortunately this blush is just not pigmented enough. When I blend it it basically completely disappears. When compared to other blushes out there this just does not measure up :/. I'm disappointed but I did a side by side of this blush and another blush on a swatch test and it was CRAZY how this blush basically disappeared while the other one perfectly blended. not worth it sadly."

Omg its such a beautiful color! Im fair, fair-light skin tone, and it looks like blush/bronzer. It looks like beautiful sunburn turning into bronzer. Im planning on buying full size now. Also, i slept w makeup on (life happens lol) and its still on right now. Im really surprised about this blush and its performance. Love this!! * I'm fair and cool toned, looking to find a beige/nude blush that would be harmonious with a more nude color palette of lipstick/makeup. This one is so stunning, and looks so gorgeous. I'm sad to hear Pat McGrath Labs is leaving the Ulta scene, but I'm so glad I was able to find this. * The divine rose is easily one of the most beautoful blushes ive ever used. It applies so smooth and easily buildable. Its flawless! * I absolutely love these blushes!!  My top 2 are Divine Rose and Flirtatious.  These are beautiful everyday shades that work with any eye look that I do.  I love the natural sheen in these blushes, but they arent glittery or emphasize texture.  One of my favs!! * Purchased the shade nude venus and all i can say is wow. So creamy, buttery, pigmented!!! Looks beautiful on the skin. Blends into the skin, doesnt leave any patches or streakes. Truly a really nice blush, its worth every penny! * amazing blush!! has lots of fall out but sits beautifully on the skin and has such a great formula would recommend trying this (: * I have a hard time finding a blush due to being pale and not loving pink on myself, but i love this color and product overall. Never thought I would ever be one to wear blush."

I was looking to lighten my regimen for travel. The color is soft and blendable.  I use on lids, cheeks and lips. Exactly what I was looking for. * It has great pigmentation but doesn't blend well. * Bought this brush based off the good reviews. Very dissapponted. This blush has a weird textire its a but chalky and does not blend in well. Also it does not last and isnt very pigmented. Save your money. * I love the cherry blossom babe shade but the formula disappears within the hour. Its such a shame. * Although I love the color and accompanying brush of this blush stick, I find the texture to be too sticky. 
I am used to a brand that slides on smoothly. Not sure yet if I would buy it again. * I use this daily. I like makeup that doesn't look like makeup. This gives me a dewy, natural looking flush. Dabbing some on with one finger takes a few seconds and it always looks great. I've used it for my mom too."
78,kvd beauty,good apple blush balm duo,pimprod2043903,2621127," * I really wanted to like this blush as I have been on tje lookout for a highly pigmented cream blush. Unfortunately, i was disapointed by the KVD blush balm duo's performance and don't believe it is worth the expensive price point. 

This product is not nearly as blendable as i would typically prefer my cream products to be. It sort of has a cream-to-powder feel due to how quickly the product dries / mattifies during application. I have to really work to get any kind of transition of color because the pigmentation is so strong, and it is incredibly hard to blend with or on top of other products without triggering the following issue; product settling into the pores and accentuates the skins natural texture as opposed to any kind of blurring effect. Incredibly difficult to blend as a result, and despite my best efforts, maybe 75% of the time it creates the appearance of strawberry skin on a previously flawless base due to how the product settles on the face :/ overall, i would not say that this KVD blush balm duo was worth the cost nor could I recommend its formula to anyone who migbt be interested in a blush balm * Ohmygod im gonna BUST. This blush is the best purple blush ever made. * Very pigmented, but also very bendable. Layers well over liquid foundation, or under powder for a less intense look. A bit of a learning curve at first but very worth it imo. * doesn't blend as well as other brands. color pay off is fine for an hour or two and then completely disappears. will not repurchase. * This blush is amazing! Let me start by saying I work 12 hour night shift and some nights I'm very physically active, leaving me with patchy/streaked or zero face makeup at the end of my shift. I live in the South and our air conditioning went out at work on a 93° day. The thermostat read 79° at it's lowest indoor temp that day and after a very sweaty 12 hours of work, this blush was still holding strong! The pigment is pigment-ing (seriously the most color rich blush I've ever used) and a little goes a very long way but it's creamy and still easy to blend out. The balm like consistency is great for dry skin, doesn't settle into creases, lasts forever. Definitely my new favorite blush * Im so happy kvd 💋 I loved its amazing shade and very pigmented stays all day * I was really excited to try these colors since theyre so unique. The red is absolutely stunning, but the purple ends up not being purple once its blended out, and turns more of a fuschia/dark hot pink color. Ive been on the hunt for a purple blush for awhile so i waa bummed to find that this isnt quite it. However, I really love the red as an alternative toned blush. It looks great on my more olive toned skin!"
79,pur,silky tint creamy multitasking stick,pimprod2044097,2620462," * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This was a nice blush. Overall it wasn't my favorite formula- it would occasionally lift my foundation underneath but with patience and a brush application it was nice. * Product goes on smooth but my skin is too tan to see it and I'm not that dark. It completely disappeared on my cheeks. Its not easy to put on your lips if you have a defined cupids bow. * I like this cream stick blush lip color,  it's creamy and a nice natural color and it has staying power.  I like that it does last and last all day long, and it looks very natural.  I also love this as lip color. * This cream blush stick/ lipstick is a great versatile product. It's is a beautiful pink color and it really works well on cheeks or lips. The only issue is that it can be a little greasy and heavy on the cheeks, but it's a great product to carry that works in different applications. * The whole line is sadly so drying * I never recived my product I reached out at least 4 times after the 15 days after shipped never got a reply this is the 2nd product i haven't gotten i have asked my task time is running out what do I do and I dont want to get in trouble for not writing anything  this looks like it would have been a nice product and looked really pretty as a highlighter unfortunately I wasn't able to try it. * I rated this highlighter a 3 out of 5. I will definitely continue to use because I've been wanting to switch to more of a liquid highlighter versus powder. A little goes a long way with this product and I like the glowy shimmer of the finished look. Only thing is I feel like I didn't really notice the glow/shimmer much when I tried to capture a picture of the finished look (hence no picture of the finished look). I like that this could also be a lipstick but again, a little goes a long way on the lips. Can definitely be paired with lip liner and lip gloss. I would purchase this product again."
80,bareminerals,complexion rescue liquid blonzer blush + bronzer,pimprod2044820,2623836," * Tired of old dry looking skin? This will perk you right up. Received a sample and loved it way more than expected.  Just a little drop goes a long way to add a dewy pop of color. I've also added it to foundation that was too light. Spreads on nice with warm fingertips or a brush. Kiss of mauve is a pinkish peach (more pink) with a hint of bronze. Container feels very light but the sample tube did last for quite a while. I'd buy it again. * Hate the tube. Needs to be a stick. It's a lot darker than the powder so you only need like a spec on each cheek. * I purchased this product for my mom who is in her 90's. She is a makeup diva. She absolutely loves it in the color ( kiss of mauve) . It's the perfect shade for her and easy to apply. It gives her just enough natural color. * I'm not a very advanced makeup user but I got a sample of this and I've enjoyed it so much that I'm definitely going to purchase a full size. I can apply it after I've applied my skin tint and concealer around my eyes and it just works beautifully to bronze and contour just enough to give me some life. I love that I can use my fingers to apply it and it just blends away perfectly. * I have really sensitive skin, but this doesnt irritate it at all! It goes on flawlessly, stays all day even without setting spray, and lasts forever bc a little goes a long way! I have auburn hair and pale complexion, so I recommend using the Kiss of Mauve if some of the other colors are too brassy! * This blush is just spectacular! It goes on so well. I can put it on & go or put it on with my full face of makeup & it just looks beautiful. You can even have already put on your setting piwder & it still goes on with ease & no clumping just glides on perdectly. This is my new favorite blush. It gives you just an amazing beautiful color that looks so natural. I LOVE it!!! Buy it! * I love all the complexion rescue products, after my dermatologist recommended it! I apply it with a brush and blend away for a beautiful glowing complexion"

82,hourglass,ambient lighting palette,pimprod2020448,2572721," * The most underrated pallete. I never want to be without it. Subtle glow without the nasty shimmer of most highlights or finishing powders. The color on the right is a perfect natural brozer if you're fair enough. Absolutely beautiful! * I was so excited for this but maybe my expectations were too high. For the price I expected this to apply nicely but its very powdery and didn't give me the shimmer or glow that I was hoping for. The packaging is pretty and feels like it's very high quality and the shades look beautiful but the product itself fell short when it came to application. * I wasn't sure if I even wanted to spend the money on this, since it's very expensive in my opinion for what it is. The reviews here weren't really convincing me either because they seem pretty low. This adds such a beautiful finishing touch! Just a beautiful natural glow, very different from my highlighters! I am thrilled I took a chance and purchased it. * I'm fair and prefer subtle color, so this is perfect for me. I use the first shade over my T-zone, middle shade as my highlight, and the last shade as a light bronzer. I love that the shimmer in it is so finely milled it doesn't look like glitter, just a natural glow * I blend all 3 together to provide a natural dewy glow. Love the effects. And can use individually as well. * Goes on beautifully and stays put in my humid weather here in florida.  Love the 3 highlight colors. * Ive used this  since 2016 and i dont think it will ever leave my daily makeup bag. It makes my skin look smooth, glowy and natural. Its talc free so it doesn't settle into fine lines. Im fair so i use the colors individually to set, highlight and bronze. Theyre also beautiful as eyeshadow. Because they're baked, they also last forever. With daily use, i hit pan every year or so."

Stays on even if you dont use a powder. Perfectly buildable pigment. Definitely a favorite I have 4 shades. Omg AND 3 years before expiration! * This lshows the desired color without having to ""build"" it. I've tried 2 different brands of liquid blush from Ulta that just didn't show color even though out of container they appeared similar shade as what I bought in this product. I like this. I recommend & will purchase again. * Love this shade! Perfect if youre a winter.
Super easy to blend. * Prefer powdered * This product is the best stick blush/balm i have ever seen. * Hands down an amazing blush.

Warm pink is my fave and perfect color. Blends out perfectly!! Definitely recommend. * Pricey but give a pretty and natural finish! * Was not expecting the bottle to be cheaply made plastic. The formula is beautiful but the plastic bottle threw me off. * I have light-medium skintone with yellow/olive undertones. Skin is combo but on the drier side.

It only takes one swipe to get the intensity I desire. * taking a star off because I think I got a bad batch of the new matinee color. I'm so sad because i love the color and formula. It just smells expired. Its only been out since January and I purchased in March and also received in March. Not sure what happened. Maybe they produced a bunch of these early on to send people pr and i got an old one. but im going to try to get a new one and see if its better. Color is beautiful on. I love pink blush and lips * Not only is the color gorgeous but the formula and component makes it so easy to use on both lips and cheeks. Blends into cheeks like a dream and is very buildable. * As my skin is maturing, I thought to change from powder blushes to cream. This was my first try, and it did a bang up job. I have already tried 2 of the 5 gorgeous pigmented colors that I bought during the Ulta sale, and they have not disappointed. They blend out perfectly with a brush, and stay all day without oxidation. I have tried them over both cream foundation and powder foundation with the same results. I have also tried them over highlighter which adds an ethereal glow."

Definitely will be buying in other colors as well. * The blush is very pretty but the contour part came smushed and once i turned the tube to bring product down it completely fell off the tube. Not my favorite for my first time trying this product * I have fallen in love with this duo! I got Grapefruit/Caramel and the colors are amazing! Super creamy and easily blends. The case is cute and works great and the product lasts a long time even with daily use! * Love this hybrid gel cheek duo * I purchased the Grapefruit and Caramel color. I tried it out with my fingers and a brush.

The good;
-Pretty colors. They swatch mat but do blend out sheer and become part of the skin. 
-Elegant formulation with a creamy and light feel on the skin. 
-Easy to use, compact and portable.
-No discernable scent. 
-Neither the bronzer nor the blush have any glowy particles. 

The not so good;
-I am fair but cool toned and ALL the colors are warm on me. Why Stila, why? 
-Once applied the blush and bronzer become sheer and the colors disappear as they blend in. 
-I had to do multiple layers before I could truly see any color payoff.
I am tempted to purchase a darker color combination just so it would show up. 

Overall this is a clever, very convenient, and  portable product. Perhaps great for on the go touchups. But it is so sheer and blends out on my skin so much that there is virtually nothing left."
87,morphe,huephoric rush 3-in-1 silk blush,pimprod2045434,2625274," * I absolutely Love this blush and purchased the initial 4 colors they started with as soon as I saw them as the swirl looked so interesting. I've not been disappointed and will be buying the 2 newest shades. These are creamy and go on smoothly. They are highly pigmented and you can build your color as desired. They blend well and with my fair skin I used the darker shades to create those shadows where I want them. As I am more mature, 65 y/o,  than many writing reviews, I do tend to have some larger pores bur have not found this to be clogging in any way and while it stays on beautifully throughout the day I don't find it difficult to remove at night with my double wash. Run, don't walk, to add this to your makeup bag! * As lovely as the shades are, the very first item on the ingredient list, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, is highly comedogenic (pore clogging). It can also cause breakouts. I can't get myself to apply this on my cheeks and nose which is exactly where my pores are. * Made my foundation separate. Ive tried warming it up on my hand. Covering my brush with it on a pallete. Tried fluffy brush and dense brush. It all caused separation. I think my skin just prefers liquid blushes. Easier to blend out. * I got the shade pleasured which is the warm pink. Its a bit sheer but its a really cute color. You can build up the pigment and it looks very dewy on the skin. * The first item on the ingredient list is Ethylhexyl Palmitate which is highly comedogenic. Its probably what also makes this blush so emollient and easy to blend. The shades are lovely too. Just unfortunate. * This blush does not move! Super pigmented and lasts foreverrrrr. Seriously like bury me in this blush i will be forever rosy. I work 10 hour days and it soesnt move. I love it.

It applies evenly & has high pigment that actually lasts. I'm tan so finding a blush in this shade range that actually shows up and stays is hard to come by!! I lucked out and got it for a pretty reasonable price, however, I've already purchased 2 additional shades lol. This formula is A1! * Needed new blush after Clinique discontinued my all time favorite which was the cheek Pop, I am not a blush girl at all, I use a fluffy brush and this goes on beautifully set with spray and out the door… with eye shadow and lipstick low key minimal look… love it! 
I have super sensitive skin and this has no talc! Yay! * I was so glad that Bobbi Brown removed the lanolin from their blushes, but disappointed to see that they now contain coconut oil, which is pore clogging.  I know Bobbi Brown has dry skin, and I feel like all her products are made with dry skinned people in mind, but do not work well for people with oily or acne prone skin.  It's too bad, because I have had back luck with several of her products (her tinted moisturizer contains petrolatum, and clogged my pores).  Please make products that anyone can use! * I bought Desert Pink. It is a darker medium pink. The size was small and packaging seemed cheap. Would be good in a makeup kit because it's small, no bulk, and has a window to show color. It's buildable but the price is too much for what you get. When you pay this much for blush you expect a bit more. Pretty but the size and price are cons for me."

I'm  a medium brown skinned, 50 year old . These colors compliment me both ways * This is my 2nd time purchasing this palette & it's everything.  I especially like to blend the gold bronze and the pink bronze together. I use the morphe fan brush to apply and the rose colored highlighter brush to blend and it blends the highlighter and bronzer perfectly. Since I moved this product isn't sold in store so I had to order...that's the only thing that I don't like is that it's not sold in MN Ulta stores. * This palette is exactly what I was looking for, the colors are very pigmented, but it is a little hard to blend out well. The colors are fantastic; it has contour, blush, highlighter. Also, I use them as eye shadow. * This palette is horrible! The contour and highlighter do not blend easily at all. The highlighter has very chunky glitter. If I could give it no stars I would. * The blushes in this palette are soo pretty. The bronzers are warm and beautiful as well. Perfect for your kit. * This product is goood!!! I'm an MUA... and it's good for women of color * I have been looking for a bronzer for my deep complexion and wanted to try out a few shades before committing. This palette lets me do that. Both bronzers work nicely for me so I blend both. The contour is super pigmented so go in with a light hand. The matte blush shade is super pretty and I love the highlighters. Haven't tried the brightening powder yet. Would purchase again once I hit pan."

Very pigmented and gives a pretty glow to my skin! * This is by far my favorite blush and I have used lots of more expensive ones. It is a gorgeous color (I love Goldie chassis) and gives a slight shimmer/glow to the cheeks. I have several colors. The price is amazing as well! * actual formula is really nice, but it's way too shimmery for me. there wasn't a lot of pigment either, which is something that I am personally looking for. but if you want something shimmery with a slight pink tint, the shimmer itself is very pretty. * I lover this blush. This is the second color I've purchased. I'm normally a liquid blush girl but this adds a pretty shine and glow. I could see it being a little too glittery for some people. * Texture, color and price.....PERFECT! * This blush is perfection. Great pigment, goes on smoothly and has a little glow to it, luv ut!"
91,nars,blush,pimprod2044741,2621262," * I've been using the original NARS orgasm color for years, and it's always been my favorite. Finally ran out of my stockpile and had to buy one of these new formula ones. It's nice they're talc-free but the color is much lighter, less pigmented, and the actual formula has changed and feels more powdery to me. Not a fan, very sad, hope they can improve on this new formula ASAP. * I love the color.  Has the perfect sheen to as well.  It's the perfect shade of peachy pink.  It goes on smooth.  Last's a long time.  Will buy it again. * Im so dissatisfied with the new formulation. Not even close to the color payoff the OG blush had. * Nars use to carry my all time favorite blushes, Orgasm and Sin. Now they carry my least favorite blushes. Sin has been discontinued and havent found a replacement yet. The reformulation has no pigment. Its really bad. Orgasm may as well of been discontinued. Its not like the original. Doesnt show up. And im very fair. I can't believe someone approved this. Especially with such a cult classic shade. Idk whats up with Nars lately. Possible dupes are YSL-Make Me Blush, shade 93 for Orgasm and LH Cosmetics- Duo Dimension, shade Area for Sin. But hey, at least the new packaging is nice. You can pop the pans out. I just wouldnt want to anymore. * I was trying to buy the original shade of Nars Orgasm blush and ended up with one that is much lighter.  I wish they would have tagged the OG. * I've been using this blush for years and it truly is the best! * I have been using the Orgasm shade for several years. I tried the shade #237 and I was pleasantly surprised that it was a bit darker than my fave but it looked really nice and seems to last all day."
92,anastasia beverly hills,"face palette - all in one bronzer, highlight, blush",pimprod2024358,2576830," * I bought this for traveling and was pleasantly surprised.  The bronzer is way more pigmented than expected-a little goes a long way.  Blush too but the overall end color is fab.  Highly recommend for a medium skin tone! * It's really hard to find warm leaning products that aren't too deep, but I found Italian summer is super flattering on my complexion. If you lean cool, this palette might not be the right one for you as it's very gold-based in person, more so than the online pictures. I dropped one star because there is glitter in the blush+highlighter. It blends in pretty well but would prefer more of a natural shimmer. Overall a great three in one palette for a minimalist like me. * Although my skin tone is on the lighter side, I opted for the Costa Rica palette because I preferred the blush color. The bronzer is thankfully not too dark for me and blends nicely. I'm not a fan of the highlighter color, though. It's way too bronzed. I have the ABH highlighter palette so I just use that, but I was trying to find an all-in-one face palette. I likely won't repurchase, but it is an ok palette if you like all the colors. * I love this palette. I have pale skin, so I bought Italian summer. Great pigments and great packaging. * You need this it's truly REMARKABLE ITS SO NICE MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR COLOR THOU.This will get you many to ask what you're wearing and where you get it.  The inside and out it's truly worth all the coins. I just hope it last so I'm able to get a medium one too. This is my go to and will be for a long time. Loving this. * The blush and bronzer are pretty, but the highlight is so powdery, it has not shine at all. Thinking about returning. * It's beyond a different shade in person then here. Beyond disappointed since most store aren't taking exchanges :("

A little goes a long way and it lasts all day. It comes in great colors and is my favorite of all the blushes I've tried. * I loveee * This blush applies easily, blends well, looks beautiful, and is within my price range. The packaging is lovely and it fits in my purse. It's fab! * First off, I really love this formula. It's highly pigmented and blends easily into the skin. However, the packaging has some issues. There is a lot of product buildup around the rim that I have to wipe off with a tissue every second or third time I use this blush. It's just disappointing to lose that much product especially since I really like it. * Great liquid blush. Love the bottle and applicator. Nice color and blends well. I just have to remind myself to go easy because a little goes a long way * very pigmented and comes in many pretty shades. the packaging is super cute, it looks like a rose! the applicator is unique and easy to use. would definitely buy again!"

It's such a unique formula. The powder is not patchy or too dry, so once it sits on the skin, it blends beautifully and looks like real skin. My skin tone is fair neutral (think Elf Soft Glow shade 13) and the Velvet Crush color is my perfect match. I hope they make this product forever because I just love it! * Long wearing * I don't know if it was mis-labeled or what, but it's way darker than I wanted. I wanted something light and shimmery.

I always run out of time so anything that is quick and looks great on is a game changer for me. * I love it ! Blends easily and great for travel. * I loved the way the color looked on my skin.  I did not break out from this blush. * I ordered this small size to try and I love it! I have finally found a blush that I love and looks perfect on me. When I am done with this mini, I will order the larger, regular size compact. Sometimes I like to take my brush and get all 3 colors on it and use it like that and it gives a pretty glow to the look. It stays put all day and I recommend it! 5 stars! ⭐️ * I absolutely adore this product and it's versatility. It's my go-to travel blush. I pair it with Rare Beauty 'Hope' liquid blush or wear it on its own.  I love that it has three shades to create a custom look on my cheeks, but when I need to move fast, I use all of them all at once for a pretty soft glow blush.  I view its small size as a complete bonus.  It's absolutely perfect. * I love this color! I had been wearing the color mocha from Chanel for years and years and out of nowhere they discontinued it and nobody knew why because it was such a unique color then I switched to our oasis also discontinued so I found this and I feel like it's very similar I'm just wondering if it's going to stay on and where as well as the other two did! I really hope this doesn't get discontinued. I'm gonna buy a few more and I wish it came in a larger size. I do not feel like the her eyeshadows wewr well even w primer so im crossing my fingers that the blush stays on better! * As a ND collector this one was a miss for me, although the mini pallet in this series was great. This pulled really orange on my fair cool pink undertone. I also found the size of it impractical for having 2 blushes and a highlighter in it. I knew it was mini and that wasn't the issue, I just think it could/should have been JUST blush and it would have been great. But that highlight mixed in wasn't it for me."
97,nudestix,nudescreen blush tint spf 30,pimprod2043960,2620585," * This appears nice and natural, and counters potential risk of removing standard sun protection while applying blush. 
I appreciate how the application technique(s) this promotes appear(s) to support alpha hygeine. * I have both Sunny Sweet cheeks a muted warm pink and Strawberry Sunburst a warm red. I prefer these over the Ciele Liquid SPF50 blushes for everyday. The finish reminds me of the Original Benefit Benetint with the translucent wash of color that still allows you to see the skin underneath. Love that they have broad spectrum sun protection since the cheekbone area is exposed to a lot of sun and prone to hyperpigmentation. In the pic Sunny sweet cheeks is the top blush shade and strawberry sunburst is the 4th. Ciele Kirsten and Elodie are 2nd and 3rd from the top. * So i bought this blush when  it first came ouy and fell in love with it, all of a sudden it gave the worst and most painful  allergic reaction, has this happened to anyone else? * I love this is an spf blush!

Sometimes I struggle with dry skin due to acne treatment so makeup can look a bit patchy, but the formula for this product is amazing! They are buttery and apply smoothly. I am barely starting to run out so I will definitely be buying again. Highly recommend for any makeup beginners looking for a reliable, safe option * I used this pallete for my wedding day makeup, it looked so good! I love this palette so much i just repurchased it and it's my go to for so many looks! * This is the best powder formula in the world! It definitely deserves all money I paid! Strongly recommended * In details it boasts that the mineral wear line is talc free, but the first ingredient listed : TALC! 🙄🥴🤥 * For me, this is perfect!! I love the blush and highlighter for my complexion. I am an olive complexion with yellow undertones, and struggle to find the right ""shade"" for my skin tone. For me, this is perfect! I am very happy with this purchase and the value I paid. * I love this! I tried the hourglass palettes (dragon and evil eye) but the formula looked too shiny and strange on my combination skin and the colors were off for me/needed to be built up too much. I got this instead and I like it so much more. Its not too warm, just right. Im extremely fussy about blush shades and this is the perfect pink. I dont have to build up the color at all like you have to with the dragon palette. It just looks good on the first go. My makeup is taking less time in the morning since everything is in one palette. Use a light hand with the highlighter as its very shiny/pigmented. * if you are a beginner in makeup, this would be perfect for you, the options r amazing and you can really experiment"
99,polite society,polite pops powder blush stick,pimprod2044285,2620617," * Its a nice product but not worth the price! For the price i would go with other high end products. Its easy to carry with you but you do have to re apply often, too often in my opinion for a blush. * I have the shade Los Angeles which is a stunning bubblegum pink (my favorite). I tried to use my blush brush directly and it wouldnt pick up any product. So you have to use your fingers, possibly a sponge. But it feels so dry and powdery, not at all creamy. This makes it very hard to blend over makeup. For the price, the formula is not worth it. Cool packaging though * I am regular to oily skin combo and have added this on top of powders and foundations and it looks so natrual withoit disturbing my base makeup. I am cool toned and colors pull orange on me but the color Sydney looks so natrual. I bought two other blushes i have never tried and havent even opened them because this one just goes on so effortlessly and looks just as good at the end of my day. Also, this is the fourth review I have done on my life, that is how much I love this product. I am 41 so its great for maturing skin. * I love the concept, but for me these are kind of hard to work with and do think there's a learning curve. I tried these with and without a base and was not impressed. Without makeup, it immediately sunk into my pores. With makeup, it completely lifted everything under it. I'm still playing around with them as it could've been the the other products rather than this, but I have my doubts. In my opinion, they are overhyped. I got them on sale, thankfully, and won't return as I am adamant about trying to figure them out, but I most likely would not repurchase. * I  would not purchase this brand again.  I've had several others that are creamier and go on much easier than PS.  Also, I do not think that it lasts as long as others. * This is just the right size, I love the packaging. Colors blend beautifully just as described. Highly recommended and will be traveling with me this summer. * So simple to apply and blend with fingers. I use malibu to give a healthy subtle glow to my cheeks. Would purchase again!"

My only objection would be how expensive it is and the color i bought was slightly different than online. (I bought velvet petal) * Ordered the lightest color cotton candy in hopes it would be a very soft and light pink blush color, but the color  in reality was way darker and more bold and nothing of a baby pink color. Still it is a pretty blush color and I will use it, but I was rather disappointed in the difference of color. This was not what I wanted to have and therefore I will withdrew 2 stars. * I have used Jane Iredale products for years.  I wish Ulta carried more of their products. * Jane Iredale powder products are the best! I have oily, textured skin with baby hairs, and this blend flawslessly and lasts all day! I've only tested the matte blushes, I owe several colors and would buy more if Ulta carried more shades! * I love the color and texture. It goes on smooth and lasts all day without irritation. * So beautiful and sheer. Just the right amount deposited and I don't have to blend much. Gorgeous colors. I got two and I think I'm going to buy a third one. * Love this blush. Most blushes are too bright on my fair skin and even with a light touch, I feel like I have to blend it forever.

Product is very pigmented and the whole pallet lasted me a whole year!! This is my second purchase! Id like to point out i never miss a day without makeup so i personally think you are getting your moneys worth and the highlighter will have you poppin and you will be that girl.

Just bought a second one incase they run out * I'm obsessed with this palette so much I'm sad it's stars arebt higher. lol It gives you that perfect I spent all day at the beach look. * I have been on a quest to replace my 4 year old cheek palette from Tarte, and this ain't it. The colors don't apply evenly and there is way too much glitter in the blush and highlighter. I returned it and will continue to scrape the pans of my old palette until i find a suitable replacement. * The blush is show stopping. I get stopped all the time when i wear it. So confused why the reviews are bad bc this palette is gorgeous. the highlighter is pretty, and the bronzer is quite pigmented. Nothing too special- the blush is def a game changer tho. * I really wanted a cheek palette to cut down on clutter in my makeup bag. I was sorely disappointed to learn this wasn't it. The highlighter is just glitter. Way too coarse of a glitter than I prefer for a highlight. It looks nice as a shadow. The blush is more of a highlight, it's very iridescent. I learned that I prefer matte blush after using this. The bronzer warmed up my light complexion nicely but it does not make a good contour color; I use it more for a sun kissed glow. There is a lot of fall out from this palette.  It is usable but not as I intended it."

This was hard to blend and made my cheeks look patchy. * I have the shade meet me there, it is the perfect mauve and the formula is so buildable, has easily become my favorite!!! * I love this blush!!! Its not quite a cream but not powdery either. Blends super easily and is buildable, which I like. No harsh lines just beautiful rosy cheeks * I love blush its my favorite makeup to use. I have super oily skin and after a few hours my makeup will slide off. This blush will stay all day and is gorgeous on the skin. It lies down perfectly, won't settle into my massive pores or fine lines. Just adds a beautiful flush. Just an fyi im pale and oily so im not sure how it works on melanated skin but worth a try * Never thought I'd buy a product from an ""influencer"", but this product is just what I wanted.

Too orange, especially the eyeshadow. * I love a good all-in-one face palette for my makeup on the go bag. This drugstore version had what I need. However, the bronzer is a little too yellow for my fair skintone, the shadows are pinky (personally, I would love a more neutral trio that I van use for day-to-night), and I would trade the shimmery blush for a contour shade or a matte highlighter shade. My opinions are based on the fact that I use this for an everyday palette on-the-go and not for a certain look. * I use this daily and does not break me out!! * I really like this product. I like using a cream blush underneath and then one of these on top to set it. You can't beat the price and the quality is very good. * I wish they would make more all-in-one palettes like this. It is good quality, and flattering shades. Please make more! * The bronzer made me look orange and the eyeshadow falls off of my face, same with the sparkles from the sparkly blush but the highlighter is amazing and the blush is very pigmented. * I thought this would be a fairly large sized face palette, but its tiny! Its like a mini face palette. This is what makes it great for travel, which is how I'll probably use it. 

The eyeshadow colors are flattering peachy-pink-terracotta shades, very pretty for summer. The texture is lovely and easy to blend. The slightly larger blush, highlight and bronzer are good quality and fairly pigmented as well."

I'm tired of always having my shade range available online only. Beautiful palette, bold colors, and deep enough for the darkest skin tones. 

I just hate the fact that I have to wait days in order to get my shade most of the time. In addition to me having to purchase multiple shades in order to find my exact one.

Fantastic every time! * Very expensive, but worth the money. I will use this in the summer because if it's tint. I love how it is a tint  because it will tint and give me a natural look without coming off in water. * the color stains well and is nice but it agressively chaps your lips. after using my lips, especially in the corners, turn red, chapped, and bumpy. my friends have this issue as well, so I dont think I am allergic. be mindful when using. * It's ok on the cheeks. It's messy to put on and can stain your fingers. On the lips it's awful. I've tried everything with this- one coat- layering and it only sticks to certain areas. Doesn't last. It also has a strong rose flavor on the lips which is off-putting. I wanted a lip stain and this isn't it. It's ok for the cheeks. * The smell is yuck. I don't know where they get that is lasting 8 hours from. This is gone in an hour with maybe some staining around the rim of your lips. Do not recommend. It'd be pretty if it actually stayed and wasn't toxic smell * I absolutely love mixing this with the high beam for my cheeks, especially during the summer. I liked the color on my lips, but it dries them out so terribly that I won't do that again. * I had this product 15 years ago when it first came out.

108,charlotte tilbury,lip & cheek glow,pimprod2043349,2619522," * I like this product. It applies nicely and leaves a bit of a glow. It also feels nice on the lips unlike many other multi use products. Wear time is similar to most cream blushes.  However, I don't think the Colour or Dreams is the most flattering shade for lighter skin tones. It's a deep brownish rose and probably best suited to medium to tan skin tones. It's a nice texture and feels hydrating but there needs to be more soft shades. I have less expensive cream blushes that offer just as much with a better shade range. Pretty packaging though! Since we are going into Winter I will keep it but I prefer a more brightening shade. Maybe something a little more pink. * Cream blush easily blends over foundation powder or liquid. The deeper rose shade is good for summer into fall. * I bought the red blush because it's trending, and it is so perfect. I brush it across my cheeks and over my nose for a sunburned effect, it's gorgeous. I had never used cream blush before. It's actually not that messy or inconvenient, and it doesn't feel greasy. Easy to get used to. * I was disappointed that that the color was more brown than pink. Also that it was very light in pigment. I needed to apply several layers before I saw any blush on my cheeks. 
My friend also bought this product but in a different shade. She had the opposite effect. Her tint, which was a bright pink, deposited too much color. * Product works well on my skin. Product does what it advertises to do * I have just recently started using cream blushes. The one in my current rotation is Rare Beauty's Vulnerable Melting Blush. I like it, however, it began pulling my foundation underneath. I also wanted a bit more pigment. I decided to go with Charlotte Tilbury's Lip and Cheek Glow. Oh my goodness it is so pretty. Every time I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I see how glowy this blush is. It looks even better with a highlighter. I am pretty fair, so I chose the shade Pillow Talk Colour of Dreams. This is exactly the shade I was looking for. The right amount of pigment to where I don't look bare or look like a clown. This is now my go-to blush for a no makeup-makeup look or full glam. * I've tried many cream/liquid blushes and this made it to holy grail. Usually terracotta works best for me but this is unique.  I think soft brick may be close.  It's more neutral than it looks. 
Blends easily with brush or sponge. Apply and look like a goddess."

Will definitely rebuy!! * Loved the product but the color palette ended up not working for me. * I was worried the cream consistency wouldnt last long on my combo skin… though I hydrate it well. But it is really great!! This palette last long especially if you prep and set it right! The colors are skin like. So its somehow natural looking while being so glowy and glamorous!! The glitter looks pretty big in the cream. But once on the skin it's gorgeous. Perfect ratio of glowy and shimmery! Nooot greasy of oily! * I loved my Nars O-gasm 🎨 to death; I wish it were permanent. This Iconic London Cream palette 🎨 is the next best thing - the closest cream 🎨 I've found at Ulta - to the Nars. I waited until I had a ton of points and a 20% off prestige coupon to purchase. I paid about $20 out of pocket for it. Now that I've used it a bunch I would/will pay full price if necessary. I'm 46, light complexion w/combo skin. These creams are very nice, pigmented and blend beautifully. I 'set' using the Nars Crystal Powder, then top areas w/desired powder products. I 'spot set'- chin, lower forehead, top half of cheeks and lightly on the nose. (Dior Forever Skin Glow foundation 1W).. Its great to take on the go/traveling. Nice packing - good bang for your buck 👍🏼. * Although the Iconic London Brush, Bronze & HL palette is kinda close- its still nowhere near my Nars Or*gasm cream face palette (limited edition). However, I love this palette for it's own reasons, which I listed above. * I would get this if you are scared of very pigmented blushes the contours are nice and creamy but not the blushes and the blushes have glitter. The highlight is nice and creamy as well. * All creams to use for cheeks eyelids and wherever i want a glow or highlight. Purchased on the half off sale . will use for travel . Its nice"

The eyeshadow isn't really a usuable on its own. Pigmentation is pretty poor all across the board. * I have been loving the oh so nudie stack to do my makeup on the go. The top is a buildable shimmery eyeshadow, the second layer works as a bronzer/blush combo on my fair skin, the lip balm adds a faint swipe of color, and the highlighter is nice. * So I got the Oh so Nudie stack on sale one day and gave it a shot even though I'm not a morphe fan. This killed it. The eyeshadow is especially good and super flashy and looks really pigmented when applied correctly. The blush is flattering for my tanner skin tone it's like the perfect blush and bronzer mix. But my fav is the face highlight balm, it's the best highlight ever. It's so flattering and real looking. No powder glitter or pigments that look good in one angle and terrible in the other. This is just a clear balm that doesn't rub in and disappear like others I have tried like this. It looks really good on their hint hint skin tint which I'm loving as well and use every day since it is the perfect oil free which is a must yet glowy foundation tint. Morphe2 is definitely doing it for me which is nice to find out because now that I see these other stacks I kind of need them... * I love the stacking idea but I'm can't decide if I love the product or not. I have the ""Violet Vibes"" version. The top layer is a very light pink eyeshadow with sparkles. it feels a bit chalky but it's alright. The second is a sparkly blush, again, a bit chalky and I don't love that it's sparkly but it's alright. The third layer is a berry colored lip product with a slightly sticky chapstick type consistency, which is nice but difficult and messy to apply without an applicator. The final one is almost like a glitter balm with chunky glitters. Definitely a bit of an oddball choice but can be fun on certain occasions. I would probably recommend this to a friend but the bottom two are a bit inconvenient and I do wish the powders were more buttery and high-quality feeling. * Wanted to love this. It's compact for travel, that's about all the props I can give it. It's cheaply made and should be sold as makeup for little girls to play in. Not impressed at all. Will be returning it ."

However, it is very smooth and blendable, and as long as you use a light hand it is looks beautiful. * Very pigmented, but you can control how much is applied. Looks so soft and smooth, pretty on my mature skin (57). Not a dry looking matte. I want more colors! * it looks so patchy!!! * Great * This is a great dugstore blush. Very pigmented but it's also a buildable coverage. You can create a natural flush with this blush, without appearing too heavy or patchy; OR, you can build it up for a dramatic look.

So happy!!!! * I bought the nude tude shade and unfortantely for me i do not love it. The product is fast drying and when first applied looks very pigmented. But no matter what products I use with it or set with it this stuff DISAPPEARS. I really wanted this to be my ""blonzer"" shade but its just not worth the $$$ to me. * I like this blush you need very little and it blends easily * I've repurchased the shade Nude 'Tude twice now since this launched. Its not that you need a lot of product, its just that I use it pretty frequently. Its a neutral shade that just looks so natural on my skin, goes with any and all makeup looks. I bought two other shades as well, and they are nice but very bright and don't get used as much. 

The formula of this is a whipped mousse-like texture that is matte and blurring. It dries semi-quickly, so apply one cheek at a time, but don't stress about it setting too fast. I don't find it difficult to work with, nor is it patchy. * I found these shades to be far too pigmented and matte for my fair skin. They aren't easily blendable and dry down super quick.

It was scatched on the upper blush stick and the package was not in it's original condition. Since it was on sale i didn't return it, but who's doing the shipping controls? I like the blush, but that makes me upset that the package is done so carelessly. * Was a great purchase. * These blushes are amazing. I use these with or without a base and it blends out beautifully. I haven't had any issues with pilling or patchiness. I have several colors and am always looking out for the limited edition colors. These may have a learning curve depending on the other makeup being used, but I'd recommend trying to apply with a brush rather than direct contact and remember to pat not swipe! * For reference, I bought the cream blush along with the cream bronzer and comparing the two formulas, the blush is more like oily and slick like. I dont know if its because my blush came a little melted or thats just the formula. It could also be quality control because I see that in reviews from this brand in other products. Overall, I like the product. I didn't experience any patchiness or color fading. It's better to tap this product in than smear it. I have combination/oily acne prone, textured, skin and it lasted on my skin without any problems. * I am an advid makeup collector and have MANY cream blushes in my collection. These are definitely some of my absolute favorites! I own teddy, bubble gum and Jam and they are all beautiful but jam and teddy are something else! Out of all the blushes i own im always reaching for those 2 specifically. I have fair to light skin and teddy is the absolute best neutral everyday blush that goes with every make up look. Jam is also fabulous. It looks like a natural berry flush on the cheeks. Super blendable and creamy and i love how most of them have a matching powder blush to set with * Love, love this blush! So pigmented and melts easily * Perfect tones, pigmentation is there and you could never overdo it, blends like a dream, easily buildable, smooth application"

The shade nude buff did not work for my light to medium neutral undertone. It barely showed and disappeared. I own other shades and just realized that swiping it directly is not the best and it can drag the skin.  It can also be the formula since this is the matte version. * Love the color and it blends out so easily! * I purchased in nude buff. The first thing i noticed was its off putting smell. If looking for a subtle blush this was not it. Did not blend well. I will say building the blush for a more dramatic looked allowed for better blending. Unsure this was the right color for my medium skin with olive/ yellow undertones. Did look nice on lips. * Nice compact stick, simple application and blend. Genius. * Goes on smooth and creamy.

I warned the clerk returning it not to unleash the glitter. * I love the feel, color and staying power * I'm a registered nurse who has worked in dermatology for years, for that reason Jane Iredale has always been my ""holy grail"" because of the high quality product and packing. This another disappointment in recent years with changing once elegant classy formulas and packaging to cheap glitter makeup with flimsy packaging. I was hopeful the color mist would be a replacement for my beloved in touch cream blush in clarity but no way!!! This reminds me of something I would see in my 3 year old daughters play makeup kit. The glitter in this is beyond overwhelming and actually makes skin look drier. Please bring back in touch cream blush . I think it might be time to move on and find a new makeup brand for my needs. * Disappointed, too much gliter and doesn't blend well. * I got Glorious and am relatively fair, and I love it. It doesn't last super long, but it's easy to re-apply. I like to put it on even when I don't have other makeup on (like when I just woke up or go for a walk or whatever) for just a natural slightly flushed look.

But if you want more vibrant and just smoth blushes then maybe save uour money and buy a better pallatte but if your trying yo save a coin and just want multiple blushes that arent bad then go ahead * Pros:
Great variety of blush shades, all in wearable colors.
Great for fair to medium skin tones (neutral/olive/warm undertones mostly)

Cons:
The wear time is average.
This palette def wont work for deep/deepest skin tones.
May not be flattering on cool tone skin. * Affordable and beautiful * love love love the dofferent shades of colors, plus very essy to apply * Really love this blush set! I am a fair skin woman so I am not sure if it would be as pigmented for my darker complexion pals but if you are fair skin it works well. Blushes are blendable and enjoy that I am able to switch my blush around each day. * If your lookihg for a budget friendly blush palette this one is the one you should get!

It was super peachy with a lot of glitter and it didn't work for me. But Oh Baby pink is accurate and it will be a staple for me for the long run! * I absolutely LOVE this blush! As someone with pretty oily skin, especially on my cheeks, this is one of the only blushes that I find wears well on me and stays put throughout the day. It never goes on patchy, and is pigmented but not too pigmented.

Everytime it patches up. * I cannot get enough of this blush. it's so easy to use and incredibly buildable. using just a little (in the more natural shades) gives you the most realistic wash of color. absolutely beautiful. * I purchased three of these blushes (Big O, Shagged, and Score) because I was, sadly, influenced. The colors are lovely, but the texture of these is horrible. They seem creamy in the pan but feel chalky on the skin. They're very patchy. And they don't play well on bare skin or with other products. These were a huge disappointment. * I purchased this blush in the shade 'Shagged' in store after testing it on my hand and felt it complemented my medium skin tone well. I've used it a little over 10 times, and have noticed that it patches up a bit when applied. * It is not easy to blend at all. Looks like some patches on my face * The color does not last long on my face. It's like it absorbs in my face.

Pat it on. It looks so amazing * These are gorgeous! I picked up 2 during the sale but will be getting the rest of them. These are a very thin, creamy, glowy sheer blushes that make highlighter unnecessary. No detectable glitter just the most beautiful sheen that brings your cheeks back to life! This formula does not dry down however, they do become less sticky but doesn't dry down completely.  Therefore, I would not consider these long wearing but that isn't in the claims either. As someone with dry skin, these are stunning and everything I want, and doesn't emphasize texture. I heard these are a dupe for the makeup by Mario plumping cheek blushes and I can totally see that being the case but I do not own those. * Such a creamy blush with good pigment.

But it doesn't last that long tbh. I wear it to school but at the end of the day some of it is gone. I would still recommend because the shimmer is really cute and I haven't found a blush that is cuter than this for everyday wear. It would be perfect if it lasted longer tho. I see everyone say the blush leaves them patchy, but that is most likely because they have facial hair. I shave my facial hair and it is no longer patchy after I shave it. * I do love the color. However, the longevity of this blush sucks. It doesn't last half a work day. I catch myself reapplying mutiple times a day to keep the color i want. * Really soft and truly works both on cheeks and lips. * Love this product. Goes on smooth. Looks and feels natural.

I have aging, combo-oily skin and these stay ALL day. I use a smaller, less dense brush to stipple on my cheeks/temples/nose and it's perfection. I wish more people talked about this product because it deserves it! * This product is very lightweight and sheer which is perfect for summer months where you don't want a full face of makeup. Also the colors are nice (bought peach and cherry).

However, it instantly dries once it hits your face so you need to QUICK so that you aren't left with a streak of unblended color. Its hard to blend out and working to get it to blend moves any makeup that was underneath before application. It also looks patchy on the skin due to difficulty blending. * I've been eyeing this product for a while and decided to try Cherry as an affordable option to the red blush trend. This is STUNNING. Definitely best blended with your fingers right after application before it sets. Dewy and natural and effortless! * I bought this blush as a dupe for the you know what, and i ended up really enjoying this in my routine. The shade is very pretty and it feels so nice and cooling on your skin. Its just a little to blend. * This is a really pretty stain for lips and cheeks! I love the different shades. The price point is decent. I'd say this is a milk dupe but I think undone came out with this first! * OMG I love this blush! It's so buildable and it feels cool on your skin. It's a natural flush that you can keep subtle or really make it pop. * its like the tarte blush sticks but way better. they actually dry down and don't leave a greasy feel at all. ive had so many compliments its unreal. definitely more pigmented than a lot of other blush sticks/stains (looking at you benetint). excellent price for a great product"

I have used this as a regular blush, which gives a soft glow all over the cheeks and as as highlighter over different blush. if using as a highlighter, it does have a pink under tone, so I had to blend it a little with the blush I did use and it looked so good still! this was my first iconic London item I've ever tried, and I'm now obsessed and am going to have to try more products from them! * Love how it looks on my skin. * Easy to blend and a good shade that works well on medium skintones without feeling heavy or overly saturated * Love the tanny glow on my fair skin.

I tried it multiple times, multiple different ways and each time i had to remove it with makeup wipes and then just use my rare beauty blush. I wanted to love it, but unfortunately it was bad and a waste of money. Beautiful color though. * I bought this with the laura mercier tinted moisturizer because i assumed it would mix well and last with the same brand. I was wrong.

I wanted to love it, but unfortunately it was bad and a waste of money. Beautiful color though. * I got the shade Province as a GWP. I am super impressed with this. I am quite fair (shade 110 Haus Labs) and this is a wonderful shade for a natural blush that looks great on neutral-warm undertones. Going to purchase. * It's a lovely color, but it does not blend well at. It dries very quickly and won't blend out once dried. The color is very light and when I tried to add more to build it up, but it just wiped away what was there along with my foundation. While it doesn't work well as a bush I found it works very well as an eyeshadow. I really liked the color so I tried it as an eyeshadow and it looks really nice. It also stays on very well. So if you find it's not the blush for you try it as an eyeshadow. * I'm surprised at the negative reviews. I love the consistency of this product - it's thinner than a cream but thicker than water. I just use my fingers to gently dab on my cheeks. It blends well and looks natural. I do layer it on top of my foundation - maybe if you're dabbing your whole face and then blending it might dry and be difficult to blend out, but I haven't had any issues the way I use it. The color is not thick so it looks very natural. This is my favorite new blush. * I loved the color but sadly I had to return it because it was patchy. No matter if it was on bare skin or with skin tint"

I have to say I am impressed with how smooth they glide on and how buildable the colour is. They have become part of my everyday makeup routine and I am totally in love with the colour payoff. * I actually got this as a gift for my mom as I've heard really good things about Nudestix blushes. She really loved it and says its easy to use and creamy * If you want to create a look in less than 5 mins this is the easiest kit you'll ever use! You have your blush, bronze and glow all in one kit making it super easy and fast to use. The shades are very creamy and are easy to blend with your fingers. * Everyone needs this kit! It is the perfect size for on-the-go and has a blush, bronze and glow color to use to create an easy and effortless look. * Hydrating pigmented good performance great size i specially love the bronzer * As i have gotten older my skin needs creams instead of powder. I sae these for such a good price and i got them. I love them they blend so nice and creamy. Its a perfect size too so they dont dry out and i can use them fully. * You can easily build up the products depending on what kind of look you're going for, and they blend so smoothly onto skin with fingertips or a sponge! I use this after prepping skin with DIME tinted sunscreen. The highlight blends best with fingertips as it is a little dark, so warm fingers disperse the glow a little better! This is a wonderful set for someone getting into more natural & simple glowwy makeup :)"

I am very very fair, so not much product is needed, but I'm definitely going to keep ""Bubble"" on hand all the time. * Cute Barbie pink blush. You can go light or intense with these and I appreciate that. A little highlighter with these are perfection * I absolutely adore this blush. Saw reviews where they said it has no lasting power but mine will literally last a full 12 to 14 hours. The only downside I've noticed is that it can be a bit hard to blend. * Easy application. Smooth finish. Love this. The color Bubble on my cool fair skin is perfect. Usually even blushed labeled cool/neutral still afloat orange-y on me but this one is lovely. * I am a blush lover and I just found my favorite blush! This blush is simply beautiful, easy to blend, buildable, and long lasting. If you're thinking about it, buy it! You won't be disappointed. * Beautifully pigmented and buttery smooth application.  You cannot go wrong with this blush.  It blends, it builds, it hits the mark the first stroke."

Hard to apply. Color doesn't look the same on face. * Matches perfect with my skin and hair color * Stays on all day matches perfect with my skin and hair color * In Barbados.... Perfect shade to go with all the mochas trending out there * If you are looking for a super or even decently pigmented blush, this is not the one. If you are looking for a shiny blush and is barely noticeable then this is the one. For reference, my skin tone is similar to mocha and when I used this blush, in the shade Belize, I didnt get much pigment. However, I did get the shine."

Natural looking color.0 * Such a fun makeup to use! the jelly delivers a punch! super pigmented. I love the flushed color for the summer sun burnt blush look. Excited to try some other colors. * I seen a review with somone as the same complexion as me, it looked nice on her. The pigment was actually there! But when i had tride it myself its like the gel was disappearing as i rubbed it in. Im disappointed at the fact it didn't work for me, even with layering. Plus the actual product is TINY! * This product gives a natural flush to the cheeks. It does dry down fast, so you have to work with the product quickly. My complaint is the size of the product. It's pricey for the amount you actually get. The tube is small and it's not even filled all the way with product. * Love it 😍 * I am so glad I found this after a long time gel blush product from another company was discontinued. This is a tint that is buildable and it looks like naturally flushed cheeks, which is exactly what I was looking for!"

I also love the packaging, and the way it's shaped like a rose! I highly recommend this blush! * i use a brush to apply this product but even then it does not appear to be as noticeable compared to my other blush products (powder, liquid). very pretty design, though, so makes for a cute gift for someone. using a brush does not ruin the rose either.

when i finally do get some pigment, the color is beautiful. i got this blush in the color 'crown'. but it is just not worth the hassle to work it in. * I almost didn't buy this because there's no way this works, right? Like it's so pretty, it's just the aesthetic, form and not function, etc. NOPE. I got the color Crown and it is not nearly as red as it looks in photos, more of a rosy brown. It's the perfect all natural flush (I have light/medium skin with golden undertones). I've used it about a dozen times or more and the rose still maintains it's shape (I use an angled brush). It's also just so pretty that I reach for it over my other blushes now. * Had problems with other bushes and when I found this, I loved it. It's creamy and doesn't need a whole lot to pop. 🩷🩷🩷 * Winky Lux had a luxe line, LAQA, for a number of years and i LOVED their cream highlighters/blush in Preacher's Daughter (coral) and Rose Royce (light rose/pink.) When they ended the line i bought as many as i could. 

So now im out of the Rose Royce and haven't found a dupe. I was really hoping this would be it, but it's rock hard, difficult to apply and cheaply made. Yes, the rose is fun to look at, but it's not an effective product in any way. So disappointed. * I am really unhappy with this blush. It's patchy and doesn't last at all. It looks cute. * I've had 3 of these in different shades and it dissappears within 30 seconds of applying it like literally evaporates. so weird."

Highly recommend. * I love this  so mich it gives a good tuch up to my makeuo * I liked this liquid blush for the price. I found that it wasn't very pigmented, a stripe from one cheek to the other gave me the color I wanted. Also left my face feeling a little sticky/oily. Good for the price though! * Love this product! Found through TikTok on a drug store makeup routine and I'm obsessed! * I love this blush sm. You only need a tiny tiny bit bc it's so pigmented and tbh it's easy to put on too much. This is perfect (savage coral) for a bright pink/peach shade. It's not too cool toned but not too orange-y either and blends super easily but doesn't smudge/mix with foundation. Great price & pigment, & long-lasting:) * Very beautiful blush. Probably not the best youll find but definitely not the worst. * This is the perfect liquid blush consistency it doesn't smear or move its glowy and its buildable perferct under powders or by itself."

151,flower beauty,lip and cheek gel crush,pimprod2018369,2597110," * This is a great blush if you have dry skin and are going for a minimal makeup look. They are not super pigmented. You get a sheer wash of color and lots of glow. This is my every day blush, but not my special occasion / full glam blush. It does not dry down completely, but I wouldn't call it sticky. It gives a very dewy finish. * I have both coconut crush and blackberry crush. I bought the berry one first and love it so much I thought I'd try the coconut color.

I apply this blush using a brush and tap it in. You can make it as light/subtle as you want. It has a nice dewy finish which I love since I have dry skin. It doesn't remove foundation underneath.

As a lip color, the staying power isn't that good, but it's a nice color and shine. More like a balm.

To compare the colors I have, the berry is more pink/purple whereas the coconut is more red/orange. They are the same depth though. I have fair neutral skin so I can go between a deep winter and a deep autumn depending on the color scheme I  use. * Gives a flushed, healthy glow rather than looking like you applied blush.  On my minimal makeup days the glow I get from it is priceless.  I have fair skin and the raspberry was perfect for me.   I have moved towards cream blushes in the past few years and this is my favorite. * Meh. The color is pretty but it doesn't wear well. The strawberry shade is a bit light, even for my fair/light complexion. The color blends well enough but it sort of sits on top of the skin and slides around. It does not stay in place, if that makes sense. I keep re-trying it because I want to love it but it just isn't a great gel/cream blush option for me. * Its easy to build on (I do three swipes on each cheek), easy to blend with a brush, great pigment. My current favorite blush. * Literally NO pigment and made my base cake/oxidize immediately. It was like rubbing a grease stick on my skin. Even on it's own as a dewy look, still does not show up. Also not brown and black friendly in the slightest due to the drop of pigment added. I have a medium olive tone and I used the most vibrant shade, it  did not show up. Don't waste your money, Get Pixi for that price! * Its not pigment the most but its creamy and really blendable. I really like it"

It is literally one of the most amazing powdered blushes I've ever used. It has such a nice light powdery strawberry smell. Yes, the strawberries at the top wipe off, but the color underneath makes up for it. It also comes with a built-in brush and a mirror. I could not recommend a more perfect product. * I loveeeeeeeeeee the color!!!!!!!!! I do wish the strawberries stayed but what do you expect? * I use this every day in my makeup routine, and its never failed me before!! * One of my favorite blushes that I've used! I love the smell and the light pink color is so pretty!! The only problem I have is that the pan runs out very quickly, I've only had this blush about 2 1/2 months and it's already empty! * The cutest blush ever and affordable! Smells like strawberries and its such a nice pink pigmented color. The strawberries do come off after use but other than that highly recommend. * I always get comments about it!

I love love love 160 berry smooch. its the same color as Tarte Natural Beauty and i love that in from the cold flush. it gives snow white cheeks. The color is a red with cool pink undertone and it looks so healthy and natural. I love this as it gives a watercolored effect, its longwearing and smoothing without falling into pores. I will forever repurchase this as it is my fav drugstore blush * I absolutely loved this product. It was a good shade. One I would have picked would work for me, so I was pleasantly surprised with that. Will be adding this to my routine. I love that I get to test free products. * Love the glow of this blush you can use it as blush and highlighter. Gives a nice glow to the skin. The pigmentation is also great it was packed nicely and there is no scent that bothered my skin. * This Milani cheek kiss liquid blush + glow in dolce pink gives me a healthy glow to my cheeks and face.  It brights up my face instantly.  With just this blush and some lip gloss i am ready to go out.  The dot application is so easy to apply and it is blend able depending how pink you want your face to look.  I really like this liquid blush and will use it as often as i can. * If you love a natural sheer blush that melts into your skin this blush is the one to have! I love the glowing finish it gives me.

The cream highlight and powder highlight pair beautifully together. I love the color of the blush when swatched but I will say i was expecting more if a creamy texture, it feels more like a powder to me. Cant wait to try and would definitley recommend either way! * Love this palette so much. Probably one if my all time favorites as it works so well with my skin tone. Will buy again over and over! * The cream textures are really unique and superb formulas. The blush blends like a dream and the highlighter is unbelievable. It blends so easily with just a few taps from my finger. I cannot say enough about these two. Love. The powder highlighter is pretty and I do like it, but when you pair it with the two creams, it really isn't anything special. I wish it had been another cream. Another highlighter color or blush color in the cream formula would have been amazing. That's why I have 4 stars and not 5. Still fully worth the price tag for the two products though. * I'm not sure why the reviews are so great for this pallette. first of all, it arrived broken and second I'm pretty fair to medium skin and I have to put several coats of this on and it's hardly noticeable. In my opinion, definitely not worth the price. Highly disappointed. * I love this palette! The blush is agreat color and the cream highlighter is my favorite highlighter of all time. I use the powder highlighter as more of a highlight eyeshadow. I only wish the blush was a cream formula like the middle highlighter. * This texture is stunning. These formulas glide beautifully, no streakiness, perfect tones, and the texture is stunning. Believe the hype. Natasha's makeup is QUALITY. Worth every dime! * The interplay between color and texture in this palette is genius. I cant remember yhr kast time i felt so oretty, as i did when i wore this.

This stick helps give the illusion of a much smoother undereye. I cant see myself ever buying a different color correcter. Its so smooth. It makes a huge difference without being noticeable * Color perk may be a little too orange for my medium skin with olive/yellow undertones. But a little goes a long way and evens out dark circles with the help a dab of foundation on top! * Glides on nicely blended well, full in moisture. * Im 43 and have dark circles, puffiness, and fine lines under my eyes. This product is a great color corrector. It's creamy, blends great and doesn't cake up. I now use this daily. * This was amazing for eyeshadow, contour, and lips!  it's not creamy enough for me to use it as a blush but the formula and pencil shape works so beautifully for precise shading & detail work around the eyes, lips, and nose with a perfect natural finish. And I used the shades Grounded and True for a gorgeous eyeshadow look.  I will definitely repurchase. * I wish I had read all the review before I purchased online. TRUE is not true to color.

Also it takes like 6 months of use to run out! Great blending and pigment stays all day :) * I have tanner skin and I have a hard time finding blush that shows up on my skin but this blush is pigmented enough for me! I love coral blush on my skin so I got the shade amber/fuschia. amber is soooo pretty and fuschia is really nice too. it is a little difficult to blend, so I would suggest starting with a little and building it up. * I love this product so much, it's lightweight, blends easily, and the best part is that it doesn't remove my makeup when i use it.

I have to say this shade is so beautiful and absolutely perfect for fall. It is sheer at first but you can build it up for the right amount of color. I cannot comment on how it fares as a lip tint yet but even if you only use it as a blush I think it is worth the buy. * The lip stain lasts minimal 3 hours and the tone is perfect! * I got the shade Blush.

Give me some matte or satin finish then I'll repurchase. * I was excited to receive this blush because the color seemed beautiful ""golden coral"" but it doesn't have that much details on the product and when I received it it looked like a super shimmery highlighter. Not what I wanted, it would've been so beautiful without the glitter/shimmer * I am 42 and I can't wear makeup the same as when I was younger.

I put a little on the back of my hand, smear it around a little, then tap a synthetic brush into it and apply it to my cheeks.

After I tried it I applied more because even though I extremely fair toned it did not show up at all and disappeared. I'm disappointed to say the least."

The blushes don't really show up. The bronzer is nicer as eyeshadow also bc it hardly shows. Way below normal colorpop quality and was not worth full price. * I bought this product in store because it looked cute, I love the highlighter  because it is so pigmented and it goes on easily.  the clasp broke the first time I oped it, so I won't buy this again. * I've been on the hunt for a bronzer/blush/highlighter palette that is small enough to take on the go, so I was really excited about this. The TLDR of this is that I enjoy the bronzer and two blushes, but hate the highlighter.

The blushes and bronzer are all matte formulas, and then the highlighter is the Super Shock putty-cream like formula. Personally, I never liked the Super Shock formula because I prefer using brushes when doing my makeup, and none of my brushes can pick up this formula, leaving me to do it with my fingers. Okay, whatever. I can get over that. But the biggest problem that I have with this highlighter is that it is mostly GLITTER. I love a glitter highlighter now and then, but not when using an everyday palette for an everyday look. It looks so weird to have matte bronzer and blush, and then a stripe of glitter on my cheekbones. It would be fine if the highlighter was a cute shimmery color, like Lunch Money, but it's very glittery which sucks. Tbh, I bought a cheap Essence highlighter so that I could crush up the ColourPop one and transfer the Essence one into the compact so that I can actually have an all in one palette. Oh well.

However, the packaging is a bit of a miss too. Aesthetically, it looks great, but mine no longer clasps shut even though I haven't done anything like drop it. So it's probably not a great option for traveling anymore, which was why I wanted it… lol * I love this blush. It has the perfect combination of bronzer, blush shades, and highlighter.

Everytime I have purchased this product the container falls apart so easily. It fails to protect the powder causing it to eventually crumble apart. I continue to purchase it because I absolutley love it but I wish colourpop would read all their reviews regarding the poor container packaging and create something more durable so that the powder will not shatter. * One of my go to palletes, especially for the blush!!

It looks like it would be way too light and not have any pigment, but is so dang pretty and radiant with just the right amount of pink flush. * When I first opened this blush I thought it would be to light but I am happy to say I was wrong. it is a soft flattering shade with a slight glowing shimmer.

It smells amazing and it goes on smoothly. * I was skeptical about this palette cause this is from the Original makers of TOOFACED. I can't wear much of the TooFaced products. I recall buying the original palette in 2010. I know that long ago and those were good. I decided to buy it on a whim, and omga. I NEVER RETURNED it. I shockingly love it. I'm OILY and it stayed on the entire night. I fell asleep with it on and it DID NOT BUDGE. STAYED COMPLETELY THE SAME. If you're an oily  girl you NEED this palette. This formula is top notch. Cannot wait for them to make more colors. And yes, if you're dry or normal to dry, it is going to be harsh on your skin and if you don't moisturize your face well you cannot blend it. However, I absolutely had NO trouble blending. It is not a secret technique that I'm using on my face. HYDRATE and use an oil with your face cream if you need to. * Beautiful shades of peach and highlighter. Goes on smooth and never blotchy. Hope they add different colors in the future…this is a keeper for sure!! * The shades included are pretty but the pigment and blendability is lackluster. It might be worth it to buy it on sale. I am going to return this item and use my Mac blushes instead. * The powders aren't bad, but the Highlighter breaks so easily that I haven't received one not broken yet, so I can't recommend this since it's just constantly broken."

I was under the impression that the highlighter and blush wouldn't have specks of glitter in them because the reviews said it wasn't sparkly but it most definitely is. It does give a nice glow but the sparkles are visible to the eye. They're both nice and will be used, I just feel mislead because I thought it would give a nice sheen without glitter and I was wrong. * I received this today in the mail, and already have applied it to go about my day today.  It has a great consistency, beautiful color, and stays on well. I never knew about this brand and just ordered this on a whim. So glad that I did! The only thing that could be improved has nothing to do with the blush itself, but rather there should have been a nice brush included with it. * I'm a cool toned and very fair and bought the rose duo.  Perfect shades for my skin- they blend seamlessly and are very natural looking.  Not too sparkly or clown like bright.  The shades look sort of dark in the picture but are not dark or heavy at all. * Love it's easy application , did  highlight my cheeks subtly, love the shade * Nice combination of blush and highlighter.

I think it would be better for those with slightly darker skintones or for those who may be on stage performing and want their makeup to be a bit bolder. * Nice color and pretty much I like the texture I would say is a god texture to use on summer most of the times 
The color pink is super nice I really like to have that color in y collection 
I think is a nice product for a nice price. I would recommend this blush * I really liked this blush. I received this product free in exchange for my review. The Berry Beautiful color works really well for light/medium skin tones. I loved the quality. It's very pigmented. You don't have to waste product because a little goes a long way and it applies easily with a brush. I think it's worth the investment. It also lasts throughout the day even without a setting spray. * I truly love trying out Pur skin perfecting powder blushing act matte blush. It one of the best blushes I have ever used . It so smooth on my skin . Makes my skin look so beautiful. And color is so gorgeous not to strong but buildable color . Love it . * This looked quite intimidating in the pan but it gives a nice flush of berry on the cheeks. If you're pale like me I'd use a lighter hand, but I think this shade will work on lots of skin tones. The scent reminds me a bit of Tarte powder products. I like the sleek minimal packaging as well. As far as formula goes it's nice and smooth, the area where I apply this blush always has a youthful look so maybe the extra skincare ingredients actually do something lol. * This looked quite intimidating in the pan but it gives a nice flush of berry on the cheeks.

182,flower beauty,ultralight liquid blush,pimprod2043495,2617300," * I wanted to try this product as this color was highly recommended but it was so disappointing. I should've looked into the reviews more because as soon as I started to squeeze out the product a yellow oil began to come out. Regardless of how much pigment came out of the product, the yellow oil always remained. I am too scared to even try this on my skin. * Honestly a little disappointed in this formula as i love the OG cloud paints. I wanted the cloud paints in a more punchy color with a wand applicator. This are not them. The liquid is very thin amd while it blended well, mine dried down (as much as it will) patchy. * I won this blush in a free giveaway and I've never tried flower beauty before, but I was blown away. I have mine in the shade poppy and it makes for the most beautiful sunburnt shade. It's pigmented, but still buildable and easy to work with. I love how dewy it looks on the skin as well. This is definitely a new fav. * I love the blush and it's consistency. I was a little scare about the liquid formula seperating my makeup but that didn't happen. It's nice for me since I love less pigmented products * I think the poor reviews on this product were expecting a dupe (even though its not marketed as one). It says ultralight snd thats whst it is, irs perfect for summer (not full glam, not on foundation). Toasty is the perfect blush/bronzer combo. * I really like this blush! you barely need to put product on your face to have a lot of pigment, so I know this thing is gonna last forever. you do need to blend kinda quickly, and I recommend using a liquid blush brush. I only wear tinted moisturizer, not foundation, so idk how it would work with that, but it does just fine with moisturizer. This is an affordable, lovely blush! * I got the shade cheeky and it has a bit more warmth than i expected for a 'blue pink', but it's a super pretty color anyways! it has the perfect medium amount of pigment and was super easy to blend out with a pretty finish. Wore well too"
183,revolution beauty,vintage lace blush palette,pimprod2007465,2547121," * I have fair neutral skin so I'm always on the lookout for cool toned blushes. The purple on the right looked absolutely gorgeous to me and was the reason I bought the palette, but its somehow orange on my skin. The first pink is nice though, but my search for a cool-toned berry blush continues. 

Also I think the color goes on a bit blotchy compared to other similarly priced powder blushes. * Great smooth blush and great colors. Value well worth the price * Multi use I like to use the orange for extra bronzing. I love the pink shade and all of the iridescent sparkle. * I purchased this for my 13 year old niece. She is medium toned skin with long straight dark hair. This looked lovely on her. She really liked it! * I found the pigments patchy and hard to blend. Also not really sure what skin tone this palette is for... I'm very fair and the lightest color is still way too light. I actually can use it as a highlighter. The medium two do work for me as blush but honestly on the skin they look the same. And then I though the darkest one would be pretty if I could sheer it out, but since it's so patchy I end up having to use a lot and then it's just way to dark. I think it would be better if they made different palettes for different skin tones. O, and if you're buying this for the glitter, don't. It's only on top. * This palette is stunning! Beautiful, BEAUTIFUL, shimmering colors, and very affordable! * I love glue and sparkling things. I'm crazy about this set because it has the colors I like with the touch of glitter that I love.

184,laura mercier,roseglow highlighting powder,pimprod2026325,2584989," * I like anything of Laura Mercier's. Quality products. You will not be disappointed. * A photo doesn't always portray a color accurately or how it will actually look like on your face. Looking at the photo the pallet appears soft pink. It is actually more brown on the skin and like a bronzer. Perhaps trying to make it lighter will help. * This leaves the most unflattering tone on my skin. Not universal and leaves a grey-ash cast. I don't like this AT ALL. Also leaves texture. * Love this LM highlighter I use for an everyday simple look I use my cc cream and LM Chai blush and some mascara to complement my look 🥰 * I was certain I'd love this and ordered it sight unseen. Well, ...

Pros: It has a lovely sheen, noticeable but not metallic or Ofra-y, with zero glitter.

Cons: It's not at all the pale pink you see in the picture, and I'm really not sure what the brand means by ""self-adjusting to match all skin tones."" The color is truer to the product's name; it's a definite, discernible rose. My skin is light to light-medium, not fair by any means, and there's no way this could be a highlighter on me. (Thing is, I don't think it's rich enough to work on deep skin. And it seems too cool to be right for tan skin.) Anyway, on me it's a blush/blush topper for sure.

I can't complain about the formula, and I'm sure I'll use it - but if I'd been able to swatch it first I probably wouldn't have bought it. * I had high hopes for this highlighter but was disappointed when, what I expected to be a pale neutral pink shade was actually a midtoned champagne that's too dark and warm for my very fair, cool toned skin.  

Since this isn't available at any store near me, I bought it based on the photo showing a pale pink swatch, the description of a neutral undertone and the self adjusting shade claim, none of which is accurate.  I could tell just by swatching that it wouldn't work but I applied it anyway and saw that it definitely was too dark and warm.  Since I only wore it for a few minutes, I can't speak to the formula or wear time other than to say it's pigmented with a glitter free buildable shine.  

With the level of technology available, there's no excuse for product photos to be so inaccurate, a problem that also adds to the already excessive amount of wasted makeup.  I love many Laura Mercier products but this was a fail and while I think the shade could work on light to tan skintones, it's too dark for fair and possibly too ashy on deep."

It wears well for more than 8 hours for me. The packaging is sturdy and i love the innovation, it isnt more plastic pretending it will get recycled or that you'll be able to get refills (no one ever makes refills easy to get). I'll try more from this brand. * I love this blush, but the package for me has been the biggest bust. I love the concept I get the idea, works really well and looks pretty, but the packaging breaks apart and quite literally is paper. If this was refillable with still a recycled plastic case that you could recycle again, would love it but the paper case is why I might not repurchase. (Didnt even talc was #1 ingrident :/ ) * I loved the look of this blush, the packaging, contrasting colors, the purple color. It didn't disappoint! It's highly pigmented and lasts the whole day. While the color is deep eggplant in the pan it does run a bit more fushia, not a deal breaker though, still purple. The swatches are accurate! * I never thought a brown blush would be for me. I am usually a peach girly but i have been using magic brownie for almost a year. I appreciate that the packaging is sustainable. Mine has been beat up a but after some time but it has not fallen apart or torn in anyway."
186,ere perez,beetroot cheek & lip tint,pimprod2029283,2588787," * I liked the idea of a clean lip stain and was excited when I read the reviews. This product did not work for me as it was watery when I applied it, not staying on my lips and staining my front teeth. Disappointed as it was quite costly. * I've been looking for a lightweight but vibrant lip tint that wouldn't come off, and I finally found it. Most lipsticks don't last long on me, so I have fo constantly reapply. With this one, it stays in place for a long time. I usually apply a little bit of tinted lip oil on top, and it's perfect. I will be waiting for more shades! * I appreciated this cheek and lip stain for how pigmented and long lasting it was on both my cheeks and lips. I put it on in the morning and was out in the sun all day and it was still very present on my skin and lips when I got home several hours later. 

The stain is very easy to use on lips, but more difficult to use on cheeks. Having largely used cream blushes, it took several uses to get adapted to the lack of blend-ability for this product. I also need to find another applicator to try to use, as I usually use my fingers to blend out products and as an applicator, but this product stained them. 

I do really appreciate the high quality of both the packaging and the product itself, as well as the mission of the brand Ere Perez and this product as a whole. * I used the Beetroot Cheek and Lip tint primarily as a lip tint. WOW did it last!! Initially when applied to the lips it gives a very vibrant coral pink and red hue that is a little too overwhelming for my taste but when I wiped the lip tint off with a towel and pursed my lips together moving the lip tint around it was a beautiful shade that was perfect for summer.
A Tip- the tint is extremely long lasting (By long lasting I mean almost all day with eating and drinking), with that being said it is also somewhat staining. Precisely apply because I found out if I got it out of where it should be applied, it did not easily wipe off and the stain was still there along with my lipstick for a lot of the day. Also be careful on what the lip tint gets on (fingers, clothes, porous countertops, etc) as it is difficult to get off.
This review was collected as part of a promotion. * The Ere Perez beetroot cheek and lip tinted came in the color Joy. Joy is a bright cherry red color that has a bit of an orange tint to the color. The applicator is strong and not flimsy. When applying it on my lips it went on smooth and covered a good portion of my lips with one swipe. As the product is a tint multiple layers were needed to cover the area and have a build up to be an even layer. The product is light weight and because of that it feels as if you aren't wearing anything on your lips. The color is bright and very pigmented and because of that I choose to not try it on my cheeks. I tried it out after eating and learned that it does not fade evenly. My lips did feel hydrated and unlike other tints didn't have a dry feeling. The finish is a bit glossy rather than a matte color. * As someone new to the world of tints, I was so excited to try this. I was curious to see how it would compare to traditional blushes and lipsticks. 

Starting with thr basics, the packaging: it is sleek and minimalist, which I appreciate. The compact size makes it easy to carry in my purse, perfect for on-the-go touch-ups.
Applying the tint was straightforward, even for a beginner like me. The product glides smoothly onto both cheeks and lips. I found that using my fingers to blend the tint gave me the best results, providing a natural, flushed look. The color is buildable, so you can go for a subtle hint of color or a more dramatic pop, depending on your preference. It left mr with a vibrant, rosy hue that looks very natural on my skin. I got shade ""joy"" which i was worried would be too bright and clownish on me. But it turned out to be a versatile shade that I think would complement a variety of skin tones. The texture is lightweight and not sticky, which I loved. It feels comfortable on the skin and doesn't dry out my lips, a common issue I've had with other lip products.
I was also quite impressed with the staying power. It lasted several hours on both my cheeks and lips without the need for reapplication. Even after a meal, the color on my lips faded gracefully, leaving a nice stain rather than completely disappearing.

Overall, I am thrilled with this product! As my first foray into tints, it has set the bar high. The ease of use, natural finish, and impressive longevity make it a fantastic addition to my makeup routine. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile, high-quality tint that enhances natural beauty. * I used this Ere Perez Beetroot Cheek and Lip Tint in the red color and thought it was a very nice color payoff! I've not previously used a product like this so it was my first experience. The product was very liquidy and had very strong, red coloring. I would definitely recommend to start small with application and add more as needed especially on the cheeks as this was just a lot of color at once. I applied dots on my face and lips then blended them out with my finger. My finger was very stained red but I was able to blend it out well on my cheeks and lips best with my finger. I don't really like wearing red on my lips or face but this gave me a nice flushed appearance and looked very natural. I love that this product uses a lot of natural ingredients and it is really buildable if you want more rich coloring on your lips or face! I think you have to remember that it is not a lipstick or lip gloss and adjust your expectations and usage with this in mind! It does what it's supposed to do! Was certainly a nice product and my first of its kind I've tried! Definitely worth a try!"
187,iconic london,sheer blush natural cream blusher,pimprod2015251,2563077," * I see some people claiming they're light and Rose Riot doesn't show up on them, but I'm pretty pale (my range is typically NC15-NC20) and it's one of the prettiest pale skin friendly shades I've ever tried. I either use my fingers or elf's putty blush brush, maybe people are using a sponge which could sheer it out too much. * I love the product hate how it comes out! * This blush disappeared on my skin, even though I am very light.  I tried to build it up, but couldn't get color payoff.  I've been much happier with liquid blush from the drugstore.  You might have better results with a darker shade than Rose Riot. * I purchased the shade cheeky coral. I have light to medium skin and it does not show up on my skin at all. It breaks apart on my skin then disappears. Ive tried using a sponge, brush, putting it directly on my cheeks, putting it on the back of my hand and no luck :( the color is beautiful though! Does anyone have any tips and tricks on how to get this product to show up and stay on the skin? * Had rhis on my favorites page for a year and extremely disappointed. First use, way too much product came out that i had to waste. Does not blend well, have to use an additonal blush to blend into face. * Perfect finish, can use it alone or layer with a powder blush. It doesn't move my base products around and it doesn't exaggerate my poor skin texture. Ive used multiple brushes to see if it would change the look or finish, but it always blends seamlessly. Highly recommend * I'm not much for make up, so switching to a liquid blush was intimidating but it's pretty easy to use!  You can layer up on how much you want the color to pop, and it stays on an oily face like mine ALL DAY.  I get compliments every time I wear this stuff! 
It's not a crème consistency, so careful with how you squeeze the tube!"
188,milani,cheek kiss cream blush trio,pimprod2030332,2590469," * . * The colors online do not match what I received. The bright pink is not as bright and the other two are more mauve and are very similiar to one another. 

Balmy texture that feels completely weightless on tbe skin and easy to blend but I am disappointed with the colors. I'm still on the fence if I should keep. * Balmy formula that sinks into your skin and blends so easily! I use it as blush and as a balm and loved it. Great for summer heat. * You have to layer on the pigment a million times. I normally like Milani products but this blush is a no go, still prefer prestige brands Blush sticks. * I love, blends so beautifully. So creamy! Can add more for more color tone! Never patchy. My favorite ever, all I do is recommend * Wonderfully creamy, beautiful colors * First, this handy little palette definitely gets the job done and on a pretty good range of skin tones; however, more shades are needed! These powders have a luxury feel to them. Almost buttery, a little can go a very long way! That being said, if you have VERY light skin tones, you're going to want to go in with a light hand and build! On the other hand if you have dark skin tones, you're going to be able to load up your brush and apply. They do build nicely; still though too much of a good thing is too much. So while I absolutely love this concept like the many ""multiple steps palettes""  out there, it's not a one size fits all. Unfortunately finding that one size fits all is extremely hard to find in this department; that's the beauty of people being different! 
In the end, it's a fantastic little palette that I'd highly recommend; especially in an MUA bag or any makeup lovers collection that could benefit from these shades. Great price for great formulas. Now let's see more and more."
189,j.cat beauty,blush-mallow soft blusher,pimprod2014270,2564789," * There's a lot of color payoff with just a little swipe, so be careful. You do get a lot for what you pay, which is great. I should point out that Dolly Peachy is actually more orange than it is peach. So if you're looking for something more peachy, this might not be it. I'm very happy with my purchase and I'll be getting other shades. * For some reason I was thinking that this shade would be a lighter version of Thank You Berry Much, but it's straight up copper shimmer, like some kind of bronzer from the early '00s. Maybe it'll make a fun eyeshadow? It doesn't help that the larger picture of the shade isn't even the correct shade. Please fix this, Ulta! * I have a medium-tan, neutral skin tone. The formula is a nice soft matte and it easily picked up on a relatively dense synthetic brush. Thank You Berry Much! is nowhere near a berry color. It's more like a muted, deep coral, verging into terracotta/clay territory. Berries N' Cream is a true berry and is very pigmented. I have to use a sparse brush in order to not deposit too much color. I think it would show up great on deeper skin tones. * I bought the shade Baby Mochi, and use this as an eyeshadow rather than a blush (too deep for me). The formula is a little putty like and reminds me of CP SS Shadows. Super pigmented, super smooth. Would recommend 👌 * Quality is sooo good! * I love this blush and it was so cheap. It lasts really long and the color is beautiful * Its very pigmented and such a pretty color I would definitely buy again."
190,physicians formula,butter believe it! blush,pimprod2034051,2592826," * I have spent forever looking for a blush that looks natural on my fair skin without making me look sunburned.  This blush goes on light, but is buildable. It even looks pretty without foundation on.  I love the little brush it comes with. * Pink Sands gives a beautiful silky finish to a bare face or as a light brush over foundation. I dont use it as a blush, its so pretty as an all over look. Very soft look for my dry face. I've been using pink sands version for years. * just wish the color payout was a little better. I had to rub my blush brush really hard and many times into the pan and build to get much color on my skin. It's a beautiful shade, though. If you're looking for something subtle, this would be great for you. * I like the color ok but wish there was more actual product. Included is a tiny brush and mirror that will never get used. Too much packaging. * i'm a blush fanatic. i love trying new ones. i also love physicians formula. i had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately there's little to no color payoff. i was highly disappointed. i want to like it, but i'm afraid i just don't. * Pretty buttery and gives a subtle glow. However this shade would only show up on fair to light skin. * I would have to use the entire compact to get any color, barely shows up and my skin tone is on the medium olive side. Dave your money. I gave it 3 stars because maybe it will work better for those with super fair skin."
191,essence,electric glow colour changing lip & cheek oil,pimprod2040239,2611070," * I am asked so often as to what I put on my lips that make them look so wonderful and this product is that answer. I have bought this several times to gift and will continue to do so. * The product is great for the price, i use it mostly on my cheeks and it gives me a nice flush, i do think it feels a bit thin on lips but I usually put balm on after, overall for the price its worth it. It also rated good on yuka. * Feels like olive oil on your lips drys out i like the color but not for me * It puts tint on my lips and stays once it's dry. It works better than my $30 lipgloss * I have very pale lips so when I tried out this and realized that it stained very well and very pink it was game over for all other lip stains! It also lasts a very long time and I really recommend putting a clearish pinky lip gloss on top and it looks flawless.! * The gloss changes to a super pretty natural pink color, however, it was very drying to my lips. * As a fair, warm olive complexion, I struggle with finding pink blushes/lip colors that don't look like I'm channeling my mom's look from the 1980s. Even though this turns incredibly pink on me, it's a pretty natural-looking flush.

This product works great as a blush, especially if you're into sunburn or igari style blush application. I recommend applying with fingertips (wash after unless you like pink fingers) or a sponge (which will be hot pink forever after, no matter how much you wash it). Despite the instant, permanent stain on my beauty blender, the blush is pretty forgiving and buildable over a sunscreen or primer — definitely need to be more careful over a tinted moisturizer or foundation, though. 

I don't love using this alone on my lips, as it is definitely a bit drying and has an almost soapy taste to it, but it settles in quickly and acts more like a lip stain than a gloss or oil. I like to add a lip balm or gloss over the top for  a moisturized, just-bitten look."
