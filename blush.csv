A TINY buy goes a long way, and i mean tiny! It blended out well for me. I know others mentioned that it didn't for them. * Love it and extremely pigmented * This would not blend in. Wherever I started with my blush brush it would leave a circle and no amount of blending will fix it. Horrible * Awesome * Tried this blush after social media has been giving reviews of it. It is smooth, good coverage, go light with darker shades.  It wears well for me. Very soft powder. * These are pigmented but blendable. I have 5 shades and do love them. It is easy to go overboard with them due to how pigmented they are. Also love thag they come in both a glowy and matte formula. * I highly recommend this product its smooth on the skin doesn't look powdery it has a nice shower but not over whelming. If you like a natural but shower blush this is for you. I love it because it also doesn't look like I just spilled glitter on my face."
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,perricone md,no makeup blush,pimprod2004408,2541775," * This is by far my favorite EVER blush!! I have goofy combo skin and some fine lines-this blush goes on so nicely and it doesn't make my face look more oily in my t zone and it does not settle into drier skin and lines! Absolutely worth the price and I hope they never stop making this blush! * I love this and the color but it used to have spf in it. Now it's just a regular blush. I noticed the brand has been doing away with the products being spf. Which is a shame since that's the reason I stocked up in early spring. Now since it has no spf, I am in no hurry to purchase. I still miss there spf gloss that used to be this color. * I've been using this blush for over a year now and I love this stuff!  I have dry, flaky skin and using powder blush accentuates my dry spots. This blush gives me a beautiful glow with some added moisture.  Long lasting and beautiful! I really think this blush would be good for all skin types especially dryer skin, a little goes a long way! * I love this blush in the summer when I need a bit of a boost on my cheeks for going out after doing some sun loving activities. I have sensitive skin, so when working outdoors I can only have sunscreen. Due to the sunscreen in the blush this helps being able to put some neutral makeup on for work without the risk of my face getting sunburned with regular makeup. I love the neutral color. Perricone MD used to sell an spf lipgloss in this color as well, I wish they brought back the lipgloss as it smelled great and worked fantastically. * CONS 
1. This blush burnt my skin. 
I applied the blush almost daily for several months. 2 weeks ago the skin on my cheek bones where the blush touched (in the exact shape I apply my blush) got a terrible allergic reaction: painful, red, extremely dry and bumpy. It has been several days of using soothing skincare, and the irritation is still there, although very slowly subsiding. 
2. As other reviewershave mentioned, the cap cracks easily when you screw the top closed. 

PROS 
The shade is buildable and starts very subtle. I have light skin, cool undertone, and this blush looked beautiful. * i only used this once or twice. i screwed the cap on too tight one time and the lid breaks and the stopper sank to the bottom. please replace the cheap plastic with metal. * I love the color of this blush and it blends beautifully. Big drawback though is the packaging. The lid completely cracked when I tightened it. I love this blush but now I can't take it anywhere. Please fix this packaging!!!!!"

The lasting power is super normal for any Dewey formulated blush. It has this blowing affect. I don't think they advertise, but it's one of my favorite things about it. Overall, please never get rid of this shade. The color and undertones are exactly what I've been looking for for years. * It looks good and I got the dusty rose shade and on my skin tone it looks so good and for reference I am pretty pale but but not like super pale I can tan pretty easy * This is a super pigmented blush and after one dot I look like a clown. Please splurge on a different blush. The bare minerals on is awesome! * A little goes a long way! I bought the Comin' in hot pink and the orange one for a cure sunset blush moment. I docked one star because when I use my beauty blender to blend it, the product settles into my pores and it looks very splotchy. I found it was best to just blend with mt fingers. * More pigmented than the rare beauty. Could be a bit hard/take longer to blend and can dry easily so blend it right away. * The color payoff is great since it's so pigmented. A little goes a long way so it'll last forever. Color is great and it's super easy to blend. * I cannot tell you how much this leaks. It gets all over my other products. I only do about 3 tiny spots and when I blend it out I am a pink mess. Would not repurchase again. Bad Rare Beauty dupe."

The packaging is disappointing- It could've been much better. The quality of the blush is OK. There are much better lower priced brands out there. The shade is nice however it is very similar to others that I already have. I will probably end up returning this. * It's very pigmented. I get it now why it's overhyped over tiktok and instagram, some people are hating it because at first it will not really show on your skin, but pro tip you should use a dense blush on brush and it's going to be amazing. It's perfect for my medium-neutral Asian skintone :) * not my favorite blush but its cute and the i love the packaging. sad because the first shade i recieved was defective or something because the glue holding the pan to the container unstuck? the pan just flies and bounces around in there, but the second one i got didn't have the same problem. cute shades okay price * This is a good product for the skin, and it give a great glow. I bought cherry, and i thought it would be a big size but when it came in it was small. This made me think it was not worth the price, I would recommend this to a rich friend. This is a 4. * I was iffy about this blish since some reviews are negative but i decided to try it myself. It's actually pigmented and vibrant! I use a liquid blush before than too it off with this one and it stays all day! Love love love * This is a beautiful blush. I bought Rosewood. * I was disappointed with this blush. It's not exactly on the cheaper end and it's small. I bought mahogany and it makes me look dirty or muddy no matter how lightly I put it on. So sad."

This is my first water tint and when I first used it, I didn't expect it to actually have the consistency of water lol. That's fine. I've used it for a month or so now and I wouldn't say it's my favorite. It gives a light pigmented look on the lips after a couple applications but because it's water-based, the stain doesn't really last long. I've only used it on my lips but I will probably only use it as a backup blush after this experience. * I got this when it was most popular it good I guess but it leaves your skin and doesn't show up after 1 millisecond it not worth it considering the price I love benefit but this was just not it if you like it and read this review look up eccesents what a tint lip and cheak tint it will save you 20 dollars 😊 * Its so good * Color doesnt last
But still ok * It just last a while and goves you that sunkissed look * Same great benatint but I don't love the brush applicator. I miss the doe foot features in the smaller size and although this is a great deal I'm not overly fond of the brush so I would not recommend this product.  It's not even a good brush. Does not apply well to cheeks. Just buy the regular size and get the far superior applicator. * I will not buy this again. It is too watery. I was looking for something that would be softer and a nice feeling on my lips. This did not make my lips feel good."
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,nars,blush,pimprod2044741,2621261," * I absolutely cannot believe what NARS has done to orgasm.  It was the most re-purchased product in my entire makeup bag, now I'm done.  The last one I purchased (post 'reformulation) is complete and utter garbage.  Nothing but a shimmer bomb mess with zero color payoff.  Horrible product!  In a time when so many companies are 100% in their blush game, NARS has done themselves in.  Buh-bye. * I liked this ar first, but with time I feel its hard for the brush to pickup the product and you hardly get any on your face. * I have been using Nars blush in orgasm for 15+ years. I recently received my new blush in the refillable packaging and it does NOT come out. Basically, NO product appears on my blush brush! Why change the formulation?!?!! Product deserves rating ZERO! * Orgasm 777 requires so much on the brush to show up on my face. (My skin tone is light to medium) For the cost, it's not pigmented enough. Like many others, I've been a longtime user of this beautiful blush in the color Orgasm. I've probably purchased 100 over the years and recommended it to everyone. I understand reformulating to remove talc (which never bothered me, btw) but WHY change the color and/or put so much shimmer that it takes WAY more to even show up on my face?
I need another blush. * I had the old formula in Orgasm and didn't like it; too dry. This new one is almost creamy and has much more pigment. I bought the shade Rush, which is perfect with my tan, a sort of cross between blush and bronzer. Overpriced so I can't give it a 5. * The new formula is talc free, but not nearly as pigmented. The swatch of Orgasm is super disappointing. Shimmery but extremely sheer. Orgasm X is now closer to the old original Orgasm. I'm so sad because I am almost out of Orgasm. I don't think I will be repurchasing. * This is a good product just not pigmented. Good shade range."

It is so smoth to apply, easy to blend in with just your finger, abd look absolutely amazing if you're going for the ""No makeup makeup look"" Would highly recommend! * I love this product, as a young mom I don't get much time to take care of myself but this just is so simple,quick and easy to put on! * Its easy to use the only thing is that it does not last long and u have to reapply * love it good amount of product to * This is TERRIBLE it has NO PIGMENT whatsoever.

I have also used it on my eyelids as a eyeshadow which I have liked to coordinate my lip, cheek and eye color. * such a great shade. soooo creamy! great price too * These were my first two PUR products. I was won over by the creaminess with light coverage. I have shades Bronze Babe I use for contour. Then I have Berry Blast I use for blush. These are very versatile sticks can use for face, eyes, lips. They spread well and if you need more color, then just add more. Absolutely obsessed with these. * Saw these with Jamie Greenberg so I bought today in store. Literally soooo blendable. A dreamy product. Great price. * I purchased the Berry Best and it glides on smoothly and so easy to blend in with my fingers.   Color is great! * This brand is sooo under rated. I am truly obsessed with this stick in Coral Cosmo!! It is the perfect peachy coral for spring. So buildable. * Has a gorgeous finish by itself or worn over foundation, and blends easily with fingers or a sponge. I got the shade ""berry best,"" and it is such a pretty color."

Love! 10/10 * I like this blush a lot, i like the pink shades on there own or over some cream blush. Still good and super pigmented * Blush is chalky and overhyped. Save your money. * I really love this blush. You can easily layer on top of foundation or liquid blush and get a nice blend. It is extremely pigmented so you dont need a lot. I got the volume 4 shade and it has the prettiest baby pink. Would buy again and recommend! * I bought this blush for my younger sister and she raves how good it is. Her makeup always looks good as well the blush. Looks flawsless 🩷 perfect dupe for the dior * I love it so much its easly to blend and so cute and very pigmented and i can carry it everywhere which is great!!  I highly recommend it!!!"

It's really creamy and easily blendable. * I love this product for someone with textured skin or large pores. It does not settle. I love the glowy, flushed from within, look it gives. Pairs beautifully with other liquids powders and creams. You really cant beat the price and performance. Highly reccomend the Morphe cream blush brush they sell with this. It is amazing for any cream cheek product. * Super great blush! Be careful! Pigmented and so creamy that I pushed down to hard and ruined the swirl! * Very hydrating and very pigmented.  I do not recommend for the ""oily girls"" because the product is VERY hydrating.  I definitely recommend for mature faces! * I love how pigmented and creamy it is. And the price. Loving all the colors too. * rlly like this blush its not greasy and i love the color i got , which is intoxicated * I love this product. I think it is going to last a long time! I use it over a cream to powder foundation and it works like a charm. However, it is very pigmented so be careful with your dips. Start light and build up."

Super easy to blend with, j prefer a brush.  I don't like my blush to look harsh so I only dip mg brush one time. * i want to love this dont get me wrong but im struggling to find the perfect color for me. i've purchased and returned 2 blushes now because they turn out too orange on me every time. * I would exclusively stick to Nars blush. After purchasing this during one of the sales, I'll never go back. I have both Candy Clouds and Golden Hour. It is quite pigmented so a little will go a long way. The blush blends seamlessly and I will keep it in my make up collection. I highly recommend! * I have 2 of these and I live them. Super cute packaging, nice scent (chocolatey), blurring, and gorgeous shades. Candy clouds is my favorite shade and blush ever * Love everything I purchased * okay so i like this blush because the color is cute, its more of a natural finish and the packiging is just mwah but it is so hard to open (the bronzers are the same packigining but easy to open) and it has a not bad but not pleasent very strong smell to it.

P.S. the smell might be different from person to person because it didnt smell bad to me it was just very strong but my friend said she hated the smell of it and it was too strong. * i loved it!!"

So, if you do buy this you really only need to put a dot smaller than a crumb and you will still get a decent amount of blush on your face. Also, if you put it on bare skin, it does stain, especially if you put a ton of it on. That's really the only thing I don't like about it. I mean obviously you're not supposed to put it on just bare skin but if you do then that's what happens. But I really do like this blush, it will definitely last you a long time. * I absolutely love this blush. I was searching for a dupe of the Armani Luminous Silk Cheek Tint and found this while playing around at Ulta. It is HIGHLY pigmented, but do not shy away from it! It has a learning curve to it when finding your level of color. It is a lovely thick liquid and the textire is smoooooooth. Do NOT apply directly to your face unless you want to look like a clown and if you ARE going for a clown look, please enjoy the bright beautiful payoff! < 3 * This liquid blush is way to heavy. A tiny spot goes a LONG way. Just know that one dot on each cheek is way too much. * I havent been the biggest fan of cream or liquid products as they seem to be absorbed by my skin throughout the day and dont last… BUT THESE. Holy smokes!!! I don't think I have used anything as pigmented as these!! I have to actually dot it onto a paper towel and then work into my brush before applying to my cheeks to make sure I don't overdo it. These are beautiful and truly last alllllll day! * Really need very very little to use. Be careful. * Honestly get it now. It will literally lasts you a life time, it sit gorgeous under powders or by it self, AND THAT PIGMENT DONT PLAY. Just get it, thank me later💕‼️ * 100% my favorite liquid blush on the market. you only need a very small amount to cover the entire cheek so it makes the bottle last forever! the pigment is CRAZY and lasts all day on my oily skin. its super blendable and buildable to your liking. cannot recommend this one enough. in"

Im always trying to cover the redness. I love all three shades of the lighter one. The highlighter is amazing looks good everywhere. I wear it as eyeshadow also. Im shocked but i love the blush. Thanks again tarte!!! * This palette is amazing!! The bronzer is the perfect shade, im light-medium skin tone and i find it perfect. The blushes are gorgeous!! Pigmented and beautiful! I kind of compared the blushes to the new rare one, but i like this better. I really recommend this palette, if you can find it, run for it! * I was so excited to see Tartes new glow bar the colors are perfect for summer * The blushes and highlighter in this palette are pigmented and gorgeous!!! * I bought this and have been lovong the sparkling blushes and the highlighter. These are super pigmented and pretty for spring and summer * I was hesitant to order this palette seeing there wasn't any reviews & also knowing the lack of tone range within Tarte's line however....this is beautiful!! I ordered the 'Berry Bar' ((darker one)) and it does compliment my skin tone perfectly, which is medium to tan in most makeup lines. I can get A LOT of color payoff using a light hand,  every color has a dewy glow, and lasted thru my 10 hour work day. The only critique I can imagine would be the bronzer not working for anyone darker than a tan skin tone. If you have a deep color, the bronzer may just give you a pretty glow without a pigment. Overall, I really like this palette thus far & can most def see me reaching for this more than not!"

Sadly, the applicator wipes off anything I have underneath making it look steaky or as though I missed an area. I was expecting it to be a little more pigmented, 3-4 application to get to desired results. I'd pass on this one. * I really like this product because it's pretty and pink. the sade I recommend is rose you slay. the tip is also very nice and makes it easy to put on. * I like the colors this product has, but its very hard to blend and takes off the makeup you have under it.

Super creamy and easily blends. The case is cute and works great and the product lasts a long time even with daily use! * Love this hybrid gel cheek duo * I purchased the Grapefruit and Caramel color. I tried it out with my fingers and a brush.

The good;
-Pretty colors. They swatch mat but do blend out sheer and become part of the skin. 
-Elegant formulation with a creamy and light feel on the skin. 
-Easy to use, compact and portable.
-No discernable scent. 
-Neither the bronzer nor the blush have any glowy particles. 

The not so good;
-I am fair but cool toned and ALL the colors are warm on me. Why Stila, why? 
-Once applied the blush and bronzer become sheer and the colors disappear as they blend in. 
-I had to do multiple layers before I could truly see any color payoff.
I am tempted to purchase a darker color combination just so it would show up. 

Overall this is a clever, very convenient, and  portable product. Perhaps great for on the go touchups. But it is so sheer and blends out on my skin so much that there is virtually nothing left. * I really like this Stilla Blush & Bronze Hydro-Blur cheek duo. It blebds well and looks so natural. Its not sticky or tacky at all. It doesnt turn orange color either.  Doesnt look fake. * Based on the photos, I'd have shied away from the intense shades but they really sheer out on my light olive skin so I'm so glad I saw them in person because I would've ended up picking a lighter shade (and I might do that, too). Loving the Guava! It is lasting longer than powder blush (even with a setting spray) and is super convenient to throw into my bag for on the go touch ups. I even dabbed some of the bronzer side on in my crease when I was out and my eyeshadow needed a little pick me up. SOLD!!! * Not nearly as good as the Dibs beauty version. Didn't blend well and came off within an hour"

I have somewhat fair skin but I self tan in the summer & this just gives off the most beautiful, glowy look on either way my skin looks. So blendable and the orgasm shade is beautiful! * I am an older woman, 77, and very few wrinkles. My skin is not dry. I'm very fair and powder blush just does not sit right on my skin unless it's a very light color. I am a retired makeup artist so I do know a few things about application of product. I decided to try a liquid blush or creme blush. I did a lot of research and found Nars Afterglow. I find just 4-6 dots in a triangle pattern from cheek to ear blended with a beauty blender looks great. Natural color and not garish at all. It stays all day long for me. I've used other brands that are cheaper and fairly good, but for me, this really works both colorwise and staying power. The quality is excellent. * I spent years looking for a pink liquid blush. My skin is olive and all products I had seen and used made me look orange. Nobody wants to look orange! I finally found NARS Afterglow. It was just what I wanted. I have been using it for 3 years and I now have a healthy glow instead of looking like I am wearing a Halloween mask. Thank you for this wonderful product! * As someone who loves blush and is usually lighter than the lightest shade of foundation for most western brands, this is the most perfect blush products. It is pigmented, but also applies sheer, which is perfect because a lot of products that have a base to them make me look like a clown. This adds such a beautiful, natural glow. I love it! * I purchased the lilac color and it is so beautiful, but the second you blend it, all the color is completely gone. Ive never wanted a make up product to work more than this one. The color was exactly what i wanted, and was unable to find in any other brand, but it completely disappears. I tried to make this work in any way i could think of but it failed. * Idk why everyone else is saying this product wears off after 2 hours, mine lasts all day!! I went on a very long hunt for a liquid blush that showed up on my tan/olive skin that didnt make me look like a clown. This stuff is by far the best!! 3 dots on each cheek and blend with a beauty blender, sooooo natural looking but definitely adds color! * Id say right now i have normal to dry light/medium skin.   Ordered 2 different colors and although both colors were beautiful neither of them stayed on.   I tried without primer, with primer,  with setting spray, with out setting spray i even tried layering powder blush on top. This does not stay on.   For the price i expected so much more.   I much prefer the elf camo blushes or juvia.  Those stay on so much better at a fraction of the cost."

I bought it in color ""pink"" and use 2 dots on each cheek. I lightly blend it with a small blush brush but think a wet beauty blender would work too. With the leftover, I dot the brush on my eyelids and tip of my nose. It's really great for summer over a light SPF tinted moisturizer. The price is a bit much for tarte…but I love it.

My Mom said it's the prettiest blush she's ever seen on me... but I realized it does not last all day. I also feel that the ""pink"" shade looks slightly orange/peachy on me.

I use three dots on each side then blend with a blush brush and it gives me the perfect color. I've used it with multiple foundations and it has been perfect everytime. * I am shocked by so many people disliking this product. I love it! I use two dots and blend it in with my fingers. It seems a lot of people say it doesn't blend well with a brush. I use my fingers and it blends really nicely. I am very pale and got the coral one and love the pop of color it gives me. I was wearing a pink powder blush and wanted something different. This works great for me. * I love the texture and feel of this blush, it makes my skin glow * I use the tarte contour and highlighter like this and love them but this blush is not it for me. It feels like when I blend it's just all coming off on the brush or the sponge and I've tried both. I'll keep using it until I'm out but won't buy again."

No more messy powder blocks breaking all over my travel bags. Its clean, simple, small, and literally amazing. I am so happy the store representative recommended it to me! * Ive been using this without any foundation and it works wonderfully. Works with liquid foundation (not a fan of liquid doundation though). 
But ontop of my powdered foundation it becomes super cakey and its hard to blend. 
I love the hot pink color, and the fact its made from Too Faced founders. It also stays on for awhile. Wish it worked better when i put on powder foundation. * The reviews were so great for this blush, i had to try it…Shade paris on light/medium skin is sheer, the product does not glide onto the skin well, and the amount of product you get for $30 almost made me fall over. 

I tried it over and under Givenchy prisme libre setting powder to test the formula and i am just simply not impressed. 

Two stars, only because everyone else seems to like it on here * The blush goes on easily on clean skin. I put it directly on my cheekbones and into my temple. I've been using my fingertips to blend into my desired area. It is a little tricky because it is real easy to over blend and have uneven cheekbones. Other then that I really like the blush. Love the texture. I am going to try using a brush and see if that works better for blending. * I decided to order these after watching some swatch videos. I purchased Paris, Sydney and Palm Springs. I ended up returning Paris and kept Sydney and Palm Springs. They're very pigmented, easy to apply and the amount is controlled with a brush although fingers work just as well. The finish is a powdery matte and does not make foundation budge when applied. I will be repurchasing these when I run out. They're small and compact enough to bring anywhere! * I generally use a medium foundation and when i am tanner during the summer i end up in medium-tan or maybe a tan shade if i have the luxury of being out and about more than usual. Currently i am in medium and the Los Angeles color has this white cast, like putting flour on my face with the pink. Not my favorite. It does go on smooth. I will give the product that much. * Absolutely LOVE this blush stick. The color is pigmented without being overpowering, and it lasts well throughout the day. It sets quickly, so make sure you're ready to blend as soon as you apply"

Im sure its a beautiful color, but theyre both broken to the point where i cannot even use them at least once. Im returning both unfortunately. * This blush is absolutely beautiful!! Not only do I glow to the gods but it lasts!! I literally plan on buying them all!! * The texture freaked me out at first, but it's so light and creamy. It's great for my older skin. * At a certain point, I moved from powder to creme blush and I've tried most, this at the top. I apply this formula with a beauty blender and it goes on so well. Application is easy and the color (blush please) is subtle and perfect on my light to medium color skin. My only complaint? I'd love to see more colors! * I was searching for a product that blends easily and stays on...this is it * Bought this on a whim and loved it so much that i bought 2 more!! Blush please is my favorite on my fair skin for everyday, but they're all great! I put them over powder and they don't disrupt anything underneath, and they give my cheeks a very subtle but healthy glow. The blend is seamless and they have great lasting power with me working a 12 hour shift!! Highly recommend, these deserve more hype! * I have used SO MANY different blushes, but this one I can't get over! I got it in the shade blush please which given my fair completion, shows up more peachy. Its creamy, but works beautifully on both bare skin and powder which is why I love it!"

I have fair skin and this was so non existent on me. It was so disappointing. The highlighter is pretty but not worth keeping the whole thing. After setting spray the color was pretty much gone from both the bronzer and blush. I'm returning it. * The bronzer and blushes are a light pigment.  I can appreciate this for a quick everyday natural, no chance to over do it look but then they put Becca's highlight formula with it. Blinding and shimmery. It doesn't make for a cohesive look. * I have this palette in Back to Cali and love it. I'm fair-skinned with dark hair and these shades look amazing on me. I consider myself a novice in the contouring game and feel like this is an approachable option for my other newbies. The contour shade is a lighter color but it is also buildable. The blush colors are very pretty and easy to blend. I can't wait to try it in other shades! * I really hate this product. I typically love all the reccomendations i get but this, this was the biggest flop. 
It doesnt work at all! Barely leaves any pigment on my face (only after i wet it). Its completely awful and it sucks. 
Please dont buy this!!!! * I've used smashbox contour pallets for years and I've loved all the ones I've tried, the colors and pigmentation are great. I had been using the Cali contour and debated getting the same but decided to try this one. The colors are amazing! * Im not a huge fan of the blush colors but I like the contour color

Its not a great palette, its alright * I was so excited for this face palette! I got it in the Cali colorway. It swatches fine, and I swatched it in the store before I ordered it online. The ones in the store are open all the time, so I didn't notice a smell then. But when I open the one I bought, there is such a strong scent of old perfume mixed with old crayons that I can still smell all day after applying it on the face. The lid won't stay open, it flops right down no matter what I do. The highlighter is supposed to be champagne pop, but it isn't. I have an original becca one, and the one in this palette is chunkier, darker, and more peachy. The bronzer doesn't pick up well at all, I have to apply 5 layers before it starts to show, and I've tried several different synthetic and Japanese brushes. The blushes are patchy and none of this lasts on the face, it fades patchy as well. The blushes seem pigmented when swatched, but don't apply that way to the face. The formula seems like it's supposed to be gelee. I love gelee formulas, but this is a terrible version."

It still looks good, I just wish it was actually more pink * I'm not sure how this hasn't gone viral, but this deserves accolades as a blush! 

It's VERY pigmented- I looked like a clown on first application, but when built up gives the most stunning flush of color with a little inner glow. I have copper and rose, but will get the other two deeper colors once they've restocked. For reference, I have tan neutral skin"

It's been at least 5 years since I bought any but Honeysuckle seriously caught my eye so I brought it home. It's absolutely gorgeous; very slightly less pigmented than I thought it would be given how deep the pan color is, but I'm quite fair skinned so that works for me. Drama was next on my list. The shade in the pan is a GORGEOUS poppy red, I've been waiting for Tarte to make this shade literally for years now(!!!). But I brought it back the next day - there is almost no pigment in this shade. I had to really pack it on and in the end, it was nearly identical to Tipsy (a vibrant coral) - more coral than red. I also swatched some of the old colors in their new formula and it was pretty disappointing. Some of them are kind of ashy, and others are decidedly not the same color as my older products.

Basically I feel like a lot of these shades are now duds. Not all of them, but enough that I honestly can't recommend them anymore. * This is a fave that I will purchase over and over. Trying a new shade - it'll be better for winter months! * Perfect color for my light olive skin tone. * I received a sample in the shade parrtty and I was a bit hesitant to use since it was a shade I normally would not wear but to my surprise it was absolutely beautiful amd lasts all day. I love how easy it is to apply too! Thank you for the sample ulta I'm hooked! I ended up buying the full size product. * Love this product, it's so easy to use as an all over color for summer. Perfect amount of sun kissed glow. * Was looking for a new blush for Spring/Summer, and stumbled upon this at my local Ulta.  Clay?  What is this?  Gave it a try (my selected color is Seduce) - wow!  So natural looking, just the right about of color, and buildable for an evening out!  Apply it to the apples of your cheeks, but also to your chin, forehead (over your brows) for a sun-kissed day-time look - it gives you a lovely glow!  I have used other Tarte products, and really liked them, but this - I love it!  So glad I found it!"

I got it in the shade pink pop and it is SO pigmented! * I wanted to love this blush, the color is very natural and it lasts a while, but its trickier than just a quick dab and im out the door, i am not precise on my makeup, i like doing my makeup fast and efficiently. I had heard alot about this blush, it seemed easy and the colors were beautiful, i gave it a try at first the application was easy, but the blending took a long time and i was getting impatient, i wasnt able to build & blend, but at last it set and i was fine. The following day i open it and the product was everywhere. I hate being wasteful but i had to wipe everything off because it was dripping, i had closed it tight after i used it so i was confused as to why it spilled everywhere. Color is gorgeous, the applying is what really sucks and the messiness of it, its hard to continue its use so i just stopped. * The cons about this product is that after one use it will get very massy and will spill and leak out of the bottle. In my opinion I would not recommend this product. * I have been spying this blush in Dream Pop for a few months and finally bit the bullet and bought it. I LOVE it. Its pigment is gorgeous and buildable. Lasts for hours. Hands down my new favorite blush. * This blush is actually the best I've ever worn. I have mature skin that tends to be oily with patches of flaky dryness. This blush looked amazing despite those flaws. I have both the pink and the red blushes and both are great for different reasons. I use the pink for ann every day flush. When I want to add a little bit more color, especially at night, I use the red. A little goes along way. 

I cannot recommend this enough. Excellent!! * I really like this blush.  I have tried a variety of liquid and cream blushes and this is good.  It is a little more matte than I would like and it dries quick so you should only apply it to one side at time so you have plenty of time to blend it out.  I recommend a beauty blender"

Then I started playing with them, individually they are great, but listen, mix both shades of blushes and thank me later! Use the darker blush in the tan set first, and then the pink from the light set on top! Then use the pink highter on top. You're welcome! 10/10 on pigmentation, product value, and packaging. Love CT! * I recently tried the blush and had mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the color was absolutely fantastic. It gave my cheeks a beautiful, natural flush that lasted throughout the day without fading. The pigment was rich, and it blended seamlessly into my skin, providing a radiant, healthy glow.

However, despite the gorgeous color payoff, I encountered a significant downside. Unfortunately, after a few uses, I noticed that the blush caused me to break out. As someone with sensitive skin, this was a major drawback. I had to stop using it to let my skin recover.

In summary, while the Radiant Rose Blush delivers stunning color and great wear, I would caution those with sensitive or acne-prone skin to be aware of potential breakouts. If your skin can handle it, it's a beautiful addition to any makeup routine. * This is one of the best blushes i have ever used! The blush is very pigmented and the highlighter is very nice on the cheek i also love how it has a mirror to! I love the packaging! * I am that girl that never has worn blush seriously in her life, and now I can say that I'm a changed woman! This product has blown me out of the water with how perfect the blush color is & how pretty the highlight pairs with it!

Benetint can be really patchy & I have to be careful applying or it can look extremely fake. (That's why I was seeking an alternative in the first place.) This Essence version is easy to apply, looks extremely natural, and lasted a long time. Adding to that the bargain price and it's a no-brainer to skip Benefit's and get this Essence lovely instead. I mostly use it on my lips, but I did mix some with a little foundation and applied it as blush and it worked perfectly. Would probably work great mixed with moisturizer too. It really does have longevity and a gorgeous, more natural color. * I liked the benetint but didn't want to spend so much on a tint. This is practically the same! I would say it is the same color and dries the same too. Save your money and get this one. Just make sure you blend fast because it does dry fairly quickly * Works just the right amount of product when you put it on and blend it in for your cheeks and leaves a good but not too bright of a stain! * Benetint dupe I love it * Looks lovely on your lips"

It gives me a sun-kissed look if I put some on my nose. I like a dewy look which this product provides. * This is more hydrating than some very expensive lip masks that I use which shall remain nameless. I've put it on at night before and it really locks in the moisture into the next day. This is by far my favorite lip color to use in the winter as it's the most occlusive one I have found. Even after some of the pigment fades, the occlusives and emollients seem to last. The colors are super flattering and it both looks and feels extremely luxurious on the lips. Super high quality product that for me has been worth it. * Amazing color! Very saturated and gives  just a nice pop of color! BEAUTIFUL!! Will purchase again once I'm out."

I was on the fence with the Merlot blush because it appears maroon online, but the color is a more reddish on the skin. You don't need much, as it has super pigment and lasts all day. The first day I wore it, I received a compliment saying how 'fresh' I looked. Win! I imagine this color is great on all skin tones because of the pigment.

I had high hopes for this but this shade, at least, is a total miss for me. * got this blush in the shade ""blazin blush"" and it's really not pigmented at all. i personally dont enjoy overly pigmented things especially blushs but this blush has zero pigment. i had to layer it to even see color and the formula is so liquidy it made my makeup separate underneath. i wanted these to work so bad bc the shade range is so pretty and the concept is also really good. just dont buy!"

Its a really beautiful blush and a very soft glowy color. It is a little light on my more light/medium skintone. If I was to do this again I would buy a more deeper shade, but I have also used blushes in this shade that had more pigment in them. 
Its a lovely product though and makes me feel fancy, so I do not regret the purchase. * Perfect healthy glow! The color of my dreams! I look forward to putting this on! * 57 years old and just found my perfect blush in the color pillow talk. Goes on smooth as silk, gives me the perfect healthy glow and the color is perfection! Holy grail status! * I use the shade pillow talk and it it AMAZING so blendable and pigmented and soft. Looks natrual and glowy. I highly recommend it!"

The color Hint I was told has been discontinued. Liked the loose blush better but this works. * I absolutly love this blush, use it every day and no need for highlighter and the color does show up perfectly but not over power * Will buy again. Gives a natural glow. Love it. * This product is just okay.  Maybe I got the wrong color, I purchased mauve.  It doesn't show up very well but it does give a noce glow.  I debated on returning.  I think the cost is a little high.  Keeping for days when I want to keep it low key. * Amazing blush and highlighter combo; the pigment is incredible * I was honestly a little hesitant to purchase this blush. I wouldn't say my skin tone is fair, but I am definitely not as tan as I normally am this time of year. The color is great and shows up just enough to give me the sun-kissed look I wanted without being too much. * VERY pleased with the bareMinerals GEN NUDE Highlighting Blush in Mauve. It has replaced my current favorite: Haus Labs rose quartz. Would definitely buy again!"

These blushes are gorgeous.  I have Juicy Peach and it is gorgeous on the skin, great color for a pop of peach pink on cheeks!   Yes it has some glitter but not a crazy amount.  I highly recommend! * I have a medium-tan skin tone and I couldn't decide which shade to purchase so I got both Juicy Peach and Baked Peach. They are very similar so you definitely don't need both. Juicy Peach doesn't have a lot of base pigment, it is more like a ""blush topper"", however the glow that it gives the cheeks is stunning, like a peachy/gold reflect. Baked Peach definitely has more of a base color, more like an actual blush. Baked Peach is more pink, the reflect is pink instead of gold. They are both very pretty, depends what look you're going for. I would say even someone with a lighter skin tone could use the darkest shade, as I had to build up to get it to show up (aka not a scary blush) * I love this product for the shimmering glow and rich peach tone! I enjoy the sparkle and it applied easily. I bought the darkest shade. * I got the shade Fresh Peach. It is stunning. Perfect for fair to light skin tones if you want that beautiful light pink flush with gold highlights. When I put it on, it just lights up my face so perfectly with a beautiful glow. I love this and want to get the other colors. Can't get enough. * I wanted to love this so bad because I love the packaging. It looks beautiful in the pan but absolutely no pigment shows up on my face. I bought the lightest shade and tried to build it many times and I ended up really just looking kind of orange with all the gold glitter. Not flattering on my light/medium skin. Going to have to return. :("

The only downside is that it is not the most pigmented but it is buildable. * I bought this blush on whim and I was super surprised! It applied beautifully and was long lasting! It is buildable. I would definitely recommend this blush * so i just got back from Disney World and the main goal of the trip was to try out a new water ride and I was super worried about my makeup staying all night. I decided to try mixing shades pinking of u and strawberry nebula together to get a cute ombre effect. so it ended up being that i rode the ride 6 times in a row. I was in all rows of the log flume and got absolutely soaked to the point where i was dripping. needless to say, when i got back to my hotel room, i looked in the mirror and was shocked to see that my blush still looked amazing after everything i put it through! not only did i get insanely wet on the ride, but i was also sweating from the heat all night, and the blush still looked fantastic!!!!!!!!! this is my new fav blush combo and IT LASTS!!!! * I feel like rem knocked this launch out of the park, i bought 2 shades of their blushes and they're so pretty on the cheeks, they have a blurring effect and theyre so pigmented, one of the best powder blushes ive tried in a long time * I purchased the Strawberry Nebula shade. My skin tone leans towards cool and this color complements it beautifully. I am medium light and I have to apply it sparingly otherwise it can quickly become overly bright. 

The blush formulation is a finely milled powder and applies a translucent veil onto the skin. The beauty of this formulation is that it sinks in and doesn't look like powder once applied. It  looks like a lovely natural watercolor tint on the cheeks. There is no highlight or sparkle yet it doesn't look dull or too matte.
It is easy to apply and blend as long as the skin is dry. Like all powders I wouldn't apply it on a taky or wet surface or it will apply patchy. 

I love powders for ease and quickness of application, but I don't love how many powders sit on top of my skin and look powdery/textured. I like the more natural look of cream and liquid blushes and how they disappear/melt with my skin texture. 

This blush fullfils my wish for ease and speed of application of powders with the natural veil look of creams and liquids.

I also like the compact it is cute and looks unique.

I did try some of the other colors in the line. Many are more subtle and less punchy. 

Overall I am happy with my purchase."

 why or how this just brightens & opens your face, but it does. You literally need a dot or two & I just use my fingers to spread along my cheek bones. It's only slightly challenging to apply bc I'm never quite sure where I should be putting the ""dots"" & exactly what area I should be covering when blending it in. This is probably just bc I never wear any make up, so I really don't have much experience. * I got the pH changing shade and it is cute, easy to apply, lightweight, and natural looking, but it also disappears from my skin after just a few hours. I'm not sure if it just comes off or if the drying of the product leads to the pH reaction to no longer occur and give my cheeks that glow, but I'm not a big fan of how little it lasts for. For reference, I use it on clean skin after skincare with no other base or setting agent. * I absolutely love the BYO Blush Color Changing Oil! It applies so easily and it gives me a natural blush from within look. I always get compliments on it and I have recommended it to all of my friends and family. 100% will be re-purchasing! * This product is a must! It is the perfect shade for my skin and I like that it is buildable if I have a fake tan on. Worth the price and makes my skin dewy * I've always love color changing products.  THE BYO blush changes to my Ph levels and gives me the prettiest natural color.  The blush is not oily, you can reapply more than once.  I use the BYO blush on my lips and eyelids as well. * I love this blush such cute colors t"

one of the best priced blushes on the market now. * No complaints! Pigmented and easily blendable. Set with powder and you're good to go. * Such a good blush and tops most high end brands imo. If you dont like using a lot or are scared of having a very loud blush it might not be for you but for me i always wanted a very pigmented blush and i finally found it! * Very good blush it is very pigmented and can be used without a powder blush to go over it, and you can use it in your bade before adding your setting powders * I am a very fair skinned strawberry blond person who prefers a cream-style blush. Unfortunately, it's hard to find a compatible shade in a cream that doesn't sink into the skin. This one checks  ALL the boxes. It glides on easily, has amazing staying power, and the coral color provides a kiss of color on my fair skin that isn't orange or too red. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the hinge of the compact broke within a relatively short time. Even with this, I am still using it- a little tape fixes it. It lasts a long time as you only need a touch. It is a great blush that I will continue to buy. * super pigmented and it is easy to work with. i live how blendable this formula is and the shades are beautiful. love using this for layering my makeup products"

It lasts all day and night and still looks magnificent when I take my makeup off. I go a little heavy handed with it because I have to set it with powder. I still want the color to show through. I've been using the new CT foundation (the shiny one) with a pore filling primer, the Givenchy Prism Libre powder, this blush, and multiple bronzers. I can't do a makeup look without this now, If I did. I'd feel like something was missing. Beautiful product. * Hoo boy she is pigmented. Got this in worth it dewy and more than one dot on each cheek is too much for my taste. gorgeous sunburnt color for my pale neutral cool skin. If you love that sunburned blush trend then you'd like this specific shade and use more than one dot if you want to become the sunburn.  I have yet to try it over foundation as I am reviewing this only on bare skin for the moment. * This liquid blush is amazing! Especially the  pinky gold shade, this shade eith the new nyx buttermelt blush in the pinky gold shade are literally a match made in heaven. This blush is easy to blend and easy to control how you viberant you want it to be. All of the shades are incredible, the matte shades are super nice and the shimmer shades are exactly that a shimmer shade, no chunky glitter. * I saw a content creator use this blush and thought it looked beautiful. Of course I immediately ordered it. I used it tonight for my sons graduation... in love! It is a gorgeous blush! I put too much on at first but then went over it with my foundation brush. Put a little more on with the blush brush, powder... perfection. Just buy it. You'll thank me later."

It has a ""lit from within"" look thats not going to emphasize textute. I got it in the color Jersey which is between a rose and warm nutmeg. The blush is a light wash of color that can be built up, but its not designed for vibrancy. Great for those who want a natural blush thats not shimmery or completely matte. I find the color and texture true to luxury makeup. It has longevity, and stays on my skin through an 8 hour work day. 

If youre not into subtle formulas then this isnt for you. There are more vibrant blushes that costs a fraction of the price. If you enjoy luxury makeup or like ultra milled baked powder then this could be an option. * I like this color and texture * I love this !! Its flirty not to bright not to dark it's perfect for those that have olive under tone! * While I wanted to love this blush, I found the coverage was minimal unless I use ALOT of product.  For the price, I won't buy again. * I love this blush! A nice natural glow feels amazing and last a long time. I will definitely buy again * Perfect everyday blush - give perfect amout of pigment and the packaging is very chic :)"

Using just a little gives me a nice peachy flush that lasts all day. It's buildable too if I want a bit of a brighter color. * Bought ""Fake the Flush"" because I needed to add something to get to a specific total. Its amazingly beautiful, blends so easily, not super pigmented ( with blushes, in my opinion, there's a thing as too much pigment  ) and less than $2.00, I was not expecting to love it like I do. * This blush did not have great reviews when I bought it and that's why I am here. Honestly, this product is amazing and I don't want people to pass it over. It is blendable, buildable, easy to travel with, plays well with others, and has a beautiful finish. It works well with my sensitive, acne-prone, and combination skin. I love this even more than the elf liquid blush, which tends to be so pigmented that you can overdo your blush easily. However, this blush is very beginner-friendly and you don't run the risk of looking crazy. I think it works best when blended gently with your fingertips. A very small amount goes a long way. Added too much? No biggie, just keep blending with your fingertips. One small drop is enough to cover both cheeks, so this will last you forever. 1st layer gives a 'sheer blush from within' kind of look. You can make it more pigmented with more layers. I will be purchasing more colors and keeping this as my new travel blush. The squeeze tube is about the size of a lip balm and the packaging is cute too. This is very multi-use. You can use it as blush, eyeshadow, or a subtle lip stain. An absolute steal for the price. But the quality is great and this is probably one of the best travel/beginner blushes you will find (regardless of price). * I was reading the reviews and i was really skeptical the bad ones made me not want to buy this product but i gave it a shot and im so thankful because its exactly what i wanted i dont know why people are complaining it blends in great and its a nice color it does kind if smell like sunscreen but 🤷🏼‍♀️ i dont mind. Definitely recommend * I purchased this due to the price bit this actually wowed me. I used it the day after I received the online order and was pleasantly surprised. I used a tad too much and applied the excess on my lips which really tied the look together * This blush is really pretty and I like to mix it with other blushes! It says it's liquid however it looks and feels more like a cream. * Its my favorite boush ever"

The red actually looks orange...and has little color pay off but is the most emollient, long lasting, comforting and delicious smelling lipgloss I have ever owned. Please come out with more colors! Brown, purple, pink would be fabulous. * Thanks ulta 20 days of beauty that allowed me to purchase this for the low to end up loving it. Its my favorite item to complete my new make up make up look. * I have tried forever pink and red. Red is like a bright reddish coral on me, quite warm toned - gave it away to a friend. Pink I kept. A nice, long lasting, moisturizing lip and cheek stain. Dewy/tacky for a bit on the cheeks after application. I have to note that I do not love the scent and it's strong. Fruity. Not something I could use if I had a headache. Otherwise a nice product. * This is a very pretty, natural looking cheek stain in the pink color. Glowy and moisturizing. It is easy to work with. It could be a tad more pigmented and last longer. * My absolute favorite lippie to wear! Gives a great colored stain that lasts all day, it's a bit expensive but it does work really well. It's not sticky at all, very smooth. Fingers crossed Jane Iredale comes out with more colors! * The tube of this product has a sleek design and looks high end/luxury. The  lip stain itself is very smooth, doesnt have any smell and glide nicely on lips. I brought both pink and peach colors and the pigmentation is sheer and natural, and the moisturing power is medium that can soften dryness of lips in certain level but doesnt completely sink down. I feel its a nice product for a daily use or going with a natural look makeup."

You have to use it as a setting blush on top of cream if you want to it hold. Not to mention, the packaging feels so cheap. Some of my drugstore makeup has better eye appeal and structure compared to this. It also comes with a disclosure to be careful, because it's delicate… Hmm I wonder why lol * I have 4 shades of this blush plus a couple of the holiday palettes, and it is my favorite blush formula of all time. You don't need to add highlighter when you use this. Depending on the shade, bronzer is also optional. You get a lot of product for the price, and there is no talc. It's almost impossible to overdo this blush as it is not super pigmented but still you don't need much to get the job done. There is no fragrance. It's just a well made beautiful product. Packaging is also super sturdy. It lasts all day even in hot humid weather and never looks dry or powdery or glittery. You just get a perfect lit from within glow. Everyone should try this at least once. I have repurchased a few of the shades at least a couple of times.

This summer I'm all about the hot pink coral lips and cheeks because it imparts a vibrant and lively look to the face and I can keep the eye look simple with just liner, mascara and a neutral eyeshadow from lid to brow or none at all. There used to be a MAC cream color base called Virgin Isle and I love Electroball way more than that. I ordered the violet one this time around and hopefully it'll look just as fabulous. I'm also going to try it as an eyeshadow and see if it makes my brown eyes pop. * My NB son, 15, wanted to do his face (first time) to go to drag show and loves Pokémon. He's a perfect match to the palest Morphe foundation. I was afraid the cherry red Pikachu blush would be too intense, but it imparted the loveliest cherry red flush and I built it up till it was just amazing.  Now I want my own, his cousin teased that she was going to steal all his Pokémon makeup after seeing how beautiful it looked on. * I got the light pink blush. It is so oily and completely sheer. Trying to rub it into the skin is like rubbing lip balm. 

Tower 28 cream blush is so much more pigmented and not oily. I have no idea why all the products from this launch are so bad, but they are. * I got all three and it seems like its a cream to powder matte finish. They are all sheer and very builable.

It's such any easy light blush and I tend to go for a neutral look. Sometimes... Anyway, 100 out of 10 rating y'all! * I got the shade glimmering guava and there is a lot of glitter, and the pigment in harsh and hard to blend, its very small, and is hard to use because of the noticible glimmer that just sticks out on your face * honestly i haven't tried a huge amount of blushes, but i absolutely LOVE this blush stick. glimmering guava is so shimmery/glittery and is so nicely pigmented; i love the orange/pink shade. for 5 dollars its literally so freaking good buy it rn"

It appears the consistency or formula is different. The lighter bronzer shade was a lot cooler, and was a lot easier to blend out. This looks muddy. But the pink highlight is my asbolute favorite. I wish they sold just the highlight shade by itself.. * This palette is great for everyday! It blends great and lasts forever. * This is my favorite face palette!! I'm obsessed with it I've used it for years I always repurchase. The bronzers and blushes blend so nicely, and all the colors go perfect with my skin tone. I will say I'm not super pale and fair skinned though, to me this is more for medium tan girlies * I love this pallet. I have been looking at this for awhile now and wasn't sure which color to order but I'm glad I went with this one. I think the others would have been too dark. The contour is slightly darker but I can easily use one of the lighter bronzers for contouring. * I found this to be too warm to use for bronzers/ contour. looks very orange and yellow. the blush and highlight are okay though. * Beautiful"

I have goofy combo skin and some fine lines-this blush goes on so nicely and it doesn't make my face look more oily in my t zone and it does not settle into drier skin and lines! Absolutely worth the price and I hope they never stop making this blush! * I love this and the color but it used to have spf in it. Now it's just a regular blush. I noticed the brand has been doing away with the products being spf. Which is a shame since that's the reason I stocked up in early spring. Now since it has no spf, I am in no hurry to purchase. I still miss there spf gloss that used to be this color. * I've been using this blush for over a year now and I love this stuff!  I have dry, flaky skin and using powder blush accentuates my dry spots. This blush gives me a beautiful glow with some added moisture.  Long lasting and beautiful! I really think this blush would be good for all skin types especially dryer skin, a little goes a long way! * I love this blush in the summer when I need a bit of a boost on my cheeks for going out after doing some sun loving activities. I have sensitive skin, so when working outdoors I can only have sunscreen. Due to the sunscreen in the blush this helps being able to put some neutral makeup on for work without the risk of my face getting sunburned with regular makeup. I love the neutral color. Perricone MD used to sell an spf lipgloss in this color as well, I wish they brought back the lipgloss as it smelled great and worked fantastically. * CONS 
1. This blush burnt my skin. 
I applied the blush almost daily for several months. 2 weeks ago the skin on my cheek bones where the blush touched (in the exact shape I apply my blush) got a terrible allergic reaction: painful, red, extremely dry and bumpy. It has been several days of using soothing skincare, and the irritation is still there, although very slowly subsiding. 
2. As other reviewershave mentioned, the cap cracks easily when you screw the top closed. 

PROS 
The shade is buildable and starts very subtle. I have light skin, cool undertone, and this blush looked beautiful. * i only used this once or twice. i screwed the cap on too tight one time and the lid breaks and the stopper sank to the bottom. please replace the cheap plastic with metal. * I love the color of this blush and it blends beautifully. Big drawback though is the packaging. The lid completely cracked when I tightened it. I love this blush but now I can't take it anywhere. Please fix this packaging!!!!!"

I was happy to find a clean blush with a beautiful color but the sparkles are too much. Will be returning. * Really like it! * I have used these little shimmery colored powders for years.  You can add them to your setting powder or use as an added effect after you're all done putting on your makeup. Really gives life to an older complex 
 ion! * I love the Bare Minerals foudnation and faux tan. The blush is pretty but… I have acne scars and the glitter excentuates these scars dramatically. It just doesnt look smooth. The color doesnt last either. I notice that it is gone within minutes of applying. Honestly I will stick with some of my drug store options. * I love the loose blush. I have been using it for years but miss the glee color. It was very popular because i always had a hard time finding it in stock. Why did you discontinue? * I first purchased this 10 years ago and have been consistently repurchasing ever since. Im fair skinned with neutral undertones, and the vintage peach shade is the perfect sunkissed glow on me. I've tried a TON of blushes, from drugstore to high end, and this is the one that is my baseline every day blush. As someone who's very fair, I love that this is buildable for when I want a more vibrant look. 10/10 * The loose powder blush is my go-to everyday product. It's getting harder and harder to find these days. Please don't discontinue this product, make more of it and more colors. I love this blush so much. I'm almost out of mine that I have and can't find it anywhere in store and online. I've been waiting for about 2 years now for Ulta to restock it. What's going on??"

Wherever I started with my blush brush it would leave a circle and no amount of blending will fix it. Horrible * Awesome * Tried this blush after social media has been giving reviews of it. It is smooth, good coverage, go light with darker shades.  It wears well for me. Very soft powder. * These are pigmented but blendable. I have 5 shades and do love them. It is easy to go overboard with them due to how pigmented they are. Also love thag they come in both a glowy and matte formula. * I highly recommend this product its smooth on the skin doesn't look powdery it has a nice shower but not over whelming.

They are pigmented and easy to blend - however i wish they came out with more shades as well. Other than that, highly recommend! * I take this with me in my work bag on a day to day basis as part of my emergency makeup kit when I'm running late to work. This also goes with me in my travels - compact and 3-in-1! It's very similar to Kaja's for a fraction of the price. 

Oily skin people - I set these with powder and finish with setting spray to keep them from getting me too oily (I've got combo skin), but if you're very oily, these not be for you. 

Ulta - please make more shades and make an affordable version of Kaja's bentobox eyeshadow trios next! * I personally adore this one. Very lovely for a glow and skin like finish. Handy. 
The pigment is very nice. Does not last all day. This product feels like an oily tacky lipstick. Be advised based on your own skin texture :)). ......................."

The packaging is disappointing- It could've been much better. The quality of the blush is OK. There are much better lower priced brands out there. The shade is nice however it is very similar to others that I already have. I will probably end up returning this. * It's very pigmented. I get it now why it's overhyped over tiktok and instagram, some people are hating it because at first it will not really show on your skin, but pro tip you should use a dense blush on brush and it's going to be amazing. It's perfect for my medium-neutral Asian skintone :) * not my favorite blush but its cute and the i love the packaging. sad because the first shade i recieved was defective or something because the glue holding the pan to the container unstuck? the pan just flies and bounces around in there, but the second one i got didn't have the same problem. cute shades okay price * This is a good product for the skin, and it give a great glow. I bought cherry, and i thought it would be a big size but when it came in it was small. This made me think it was not worth the price, I would recommend this to a rich friend.

I use a liquid blush before than too it off with this one and it stays all day! Love love love * This is a beautiful blush. I bought Rosewood. * I was disappointed with this blush.

You won't need a replacement for a long time. It also won't break up on you when it gets low. Nars does that to me almost every time. I love this product. It actually saves you money and the colors are beautiful. Now lets hope they don't get greedy, change the formula and mess it up. * I have the newer formulation in ""Nude Look"", and I love it.  I love how buildable it is.  For no makeup, makeup days it's great because you can make it be more natural looking.  I read a bad review on this page and said it was patchy?  It's not patchy on me at all.  Maybe because of different make-up prep?  I love this blush and definitely would recommend.  Yes, it is pricey, but if you want to splurge on a good blush…. This would be a great option. * I hate blushes that are so pigmented or just don't blend well meaning they aren't natural but this is so cute! Sometimes when I want like a sunburnt look its super natural & when I put it on everyday its super lightweight and it doesnt smudge.

I've used products that cost half as much that felt more luxurious. Absolutely no color payoff and building it up makes it patchy beyond belief. This is going back tomorrow.

The shades have a pretty consistent formula and texture, which isnt always the case with liquid blush. I use shades pink and buffed peach as blush, and raspberry with a teeeny bit of a live tinted stick to contour. I have very fair skin (especially in the summer time) so i like to do contour with tones that are a bit more mauve. A painter once told me that face shadows are actually very blue and purple, and that stuck with me. I feel like a cool-toned dark purple is actually the best shade for me to use to contour versus something more brown. Buffed peach is very sheer, so i use a dot of it along with pink to help sheer it out and hydrate my skin. I set it with either rare beauty or nars blush and it lasts all day. I usually use a face oil and the youthforia primer to prime, fenty foundation, nars concealer, laura mercier setting powder, and urban decay setting spray. I'm a cheer/gymnastics coach and sometimes work 11-hour days in the summer heat, and this combo holds up well for that entire time. For reference, i use a generous dot of each and a real techniques brush to blend it all together. I apply powder blush on top of it to set it so it has more staying power. * Received a deluxe sample of Pink in my GWP. It's fantastic, better than other liquid blushes I have tried. When this sample is finished, I'll purchase a full size. It's richly pigmented, buildable, and natural looking. I can wear it without foundation. * I love this blush. I have been looking for a blush that goes on easy but looks amazing. it has a beautiful glow and the color is just enough. This is now my favorite. * I don't often write reviews but wanted to note that these are not a consistent formula across the color range. I've tried Coral, Pink, Buff, Berry, Raspberry and Strawberry. Strawberry is the one to especially avoid! It is sheer and doesn't glow like the other colors and maybe even wears away faster. The other colors have this great sheen with being shimmery. Coral, Pink and Buff are my favorite. If you like the glow wands but they're a little too shimmery for certain occasions you will love these! * As someone who has always struggled with applying blush on my face without looking like a clown, these are perfect. A tiny dot goes a long way and blends perfectly. * This was a gift"

Never thought I would ever be one to wear blush. * I own 3 different colors and am in love with every shade. The finish is a beautiful skin like satin, tons of lovely shades that work on all skintones, stunning packaging, wtc * I got the Fleurtasious (sp) it is a beautiful beige pink and i have fair skin and it blends beautifully. * The prettiest blush for every skin tone. A bit pricey but you do get a bit more product than you would with other highend blush at this price point.  Also, a little goes a long way because the pigment is definitely there and the texture and application is so smooth. Love this blush (shade cherish) * Description says Divine Rose is ""cool mauve"" but it's warm toned. The packaging is plastic with the kind of clasp you have to push in to release the lid. It's annoying and cheap. The formula is... Okay? It took several tries to find a brush that really worked for it. Nothing groundbreaking.  Not at all worth the high price."

I've used up Bare Back completely and still use the In the Nude shade. Bare back is a more subtle, muted cool/neutral color. I really like it all year round! In the Nude is more peachy and a little darker so I like it in the summer with a tan. Cherry Blossom Babe is my newest one and im obsessed. Its a true bubbkegum pink color - so girly and light! Its a brighter Barbie version of Bare Back in my opinion. * Love!"

Its talc free so it doesn't settle into fine lines. Im fair so i use the colors individually to set, highlight and bronze. Theyre also beautiful as eyeshadow. Because they're baked, they also last forever. With daily use, i hit pan every year or so. * Stunning glow. Not shiny or sparkly, subtle and beautiful. I sometimes swatch by single color and sometimes just swipe my brush across all 3, then sit back and wait for compliments. Great for understated am glow too. Lost a star bc price prohibitive. Should be an everyday glow product but isn't for me bc of the price. * I'm on the fence with this product. I really wanted to love it. I have to use full coverage foundation due to hyperpigmentation and dark spots. So when I used this, I used it instead of my setting powder/pressed powder. Didn't really like the way it looked on me. Maybe I'll try using my setting powder first then this. If that doesn't work, then I'm probably going to return it. It's nice but it's not WOW factor. * I've purchased things for $5 that had better pigment and quality. * To be honest I don't used and I don't like the highlight shade though I love Dim and Radiant light which come along in this palette they both fits my need  Using Natural hairs brush (Sonia G smooth buffer / buffer pro ) is the best result / thanks for letting me share * Honestly I don't care about finishing powder so I have never used any .. More than 5 years I saw many YouTuber reviews and told things about HG ambient lighting palette which makes me wonder and more eyeing to try ..

So easy to blend out and isn't too pigmented of a blush. Perfect for an everyday look if you're looking for a quick blush! * I was looking for a plum blush and this product is so easy to apply and the color is such a natural look. Do know, the product packaging is cheap. But the product is sublime it looks natural yet adds that enhancement, and there is a slight glow to it. I have found other blushes are really heavy. This one is definitely buildable.  This can go from a day to evening look very easily and the price point I think is good given the amount of product you get and the look that you get when using it. * I was so excited to see Pat McGrath at Ulta! I chose the color Fleurotique and it is my absolute new favorite. I've used it everyday since buying it. I don't wear full makeup & enjoy a natural makeup look & this product is perfect for that. Works well with a tinted moisturizer or a heavier foundation with more coverage. I'm really hoping that she follows this with a bronzer that is similar! 
I love that my face doesnt feel greasy with this product like I've experienced with other similar products. It glides on easily, is easy to blend, and the color builds beautifully. * This looks so pretty on the cheeks.  It's easy to blend and to work with.  Also the longevity is great too for such a dewy finish.  I will say the glossiness of the formula on the cheeks fades throughout the day becoming one with the skin so the color is still there just the more natural. * I have medium dark skin and have had a tough time finding a blush stick that actually shows up on my skin without looking too much.  I've tried so many brands. I just discovered this brand and am sold.  The color divine rose in particular is beautiful.  The pink shows through and imparts a glow just like the product name says.  My skin is also uneven in color now that i'm in my 50s and it looks good even without foundation.  I also purchased the color fleurotique and it's nice but not as natural looking as the rose color."

Intense coral leaves a beautiful and natural sunkissed flush to your cheeks, even without any makeup underneath. It was love at first sight within the very first time i tried it on."

It also is the longest lasting cream blush (over 8 hours) and i am very oily. * Love this product! Very easy to use. Also blends perfectly!🩷 * I have both audition and the chorus shade, both are described to be pink/rosy but are sooo orange! They still are great, they're easy to blend and long lasting on my oily skin! * Chorus girl is supposedly ""soft pink"" and appears pink in the pictures and the box. But it is 100% peach. Seriously, it's not pink at all! * I love everything about this cheek & lip stick. Hello pigmentation! A little goes a long way. But in a good way. Like you get the color and depth you want without trying to hard. * The shade ""audition"" is advertised as a ""nude pink"" - this is a WARM RED. Not a pink at all!!!! Wrong advertising. * I was looking for a balm that would work well on my cheeks and lips for the summer. I chose the strawberry color. It's definitely deeper than strawberry, but still pretty. It goes on smoothly on my lips and cheeks. Easy to spread for a flush of color. My provlem is that it has no longevity. It wears off very fast on my lips and doesnt last much longer on my cheeks. Combo skin, used setting spray. So pretty, i wish it had worked out"

Super creamy and easily blends. The case is cute and works great and the product lasts a long time even with daily use! * Love this hybrid gel cheek duo * I purchased the Grapefruit and Caramel color. I tried it out with my fingers and a brush.

The good;
-Pretty colors. They swatch mat but do blend out sheer and become part of the skin. 
-Elegant formulation with a creamy and light feel on the skin. 
-Easy to use, compact and portable.
-No discernable scent. 
-Neither the bronzer nor the blush have any glowy particles. 

The not so good;
-I am fair but cool toned and ALL the colors are warm on me. Why Stila, why? 
-Once applied the blush and bronzer become sheer and the colors disappear as they blend in. 
-I had to do multiple layers before I could truly see any color payoff.
I am tempted to purchase a darker color combination just so it would show up. 

Overall this is a clever, very convenient, and  portable product. Perhaps great for on the go touchups. But it is so sheer and blends out on my skin so much that there is virtually nothing left. * I really like this Stilla Blush & Bronze Hydro-Blur cheek duo. It blebds well and looks so natural. Its not sticky or tacky at all. It doesnt turn orange color either.  Doesnt look fake. * Based on the photos, I'd have shied away from the intense shades but they really sheer out on my light olive skin so I'm so glad I saw them in person because I would've ended up picking a lighter shade (and I might do that, too). Loving the Guava! It is lasting longer than powder blush (even with a setting spray) and is super convenient to throw into my bag for on the go touch ups. I even dabbed some of the bronzer side on in my crease when I was out and my eyeshadow needed a little pick me up. SOLD!!! * Not nearly as good as the Dibs beauty version. Didn't blend well and came off within an hour"

It's really creamy and easily blendable. * I love this product for someone with textured skin or large pores. It does not settle. I love the glowy, flushed from within, look it gives. Pairs beautifully with other liquids powders and creams. You really cant beat the price and performance. Highly reccomend the Morphe cream blush brush they sell with this. It is amazing for any cream cheek product. * Super great blush! Be careful! Pigmented and so creamy that I pushed down to hard and ruined the swirl! * Very hydrating and very pigmented.  I do not recommend for the ""oily girls"" because the product is VERY hydrating.  I definitely recommend for mature faces! * I love how pigmented and creamy it is. And the price. Loving all the colors too. * rlly like this blush its not greasy and i love the color i got , which is intoxicated * I love this product. I think it is going to last a long time! I use it over a cream to powder foundation and it works like a charm. However, it is very pigmented so be careful with your dips. Start light and build up."

I have super sensitive skin and this has no talc! Yay! * I was so glad that Bobbi Brown removed the lanolin from their blushes, but disappointed to see that they now contain coconut oil, which is pore clogging.  I know Bobbi Brown has dry skin, and I feel like all her products are made with dry skinned people in mind, but do not work well for people with oily or acne prone skin.  It's too bad, because I have had back luck with several of her products (her tinted moisturizer contains petrolatum, and clogged my pores).  Please make products that anyone can use! * I bought Desert Pink. It is a darker medium pink. The size was small and packaging seemed cheap. Would be good in a makeup kit because it's small, no bulk, and has a window to show color. It's buildable but the price is too much for what you get. When you pay this much for blush you expect a bit more. Pretty but the size and price are cons for me."

I'm  a medium brown skinned, 50 year old . These colors compliment me both ways * This is my 2nd time purchasing this palette & it's everything.  I especially like to blend the gold bronze and the pink bronze together. I use the morphe fan brush to apply and the rose colored highlighter brush to blend and it blends the highlighter and bronzer perfectly. Since I moved this product isn't sold in store so I had to order...that's the only thing that I don't like is that it's not sold in MN Ulta stores. * This palette is exactly what I was looking for, the colors are very pigmented, but it is a little hard to blend out well. The colors are fantastic; it has contour, blush, highlighter. Also, I use them as eye shadow. * This palette is horrible! The contour and highlighter do not blend easily at all. The highlighter has very chunky glitter. If I could give it no stars I would. * The blushes in this palette are soo pretty. The bronzers are warm and beautiful as well. Perfect for your kit. * This product is goood!!! I'm an MUA... and it's good for women of color * I have been looking for a bronzer for my deep complexion and wanted to try out a few shades before committing. This palette lets me do that. Both bronzers work nicely for me so I blend both. The contour is super pigmented so go in with a light hand. The matte blush shade is super pretty and I love the highlighters. Haven't tried the brightening powder yet. Would purchase again once I hit pan."

It may not be for everyone but I didn't have a problem with it since I do simple light makeup. * I bought this blush in shimmery rose. It has a pretty, subtle shimmer but is not super pigmented.

It was the most re-purchased product in my entire makeup bag, now I'm done.  The last one I purchased (post 'reformulation) is complete and utter garbage.  Nothing but a shimmer bomb mess with zero color payoff.  Horrible product!  In a time when so many companies are 100% in their blush game, NARS has done themselves in.  Buh-bye. * I liked this ar first, but with time I feel its hard for the brush to pickup the product and you hardly get any on your face. * I have been using Nars blush in orgasm for 15+ years. I recently received my new blush in the refillable packaging and it does NOT come out. Basically, NO product appears on my blush brush! Why change the formulation?!?!! Product deserves rating ZERO! * Orgasm 777 requires so much on the brush to show up on my face. (My skin tone is light to medium) For the cost, it's not pigmented enough. Like many others, I've been a longtime user of this beautiful blush in the color Orgasm. I've probably purchased 100 over the years and recommended it to everyone. I understand reformulating to remove talc (which never bothered me, btw) but WHY change the color and/or put so much shimmer that it takes WAY more to even show up on my face?
I need another blush. * I had the old formula in Orgasm and didn't like it; too dry. This new one is almost creamy and has much more pigment. I bought the shade Rush, which is perfect with my tan, a sort of cross between blush and bronzer. Overpriced so I can't give it a 5. * The new formula is talc free, but not nearly as pigmented. The swatch of Orgasm is super disappointing. Shimmery but extremely sheer. Orgasm X is now closer to the old original Orgasm. I'm so sad because I am almost out of Orgasm. I don't think I will be repurchasing. * This is a good product just not pigmented. Good shade range."

The bronzer is way more pigmented than expected-a little goes a long way.  Blush too but the overall end color is fab.  Highly recommend for a medium skin tone! * It's really hard to find warm leaning products that aren't too deep, but I found Italian summer is super flattering on my complexion. If you lean cool, this palette might not be the right one for you as it's very gold-based in person, more so than the online pictures. I dropped one star because there is glitter in the blush+highlighter. It blends in pretty well but would prefer more of a natural shimmer. Overall a great three in one palette for a minimalist like me. * Although my skin tone is on the lighter side, I opted for the Costa Rica palette because I preferred the blush color. The bronzer is thankfully not too dark for me and blends nicely. I'm not a fan of the highlighter color, though. It's way too bronzed. I have the ABH highlighter palette so I just use that, but I was trying to find an all-in-one face palette. I likely won't repurchase, but it is an ok palette if you like all the colors. * I love this palette. I have pale skin, so I bought Italian summer. Great pigments and great packaging. * You need this it's truly REMARKABLE ITS SO NICE MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR COLOR THOU.This will get you many to ask what you're wearing and where you get it.  The inside and out it's truly worth all the coins. I just hope it last so I'm able to get a medium one too. This is my go to and will be for a long time. Loving this. * The blush and bronzer are pretty, but the highlight is so powdery, it has not shine at all. Thinking about returning. * It's beyond a different shade in person then here. Beyond disappointed since most store aren't taking exchanges :("

This blush is FAR better for my coloring and for applying. * I like it but, I don't use it evry day and in 2 months the applicator sponge came off .... no longer useful. * This is great if youre in a pinch and need something. But you're definitely getting what you paid for. Youre almost better off with elf or paying full price of tarte. * Beautiful color. Doesn't enhance textured skin. Works perfectly over foundation and under powder. Applicator is genius and the price point is amazing! * I got the color Darling (bright red coral) and it blends seamlessly with a beauty blender/other sponge for a natural flushed look. The bottle comes with a mixing bead that agitates the product when you shake it so you do not have to worry about separation which occurs in these liquid products. I'd actually buy more of these if I didn't have too much blush already. Highly recommend to anyone who likes liquid blushes. * Y'all I LOVE this product. I'm very much in a flirty, light makeup era and this blush is the perfect product for me right now. It's super light and blendable (think Glossier cloud paint), but also builds in a really nice way. My go to look lately is a dab of this on the cheeks and a swipe of mascara and I'm off to the races! The perfect soft blendable liquid blush, I highly recommend!"

After purchasing this during one of the sales, I'll never go back. I have both Candy Clouds and Golden Hour. It is quite pigmented so a little will go a long way. The blush blends seamlessly and I will keep it in my make up collection. I highly recommend! * I have 2 of these and I live them. Super cute packaging, nice scent (chocolatey), blurring, and gorgeous shades. Candy clouds is my favorite shade and blush ever * Love everything I purchased * okay so i like this blush because the color is cute, its more of a natural finish and the packiging is just mwah but it is so hard to open (the bronzers are the same packigining but easy to open) and it has a not bad but not pleasent very strong smell to it.

P.S. the smell might be different from person to person because it didnt smell bad to me it was just very strong but my friend said she hated the smell of it and it was too strong. * i loved it!!"

I pair it with Rare Beauty 'Hope' liquid blush or wear it on its own.  I love that it has three shades to create a custom look on my cheeks, but when I need to move fast, I use all of them all at once for a pretty soft glow blush.  I view its small size as a complete bonus.  It's absolutely perfect. * I love this color! I had been wearing the color mocha from Chanel for years and years and out of nowhere they discontinued it and nobody knew why because it was such a unique color then I switched to our oasis also discontinued so I found this and I feel like it's very similar I'm just wondering if it's going to stay on and where as well as the other two did! I really hope this doesn't get discontinued. I'm gonna buy a few more and I wish it came in a larger size. I do not feel like the her eyeshadows wewr well even w primer so im crossing my fingers that the blush stays on better! * As a ND collector this one was a miss for me, although the mini pallet in this series was great. This pulled really orange on my fair cool pink undertone. I also found the size of it impractical for having 2 blushes and a highlighter in it. I knew it was mini and that wasn't the issue, I just think it could/should have been JUST blush and it would have been great. But that highlight mixed in wasn't it for me. * I was hoping for a cool toned blush, but this ended up being more of a soft warm clay color on me than the more pinky mauve it appears to be. It wasn't working for me. The highlighter was cute, but I didn't think that or the blush had the best staying power considering the price. They aren't that bad, but just not my style, so I returned this item. The mini eyeshadow palette is a keeper, though! * If you want a pretty blush with a sheen, this is a good option. Just be aware, if you want that pinker tone (esp for us paler types) this isn't that. It's more of a rusty red tone, with a light gold highlight. * very beautiful colors and both blush and highlighter have smooth application. my new favorite!"

No more messy powder blocks breaking all over my travel bags. Its clean, simple, small, and literally amazing. I am so happy the store representative recommended it to me! * Ive been using this without any foundation and it works wonderfully. Works with liquid foundation (not a fan of liquid doundation though). 
But ontop of my powdered foundation it becomes super cakey and its hard to blend. 
I love the hot pink color, and the fact its made from Too Faced founders. It also stays on for awhile. Wish it worked better when i put on powder foundation. * The reviews were so great for this blush, i had to try it…Shade paris on light/medium skin is sheer, the product does not glide onto the skin well, and the amount of product you get for $30 almost made me fall over. 

I tried it over and under Givenchy prisme libre setting powder to test the formula and i am just simply not impressed. 

Two stars, only because everyone else seems to like it on here * The blush goes on easily on clean skin. I put it directly on my cheekbones and into my temple. I've been using my fingertips to blend into my desired area. It is a little tricky because it is real easy to over blend and have uneven cheekbones. Other then that I really like the blush. Love the texture. I am going to try using a brush and see if that works better for blending. * I decided to order these after watching some swatch videos. I purchased Paris, Sydney and Palm Springs. I ended up returning Paris and kept Sydney and Palm Springs. They're very pigmented, easy to apply and the amount is controlled with a brush although fingers work just as well. The finish is a powdery matte and does not make foundation budge when applied. I will be repurchasing these when I run out. They're small and compact enough to bring anywhere! * I generally use a medium foundation and when i am tanner during the summer i end up in medium-tan or maybe a tan shade if i have the luxury of being out and about more than usual. Currently i am in medium and the Los Angeles color has this white cast, like putting flour on my face with the pink. Not my favorite. It does go on smooth. I will give the product that much. * Absolutely LOVE this blush stick. The color is pigmented without being overpowering, and it lasts well throughout the day. It sets quickly, so make sure you're ready to blend as soon as you apply"

Then tap it into your cheeks it looks so natural and stunning.

The color is gorgeous, but the functionality is horrible. * I received the Velvet Petal blush as a free gift from one of my Ulta purchases and I am genuinely obsessed. I had never heard of this brand before. I used it for the first time at my brothers wedding and the other bridesmaids were taking photos of the packaging. 
You have to use a light hand with it because it's a pressed powder. You can get good coverage. * I LOVE the product, perfect pink. And the packaging is perfect. * I bought cotton candy, and received barely rose as a GWP with my jane iredale order (which was awesome!!) Honestly, the two colors are the same shade and depth, the only difference is that cotton candy has shimmer while barely rose is matte.  They are both beautiful - So far I have only tried cotton candy on my cheeks, wow it had way more punch than I expected! That being said I also tried it over top of the Mist cream blush, which I really didn't need to do, however it gave my cheeks a beautiful glow but I did had to buff it out a bit with a clean face brush as I was on blush overload lol.  I wish there were more shade options, it seems like many are neutral soft pinks and jump to more intense deep shades, perhaps a medium mauve/berry tone would be awesome! * It is actually cool toned, which is nice.  It's a very subtle, buildable formula but it looked very natural. It wore well for the whole day. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another color if I saw one I liked. * I purchased this during the sale.  I'd heard good things about the brand and was looking forward to trying it.  The first one I received was not the color I ordered.  Before I realized that, I tried it on and loved the formula, but it didn't show up on my fair skin.  So I went to my local Ulta to exchange it and they told me they couldn't because it was an online only item.  So I went home and called Ulta and the very nice gentleman quickly sent a new one in the right color.  In the meantime, he sent me a label to send the wrong one back.  I went to print it out and my brand new printer won't print it so I have to figure that out to get it back to them.  I have now received the new one in the right color.  I opened it to try it and I must have tipped it as I was holding it as the entire pan of powder fell out into my sink and broke apart.  As I tried to pick the pieces up, it broke into more pieces.  I've put what I could back into the pan and pushed it together, but as you can imagine, it's a mess.  I was so upset I didn't even try to put any on.  I don't even know if I'll be able to make it work.  Wish I could tell you more, but as you can tell, it's not been a positive experience. * I purchased this during the sale and I'm so surprised this was the last one to sell out or didn't sell out at all! This is the shade I planned to get before the sale started and I thought it would sell out quickly because of the pink blush trend. The photos do not do this blush justice! This is a neutral almost dusty pink that looks so glossy and shiny on the cheeks, without visible glitter or sparkles, at least to my eye. I've seen other reviews stating that there is glitter, but I don't see it. It just looks like your cheeks are glowing. 
It's such a gorgeous shade and finish for spring and summer. When I opened the compact, I gasped at how pretty this is and I never do that."

Id like to point out i never miss a day without makeup so i personally think you are getting your moneys worth and the highlighter will have you poppin and you will be that girl. Dont say i didnt put yall on 🤭 * Im obsessed with this palette. I have light to medium fair skin and it's beautiful I feel like its shimmer not glittery. Just bought a second one incase they run out * I'm obsessed with this palette so much I'm sad it's stars arebt higher. lol It gives you that perfect I spent all day at the beach look. * I have been on a quest to replace my 4 year old cheek palette from Tarte, and this ain't it. The colors don't apply evenly and there is way too much glitter in the blush and highlighter. I returned it and will continue to scrape the pans of my old palette until i find a suitable replacement. * The blush is show stopping. I get stopped all the time when i wear it. So confused why the reviews are bad bc this palette is gorgeous. the highlighter is pretty, and the bronzer is quite pigmented. Nothing too special- the blush is def a game changer tho. * I really wanted a cheek palette to cut down on clutter in my makeup bag. I was sorely disappointed to learn this wasn't it. The highlighter is just glitter. Way too coarse of a glitter than I prefer for a highlight. It looks nice as a shadow. The blush is more of a highlight, it's very iridescent. I learned that I prefer matte blush after using this. The bronzer warmed up my light complexion nicely but it does not make a good contour color; I use it more for a sun kissed glow. There is a lot of fall out from this palette.  It is usable but not as I intended it. * This is so easy to use and looks absolutely stunning on. Make sure to use the tarte brush with it for application. It blends it well. I have worn on top of foundation and on a clean face, works both ways!"

Great purchase. * The blush has beautiful colors, the staying power is good and it blends really well. However after having it for a day, when i opened it to apply, the entire stick of product fell out. If im paying this amount of money for a blush, the pakcaging should be secure enough to prevent the makeup from falling out * the perfect color!!! the bright pink one is amazing and pairs so well w winter kissed. such a unique texture * I was so hesitant to try out a cream formula blush but after swatching play for keeps I just HAD to get it and I loved it! The color is beautiful on my skin, can easily blend , and is pigmented. I went back and got breakfast in bed.. 10/10! * Obsessed * So it's wonky chocolate in a blush so good it taste like bleach and dishwasher soap so goooood

I like using a cream blush underneath and then one of these on top to set it. You can't beat the price and the quality is very good. * I wish they would make more all-in-one palettes like this. It is good quality, and flattering shades. Please make more! * The bronzer made me look orange and the eyeshadow falls off of my face, same with the sparkles from the sparkly blush but the highlighter is amazing and the blush is very pigmented. * I thought this would be a fairly large sized face palette, but its tiny! Its like a mini face palette. This is what makes it great for travel, which is how I'll probably use it. 

The eyeshadow colors are flattering peachy-pink-terracotta shades, very pretty for summer. The texture is lovely and easy to blend. The slightly larger blush, highlight and bronzer are good quality and fairly pigmented as well. * I've tried a couple of milani products and liked them, good quality for the price point. This is a very nice palette and feel the name suits it, i think this would look great on a variety of skin tones. It's very pigmented! I wasn't expecting that. Really love all the shades, they aren't too warm which i like, I have lighter medium skin tone and they look great. I love how small it is too, great for traveling and has everything to get a nice makeup look on the go. * this is the best purchase I have made. it easy to take on the go. I use it as I do my makeup on the train to work. the powders are easy to blend but pigmentes. they are not fussy at all. they never look dry or patchy. the colors work perfectly together and it has a great big mirror. i recommend it to absolutely everyone. I wish I could give it a 10/5 * I really love the bronzer and blush, but the eyeshadow has no pigment and everything has a lot of fallout. When I do my makeup, i sometimes have to wipe down my vanity because of all the fallout"

I love, love, love it!! * 1* for Ulta
5* for Morphe

I'm tired of always having my shade range available online only. Beautiful palette, bold colors, and deep enough for the darkest skin tones. 

I just hate the fact that I have to wait days in order to get my shade most of the time. In addition to me having to purchase multiple shades in order to find my exact one. 

This is so frustrating and I hope Ulta stops this practice. * I love the colors and tones it gives my face. It takes the guess work out"

However, it has a really pretty color also gives you a clean look. * I bought the original benetint color and by far.... have mixed feelings about the product. This is my first water tint and when I first used it, I didn't expect it to actually have the consistency of water lol. That's fine. I've used it for a month or so now and I wouldn't say it's my favorite. It gives a light pigmented look on the lips after a couple applications but because it's water-based, the stain doesn't really last long. I've only used it on my lips but I will probably only use it as a backup blush after this experience. * I got this when it was most popular it good I guess but it leaves your skin and doesn't show up after 1 millisecond it not worth it considering the price I love benefit but this was just not it if you like it and read this review look up eccesents what a tint lip and cheak tint it will save you 20 dollars 😊 * Its so good * Color doesnt last
But still ok * It just last a while and goves you that sunkissed look * Same great benatint but I don't love the brush applicator. I miss the doe foot features in the smaller size and although this is a great deal I'm not overly fond of the brush so I would not recommend this product.  It's not even a good brush. Does not apply well to cheeks. Just buy the regular size and get the far superior applicator."

Usually terracotta works best for me but this is unique.  I think soft brick may be close.  It's more neutral than it looks. 
Blends easily with brush or sponge. Apply and look like a goddess. * Color: warm rosebud pink

Okay so I saw how this looked in the photos on the model and I had to try it. I am fair skinned and I love it! I am a blush girlie so this is great for me. I look sickly without blush. 

It applies very easily. The only thing I will say is sometimes all I want to wear is blush and in that instance I dont think it stays put as well/as long. I try to pair it with a little primer or a tiny bit of foundation and thats the perfect light every day look im going for. * This products spreads easily with brush or fingers and isnt patchy. It goes over foundation and powder without lifting and looks juicy at first but drys quickly.
It is just too pigmented for me and im darker than medium right now. So unless your are a clown or very dark complexion. 

A big annoyance is the very tiny amount of product much like some of her other products. I gave it 2 stars due to this. * While it was small and pricey its the perfect item for your makeup look. Defintly worth the price."

This product was a good buy.  You can build it up to your liking, and it's very forgiving - just blend it out.

I imagine if you take good care of yourself and hydrate, the sky is the limit as far as how beautiful it looks on the skin.  

The blushes are not heavily pigmented, but are still lovely.  If I need a little extra, Tower 20 or Natasha Denona blushes work well. * wanted to love this palette. the colors are beautiful but there's too much glitter and not pigmented enough. doesn't last. * Terrific cream bronzers and blushes!!

The top is a buildable shimmery eyeshadow, the second layer works as a bronzer/blush combo on my fair skin, the lip balm adds a faint swipe of color, and the highlighter is nice. * So I got the Oh so Nudie stack on sale one day and gave it a shot even though I'm not a morphe fan. This killed it. The eyeshadow is especially good and super flashy and looks really pigmented when applied correctly. The blush is flattering for my tanner skin tone it's like the perfect blush and bronzer mix. But my fav is the face highlight balm, it's the best highlight ever. It's so flattering and real looking. No powder glitter or pigments that look good in one angle and terrible in the other. This is just a clear balm that doesn't rub in and disappear like others I have tried like this. It looks really good on their hint hint skin tint which I'm loving as well and use every day since it is the perfect oil free which is a must yet glowy foundation tint. Morphe2 is definitely doing it for me which is nice to find out because now that I see these other stacks I kind of need them... * I love the stacking idea but I'm can't decide if I love the product or not. I have the ""Violet Vibes"" version. The top layer is a very light pink eyeshadow with sparkles. it feels a bit chalky but it's alright. The second is a sparkly blush, again, a bit chalky and I don't love that it's sparkly but it's alright. The third layer is a berry colored lip product with a slightly sticky chapstick type consistency, which is nice but difficult and messy to apply without an applicator. The final one is almost like a glitter balm with chunky glitters. Definitely a bit of an oddball choice but can be fun on certain occasions. I would probably recommend this to a friend but the bottom two are a bit inconvenient and I do wish the powders were more buttery and high-quality feeling. * Wanted to love this. It's compact for travel, that's about all the props I can give it. It's cheaply made and should be sold as makeup for little girls to play in. Not impressed at all. Will be returning it . * The colors are perfect and exactly what I wanted, a warm yellow tan but the problems are the lip gloss tastes terrible like perfume and the eyeshadow irritated my eyes as soon as I put it on. I'm pretty sure a lot of that was because of the glitter fall out. I do have sensitive eyes so who knows. The gloss smells nice but doesn't taste nice unfortunately. There's pretty much no color which could be overlooked if it tasted better and was moisturizing. The blush is pretty sheer which I prefer a buildable blush so that's ok and the highlight is sheer with no color to it which is also ok because it looks more natural. All in all I would not repurchase this and have no desire to try other colors. * I've bought around 3 of these because I truly love the product in itself. It's convenient, pretty, and easy to use especially when it's a quick day or I'm travelling with it. the only big downside from me that's disappointing is the top glitter keeps breaking and falling out, in which glitter then gets everywhere. It's again a nice product besides that and it's making me hesitant to buy again as I'd like to not have to clean up a glitter mess for once * I've wanted to try this ever since it came out, and finally had a chance to pick one up in the Fresh Peach shade. This is such a lovely product. My favorite is suprisingly the lip balm, its so hydrating with a nice wash of color, and lasts super long, even with drinking. I was a bit sad that the blush is a powder, not cream, but its still beautiful. 

The only negative is I wish the eyeshadow shade was a bit less full glitter, and more of a shimmer. Its hard to use solely on the eyes due to that, and otherwise this stack would make a perfect all in one travel product. It works great on top of eyeshadow sticks though!"

Im no stranger to cream products, however. I trally, really like these! The colors look great on my skin tone, which is somewhere around ""medium"". I find the best way to apply these products is by rubbing a makeup brush right over the top of the product, rather than applying directly to my face. The colors and finish is so pretty. Its natural looking, yet not so much that it just blends away. Seems to last a relatively long time, as well. I will definitely be purchasing more from this brand. * Love these easy to blend colors! On our vacation, these made getting ready super easy. The colors are really pretty too. Will buy again! * Color applies smoothly however the color tube is sliding off the tube, it can break so I have to be careful when I open each tube and apply it. * Light color and glossy * I use these daily for a no makeup look with a tinted moisturizer.

Application is great too * I decided j wanted to try a blish stick instead of powder so I chose this one and im so glad i did! Ive had this blush for about a year now and i still have plenty left! I would definitely recommend! * I have oily skin…really oily, so I wasn't really expecting it to last all day.  I was surprised!  I put it on, great blendability, perfect amount of pigment, and the color, ""juicy melons"" is stunning…. But I went on a hike that day and walked around in the sun, and when I got home it still looked great.  Awesome blush.  Definitely going to pick up more shades and I definitely recommend to anyone. * I am an avid cream blush user and have tried many different brands. I decided to give this a try after hearing a lot of good things about them, but I unfortunately did not like it. The longetivity isn't the best, even for being matte - the minute you rub your face it's gone (even when I set with powder blush on top). It's unfortunate because I loved the natural color it gives and that it's buildable, but I can't justify the price for the lack of lasting power. Maybe if you like to wear very light makeup and don't care for your blush not lasting long would I get this (even then there's better for less $$$, such as the elf putty blush) * I bought this during the 21 Day promotion.  I wanted to try but a bit pricey but on sale i will try.  I was skeptical but I will say I love this product.  Im older with typical challenges we older girls face.  This product goes on smooth. Blemds beautifully and lasts all day.  I love it.  Really great product. * I was so excited go try this when i saw influencers using it so i immediately purchased during the 50% off sale. The packaging and brush tip is cute but its almost impossible to get the blush to blend out and i feel like it could easily mess with whatever makeup you have on underneath. The mirror also came cracked. Other blushes are cheaper and more blendable with better color pay off, i returned and bought a rare beauty blush instead and i'm much happier * A must-have in your beauty arsenal. The color pay-off is intense so you don't need to use a lot. It does what you want. A hint of summer color? Then, use a little and keep it sheer. If you prefer a more opaque sweep of color, then use more. Nudestix and Tower 28 are my fav blushes. Bye-bye powders."

This another disappointment in recent years with changing once elegant classy formulas and packaging to cheap glitter makeup with flimsy packaging. I was hopeful the color mist would be a replacement for my beloved in touch cream blush in clarity but no way!!! This reminds me of something I would see in my 3 year old daughters play makeup kit. The glitter in this is beyond overwhelming and actually makes skin look drier. Please bring back in touch cream blush . I think it might be time to move on and find a new makeup brand for my needs. * Disappointed, too much gliter and doesn't blend well. * I got Glorious and am relatively fair, and I love it. It doesn't last super long, but it's easy to re-apply. I like to put it on even when I don't have other makeup on (like when I just woke up or go for a walk or whatever) for just a natural slightly flushed look. I was worried it would be too dark or too glittery for me, but it's not. Love it!"

But if you want more vibrant and just smoth blushes then maybe save uour money and buy a better pallatte but if your trying yo save a coin and just want multiple blushes that arent bad then go ahead * Pros:
Great variety of blush shades, all in wearable colors.
Great for fair to medium skin tones (neutral/olive/warm undertones mostly)

Cons:
The wear time is average.
This palette def wont work for deep/deepest skin tones.
May not be flattering on cool tone skin. * Affordable and beautiful * love love love the dofferent shades of colors, plus very essy to apply * Really love this blush set! I am a fair skin woman so I am not sure if it would be as pigmented for my darker complexion pals but if you are fair skin it works well. Blushes are blendable and enjoy that I am able to switch my blush around each day. * If your lookihg for a budget friendly blush palette this one is the one you should get! I got it out of curiosity and wanting many different blushes without having to indivually buy a bunch, and this was a great choice! Pigment is great and I am in love with it!"

Such a waste of a product * I was so sad when Too Faced discontinued ""your love is king"" and I finally discovered ""Mauvilous"" is nearly identical! It's a very bright purple-toned pink. Very pigmented and can be a little tricky to blend without foundation, but brushing over it with a little translucent powder helps. * This blush is so pigmented. Its not a cream blush but it has almost like a buttery feeling almost like physcians formula products?? It may be a little pricey but for the amount of product your getting i think its valued at a right price. * This product is applied really good on the skin yet is very very pigmented it gives a soft look and it's very smooth too.

The colora are cute but the blush is sheer and applies patchy. It disrupts most foundations underneath. I took these on vacation and ended up buying something else because these don't last on me at all. * I bought this in store last night. Typically I use the Clinique Cheek Pop in Pansy. I'm running out and didn't want to spend the money for another so, I came across Cheek Freak Blush Balm in the color Score. Better price point for me right now. When I opened the case, I was a little concerned about the color but, once on and built up a little (I'm more tan than normal right now because of summer) it was the exact color. I love that it is cream (I have aging skin) and it blends really well. I used my fingers to apply and blend. I would recommend and I will be trying additional products. * I love this blush. I'm a makeup newbie and I found this very buildable and easy to use, while still pigmented enough that you don't need much product. The cream to powder formula sits nicely on the skin and lasts me 8+ hours even without setting spray or powders on top. * Awesome blush! Natural or can be easily built on for a more dramatic look! Does great especially for the price! * Buildable and blendable! Love this clean blush! Long lasting, great pigment that doesnt look overdone! * i got the shade smash, and i absolutely love it. it can be subtle but its also easy to build if you want an intense look. i also like this product because i have sensory issues and cant stand powder , but oily skin so cream just slips right off. this is a good in between. feels like a cream but finishs like a very soft very fine powder. idk how to explain it but i love it. also, the shade is gorgus. tip: to find the perfect natural shade for you, squeeze the tip of ur finger and try to match that shade. * Picked ""Shagged"" and it's way more pink/neon on me than I wanted. I really didn't care for it and would have returned it had I not destroyed the box it came in.

No detectable glitter just the most beautiful sheen that brings your cheeks back to life! This formula does not dry down however, they do become less sticky but doesn't dry down completely.  Therefore, I would not consider these long wearing but that isn't in the claims either. As someone with dry skin, these are stunning and everything I want, and doesn't emphasize texture. I heard these are a dupe for the makeup by Mario plumping cheek blushes and I can totally see that being the case but I do not own those. * Such a creamy blush with good pigment. It is now one of my staple blushes. Good for those who like to look glowy. Last me all day * I have fair, mature skin. I purchased Garden Party. I applied after foundation and powder. I love the color, although it did pull a little more peachy on me. Applies more sheer but is easily buildable. And the sheen it gives is beautiful. Not shimmery, just glowing. The finish reminds of the Makeup by Mario soft pop plumping blush veil. Love this blush, highly recommend!! * I bought multiple shades of this blush while it was on sale and the colors are so beautiful! The darker shades seem scary but I'm telling you they blend so well and give the look of 'old money'. I have very fair cool toned skin and have tried so many other brands of blush. This is the most user friendly, not too glowy formula I've tried. Powder sits well on top. Worth the try! * Very pretty and very pigmented. * I got the Flamingo color and it is AMAZING on my cheeks.

I'm obsessed with this formula! I have aging, combo-oily skin and these stay ALL day. I use a smaller, less dense brush to stipple on my cheeks/temples/nose and it's perfection. I wish more people talked about this product because it deserves it! * This product is very lightweight and sheer which is perfect for summer months where you don't want a full face of makeup. Also the colors are nice (bought peach and cherry).

However, it instantly dries once it hits your face so you need to QUICK so that you aren't left with a streak of unblended color. Its hard to blend out and working to get it to blend moves any makeup that was underneath before application. It also looks patchy on the skin due to difficulty blending. * I've been eyeing this product for a while and decided to try Cherry as an affordable option to the red blush trend. This is STUNNING. Definitely best blended with your fingers right after application before it sets. Dewy and natural and effortless! * I bought this blush as a dupe for the you know what, and i ended up really enjoying this in my routine. The shade is very pretty and it feels so nice and cooling on your skin. Its just a little to blend. * This is a really pretty stain for lips and cheeks! I love the different shades. The price point is decent. I'd say this is a milk dupe but I think undone came out with this first! * OMG I love this blush! It's so buildable and it feels cool on your skin.

I have used this as a regular blush, which gives a soft glow all over the cheeks and as as highlighter over different blush. if using as a highlighter, it does have a pink under tone, so I had to blend it a little with the blush I did use and it looked so good still! this was my first iconic London item I've ever tried, and I'm now obsessed and am going to have to try more products from them! * Love how it looks on my skin. * Easy to blend and a good shade that works well on medium skintones without feeling heavy or overly saturated * Love the tanny glow on my fair skin.

I love the consistency of this product - it's thinner than a cream but thicker than water. I just use my fingers to gently dab on my cheeks. It blends well and looks natural. I do layer it on top of my foundation - maybe if you're dabbing your whole face and then blending it might dry and be difficult to blend out, but I haven't had any issues the way I use it. The color is not thick so it looks very natural. This is my favorite new blush. * I loved the color but sadly I had to return it because it was patchy. No matter if it was on bare skin or with skin tint * Loved it but you just need so much product ao not worth the cost * No 5 star due to application.  Too much always comes out. * Love the flexibility of cream blush. I prefer a subtle tone, so a little of this works perfectly. Melts into my skin and looks natural. NOTE: I bought Provence shade, not Mistral. * Got the blush in the color Provence and it's a beautiful soft nude pink shade. I was eyeing this blush for months but when I couldn't find a similar liquid blush shade to this, I decided to bite the bullet and get it despite reading mixed reviews about this formula. I tried so hard to make this work since the shade is everything I was looking for but it was patchy, splotchy, and hard to blend out. I tried it with a brush, sponge, and my fingers but once it made contact with the skin, it was hard to blend out. The only way I got it to work was if I mixed the blush with another medium like liquid foundation. I held onto it for a few weeks but it wasn't worth the hassle so I returned it unfortunately. * I got a sample of Provence as a GWP and when i first opened it i thought the color definitely would not work on my medium neutral asian skin. It appeared pale and at first i couldnt really see it on my skin so i applied a second layer which was VERY PATCHY just ribbing with my finger tips. I let it dry for a moment and moved the product around again on my bare skin with my fingertips and it gave a beautiful natural flush with a dewiness that looked like my natural skin! It wore well over hours. I was surpised i liked such a light pink and how the formula melted into my skin. Not sure how this will work over makeup, perhaps over a skin tint would be okay but for natural days with just sunscreen on this is nice but the patchiness makes it so the product takes longer to apply well. I think the trick is to wait for it to dry down before blending."

Its a perfect size too so they dont dry out and i can use them fully. * You can easily build up the products depending on what kind of look you're going for, and they blend so smoothly onto skin with fingertips or a sponge! I use this after prepping skin with DIME tinted sunscreen. The highlight blends best with fingertips as it is a little dark, so warm fingers disperse the glow a little better! This is a wonderful set for someone getting into more natural & simple glowwy makeup :) * I ordered this little kit for my daughter actually. She is a toddler in her first year of dance and it is recommended they have sole makeup for recital. I was looking for something natural and light that I would feel comfortable putting on her little face and that I could apply with minimal mess if she can't sit still. When this arrived we tried it out immediately and it is absolutely perfect! The texture is nice, the color is lovely, and it stayed on while she was playing and being wild. I have no doubts it will stay put and look lovely for her recitals. She did fight me a little bit in the test run but she was more receptive of this than the hair brush so I'd say it's not too bad if you have a toddler ballerina too. I was so pleased with the packaging and quality and just everything that I'm looking at the Nudestix items I might want for my makeup bag since I rarely do my makeup anymore since having my kiddo.

It blends so well and love that is has shea butter in it. I also have very sensitive skin and this works wonders. * First of all, the finish is beautiful. I was a bit nervous at first because it does seem that there are some really ultra fine bits of glitter in this. I actually don't mind glitter so much, but this just wasn't my goal when I was buying the product. However, when actually applied it just looks very radiant and luminous in a natural way. Like in a celeb way where they seem to glow from within and have no worry in the world lol. And it's not in a greasy way or an oily way that many cream, liquid, and balm blushes are. 

Honestly, I would be keeping this if it just suited my skin tone. This is the second to last darkest shade, and it's the only blush dark enough in the selection that has a rosy tone. The darkest shade seems more like a bronzer imo. This product applies very sheer and the product isn't as burnt red-y purple as in the photo. It's more of a pink. It's not really buildable either. The swatch coverage shown is misleading. I don't necessarily need another pink shade that washes me out in my collection. I have enough of that unfortunately. It seems that these brands never really think about black skin when making these shades, not do they think about the performance on melanated skin. It's honestly very exhausting. If you are any darker than Zoe Kravitz, maybe leave this one on the shelf. Or use it as a bronzer topper. When will POC actually get shades that suit us? I'm so tired of spending money on things that just don't seem to work for me :( * I am a Danessa Myricks super fan. I love so many of her products especially the cream blushers. So naturally, I excitedly bought her lowlighters - terrible on me. So I took a chance in the ELF blushes - the absolute bomb!!! Want them to make a million more colors. Fab prod, terrific price! * The products applies fairly smooth. * I dont know why it took me this long to finally try this blush but OMG. The formula is amazing and I feel like it looks as good as my high end blushes. It has a great staying powder, mind you I have dry skin. It is almost as good as the new liquid blushes. It tends to get a little bit dry after a while but even my expensive cream blushes do, you just need to warm it up a little bit with your finger and your good to go. 
I got the shade Maui because I'm so into mauve blush and this was perfect!! * I mixed Maui and Bermuda and it looked so beautiful and Dewey! It gave a perfect sun kissed look. Hope they continue this line! * I love cream blushes. They stay on my skin longer and blend better, however I'm not a fan of this blush. I can't tell if it's the product or if I got the wrong color."

It does dry down fast, so you have to work with the product quickly. My complaint is the size of the product. It's pricey for the amount you actually get. The tube is small and it's not even filled all the way with product. * Love it 😍 * I am so glad I found this after a long time gel blush product from another company was discontinued. This is a tint that is buildable and it looks like naturally flushed cheeks, which is exactly what I was looking for! * This is the world's best blush, in my opinion. A little goes a long way, the color is beautiful, it looks natural, and it stays on all day. You can't beat this gel blush for staying power and a natural look. * I just started using this blush and love it. It has a sheer and natural color to it and feels very moisturizing. Once absorbed the finish is dewy and light. My favorite thing about it is it doesn't pronounce the texture and pores in my skin and gives me a smooth look. I highly recommend it! * It looks intimidating on the sponge but trust me: it blends out easily,  sheer, and leaves a beautiful, natural flush of color that lasts all day. A co-worker actually asked what I'd been up to the night before the first time I wore it, if you know what I mean! ;-) * This blush blends into a beautiful, sheer flush of color. It looks natural, wakes up my face and gives me a glow. I hope they don't discontinue this product."

It's so easy to use and it is beautiful ❤️ Give it a try if you're on the fence, it's worth the $$$ ❤️ * I love makeup but lately I've been on the hunt for unique makeup. I bought this blush and the highlighter and not only do I love the quality, and creamy application of this makeup but I love the design and container even more. its the perfect shade for me and it looks more pigmented then it actually is which i like about this product. you want blush to look Natural and blend and melt into your skin tone not stand out or pop out where it becomes obvious your wearing a blush. I love the ascetic of this product. if I had to mention a con I'd say it's a bit bulky if you were to store this in a small cosmetic bag, but who wants to store this away! this makeup deserves to be displayed on a counter or shelf. it's so beautiful 😍 * It's not that good. you really need alot to work it in and it stick to one spot sometimes when applied. * In Tea Rose, this is the perfect blush. It goes on well w a blender, I pat this product on, not smear. The color is natural and it goes on like a charm. I will try other blushes, but they are too wet or the wrong color, so I keep coming back. I'm in my fifties and this one is the best creme blush I've ever tried, hands down."

My current favorite blush. * Literally NO pigment and made my base cake/oxidize immediately. It was like rubbing a grease stick on my skin. Even on it's own as a dewy look, still does not show up. Also not brown and black friendly in the slightest due to the drop of pigment added. I have a medium olive tone and I used the most vibrant shade, it  did not show up. Don't waste your money, Get Pixi for that price! * Its not pigment the most but its creamy and really blendable. I really like it * Its such a cute blush with good pigment and even some shimmer so it also serves as highlighter. But it doesnt last that long and you'll probably have to reapply * if you've seen the pixi on-the-glow blushes and have been considering buying them, DON'T. buy these instead. not only are they cheaper, but they're better quality. there's also more shade ranges for this product. i have 3 shades: blackberry crush, citrus crush, and raspberry crush. all of them are so beautiful especially in the summer. they are super easy to apply and blend as well as being long lasting through the entire day. i will say that i use this multi-stick more often as a blush, but that's because i have so many different lip products to use. drew barrymore really slayed with this one. * I was so sad this didnt work. I used Strawberry on top of the Colourpop pretty fresh foundation and it didnt show up at all. For reference, I'm between 10-30 fair neutral in that foundation. Im pale! It seemed more like a gloss woth a HINT of a color. I was so excited for this and it failed in my eyes. :( * This is my absolute favorite! It's got a glow to it, not as in mica but just a dewy glow that looks so ethereal. So easy to blend and it gives you a lot of control over the amount. I don't like blushes normally because either I over apply it or it disappears, this lasts a long time and doesn't look harsh. I'm very pale and the peach color looks like a natural blush! Not sticky, I like to rub my fingers on the stick then apply by tapping! Definitely gonna pickup more!"

I am definitely buying this again!🥰 * I solely bought this blush because i saw how cute the strawberries were, well they don't stay on! They're just like powder stamped strawberries and the moment you swipe with your brush, they will come off. The color is very pretty but it doesnt last on the skin. I could barely tell at the end of the day that i had any blush on. The formula itself seemed a bit chalky and it took a couple swipes to get the blush to build up. It smells like fresh strawberries, but what good is for the product to smell good if it doesn't perform as it should? Too bad i threw away the box it came in, or i would return it. Not worth the price tag in my opinion. * The scent is too sweet for me, but the color is nice and the texture of it is too. * the scent is very sweet and it leaves a nice pink on your cheeks as well * The smell is absolutely addicting lol. The strawberries sadly do not stay past the first layer but it still gives a pretty color on the cheeks.

I will say though that the color I picked (Rosalia) is a bit too purplish for me but I couldn't see any of the colors when I picked so it is what it is! Now it's definitely pigment-rich and I love that it's buildable and has a glowy finish! I am a fan just not a big fan of this color but I will be trying others soon!
#complimentary * This is a gorgeous pigmented highlighter. It's essentially a blush lighter that doesn't enhance texture. I really this is a beautiful finished however there is glitter in it * I love this liquid blush and glow . It gives you a natural glow its easy to blend . It's also pigmented too so a little goes a long way . The packing is nice you can easily take it anywhere if you need to travel . This was gifted to me . * I really like this creamy blush, the color I got goes perfect with my skin to give the little tan glow. Has the right amount of pigmentation and shine to blend very nicely. * Perfect blush * The Milani cheek kiss is nice. It blends easy. The pigment is very subtle, and pretty. Not sure if it is buildable. Color looms orange in rje tube but, gives a nice peachy, sunkissed glow."

The blush blends like a dream and the highlighter is unbelievable. It blends so easily with just a few taps from my finger. I cannot say enough about these two. Love. The powder highlighter is pretty and I do like it, but when you pair it with the two creams, it really isn't anything special. I wish it had been another cream. Another highlighter color or blush color in the cream formula would have been amazing. That's why I have 4 stars and not 5. Still fully worth the price tag for the two products though. * I'm not sure why the reviews are so great for this pallette. first of all, it arrived broken and second I'm pretty fair to medium skin and I have to put several coats of this on and it's hardly noticeable. In my opinion, definitely not worth the price. Highly disappointed. * I love this palette! The blush is agreat color and the cream highlighter is my favorite highlighter of all time. I use the powder highlighter as more of a highlight eyeshadow. I only wish the blush was a cream formula like the middle highlighter. * This texture is stunning. These formulas glide beautifully, no streakiness, perfect tones, and the texture is stunning. Believe the hype. Natasha's makeup is QUALITY. Worth every dime! * The interplay between color and texture in this palette is genius. I cant remember yhr kast time i felt so oretty, as i did when i wore this.

After I tried it I applied more because even though I extremely fair toned it did not show up at all and disappeared. I'm disappointed to say the least. * I like the versatility of this. * To be quite honest, I'm not sure what other reviews are talking about when they say this product has hardly any pigment because it is EXTREMELY pigmented. A little bit goes a very long way, I can use a pin head sized amount my entire cheek and then some. It's super easy to blend out, and while it is pigmented, it's also easy to build up. Perhaps lighter shades might be more difficult to work with (I used the shade Fuschia Passion) but I love this blush. Doesn't have a super dewy finish, but adds a nice flushed glow to a dewy look. * This cheek tint is super cute, and I love the dewy look it leaves on my face for a more natural appearance. It blends well, it gives nice color, and is gorgeous really. It's lightweight and perfect for a gently flushed look. The product could easily be buildable for more color too, depending on what you're going for. The only reason why I didn't give this five stars is because there's barely any product in the tube! I've used this maybe about 5 times and I already have to squeeze to get more product out. Good thing it's affordable but they should actually fill the tube to fit the size.

Personally, I never liked the Super Shock formula because I prefer using brushes when doing my makeup, and none of my brushes can pick up this formula, leaving me to do it with my fingers. Okay, whatever. I can get over that. But the biggest problem that I have with this highlighter is that it is mostly GLITTER. I love a glitter highlighter now and then, but not when using an everyday palette for an everyday look. It looks so weird to have matte bronzer and blush, and then a stripe of glitter on my cheekbones. It would be fine if the highlighter was a cute shimmery color, like Lunch Money, but it's very glittery which sucks. Tbh, I bought a cheap Essence highlighter so that I could crush up the ColourPop one and transfer the Essence one into the compact so that I can actually have an all in one palette. Oh well.

However, the packaging is a bit of a miss too. Aesthetically, it looks great, but mine no longer clasps shut even though I haven't done anything like drop it. So it's probably not a great option for traveling anymore, which was why I wanted it… lol * One of my go to palletes, especially for the blush!! I like to mix the bottom two. The pigment is just right and very buildable. Could be used for natural or full glam :) * I first purchased for the blush but ended up using all four! I love this and it's a great all in one palette! * Love the palette. Pretty. * Blends seamlessly and amazing for travel * I gave this pallete a 3 to be generous. There are two blushes, which I like, but the blush and bronzer do not stay at all! The highlighter stays, but it's very faint on the face. My pallete at least had a problem where it wouldn't stay closed, and the pans are too small. * Love the palette ! I wish the highlighter had bigger chunks of glitter. That's all!"

Everytime I have purchased this product the container falls apart so easily. It fails to protect the powder causing it to eventually crumble apart. I continue to purchase it because I absolutley love it but I wish colourpop would read all their reviews regarding the poor container packaging and create something more durable so that the powder will not shatter. * I had really liked using this product and didnt have much left of it, so I ordered another. The colors are pigmented well, for me anyway. And it is easy to use. I like that it had the four shades all together in one. 
The one I ordered  arrived with 2 1/2 shades all broken apart. * highlight is straight glitter if you're into that. 2/4 shades just fell out of their pans. No pigment on lightest shade...and I am very fair. You'd be better off with anything else. The bronzer is not bad though. * I absolutely loved the colors and they have good pigment. I was a big fan of the highligher in particular which had really good color payoff when applying with just a brush. My only issue is that it broke SO EASILY. At first the small clasp that kept the palette closed broke so it wouldn't remain closed. Then small pieces started falling out of the pans and eventually all of them fell out. If this issue was resolved I'd repurchase it * Very sad to write this not because the actual product isn't great, but you can't do anything with the product when it breaks so easily. Bought 2 and same thing happened. Once one breaks there's no fixing everything starts breaking off and it's very messy :("

I like that the packaging is bigger than other drugstore blushes in this kind of packaging, and I really like that it has a locking mechanism and snap faceted cap. It's very easy to use.

 However, it didn't suit my skin. I have dry skin and this dries down too fast for me to blend it out, even over a hydrating primer and with the assistance of a facial mist. It leaves a stain, which is a plus, if you are able to blend it out."

The medium two do work for me as blush but honestly on the skin they look the same.

Beautiful color, and the sparkles are bright and glowing! I used the pink color as eyeshadow and it wasn't too pigmented, but gave a nice glow. * I noticed all the photo reviews of this product are trash and not very helpful. Even the photos of the palette from the site and website aren't too helpful for what this is. I am using the app and realize there's no option to upload a photo as well, so let me explain what you get exactly to aid your decision in purchasing this palette. 

I am happy with the four tones. They are quite different from one another. The first blush on the very left is a pink. It is metallic bright baby pink with blue glitter overspray. Yes, the actual blush is metallic. Like a highlighter. It is not just the overspray. 

The second shade from the left is a warm rose shade. It is less metallic than the pink first one and definitely has a more natural appearance. It has a gold glitter overspray. 

The 3rd shade is a peachy tone with a champagne glitter overspray. It is metallic like the rest of them. 

The last shade is the one that surprised me the most. It is a deep red shade, a burgundy in the pan. It would suit deeper skin tones for sure.  Again, it is metallic and has a gold glitter overspray. 

There's actually not that much glitter overspray as I imagined from reading other reviews. HOWEVER, The shades are metallic (some more than others), so they will give a sheen off your cheeks. The first and last shade are the most highlighter-like shades. 

I am fair-light in skin tone and I am happy with this purchase. I didn't know what I was getting. It is a good value. It would work with even much deeper skin tones due to the sheen and reflection of color that it offers. 

It is not bad. Just know what you're getting. That is shiny blushes with a little bit of glitter. Great value. 

If you want a matte finish, this is NOT for you. And these blushes can actually look natural, except for the first and last shade (too reflective). The 2nd and 3rd blushes give a healthy glow. * Looks so good online but when i picked it and got it home it was chalky and no pigment with tons of big glitter. I cant wear this at 39 years old but maybe good for girls to play ""dressup"" i don't recommend at all save your money on a better quality product."

You will not be disappointed. * A photo doesn't always portray a color accurately or how it will actually look like on your face. Looking at the photo the pallet appears soft pink. It is actually more brown on the skin and like a bronzer. Perhaps trying to make it lighter will help. * This leaves the most unflattering tone on my skin. Not universal and leaves a grey-ash cast. I don't like this AT ALL. Also leaves texture. * Love this LM highlighter I use for an everyday simple look I use my cc cream and LM Chai blush and some mascara to complement my look 🥰 * I was certain I'd love this and ordered it sight unseen. Well, ...

Pros: It has a lovely sheen, noticeable but not metallic or Ofra-y, with zero glitter.

Cons: It's not at all the pale pink you see in the picture, and I'm really not sure what the brand means by ""self-adjusting to match all skin tones."" The color is truer to the product's name; it's a definite, discernible rose. My skin is light to light-medium, not fair by any means, and there's no way this could be a highlighter on me. (Thing is, I don't think it's rich enough to work on deep skin. And it seems too cool to be right for tan skin.) Anyway, on me it's a blush/blush topper for sure.

I can't complain about the formula, and I'm sure I'll use it - but if I'd been able to swatch it first I probably wouldn't have bought it. * I had high hopes for this highlighter but was disappointed when, what I expected to be a pale neutral pink shade was actually a midtoned champagne that's too dark and warm for my very fair, cool toned skin.  

Since this isn't available at any store near me, I bought it based on the photo showing a pale pink swatch, the description of a neutral undertone and the self adjusting shade claim, none of which is accurate.  I could tell just by swatching that it wouldn't work but I applied it anyway and saw that it definitely was too dark and warm.  Since I only wore it for a few minutes, I can't speak to the formula or wear time other than to say it's pigmented with a glitter free buildable shine.  

With the level of technology available, there's no excuse for product photos to be so inaccurate, a problem that also adds to the already excessive amount of wasted makeup.  I love many Laura Mercier products but this was a fail and while I think the shade could work on light to tan skintones, it's too dark for fair and possibly too ashy on deep."

I am usually a peach girly but i have been using magic brownie for almost a year. I appreciate that the packaging is sustainable. Mine has been beat up a but after some time but it has not fallen apart or torn in anyway. * I bought Sexual Flufstration and the color and texture are gorgeous, but the packaging broke immediately. This carton situation really is not practical. You should introduce an actual compact and then sell the refills in the egg carton material. Until then, save your money and buy the lip color and use it on your cheeks too. * Bought this brown blush to try out the ""rich girl makeup"" and its a great putty cream to powder blush but I didnt realize this brand was intended to be used as a custom palette. The foam/paper compact is fragile and it broke so I cant securely close it anymore. * This packaging feels like paper meets styrophome.

Used layered as blush/eyeshadow. May return... It may work for someone else. * Purchased from Ulta.com. Always love to try new brands which is why I ordered this blush (shade: only drama - magenta plum). First, while I appreciate sustainable packaging, I had challenges opening up the lime green packaging - a piece snapped off which did not make me happy. Second, this is supposed to be a cream product (cream to powder) however it's more of a powder.  The positive is that the color is pretty but it's not enough to overcome the cons. * Bought this without checking the ingredients, thinking the brand would know better.

I put it on in the morning and was out in the sun all day and it was still very present on my skin and lips when I got home several hours later. 

The stain is very easy to use on lips, but more difficult to use on cheeks. Having largely used cream blushes, it took several uses to get adapted to the lack of blend-ability for this product. I also need to find another applicator to try to use, as I usually use my fingers to blend out products and as an applicator, but this product stained them. 

I do really appreciate the high quality of both the packaging and the product itself, as well as the mission of the brand Ere Perez and this product as a whole. * I used the Beetroot Cheek and Lip tint primarily as a lip tint. WOW did it last!! Initially when applied to the lips it gives a very vibrant coral pink and red hue that is a little too overwhelming for my taste but when I wiped the lip tint off with a towel and pursed my lips together moving the lip tint around it was a beautiful shade that was perfect for summer.
A Tip- the tint is extremely long lasting (By long lasting I mean almost all day with eating and drinking), with that being said it is also somewhat staining. Precisely apply because I found out if I got it out of where it should be applied, it did not easily wipe off and the stain was still there along with my lipstick for a lot of the day. Also be careful on what the lip tint gets on (fingers, clothes, porous countertops, etc) as it is difficult to get off.
This review was collected as part of a promotion. * The Ere Perez beetroot cheek and lip tinted came in the color Joy. Joy is a bright cherry red color that has a bit of an orange tint to the color. The applicator is strong and not flimsy. When applying it on my lips it went on smooth and covered a good portion of my lips with one swipe. As the product is a tint multiple layers were needed to cover the area and have a build up to be an even layer. The product is light weight and because of that it feels as if you aren't wearing anything on your lips. The color is bright and very pigmented and because of that I choose to not try it on my cheeks. I tried it out after eating and learned that it does not fade evenly. My lips did feel hydrated and unlike other tints didn't have a dry feeling. The finish is a bit glossy rather than a matte color. * As someone new to the world of tints, I was so excited to try this. I was curious to see how it would compare to traditional blushes and lipsticks. 

Starting with thr basics, the packaging: it is sleek and minimalist, which I appreciate. The compact size makes it easy to carry in my purse, perfect for on-the-go touch-ups.
Applying the tint was straightforward, even for a beginner like me. The product glides smoothly onto both cheeks and lips. I found that using my fingers to blend the tint gave me the best results, providing a natural, flushed look. The color is buildable, so you can go for a subtle hint of color or a more dramatic pop, depending on your preference. It left mr with a vibrant, rosy hue that looks very natural on my skin. I got shade ""joy"" which i was worried would be too bright and clownish on me. But it turned out to be a versatile shade that I think would complement a variety of skin tones. The texture is lightweight and not sticky, which I loved. It feels comfortable on the skin and doesn't dry out my lips, a common issue I've had with other lip products.
I was also quite impressed with the staying power. It lasted several hours on both my cheeks and lips without the need for reapplication. Even after a meal, the color on my lips faded gracefully, leaving a nice stain rather than completely disappearing.

Overall, I am thrilled with this product! As my first foray into tints, it has set the bar high. The ease of use, natural finish, and impressive longevity make it a fantastic addition to my makeup routine. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile, high-quality tint that enhances natural beauty. * I used this Ere Perez Beetroot Cheek and Lip Tint in the red color and thought it was a very nice color payoff! I've not previously used a product like this so it was my first experience. The product was very liquidy and had very strong, red coloring. I would definitely recommend to start small with application and add more as needed especially on the cheeks as this was just a lot of color at once. I applied dots on my face and lips then blended them out with my finger. My finger was very stained red but I was able to blend it out well on my cheeks and lips best with my finger. I don't really like wearing red on my lips or face but this gave me a nice flushed appearance and looked very natural. I love that this product uses a lot of natural ingredients and it is really buildable if you want more rich coloring on your lips or face! I think you have to remember that it is not a lipstick or lip gloss and adjust your expectations and usage with this in mind! It does what it's supposed to do! Was certainly a nice product and my first of its kind I've tried! Definitely worth a try! * I am a retired crunchy beauty babe. I will always happily use natural based beauty products, however, I'm very tired these days, and got to a point where it wasn't great for my mental health to focus on all the good, bad, and ugly ingredients out there. That being said, Ere Perez really appeals to that natural loving part of my personality, and I was so excited to try the beetroot tint.
I definitely found some pros and cons with the product, and was left with mixed feelings. She's very pigmented, which is great! I on the other hand, am lacking in the pigment department. I really wanted to like this as a cheek tint or blush, but it appears this is either very much the wrong color for me, I lack the skills necessary to apply it properly, or a combination of both. I tried a few times with various tools, and I don't think we're meant to be a blush relationship.  I am curious about using the stain on my cheeks as part of a tantour situation, but I still think the red is probably just too red for me in this scenario. 
Just because we can't have a cheeky relationship doesn't mean we can't work things out! I really like the beetroot tint as a lip stain! I have been in a brown lip era, so it was a bit of a shock to my senses when I first popped it on as lip color, but it made me remember that sometimes a true red lip is what you need. (Plus, a red lip is a great way to say ""eff you"" to fascism if you're familiar with the history of a red lip.) The stain on its own is a really lovely true red. It is sticky for a moment, but that texture wipes off to a long lasting stain. After a few wears, I realized that it will calm down to a more casual dark pink on its own. I would avoid eating a greasy snack while wearing it unless you're ready to reapply after. 
It has a very mild non offensive flavor when applied - slightly sweet and not very beet-like. Also, it was partner approved. Inappropriate comments were made by him, so I believe he rates it 5 stars. I really hope Ere Perez expands the beetroot line into more colors, so maybe I can find the right cheek shade down the road. 

This review was collected as part of a promotion. * As someone with a very busy schedule, I love adding versatile makeup products to my routine, so I was super excited to try this 2-in-1 lip and cheek tint. The Beetroot Cheek & Lip Tint has become a new must-have for me.

This tint is highly pigmented, so it will definitely last a long time!

I found the best way to use it is to start with a small amount and build up from there. One small dot is all I need to achieve a great blush look for my cheeks. For my lips, I love using a small brush to blend.

I love that I can go from a natural look to a more bold look with just one product!

This is a long-lasting tint; I haven't needed to retouch my makeup (lips or cheeks) while using it! Also, it leaves my lips feeling so hydrated and moisturized!

Overall, this is a great tint that delivers gorgeous results!

I tried to build it up, but couldn't get color payoff.  I've been much happier with liquid blush from the drugstore.  You might have better results with a darker shade than Rose Riot. * I purchased the shade cheeky coral. I have light to medium skin and it does not show up on my skin at all. It breaks apart on my skin then disappears. Ive tried using a sponge, brush, putting it directly on my cheeks, putting it on the back of my hand and no luck :( the color is beautiful though! Does anyone have any tips and tricks on how to get this product to show up and stay on the skin? * Had rhis on my favorites page for a year and extremely disappointed. First use, way too much product came out that i had to waste. Does not blend well, have to use an additonal blush to blend into face. * Perfect finish, can use it alone or layer with a powder blush. It doesn't move my base products around and it doesn't exaggerate my poor skin texture. Ive used multiple brushes to see if it would change the look or finish, but it always blends seamlessly. Highly recommend * I'm not much for make up, so switching to a liquid blush was intimidating but it's pretty easy to use!  You can layer up on how much you want the color to pop, and it stays on an oily face like mine ALL DAY.  I get compliments every time I wear this stuff! 
It's not a crème consistency, so careful with how you squeeze the tube! * Doesn't show any color on my light skin, and so much products leaks out when taking the cap off. Very disappointing!"

I use it as blush and as a balm and loved it. Great for summer heat. * You have to layer on the pigment a million times. I normally like Milani products but this blush is a no go, still prefer prestige brands Blush sticks. * I love, blends so beautifully. So creamy! Can add more for more color tone! Never patchy. My favorite ever, all I do is recommend * Wonderfully creamy, beautiful colors * First, this handy little palette definitely gets the job done and on a pretty good range of skin tones; however, more shades are needed! These powders have a luxury feel to them. Almost buttery, a little can go a very long way! That being said, if you have VERY light skin tones, you're going to want to go in with a light hand and build! On the other hand if you have dark skin tones, you're going to be able to load up your brush and apply. They do build nicely; still though too much of a good thing is too much. So while I absolutely love this concept like the many ""multiple steps palettes""  out there, it's not a one size fits all. Unfortunately finding that one size fits all is extremely hard to find in this department; that's the beauty of people being different! 
In the end, it's a fantastic little palette that I'd highly recommend; especially in an MUA bag or any makeup lovers collection that could benefit from these shades. Great price for great formulas. Now let's see more and more. * Skin is dewy not greasy. Gives a healthy glow. Also, I don't use heavy foundation, I use a CC cream with SPF. I use just enough to even out skin tone. * very pigmented so a little goes a long way. i recommend blending the edges with your phone to make it more seemless."

The formula is a little putty like and reminds me of CP SS Shadows. Super pigmented, super smooth. Would recommend 👌 * Quality is sooo good! * I love this blush and it was so cheap. It lasts really long and the color is beautiful * Its very pigmented and such a pretty color I would definitely buy again. * I purchased Tuti Fluffy and it is a bight hot coral, perfect for deep tones. Unfortunately, i am fair/light and looked like a 🤡 with even the smallest  amt. It feels like a super shock, applies and wears like one too. Very nice formula, just not my shade. Will be exchanging and picking up a couple more. * Super easy to blend and an item beauty blush dupe * I ordered the shade baby mochi and it looks more like a highlighter than a blush honestly. I thought it was a pink/coral shade with gold in it but it is actually a bright gold shimmery color (does not have any pink in it at all). Still looks pretty on the skin and has a good color payoff. Keeping it to use as a highlighter."

I dont use it as a blush, its so pretty as an all over look. Very soft look for my dry face. I've been using pink sands version for years. * just wish the color payout was a little better. I had to rub my blush brush really hard and many times into the pan and build to get much color on my skin. It's a beautiful shade, though. If you're looking for something subtle, this would be great for you. * I like the color ok but wish there was more actual product. Included is a tiny brush and mirror that will never get used. Too much packaging. * i'm a blush fanatic. i love trying new ones. i also love physicians formula. i had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately there's little to no color payoff. i was highly disappointed. i want to like it, but i'm afraid i just don't. * Pretty buttery and gives a subtle glow. However this shade would only show up on fair to light skin. * I would have to use the entire compact to get any color, barely shows up and my skin tone is on the medium olive side. Dave your money. I gave it 3 stars because maybe it will work better for those with super fair skin. * perfect🤩"

Subtle ph changing lip tint and cheek tint. L-o-v-e this so much I have gifted it to multiple people. Throw it in your bag for when you need a little refresher and brightening to your look. Multi-functional and fantastic little tube that I don't know how I ever lived without. * I love it!! I will wear this forever!! It is evem a very good color for school!!!! * I prefer this as a cheek oil - beautiful tint and works well for maturing skin (49yo) and for no-makeup makeup looks. On the lips, it's a bit too thin of an oil to wear on its own, and it dried my lips out quite a bit so it's not really worth wearing for hydration purposes underneath a balm or gloss. I'll use it as a liquid blush. * This has a very cute color, and smells great, but does not have a great consistency. Kinf of like olive oil on the lips. It also dries them out like crazy, along with tasting like literal soap. * Five stars, its a perfect color and looks natural, love the smell. Definitely buying again! * I definitely found it is a little bit drying on my lips but I enjoy the color so I don't mind putting some balm on top. As cheek color, this is a really good shade of pink for me and I find that built up a little bit I get that sunburn look down perfectly. * It's great all my friends tried and where so surprised that it could change colors, and the color was beautiful!"
