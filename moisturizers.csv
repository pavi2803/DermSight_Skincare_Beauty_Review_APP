She really likes the Inside Out branded moisturizer from this line and I thought this would be a good addition. She has no allergies and never reacts to products. She used this and almost immediately said it started to burn! We washed off quickly but it caused her face to become extremely flushed and hot. 
Read the ingredients and found it contains cinnamon bark extract!!! Why in the world would there be cinnamon in a MOISTURIZER Marketed towards youths?!? I would have never even thought to read the ingredients on a hydrating product for ingredients that burn. Needless to say we will be returning! * having sensitive acne prone skin makes it hard trying new products, but i'm so glad i listened to the reviews! this mask leaves your skin so smooth and hydrated and it didn't break me out! highly recommend coming from a licensed esthetician :)"

Out of the 15 products I tried this year, this has been the best option by far. I honestly think this gel moisturizer is even better than Clinique's because it's fragrance free and 100% cruelty free. So many moisturizers are also too heavy for my sensitive and acne prone skin, but this is so lightweight and absorbs quickly.

My previous moisturizer was a bit too heavy, and this one is just right for day and night use!!! * This product is going back! It was recommended to me because they were out of stock of my go-to product (a different brand). Upon applying a thin layer of Tula 24-7 Weightless Moisture Day & Night Gel Cream to my face and neck, something instantly felt off. The texture was fine so I couldn't place what it was. A minute or so later it started - the slight face burning. Minutes passed and it got to the point I couldn't ignore it and had to wash my face yet again just to get it off! * I received this as a free sample and now I'm hooked. It works so great for my skin.

It makes my face more oily than any other moistuzier I've tried.

For about over a year I have been struggling with my face (ezcema, acene, other dry spots, discoloration) and Cerave products were my holy grail, until it wasn't, since then I have tried numerous products, spent $$$$ and nothing work. For the last 3-4months I have been using La Roche Posay face wash & face moisturizer and its been blah. I have only been using it bc i refused to try something else and spend more money. Finally, my sister suggested Dermalogica and OMG!! All this time I had been suffering. I bought the travel size to test it out bc the full size are pricey, but let me tell you, I don't care they are expensive anymore. I have already purchased the full size products and have a full regimen for my facs. Like I said, 

I've only been using the face mositurizer, face wash, the blue bottle exfoliter (twice a week), and the brightening kit (only at night) (all travel size) and my face looks & feels amazing. 

These are expensive products, but theres a spanish saying ""lo bueno cuesta"", in english ""the good things cost"" and with these products, I can agree. Also, a little bit really goes a long way. For the face wash, I only use a pea size and its really more than enough and prettu much same off all other products. * It moisturized my face so good. Unfortunately, i cant stand the bad smell…its so bad! * I am 48 and have been bouncing around forever trying to find the perfect cream for my combination skin.  A little goes a long way.  No greasy residue and moisturizes my dry spots all day long.  My skin is smooth and fine lines are completely blurred after a few weeks of use. Best cream out there for my skin. * I enjoy the smell it reminds me of baby lotion. My skin has never looked so hydrated until this product.

It feels so rich and instantly makes my skin look plump and glowing. Plus, the hyaluronic acid keeps me hydrated all day – I'm obsessed! * My second time purchasing this 
Love the hydration it gives me * I love the Magic Cream product. It applies on smoothly, smells better than most creams on the market, and makes my skin glow! I have been buying this for two years now, and was so happy when Ulta started also selling this last year. * I received the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream and Magic Serum in exchange for my honest review. The Magic Cream is thick and creamy, so it's best to leave sit for a few minutes. It is super helpful for dry skin and works wonders! I highly recommend this product, especially as we approach the colder months. I highly recommend this product- while the price may be high, it is worth it! * Leaving a review because I have the perfect anecdote that is worth reading. I've been using this for two years now and nothing compares. I go on and off of it when I try new expensive creams/moisturizers. I have dullness as an og skin issue where my skin doesn't look as silky clean and plump as I want it to when i apply a cream and this is the only thing that consistently gives me that and brings my skin back to life after time away from it and using something else. I have been yearning for a new night cream lately just out of sheer boredom as I do from time to time and I randomly remembered that about 6 years ago my boujee friend had given me a sample of a cream that I tried once and woke up with baby soft radiant skin. I was just amazed at the drastic overnight difference in that sample.I was broke at that time and assumed it was expensive so I didn't bother to take note of what and where to buy it. Fast forward to now, texted her to hope she could remember that far back and she did! But turns out it was the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream... So in learning the cream I keep going back to is the one that wowed me years ago too is what prompted this review because I realize it is one of the rare products that has truly earned it's place as a staple and has been the only cream to consistently wow me over the span of 5+ years of trying different ones. * Very hydrating moisturizer. This goes on very thick, and I think it would be really nice for mature skin. I didn't notice a huge difference using this product, but overall I would say this is a great investment in skin care. * Let me start by saying this: If I could bathe in Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream, I would. And no, I'm not exaggerating. This cream is like what I imagine unicorn tears and liquid gold combined would feel like on my skin—pure, unadulterated luxury.

I first applied it one evening, thinking, ""Okay, let's see what the hype is all about."" The moment I rubbed it in, I heard a chorus of angels sing, and I'm pretty sure my reflection in the mirror whispered, ""Girl, where have you been all my life?"" Within minutes, my skin went from ""stressed-out and dehydrated"" to ""I've had 8 hours of sleep and an IV drip of green juice.""

Now, let's talk about the texture. It's thick—but not in the way your great aunt's fruitcake is thick. No, this is the decadent, velvety kind of thick that melts into your skin and leaves you looking like you've been airbrushed by the gods. The hydration? Next level. I'm talking ""surviving-the-Sahara-desert"" kind of hydration. It's like my skin just drank a tall glass of water after running a marathon, and it's still basking in the afterglow.

And the scent? A subtle floral elegance that makes you feel like you've been transported to a secret garden, where Charlotte herself is hand-picking petals for your personal batch of cream. Not too strong, just enough to make you feel like you're one luxurious human being.

But here's the kicker: This magic isn't temporary. After a couple of weeks of daily use, my skin genuinely feels softer, plumper, and smoother. I'm convinced my fine lines packed up and left town. I've had strangers ask me what my secret is, and let me tell you, it's a struggle not to whip out the jar and give them an impromptu skincare sermon.

The only downside? My skin now has expensive taste, and I may need to take out a small loan to keep my addiction going. But hey, beauty has its price, and Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream is worth every penny.

In summary: It's not just a cream, it's a life-altering skincare experience. Get it, and thank me (and Charlotte) later."

While it has a nice texture and the ingredients look fabulous, this cream resulted in the worst allergic reaction I've ever experienced. After two uses, my skin was visibly red, tingly, textured, and incredibly itchy. Unfortunately think this damaged my barrier as my skin is still recovering using other tried and tested products. If you have sensitive skin, I'd skip. * Oh how I wanted to love this. The ingredient list looks nice, and I'd heard good reviews, but unfortunately this cream just did not work out for me. I have no idea what's causing it, but this moisturizer somewhat burns my skin every time I apply it. It also seems to be making my facial eczema worse. The texture is different, more of a whipped consistency, but still hydrating. I feel like my skin might need more moisture though. It's also expensive for what it is. Unfortunately it's too late for me to return it, and since it was pricey I'm going to use it up anyways, but I would not repurchase. Honestly you can find many just as good-if not better face creams out there with similar ingredients, that cost much less. * Made skin dry and itchy, not moisturizing. * I use this over the mad hippie super A serum, at night before I go to work. And I love this product. I don't use it twice a day but you probably could if you wanted to. This also feels like a rich moisturizer after I use the mad hippie enzyme scrub, it just makes my skin feel wonderful. I have acne prone skin and also wanted something good for anti aging, since 30 was approaching. * I wanted to love this product. I wanted a night cream with collagen & this has mostly good reviews. But the morning after the 1st time using it, I had 2 huge red zits (which is unlike my normal skin). Every time I use it, I break out the next morning. * Love how soft this cream makes my face feel!

The first night i tried it my whole face was burning, specially my eyes. It was alsmost like i touched chilies and then rubbed by eyes. I washed my eyes with cold water three times and went to sleep cause I literally couldnt bear it. Next morning when i woke up, my eyes were not burning anymore but they were swollen and it took the whole day for it to go down. Because of that, im even scared to try the eye cream from them.

I only need to blot once a day at work instead of three! * I have used FAB products before. Always liked their daily moisturizer but i have oily skin so it didn't help, but this oil control moisturizer helps a lot. My skin doesn't look as shiny. Perfect product for summer. It is not heavy at all. * In my search for an oil-free moisturizer this was recommended. I used this for a month and loved it. No breakouts, controlled my oily skin and seemed to work really well. So, I stocked up and got more. I noticed something was different after the 3rd use of the new jar. I started breaking out. I haven't broken out in almost 3 years. I was confused and continued to use it because why would it start breaking me out now? I loved the first jar. I'm not sure if the formula changed or if my skin is just being finicky. 

Overall, I recommend the product because it seems to be very good. It's a struggle for us oily girls to find products that offer us a balance of hydration while keeping oil at bay. I hope it works for you if you try it :) * Ever since Neutrogena discontinued their Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin - my holy grail of moisturizers - I have been desperately searching for a replacement that will keep my breakouts under control without over-drying my skin. The search is finally over - this is it!! My skin starting clearing up and looking healthier after the first overnight application! I've now been using it for 2 months and it's continued to significantly reduce my breakouts (in frequency and duration) without drying out my skin. The only downside is that the container is about half the size I was assuming it would be, based on other FAB products I've purchased. (Although that's on me for not looking at the size printed on the front of the product.) Each container lasts me a little over 2 months with one application per day on my face and sometimes neck and/or chest. Honestly though I'm in love. * Ive used this product for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin and have used several different face moisturizers over the years and this is the only one that keeps my face from getting super shiny by the end of the day, even with serums underneath it. It WORKS so to me its worth every penny! * This is the best moisturizer I have ever found for my oily skin! I have an oily t-zone and this keeps my skin from becoming oily all day. I worked an 8-hour shift wearing this and when I got home my forehead was still dry, but not peeling, it just felt finally normal. I use this on my entire face, but keep in mind you can use it only in certain areas that you struggle with oil, so don't let other reviews about dry skin deter you. With winter coming up I may begin to only use this on my oily areas and another moisturizer on others, but this is literally the holy grail moisturizer for anyone struggling with oily skin. * I have combination skin and this has saved my skin texture and made it so soft. The consistency feels so nice and it's not overly drying even in my dry areas. Feel like it's reduced some redness as well."

When I pressed the pump down, mostlt water came out. I e-mailed the company, and they responded that it needed to be mixed up or shaken. I had already tried that. They acted like it was my fault. Don't waste your money. * Not sure what happened but this time my product has a lot of water in it than the cream itself.  Not really happy with product this time. * Really love how this product makes most of my face feel. Around my nose and mouth, my skin feels very tight and dry, but it does not. I've been using it for about a week and a half, so I am hoping it is just my skin getting used to it. The package is great, but the way it comes out is a little annoying as I feel like I don't know how much to press. Overall, a great product! * it moisturizes nicely, but not quite enough for my super dry skin. i put consistency as both a con and a pro. sometimes its nice and light, yet moisturizing. other times it feels thicker/doesnt blend in as easily. my main complaint is that (maybe its my batch?) theres so much water in the bottle. when i pump it, sometimes straight water comes out. i even tried to shake the bottle up thinking itd help and it didnt really. beads of water just come up with the lotion. when its so expensive, i wish it was mixed properly or contained less water. if not that, i wish there were a way i could mix it up but with the packaging, although cute and creative, i cannot. * I've been using this for a while & always softens ny face. I love the idea of adding bloom drops. I use it in winter a lot because my skin gets dry and theres no spf in this. I've had 6-7 bottles of this & at the end I wonder if i got all the product. I finally got bored and determined ans managed to get my last bottle open and was stunned at how much product was left both under the lid and in the bottle. Now I think of how much product I've trashed in the past 6-7 bottles. I'm thinking they owe me 1/2 bottle. * I have mostly oily, but combination skin. 
I use tretanoin.
When i first started using this i had a damaged skin barier from over exfoliating.
Over exfoliating made my perioral dermatitis flare up and this didnt burn it or make it red!! It was amazing. Its light weight. I dont even use a full pump. I thought id hate the pump but its actually great, if you have long nails pump moisturizers are goated i bet. But my only nag was that i had my last bottle a bit long and somehow the oils and cream separated. So id pump it and thered be moisturizer but the oil would be spilling off my fingers. Id still purchase this again anyway but definitely pay attention to your best by date, im sure if it wasnt a pump it could be remixxxed but idk. Maybe ill pump the rest into a tiny container * I have combo skin and get a lot of oils in my t-zone. This mosturizer takes a long time to set in. It comes out of tube fast which left me having to use too much because it's impossible to get product back in a tube. Also, the bloom cap got stuck in the twist of lid and I couldn't even use it after not having it for long. I unfortunately won't be re-pruchasing."

I have oily skin and probably spend upwards of $1K a year on products trying to find things that actually do as they claim, and this is one of them.

I was a little reluctant to purchase this as the price is pretty high for a brand I've never used, but I'm glad that I took the risk on it.  Prior to this moisturizer I was either using none at all (because most others just make me more oily, dont need redundant products on oily skin), or I was using the La-Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Matte one which didn't do much for me. Obviously how this will work for you is going to be different for everyone, and the other products you use prior to your moisturizer will make a difference as well.

For reference I am a 28 yr old female, white/Caucasian.  My morning routine is: wash with a clay based cleanser (Dermalogica), tone (Fenty Skin), hyperpigmentation serum (Good Molecules), niacinamide/zinc serum (Sunday Riley), then this moisturizer. The consistency of this product is great for oil as it is a gel based product, but it comes out more opaque white than clear which is fine. It does not have much of a fragrance that I have noticed, but I'm not sensitive to fragrance so I wouldn't be one to say. When I put this on it almost feels as if it is a crossover between a moisturizer and a makeup primer that blurs your pores.  Now it does not make your pores go away by any means, but it does HELP.  Immediately after applying my skin is definitely mattified but again, not completely shine free as if it is a primer with the sole purpose of making your skin look like it has powder on it. It does not make my skin feel tight and dried out, it genuinely makes me feel moisturized and smooth without the glowy look that normal moisturizers do. From my experience it definitely does not keep me matte for 8 hours, I would say after about 3-4 hours I start to see shine on my face to the point where I feel the need to blot if I were going out somewhere (this is all without wearing makeup or anything on top of my morning skin routine, I work from home).

If you truly have an oily/combo skin type this is not going to be your holy-grail product that makes all of your problems disappear (will continue to search for it), but if it is within your budget for a product of this type then this is 100% top 5 best moisturizers for oily skin on the market right now in my opinion after having used this for a few weeks now.  Would repurchase (and I rarely ever find products I do)!  

I also just want to throw out there that I did buy this on my own, was not asked/paid to write this, and I think this is either my only review I've ever written on Ulta or one of a few over a span of years that I don't even remember. * The packaging is very luxe but the pump feels like its empty and its still half full. It doesn't mattify anything but it is a nice mix of a gel and lotion and a lightweight moisturizer. This is an MLM and I do feel it's overpriced for what it is. It's pretty basic. * Matte effect that works great as a moisturizer/ primer for oily skin types"

I would not recommend using this product if you have sensitive skin.

I've used the 100-hour moisture gel, and I would have to couple it with a face serum. I felt it only worked best for gripping makeup.

This is so worth the price, as a little goes a long way. * I use this daily and find it to work well.  It's not greasy, which I really like.  Your skin feels dewy even the next day.   My daughter and DIL are obsessed, so their Christmas stockings always contain a large jar!"

But I am utterly disappointed. It caused severe eye irritation that i had to go see an ophthalmologist. No sunscreen has caused me such reaction so i was worreid. However i do think it's a good moistirozer with SPF but its just not for me. * This moisturizer initially feels amazing on the skin, and it worked well under my makeup. However, after a few hours, my eyes began to burn and sting! It happened on 2 separate days so i know that it is this moisturizer. Again, i really wanted to like this but it really irritates my eyes. * This is a really great SPF moisturizer. It really holds up to its name. I've been looking at this brand for months and finally got it. I've only been using this for a little under a week but this by far, has been the best SPF moisturizer I've EVER used. Someone who works at Ulta said this was a really great product; she was correct. What sold me is when she said it holds up really well for people who have oily skin, which is an issue for me so I have an issue with products that make my skin extra oily. This is very lightweight and worth the money. I just need to see how this holds up with this FL heat. * I thought this was the perfrct match for me as i am lazy and hate having to layer moisturizer with an SPF and get greasy quick. This dries down matte at first but within an hour or so is super greasy and makes my face very shiny. For the price I expected better. * I tend to find most sunscreens to be greasy, oily, or sticky even when they claim otherwise. I assumed this would be the same especially since its a sunscreen moisturizer combo. However I was wrong!  The texture and finish is so so lovely. It's very lightweight and glides on nicely, moisturizes without leaving me feeling like a shiny greasy mess! It's perfect under make too. Highly recommend! * It is weightless but it burns yours eyes terribly when you go to take it off ...and it's not sweat proof...for the almost $50 this is I expect more out of a spf moisturizer. There are drugstore brands that can offer the same for a way less price point. Definitely returning. * For some reason, every other facial sunscreen I've tried either made my face red and hot, had a sticky texture, or made my skin bumpy and textured afterwards. This is the only sunscreen without any of these issues! It feels like a regular, lightweight moisturizer in every way, and washes off easily without any texture or stickiness."

I am officially 51 years old.  My skin is incredibly HAPPY!!!!!  I have used TULA products for the past 6 years and when i saw this particular set on sale during the 21 days of beauty I HAD TO BUY IT!!!!!!!!  PLUS i was able to use my 20% off AND my ULTA REWARDS!!!!!!  So i got this for a STEAL!!!!!  OK so NO More bragging about me.  TULA has some of the ABSOLUTE BEST ANTI AGING AND SPECIFIC ROUTINE ADDRESSING PRODUCTS!!!!!!   I have had issues with drying skin around my mouth (upper area to chin).  And i have used everything under the sun!  However when i got to use the TULA 24/7 cream:  I WAS INCREDIBLY HAPPY!!!!!!!!!  Finally my skin is HYDRATED AND FEELING WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!  And I not oily on my forehead or nose!!!!!!!!!!  Love, LOVE TULA PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!! * This product made my oily face feel even greasier. * I did not like any product in this bundle. The facial cleanser doesn't get makeup off well. The moisturizer left my skin greasy, The brightening undereye stick didn't do anything but make my concealer go on wrong. * I love tula and a lot of there products however, definitely try one of there products before getting this bundle! I have sensitive skin and rosacea, i tried there firming moisturizer first before i bought this to see if i would have a reaction to tula products
The bundle is definitely a great deal and so far i have no issues or no break outs, its been a week! * Tula has helped my skin so much! I was scared to use it at first because my skin is so sensitive! But since ive been using i dont get big painful breakouts anymore! My skin is clear, soft, and glowing! I also used to have the little sweat bumps on my face, completely gone since using this! It did take about two weeks to see the results! So if you wait youll see the difference! On month 3 of using it! * The reviews got me on this one and I decided to give it a try. Spoiler, I regret it so much. This is definitely not for sensitive skin with all of the highly fragrant ingredients in it. I thought my face was purging but after two months, I couldnt take it anymore. Its been 3 months sonce stopping and im still trying to recover from the skin damage it caused. Not all skin types are alike but I think less basic skin care is probably best. The eye balm is nice and works with awaking but I also think it made my dark circles worse. * My favorite is the so polished exfoliating scrub, but all of the products complement each other. I look forward to washing my face now!"

This is it! Love the clean ingredients and that it doesnt have much of a smell. My husband has even started using it, and that is saying something. * I have tried so many moisturizers. I have sensitive skin and I am also very careful with certain ingredients I use on my skin. This is the best moisturizer, it's hydrating but not greasy and great for day or night. I just mix it with my sunscreen in the morning. * I wanted to love this moisturizer because its clean- I didn't even mind the smell even though some complain about it. But I noticed after several weeks of use, I had many blackheads on my nose and chin. I didn't realize it wasn't non-comedogenic so that was on me for not paying attention. If you have acne or get breakouts, I wouldn't recommend this. * I wish the people who get the products for FREE other wise known as influencers would just be honest. I found it no big deal I've used other products for alot less money, but the 5 ⭐ crews won't be getting free stuff if they don't give a high score. Wait a few weeks to buy it and if you don't like return it, so this is an HONEST review. * Love it!! * I highly recommend this! I kept finding moisturizers that either broke me out or pilled on my face (deal breaker). This one does neither and keeps my face moisturized. It is on the pricey side, but I bought it on sale. The only thing I don't love is the smell. At first it just smells like nothing, but once I rub it in it's almost a chemical smell? Not sure, but I'll take that over not breaking me out. * It goes on like silk and makes your face feel soft and smooth. Feels good after I put on my toner and serums and then it's like a nice after finish. Good smell. Overall the best moisturizer I've used. Somewhere between a gel and a cream"

As soon as I got this onto my dry hands. The crème absorbs so nicely into my skin. The scent is light and fresh. The packaging is pretty end simple. I also enjoy that it's not greasy and just feels luxurious on the skin * This cream is so good! I have never heard of this brand, but was pleasantly surprised. I feel like my skin looks brighter and smoother after using it for a week so far! * Ole Henriksen Hydrating Multi-Use Cream is a versatile, hydrating skincare product designed to deeply moisturize and nourish the skin. It can be used on the face, hands, or any dry areas of the body, making it a multi-purpose item in your skincare routine.
The cream contains a blend of nourishing ingredients such as shea butter, hyaluronic acid, and avocado oil, which work to lock in moisture and help keep the skin hydrated throughout the day.
Despite its rich hydration, the formula is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling greasy or heavy. It has calming ingredients that can help to soothe dry or irritated skin, making it suitable for sensitive skin types.addressing dryness, rough patches, and even helping to soften cuticles or hands.
The texture is creamy but not overly thick, which makes it suitable for day-to-day use.   It has a pleasant, light citrus scent, which I found refreshing.  The moisturizing and nourishing elements make it perfect for those dealing with dryness.  It's a good option for combating the harsh effects of cold, dry weather on skin.   Ole Henriksen is on the the pricier side, so this cream might be considered an investment for those on a budget.   All in all The Ole Henriksen Hydrating Multi-Purpose Cream is a solid choice if you're looking for an all-around moisturizer that offers hydration, nourishment, and soothing benefits for various skin types. While it's particularly well-suited for dry skin, it's versatile enough for multiple uses across your body. * The Ole Henriksen Hydrating Multi-Purpose Crème has a lightweight texture that feels luxurious on the skin and smells refreshingly clean. While it contains beneficial ingredients like glycerin and shea butter, it didn't quite meet my hydration needs for very dry skin, leaving me wanting more. I appreciated the inclusion of vitamin E and botanical extracts, which added a soothing touch to the formula. The packaging is sleek and sturdy, making it easy to travel with and store without any mess. Its scent is light and subtly floral, adding a touch of indulgence without being overpowering. Overall, it's a pleasant product, but it might work better as a layering moisturizer rather than a standalone solution for very dry skin. * leaves skin moist.  love this * Bought this for my husband. He's not quick to be very excited about skincare products but he was about this one. It has transformed his super dry skin to a moisturized skin. He uses it every day and it actually made his skin less bumpy and more smooth. The texture is rich to the touch, yet doesn't take forever to sink into the skin. He applies it once a day and that's enough to keep him from feeling dry on the face. This product did not have a bad reaction to his eczema."

It's plenty moisturizing, and gets absorbed right away.

It also has done a pretty decent job of keeping it moisturized without any dry spots or flaking. Will repurchase especially since its a great price point. * I love the moisturizer. I love how it's perfect for my skin, but I've been getting bumps recently on my skin has been a little dehydrated and I don't know if it's in the moisturizer, but my skin has been really dry lately. That's it. Bye * I've been using this product for about a week, and so far I am incredibly impressed. It's lightweight, incredibly moisturizing, fragrance free, works fabulously under makeup. I have sensitive skin, and often struggle with finding a product that works for me. This is a great product for a great price. * This product is super light weight yet so hydrating! I love it so much, definitely one of my favorite mosturizers yet! 100% worth a try! * This isn't a bad product, it's a great moisturizer for oily skin. Good for kids but impractical for adults or even teens. Wouldn't buy again, there's better on the market that will positively impact your skin."

I never put lotion on my face and just started using this product and I get so many compliments now how nice I look and young. I am almost 45 but I don't look it. * My beauty consultant, Beautifull (yes! that is her name) is the best in the business! I had so many questions when I was looking for a skin routine. I must say my skin is WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. She is located in North Texas! * I stopped buying moisture surge (and clinique in general) earlier this year, and searched for a comparable moisturizer all of 2024. Out of the 15 products I tried this year, this has been the best option by far. I honestly think this gel moisturizer is even better than Clinique's because it's fragrance free and 100% cruelty free. So many moisturizers are also too heavy for my sensitive and acne prone skin, but this is so lightweight and absorbs quickly. It's definitely worth the price, and a little goes a long way. * This is so light and so hydrating, it does not leave any sticky residue on the skin and no harsh smell. It cools the face and gives it a nice glow * I'm in my mid 40s, with sensitive combination skin, and this gel cream has been absolutely fantastic!  My previous moisturizer was a bit too heavy, and this one is just right for day and night use!!! * This product is going back! It was recommended to me because they were out of stock of my go-to product (a different brand). Upon applying a thin layer of Tula 24-7 Weightless Moisture Day & Night Gel Cream to my face and neck, something instantly felt off. The texture was fine so I couldn't place what it was. A minute or so later it started - the slight face burning. Minutes passed and it got to the point I couldn't ignore it and had to wash my face yet again just to get it off! * I received this as a free sample and now I'm hooked. It works so great for my skin. It leaves it refreshed without being heavy. Other moisturizers can be too thick but this is thin and blends perfectly. Worth the purchase!"

So far, this works to make my cheeks less red without giving me acne. It also lessened a wrinkle caused by an acne scar. * I originally bought this product when it was on sale. I liked it well enough, but it ended up taking a backseat to my other well-loved lotions and creams. Then I got pregnant and developed cystic acne on my chin that was painful, and I couldnt get it to go away. I tried switching out my favorite Cerve nighttime cream for this Avene cream and OMG those large, deep pimples cleared up in a matter of days! I'm so thankful I had this on hand and will definitely be repurchasing. * Worked wonders for me and all the small bumps on my skin disappeared after using this * I absolutely love this stuff and always have a bottle on hand! Its great for sensitive skin that is prone to irritation. Any time I've had skin reactions on my face, this is the product I reach for to help with the itchiness and dryness. It's very hydrating (a bit thicker) while still working well with oily skin.

I'm using in combination with GM mandelic acid serum and panoxyl wash. I don't have sensitive skin. * Loving This retinol so far. I've been thoughtful doing research on more non toxic cleaner ingredients- but also actual works- it's been almost two weeks and i have sensitive skin and no irritation, so far, im liking the product. * It's perfect to me * Im only 18 but ive noticed some forehead wrinkles/fine lines lately so I bought this and its worked surprisingly well. I have very sensitive skin and it hasnt burned or caused acne at all. Im very happy with the product for sure! * Get this! I use 3-4x a week and have seen SUCH an improvement with skin texture and acne. Helps my breakouts clear up faster, and my skin feels smoother than it ever has. Not drying for me.

The texture is so lovely and it's not sticky or tacky. Works with other products with no issues. My only complaint is I wish P&L would get rid of the jar packaging. * Tried this brand/cream and was content with it. It moisturizes OK but leaves a slightly sticky residue on the surface of my skin which i did not like when it dried. I still prefer my Laneige water bank cream because its similar price/size, feels more hydrating and no sticky residue. I would probably not buy this again because i prefer another brand. * This is actually a really good moisturizer, and at a way better price then a lot of other ones out there.

Great for very dry skin and in the winter. * I was on the hunt for a hydrating moisturizer and while this certainly fit the bill, if you, like me, have congestion-prone skin, I would recommend looking elsewhere.

My skin felt immediately healthier and really retained moisture! Would recommend to annoying looking for really good moisturizer. * I do like this, it's my 2nd time purchasing it. I think I like Neutrogena hydroboost gel better (blue tub with white lid) and that has a better proce tbh. This is mu 2nd favorite I'd say. * I've been using this moisturizer for 3+ years now, and it's very noticeable when I try out other moisturizers. I get acne and the texture gets a little rougher. It goes on so smooth and light. Not greasy whatsoever. I have pretty normal skin, with a slightly oily nose. I hate that I have to spend so much for moisturizer but at this point I am just accepting that if I want nicer skin this is what I have to do. 

I also sometimes use the same line of cleanser and almost daily use the salicylic acid cleanser. I have tried different combos of different moisturizers and cleansers from other brands alongside these and have really found that the absolute best combo is this moisturizer with the salicylic cleanser from LRP. Such a game changer for my face. * I have sensitive skin so I'm always leery of trying new products. This moisturizer works well and has not led to any reactions * I like that it has niacimide and compared to the Vanicream it moisturizes my face a lot more. I have really dry skin and I see a difference. I'll definitely keep buying. A little goes a long way. * I wanted to love this moisturizer but I broke out with those small bumps.  It is affordable, I normally use Tula and this La Roche was affordable but just not the right product for me.  It isn't greasy and has just a little tack not too much. * So far, it is working out. I just use a little over my face. Seems to calm everything down and doesn't irritate my skin. The Roche Posay double repair is nice"

I love the way it moisturizes and doesn't leave a greasy feel. Skin on my face feels so soft all day long. Had to buy a full size and now the gift one is in my travel bag. * My mother bought this product and I noticed it had a strong fragrance to it. Now I'm not a dermatologist, but I have enough knowledge to know that anything fragrance is horrible for your skin. Anyway, my skin broke out in hives when I tried this product, along with acne. Please don't buy skincare from Lancome, it's not the best for most people. * I love how this looks on my skin! It's matte but hydrating. Happy that it has hyaluronic acid as well. My makeup looks so good now! I used to use tatcha but didn't like oily it made my skin look. This will now be my go to! * I have normal to dry skin, but a lot of moisturizers will clog my pores if i sleep in them. I just stopped wearing a mositurizer to bed altogether for a while for this reason. When I saw the ingredients in this I became curious and decided to give it a try. My skin is so hydrated and looks beautiful in the morning! Also, if i develop a blemish during the day, I will still slap this moisturizer on top of it at night and not only does it not make it worse, it actually heals it and my skin clears up so much faster! Highly recommend this product. * This was recommended to me by the consultant and I love it."

I love how affordable it is, considering there is a plethora of steep moisturizers in this store! 

I would not recommend using this product if you have sensitive skin. My good friend tried it out and was dissapointed to discover it gave her face a burning sensation (as did Good Molecules Hyaluronic Acid Serum). * I have extremely dry skin, and this moisturizes it so well. Bonus points, it doesn't peel with make up. * Didn't cause any breakouts or anything but did not moisturizer even a single bit. My face was rlly dry and dull when wearing this. Wouldn't rlly recommend tbh:( * This is the perfect lightweight moisturizer that feels creamy but doesnt make me an oily mess by the end of the day. I like trying new products so I very rarely repurchase items, but dare I say this is my holy grail daily moisturizer! * I use this moustrizer along with their hylauronic acid serum, and it works great! * I really like this moisturizer. I love that it comes in a tube, is super lightweight, smells great and leaves my face feeling hydrated all day with no greasy residue. Also love that it's less expensive than my regular choice, which is a little heavier than this. I might be a convert! * A little greasy but it hydrates well and sits nice under makeup!

Issue is, after a while of daily use, my skin would feel dry; even patchy.

Out of the entire set this is the one I use consistently because of the way it feels. Woke up today and forgot I used to have age spots. They're gone. * This has a strong perfume smell.  I bought it half off during days of beauty.  Reviews are good but that strong perfume smell.  might use it on chest instead of face to use up. * Ive tried a lot of face creams, this is definitely in my top 3. This cream is ideal for mornings where you want something moisturizing but not too oily. I can also see a difference in brighness and fine lines. I also feel like this cream works with most skin types. I have dry skin and it works well as a day cream. * About two months ago I received a super sample of this and I was SHOCKED at the difference in my skin within 48 hours. My fine lines were already fading and my skin was taught. At 46 years old I've tried every serum and moisturizer, including high end brands such as Sunday Riley and Drunk Elephant only to be left with little to no results and wasted money. This particular line of Lancome products is expensive and beyond my normal budget but it is worth every penny. I just started using the serum and these products have changed my life. I will always look for the best sales and discounts but if I would pay full price because this moisturizer is magic and now a permanent staple in my skincare routine and I HIGHLY recommend this for all women my age and up in need of help fighting fine lines and wrinkles and skin elasticity. * This product has improved the appearance of my skin without causing any breakouts. I love the texture and it has a pleasant smell to it * I've always used the old formula for years, but when I was given the travel size when I had purchased a set it came with it and I DID NOT like it. It felt too gelish that I was skeptical in purchasing this size. But I did anyway because Lancôme has been my go to brand for years now. I feel in love, my face felt so smooth and plump on the first try. Loved the way my makeup set and looks. Definitely a keeper!!"

The store associate introduced me to the Juice line, and it is the first product line that I honestly felt almost instantaneous results. * I started with the samples and i was really hoping I would hate it since it is so expensive. Unfortunately I loved it, and now I'm forced to spend a fortune on skincare. Use with their vitamin c, primer, foundation and translucent powder and your aging face will thank you, but your bank account won't. * I love juice beauty's products so I couldn't wait to try this product! I used it night cream the first night I got it and woke up and washed my face and placed on the day cream. Moments afterward my face began to feel very itchy and uncomfortable. If I would itch it would leave scratch welts all over my face (what it looks like when a dog jumps up and scratches you is the best way to describe it), followed by an itchy sensation from my head to my toes. Once I would itch I would get little hive bumps and the scratch welts all over my body. Very sad this product did not work out for me, but wanted to warn others that have sensitive skin. * This moisturizer is very thick and seems to be a great product with the exception of the smell. It is a vibrant apple/lemon like a candy. 
Reminds me of a teenage type product, unfortunately it is to potent to use at night, to try to fall asleep it just keeps me up. * I love both the day and night moisturizer. The day is light and great under makeup, the night is thicker and really hydrates my skin. They also smell great!"

I know its not my skin since i exfoliate - so it shouldn't be doing this. I'm disappointed. * This product is very drying to me. I have used much cheaper products that made my skin feel way better than. Def wont be repurchasing * Immediately pills and doesnt layer other products well. I was really excited to try this:/ * This is one of the best moisturizers I have used. I use tretinion as my retinol and it tends to make my skin dry and flaky. I don't have that issue using this product. I see a lot of people complain about the strong rose scent. It think its delightful and doesn't linger too long but you have to understand what the product is derived from which rose petals snd buds. I use it day and night it I have seen improvements in my skin texture. * Got this on sale to try out some other moisturizer options (go-to is Peach&Lily matcha pudding). The texture is wonderful, and I do think it helped with my dry/sensitive skin, but I am not personally a huge fan of the strong fragrance. * i loved this moisturizer until i realized it wasnt cruelty free… a very nice subtle rose scent that i loved. sad i have to discontinue using this moisturizer."

I apply it alone to my neck after serums and moisturizer but do mix with my foundation when I apply to my face. * I was given the sunscreen by my mom try, but after a few weeks of using it I notices it made my skin extremely dry. It also caused my make up to separate even when allowing 15 minutes to dry before applying foundation. I've increased my moisturizer usage hoping that would help offset the dryness, but it has not helped at all. This sunscreen has an odd smell to it. * I've had such a hard time finding a face sunscreen that didnt mess with my skin or makeup and this is it! I'm obsessed with how easy it is to apply after my skincare and it was no issue at all with my makeup after application! It doesn't have a typical sunscreen smell. I will say, for someone like myself who had oily combo skin, this might be a hit or miss for you, but for myself personally I didn't mind it at all :) * My sister-in-law got this and I've always wanted to try it and have it my own and I love it 😊 * Smells terrible and goes on like flaky paste. Overall gross feeling. Very dissatisfied. * I've tried countless sunblocks, most of which caused me breakouts and I usually hate the way they feel on my skin or smell. This one is my GOAT.

A little goes a long way. * I was concerned about the switch to a new line of creams as I've been using the old smart night cream for years as a night cream, but overall have been satisified with the change. I'm 29 and was recommended by an Ulta employee in the store the lifting face + neck cream. The cream is a completely new product. It is thicker, much firmer texture than the old one. It is also bright white. It does not have a noticeable fragrance. (The jar says fragrance free). I use it as a night cream and can definitely see and feel the difference in 'firmness' and 'lifting' in my neck; although I didn't think I really needed it and that wasn't why I used the original night cream. I have noticed some white heads in my forehead/T-Zone, but I tend to get them occasionally anyway so I can't blame the cream on it. After reading about the other variations, I wish I had the SPF version so I can try wearing it twice a day with my makeup over it. I'll be giving this one to my mom and trying the SPF one next. :) * This is returnef the plumpness to my cheeks has lifted my laugh lines and I don't look as sallow under my eyes.

Also, I really love the pump so it does not ruin the efficacy of the rest of the product. 10/10 * I have purchased this product before and especially like the way it controls the amount needed on the top. It also is a fantastic retinol seum in cream! Goes on smoothy and feels good on the skin. * I buy this It product when it is on sale,  as the product itself is OK.   HOWEVER, I wish they would change the pump lid....it works a few times and then stops.  You end up having to unscrew it just like a normal jar to get the moisturizer out.  It needs to stop wasting money on these lids and quit trying my patience.  A NORMAL Lid is preferred to one that quits working. * I love this serum!! It feels really good on my face and i see a small difference in my wrinkles * I have sensitive skin and use this daily. I see the results within hours. My skin feels tighter. My pores are reduced. After a few days all the pores and blackheads on my nose almost gone. The fine lines on my forehead and undereyes have diminished. * Product is incredible. Results are almost immediate * Hello Results did not offer much wrinkle or fine line reduction however it was a very nice moisturizer. I would only recommend this for a retinol beginner."

I've used it for years along with their gentle face wash. * I have extremely sensitive skin and live in a dry climate. I have tried multiple moisturizers ranging anywhere from more natural, low-ingredient to high-end, dermatologist grade. Everything either made me breakout, left my skin red and still dry, and in some cases even caused chemical burns. I've tried brands like CeraVe, Ethique, Clinique, Dermalogica, etc. and none seem to help. After doing some research, I saw others say this low-ingredient, fragrance-free moisturizer helped them. After only a few uses, I was AMAZED!! My skin stayed hydrated all day, was noticeably less red, and wasn't breaking out. 
I would say maybe start with the lotion if you're on the oily side or live in a more humid climate. But as someone with already dry, sensitive skin and living in a dry climate, this has worked WONDERS. Cannot recommend enough. I hope the formula never changes! * This was a highly recommended product on tiktok so of course i had to try it out. Its a good price for the amount you get, but not a good moisturizer in my opinion. The product did not absorb at all, sat on top of my skin all night, quite sticky, and made it impossible to get comfortable since my hair would get stuck to my face if i moved. Product also had an unpleasant smell. * I love that it's moisturizing, but having super sensitive skin like I do, I was expecting it to not make my face break out in a rash. * This product is awesome and helped soothe my daughters eczema on her hand * I purchased this becauae of a tiktok I saw. I thought it would be okay to use on my face even though I have ""normal"" skin because this is a product for ""sensitive"" skin, meaning it would be okay for any skin type (so I thought). I broke out after 2 days of using it. I don't normally breakout, so when a whole patch of zits popped up on both my cheeks and forehead, I was so confused. I stopped using it 
after another day because I knew nothing else I was using caused this since everything I normally use hasn't caused this reaction. After about 3 or 4 days, everything cleared up and I am now going to return this. Lesson I took away from this, don't buy everything you see someone asvertising on tiktok! * I was influenced from tiktok and was so excited to not spend so much money on skincare, but this left me with the worst acne I've ever had in my life. I recently saw something that said it clogs pores and I can't use it on my face anymore."

Very happy to say my skin did not redden and the dryness is pretty much gone.  I also really like the smell.  Has a spa smell in my opinion.  However, I would prefer to not apply perfumes products to my face, so would greatly appreciate a fragrance-free version.  Actually surprised the fragrance hasn't caused irritation.  The other thing I wish for is more product for the price.  The packaging is quite large and heavy, but upon opening, you realize there is little product compared to the size of the container.  Despite the fragrance, which again - I do like - and the amount of product for the money, I'm definitely going to continue using this Elemis product. * I absolutely love this product and make my skin feel amazing.   I have used so many, but nothing compares to this face cream. * I found this product 3 years ago while in the Caribbean; so excited to see it available at Ulta. * I really like the texture and smell of this cream. Not sure how effective the spf 30 is as I really haven't worn it outdoors much. Found out they use this line on Disney cruises so makes it feel more special. It's definitely a splurge but I like it a lot. * I have been using this awhile now, followed a recommendation by now and gen blog, and she has flawless skin.

It's an incredible night cream. I wake up with the softest face and skin. * I was lucky to get this 50% off during Ulta sale. The more I use it the more I like it. I think its a great morning cream and it rivals the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Youth cream. It does well under makeup. Its also good for my dry skin without it being too oily for day time. I would like to try the one with SPF. * I bought this during the sale at 50% off. I think its a perfect cream for dry or combo skin. It doesn't leave my skin too greasy, but rather hydrated. * I recieved a little sample packet of this cream in an order. My skin isn't very sensitive, so I always try out samples. Nice way to discover new products!

After using this product, I had to double check to make sure I wasn't using a cream cleanser. The frangrance threw me off; It smells heavily of soap to me. Like bar soap. I wouldn't perchance this for myself, because I feel like I need to rinse off. However, I love the consistency and would like it very much if it didnt have that soapy smell. :/ * I want to love it bevause its so moisturizing but its very heavily perfumed and makes me breakout * As a person with ""mature"" skin I am happy to revisit this product. I tried it several years ago and it was too much for my skin but these days it is perfect. It's works well under make up and I also use it at night over serums."

She used this and almost immediately said it started to burn! We washed off quickly but it caused her face to become extremely flushed and hot. 
Read the ingredients and found it contains cinnamon bark extract!!! Why in the world would there be cinnamon in a MOISTURIZER Marketed towards youths?!? I would have never even thought to read the ingredients on a hydrating product for ingredients that burn.

Love these produxts, and yeah the funky smell and texture is because these are clean products instead of chemicals! ❤️❤️❤️ * I've been through 3 bottles and haven't noticed any significant difference in my skin. It was helpful when I had some breakouts in clearing them in a timely manner, but other than that, nothing. I decided to branch out recently and try another retinol product from a different brand, and I'm realizing what I've been missing out on, and at a lower price point! Overall, I don't hate it, but it really did nothing for my skin. * I love it! I have a combination skin. My t zone always gets oily with white heads. I started using it last year and it really helped clear and brightened up my face. I continue to use it since it keeps white heads away and oiliness at bay. * Love the way it leaves my skin feeling.  I wasn't going to try but had to check it out.  And it was definitely worth my gold coins. * Smaller than the free samples it came with * It is a strong product that must be used as directed. If used properly it will reveal a brighter, better looking skin. * No negative side effects even using it overnight. But I noticed absolutely no difference in my skin after 2 months. It's way too expensive to not show any improvements."

It absorbs well, softens skin, and doesnt leave skin greasy or tacky. I would buy a big bottle of this. I wish it werent so expensive. * I was looking for something that might be better than the Cerave lotion I was using for a long time that had parabens in it. My skin is sensitive and lots of things tend to irritate or break me out. Nothing changed but this lotion. I don't know what's in it that did it, but I immediately started breaking out. It claims to be for sensitive skin, but I'll take the parabens over that. And they've recently taken them out. So I won't be using this lotion. * This is not gentle whatsover!!! It smells like paint thinner and Shea butter not in a good way either..

I researched this TBT cream online it found out that its a retinol alternative, which is awesome! My mom is a sun worshipper and these past two summers have left with her fine lines all over her face. She cant use traditional retinols because she has rosacea and very sensitive skin. Just bought her a full dozed jar, Mom approves it and recommends it. * Ive used clinique for years due to my sensitive skin. I am 33 years old and was looking for something new. My skin was looking dull. 

After only 4 days of using this product in the AM and PM, my skin has had a noticeable glow and plumpness to it. 

I can not rave enough! 10/10! * I love this stuff. I'm nit a big product junkie. I'm getting older and ciuld never really find affordable products to help my combination, sensitive skin.
This stuff is great. Idk what made me try it, but I'm so happy i did. I always get compliments when i remember to put it on. * I love how nourishing it feels.I have very sensitive skin and it has been working great.There's a tiny bit of a smell but not enough to bother me or keep me from buying it again, which I will be doing. * I've only used it three times so far, but it's extremely moisturizing. I have very sensitive skin so I've given it three days between uses. I usually put it on right before bed but tonight I had a couple hours and touched my face and this stuff pills like crazy. That's my only complaint, though * I wanted to love this,  but the chemical smell i can't do. Also, i dont like the fact its recommended to use at night only. I want a moisturizer that works for both day and night personally. Going back to true belief aqua bomb. * I usually don't leave reviews, but this cream is everything! I've been using it for several months now but I noticed a difference in my skin within the same week. I have very oily VERY acne prone skin with some scarring, and since I've been using this cream I've had minimal break outs which is a huge deal for me. I alternate it with Dime's blue facial oil and my skin has seriously never looked this good. I can't rave about this product and Dime skincare enough, this cream is a must-have!!!"

Like the most old-fashioned, cheap perfume. This is meant to be a day cream… I don't know why it smells so incredibly strong and cheap.  I also think I mistook Ulta's ""conscious beauty"" as meaning clean/good skincare.  But that is not what this is. Its full of synthetic/artificial crap… including dyes and fragrance. * I was really excited to try this cream and the first few days it was perfectly fine, until my face started to breakout really bad and still have some scars :( * This has become my go to moisturizer, it has helped with my pores and fine lines alot. I'm 52 but still get oily in my T-Zone. I am surprised by the negative reviews. Its a winner in my book * I wouldn't recommend this product for women in their late 20s-30s. Its more meant for women in their 40-50s I believe. It was too harsh on my skin. Made my cheeks have a red pigmentmentation and sometimes burned. I dont use it everyday because of it which is ashame because of the price. * I received a Clarins set as a bonus with purchase.  I first tried this products.  The fragtance is so strong snd overwhelming thst my eyes became irritated.  I am not usually sensitive to anything.  Clarins, you do. It beed to add this much fragrance.  I am afraid it might keep me from sleeping. * I used the old formulation and loved it very much. But this new formulation is heavy and makes my face feel greasy.

I dont have oily nor dry skin, I glow with this sunscreen on, i put it on before my makeup and it hasnt messed with the application. It doesnt clear my skin, but i dont break out from this product. I burn easily, yet I lathered up in this sunscreen ONE TIME in the morning during a very hot summer, laying exposed under the sun all day at the beach without reapplying and i left with no burn lines or nothing. However, Im unsure about how water resistant it is. The sunscreen is easy to apply, it rubs in so smoothly. Id recommend buying in store because when I ordered online once, the seal was leaking and i had to exchange it, so i would not risk it. While i do wish this was a bit cheaper for the amount of product i get, i havent bought from another brand since i got on this once. On top of that, i love the fragrance of it, it doesnt have that typical sunscreen smell to it which is a bonus. Overall, i havent had an unpleasant experience with this product so far! * This is the best everyday sunscreen and moisturizer you can use.I have a mature skin and my skin glows from this, I have worked as a medical iaesthetician and I would recommend this to everyone.. * I had tried before form a friend and had seen really good reviews.I finally decide to purchase and plan to do so feels so light weight and it melt into skin so easily there is no shine or sticky feeling like other products I have used and have not noticed and white spots * This completely changed my kids adversity to sunscreen. They will happily apply and re-apply this like any other moisturizer. My husband also doesnt mind reapply this even at work. I took my most recent jug on a bachelorette trip and we all left glowing without sunburning. * Really happy with this sunscreen so far! Usually my least favorite part about sunscreen is how oily and greasy I feel and look, but this one dries/absorbs really nicely so I do not look like I am shining/oily from the sunscreen layer.  I also haven't had any issues with staining on clothes, which I have had issues with other sunscreens. * This sunscreen is fantastic! Unlike most sunscreens, this one doesn't have a white cast and it doesn't feel sticky. It's expensive but definitely worth the price."

Sooths my skin, leaves my skin feeling so nice. Almost everything annoys my skin, these two

I purchased the redness relief calming cream in the past and adored it but wanted something lighter as I have combination skin and this is perfect. Its a soft light moisturizer that doesnt leave me greasy or oily. Its also a fantastic moistuizing base for makeup, will certainly be repurchasing! * I've been on the hunt for a light, hydrating moisturizer since my favorite brand was discontinued, and this one ticks all my boxes. It applies smooth, absorbs fast and leaves my skin soft and happy. I do wish they had a light scent option. * this was one of my favorite moisturizers but it seems to have been reformulated. it's a lot more runny than I remember. I'm assuming it has a lot more water than the last time I've used it, which is annoying enough but it's really hard to apply now because it immediately starts running off of my fingertip * its just so good, hydrates and leaves my skin so soft without being too heavy. its perfect !!!! * I've been using this for a month now and so far, I'm loving it! It's got clean ingredients and hasn't caused any breakouts on my oily / dry combination skin. * I personally prefer this over the cosrx snail musin moisturizer. To be honest it's all up to ones preference. Neither of these products are bad, they're just made for different people. I find that this lotion paste like texture isn't too heavy, yet it doesn't absorb too fast. Compared to the cosrx snail musin moisturizer, which has a gel texture and absorbs too fast. My skin sucks it up super fast, and it's left with no benefits. In comparasent, the peach slices moisturizer leaves my skin soft and smooth. I keep on wanting to touch my face lol. I have oily skin, and I've worn this during the day. It's not horribly heavy to the point it interacts bad with my face oils. I feel as if my t zone has been pretty tame ever since I started using this product. * I use adapelene so my skin easily gets sensitive and when it does every moisturizer (CeraVe, Vanicream, Kiehl's) leaves a burning feeling EXCEPT this one. The texture isn't as luxurious as Kiehl's, but it still spreads easily and sinks in well. Fellow dry skin folks will likely need additional hydrating layers because it's not that moisturizing alone. But for the price and reliability, it's an awesome product! I think it's the centella in it that really helps my skin"

Firstly, it's a gel and not a cream and that should have been my first clue. It applied it and while it went on smooth, that was not the ending result. My face feels like I'm wearing a mask of sorts and my skin does not feel hydrated at all. It feels like a dry cast and during these often dry fall/winter months this is NOT what I need for my skin. 0/10 would not recommend. * works well for my combo skin in the summer.  makes my skin look healthy and hydrated and not oily which i love. the only con is that it is a little sticky on the face, but it's not super bothersome. * This is the best moisturizer for those with oily skin! I work in a hospital and this is the only moisturizer that has been able to keep my oil at bay to reduce breakouts without drying out my skin. It probably wouldn't work for those with normal and dry skin. I do have normal patches around my eyes so I use the Derma-E Skin Restore Advanced Peptides at night. Together, these are a dream team for those who want beautifully moisturized but not too oily skin that work in a hospital! 
For refernce, I have oily, acne-prone skin. I use Derma-E Acne Deep Pore Cleansing face cleanser, The Ordinary's niacinamide serum, and this moisturizer for day time plus the Derma-E moisturizer mentioned above at night time. With this combo, I have minimal acne only around where hospital masks, hairnets, etc touch. * terrible for dry skin-it made me feel even drier after application. 
pills under makeup-my lightweight foundation looked awful when paired with this moisturizer.
It also made my face red and I was very aware of it, if that makes sense. I couldn't wait to wash it off. 
I gave it to my husband who has oily skin and he seems to be having better luck. * Very moisturizing and makes my skin feel so hydrated * I live in a very humid place and dont want a thick moisturizer. This one is perfect! I notice a difference in one day that my skin feels softer and smoother and I think it really does repair the skin barrier quickly!

It so moisturizing my skin, smells so good, and feel good on skin! * The texture is very watery and gel like snd jist slides around and is very sticky. Dont like it. Wouldnt even use it on the rest of my legs like i do with face products i dont like lol. 

My husband also tried it, hated it. Thought it would be a good dupe but it wasnt * It's very affordable and works very nicely! * I absolutely love this moisturizer. I prefer gel to cream moisturizers, they work better for my oily skin."

The only complaint i have about it is the low SPF. It will definitely not help you in the sun but other than that GREAT PRODUCT💗 * Every time I wear it, it peels off even with nothing else on it and it smells to much like sunscreen if you want an alternative i suggest the cera ve sunscreen * my skin is very sensitive to certain sunscreens and will breakout or get tinny little bumps BUT NOT W THIS. literally life saving. * This is my favorite product I have it slides on like silk it's very lightweight and and it feels creamy on my skin the it makes my skin feel make this product number one I would definitely recommend if your looking for a good sunscreen this is the one * Decent on its own but pills terribly under makeup * This worked for a while and then all of a sudden it started to peel anytime I used. If you put any type of serum or moisturizer under it it will immediately start to rub off"

Omg! What a difference. The redness in my cheeks and by the corners of my nose went away. And my skin looked immediately brighter. The feel of the creme itself is SO luxurious and you only need a little bit so it will last a longer time (of course we want that with this price lol) * I love this product and ordered it online for a mother's day gift. However, I somehow got a refill, so it came in a plastic container with a tear-away foil cover and no jar. I didn't even know refills existed for this. I didn't have a container to place it in (other than using a cheap Ziploc bag), so it would have dried out. Hence, I had to return it. I'm not sure if others have had this issue, but Ulta, please be aware! * Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo my mom is a dermatologist and she loves it!!!!!!!! * I have been using this cream for about a month and a half. It feels pleasant and smells beautiful, but does not live up to its claims in my experience. My face does not feel fully hydrated by the end of the day, never mind 24 hours. I have not witnessed brightening or firming. A big selling point (and likely excuse for the huge price tag) is the Grand Rose extract, which Lancôme does a poor job explaining the benefit of. Luckily I had Ulta points to use on this cream, and not my own money. I got roped into the illusion of grandeur and prestige with this Absolue cream. Don't be like me. Much more effective and affordable creams are available on the market. Research ingredients; rose extract offers unremarkable and lackluster benefits. Perhaps the Pro-Xylane and shea butter can, but certainly not in this formulation. * This product is amazing! Expensive as heck but amazing. I originally tried this as a sample and noticed a difference from just the sample. My skin has NEVER felt so soft and smooth! Make sure to purchase when there's a 20% off code otherwise it's a lot. * Most say ""it softens the skin""  Goodness ladies, you can ""soften skin"" with products that are free of chemicals and work to soften.. A cream at this ridiculous price should do more than ""SOFTEN"".. I received a teeny tiny sample of it .. Sorry I don't believe one can see any difference whatsoever with 4 drops of a cream with a strong perfume smell.  I have sensitive skin and perfume is not something I want in a cream * Got sample with other Lancôme product. Best moisturizer on market. Cant tell u how many compliments I have received.

I feel perfectly hydrated without being weighed down. * Bought the full-size jar after receiving a sample. It's a nice weight without feeling heavy or greasy. Light, pleasant scent. I use it after washing my face at night. Provides ample moisture and skin smoothing and plumping overnight. * Hi Everyone!

So, I very rarely write reviews but this product deserves one. I've been using this product for a little over a week now and it's saved my skin. A little bit about me and my skin concerns: I'm 38, latina with tan skin, no wrinkles but a few fine lines around the corners of my lips. I struggle with eczema on my eyebrows, around my nose and chin. When I started using this cream, I had been dealing with a flare up that was into its 2nd week. 😫 I applied this the same night that I picked it up. Immediately, I noticed the lemony scent and silky feel on my skin. I had no stinging or burning. The next morning, MY FACE WAS CLEAR. No patches, no angry flare up. My skin was glowing and supple. It's been very hot in NJ and I've even used this twice a day with no adverse reaction. My skin looks so much better and that makes me happy. Thank you fresh for this amazing product. I love it. 🩷 * I really wanted to like this, as I tried the lotus day cream in the past and loved it! This time, I got this in the gift set from Ulta (the one you get with minimum purchase), and I am happy I didn't purchase the full size. The cream has a nice texture and smell but it made me break out terribly!!! I definitely wouldn't recommend to sensitive acne prone skin people. Very disappointing. * I have years using this cream. Ordered new one, when I applied it I did noticed the smell was different, I thought was expired. Looks like lots of customers are complaining about a formula changed ? So sad, now I have to find a replacement brand. * This became my new favorite lotion so quick! Super moisturizing but feels light still. Has the best smell ever (not too strong). Highly recommend! * i made the mistake of not doing a patch test. my face broke out from this really bad. it also has a weird strong fruity fragrance??"

This product offers hydration relief effectively 90% of the time.  When the Santa Ana winds blow, nothing will help.  I'm on my 4th bottle I like it that much!! * Recieved a sample and used on my seriously purging skin. It never irritating my sensitive skin and actually felt soothing. It took hours to ansorb into my skin and left a slightly greasy feel. I awoke this morning to very happy skin - hydrated, smooth, plump and slightly firmer. Once my current moisturizer is empty, I'll be purchasing. * This is my second time repurchasing. I hate the price but this has made a significant difference in my skin. I have sensitive dry skin and this has given my skin the moisture it needs and an amazing glow. I see others are complaining about it being ""greasy"" i havent had that issue. I apply two pumps to my skin and it gives me the most beautiful glow. I use everything Dermalogica and constantly get compliments on my skin. * This is one of those products that's been life changing in my routine. The way my under eyes look & feels from this product is phenomenal. This has helped with my fine lines and wrinkles. Helped firm my under eyes. Super rich lux formula. A little goes a long way. It awakens my under eyes. * I need moisture, not grease.  So sad. I will be going back to my Drunk Elephant. * Oooof..big fan of Dermalogica but not of this. Leaves an awful oily residue and film on skin; running, not walking to return. * Does not absorb well. Face remains shiny and the product just sits on your skin. I did not see a reduction in wrinkles and I used it for almost 3 months 2x/day."

I use maybe 2-3 pea size amounts once a day at night. Redness went down with this one more than it did with the redness releif product from peach slices, so i think my skin just needed a break. The bottle doesnt last very long (around 3 months which is quite short for me, as I am a student and dont want to spend $60 a year on mosturizer lol). My last 2 bottles I noticed that overtime, if there is a little bit of product left on the tip, the packaging will degrade and the cap wont be able to turn back on. The ridges where the cap is usually secured comes off, so there is not air tight seal. Other than that, i love the product, the packaging not so much. Due to this reason, i will be looking for a new mosturizer. If you really want to try it out though, I recommend storing it upside down and wiping the cap with a clean towel regularly. I dont like doing this though because i dont like to touch the applicators of my products. * I recently got this moisturizer more than a week ago at my local Ulta store.i wanted to try something new and more affordablle for me.A few days later i started having the worst breakouts ive had in a while and my skin has been drier and flaky.This is definitely  not for my combo/oilly acne prone skin.do your research before you by this. * I was looking around ulta in store for a moisturizer and an employee came to help and recommended this. I would recommend this brand in general due to the gold ingredients. It is a very good moisturizer to keep my acne in check. * This product caused me to get little red dots on my face and caused breakouts. * This product caused me to get little red dots on my face and caused breakouts. * I have dry skin, and am allergic to some ingredients in skincare. This one at first seemed like it wasn't good for me because it'd cause my skin to tingle, but after some time it did perfectly in cleaning my face AND removing my makeup. It makes my skin feel refreshed and tighter. I use it to clean my brushes and sponges, it works perfectly everytime. If you're new to skincare, definitely give it a shot. * i bought this moisturizer because i have very oily acne prone skin and i heard it was good for my skin type. but this product is hardly even a moisturizer it feels like a serum, is super watery, and it makes me feel and look so oily. definitely going go return it, i wouldn't recommend this to anybody"

Well, this must have been an old sample since I saw other comments about their formula change. This version made me break out in hives and was very itchy. Have to return. So sad because the old version was awesome. * I really like this! I am out of my first jar and will be buying another one this week! Try it! It's not greasy and has a very nice feel! * I wanted to try something different and this just wasn't for me.  It's very greasy and doesn't absorb and it made me itch terribly * I'd give it 5 stars if the price went a bit lower. I aways have to wait for a coupon to come, its expensive for a bit over an ounce.

-a faithful customer- * I tend to avoid creams that have fragrence in this and this one tends to sting over cuts & dry skin in very fresh states. Other than that I love the feeling of the lotion once applies (I have a mini fridge for my cream) but I just don't appreciate that feeling around sensitive skin cells. * I am so disappointed in the formula change :( I ordered a new jar and knew immediately after rubbing it on that something was off. It's almost soapy and doesn't seem to rub in like before. It leaves a bit of white residue too. I've been loyal to this moisturizer for so many years. My skin is not doing well and I'm worried I've developed a bit of an allergic reaction which is actually how I originally came to find this moisturizer. I am so saddened to have to now search for another moisturizer when my skin doesn't do well with most creams. This used to feel luxurious and almost silky. Not anymore!"

It's also giving the healthy skin look .

So far I'm liking it, it goes on smoothly and doesn't feel sticky. * I love the sleek, black packaging. However, I do not understand all the good reviews.  I have extremely oily skin, and this ""dewy"" cream made my skin very dry and tight every time I used it. I very much prefer the dewy skin cream from Tatcha. * Im almost done with it and can say that im disappointed it was not hydrating. I put a good amount too to make sure and nothing. I really liked the toner so i wanted to try the day cream but i honestly didnt like it. For the price you could spend the same or spend a little more and get a better product * I've tried many many moisturizers over the years ranging from $45-$200 and this one is my absolute favorite! It'll be the one i get from hear on out. Im 49 and in my llayer year have experienced dry skin. Which looks like old skin . But this moisturizer is so good my skin looks younger! * I recently had almost a chapped texture to my skin I'm not really sure why but this cream is so hydrating it took care of all the issues I was having. A little goes such a long way. I have pretty sensitive/combination skin. * Received a GWP sample from Ulta.

Opened to use and it has blooms of mold spores!

Yikes.

The product was never opened and never used. Promptly went into the trash * I got this as a freevie and thank God it was a freebie. 0/10. If by dewy they mean greasy, then yes! I have normal-sometimes dry skin and I used it on a ""dryer"" day, it felt really gross and warm on my face. Very similar to vaseline. Thick and very difficult to wash hands after. Oil stains on my wash towel. I didn't have the red and blotchy allergic reactions like a lot of the other receiws, but this is glorified vaseline."

I had to wash it off after a minute * I absolutely love this skincare product. It has helped my skin greatly ! I've had many compliments since using this product! * Disappointed. I don't have a lot of extra money so something of this price is a splurge for me. I literally had to press the pump like 6 times to get any to come out. I thought it may have been because it's new. But the next 2 times I've had to press the pump like 10 times to get an Itty bitty amount to come out. Even shaking it, it feels empty. I don't live near a local store so I guess I'm just out that $$$. It does feel nice, the little bit I got out but can't get enough to use on my whole face. * This stuff is great if it's literally the only thing going on your face after cleansing, but otherwise it gums up and pills. For the price it's too finicky. * This is the first product that has visibly improved my skin in years  (I'm 55 years old).  My skin is visibly brighter.  I like the texture of it.  It absorbs nicely and has no smell.  And yes, it slightly burns when putting it on.  For me, it is a very minor burn and reminds me of what it was like when I first started using vitamin  C over 25 years ago.  The only complaint I have is that I've experienced pilling with it. I think I can fix that by changing some things with my routine. This product is better than many I've paid twice the price for in the past.  But definitely not for sensitive skin!"

As soon as I opened the packaging, I was hit with the aggressive smell of this product and was transported back to my grandmother applying her heavily scented products in my youth. Since I had no other moisturizer with me, I used it and my combo acne prone skin informed me that I had offended it with the noxiously scented product. My skin was irritated and my husband, who has the worst sense of smell ever, could smell this product through a couple layers of product.

So needless to say, I do not recommend this product. * I had a bad experience with this cream. I have used this brand for many years because its products are made with high-quality ingredients, and it always tries to take care of the skin. But this cream, besides having a horrible and extremely strong smell, filled my face with pimples, made me look like a teenager, and dried out some areas of my face. It was a total disappointment. * loved the way it made my skin feel
but can't get past the strong fragrance * The texture of the cream is very light. I like how it applies smoothly on the skin. But it has a strong baby powder smell and it makes my skin look so greasy after a while. * Love this lightweight moisturizing gel cream. Also my husband always gives me compliments when he kisses my cheek because he loves the clean fresh scent of this cream. * I use several Avene products. I sometimes can't wait for this step in my skincare routine. I just love how good it feels going on.  It locks in moisture without feeling oily, too thick or too heavy. * This gel moisturizer seeps into the skin nicely, a little goes a long way. I have eczema, when it was super raw this did sting a little. The baby powder smell is OK, didn't bother me and I didn't love it either. This gentle yet effective for dry skin days. I love that it's non-comodogenic, for reference I have oily/dry combo skin that is acne prone."

I feel so much more confident as a 24 yo in my aging skin. Gentle and effective. Love avene products! Just the best * Let me start off saying I really DO like this! I have 36yo DRY skin and I was getting a little peeling and dry patches from my Rx Tret. once a week, but had zero irritation using this every night! It's a pretty thick cream consistency so not the easiest to spread on its own IMO. I like to use a serum before this Retrinal .5% to help it glide on the skin easier. One pump usually does it, but sometimes I add just a tiny bit more if I feel like I didn't get even coverage. It's definitely a long term product so don't expect immediate results. I DO wish Ulta carried the 1.0 version of this instead of just the .5%. * I just bought this product and I am loving it. I can't speak on results yet but as someone with oily/acne prone  skin, I feel like I finally found an anti-aging product that absorbs well and doesn't break me out. It may feel slightly ""heavy"" at first but it absorbs. Great for sensitive skin, as well! So happy I found this brand * I tried a couple of retinal creams, and had breakouts and/or burning. Having used many Avene products with great results, I took their skin quiz online, and this product was recommended. It is a great alternative to retinol, at a very low dosage so you can start to build use. I've had great success with it, and it is helping with fine lines around my eyes. I can use it every night with absolutely no irritation."

I ordered the moisturizer and it is not the same at all. My face started stinging and itching after the second use and it doesnt go on as smooth. * i loved this product for so long, but didnt realize that it what was breaking me out. i tried a different cleanser, added an exfoliater etc. NOTHING would get rid of the harsh bumps all over my face. not until i researched and found out it had safflower it in which (can) support fungal acne. i have dry, sensitive acneic skin so this may work for others but definitely not for me. very disappointed and wish i found out sooner. not even 3 days after stopping this product, my skin is clearing up. * I used to be a big fan of the Superscreen Daily Moisturizer, and although they kept the packaging the same, they changed the formula and the name to Superscreen Hydrating Daily Cream. I think brands should be more transparent about informing their customers that they're actually buying a different product than what they're used to. The consistency of the new cream is thicker and harder to spread, but what stands out the most to me is the smell: somewhere in between Play-Doh and generic baby sunscreen. My partner has sensitive skin around his eyes, and the old formula didn't cause him any burning, but the new one does. I wouldn't buy this again. * I bought this because it had avobenzone but no octocrylene (at the time). Great texture but I reacted badly to something in it. Guessing it was the algae because I've used the other ingredients before without issue. * DO NOT BUY new formula is horrible. Not the same product whatsoever. Why ruin a great product everyone loved?? Makes no sense. Ive gone through at least 10 of these moisturizers and now i will no longer purchase. And the new scent is a crime against humanity. * This used to be SOOOO awesome.  Now my face oily by 10 am and feels very irritated.  Also broke me out for the first time in a while.  Had zero issues with the old formula.  I really hope they change it back * What a great and rich sunscreen! The texture of this is super rich and hydrating while feeling so comfortable on my skin. I love that it doesn't leave a white film over my skin, it just soaks right in. Gifted by Supergoop"

I was recommended by my esti to try another brand, but it was just too expensive to continue so I decided to go back to the Neutrogena. Sadly, the formula has been changed, and it is not at all what I experienced previously. I am not experiencing the redness and irritation that others are reporting, but my skin is not moisturized and looks dry and lifeless. My search for a new product begins. * Horrible. This new formula is simply horrible. It dries out my skin, makes it irritated, and leaves a weird greasy film. It pills like crazy and makes my skin horrible. I miss the old formula! It was perfect and always made my skin feel plump and soft. I swtiched to a higher end brand which is working now how this old neutrogena formula used to. Im incredibly disappointed in neutrogena and this product. * I used this product once and my skin immediately turned bright red and started burning/ felt hot. I washed my face immediately but the redness and irritation lingered. I came to the reviews to see if other people shared this problem and I was shocked to read so many people had the same reaction.

I also wonder if this product formulation is incorrect and needs to be recalled if this many people are reacting poorly. * I have sensitive and dry skin. The old formula was really soothing and hydrating. Now whenever I use it my face begins to burn and turn red. I do not think I have seen so much irritation in my face and neck ever. * I have worn the hydroboost creme (not water gel) for years. This new formula feels more oily than the old and I have to almost scoop it out and use more than the old formula. It doesn't have the same texture and smoothness. It just isn't the same. Also, much smaller container for same or more cost. So disappointed in this new formula. Really hope they will bring back the gel creme. * Love the texture and I was hoping it would be a suitable new nighttime moisturizer for me however my face breaks out when I use it. I will go back to what works for me (Cerave PM.) * Tried many products that irritated my skin. Thought I'd try this one even though it is targeted to younger skin.
It is wonderful for my 60 year old skin."

I LOVE IT!!! It blends GREAT (especially for a product with SPF), isn't greasy, doesn't make my skin oily or shiny, has not caused a breakout, and I can see a clear difference in the moisture level of my skin in just a few days. Anti-aging creams normally make my skin totally freak out, but this one is all good, no bad. Really glad I happened upon it! * This contains Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene....FYI * I joke that this is my old lady face cream because it smells like a bouquet of roses. However, it really does give the skin a lifted appearance and tightened feel. The daytime version has some SPF and wears nice under makeup. I wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin because of the fragrance. Also, I noticed on very dry winter days the product does not have enough moisture for my skin * I received this as a sample size from Estee Lauder and I can't wait to buy a full size. This is why I love samples, It lets me fiind out what I love without spending a fortune first.  It has the faintest fragrance that is subtle but lovely. It goes on so smooth and is just pleasant to use. My only complaint is the price. Some of us would buy this brand more often if we weren't priced out of the market. This is why I gave it a four. Otherwise, a five all the way. * This smells like febreeze and it doesn't go away when you rub it in :( save your monies * I use this product daily.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. It did not irritate my skin, which can sometimes be an issue for me.  Makeup base glides on smoothly over this moisturizer.  It is my absolute favorite. * I wish I could use this product as it seems to work well. However the fragrance is too strong and irritating."

I can truly say that this stuff along with the face and eye serum works. I used to have very dry skin, but not anymore. Also, the hormonal acne I get occasionally is under control. Lastly, the wrinkles are diminishing. Totally worth every penny. * I see smoother skin , brighter skin , less fine lines and an overall younger look * I do love this product, it's true to all things advertised - A little bit goes a long way as I purchased this a few months ago and still have more than half of it left. I did not want to write a review until I was certain I was satisfied based off of the huge expense...

I have very dark circles around my eyes and I was thinking this product would help with that. Unfortunately when i put it on, it makes the skin around my eyes buuuurrrrn. My eyes also arent that much more moisturized for such a thick cream. If you have sensetive skin, dont buy, its burns and is too expensive to try. 

Also, the deeper i dug, the more reviews i found that were written by people who were traded the product for free in return for a product review. Should have done more research…. * It makes my skin feel so soft, without being greasy at all, and makeup easily goes on over it. Only a small amount goes a long way * I am in love with this line, specifically this face cream and the eye cream. I have gone through two jars so far. I also use it on my neck and have noticed more of a difference there than on my face regarding tightening of skin. The cream is fairly light on the skin and is deeply hydrating. I ran out for a week and noticed an immediate difference! It can be a little shiny when combined with sunscreen and makeup however at night it just makes my skin glow. I am 48 and starting to battle some hormonal acne around my chin and mouth area so I have to avoid putting the cream around those areas. If I cant help myself (because it feels so good) I just get a few microscopic whiteheads that go away by the next day. * I love this cream. It feels so smooth. Going on. Has a beautiful texture. I noticed my skin is very vibrant after I use it. * This is so good! I went out on a whim and bought it and im glad i did. My skin really likes it, and even though my skin usually hates new products, its stayed clear with this! The smell is nice and spa-like and it's a pleasant experience using it. It's very hydrating too! Can't speak much for wrinkles but it makes my skin look healthier! * For the price point, I was disappointed in the moisture this product provided. I only purchased it to try it out because it was on sale but I would not repurchase and I would not buy full price. It also smells weird, I know fresh typically uses fragrance in their products but it doesn't smell great. * I''ve used this cream for 2 weeks and think it's a keeper."

Have used it a couple years now.  Non-reactive on my sensitive skin and feels wonderful on.  I believe it has made a difference in the texture of my skin and improved my neck wrinkles. * Finding the right skin care routine is never linear since it varies person per person. I have sensitive combination skin and I always struggled to find a product that didnt give me that greasy glow. 

This product is light yet hydrating enough that it doesnt require a lot of product. While the price tad is high, the big container last me 2-3 months depending on the weather. 

I would recommend you get a sampler size and try it out for 3 months because you wont see any instant results. After 6 months of using this product, it cleared my blackhead and slowly seeing results in other areas. * I have been using this multi corrective face cream since its arrived on the market, Im 52, it has been a game changer since i traded up from their daily moisturizer( in which i stared at 30. It doing what it needs to do, im not getting wrinkles or dry skin and i use it alone & under make up. I'm often asked if im 35 so i have to give some credit to kehls for it. I love the line, its fine quality and i will never waver! * I bought this after many great reviews. I used it around 10 times and thought it was sunburn because I was red and sore. I switched to e45 then another brand and I was fine. I then tried it again after a couple of weeks and it stung my face again! I usually don't have sensitive skin and I'm gutted I spent so much and now can't use it * Every single thing on my face 'balls up' when I use this moisturizer, including when I use it alone.  It does not absorb into my skin, but just sits on top. I've tried it in so many combinations and it's just incompatible with other skin care and foundations (I've tried several foundations -high end & low end- with same results).  I've also tried using it with serums, different primers, different sunscreens and alone with the same result. This is a hard pass for me. * In my early adulthood i had terrible acne and skin probs. I tried proactive and everything at the drugstore, nothing worked. I found Kiehl's and my skin turned right around and I've never had a problem since. Im willing to pay for good skin care, but this price still hurts. My skin would feel waxy and really greasy for a long time which aggravated my pores, which in turn aggravated me. It doesnt feel moisturizing at all. I feel like i just wasted a lot of money. Kiehl's let me down for the first time : ("

This and the gel do help with my dark marks and acne thats not hormonal but the pilling bothers me so bad. * I've used this for over a year and its a holy grail for acne prone skin. I usually have oily/combo skin and use this moisturizer under Matte Super Goop sunscreen. I haven't had any acne in soo long! I live in a high humidity area and it works great! * After applying other serums or makeup this product began to peel off my skin. * I have cystic and acne and everytning makes me break out but this didn't. I wouldn't say it helped my acne any, but i didn't break out bad and that's what i'm looking for :) the pump is awful though, barely works, wish it came in a different container. * i love this product but most of the bottle is air and only filled around halfway with the product. it is a wonderful product to help ease your acne but you definitely need to be willing to pay a lot for it and the select amount that you will get from the bottle * After two or three uses my entire face became red where I had applied it. Cannot figure out which ingredient i would be allergic to. Put Cortizone and neosporin all over my face to calm it down. * Just seemed it wasn't worth the money. It didn't last all that long.

It makes me look so pale. I am so surprised given the price and the fact it is supposed to be a ""daily moisturizer."" Would not waste your money. * I loved the fact that it had hyaluronic acid and SPF in one, but after putting it on, I realize it's definitely not for me. I hoped the reviews were wrong, but it definitely leaves a white cast over your skin, and made me look super pale, despite the fact that I have a fair, medium skin tone. * I have tried almost every mineral sunscreen under the sun. I'm fair skin, freckles, burn easily, break out easily and this sunscreen moisturizer has been amazing. There is a white cast initially but I rub the product between my fingers before applying and it blends within 5 minutes! I never get sunburn on my face while wearing this.

I love that it is fragrance free as well. * The original Neutrogena water gel mositruizer didn't work for me because of the fragrance. I'm very happy to see this mositurizer in a fragrance free version! This is a great moisturizer  for oily, sensitive skin. Its provides great hydration and is lightweight, non-irritating, non-comedogenic, and affordable.

Sadly, I have do go on another quest to find another moisturizer that works for my skin. * NO WAY. IT'S THE SMALL CONTAINER FOR $1 LESS THAN 1.7 OZ.
Don't buy this size at this price. Look around * V happy with this! I was super p.o about them changing the formula of the Hydroboost Extra Dry gel (now the Hydroboost water cream) I was using because it's the only thing that worked for me. That one has *horrid* reviews now about being too heavy and acne causing. This is perfect and I would consider it the same product as the old one I liked. Glad I went with this instead of the other one. I have dry, sensitive skin and this moisturized and kept me smooth with no breakouts. * I wanted to like this, but I miss the old formula/extra dry gel cream. The old cream was like a drink for my face and my skin looked amazing. This new formula feels sticky and oily. I do not like it and hate when companies change something that isn't messed up.

It works great with my various varieties of sunscreen, and I've never loved how great my skin looks so much. HIGHLY RECOMMEND * So far I love this product. Gives my face a fresh glow and moisture during this cold weather. I'm not sure if it would be great in the summer. The only issue is that you must dry your skin thoroughly. For some odd reason the texture of the cream changes if there's a hint of water on the skin. * I have very dry skin, and have tried and used over 50 face moisturizers, and this is one of the worst ones. It is SO thick and does not sink into the skin, it feels like its just sitting on top of your skin almost like sunscreen. I REALLY wanted to give it a fair try so I tried it as an overnight moisturizer, and when I woke up my skin did not feel moisturized. * I wanted to try this because it's made with clean ingredients, and ended up being disappointed by it. It left my face feeling oily in some places, and sticky all over. * I absolutely adore this moisturizer! I started using it a year or two ago and I've gone through multiple jars. It's lightweight and the texture is amazing. Starts off as a cream but then it disperses and feels like water on your skin.

I noticed that everytime I tried the product again, the roseacea would reactivate.

I know it has worked for others but my experience was not good. If you have sensitive skin, I dont recommend you this product. * Started working 15 mins after I applied it.  Next morning almost all of the redness gone.  Have a little more clearing up of the bumps but nothing works in a day.  Def recommend. * Pricey but effective- helped with my rosacea right away - I purchased a travel size cleanser   To try and my skin has cleared up less than a week . I have already been using the moisturizer which noticeably improved my dry skin * I used La Roche posay Vit C serum and followed it by this moisturizer. my face burned and the following afternoon, I had red patches on my patches and couldn't stretch of smile. it was painful * I got this to try to tone down my rosy cheeks and this cream absolutely made me redder AND added a burning sensation to my already sensitive skin. This does not moisturize and is more of a thick green paste that makes your make up look bad too. Yikes * This lotion is ok. I realized after buying and using that la roche posay is not a cruelty free line.

Unlike the cleanser which is light, smells great and leaves skin feeling fresh, this moisturizer is thick, feels heavy on your face, and smells like artificial fruit.

I'm so happy I gave it a try. * Though I do love the way this lotion feels on my skin, I won't purchase this again unless the packaging changes. It feels cheap and only works about 2/3 of the time.

Anyway, I can wear this sunscreen alone. Makes my skin glow so I feel comfortable skipping foundation 😌 * This is my first time working with an spf moisturizer, and honestly I think it does fine. I have oily + acne prone skin so moisturizers are a hit or miss, my only problem with this is that it does take a bit longer to absorb than I would like, but once it sinks in it's perfectly fine. * This is my first time trying these products.

When I tell you I put this on my cheeks, and it was literally like wearing a different face, omg guys I mean it. Nothing and I mean NOTHING compares to this. This will be a must have in my purse, and it didn't budge with a crying session either! 😩😩😩😍😍😍 * I loved this within the first few weeks of use, but over the past 2-3 months it hasn't been of use for me. Boring, but also doesn't work for those who have heavily visible acne, so on my bad days it was REALLY bad. * I have suffered on and off with perioral dermatitis since the nightmare days of the c—-d masks. I have tried almost every remedy over the counter, prescription, and people's own testimonial remedies. Finally this product has completely helped in disguising and healing this embarrassing facial rash. Bravo to Hero balm * Did take out most of the red, but burned my skin. Returned the product. * I really thought this product was working for my healing acne and treating the redness but now i have noticed that it gives me acne. It does take a good amount of product to treat the redness and it pills easily. Ive tried not using it and ive noticed my acne spots are healing much faster without it. So it may take care of the redness but messes up the skin texture and gives me acne * Im not the biggest fan of face makeup so i thought this would be a great 2 in 1 to cover and heal any blemishes. Tried it and absolutely fell in love. This product has been so good to me. The tint can be a lil dark or light for some skin tones but as nuetral/yellow olive tone its been awesome!"

This is dewy and hydrating without breaking me out. My skin is less red and smoother after using this. Love it! * I absolutely love this moisturizer! It's light & feels very hydrating. I love the dewy finish on my skin, but I wouldn't recommend for oily girls. This has Propolis at the very top of the ingredient list, so you know you're getting all the benefits for an affordable price. Not to mention it's fragrance free! I pair this with a peptide eye cream & it has diminished my fine lines * In lieu of my 5 star rating, this product sadly ended up in my ""can't use"" category. I absolutely loved EVERYTHING about the whole Propolis line, but unforturnately Propolis is an allergen tested during an allergy patch test and mine showed a trace reaction which my allergist informed me to avoid any allergens even if it is only a trace. This could be an issue for people who have sensitive skin. I have to say that other than being a possible irritant or allergy to some, this moisturizer is a really great consistency and lives up to all the expectations that it claims to have. As with any product that is new to your skin, proceed with caution and do a patch test. Its worth knowing :) * I love the toner and serum in this line but for whatever reason this lotion is just waaay too much for me. It would irritate my exzema and cause small/minor breakouts. I have dry/reactive/acne prone skin so moisturizers are a challenge for me * My skin loves it! My pores look smooth, its calming & hydrating without looking greasy. A little goes a long way. * I LOVE THIS! My skin took around a week to really settle into this as my face reacts to new things. However once i got into the routine of using this, my pores look smooth, my skin is plump, and is overall hydrating without looking greasy. It also calms down the redness I have on my cheeks. A little goes a long way. I finally found a moisturizer that works for me."

I wake up to the most glowing, softest skin ever! It's quite concentrated though, so a little goes a long way. There's no discernible smell. I definitely recommend. * The only reason i gave this product 2 stars is because of the representative who was promoting it, she was amazing!!

As far as this moisturizer (as well as the gold oil) are far from good. It does absolutely zero for my skin personally and my mom agrees as we each got a jar of it to try and at first was impressed…for me, ive tried it every way you can imagine and its not moisturizing at all-in fact my skin feels extremely tight and dry and  actually broke me out and no matter how much or how little i use it leaves a white-ish cast on my face. Ive researched the brand and honestly almost changed my entire skincare regimen to Kooari…thank god i didn't!!! 2/2 products both leaving me more than unimpressed-i think its just safe to say this line is not for me!! I wouldnt recommend it but if you do use Kopari and have good results-stick with it!!! Unfortunately, this is line is a hard no for me. I would never return either product just because it doesnt suit my personal skin needs which is no fault of anyones but its just rude to buy and try and expect the company where its sold or the maker of the product to take the loss. We need to be realistic and accept that when trying new skincare we take a chance… * I received a travel size of this amazing moisturizer in a 25 piece pink makeup bag GWP. 

Kopari doesn't disappoint! I'm very picky with moisturizers, and I 100% approve and recommend the Kopari Moisture Whipped Ceramide Cream. I just turned 47 in November and have gone from oily skin to combo/dry/slightly oily in the T-Zone. While I think this cream is best suited for normal - dry/combo skin, it may be a bit heavy for very oily skin.  I still think that oily skin types can use it as an overnight mask occasionally. 
I love that its fragrance free and all of the ingredients are skin-loving. Its a Big YES from me. 
I ended up purchasing the Kopari 'Dry Skin Savior's ' kit, ($49), which includes a full size of the Moisture Whipped Ceramide Cream, Marine Clean Purifying Gel Cleanser (travel size), & Niacinamide and Caffeine Eye Bright Cream (full size). Kopari is an amazing brand! I wish Ulta would bring back some of their other products. * My skin has gotten dryer over time (51 yrs) and this moisturizer has filled the gap in my skincare routine. This cream is just as good as products that are twice the price and it wears well under my make up. My skin has never looked better. I use First aid beauty facewash cream then a serum or two like hylauronic acid or niacinimide then this cream. I add an exfoliating pad in a few times a week from Elemis or I'll use an exfoliating toner. my skin is sensitive so I can't exfoliate daily. I often use Fresh Rose toner too after I wash my face but before serums as well.  I don't need any foundation or skin tint. My skin looks amazing. * I absolutely love the Kopari Moisture Whipped Ceramide Cream! The texture is light and fluffy, yet it delivers intense hydration that lasts all day. My skin feels softer and smoother, and it's perfect for my drier skin without feeling greasy. It's also gentle enough for sensitive skin, leaving a healthy, nourished glow. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a moisturizing cream that really works! * The cream is very good and up to now is working good, I need to keep trying the cream for a linger time. * I have tried endless products that either feel like they sit on top of the skin or completely disappear in a second yet my skin still feels like dry. This is hands down the best moisturizer I have used for my extremely dry skin type. I use it every night and I can tell a huge difference."

Leaves your skin glowing and hydrated before foundation * This is the key to flawless makeup! I've used countless moisturizers and primers, and have never been quite happy with how my makeup blended on top. I wish I would have tried this sooner, but it was worth the wait. I have combo skin, and this is so smooth and hydrating, but not heavy or greasy. The smoothness is what makes me love how my foundation blends on top. I like a matte finish foundation, but they tend to be too drying and look dry on my skin. Not anymore! I get the smoothest, most plush looking effect from this moisturizer and my makeup looks better than ever! I highly recommend this! * True to explain, stays on, I see the difference in my skin. * I have noticed a HUGE difference in fine lines! Im 29 and constantly asked if im 22! * Used this product for 4 days, my entire face and neck broke out in a rash. I do not recommend this product to anyone that has sensitive skin. * Im so disappointed!! I wanted so badly to love this and the serum but it just sits on my face and it pills really really bad! Ugh.

Wish I could afford to keep it in stock. * This eye gel is part of my every day beauty routine. A little goes a long way. It's very soothing and moisturizing. It does not settle in pores and it does not pill. I use it before I put on my tinted moisturizer. * Refreshing light citrus scent, cool on the skin, moisturizes without feeling heavy or greasy. * I was looking for cheaper dupe to the 100hr moisture surge from clinique and this was the only other moisturizer that has caffine in it. But the smell was too strong. Says theres essential oil inside but i never break out but i did. Go pay the extra 10 or get moisturizer surge. Also blackfriday and other holidays it goes on sale * I received a sample of this product in a big sample kit and decided to try it out. I had been using The Ordinary Niacinamide + Zinc for the longest time and after trying out the sample there is no going back for me. I had no idea but The Ordinary was causing breakouts which cleared up in a matter of days once switching to this. It makes my skin feel refreshed almost immediately and my skin looks brighter and plumper after just 30 minutes. Normally heavily fragrant products make me break out and cause my face to burn due to my sensitive skin but I have not had this issue at all with this product. It is a refreshing citrus smell which I absolutely LOVE the smell of citrus. After long time use my skin consistently looked brighter and I had less dry skin and fine lines. It is true that it does leave your skin feeling sticky but I always put my moisturizer on top of it and the stickiness is no longer an issue. I highly recommend this product!! * This moisturizer has really leveled up the radiance of my face. I use this as my night cream, and ive been waking up to increasibgly refreshed and energetic skin with each passing day. * My skin has never felt so soft. I also use the scrub so the combination is making my skin look younger and softer!"

I normally love Peach & Lily and use their products almost exclusively, but this one was a fail for me. It smelled bad immediately upon opening - kind of like rancid almond oil. It also caused acne on my otherwise clear skin. It's not breathable, which I think is kind of the point, but I didn't like the way my skin felt after putting it on. * The bottle i got smells bad like old products and i am not sure if it is expired. * The bottle i got smells bad like old products and i am not sure if it is expired. * I love this moisturizer, I use it at night with the matching serum to help calm my skin from redness and irritation which really helps after a long day. It just adds so much moisture to my skin and helps with flakeyness. I like the smell and it's a nice texture not really lightweight it's a bit thicker than that so it can help with moisture since it's a thicker moisturizer. I would definitely recommend this product, im already using a lot of Peach&Lily products. It's my skincare brand, I love the brand and their products. * Was persuaded to buy this brand because of it being vegan and good for ""all types of eczema."" I did try it on my hand first and was fine. However, it caused a severe reaction on my face. As you can see, it is not safe for all type of eczema. * I opened up the second jar I bought and I'm not sure what happened but it smelled rancid !!! This moisturizer does have an odd smell ( I'm guessing from the oatmeal ) but it doesn't linger. I'm pretty sure I got a product that was expired. I won't repurchase * It felt nice on the skin & helped with any itchiness and redness on the face, but shortly after my face felt dry. I would not recommend if you have dry skin or a damaged skin barrier. My face felt
tight no matter how much i put."

I used to love this product because it smelled like a spa. The new formula also does not feel as rich on the skin. This will be my last bottle. Too pricey and it is near impossible to get the last 1/4 of the product out of the jar, * I purchased this cream and overnight cream for my face along with the body lotion ..WELL
They all smell the same overnight and Day facial cream is the same to me 
I spent over $100.00 on two facial products are the same .
won't buy it again * Lightweight, smells great and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. * Ok seriously Ive tried thousands of products over the yeara because i have sensitive ans acne prone skin! Ive been using this every day sometimes twice a day if i rememebr and its kept my skin CLEAR!! Even with the return of rhe mask mandate at work its protected my skin from my ""maskne"" ive had theoughout the pandemic. Would definetlt recomend this. This trial ive used this alone for about a month and a half. * I got a free sample of this product. It is NOT fragrance free. I immediately had to wash my face * This is a really good product for my combination skin. Vey matte and leaves no oily residue. However, they need to change the bottle on this product.

I also like how quickly absorbs into the skin and doesn't have yhat greasy feel after on the tace.  I typically layer this with serums.

It worked very good on my skin. * This is marketed for normal-dry skin but I have combo-oily and my skin drinks this! Also not marketed for my age range (20s), but if you're looking to splurge, this is it! I bought it on a whim as a Beauty Steal and I would absolutely buy it again. It's super hydrating but lightweight, not greasy, great for sensitive skin, and leaves me with a healthy glow! This moisturizer has helped to smooth my skin especially as I'm dealing with breakouts - gives me better glass skin than some Asian beauty products that claim to do so.

The price is exorbitant and is the only thing keeping me from making it my usual night cream (i work in retail so it takea half a shift to pay for it). I'll jusy have to watch for sales! * I bought the collagen cream to replace collagen masks. I am very pleased with the results after just a few days. After cleansing and toning, I massage a small amount into my skin. I allow it to dry completly and then use Philosohy Miracle Worker face cream over top of it. This gives me smooth, glass skin all day. My skin texture has markedly improved since adding the collagen cream. It is key to properly massage the collagen cream in and letting it dry before adding the second cream. I do not wear makeup, so I cannot speak to how it would layer. * I was really excited to try this and after a few weeks notice no results. * Leaves my skin soft. Will repurchase * I blend this with the  prayer Thomas water drench sheet tint moisturizer. Blends great! Firms my skin and doesn't feel greasy or heavy.  I use this as a foundation.  Quite  expensive for the combo… but it works great with make up or just as a tinted moisturizer with mascara. * This is a great product and feels good on my skin, but I can't use it like other moisture products before applying my foundation because of pilling.. I now use only at night so I'm not putting anything over it. * I like it. I also drink collagen supplements so i think it works pretty well on top if it. Im only 23 so i dont have wrinkles to begin with but i will say that its pretty sticky going on and if you touch your face while its trying to dry than you will get the 'beads' like everyone else is saying but if you dont touch your face until its fully dry it will look normal"

First I want to point out the sales associates at Ulta are super sexist to men and I got passed multiple times every time I asked for help literally ignored me. But back to this product, it's very similar to sun screen I prefer a thicker face lotion like the 2-1 face & beard but that got discontinued. * After years of using Vasaline Intensive Care lotion on his face, I convinced him to try the Clinique For Men Broad Spectrum SPF21 Moisturizer.  He loved it!  For a lotion with sun scree, it's not greasy and  it absorbs into the skin nicely leaving no residue. * If you've ever had a reaction to a sunscreen this one probably contains your culprit. Wore once and broke out in a rash/hives where it was applied. I will now be avoiding oxybenzone. * Applied it at the store to test it out and also bought some, a few hours later had a giant bump on my chin. Going to rerun it tomorrow. * This is the only product my husband doesn't seem to have a skin reaction to.

Now, instead of having several problem areas after a full day of wearing a full face of  makeup and sweating, I maybe have just small baby blemish that resolves itself overnight. It also does not dry out my skin more than it already is, if anything my skin has been feeling softer and more hydrated. I use La Roche Posay double repair moisturizer and it works well alongside it.

Its lightweight but can feel greasy if you put too much so start with a little and add nore to your face if needed. I couldnt tell if this product helped the redness much but it did feel very calming and hydrating on my skin. Not sure if its quite worth the price to me since my redness didnt really improve but I enjoyed my first purchase and am thinking about buying again. * It's moisturizing, calming, and feels nice, but unfortunately this product just doesn't help out with redness. Disappointed. * My skin felt angrier after applying. Tried a few times. Returning. * My skin is very sensitive- i have mild rosacea and can be prone to breakouts. This didnt make my skin burn or break me out, but it didnt improve my redness at all. It's a nice basic moisturizer and i appreciate that its not heavy, but it doesn't actually reduce redness. It can be hard finding things that dont actively irritate my skin though, so if you need a good basic moisturizer for sensitive skin this is a good choice just don't expect to drastically reduce redness. * I use the Peach & Lily Matcha Moisturizer for redness but it's expensive so I thought I'd try this one. It is very heavy on my skin and made me feel greasy. I didn't notice an immediate change like I did with Peach & Lily's. I might just suck it up and pay extra. * Looked this product up online during a rosacea outbreak. I've never had such quick relief from a product. Not only is my redness gone within 24 to 48 hours and a major difference, but also the dryness and scaliness has gone down tremendously.  As someone who has suffered from 18 years old with this issue and now almost 30, it is one of the best products I have EVER used. A little goes a long way and I definitely recommend this to anyone with redness or rosacea. * I really lovr peach sliced snd wantedcto love this because my face gets red in certain areas. I just couldn't find one thing i liked. The product was really liquidy which was okay but it left a weird residue on my face afterward. I dont have very oily skin but it made me feel very oily and greasy. The smell was pretty bad too, i found myself having to put better smelling products over it to cancel out the smell. And i dont mean i want a fragranced product, because i used unscented products to cover up how weird it smelled. It also didnt do much for redness. It crusted over along the rim of the packaging and got really gross. I wanted to like this but i really didnt. :("

I know it's a mineral sunscreen but it leaves such a noticeable white cast. Don't even think about putting other products under because every single one I've tried has pilled off when I go to rub it in * I have very sensitive skin, vanicream is the only brand I have found that doesn't cause a breakout or dry out my  very dry skin. the only con I have for this SPF is it is really oily the first 30ish minutes after applying, even on my very dry skin. I would purchase again though due to being the only product that hasn't caused a breakout or dried out my skin. I love that it is 100% mineral sunscreen as I am allergic to chemical ones. * it was very oily on my skin, left a white cast, and when i put makeup on top of it it made it very patchy * I wanted to love for the spf + moisturizer but it left my skin feeling sticky. I have dry skin. It felt like my skin wasn't absorbing it. It felt like no mather how mucb you rub it in it wont absorb. It also has a white cast, I usually never minded it but with this one I did. * My dermatologist gave me a sample of this and I fell in love with it. It makes my skin so soft. I was excited when I found that Ulta carries it! * It can be a better product. Brand claims to be for sensitive skin but this product needs a new formula. Eyelids need sunscreen too so I put on a small amount (smaller than a dime) and after about 10 mins my eyes get watery. White cast for me is manageable but for how this brand perceives to be great but not really * I bought this product because the regular version of Vanicream was out of stock.  One week later I'm itchy and my skin is peeling like a lizard.  DO NOT purchase this if you actually have sensitive skin."

I have very dry and mature skin and generally need a very thick moisturizer so, thus one surprised me!  It's super light, absorbs very quickly and keeps my skin moisturized all night. * One of the best moisturizers ive used and ive used quite a few. I honestly it better then even the more expensive, better reviewed competitors (like Tatcha or Glow Recipe). The smell is strong but it works really well and makes my skin glow and feel good. * lightweight, not too glowy , easy to layer with sunscreens * I was advised to try this instead of more makeup to cover red areas on my skin. It worked immediately and just zapped my dry skin issues. My friend, who has suffered from Excema for years saw her redness and itchy skin gone within days. * Came back to do a review update because I'm on bottle 3 of this gem right now and I figured most reviews are done after a couple uses or a week of use. I like to read reviews after extensive use of a product. Okay so after bottle #2 I decided to branch out and try something new (I know we all do it!) so after almost 3 mths of using something else my face lacked it's glow and some of my hyperpigmentation returned around my cheeks and upper lip. I had managed to clear almost all of it up while using this! Stupidly I fell for a video of a different product and switched to it. I just went out and bought this again and already my face feels softer again and I know my hyperpigmentation will decrease again! I won't make that mistake again! This formula does not contain dimethicone which is important to me, I don't want a fake softness to my skin, I want a nourished softness. This is light and silky going on and even with dehydrated, dry skin I can skip a top moisturizer most days. The light smell goes away within seconds and does not bother me at all - strong botanical smells cause a migraine- lucky me! This is not a gel it is more like a serum texture or a light lotion texture, it sinks in pretty quickly. The bottle is glass and beautiful on my countertop, plus pump bottles are way more sanitary than droppers or jars. I appreciate a good pump bottle because I know when something comes with a spatula I'm using my fingers after about a week and a dropper always ends up touching my face or not sucking up enough product so I get mad at it! Come on beauty industry there is nothing wrong with a pump dispenser! Take note!!! I highly recommend this product and pray Lancome doesn't ever discontinue it! 
So if you have uneven tone, hyperpigmentation, dry and or dehydrated skin, aging skin, and dislike dimethicone you may love this formula!"

If you have really sensitive skin this might be it.. but Before they changed the packaging i swear the product was better, it made my skin looker younger, hydrated, and would clear my skin. * I moved here from Texas and this moisturizer is the only cream I use in this cold weather. * This is a great moisturizer but unfortunately there's no change in wrinkles * I used to love Clinique and this moisturizer was great, but they changed something and it now gives me acne. * I've been using this for the past few months and my skin has never been better-  Great cream that  moisturizes without being greasy, absorbs fully into skin .  i have very dry skin and it works wonders ! * I love this moisturizer for aging skin. It  makes skin brighter, soft, and silky. My fine lines at my mouth already look better. I had been using a retinoid based cream but it was burning my skin, not this stuff though. It's a bit pricey but I highly recommend it! * I've used Clinique all my life, at 76 I never thought it would reck my skin like it did! Red patches all over my face!"

It matched my skin tone. I just can't get past the fact it made my face extremely oily!!! I will not repurchase! Off to find yet another redness relief product. Sigh. * I personally love this.  I can see why a lot of people would not though.  You have to shake it well because yes it separates, but totally fixable.  It starts off green then turns a light shade once you apply it.  I love the tone, and wear it as my foundation and it gives me a light dewy coverage.  It is thicker, but it works for me.  I wouldnt reccomend for fair or deep skin tones.  Light-medium would work best. * I was hoping this would help even out my rosacea a little bit. Unfortunately the tint is darker than my very fair skin and it also made my skin look grey. * Liquid came pouring out the bottle when I opened it. Tried shaking it and waiting, but the product was completely separated. Looked and smelt expired or something. It didn't blend at all. Also super orange. * This product does what it claims to do. It provides color correction for my rosacea-prone skin without causing dryness like most color correctors do. This product wears well alone or under makeup. I will forever repurchase this product. * I love this stuff. Feels a bit like a bb cream. Very moisturizing. Doesnt pill, but will separate a bit after about 8-10 hours. I apply with a blending brush and I started using tower28 pressed powder on t zone and it helps so much. Feels light on my skin. will continue to repurchase. Great for everyday look * Too sticky and even smallest amount  shows in pores and creases."

Item was returned * This product (I didn't use anything else in my skincare routine) made my skin super irritated, inflamed, red, sensitive, covered in bumps, and itchy, like I've never seen before. My eyelids are also very swollen & it's hard to see. It's been a few days and my face still looks scary and burns every time I wash it and try to put any fragrance free lotion on. Not sure what ingredient in this product I am allergic to. I have used many (stronger) vitamin C products over the years and had never had any issues. I do enjoy other products from this brand though. * I would give this zero stars if i could. It burned my skin so badly I immediately had to wash it off. * i wanted to love this product, i love the FAB cleaners but this moisturizer burns my face. it may be a little bit too strong for my face, even though it says for sensitive skin. * I bought this after using the SUNDAYRILEY vitamin C moisturizer because it's a little cheaper for the same amount of product.  It's very glowy but the product feels greasy and it pills so badly under my sunscreen.  I don't see myself repurchasing after it's gone."

I use Olay sensitive during the winter months and usually add Neutrogena SPF, but I found this product this spring and decided to try it. I absolutely love. I use serum first and then this. I absorbs nicely and doesn't leave my skin sticky. I use under my eyes and my eye lids and I do not experience any burning. I occasionally use powder foundation and it holds all day. the scent is nice and not over powering like other products. * Wanted to love this product however it burns my eyes!! * Great product. * I can only put this on about half of my face because of how incredibly badly it makes my eyes sting. Even if I take care to avoid the eye area, it creeps in them somehow. Feels nice as a moisturizer but it makes me look more sweaty/oil slick than glowy. Have to completely cover my face with setting powder for my skin to not look wet. * this product provided a good moisturizer for my skin but it left my skin oily. I used it with a hydrating serum after but I also used the moisturizer by itself and it still made my skin oily.

This is just my opinion for myself. Hopefully someone else will have better results. * Goes on smooth and keeps skin plump and moisturized. * The charlotte's magic cream is amazing product.  Your face will look and feel younger smoother and with less wrinkle's. Also, using this product your foundation will go on so much smoother looking. I would highly recommend using and you will love it. * It makes my skin look and feel silky smooth. * I had seen someone use this cream on a make up tutorial to help with creasing with make up. I bought the sample size and have been using it every day for a month now and I had to buy a second one because it worked so well for moisturizing my skin for context I am in my late 30s and I have combinational skin, I do not get any breakouts from using this and it really offers a great boost and moisture. I would highly recommend it. * Purchased this product on a whim because it was near the checkout counter. I am so glad that I did. I absolutely love this moisturizer.

Highly recommend. * I have been a Pacifica user for YEARS. I trusted them as an early brand for clean beauty, when that category was much (much) smaller. While this product smelled amazing, and soaked in great...I started breaking out. I couldn't figure it out for a week!

Not only are octyl salicylate and octocrylene not reef safe, but they also break me out terribly with what feels more like a burn. Stay away, if not for yourself - for the environment. * I was very excited to find a daily moisturizer with the bonus of having sun protection. However, I don't want to smell like I'm going to the beach at work (or anywhere else for that matter). It's kinda heavy and makes your eyes water from burning. * I absolutely love this moisturizer!! It is a bit greasy but if u have dry skin this is my go to. I love the subtle smell too! I would recommend this. Just don't get it near your eyes if possible. It will burn ur eyes * it's a bit greasy even after soaking into my normal skin, and has been causing me to break out. It smells amazing and feels nice, but I really miss the Sea &C magnifying primer that was discontinued. The finish was better and didn't make me break out at all. * I don't know why I thought that maybe this time regular American chemical sunscreen actives wouldn't burn the crap out of my face. This product irritated my skin really bad. I bought the whole line and had such bad breakouts and dry skin that it took at least two months to regain even a semblance of normal skin and I only used the line for at best two weeks (but the sunscreen was only once on the face). I was using this on my chest as sunscreen until I started breaking out there too. I have had a bad reaction to nearly all of Pacifica's products and I think I'm done even trying. * The moisturizer works great and smells amazing. However, it's not the best for oily skin. I have combination oil skin and my skin gets very, very oily with this after a few hours. I gave it 4 stars just for that reason. If you have normal or dry skin, I think this would work better."

There are so many other creams you can get for a cheaper price that are just as moisturzing or more. Id give this a 3.8 * I'm so happy that this product was included in the 21 days of beauty.

But, this lotion is sensitive enough not to irritate my skin furthermore and durable enough to lock in moisture to eliminate dryness without clogging up my pores. Happy i came across this brand because I have wasted a lot of money before finding this product. * Please never remove this. It's the only moisturizer I've ever been able to use without triggering my acne!! I never have any product related breakouts anymore!! Finding a good moisturizer that worked for my skin was soo hard. This is so perfect and I've been using it for probably a year now. * I use retinol and aha products regularly so every now and then my skin peels and gets red and sensitive. I have tried a lot of soothing and calming products on the market to fix my occasionally irritated skin but so far this one is the only one that doesn't hurt when applied and that actually calms my skin down. I have used both its cream and balm version. They are both great but I like the balm one a little better. * Glides onto the skin nicely and leaves a nice hydrated finish to the skin. Very soothing for dryness without clogging pores * In recent years i've developed excema on my eyelids, chin & ear lobes. I've tried so many moisturizers that claim to help reduce redness and lock in moisture, but it wasn't until I found this product that my skin changed for the better. I bought the 3 pack sample with the facewash and thermal water and fell in love with all. 

First purchased back in September 2022 & still using the same 3 products today. I even tried to change back to some old products that used to work for me and my skin returned to the brittle and scaly old self that used to be. I remain consistent with this brand, and they have shown me love back, my skin soaks this stuff in and doesnt break me out whatsoever. 

Super gentle and refreshing. One of my favorite pros is that it leaves my irritated and stinging skin, smooth and calm. if you have irritated skin that stings, even when you put your moisturizer on it, this product is definitely for you and will help with that sensation. * This is my favorite Avene product! So much that I finished my first tube and bought two more! It has been very helpful for my dry face this winter and I love using it at night over my serums. * Helped razor burn and is super gentle"

No burn just smooth texture all day. I love this because most give me hwasaches the second i out them on becausebof fragrance but this smells sooo good without any pain to my eyes or head! I can't recommend enough, will be repurchasing! I bought when it was on thanksgiving sale! * PUR's Get A Lift moisturizer has become a staple in my beauty routine! I've been using it for a year and have purchased it three times now. I've only ever bought it when it's on sale, but I honestly think even at full price it would be worth it! I'm 34 with combo skin, leaning more towards oily. My skin is also flaking and peeling right now due to my prescription skincare treatment and the cold weather. This moisturizer does an excellent job keeping my skin hydrated without pilling or weighing it down, and it keeps the peeling down to a minimum, if any! Once it's absorbed, my skin looks nice and dewy instead of greasy, and I've seen improvement in both softness and texture of my skin. It does burn occasionally if I have patches that are particularly red/irritated, but the burning stops quickly and there's no irritation afterwards. The scent is light, sort of citrusy, and it doesn't linger. I use it every evening and one jar lasts me about 4-5 months. Overall I highly recommend this moisturizer! * This facial cream feels great on my skin. I use it daily to help with loss of elasticity and firmness, especially around the jawline. I really do think it's helped my 60+  yr. old skin. * This moisturizer feels amazing on my skin and so luxurious. I would buy again! * I bought this during black Friday sales and biggest regret was not buying more while on discount.

The formula feels amazing in my skin, it literally feels so luxe. And there is noticeable difference to my skin. I'm actually obsessed! * I have sensitive skin and unfortunately lots of water retention in my face due TO PCOS (moon face) I've really started to notice a difference with this product. Especially on a good night's sleep. But I love applying it before makeup. It makes my makeup so smooth looking and skin stays so soft. * Not sure why its so difficult to find this product being a travel RN, but when I can find it in store I go for it!!  My skin is so sensitive and acne prone at 32 y.o and this is the best lotion I have ever had!"

The primer itself feels nice ans hydating but would not recommend putting makeup on top. * I use this product every day with or without makeup, it feels so nice on my skin and keeps it hydrated and gives it a nice glow. * Had such high hopes due to multiple influencers recommending this product. Didn't notice much difference in the appearance of my combo, dehydrated skin. Worst of all id the fact that this product PILLS and doesn't play nice with much of any other skincare products nor makeup. Really wanted this to work! * I used this religiously from the ages of 15-17 and it was my favorite makeup product. I reordered it on sale last week at the age of 25 and it is still so amazing, but not hydrating enough for me anymore. I love the smell, its super light but lingers in the best way. I will still use it and probably reorder but will be prepping with a heavier moisturizer before applying this under makeup. I also really love it for a no makeup makeup day because it just seems to make my skin even and glowy. * I just turned 44 and am feeling it. I purchased a bag of new products including this moisturizer on the recommendation of 2 employees. I wore it for the first time on Thursday with mascara and eyeshadow. A female coworker told me, ""I hope that this doesn't get me into trouble, but your face looks so good. You have the natural glow of someone that just had a good time."" So needless to say I will wear this every day for the rest of my life. * My skin isn't the most sensitive, but it does have random triggers that cause redness and irritation. My face broke out in red irritated blotches, especially near my eyebrows. Love FAB, but this one ain't for me :( * I got this in a Boxycharm and I was SOOO excited as I LOVE things coconut-y! I tried it multiple times, with my favorite products and new products I never tried, and my skin looked oily and the makeup never seemed to sit nicely on top. It also seemed to make my pores look worse"

I prefer a slightly richer formula to nourish my skin. * I am in my late 20's and I notice my forehead was starting to have deep wrinkles and my neck was starting to form unappealing wrinkles.

I am appalled at how little product is in this HUGE jar. The exorbitant cost does not equate to how little product you actually receive. Save the planet, reduce plastic.

I will not be purchasing again. * Shocked as to how little of product waa in that jar! Tula do better! That jar wasnt even half full. So disappointing. * vitamin C is light sensitive, so the top being clear makes the product get stuck in the end of the pump and turn brown when exposed to sunlight. if it was in a totally light sensitive package it would be fine. also, the outer blue plastic ring on the top of my jar broke off, exposing more product to light. the product is fine and brightens the skin well, but i usually have to put a heavier moisturizer on top. id recommend pairing with sunscreen too. i like the shiseido one because its more oily and moisturizing on top of this. * I got this for free during a promo. I feel like it didnt moisturize well. My skin still felt dry (and my skin tends to be on the oily side) and even seemed flaky sometimes. Im glad i got it got free because it is pretty expensive. I wouldve expected it to be higher quality for the price. Also, if you put any toners or serums on before it doesnt mix well or really absord into your skin.  It turns white and takes a while to fully rub in. * I like this brand because it has good ingredients but this cream has a strange smell to it.  I want to say like a burning smell.  I prob will not purchase again. The price point is a bit high * I tried this mousturizer as a day cream and bought the white 24/7 mousturizer as a night cream. My face was covered in tiny bumps (fungal acne? Dermatitis?). Absolutelt do not recommend, it didnt even leave me moisturized. I cut out this moisturizer and the night cream separately to see which was causing problems and they both did. I stopped using the products and the bumps went away."

I wanted to use something a bit more natural. This helps with itching, redness and bumps. It's moisturzing as well. I really love using this lotion and I wish I had found this sooner. * I have very severe eczema and I have tried everything for my face rash. This cleared up the redness in 1-2 days and it also is helping clear up the flakiness on my face. I use it on my body too and it helps and feels very nourishing. * I have psoriasis and eczema and I have tried all kinda lotions. None of them seemed to have helped but I came across this and gave it a try. 

My skin was instantly moisturized and it dulled the redness even the reduced flakiness by alot. I'm impressed and am so excited that I've finally found something that actually works. * My daughters ezcema started getting bad again and we tried this for the first time and it worked !! The itch went away the first day and the rash started getting bettwr the second day ! * I have mild eczema on my fingers along with having sensitive skin on my face, so I thought this would be a nice moisturizer to help with both problems. I've tried La Roche Posay products before, so I was under the assumption this would be another worthwhile purchase. I bought this product two days ago and both times I've used it (immediately after washing my face), it's made my skin itchy, inflamed, and red. This evening, after applying it, my skin got so itchy and red I thought I was having an allergic reaction to my sheets or to one of my makeup brushes/products, but as soon as I washed my face again, the itchiness went away. I only thought to wash my face after reading a review of someone who experienced something similar to what I did. I was even about to take allergy medicine and apply cortisone to perhaps help with the itchiness and discomfort. I would NOT recommend this product whatsoever. * I have psoriasis and eczema. Ive been flaring recently due to the extreme weather. My face has a terrible rash that hasn't subsided. My left arm was so red, dry and itchy, no oils could heal it! 

Within an hour of applying I could see and feel a difference. My face started healing and skin stopped flaking. Break outs were becoming more controlled (clogging caused by psoriasis's 10x skin growth rate). Arm stopped itching and was no longer red! 

Normally I would never use a thick cream like this for my face! It had no burning and helped soothe my skin immediately. 

Very happy with this product! Helps a lot with soothing my autoimmune disease when everything else tends to flare it (yes even from the derm at months of use of products). * Made eczema worse on my face and boyfriend's hands"

I use it everyday AM and PM, and it leaves my face feeling so smooth and clean without the feeling of a heavy moisturizer. I would compare this to the belif aqua bomb, just even more lightweight. * I have sensitive skin so I was scared to try a new moisturizer. I did break out a little bit the first week (around the chin area) but after using for 2 weeks, my skin is in love !!! Super moisturizing and my skin feels great * I have very oily acne prone skin and it works very well. Not greasy at all, althpugh it is a gel. It goes on smooth and i love it. It does not have SPF so i do use an SPF after i use this. * This product absorbs quickly, but unfortunately, it caused a burning sensation on my skin upon application. It left dark spots on my skin due to burning. I couldn't put anything on for almost a week because it burned so badly. Definitely will not repurchase. I do love other products from Kiehls but this one isn't for me. * I may simply be allergic to an ingredient in this moisturizer as it has many positive reviews, but it burns every time I apply.

The fact it contains the stable form of Vitamin C that most dermatologists prefer to recommend is of course THE reason to use it. I also LOVE that they didn't add fragrance to mask the  normal smell of the vitamin C ingredient. Yes, that odd ""hot dog?"" scent is just what the vitamin C smells like, and it dissipates in less than a minute. * Bought this product about a month ago, I was worried at first about spending so much money, but it was time to drop the dime. I'll be turning 35 soon and my skin was dull, dry and sometimes had red patches that would burn when using other creams, correctors and moisturizers. 
Since using this product my skin looks just as young and fresh as it did in my 20's!

I have been using oil moisturizers as I thought they were lighter and absorbed quickly. But this cream is super light and absorbs quickly. it doesn't feel greasy and lasts all day. Now I can really feel the difference when I don't use it. If you are hesitant between this product and the triple repair one for extra dry skin I'd go with this one first. The other is a lot heavier and doesn't absorb as well * Again the best body lotion ever! But what to do when the pump won't get to the remaining 4 ounces of lotion. I have a solution! I cut the the top off with a knife, the take a spatula or kitchen knife and scrape it out and into a 4 ounce bell canning jar. Perfect size & then nothing is wasted."

It didnt absorb and made my skin look so dry…. It also peeled off. It hust stayed on top of my skin and peeled off once dry. Bad bad bad * I think this product has been causing my skin to break out more than usual and leaving small red spots. I think maybe its just a little too greasy and oily. It does hydrate, but not quite in the right way. If youre in a jam and this is all you have around, its better than no moisturizer, but I wouldnt buy again. The smell is nice, if you like citrus, and it does have a refreshing feeling. Maybe if you dont drink any water and your skin is actually in need of oil and lots of hydration this might be a good product for you. * I have been using Orgins Hydrading Cream to mouisturize for over 2 years and I will NEVER use anything else! * its part of my daily routine after every shower and before i start my day every morning"

I always wear makeup under foundation/concealer and i usually keep my base routine super simple (e.g. water-based serum plus sunscreen). I applied this sunscreen under my makeup twice already and both times my foundation pilled and separated. I applied the foundation using a puff sponge. Now, I will only apply this sunscreen on no makeup days and will use as a hand sunscreen as well. * I love it * Introducing Mela B3 UV Daily Sunscreen featuring Melasyl, the multi-patented La Roche-Posay ingredient that was 18 years in the making.

It does not leave skin oily. Takes care of dry flaky skin on contact. Highly recommend. * This stuff is super moisturizing! If you've used the original Water Drench, it's like that but even more creamy.

It's great when you need an extra boost of moisture in dry climates, wintertime, after facial/microneedling, and if you have dry skin! 

I usually use serum before I put this on so I get some active ingredients on my skin and this feels like it seals in the serum nicely. 

I'm in my third jar! One word of caution: this might not be the best option for oily skin or in humid places and I usually alternate between this and a less dense cream. * I received a sample of this for my Ulta birthday gift and LOVE it so I bought the full size jar. It is truly the best and nicest feeling of the Hyaluronic moisturizers. Skin feels amazing!! * the texture is unique in that it feels like a hybrid of a cream and a gel, deff haven't tried a moisturizer like this before! it made my face have a silky feel, almost like there was a protective film. I know not everyone loves this feeling but I don't mind it — looking forward to using it more in the winter! Gifted by peterthomasroth * I received the water drench hyaluronic cloud rich moisturizer gifted by Peter Thomas roth in exchange for my honest opinion. I love the way this moisturizer sits so lightly on my skin. It's hydrating without being greasy * I enjoyed this moisturizer personally. Not super thick , but also not thin. I enjoy using most on damp skin before bed almost as a sleep mask to wake up with soft & plump skin. I can see this being a little suffocating if you have oily or acne prone skin, but for its purpose to help your barrier for us in the dry skin club, I def think it serves it purpose. The texture is nice & soft, applies well & does pill. I'm honestly a fan! (gifted by Peter Thomas Roth in exchange for honest review)"

Lotion with spf that does not have a white cast on the skin. I love it and gives a great glow to the face * I received this sunscreen after attending their promotional walk for the launch of the product. I noticed the very next day I started getting micro bumps that resembled milia or granulomatous. I stopped wearing make up and switched to a gentle cleanser to see if those were the reasons however I remained applying the sunscreen to obviously help protect my face. To my surprise, my skin was only getting worse. It was starting to burn and itch. I've been allergy tested, and I don't have any. The day I didn't use the sunscreen, my skin condition immediately disappeared, so I went to look at the ingredients list. I don't know if Origins is using the oils from grapefruit, lemon and orange for fragrance purposes, but it does not list anywhere that they have extracted the furanocoumarins. After meeting with my dermatologist, I was advised that the citrus oils used in the sunscreen caused photosensitivity, and burned/ irritated my skin. If you are someone with darker or sensitive skin, I HIGHLY recommend AVOIDING this."

Started using this product again this week remembered why I love this! My face is becoming rehydrated again. The brightness is coming back and my rosacea is subsiding. I do have sensitive skin and this seems to do the trick to balance pH levels. If you have tried other products with no luck, try this product. Not every product fits everyone but this one is definitely worth the try. To me... worth every cent🙏 * 'My daughter is 14 and this product has been great for her acne * I love to try new products so I've experimented with a number of daily moisturizers with SPF like Drunk Elephant and Unseen Sunscreen and always come back to this Murad holy grail. It doesn't leave a white cast, is moisturizing, non-greasy, and doesn't pill under my makeup. I use this daily and a bottle lasts me roughly 4 months. I'm honestly shocked at other reviews saying they broke out as I have acne prone skin and never have but YMMV. * This is a decent sunscreen, rubs in fine and makes my skin soft. However this burns my eyes soooo bad. Obviously I know to not get sunscreen in my eyes, but it doesn't matter how carefully I put it on, my eyes burn. I have very sensitive & dry eyes and it just doesn't work. The Tula one in the yellow bottle, is the one I continue to go back too. * I was very excited to try this but was disappointed to find the results being similar to a drug store brand product not to mention this product caused my skin to break out and become oily. Never had those issues with my skin before starting to use this. Also the product just pours out of the bottle causing you to end up wasting product every time you use it which makes you run out a lot faster than you would expect. * I have heard great things about Murad so I finally decided to treat myself to this moisturizer. I wanted to love it SO bad but my skin has BLOWN UP with acne so bad, it's starting to really get to me. I used to struggle with acne but it had gotten to be almost non-existed until I bought this. At first I thought my pregnancy hormones had caused my flare up, and it could be a contributor, but this is really the only new piece of my skincare regimen and it seems like others have had the same bad experience as me too. Will be throwing it away and buying my old moisturizer. * As always, every experience can be different but I'll tell you mine: I have very sensitive skin , dry to normal, rarely have acne besides the occasional pimple. When I started using this, my face broke out like a crunch bar. TONS of bumps and several pimples. I started a new night cream at the same time so I wasn't sure, but as soon as I stopped using this my face cleared. It was pretty instant, at the end of the day the bumps were the worst and I would wash my face and wake up to no bumps (not what happens with typical acne). If you haven't heard of acne cosmetica, google it that way you can watch out for it with this product or any others. After looking closer I realized THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS SOME COMEDOGENIC INGREDIENTS (i.e. ethylhexyl palmitate)"

Im on day 2 and WOW my skin looks soooooo smooth and clear!! I noticed it got rid of my acne too!! 🥹 Love love it! Worth every peny! I used to buy the sunday riley luna sleeping night oil double the cost of this and have not seen this much improvement in such a short term like this!! * After a few days i noticed a cluster of bumps on my neck and chest area. I figured it was from something else like perfume, but then I noticed smaller bumps on my face. I don't consider my skin sensitive so i am surprised. I wish this worked out. * After having my baby, part of my postpartum recovery included extremely dry skin around my chin and T-zone area. It was SOOOOOO bad. My makeup application was the worst showing patchy skin. I tried so many things to help, including high-end luxurious products, but nothing worked until I tried this for weeks. I saw it changed the texture of my skin that included smoother and moisturized skin. I love it so much, I just bought a second one. The scent is also light. Nothing too crazy. This was good to my sensitive skin. Highly recommend!!!! * This product did make my skin feel feel and look amazing.  However, it also caused acne breakouts that I hadn't experienced in many years.  For that reason, I can't use this product.  I wasn't prone to breakouts so it was a bit surprising. * Smooth and penetrates well. Skin feels soft and smooth * Used 2 full bottles and feel very dry. Not the product for me."

I have normal skin. I have noticed it has helped my skin barrier and absorbs quickly, sits well under makeup, and doesn't pill for me. I do use Cocokind Vitamin C serum before using this to add a little extra moisture. However, my only con is it could be a tad more moisturizing. * I have normal/dry, acne prone, aging skin (I'm 35). I have been using this as a day moisturizer and love it. It doesn't clog my pores or cause breakouts, and it sits well under my SPF and foundation. It's hard for me to find a daytime moisturizer that is moisturizing enough without making my makeup look cakey, but this product is fantastic! It also smells really good which is a bonus. * Love this so much. Bought it on a whim in store because I need to add extra moisturizer to my routine for the upcoming winter and am on a c c u t a n e with horribly dry skin. This works more than I expected! After the first night of using it, i noticed my skin looked so plump and moisturized in the morning. No pilling, really light, soaks into the skin nicely without oily residue, and good to use all over the face/neck. Fragrance isn't anything special, light citrus-ish that goes away quikly. Wish it came in a body lotion too!!! Will buy again. * I have combination skin and i purchasd this thinking it should work well for me, but after applying it made my face and neck feel sticky. And I think the scent is too strong of a fruit loop smell.  It just smells and feels cheap. Will be returning. * the tub is a good size for the price and it feels good when initially applied, but even without using any other products it pills up after drying * comes with A LOT and it feels refreshing but it starts to pill if used with anything else"

Ive tried the normal magic cream and it has vegetable oil, fragrance, just a lot of junk. Especially when my forehead can get closed comedones and breakouts easily. I took a gamble and bought the mini and fell in loveee!!! I am so dry in some areas i often peel, so i was prepared to give this away or return (i cant do gel or gel creams becuase of my dry skin). But i was so shocked at how hydrating this is and it make my skin so shiny and glowy and layers so beautifully under makeup. As a sensitive skin girly too, fragrance free is so important to me as fragrances can be irritating. Also, CT is certified cruelty free by leaping bunny, as a girl who lovess animals and only shops cruelty free, so important! Ive since bought the water cream set with the full size and mini that's on the way and I can't wait! Just try it! * Didn't absorb. Shiny. Expensive. * I use the old version and the new one. Both are amazing! It is expensive but its work it. It leaves my face hydrated and a great dewy look * I received this free from Charlotte Tilbury for my honest review. I have dry, very sensitive skin. When I first put this on my skin was glowing. After a few minutes it started to irritate my skin and I had to wash it off. Sadly this particular product was not for me. * I love all the Charlotte Tilbury products￼. I have the other magic cream and it's amazing. So I was very excited to try this one. I love this magic water cream. It is super soft and doesn't feel sticky."

Also were very sticky long after applying just them and no other products for self testing. * Far from a moisturizer but in fact left my skin super oily. * Hands down the best makeup primer EVER. Its too good. My makeup looks freshly applied all day long. I csnt say enough about it. * I spent alot on this and it did nothing for me. I like how the product is provided. The moisturizer itself caused skin irritation after I used appropriate face cleanser foe skin type. Not for eczema prone or sensitive skin! * The formula is fine—nothing amazing—and there are similar moisturizers at a more affordable pricepoint. I have combo sensitive skin and it didn't irritate my skin. I do really like it when i mix it with my retinol oil at night as it helps dry down the oil faster and keep in the moisture. The packaging is my favorite part with the pump top. When i'm out of this, i'll refill it with my cetaphil night cream. I got it when it was half off but i still think it's too expensive for what it is. * Ive been eyeing this product for a while but was put off by the price.

I think it lives up to it's claim: my face appears to be smoother, feels softer. * Bummer that this is now 5 mL smaller than before but costs exactly the same. * Not great for sensitive skin. I love a milky SPF for layering other products but even with a heavy moisturizer underneath it dried my skin and caused peeling and flaking * I go through sunscreen like its nothing because I tend to burn easily. This one is lightweight and comfortable. I wear it under makeup without any problems like some cause. The only downside is the price for the size youre getting, but otherwise I love this product and will be buying it again. * I love the texture and feel of this sunscreen and it doesn't cause acne for my very sensitive skin. Downside is it goes quickly and the price point is too high. * I have sensitive, dry skin. I'm newer to using sunscreen daily. I researched many brands and this had great reviews, so I bought it hoping for the best. Using it over my serums has helped them work their magic. My dark spots have eased up and my expression lines are less prominent. My skin is more hydrated and plump. I plan to keep using this because ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" and it works perfectly for me! Also, sometimes when I introduce a new product, my skin has a bad reaction (redness, irritation, breakout) and this sunscreen has not caused any negative reactions. * It is not as good as people are saying in the reviews. Yes, it blends out well but it just stays on top of your skin and leaves you with a greasy feeling. Also, for the price… definitely not worth it. I couldnt even finish the whole bottle because it was breaking me out so bad. Some people are saying its good for people with acne prone skin but as someone with acne prone skin, yeah it is not it. I gave it to a relative because i didnt want to be wasteful and even they didnt like it and theyre honestly not that picky with their skincare. Korean sunscreens are the way to go especially if youre acne prone and the prices are a lot more cheaper!"

The second day I felt a little tight itching? By the third day I started seeing peeling around my nose and my face felt itchy and burny. Not an overwhelming itch but enough to recognize I'm having a bad reaction. Peeling, itching and a slight burning sensation. I didn't use makeup the first two days but when I put makeup on the third day, it went on blotchy and I could see the irritation on my cheeks, mostly below my eye area. I'm Pacific Islander, NC30 and in my 40's, sadly this product is not for me. * Product is usually good. But got a bad batch and felt bad so I didn't bring it back.

I live in a high desert climate and have combination skin; this isn't great for all year long but in the winter it's perfect especially after a day outside in harsh conditions. Definitely not lightweight and would be too heavy/ oily for someone with oily skin or in a humid climate but it's great when I need it! As a bonus, I love the packaging.

I just purchased my 4th bottle today. Its thick and will last all night keeping you moisturized. Its light scented as well! The bottle isnt super huge and its a bit pricey but definitely worth it! * This moisturizer is nothing short of amazing! Perfect! I've tried them all. This is rich, thick, and best of all..no scent! This pairs so nicely with the milky toner and my retinol and vitamin C regiment. * This stuff is by far the top budget-friendly cream I have purchased! It rivals the ones that are over $100. * The best cream? Yes. I haven't ever tried this brand until now – and I'm a believer. It's essential for every person who need hydration and loves softer skin! * I thought this meoisturizer was a bit too thick, doesn't seem to absorb very well into skin.

Peter Thomas Roth is the best! * I was skeptical at first, but have noticed less wrinkles under my eyes and my makeup applies smoother * Amazing peptide complex and anti aging results * I splurged on this product as I felt my skin needed just a good moisturizer that locked everything in and protected it. The product is heavier than most but I feel it does a great job of hydrating my skin. The biggest con I have is the blue painted lid on the jar peels and leaves blue fragments of paint in the product, thus it going on my face. My fingertips are physically blue after simply unscrewing the cap. It actually concerns me because you never know what companies are using to manufacture their products. Disappointed with such a high price point. * Ive been using PTR products for 10+ years and my skin shows amazing results from the use of these products over the years.

I use this with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide or salicylic acid and it pairs well with all my serums and sunscreen. This is also great under makeup since it's not oily and helps makeup last longer. I've repurchased this moisturizer at least 4 times and I always have a backup! * I love that this moisturizer is buildable. You xan relaly control how much you need. It feels great on my skin and my skin is noticeably more plump. I love it! * I am acne-prone but need a moisturizer for skin dryness, especially during the winter when the cold wind easily dries out your skin. After using this moisturizer, I have had several instances of bad luck with getting a new pimple the next morning. The texture and application (no burning) of this product are fine. It does its job to moisturize the skin. However, not without suffering more blemishes sadly. I picked this while trying to find noncomedogenic moisturizers with clean ingredients according to Yuka, but my mom helped point out to me later this has vegetable oil in it… Cool! 🙃 * its just perfect and a little goes a long way * I dont really know what people are saying about this product, most people are saying its lightweight and non greasy but it feels so heavy, sticky, and greasy on my face, maybe just not for me but I won't be buying this again * I have sensitive skin and this works well for me. Love that it isnt too heavy on my combo/acne prone skin * I was hoping this product would work well on my acne-prone skin, but it doesn't seem to do much for me. It doesn't absorb very well into the skin so the more you use the more ends up sitting on your face. The claims about this moisturizer being pre-biotic don't seem to mean much. Hero specializes in products for acne and acne-prone skin, so I assumed this moisturizer would work well in my routine and be hydrating but I was disappointed."

Now I'm just praying these new wrinkles fade. * It's just temporary, so keep that in mind. * These are not very strong and theyre small. If you havent tried ""frownies"" i suggest trying those. Theyre cheaper for a larger quantity and better results. * I tried these on a few spots on my face, under eyes, smile lines, and 11 lines on forehead. I honestly wouldnt bother using these under your eyes because the adhesive is so strong it pulls at your skin even with wetting them. They did work well on my smile lines and 11 lines but they just soften the wrinkles, my results only lasted about 1 week. Personally I'd invest in a good quality eye cream over using these patches. * I love this idea and if it worked it would be cool but they don't stay on - followed directions to a ""t"" and still fell off within the hour. Returned them to the store as defective * comes off if I move my face :-( * Terrible"

I like how light it is, the price point, the volume of product, the consistency, & how long the bottle lasts. Its travel - friendly and good for all skin types. * This moisturizer is great for the summer or daytime, but personally its too lightweight for my combo skin. Its more hydrating than moisturizing and has a gel like texture. I gave it to my roommate who has oily skin and she loves it * It has helped me a lot with managing my breakouts along with clarifying toner. They really are a great combo to use. All the ingredients are clean and i havent had any type of allergic reaction. Ive scanned it the bottle for acnegenic and condemenic ingredients and it had none and then i also scanned it for toxins and it had none. Overall i would recommend to anyone unless they're specifically looking for a matteifying moisturizer. This oil free moisturizer gives you a slight sheen and glow. * New favorite! This has been amazing for my combo skin. My skin stays hydrated all day long but doesn't get oily. Great as a base layer under make-up, doesn't pill. * lightweight moisturizer , made skin smooth  , I Don't Think this moisturizer won't break you out !!! * i love this moisturizer, its perfect for layering! especially for skincare routines & when applying spf and makeup * I initally didnt like this mosituriser as the birch smell is a little odd…like a tree.

Unreal/ must try! * I do not want my face smelling like vanilla frosting but it did the whole time I used this. My fault but I'd literally have to hold my breath * Earlier this year my dermatologist informed me I have seborrheic dermatitis. I've been using ketoconazole shampoo which definitely helps but I still found myself needing to use cortisone cream on my face (gross!!). So I was researching moisturizers good for dermatitis and while Supermello isn't specifically marketed for dermatitis (it does list eczema) I thought it sounded like it may help. I am SO GLAD I gave it a chance!!!!! its been about 2 weeks now and my face is looking the best it's looked in several years. Patches that I thought were stubborn acne have been clearing up and are almost totally gone. the hydration level us just right so I feel moisturizes but don't get greasy as the day goes on. It does smell REALLY lovely with the light vanilla/Marshmallow aroma. Definitely worth trying if you have skin conditions that make you red/itchy! * I got this as a sample and wowww the smell is so good! It's very creamy so a little goes along way! Im so happy I got it as a sample because now Im definately buying more. I love this brand and it also makes my skin glowy and so soft. I love how my skin feels I usually use their Vitamin C then put on this cream and it leaves my skin poreless and soft. * My skin burns from water, I swear. I am incredibly sensitive to everything. My skin chaps, get red and raw, itches and burns. I have tried most of the major 'sensitive' skin moisturizers high to low end, and this is the absolute winner. Keeps my skin moisturized and smells great. I have found it does not do well under makeup so I only use at night and for the first time, thats enough moisture for me. * I've been using this moisturizer for a few years now and I LOVE it! This is the only lotion I've found that leaves me with no irritation or redness. Highly recommend! * I've gone through a couple jars of this moisturizer - it's incredibly rare to find one that truly doesn't clog my pores, and despite some highly comedogenic ingredients, this one surprisingly does not break me out at all. Also makes my skin incredibly soft. Unfortunately, however, as I continued to use this, noticed my pores becoming increasingly large and more noticeable, and my skin texture getting worse and worse. Stopped using for a few weeks (keeping everything else in my routine the same) and my  texture is looking quite a bit better. So, no go for me."

I've tried a lot of SPF and finally found one that doesn't leave me ultra shiny and oily.  I really like this product and will keep using it! Only downside is that I think some of the oils in the product settled and the last couple of uses did leave my skin somewhat shiny but other than that, my skin was left soft and even toned! * Contains harmful chemicals that damage our coral reefs. Please make smart consumer choices, this sunscreen is not environmentally safe and my face broke out when using it :( * this sunscreen gave me such a healthy glove, and my skin did not feel oily or greasy at!!!! I used to have the Laroche poosay (I hope i spelled it right) sunscreen, and it would make my skin shiny, but it all oily. I have normal skin and I really love this product. * I'm in my 30's and have always had acne prone, oily skin. A few years ago, I was able to clear up my skin with a strict morning and night routine that includes prescription creams, but every time I would try using SPF, I would immediately break out. I've tried dozens of prestige and drugstore brands! This moisturizer with SPF is the first that hasnt caused a single breakout. I've been using it for over a month now and I will continue to as long as its on shelves. * This product is okay as a moisturizer and sunscreen but leaves you shiny looking. It also does not work well under makeup at all. I learned the hard way after I was almost completely done with my makeup and it began lifting and leaving ugly peeling patches when i used a powder brush. For the price, theres way better sunscreens out there. The murad sunscreen in a blue bottle is about the same size and the same price but works amazing. * I switched to this sunscreen and my pores and oily skin were controlled also my skin felt amazing! I could t rebuy it because I was pregnant but whenever I get my hands on this again I would gladly stick to this only. The only con is the size and price"

I will definitely keep this in my beauty routine * I mean it...when I say I am nearly 30 and struggled with hormonal skin since I was 12..I have spent SO much money on skincare products, it's insane. Recently I bought a $150 moisturizer claiming it was magic, when THIS..PUR Cloud Cream (for a fraction of the price)..was all I've ever wanted and needed. It is the silkiest product and it just melts into the skin like a drink for your pores. I mix it with a dab of Charlotte Tilbury ""beautiful skin"" foundation and I feel like a million bucks. Immediate confidence boost. It's just enough tint to perfect the redness from my acne and scars...and it leaves the most gorgeous finish, like I just got back from the medspa and my skin is plump, hydrated, and GLOWING. I got this as a sample from Ulta and I had to come back here, buy the full size immediately, and leave a review. I knew nothing about it so when I searched it up I was expecting this to be much more expensive. A double win for it's attainable price!! Please never discontinue. * I am allergic to tocopherol acetate, and this is the only moisturizer I can find at Ulta without it. Thank goodness it works well. Feels nice, not greasy. Absorbs quickly, and isnt strong smelling. * This is one of the only things I can use on my face! I dont have to worry about my face sweating when
I wear it. It is lightweight and is scent free! * Okay so. I have extremely finicky, super sensitiveGr, combination skin. Ive tried lots of moisturizer brands such as Clarins, CosRx, Drunk Elephant, and Beauty Counter. As great as they worked, my skin sucked up the creams too fast and didnt last me throughout the whole day. Serums helped, but would cause me to break out in consistent trouble spots. The way it sat on my skin did NOT feel even. Rough versus smooth. And when using foundation, you could see the different textures. 

Since using Pür Cloud Cream, I can honestly say this is one of the most amazing products Ive ever tried?? 
When applying, a little is a lot. It smoothes out so evenly, feels cold and refreshing right off the bat. I let it sit about a minute or two, did a test feel of my skin. Let me tell you, the texture was IMMEDIATELY consistent over my whole face. Trouble areas such as the nose, above my lips, smile lines, and eyebrows were rich and hydrated. Im actually kind of shook how quickly, too.

When using foundation, it gave an airbrushed feel and look. My skin still felt smooth! And was definitely still hydrated. 

So excited for trying this product. Will DEFINITELY buy it again. * Lightweight and goes on smooth"

I am 60 yoa and have struggled with acne and skin problems since I was a teenager.  I believe it's mostly due to bad genes because my sisters and daughter also had acne problems. This moisturizer absorbs well, but because it is oil free, it doesn't leave my skin shiny or greasy looking. It makes my skin feel fresh and smooth. I do not look my age and I believe that using these Baremineral products contribute to my better looking skin. * I use this daily after cleansing. It is light-weight but easily covers my face & neck. It isn't oily at all. I have used other products in the past. They cause breakouts and leave my face feeling greasy all day or soak in immediately & don't create a good foundation. * Best moisture I have ever used. A little goes a long ways.

Using the whole set it's very expensive but if you are careful and use them as indicated they last.  I bought mine on October 2022 and run out of them in February 2023 bravo!!!  And that was because I had to travel to different countries so I ended taking small amounts in my containers when I when to Europe. Then on my way back I travel to Mexico so I took all the bottles because I was going to stay there 3 months. Then my set got finished there   I checked in the fine stores in Mexico but there were no Refills so I had to I'm wait till I return to USA to buy them. I'm strongly recommending the Lancôme Absolute products they all wonderful! Use them carefully and daily! * I love this product, and I've tried quite a few high end moisturizers. I'm 52 a post menopausal. I only gave it 4* because of the price, and the fragrance.  Most over the age of 50 will likely remember a bottle of White Shoulders sitting on their grandmother or mother's vanity, and that's what the smell of this cream reminds me of. Very floral and not just roses. I can live with the price, but I would definitely give it 5* if Lancôme would make a fragrance free version. The fragrance doesn't linger, but the smell reminds me of what old women smelled like when I was a child."

My skin has significantly changed and not for the better. I tried so many new products and nothing compared. I came back to Estee Lauder and decided to try this Nutritious line, and I absolutely love it!!! This one does not make me oily or shiny and I love the way my Estee Lauder foundation sits on my skin. I will say I bought a whole regime and I'm using the Nutritious essence and moisturizer, and the Perfectionist serum and SPF. I got them on sale during Black Friday sales recently and I couldn't be happier. I can say this moisturizer is making all the difference for me. * Not for me feels to heavy * I have quite dry skin and this product just doesnt work with my skin type. Makes my face look and feel dehydrated. I can maybe understand why this would work for oily folks but not enough for dry skin. * I got this creme in the Glow kit. When I cleanse my face, I apply it as a standalone and immediately see my face turn red. I have sensitive skin, plus large pores. :( * I don't see the hype. Texture of cream felt like light face lotion and went on just the same. I've used it twice as an over night mask and I woke up with dry skin. My Elemis night cream is 5x more nourishing than this ""face mask"" cream. * I live in the Arctic and the cold sucks any moisture out of my skin. I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts from moisturizers and new products. Basically if you touch it, it's going to have issues. I received a sample of this with my last makeup order and this stuff is amazing! I have been using it as my daily moisturizer and my skin is soft, hydrated, and most of all clear!

It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy! * I can't believe it took me so long to find this amazing product. I will have it a part of my skin routine forever now! Such a great lotion for my whole body. Highly recommend purchasing if you have dry and sensitive skin. Game changing product so excited I found it! * As someone with dry and flaky skin, I've tried countless lotions over the years, but none have worked as effectively as this one.

The lotion has a rich, creamy texture that absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. My skin feels immediately hydrated and smooth after applying it."

I am super sensitive and just about everything breaks me out. It is kinda crazy because I've been using Bare Minerals makeup for 25+ years and never considered the skin care products. On impulse, I picked this up and I'm really glad I did. My skin is really happy. In two weeks it has reduced redness, dryness, and you can't see the lines on my forehead anymore. So if you want results without all the harsh chemicals this is the cream for you. * Been using this for a couple of years. This product usually lasts me 5 months. Am glad for that! * I love how it feels as I am applying it. It feels wonderfully soft and smooth. Will be purchaching more! Love It! * My skin was looking dull and dreary. I love bare minerals powder foundation, so thought I'd try their skin care. The ageless line is lovely, leave my skin clear, bright and smooth. My friends commented after only a week about how great my skin looked! * I love the night cream. It is easy to use and I can feel the cream working at night. It is light and clean feeling. I will be using it all the time. * I bought this face cream in a small travel size to see if I liked it. It's great! Keeps my skin hydrated and soft. * I use this product at night when I'm settling down and wait for my skin to absorb. I can tell a big difference and I love it."

I use this moisturizer in my night routine because of how moisturizing it is. 
Yes, it does pill if it is not the last step in your routine. It is my 2nd to last step, and depending on how long I wait to apply the oil afterwards, affects how intensely the moisturizer pills. The moisture and effectiveness is worth it though. If I can't give a good 10 minutes before applying oil, then I will just skip the oil that night. * Biggest disappointment from Ulta so far… not moisturizing… for some reason it dehydrates my skin… dont waste your $$$ * This works great! A little goes a very long way. It's very moisturizer yet not oily. I love this night cream. * Doesn't absorb into the skin as quickly as I would like, but once it is, my face and neck are so bright and refreshed. * Keep The Phenoxyethanol out of products please! 
If Europe can ban Endocrine disruptors why cant we. 
This is like the only ""clean brand"" in the states. So dissapponting.. * I have combo acne prone skin for reference. 
This is like a light watery lotion but absorbs like a rich cream. It soaks right in and paces a velvety, supple feeling that I love. Sometimes my skin is drier so I could see me being able to use this during the day also without being too heavy. It does have a scent. It's like candy strawberry and flowers. It's light and goes away very shortly. You only need a little of this because it spreads so well. It can be easy to go overboard. I think this is definitely worth the money given the ingredients, packaging and how long this will last. Especially compared to other creams. I don't breakout but wake up with super soft, nourished skin. * I want to love this product so badly but the fragrance/essential oils in this caused my eczema to flare up. I'm so sad but I know it's on me for buying something with fragrance, natural or not. Otherwise I think it's a nice product it wasn't drying or anything and the texture is really nice just wish they had a fragrance free version. I will stick with the vegan ceremide cream"

Even the one my dermatologist prescribed! I went out on a limb to try this 2 in 1 sunscreen and it did not disappoint. Great mattifying and no white cast (I'm a brown skin gal) yet moisturizing. I took this on vacation and it withstood the very hot heat and sun. Two thumbs up for me. * My previous tube was great. Mattified the skin. Absorbed quickly. It did not make my skin oily. This newest tube is not good. While it still absorbs quickly it does not mattify my skin. I am very oily in a couple of hours if not before. I must note that i do shake the tube before use so i dont think im missing anything. * I used this as a cheaper alternative toy usual SPF  but it was greasy and broke me out. If i dont shake it i can see the oil. * I bought this sunscreen on accident because I thought it was a free gift and didn't check until I picked it up in store. However, I decided to use it because I needed a new sunscreen and surprisingly, this worked very well for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it sits on top of my other skin care products very well. This is also the first sunscreen that hasn't irritated my skin or burned my eyes which I truly appreciate because every sunscreen I've worn in the past had an extremely painful reaction on my eyes. I plan on repurchasing. * I use this product for daily use. It is lightweight and keeps your face clear and oil free. * i'm so glad i found this sunscreen! beginning with the biggest pros for me- i've seen no new breakouts, doesn't pill, and feels like nothing on my skin. i really hate when i can feel an spf on my face but with this product my skin feels light and clean. pilling and clinging to dry patches is very annoying and i've noticed ZERO pilling/exaggerating of dry patches. 

the few cons i have are very nitpicky- fairly strong smell and isn't mattifying. the smell is almost floral but mostly is just a normal sunscreen smell, which isnt a huge deal to me but might be too much for those sensitive to fragrance. i also wouldn't consider this a mattifying products which i actually prefer. theres little to no added shine but again, not very mattifying.

overall i'm so glad i finally found an spf that works on my skin! * Considering I have very oily skin, this didnt moisturize my skin at all. I had to use it as a straight up sunscreen over my regular moisturizer which defeated the purpose for me. It was defined mattifying to the point of drying."

Cleanser feels clean w/o stripping. The extolment stings and works! The moisturizer also stings a bit but feels great on! Sensitive skin beware. * This is a great deal! Yes, the one product is smaller than they said in the details, but all of these still last a long time. The face wash has a really nice light citrus smell. I havent used the moisturizer yet because I couldnt read what it was exactly or when to use it (before looking it up) because the white writing on the transparent container was impossible to read on top of being partially rubbed off.

It has helped so much with my skin, it does not iritate it at all (i have sensitive acne prone skin with rosacea) and leaves it feeling so smooth! I have not been breaking out as much since using this, in fact this product helps to keep my skin at bay when it comes to breakouts and random pimples. Cannot recommend it enough! * Very light toner, makes my skin look and feel amazing, I definitely notice that my skin looks rougher when I run out and don't have a back up bottle. * This is the best toner you could buy. Love that they use clean ingredients. Its very gentle if u have sensitive skin but still removes dirt, excess oils, etc. its a must buy, along with the other skin care products they have < 3 * This product has immensely improved my skin clarity (tone, brightness, fading pigmentation) along with leaving the skin feeling extremely hydrated and smooth. * I've purchased this toner twice now and I absolutely love it. It's the only toner I use in the morning and it's perfect for makeup prep! Don't let the size fool you- my first bottle lasted me about 5 months!

It goes on smooth and isn't greasy. My skin feels hydrated, and I have a dark spot that has gotten significantly lighter. I highly recommend this lotion! 

Aveeno, please don't change this formula ever!! * I am happy this product does not dry out my skin, but I don't feel it will protect my face from sunburn.  That being said, my face was peeling because of the high strength of my lotion. At least it is now not peeling. * The moisturizer did help with my overall skin/was a decent moisturizer, but the pilling is/was so bad, almost constant, even hours after application. It also doesn't sit well under any make-up, even a just light skin tint. The smell is strong, but it honestly just smells like soap so that wasn't an issue for me and I kind of liked it. * This product is light and smells good.  I love that it has SPF. * I've used it for over 10 years. There's been changes with it over the years, but my skin soaks it up like a sponge and leaves me glowing. * Broke me out in hives! I have sensitive skin and for 3 days my skin was a flame. It finally erupted into hives on the 3rd day. Everything irritated my skin after using this. Do not try this product if you have sensitive skin. Opt for Dermalogica. * New formulation is terrible. 
I've been using this moisturizer for years! I always get compliments on my skin, it's been my go to forever. I even mix a little of it into my foundation the past few years when i want a more sheer coverage. 

They changed the formula and this one is not a winner. It instantly pills. Doesn't absorb. Right after putting it on, my face feels dry. I am so so disappointed and on the hunt for a new moisturizer."

I am almost 45 but I don't look it. * My beauty consultant, Beautifull (yes! that is her name) is the best in the business! I had so many questions when I was looking for a skin routine. I must say my skin is WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. She is located in North Texas! * I stopped buying moisture surge (and clinique in general) earlier this year, and searched for a comparable moisturizer all of 2024. Out of the 15 products I tried this year, this has been the best option by far. I honestly think this gel moisturizer is even better than Clinique's because it's fragrance free and 100% cruelty free. So many moisturizers are also too heavy for my sensitive and acne prone skin, but this is so lightweight and absorbs quickly. It's definitely worth the price, and a little goes a long way. * This is so light and so hydrating, it does not leave any sticky residue on the skin and no harsh smell. It cools the face and gives it a nice glow * I'm in my mid 40s, with sensitive combination skin, and this gel cream has been absolutely fantastic!  My previous moisturizer was a bit too heavy, and this one is just right for day and night use!!! * This product is going back! It was recommended to me because they were out of stock of my go-to product (a different brand). Upon applying a thin layer of Tula 24-7 Weightless Moisture Day & Night Gel Cream to my face and neck, something instantly felt off. The texture was fine so I couldn't place what it was. A minute or so later it started - the slight face burning. Minutes passed and it got to the point I couldn't ignore it and had to wash my face yet again just to get it off! * I received this as a free sample and now I'm hooked. It works so great for my skin. It leaves it refreshed without being heavy. Other moisturizers can be too thick but this is thin and blends perfectly. Worth the purchase!"

I really liked it.  Easy to use, it didn't leave a white cast, I like everything about it.  I have to buy my own now.  My sister won't let me have hers! * I have been on the hunt for months for a moisturizer with SPF that isnt overly dewy in order to skip a step in my routine and thought this might be the answer based on the reviews I read. This might work great if you wear foundation daily or are under 30 with no texture, and yes this doesnt feel greasy or oily BUT it makes me look greasy and oily. I only spot conceal on most days and when I use this I have to put powder on my face because it makes me look so shiny, and the powder doesnt really stick in areas i dont have makeup on. For the price I really dont think i will keep it. * The cap bottom is concave so it doesn't want to sit upright on a flat surface in my bathroom. 
Please leave well enough alone.

My usual store didn't have Andalou SPF face lotion anymore, which I've used religiously and happily for many years, and this was the closest alternative. I have never had a bad reaction to any lotion but this one irritates my eyes horribly, to the point of not being able to drive safely and having to wash my face and flush my eyes. Do not recommend! * I love this brand and I was excited to find a daily moisturizer from them with spf and even went through several bottles but I had to stop using it because it caused my eyes to burn and water profusely. I would also add that it has a very oily finish, so if you have oily or combo skin, this likely isn't for you. * I've used this through a couple of bottles. My skin takes time to adjust to products (hence why the couple of bottles). 

I love that it is cruelty free and has vegan collagen. I love that it has SPF 30, a must for me, BUT it smells like sunscreen. It is definitely moisturizing, I don't have an issue with dry skin, BUT it's rather greasy. My daughter has even commented that my face is really greasy when I wear it (not really the vibe I'm going for). The chemicals burn my eyes as the day goes on. If I even wipe my eyes, it takes me minutes to wipe away whatever traces of this moisturizer is around my eyes. If I regularly wore makeup, this would be extra problematic. If you wear contacts, I do not recommend this. Imagine that burning getting caught up under your contacts.

I really, really wanted to love this because I didn't want to go through having my skin adjust to a new product, but I can't justify it based on it being a habit. * As mentioned by others, this would be more accurately described as ""SPF 30 sunscreen with collagen."" Smells exactly like a normal drugstore sunscreen. It's light and doesn't feel too greasy (but there is still a bit of that feeling). Overall it's ok * Just finished my bottle and ordered another one.  I have sensitive, adult cystic acne, 44 yr old skin that is in the normal to dry stage. This product:
1) has a sunscreen like feel to it when you first apply it, then it fades away
2) has a great glass bottle that you can get ALL of the product out of!
3) Spreads well- at little goes a long way- to much will make it sticky and it won't dry down fast
4) plays well with Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid serum and PUR love your selfie foundation. * I'm getting older, and my skin is changing, and I hate it. My old favorite daily moisturizer/SPF by No. 7 started making me breakout after years of no problems, so I had to search for something new. All the others I tried that claimed to not clog pores also happened to be too drying for my slightly oily but aging but still acne prone and also kinda dehydrated skin (ugh). But the moisture level of this Goldilocks cream is just right. If you have dry or slightly dry skin you will probably like it, if you are 40+ you will probably like it, if you're young and have oily skin you might NOT like it because it is not a light liquid, it's definitely a thick-ish cream. I can tell the fragrance they were trying for was *floral* but it leans more chemical, although it disappears in a minute or two. After application the skin feels moist, but not greasy. Makeup applies perfectly over it with no pilling at all. I somehow manage to not look shiny over the course of the day, which is practically miraculous. It doesn't seem to make me break out, as I've been using it for several weeks with no notable flares. I am relieved to have found my new favorite! * i like how this spf does not leave a white cast like other spfs. Plumped my skin right up and gave it a nice silky glow."

I have never used clarins before so I took a leap of faith. Big mistake. 

It does nothing for my skin… super greasy, no firming, and makes my skin look worse. For the price I expected at least a decent product. In my opinion there are SO many great moisturizers out there that out perform this and are cheaper. * Bought this because I like the day cream version a lot.  This however was just not a great formulation for me.  It simply NEVER absorbs into my skin and then it just rubs off on my pillow case or hands eventually.   And I don't use an excessive amount because of the price tag.  I'm a big fan of using the minimal amount required.  It's too late to return it, so it's just going to move into my graveyard of products that I can't bare to throw away because, $$$, but just don't work on my skin.  Le sigh.  But, I still love the extra firming day cream and all my other Clarins products.  I would recommend trying a sample of this before buying if possible so you know if it's a good consistency for your skin. * Excellent result 👍 * Light weight, non greasy.  Plant enriched.  Vegan.  Long lasting.  Eco friendly packaging. * Really recommend this line for girls after 50. I feel my face firming after second week and continue improving. * This product is amazing!"

This did not irritate my skin, and honestly it has improved my acne. My skin has never looked better with Cosrx and i've been struggling with my skin since middle school. I am now 26. * This stuff is GOLD. I had never used retinol and read that a small percentage is the best way to start and wow.

But the product is hydrating but does not reduce redness as much as i hoped it would. * Helps SO much with redness from sun damage! * I Have Used This Toner For Over 5 Years & I Have Loved It. Its The Only Toner I Go Back To Because In Its First Use You Can See The Dirt That Is Removed From Your Face & In Every Use. You Can Visually & Physically Feel/Tell The Difference When Using This Product. I Like To Add Some Into A Spray Bottle & Then Remove Excess With A Cotton Pad. This Also Helped Me Years Back When I Was Having A Long Going Acne Breakout. I Have Not Had Any Problems With This Product & Will Continue Using. * I did not find this product to be soothing. Instead of reducing redness it seemed to make my skin more red. It left my skin feeling sticky instead of moisturized. My skin is a little sensitive, but i dont usually have to stop using products without finishing them. * I have mild rosacea. I am not consistent in my skincare routine, I will get some surface acne.   I implemented it into my current routine and used it consistently for 3 months. After about 6 weeks, I tried some variations to ensure that there wasn't interaction with what I was using. It did not exacerbate redness or irritate; however it also, did nothing else. The earthy smell dissipates as it dries. Nothing changed  I would not waste my money in the future on this particular product. * I have rosacea and this product helps to soothe redness and prevent further reactivity. It feels good on the skin and smells great. * Its so expensive, i wish it wasnt worth it. But it is! This makes my dry, sensitive skin so smooth and hydrated. 10/10."

Wearing the mask during Covid killed my skin barrier and I have not been able to revive it. Every product I have tryed has given me cystic acne or i have had a horrible reaction to it. And just when I thought all hope was lost this 💎 was recommended to me. I was a little weary as its a cream and feels like a balm. I am oily to combo and anything thick just make we more oily. This absorbs great as long as you dont over use it so find your sweet spot. Start out with a little cuz it goes a long way. This helps Hydrate my skin while I useing active to clear it up my breakouts. * While it does feel nice initially when you put it on that fades quickly and just makes my face feel tight. Absolutely not worth the price point. There are more hydrating options out there. * I have dry, sensitive skin & this cream has been a game changer for my skin. I love that this balm doesn't have shea butter like most balms because i suffer from acne & cannot use that ingredient on skin. This cream has cleared my acne (i assume because it has salicylic acid) & my skin just looks & feels so much healthier. I love it so much, but like someone else said in the comments…I wish they made a bigger size because i go through this stuff so quick since i use it day & night. * I have extremely dry skin. It's very sensitve and reactive due to an autoimmune disease. I can use hardly anything on my face. I use and like the Kiehl's cica but thought this would be better with the colder temps now. It's not. Skin is dryer and I can tell my skin barrier is unhappy now. It reminds me of using body lotion on your face (which I've tried a few times) it leaves a chalky matte finish too. Not good for my middle aged skin. 
Their Cica cream is far superior and so is anything by Ursa Major for all you out there with unhappy dry skin. This doesnt cut it as a facial lotion. * This is vry healing on my dry skin. It gave me a couple of whiteheads on my face, but I noticed that it really calmed the redness. It's a trade-off. I would rather cover a pimple with a little makeup rather than cover up the redness all over my face. * It's fine. It didnt do much for my chronically dry skin. My face actually looked a little worse the next day. However, my neck and upper chest were improved after one use. It's now my neck/chest cream and i'll stick to an oil on my face."

I've not only purchased the entire live for myself but family members and it's worth every penny. A LITTLE goes a long way! * The best face cream I have ever used. * This face cream was so expensive and I felt it didn't work for me. It made my face very sensitive and my foundation didn't stay well on top it. I was disappointed but will try something new. * I am loving the results of these products. * I've tried MANY MANY moisturizers. this one is THE BEST hands down! Use it day 1 and your face feels like a babys butt the very next day. That's how fast and amazing this stuff works. Nothing will make your skins feel this soft and supple. And no breakouts! (a few moisturizers make me break out for some reason but not this) The only downside is the price; it's horrendously expensive so I hafta wait until my bday & xmas gift cards and rewards points to buy it so I only buy it about once a year. A little goes along way so I can make it last a few months. I'm 56 with normal to dry skin. * I have used it for a week now. Like the way my skin feels I use it at night. Packaging is a little over the top. Contents is a lot smaller than it appears from the outside.

It does fell kind of like the elf tone adjusting primer just not as greasy. My foudnation glided on real easily. I do think my skin does look good so far :) Very mich recommened for those with dry skin * Was just in Ulta looking around and saw this new item from NYX. Decided to try it and I am so happy I did.

I really wanted to love this product but after a couple of times of using this it made me breakout bad . My skin is usually clear but it broke me out on the spots I applied. If you apply to much it can also cause flaking and ruin your makeup . * Sorry but 5 STARS is not enough, I am giving 5 MILLION STARS for my rating on this.

But, i havent noticed any difference. I have noticed at the very top where my hair line is, it gets super dry. I am not sure if it is the moisturizer or what but i have tried several different shampoos and conditioners and still have the problem. But i havent tried a different moisturizer yet. The smell does not bother me, it does smell good. I do feel like it isn't as moisturizing as it should be though… I really wish I could find the old Chanel Hydra Micro Creme! 

Honestly, I believe this moisturizer just depends on your skin type. I use it with my Chanel foundation.. I am still iffy about it because I feel like it also shows my ""fine lines"" more but I am not very good with all of this anyway. Lol * I unfortunately have sensitive skin, I find the fragrance to be irritating on me. Plus I have a bit of a break out coming in from hormones. I've been trying it for a while, I really wanted to love it. * Best product ever. * The No 1 Chanel line is phenomenal. I have 3 products now and will continue to add more. This is just what my ""mature"" skin needed. 
Thank you Katarina…Chanel and Ulta are lucky to have such a professional, knowledgeable and kind associate! * I got this as a sample and I immediately bought it once it ran out. I live in the desert so my skin gets really dry with the weather here, this moisturizer has been the only thing that's been able to hydrate my skin without leaving it greasy and my pores look like they're getting smaller. I'm pretty selective when it comes to spending money but this was well worth it. * I tried this in the store on the back of my hand and could instantly visibly see a difference in my skin texture.

So, I did some research and started to use ELEMIS. I guess it's ok except for the bottle it comes in, terrible. Very hard to come out, I ended up cutting it open and put the contents in a jar. Advice, change the container * I got a sample from ipsy— ordinarily I would not go for shimmery products but this gives such a healthy, natural glow on mornings that i dont have time to slap on layers of serum. It rules! * This product gives your skin a natural looking glow without looking fake. * i personally don't use it as a standalone moisturizer. i mix half with my lotion and it still provides a good glow that is almost overwhelming,but not. i love it and will always keep 
it on the counter * I had received a sample of this. It sat with my other samples for awhile, and one day I tried it. From that day on I was hooked! Put on after cleansing, serum, moisturizing, and spf. It makes a great primer before makeup, or you can use it for no makeup days as a beautiful finish that leaves bare skin glowing.

I gave it a few tries I thought my skin was drying out because of the cooler weather but nope, this was the culprit! I cannot even fathom paying full price for this product. * I dont like the scent. It smells good when you're putting it on, but then it makes your pillow smell like wet dog. This dried out my face horribly and created big dry patches under my eyes and above my eyelids. I have to return it. * My skin is extremely sensitive to new products, especially retinols. This took a few weeks to get used to, but I'm now using it almost every night. My skin has SO much more life to it! * I recently switched my skincare line from Lancôme to Kate Somerville and let me just say that my face hasn't looked or felt this good in years. I have seen more results in only a few short weeks than I ever did with Lancôme. AND this line is less expensive. It's a win win! * For the first two weeks, everything was fine. Last night, I put it on and it literally burnt the skin off around my eyes. I love the smell and feel of it, but I please be careful if you aren't used to using retinol. Avoid adding near your eyes or mouth * Texture-creamy yet light weight

It's super lightweight, so it doesn't feel greasy or heavy, and it does a great job at smoothing out my skin. I know it's a bit pricier than some other options, but it's totally worth it. Basically, if you're looking for a good moisturizer that'll keep your skin happy and healthy, this is it. * I love my travel sized moisturizer because I've been noticing some slight changes to the complexion of my skin. I have been targeting some fine lines I've been getting around my mouth area and neck because I'm a year away from 30. I wish the SPF was a tad lower but I like that there's SPF in it. It's a good product to have and I'm glad I was gifted by dermalogica. * Gifted by Estée Lauder , Loved the product, it was lightweight and perfect for my night time routine. It worked perfect on my sensitive skin, I will continue to incorporate it into my everyday routine. It was not overly fragranced and blended nicely. * I try to find products that already have SPF included so having this available in travel size is not just convenient, but also a great product. It's moisturizing without being heavy so it's great for daytime wear. Its great as a base before applying foundation.  Gifted by dermoligica. * Dermalogica's Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF 50 has become my go-to daily moisturizer. From the first application, I loved how it felt on my skin—lightweight yet deeply hydrating. It blends seamlessly and leaves my skin feeling firm and smooth, making it a perfect base for makeup. I've also noticed a brighter complexion and improved elasticity over time. Plus, the broad-spectrum SPF 50 gives me peace of mind knowing my skin is well-protected. * This moisturizer is very hydrating and perfect for someone like me who often forgets to apply sunscreen 
before leaving home. Its milky, lightweight texture absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't leave any white cast. It's perfect for layering under makeup without feeling greasy or heavy. The dual-action formula hydrates the skin while providing sun protection from uv rays. Gifted by Dermalogica! * Very hydrating with not a strong scent. The travel size is perfect for tossing in a daily bag, and reapplying when the spf has worn off or washed off. My skin didn't get burned in the sun, so the spf50 seems to work well! Something I will definitely repurchase. Gifted by detmalogica"

I'm a skincare junkie and I try new moisturizers all the time, but I always come back to this. The texture is PERFECT. It's a lightweight gel-cream but still as deeply moisturizing as a rich cream. A lot of gel creams dry down to nothing after an hour or two but this stays a lonnnng time. I literally use it like a nighttime rich cream, that's how nourishing it is. I tried the new vitamin c cream from Olehenriksen but its not as good as this OG one. May they never ever discontinue or reformulate! * My skin never looked better since using this entire line * you have no idea how many moisturizers I tried in my life and this became in my top 3. omg the glow I get with this is unreal. i get so many compliments from people about my skin when I use it. it doesn't break me out, it actually helped me clear my skin ! i will buy this again and again and I hope they will not change the formula! * I went on a trip and only brought this moisturizer for face and body. I got a little sunburn and used this and the burn went away over night with no peeling. I will forever use this as my after sun lotion. Highly recommend. * After using this product once I woke up the next morning with severe redness and achne-like bumps over my entire face!! I wanted to itch my face off it was so bad. Once I removed the product my face started to calm down. My skin is never sensitive like this, but it did NOT like this product what-so-ever!! * I wouldn't say that I am a fan of any skincare product, I hope they just do their job. Nothing has floored me like this skincare line. I bought this moisturizer because I bought the eye cream a couple weeks ago and LOVED IT. I can actually feel these products working on my skin. I've been blessed with normal skin and I can actually feel the benefits of this product. I feel moisturized and my skin feels ""alive"". I would highly recommend. * Big fan of Ole Henriksen products. I've tried them all and while its hard to choose a favorite, this is my go-to. It smells great (like a fresh orange) and feels even better. My skin just looks younger and better."

This lotion promises a lot—gentle exfoliation, brightening effects, and hydration—all while being safe for sensitive and acne-prone skin. 

By the end of the week, my skin looked more even-toned, and some of my dark spots had started to fade. The gentle exfoliation from the lactic acid helped in renewing my skin without causing any irritation or redness—a common issue I face with more aggressive exfoliants. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid exceeded my expectations! This dynamic blend of lactic acid and vitamin C not only brightens my complexion but also gently exfoliates. My skin feels smoother and looks more radiant. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula makes it ideal for use under makeup. This lotion has swiftly become one of my top choices for achieving a glowing, healthy appearance. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C is perfect for my normal to dry skin. It also brightens and evens out my skin. I love to apply it when my legs are out for a natural glow! * Looking for bright and radiant skin? Look no further! The lightweight moisturizing lotion contains 7% lactic acid for gentle exfoliation and Vitamin C for skin that will look glowy and fresh! My skin looks smoother and softer after just a few days! * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid is a staple especially for the Summer. I'm always on the hunt for some sort of vitamin c lotion. Since we have hard water that can be so tedious. Not only does it help repair my skin but I also get to brighten my skin at the same time. * I'm a big fan of the AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid AHA! This product truly brings out the radiance in my skin with its brightening formula that gives me a nice glow. I already own a few AmLactin products, but this one stands out to me because of its amazing scent – a lovely hint of cocoa that I adore. I believe this ingredient plays a part in maintaining the health and glow of my skin. I've noticed that the Vitamin C in this lotion is really working on evening out my skin tone and keeping it super smooth! * This product has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine, especially because my skin needs extra moisture when I'm constantly in the sun in the summer. I love that this product absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue! Highly recommend"

I had to wash it off. Returned it to the store. This one is not for me but Olay doesn't make it easy to know which one of their products to use. * I purchased this moisturizer from Ulta and it arrived within a few days. I use the product both morning and evening even if I am supposed to only use it once a day. My skin appears brighter and it is definitely smoother. I even use it on my neck but so far I haven't noticed a difference there. * This smooths my face and doesn't cause breakouts which so many moisturizers do. I haven't found a moisturizer yet that doesn't break me out. It lasts all day and works well underneath your makeup or by itself. I definitely plan on continuing to use this. * A couple months back I went on vacation to the Bahamas where my skin ended up breaking out very badly.  I brought this moisturizer with. It felt like my face was burning off and every time I took a shower more skin peeled off my face. It was the most miserable time ever. I assumed it had something to do with the trip. A couple days ago I tried this product again, the next morning the same thing happened, immediately this time. My face is burning, feels hot to the touch, bright red and is breaking out with little bumps all over and starting to do that gross oozy thing again. Now I realize it's this moisturizer. It might be awesome on some, just not me. I really wanted to like this product but I wouldn't wish this horrible reaction on anybody. So I guess just be cautious and if you notice something doesn't feel right, stop using it immediately. * This stuff isnt just great for your face, but can work on other sensitive areas too. I had dark marks/hyperpigmentation left behind from a medical adhesive left on my thigh too long, and this genuinely helped to fade those lines to a point where they are less noticeable * I love the way this smells. I use it in the mornings, a little hint of citrus smell is nice to give you a little wake up. Goes on a little sticky, but drys smooth and soft. Definitely recommend. * I've been a licensed esthetician for over 5 years and also an Ulta employee. I got this as a gift for the holidays and had no interest in trying it. I'm such a skincare snob. Well, I tried it. I absolutely love this moisturizer. I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear it because I'm glowing."

Light scent. Does not irritate my sensitive skin. Calming. Definitely a favorite face cream. * I bought this and absolutely love it!! I will definitely buy it again!! * I have acne rosacea along with endometriosis, so my skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and breakouts so easily. I have tried every moisturizer from the drugstore to my dermatologist prescriptions, and nothing, I mean nothing has compared to this. this has not made my face itch, burn, or breakout. it actually took away about 90% of my redness in the first 24 hours i used it. i never thought Chanel would be my life line, but its now my holy grail. if you are truly sensitive, and not just ""sensitive"" like the majority of women say and they use like Cerave on their skin, but seriously have sensitive skin, try this out. you wont be disappointed. id rather pay more for quality ingredients than anything from a drugstore. * I have been a hardcore Charlotte Tillbury Magic Cream fan. I started using tretonin so it was suggested I use this moisturizer before and after applying the tretonin. I absolutely love it. It's extremely moisturizing and smells amazing. My face is very dry but after using this it feel so soft and smooth. It's kind of small for the price but I love it so much I will suck it up. * I wanted to love this item but I used it once and the second day, the pump stopped working.   I tried to pump many times but no product was coming out.   It was definitely a splurge but for the price it's not worth it.   Maybe change the packaging??? * I love the results of this product but I'm allergic to the fragrance. I was sneezing, runny nose, etc. Why does everyone who make such lovely lotions have to ruin it with fragrances? * My skin looks so healthy radiant and feels soft to the touch!"

And no, this product probably isn't trending on Tiktok at the moment. However, this is one of the absolute best and most luxurious face creams I've ever used, and at a desirable price point. It leaves my cracked, painful and psoriasis-prone face plump, dewy, glowy and hydrated for the entire day or night. It performs better than the majority of my high end brand creams do and is extremely gentle. Highly recommend trying. * It moisturizes my skin too much! It looks great under makeup, you wake up as if you had just washed your face, I love it! Super moisturizing. * I am of the darker persuasion in her late 30s and it is hard to find a moisturizer that does not over power you with the smell. But this, this one is lovely. It goes on like butter ladies. Trust me it blends well with other products too. * This cream smells like the airplane cabin bathroom pink hand soap, which is slightly offputting. It also feels thick and heavy without seeming to sufficiently moisturize my face, so I think this formula just isn't for me."

It leaves a beautiful glow and deeply hydrates but again, not for oily skin or if you leave in hot weather.Too heavy for a day cream * I got this product with high hopes. It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy. I don't like the packaging, but i've noticed a lot of brands going this route so its whatever. I would recommend it though."

I have oily acne prone skin and I've experienced no breakouts or excess oil during the day. * I got this whole line on a whim and i can definitely say its healed my skin barrier and got rid of my acne. This stuff goes on smooth and feels so good on my face, i wake up very refreshed, the spf in the morning version is a plus. Thank you ROC🧡😁 * I've been struggling with adult acne for about 2 years now. One of the things I've learned is if your skin barrier is shot - you're not going to heal your acne. This product has significantly improved my skin for the better. It truly does what it says: improves skin barrier. It also will help heal a breakout literally overnight which is amazing! * Been using it at night after my HA application and waking up with silky soft skin with faded blemish appearance. Will buy again. * Because of my new facial eczema, my skin barrier was in need of help. I tried multiple products that left my skin feel and greasy and heavy, But this product was a lifesaver.  It's lightweight but very hydrating.  I can't wait to try the daytime, cream and face wash * I've used this product for 2 months now and haven't noticed ant differences in my skin. I was looking forward to the green tea and ceramides ingredients in it. The texture of the moisturizer is fine. Not super thick and not too thin. I have oily skin and it doesn't make me breakout or anything. Just not seeing the results I anticipated. I'd rather use the Olay's regenerist lines or Peach & Lily's matcha pudding over this where I can really see a daily difference * Usually healing my skin barrier means putting up with a week+ of slathering my face with a thick moisturizer or balm. As someone with sensory processing issues, I hateee feeling residue from those products on my skin, especially when going to sleep (iykyk)

But OMG this product is a PERFECT balance of hydrating and lightweight. It feels like my skin drinks it in and by the time I'm ready for bed there is hardly any residue! At first I worried maybe this meant it was too lightweight to a truly heal my barrier, but after a few weeks I can attest that it really does work.
The only downside is the packaging (they don't stand up) but tbh the formulation is so good, i'm still giving 5 stars. I also recommend the AM moisturizer, but idk how effective it is as SPF. Def get the night time though!"

It also has a nice smell to it. * I have been using this Hydrating cream for over one year now. I like how it works and how it makes my skin feel. * found this product on sale and thought I would give it a try, and so far, I really like it - feels nice and haven't had any bad reactions, nice find * Wow! I was blown away by how effective this max hydration cream by ROC is! When you first apply this you can feel it deeply hydrating your skin. It's fast absorbing and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. After about a week of use i started to notice a slight reduction of my visible fine lines and wrinkles. After about 3 weeks to a month of use I have much firmer skin. This cream is amazing! 
Contains Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol for maximum results. Dermatologist tested. Paraben free. Non comedogenic. Non irritating and fragrance free. 
I received this product free from Roc & PinchMe. * So gar I'm enjoying the  line smoothing max hydration cream. It's a bit thicker than I anticipated but it's creamy enough the it goes on smooth. After just a few days I noticed how hydrated my skin feels. I can't wait to see what the future holds in continuing this product.  Because I sure need it. Retinol these lines honey.. retinol these lines lol. Thanks ulta * ١like the effectiveness, moisturizing, and skin softness of the product. They mention it works well, leaves their faces feeling hydrated, and is the absolute best moisturizer they have ever tried. Some appreciate wrinkle reduction and the skin look. However,I have reported that the product can irritate sensitive skin and burn their eyes. Opinions are mixed on the scent and value for money. * Love the feel of my skin after putting this on.

I would recommend! * I just bought this came home put it on and instantly got a headache from the strong perfume smell. It's like they dumped a whole bottle of floral old lady perfume in this moisturizer. I looked at the ingredients and it actually says perfume and that shouldn't be in a face moisturizer.

Now that I've used it I will definitely repurchase in the future, even at the regular cost because I think it is worth it. I have oily skin and most moisturizers leave my skin oily because they are just too thick and creamy.

Do not use for outdoor activities. It will burn your eyes SO badly. I don't have sensitive eyes or skin but I was practically blind on a summer hike. Horrible! I expect more from a brand like this. * I do have to say I only just tried this product so I'm unsure if it will break me out in the future. However it feels lovely on my skin. Before I applied this product I had some slight dry patches on my skin and it noticeably reduced the dryness. It didn't leave any white cast on my skin (I do have very fair skin though) and it made my skin looks very dewy and glowing! I would definitely recommend this product :) * I really do not understand the bad reviews. This is a great moisturizer with SPF in it. I personally like an all in one product and with 4.2 ounces you get a good value for your money. Not only does this have great ingredients, it is hydrating, sinks into your skin very easily, doesn't leave a white cast, and does not make your eyes burn. My skin glows after applying and it also wears SO well under makeup!! I do not find this sunscreen to be greasy at all. It actually makes me less oily throughout the day compared to the other SPF moisturizer I was using previously. I was using the Cerave AM lotion but wasn't in love with it as it took a lot of TLC to blend in and made my makeup pill. I was recommended this product by a friend and I am so glad I bought this. For those concerned about fragrance I notice a very very slight sunscreen smell but it doesn't bother me and I am someone who is sensitive to scents. This is a chemical sunscreen so some people may be sensitive to that. I am someone who isn't. I prefer chemical sunscreens anyway because they usually do not leave a white cast and are more hydrating. Mineral sunscreens are always too drying for my skin and leave too much of a whitecast. * I love this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I just love how it applies and how moisturized my skin feels afterwards. * It's ok. Def more of a sunscreen feel. Doesn't leave a white cast but takes a while to soak in. I have to wait quite awhile before I can begin applying my makeup. Like a lot of Kiehl's products but won't buy this one again. * I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now and I swear by it. I put it on in the morning before applying my makeup and it works perfectly. I've found that some moisturizers make my foundation look kinda wonky, but my makeup goes on top of this one nicely. Also, I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this product. I'm never going back!"

I am 10 years old and I live in Florida so this is a must-have * This product received the National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance, as listed on the NEA website. I passed over this product for years because the package does not include the seal. I was absolutely missing out. This jar cream is the best body moisturizer I have ever used on my eczema, dermatographia, contact dermatitis, and other skin disorders. It has absolutely helped my skin heal from flare ups as well as help prevent new ones. I do not use this on my face so I cannot speak to its effect on acne. It's comforting and relieving to know I have finally found something to mitigate the suffering. No more intense burning pain just from water or scratching until the skin is raw. This is not a beauty product to me, it's a medical necessity helping my quality of life. Be patient and give this a try, your skin will get better. * Im currently using this moisturizer along with a 10% Benzoyl peroxide cleanser and its the best. My skin type is dry but acne prone fyi. This moisturizer can be used for the face and body and my skin does not feel dry or tight, Simply moisturized. * I use to moisturize my face in the morning and night. I definitely recommend! * So im new to skincare. I was having a bad breakout. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin. Ever ""sensitive skin moisturizer"" straight up burns my face. This moisturizer has never hurt my face. I use this as my night time moisturizer. In only a week i have seen great changes to my face. It feels super smooth. And dont quote me on this, but i BELIEVE this product has niacinamide in it. The niacinamide cleared my redness. I highly reccomend if you are stumped on a moisturizer for sensitive skin. * My skin is dry and that makes it quite sensitive. But this lotion and shower gel does not irritate my skin and certainly helps it feel better."

Helped minimize fine lines after minths of use . * Although I enjoy the smell, the bottle is manufactured so terribly that even the lightest pressure expels the cream outside and under the lid. It is already half way gone with only using it a half full of times because the lid does not lock and stay in place! Highly disappointed. * I need C10 now! * Vitamin C does wonders for your skin. I use this for daytime care in conjunction with the Redermic R in the evening. It's a great combo ! * I use Redermic C every morning as my moisturizer.  I put it on, let it stay on a few minutes to absorb, and then apply my foundation and other makeup. * I use for 1 year and my skin now looks better, my Dermatologist recommended it 👌🏼 * I used to use Dr Perricone products which are great but pricey so I read about the LaRoche line and some have gotten rewards from New Beauty Magazine. I gave it a try and I am very happy with the results ! I use Redermic R every other night and the Redermic C everyday in the morning. My skin looks and feels the same as when I used Perricone products. It consistently delivers."

The idea that it helps to brighten the skin without Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) won me over. I find Vitamin C can be too aggressive on my skin. * I love this moisturizer! Its my favorite to use day in and day out. It has an extremely soft, lightweight texture so its great for daily, but also has so many brightening, moisturizing, and mild resurfacing properties, its also great for my evening regimen as well. Ive noticed a lot of my dark spots evening out, and my skins surface looking more ""glass"" like. The Vitamin C & Beautyberry in this work together so well to be brightening & moisturizing. This is definitely one of my HOLY GRAILS!! * I seen a significant difference in my dark spots with this product! * This cream is amazing! It even tone my skin and took care of the dark spots. I've been it regularly, and I love the feeling of smooth and find lines! * Love how my skin looks more even * I do not have sensitive skin and this product made me break out. I'm 56 and never had acne issues. I do not recommend this"

Some people complain about the scent but I really enjoy it. Kind of reminds me of fruity pebbles and makes me smile. A little bit goes a long way and works great for my combination skin. * I think this is best moisturizer I've ever used and can't believe how great it makes my skin feel. I have only used it so far in the dead of winter and it makes me feel completely moisturized, like I just left a facial. I also have rosacea and sensitive skin and this hasn't bothered me at all. The lemon-y smell is so amazing I kind of wish I had a body lotion that smelled like this too! * I'm regular customer. * This cream is awesome. My skin has a beautiful glow now. * ive tried many different moisturizers and i also love the belif ones, but this one is absolutely amazing. my skin has never felt so hydrated and it stays glowy all day long! i definitely notice my skin has been
 brighter since using. the price doesnt matter when its this good of a product . no pilling and doesn't leave me looking greasy either. will repurchase when i run out, but a little goes a long way! * Serum meets lotion in this age-defying product! I had been using VitC serum in the morning and a night-time cream before bed and during the Beauty Steals event, I discovered this! I'm hooked! It's a bit high-priced, but that's the only con. I'll use a coupon and some rewards points and purchase more soon. It's great! It has a lemony scent and goes on very smoothly. A little goes a long way. It absorbs quickly and evens out my complexion. It's not greasy, leaves a nice vibrancy and I'm already seeing a difference after a week! Impressive! * I like this brand and decided to try this one with the sale. it's so light and makes my skin glow. No breakouts or bad reactions. Such a pleasant scent, like a lemony dessert."

It's almost like the product went off or dried in the tube and the dried out parts mixed back in. You can visibly see the particles in there * I have oily skin. I JUST bought this today and it has a thick consistency, and it smells like nothing. Maybe a little tiny bit like chemicals. But it also has a white cast, so if youre a person of color i wouldn't recommend this. * this product sucks. I've tried it a number of times and every time it pills up. it flakes off my face and makes it impossible to do makeup on top because it flakes off so much. do not buy! * Although it does provide oil control and has little to no white cast, it's very thick and isn't ""lightweight "". Very thick and makes it hard to distrubuted across the face without roughly dragging it on your face. * Its not light weight and it feels like a sunscreen and not a moisturizer. Its really heavy and leaves a cast. IMO its not melanin friendly i had to wash it off in order to not walk around looking like a ghost. * Not a ""lightweight daily moisturizer"" at all. More like a thick sunscreen. Didnt have any bad reactions with it but it was difficult to rub in consistently and dried really quick. Does help with oil control though. Probably wont repurchase. * I love it. I use as primer and spf. the less product under my makeup the better. set with powder."
