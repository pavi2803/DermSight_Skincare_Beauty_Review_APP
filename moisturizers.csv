0,clinique,moisture surge 100h auto-replenishing hydrator moisturizer,pimprod2021615,2576544," * Went into store and asked for a day and night moisturizer that did not contain silicone. Young lady said this was the best. Unfortunately it does have silicone in it, returned. * yes I love this product and how much it has help my face skin at the age of 66 * This is my second order of this moisturizer and I love it . I use it in the morning and at night. It makes my face feel smooth and clean. I can see and feel the difference in my skin . * This is the only moisturizer I use and it works for me.   I love it and it helps keep my face fresh and glowing. * I have been buying this product for 2 years. I absolutely love it! I can feel a huge difference in my skin when I forget to use it in the morning. My skin is much softer, not dry, clear, no complaints at all. * On my 5th tub! Have tried many other brands, but nothing compares to this hydrating, light weight formula. * While I tried the other moisture surge without aloe, I didnt have any reaction but a week after using this specific one, I started to have red, raw and itchy, dry flaky and scaly patches on my skin. Now about $200 and a dermatologist later, I found out this product gave me eczema on my eyes, cheek and jawline. I don't have a history of eczema in my family or myself and don't have sensitive skin so this reaction was a tough one. Not saying it won't work for everyone, judging by the reviews many people have success with it because everyones skin is different but just be super aware of your skin as it can take awhile for a rash to show up."
1,bubble,over night hydrating sleep mask,pimprod2035928,2600876," * This is one of the best nighttime moisturizer I ever used! It's even good for younger skin(my little cousin loves it) after a few hours my face feels so soft. And the same when I wake up. Just don't wear in the daytime it could react to uv. ‚ù§Ô∏è this * I got this product because I thought it was good for sensitive skin. I saw a bunch of good reviews saying it was good for sensitive skin. But when I put it on no more than five minutes later, my face got really red and it started to burn really bad. I have super sensitive skin so if you have super sensitive skin, I do not recommend. * I liked this product then it started to burn my skin?? May not be the best for sensitive skin people * This breaks me out so bad i even gave it more than one try (just to make sure it was this that beoke me out) and it was this I like other products like Surf up and morning rays, butthis is just not for me!!!! * i literally use this every night!!

it's sooo hydrating and gentle!! i have sensitive skin and this helps soo much!! literally glowy hydrated skin overnight! i apply over my moisturizer! * Works so well! So hydratingüíúüíú * it took me a while to decide whether or not I wanted to buy this, but once I did, I did not regret it. I highly recommend this for sensitive skin. the results are Wonderfull."

It is gentle on my facial skin. * Despite knowing that nothing out there compares, occasionally I'll stray to another. But like a man who really needs a place to stay, I'll come crawling back apologizing profusely for ever having left. My skin loves you * Very easy to work with. * Really wanted to love this serum because I was told it's scientifically proven to make a difference. Unfortunately it has a fragrance that made my sinuses begin to run. Also, I have sensitive skin and this made my skin burn and itch. * I have used this cleanser for years. It is perfect for removing makeup  and even eye makeup being very gentle.  Non drying no greasy feel. Your skin feels clean. A small amount goes a long way * I have used this amazing cleanser for years. It is truly ""one-step"" as it cleanses my oily skin well, and also takes all my makeup off. I haven't used an eye makeup remover in years. 
I have converted my son to this cleanser for his acne prone skin. * i been using this consistently for about 3 years, best face wash ever. anything else breaks me out, i tried to go for something cheaper wnd instantly regretted it. my skin is the clearest with this"
4,drunk elephant,protini polypeptide firming moisturizer,pimprod2028061,2588434," * Love how hydrating this is!! * I have very oily acne probe skin. I dont use any moisturizers on my face cuz i usually break out. Im 38 about to be 39. I saw the reviews and decided to buy it. It is expensive but i truly have to say its worth the price. I been using it for about 3/4 months now. I was using it consistantly the first month at night but i noticed maybe 1 day out of the week I was waking up with a tiny white head.   I use it a few times a week now. I actually like using it in the morning before i put my makeup on. My daughter whos 13 I caught using it and I laughed but she actually loves it haha .. i did notice the pump after a while wouldn't pump the cream out so i had to keep pumping and it started working fine adtwr that. A little goes a long way. My skin does feel a lil irritated if i clunk it on but if i put just the right anount its fine. Like i said, my skin is very sensitive. Its smooth, smells pleasant , lightweight and very moisturizing. I personally will continue to buy it. The peice is outrageous but you pay for what u get. * I bought this for the first time in 2023 (a smaller size). This moisturizer makes my skin feel hydrated without being greasy. It's very lightweight - this is a great moisturizer for folks with oily, combo, or normal skin. I have continued to repurchase this since and have gone through 4 of the 3.3oz size and 1 of the larger size they sell around the holidays. I have used similar moisturizers / dupes and haven't found anything that compares to it. Love the Protini Polypeptide Moisturizer! I'm not a fan of most other DE products, but this one is A++++. * I got this moisturizer and I heard amazing reviews about it. I got it while being indesicive on its price, but still got it to treat myself on my birthday. After about 1-2 uses I broke out so bad! Weird because I never ever break out. My skin is usually amazing and fine with products. This broke me out so bad to the point I was crying so hard to even move my face! I would never even think about buying again and would NOT recommend getting it. And my skin is a mixture of oily and dry. Although, I have tried other products from Drunk Elephant and they have been fine, so I guess this moisturizer just doesn't work for me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è * I needed an oil-free, cruelty-free moisturizer to replace my discontinued holy grail by another brand.  After trying a couple different brands that did not work out, I took a chance on this one.  I am pleasantly surprised by the results!  It is not greasy, and it verges on a matte finish without hitting that overdry consistency.  It does not cause my skin to go into overproduction of oil like others.  It goes on nice and smooth and absorbs evenly.  Some people may dislike the smell of this lotion--to me, it smells vaguely like wheat, and that is okay with me.  This product is a little on the expensive side, that is its only downfall. * Drunk elephant has to be one of those hype brands because I've spent over $400 on their different products & have never seen positive results. I've bought this face cream a couple times & I get milia on my forehead & temple area everytime I use this. I wouldn't waste the money again after I stopped using it but if it works for you do you * Solid option‚Äîmoisturizes and rich but not heavy. Absorbs easily. Goes well under makeup. Does not irritate my skin‚Äîyay!"
5,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial cream with squalane,pimprod2002804,2540233," * Love the feeling very light * This has become my favorite moisturizer & have been using it for a few years now. I have tried SO many others but always come back to this one. I do have one other favorite but this one is best for me & for my sensitive skin, lightweight & soothing. * My sikn turns read very easily even if a product is for sensitive skin! But this right here did not disappoint!! Little goes a long way!!!! Definitely worth every cent! No irritation or burning AT ALL which is hard to find for my skin! Just made my second purchase. * I ran out a face cream I used to use  and needed a face cream really bad and quick so I stopped at ulta and came across KIEHL'S face cream. I read the reviews on the ulta app and saw that it had many good reviews and its good for sensitive skin, so I bought it. once I applied the face cream to my face, I fell in love with the cream! I have sensitive skin so I always get scared if a face cream will start burning my skin but this was smooth, super hydrating, hydration lasts all day, and no smell at all which is perfect. This is my new face cream and little goes a long way! * this brand is amazing * This is a very reliable moisturizer for me. I already know it works for my sensitive skin and doesnt break me out. I dont consider it the most moisturizing cream that i tried but it gets the job done. Also works great under makeup. * This product wasnt as thick as I would've liked it but it absorbs well and is for dry skin. This is definitely an everyday face moisturizer."

7,tula,24-7 weightless moisture day & night gel cream,pimprod2045112,2624255," * Loved this! I will definitely be repurchasing myself. After just going through winter my skin was so dry, this helped a bunch! It didn't irritate my skin and left it feeling moisturized. * I am a skincare junkie, and well, this one just worked well for my dry, mature, 50-year-old skin. I feel as we age, our skin changes anyway, but I never thought a gel would be better for my dry skin. This one is truly like water for my face. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The texture is very smooth and it's very cooling. I like that the moisturizer is very gentle. I really love tula packaging. I think it's so cute and there's not really a scent to it. * I Recieved this product for free for my honest review. This gel cream has a cool feeling when applied to the face.It is really soft.It leaves your face feeling hydrated.It left my face feeling smooth.Your face will feel really moisturized. * The packaging is cute. I wish they wouldn't claim they are ""clean"" because they definitely aren't. They have artificial dyes not to mention other ingredients that aren't great. I feel it would be a good amount for the price if it was made better. Oh well * Very effective, super absorbent and makes my skin feel so hydrated. I honestly love it. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The packaging was simple. I love the scent and ingredients! The scent was very nice and floral. The texture was very smooth and not sticky or greasy."
8,it cosmetics,confidence in a cream anti-aging hydrating moisturizer,pimprod2033684,2598796," * I have been using Confidence in a Cream for many years. I am 77 years old but taken for at least 15 years younger. Not too bad! This cream gives me the kind of moisturizer I need. * I've been using this product for 7+ years and I love it. * After I use up my last jar, I won't buy again.  The formula changed and not for the better.  It doesn't hydrate as much.  When L'oreal purchased the company, they said they wouldn't change the formula.  They lied.  So I went on my mission to find a product that works.  Even the serums are a waste of money.  I'm very dissapointed

. * This product was buy 1 get 1 free * I am 67 years old and my face is starting to feel dry and rough. I asked for a good moisturizer and this product was highly recommended by a sales associate. I felt it was a bit pricey but since it was so highly recommended I thought it was probably worth the cost. Unfortunately, this cream caused my skin to break out, which hasn't happened since I was a teenager. I didn't think my skin was sensitive but I guess its changing as I age. I cannot personally recommend this moisturizer. * I've been using it for 5 years and keep on buying it. * I love this product. I've used it for a couple of years now. It makes my skin look great. The people at your store are wonderful too."

Sits heavy on the skin and it makes my face feel sticky at the end if the day. Like a tacky primer. Just sits there * I wanted a good daily moisturizer that wasn't going to break the bank, and this one does the job!
I really like The Ordinary's products in general. * I have dry skin. My fine lines are more noticeable when my skin does not have enough moisture. I love how my skin looks like glass. * This moisturizer is simple but perfect. I've used it for around 4 years now, EVERY summer over my acne-prone skin. It's perfectly lightweight for warmer nights but hydrates at the same time. I will never use anything else! * A little goes a long way. And it's nongreasy. No scent is perfect. * It gives a glow to the skin,not too greezy..."

I don't mind a soft scent, but this is overpowering. * Im not sure what is i. This that my skin doesn't like but it didn't work for me. * This is the best primer i've ever tried my makeup and base routine has been saved due to this product!!! * I love the way it's both a moisturizer and foundation base.  It goes on smooth never greasy and dries quickly.  It also works well on my sensitive skin. * Great under makeup * This truly is one of the best primers. I have oily and acne prone skin. Most primers do not work well for me or provide the longevity I need for my makeup to last. When I wear this product my skin feels well taken care of and my makeup lasts. It is pricey, but worth buying around the holidays when you can get two for the price of one!! I belivw this would work well for any skin type. Its not flashy, but its the base everyone needs for their makeup to last!"

13,la roche-posay,cicaplast balm b5 soothing therapeutic multi purpose cream,pimprod2018263,2570171," * Product leaves a white cast, so cannot be used on the face, which is what I bought it for. * I asked the sales associate for what they would recommend for an oil free face cream since I have lash extensions and did not want it to affect my lashes. And this is what they suggested, so I bought it. I get home and start using this produce and immediately I see issues with my lash extensions. After doing further research on this product it is not oil free!!! * I think some people are giving reviews off another one of their products. This is the hand balm, for hands. I love it though. I get reallt dry, rough hands. Especially in the winter ita god awful. I end up getting cuts in my fingers and all from washing my hands so much during the day and the cold weather. Its so soothing to use this when tour hands are dry. * i got this for a moisturizer post-microneedling and ended up not needing it. i have been using it as a spot treatment and it significantly decreases my acne after just one use! ive been using it for almost a week now and my acne is down to just 1-2 pimples on my face. this tube will last you so long since you need less than a pea sized amount every use! * I have sensitive combination skin and this works wonders when my face gets irritated. This meant to seal in moisture and is to be used after your normal moisturizer. I spot treat where my red patches are, or on my cheeks when they are very dry. Dont use it everyday because it is very thick. Also very good for eczema, because calms down redness and irritation. If you use it as intended this will last you a long time. * There is an online skin doctor who recommended this product for dry eyelids.  My first clue should have been to ignore advice about the eyes from anyone except an eye doctor.  My bad.  This irritates the eyes so terribly and should not be used anywhere near them.  But there's more.
So that I would not be out the money I shelled out for this, I tried using it on hands.  It only makes dry skin worse.  It doesn't even apply smoothly.  Balm?  There is nothing balmy about this.  In my opinion, this product should be launched into space, or at least into the rubbish bin.  My advice:  Don't listen to the positive recommendations. * I am shocked at how amazing this product is!  I was a longtime lover of The Body Shop's Hemp Hand Protector and I've been cycling through hand creams since TBS shut down.  The search is over!  After one night, the dry patches between my thumb and fingers are gone!!  The skin on my hands looks smoother, better, healthier, and hydrated!  I almost didn't buy this because of how small the bottle is, but the value is spectacular, and you only need a tiny bit.  I LOVE this- my new bedside staple."
14,dermalogica,dynamic skin recovery spf 50 moisturizer,pimprod2029957,2588996," * I tried the sample size and loved it. When I saw the minis were BOGO, I purchased it because I loved having a smaller size to carry with me in my purse and work bag. I'd definitely repurchase this SPF again. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate it or have a weird scent. * This Moisturizer was perfect for me in the weather ( Purchased in March 2025). This summer, every time I used it, within 1-2 hours eyes are burning me ( I work in a room with no sound light). I will be going back to trader joe daily sunscreen. * I used to have patches of dark skin on my forehead and upper lip. I realized after a couple months of using this that my patches were fading. 
I've used this product for several years now and no longer have the dark patches. I will not go without this product. It provides fantastic sun protection as well. I spend a lot if time by the pool and rely on this for my face spf. It has worked wonderfully. * Great product, absorbs quickly, non greasy formula * This cream is not like my favorite‚Äî Lanc√¥me Renergie HPN 300, but ok. I tried it because the Lanc√¥me is getting very pricey. It's a bit thicker and has hardly any scent but doesn't have all the great ingredients like the Lanc√¥me. * I do recommend this product to my friends and families and anyone that I can * I have tried so many products for my dry skin from inexpensive to expensive.  There's something my skin loves about Dermalogica products, this one included!"

I noramlly have combo skin with an oily T zone. Testing it out during the day is too much for the warmer months but just right for colder more dry months. I've had this moisturizer for 2 years and I love it best at nighttime especially over my lips as its not irritating and makes them feel nice and hydrated. I also focus on applying the product over the areas that will get fine lines overtime (not really the T zone since I get oily.) Absolutely will purchase time and time again! * Bought a whole routine from them to be disappointed in the results * I wanted to love the glass skin collection.

My skin was completely clear until I used this. Now I have acne all over the side of my face. * Received this as a sample. I used it for about a week and starting breaking out. I love the way it made my skin feel but I dont recommend this product if you are prone to breaking out easy. * Not for oily skin! It was a gift and I broke out, and unfortunately I break out in huge acne. I had 5 big pimples right away. I gave it to my mother in law. I'm still waiting for my pimples to clear up. It's been over a week or two. Unfortunately I cannot exchange the gift. * I am going to return this product. It doesnt absorb well enough nor does it hydrate my dry skin. It actually causes me to have more flakes than normal. * This is the second time I received a sample of face cream from this brand and yet again I didn't learn my lesson. breaking out in white heads and red and painful. * I love this moisturizer.

My skin looks so glowing and fresh, but never greasy and works great as a primer for make up truly a glass of water for my skin. * I just finished my first jar of the water cream hyaluronic glow moisturizer and I will be going back to Ulta to grab another one today. It is nice and light, great for daytime or nighttime wear. It absorbs so nicely and my skin feels super hydrated! * I've been trying to replace my Tatcha water cream bc its so expensive. This one, although not a dupe, is a good replacement. It leaves my skin soft, glowy, & hydrated. Be careful if you have oily skin‚Ä¶ you only need the tiniest dime-sized amount‚Ä¶ the jar could last you forever. If you use too much it could become oily and heavy. * Anything philosophy I love, so when I saw this it was a must try. It is AMAZING.

It's unfortunate that the price has sky rocketed * I love this moisturizer, but not the price lol. I managed to snag it during the 21 Days of Beauty and since I had a gift card I got it for cheap.

I used this stuff after I wash my face and I apply it before bed and wake up and my slim just looks so plumped and dewy. I love it! My husband even noticed my skin looked better. So that's a win. * I'm 14, and recently I've struggled with big pores, acne scars, and fungal acne. After two uses, my pores are getting smaller, scars fading, and almost completely acne free for the first time since I became a teenager! Telling all my friends! * My skin needs this product! This has been a holy grail product for years for me. It's lightweight, absorbs well, keeps my skin smooth & hydrated. * I've been using this for a couple months and at this point just trying to use up the bottle. this just sits on my skin and does not absorb. in the morning my skin feels slimy still when I wash it, but I feel like it does not moisturize well. I don't understand the hype. * I LOVE cosrx like absolutely obsessed with the snail mucin in every way, it changed my skin in ways I hadn't seen any other product do. This product was unfortunately a let down for me, entirely. It has the same consistency just a little heavier than the mucin, but it doesn't translate the same on the skin. It dries out super fast and dried my skin out to the same point as if you'd just started using retinol, it was that bad. Mind you I have combination skin and have never had a problem with getting too dry just sometimes too oily so I was completely shocked when this dried out my skin completely. It also sadly irritated my skin as well. I actually came to the reviews to see if anyone else had the same experience. * And to be clear, I did not use the product on my eyes. But after a few uses, my eye lids developed a crazy painful, eczema like rash. Never have I experienced such a reaction from a facial product. Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin or if you ever get eczema. * Love this for my skin, ive been using this for two or three years and still love it!"
29,dermalogica,intensive moisture balance moisturizer,pimprod2003120,2535727," * I gave this a try and I am so thrilled.  It is wonderful!   I am hooked with its level of moisture.  Others have be sitting on the surface but this one actually soaks into my skin and I can not say enough good things. * I have sensitive irrirated skin and while this moisturizer keeps my skin soft and hydrated, it smells disgusting. It has a very strong chemical odor. It also burns slightly on my skin. The product is expensive, and it's supposed to be made of quality ingredients; this is frustrating to say the least. Especially since so many people recommend this brand. * I was so hopeful for this with my dry skin. Sadly, it leaves me so greasy and shiny. The chemical smell is awful. * I have used this product for more than 20 years. And I love it. I wish they would start reproducing their other excellent product, Intensive Eye Repair * I come running back once I start using actives! Worth the money on a per ounce basis when compared to many drug store brands and consistently works well with my skin, especially when on retinol. And I love that they have two other weights of moisturizers for when I'm not testing my skin barriers last nerve! * Lovr this stuff. Loggteright but actually moisturizes. Would buy again * It is easy to use.  A little goes a long way, so you don't have to use a lot.  It makes my face feel good, not greasy or tight."
30,la roche-posay,toleriane double repair matte face moisturizer for oily skin,pimprod2030179,2591830," * I'm very oily, i use the gel cleanser and this, problem solved. * Hey, so I overall like this product. The pilling I noticed is caused when I touch my skin, so it has been very helpful for me to get myself to not touch my face. Personally, the way I help with the pilling is to apply the moisturizer on a damp face, not a dry one. I also like to mix the product on my hands really nicely and apply it, not just put some on my hand and apply. I like to mix it up really good, and I have noticed it helps a lot to almost completely rid of the problem. * I understand its a matte moisturizer but its the equivalent of putting a matte lipstick on your face. I love this brand but this is a no for me. If you prefer dry skin this is definitely for you * I was so excited for this moisturizer because it had a good review from Wirecutter and I really needed a moisturizer that wouldn't make me look greasy!
My skin is acne prone and oily on my forehead and to the left and right of my nose but very dry under my nose and on my upper lip and chin. I was happy with how this moisturizer made my skin look (matte but not dull) and that it worked well on both the dry and oily parts of my face.
The unfortunate thing is that it pills a LOT, to the point that it bothers me enough that I don't want to wear it. I usually go barefaced and it still pills very badly. Putting sunscreen on top of it doesn't go very well and I imagine it would be worse with makeup. I'm really sad that it does this because I loved the product otherwise but now I have a nearly full tube of it that I can't wear which is a huge waste of money :( * I bought this product and put it on at night and woke up with red, patchy and it itchy skin and my skin feels like sandpaper, if you have sensitive skin- avoid this product:( * Its not formreally dry skin; i have normal skin, but with majorly large pores from years of extreme oiliness and sun damage. I was so sick of all koisturizers making my skin look worse, and now I have finally found the one that doesn't make me break out, and doesnt look shiny. I'm 62, for the record. Tip: don't tey to rub it in all the way or else it will pill. Just apply it, massage it a little bit, and let it soak in and dry on your skin. * please stop using the term ""peels"" whhen you mean it PILLS
beside that, word of advice use it on damp skin
that may help and if it still continues to PILL make sure you're using all your skincare ok DAMP TO WET SKIN
this moisturizer is great don't let other's user error influence you"

I got it for kp on my legs and rough elbows and it really helps. * This used to work amazingly but they have changed the formula. It's now ineffective and overpriced Lubriderm. Does anyone know if Ulta has old stock formula they have purchased recently? I tried to find question section. So purchase if they have original * In my constant quest for skincare products that deliver real results, I recently tried the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid. This lotion claims to gently exfoliate, boost cell turnover, and provide deep hydration to uncover softer, smoother skin. Let's dive into my experience with this multi-tasking formula.

The lotion is non-greasy and lightweight, making it perfect for daily use. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and hydrated without any heavy residue. The product is fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for those with sensitive skin or a sensitivity to strong scents. The natural smell from the lactic acid salts is subtle and varies slightly depending on your skin's unique pH, but it's not overpowering or unpleasant. * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is revolutionary! It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body."

People have asked me what I use and I'm quick to tell them. * Dermalogica, you shoukd be ashamed. Your proce has consustently increased i er the last decade, doubling since I began using it. Why? * Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated, without a greasy feeling. * I recently got a facial and was chatting with my esthetician about moisturizers. I typically use the Drunk Elephant moisturizer, I have never had any issues with it but after my facial I thought I would look into something different. I have normal skin, not too dry not too oily. Within a couple of days I had horrible deep breakouts under my skin and something that looked like a rash down my neck. I know everyones skin reacts differently but this was not for me. Returned and went back to my drunk elephant. * I love this moisturizer. My esthetician suggested I use this to balance my combination skin, and it has been really helpful! It's definitely a better option than the benefit porefessional I was using before. * This is a fine moisturizer but my skin is no smoother after 9 months of daily use. Probably not worth the price. * I'm very impressed with how long my face stayed moisturized. All night! Wish it was more affordable however"

It feels better on my skin than any other product I've used and smells like a rose petal.  Top of the line product.  I will buy this as long as they continue to make it. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Incredible. I went out and bought more. And one for my mom and sister. It smells amazing and hydrates my skin so well. It doesn't make me breakout which is rare for me. Totally worth it. * After about a week of using it just in the morning, my skin breaks out and turns bumpy. I think it's the acid in it. * Love this face cream! I have been using it for years. * It feels so luxurious and is super hydrating. I definitely saw a difference in my skin (not as dull). Because I love this product so much, i'd buy the refills. I've gotten two so far and i feel like they've skimped a lot. 10% less in price but i feel like they only give you 80% of the 1.7oz which is a bummer. It also smells like sunscreen which i dont particularly love * it was fantastic but it was very expensive, packing was fancy, and the only ting I hate about it is that I is super expensive"

It works well. It's good for the skin. I always buy more of it. Can't live without it and you can use it with other skin care. * It smells so terrible that I thought it had gone bad. I exchanged it for another with the same result. 
I don't know how well the product may or may not work because the scent is so horrible I could not continue putting on my face. Rancid * I'm so surprised by the quality of this product. Feels like cheap, thick silicone. I wasn't expecting this from a brand like Est√©e Lauder. If you try it, keep an eye on the return window so you don't get stuck with bad expensive moisturizer. * This moisturizer is hands down.The best one i've ever purchased and used. I feel like a little bit goes a long way, and I genuinely feel as though I see a difference in my skin immediately. I love it so much, I bought one for my mother well! * After 1 month of use this is NOT for me. I have DRY mature skin so I am use to applying a thicker, richer formulation but this one just doesn't spread well. After 1 month no difference. I am disappointed because of the cost, have had better results with less expensive creams, of which I will go back too. Also I wish I could upload a picture I took of a big gap in the container, it's an air pocket therefore product is missing. * Love the creaminess of the moisturizer."

However, what's in there does wonders for my skin, which is dry and mature.  It drank it in and within the first day I'm seeing results that all the other ""triple peptide"" moisturizers I've tried didn't produce.  This is slightly sticky so I'm using it before bed, not under makeup.  This is a great moisturizer to refresh your face after you've cleaned it for the evening and need to rebuild the moisture.  It's priced right and I'm super happy I purchased it spur of the moment. * I've purchased this moisturizer twice now and I love it. It's a pretty good moisturizer for the price and It lasts a good amount of time. I have sensitive skin and it didn't make me breakout or cause any skin irritation! Although this product is great, I don't think I'll be purchasing it again, just because there are some other moisturizers that I like a little more. overall, I definitely recommend this product! * I have combo oily skin and this is the best moisturizer I have tried. I apply it after toner and serum, and I notice that this moisturizer doesn't pill for me. It leaves my skin feeling nice and soft after drying. After using for 2+ weeks, haven't had any breakouts either * I did like this moisturizer, but i dont think it did much for me. I didnt notice a difference in my skin after using it, had to switch out the moisturizer. This is probably the only byoma product i dont really like * The product dispenses very nicely and the texture is what im looking for in a gel moisturizer. I hate the packaging because its super bulky and i assume this is becauae its hiding how much product is included. The smell is also kind of gross. For a summer moisturizer, its serving its purpose * Me gusto!! No deja sensaci√≥n grasosa, si lo volveria a comprar!! Like thiss * I had difficult getting this moistuizer to pump out of the bottle. I unscrewed the cap and discovered that the pump is extremely short. It just barely clears the inside of the cap and doesn't reach to the bottom of the bottle.

Absorbs very quckly and layers well with serims and under makeup. My skin stayed hydrated all winter with no redness, patches or flakes. This is meant for very dry skin so if you don't have it, then try one of DE's lighter versions. I'm buying my third soon but it only takes a minimum amount. Highly recommend. * Reaction immediately skin started burning and a rash developed. * Broke out immediately * I absolutsly hate the pump for this and have serious questions about who approved it, the packaging is cute though. Absolutely love the product though, it makes my skin feel so smooth and my face immediately is visibly less inflamed * I've never been this happy with a skin care product. It's so cold and dry out right now and my face has really been struggling. Dry, flaky, red, splotchy, itchy. I tried so many other products but nothing was helping. I've been sleeping with a humidifier but that isn't helping either. Then I tried this product - the overnight change was unbelievable. One use and my face looked and felt so much better.

38,av√É¬®ne,cicalfate+ restorative protective cream,pimprod2020798,2577161," * Before last night I would have given this product 5 stars. I have been using a free sample size container of this for my sensitive face eczema for over a year. I loved it and bought a full size end of last year, but did not open it until last night. I was shocked when a lot of blue water came out when squeezing product out. I tried shaking and squeezing the container to remix, as that usually works. Yet nope it's still very separated. 
This is very disappointing because I loved the product. I would caution to only buy in person so you can shake it to listen for the separation. Or make sure you at least open it right after buying. Even though the product is faulty, I am past the return window so I'm losing money by throwing it out. 
I doubt I would buy this again because I would rather support a new product than one with known issues. Not sure if its a batch or formulation issue, or extreme temperatures during transportation that causes the separation sometimes, but Av√®ne or Ulta need to figure it out. Very disappointing!! * I have rosacea and eczema so it is extremely hard to find products that work for my face. I bought this as a moisturizer and it did okay, I just don't like how hard it is to spread and it makes my face super itchy. I used it for probably a month or two before I couldn't handle the itching then threw it at the back of the drawer. I like that it never burned the area below my eyebrows and didn't cause more breakouts than my normal. I knocked off a star for the itching but gave it 4 stars because it saved my face:

I used a new face moisturizer (Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Balm) and had the most outrageous reaction on my face, neck, and upper chest, everywhere I applied it. My mom said my face looked like it had been chemically peeled it was so red and shiny looking. My skin felt tight, it burned, and I wanted to scratch my skin off it itched so badly. I remembered this cream and decided to try it (cleansed with Cetaphil cream cleanser and applied just this) and it took a few hours but the redness went down and the tightness lessened. I just had intensive itching (this probably magnified because it made me itch in general) which required me to then apply aveeno baby eczema balm on top to fix it. Because I have rosacea, I can't use steroids on my face so had to use the aveeno. This stuff is a life savor for most of the side affects of a skin reaction, so I am glad to have it on hand! * Ive dealt with sensitive skin ALL my life and when I started getting into skincare it felt impossible to find the right product to meet all my needs and wants but this stuff is so GOOD. It is thick so more for dry skin and if you love a dewy glow but still i find it EASY to really rub (just takes a tad bit effort) in like very buttery but you do have to take your time. Discovered this product and its so good i GO THROUGH ALOT and ive noticed this did clear my skin and smooth my texture (i dont suffer from major acne). Now, i will say im a fellow brown skin gal and you do have to wait a second for it to really sit and soak in‚Ä¶texture is good just rub in really well and let it sit for like 3-5 minutes so it doesnt leave a white cast‚Ä¶.TRUST IVE LEARNED MY LESSON. Overall very moisturizing and great price! * I can't sing the praises of this enough. It hydrates my skin and makes my skin look as glasslike as it can. My husband can't even believe it is my skin. He thought my picture was filtered until I came home and he saw for himself. * This calmed my severe eczema flare up within HOURS. During the time when all my other standard prod uts started burning my skin, i bought this on recommendation and it has made all the difference. Scaly skin was immediately moisturized and did not come back hours later. redness relieved and my flare yo was barely noticeable 12 hours later. I also did not need to constantly reapply. AMAZING * I was hesitant to purchase this after the reviews talking about it separating. But I was having a ton of issues with dry, irritated, skin out of nowhere. I took a chance and could not recommend this more. I shook the container in advance to hear if there was separated liquid, then also massaged the tube to make sure it was completely mixed together before opening. I used this on my face and woke up with very moisturized skin. I think it is going to make a huge difference in my dermal barrier. I paired it with the lip version as well. If you're on the fence, buy it! * Arrived completely separated. Had to stick in hot water for 15 min and shake vigorously to recombine. Continued to slowly reseparate over the course of a couple weeks. Have a feeling i did not use it with the intended texture."

This one by far the best one ive tried and the only one to proivde consistent results. * This cream makes my sensitive skin soft and smooth.

While it has a nice texture and the ingredients look fabulous, this cream resulted in the worst allergic reaction I've ever experienced. After two uses, my skin was visibly red, tingly, textured, and incredibly itchy. Unfortunately think this damaged my barrier as my skin is still recovering using other tried and tested products. If you have sensitive skin, I'd skip. * Oh how I wanted to love this. The ingredient list looks nice, and I'd heard good reviews, but unfortunately this cream just did not work out for me. I have no idea what's causing it, but this moisturizer somewhat burns my skin every time I apply it. It also seems to be making my facial eczema worse. The texture is different, more of a whipped consistency, but still hydrating. I feel like my skin might need more moisture though. It's also expensive for what it is. Unfortunately it's too late for me to return it, and since it was pricey I'm going to use it up anyways, but I would not repurchase. Honestly you can find many just as good-if not better face creams out there with similar ingredients, that cost much less. * Made skin dry and itchy, not moisturizing. * I use this over the mad hippie super A serum, at night before I go to work. And I love this product. I don't use it twice a day but you probably could if you wanted to. This also feels like a rich moisturizer after I use the mad hippie enzyme scrub, it just makes my skin feel wonderful. I have acne prone skin and also wanted something good for anti aging, since 30 was approaching. * I wanted to love this product. I wanted a night cream with collagen & this has mostly good reviews. But the morning after the 1st time using it, I had 2 huge red zits (which is unlike my normal skin). Every time I use it, I break out the next morning. * Love how soft this cream makes my face feel!

I only need to blot once a day at work instead of three! * I have used FAB products before. Always liked their daily moisturizer but i have oily skin so it didn't help, but this oil control moisturizer helps a lot. My skin doesn't look as shiny. Perfect product for summer. It is not heavy at all. * In my search for an oil-free moisturizer this was recommended. I used this for a month and loved it. No breakouts, controlled my oily skin and seemed to work really well. So, I stocked up and got more. I noticed something was different after the 3rd use of the new jar. I started breaking out. I haven't broken out in almost 3 years. I was confused and continued to use it because why would it start breaking me out now? I loved the first jar. I'm not sure if the formula changed or if my skin is just being finicky. 

Overall, I recommend the product because it seems to be very good. It's a struggle for us oily girls to find products that offer us a balance of hydration while keeping oil at bay. I hope it works for you if you try it :) * Ever since Neutrogena discontinued their Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin - my holy grail of moisturizers - I have been desperately searching for a replacement that will keep my breakouts under control without over-drying my skin. The search is finally over - this is it!! My skin starting clearing up and looking healthier after the first overnight application! I've now been using it for 2 months and it's continued to significantly reduce my breakouts (in frequency and duration) without drying out my skin. The only downside is that the container is about half the size I was assuming it would be, based on other FAB products I've purchased. (Although that's on me for not looking at the size printed on the front of the product.) Each container lasts me a little over 2 months with one application per day on my face and sometimes neck and/or chest. Honestly though I'm in love. * Ive used this product for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin and have used several different face moisturizers over the years and this is the only one that keeps my face from getting super shiny by the end of the day, even with serums underneath it. It WORKS so to me its worth every penny! * This is the best moisturizer I have ever found for my oily skin! I have an oily t-zone and this keeps my skin from becoming oily all day. I worked an 8-hour shift wearing this and when I got home my forehead was still dry, but not peeling, it just felt finally normal. I use this on my entire face, but keep in mind you can use it only in certain areas that you struggle with oil, so don't let other reviews about dry skin deter you. With winter coming up I may begin to only use this on my oily areas and another moisturizer on others, but this is literally the holy grail moisturizer for anyone struggling with oily skin. * I have combination skin and this has saved my skin texture and made it so soft. The consistency feels so nice and it's not overly drying even in my dry areas. Feel like it's reduced some redness as well."

48,beautycounter,countercontrol matte effect gel cream,pimprod2038172,2606559," * If you truly have oily skin, you know the difference in a review from someone with oily skin vs someone whos skin gets oily.  I have oily skin and probably spend upwards of $1K a year on products trying to find things that actually do as they claim, and this is one of them.

I was a little reluctant to purchase this as the price is pretty high for a brand I've never used, but I'm glad that I took the risk on it.  Prior to this moisturizer I was either using none at all (because most others just make me more oily, dont need redundant products on oily skin), or I was using the La-Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Matte one which didn't do much for me. Obviously how this will work for you is going to be different for everyone, and the other products you use prior to your moisturizer will make a difference as well.

For reference I am a 28 yr old female, white/Caucasian.  My morning routine is: wash with a clay based cleanser (Dermalogica), tone (Fenty Skin), hyperpigmentation serum (Good Molecules), niacinamide/zinc serum (Sunday Riley), then this moisturizer. The consistency of this product is great for oil as it is a gel based product, but it comes out more opaque white than clear which is fine. It does not have much of a fragrance that I have noticed, but I'm not sensitive to fragrance so I wouldn't be one to say. When I put this on it almost feels as if it is a crossover between a moisturizer and a makeup primer that blurs your pores.  Now it does not make your pores go away by any means, but it does HELP.  Immediately after applying my skin is definitely mattified but again, not completely shine free as if it is a primer with the sole purpose of making your skin look like it has powder on it. It does not make my skin feel tight and dried out, it genuinely makes me feel moisturized and smooth without the glowy look that normal moisturizers do. From my experience it definitely does not keep me matte for 8 hours, I would say after about 3-4 hours I start to see shine on my face to the point where I feel the need to blot if I were going out somewhere (this is all without wearing makeup or anything on top of my morning skin routine, I work from home).

If you truly have an oily/combo skin type this is not going to be your holy-grail product that makes all of your problems disappear (will continue to search for it), but if it is within your budget for a product of this type then this is 100% top 5 best moisturizers for oily skin on the market right now in my opinion after having used this for a few weeks now.  Would repurchase (and I rarely ever find products I do)!  

I also just want to throw out there that I did buy this on my own, was not asked/paid to write this, and I think this is either my only review I've ever written on Ulta or one of a few over a span of years that I don't even remember. * The packaging is very luxe but the pump feels like its empty and its still half full. It doesn't mattify anything but it is a nice mix of a gel and lotion and a lightweight moisturizer. This is an MLM and I do feel it's overpriced for what it is. It's pretty basic. * Matte effect that works great as a moisturizer/ primer for oily skin types"
49,good molecules,lightweight daily moisturizer,pimprod2023937,2582316," * I struggle a lot with oily skin so a lot of times moisturizers make my skin feel too oily, but the lightweight moisturizer helps the dryness without being overly thick and oily, makes my skin feel light and clean! * I've tried a few other Good Molecules products and really liked them.  This is no exception - it's lightweight, as the name says, but very hydrating, in my opinion. It absorbs nicely, too, and didn't break me out.  For the price, it's amazing. I got the travel size, but I'll be getting the large one. * Does not pill, very hydrating * I feel like with so many moisturizers now a days it is all grease and no moisture. With this product that is not the case. It is moisturizing without feeling oily for a great price! * I do wish the scent was a little better. It helps with my oily skin tremendously! * I started using this product and wanted to believe the hype, but this product, as much as it claims to be ""lightweight,"" was not. Upon application, my pores instantly felt clogged, and I ended up with more acne than when I started. Save your money!!!! * This product keeps my skin moisturized. I like it's creamy, smooth texture, and it doesn't leave a greasy finish at least not for me. It's been just what my skin needed!"

It is helping with my chin are being so dry it peels in the morning * Great product. * I recently started getting eczema on my face. This moisturizer cleared it up on the first application! * My husband uses this cream on his face. He loves it."

At first I was using too much and it pilled on me. Using the proper amount gives all dsy hydration. * I am a devout Chanel Sublimage fan but wanted to try a ""clean"" line. This product listed shea as an ingredient as does the aforementioned. Well, my skin hasn't been clearer, pores smaller, literally no makeup other than a mineral spf. I'm stunned with the results in two weeks. Please try this if you have combo or dryish skin...young or mature. * I use IT face cream and love it but wanted to more moisture in my skin.  this product is amazing and I am so glad I found it.  Makes my skin feel so soft.  Love it!! * This moisturizer is moisturizing, however there are better, less expensive great ones out there.  I have used it for about a month and I do not notice anything amazing that would justify the price or a repurchase. * I cannot use this brands skincare and makeup products. I am very allergic to the products * Absolutely HATE this cream. Made my skin break out in tiny pimples that I am having a hard time getting rid of. They started 2 days after starting this cream. * Love this! I ha e been us8ng BC for years and so happy ulta now has if."
54,belif,the true cream - aqua bomb hydrating moisturizer,pimprod2043259,2619876," * I got a trial size sample in one of the gift sets and fell in love. I bout the Aqua Bomb because it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. * I have only used it one time and I usually do my skincare routine during the evening, after been using Dermalogica for quite some time and recently realizing that I needed to try out some other products (for price reasons). I came across this online and decide to give it a try. The first night I used the moisturizer my face felt the most hydrated it has in quite some time. The smell isn't bad in my opinion, but I really like the water based texture from this moisturizer. A little goes a long ways as well! My skin is normally combination of oily and dry but some days it has a mind of its own whether one day it wants to be dry and then another day it wants to be oily. I wish it would last all day as I have applied it in the morning before I went to work, but then I also sweat at work all the time. I will definitely be buying this again. * I have sensitive dry skin now my skin used to be very oily with aging. My skin has changed. I got this as a gift. I tried it very similar to the Neutrogena Hydro boost smells great. It's moisturizing, but not too thick which I hate thick greasy moisturizer definitely a win. * This leaves your skin feeling super moisturized but not heavy like some creams can. It smells good and leaves my skin feeling freshly moisturized for a long time. I just wish it was more affordable. * I use this lightweight moisturizer daily after I wash my face. I like how it isn't greasy at all and has a pleasant, light fragrance. * Love how this feels on my face! It's refreshing and I personally feel comfortable not putting makeup on afterwards!! * This moisturizer has a great texture and seeps into the skin well. However, if you are sensitive to smell, this might be too much for you. I cannot get over how it smells like Pledge dust cleaning spray."

56,supergoop!,triple prep weightless multitasking moisturizer spf 40 face sunscreen,pimprod2043911,2620576," * I'm a fair-skinned man who has been looking for a daily moisturizer/SPF combo for years that does not irritate my eyes as the day goes on. This was recommended to me by a coworker and an Ulta employee separately. I've been using it for a year and swear by it - I like that it doesn't have a scent, moisturizes well, and most importantly, has NEVER irritated my eyes. This is my go to. Cannot recommend enough. Love it so much that I've gifted it to my siblings. * I have used other products of this brand and was hoping this would be a one treatment before makeup. Unfortunately it created a peeling like feeling combined with my makeup which has never happened before. 

I also feel like it makes my face red. 

The one thing I like most is the design, jar allows you to get every drop of product which is appreciated! * I've tried applying this alone and with my regular skincare routine and it pills up under makeup no matter what. Seems fine alone but still got kind of peely on the neck. * The first half of this jar was perfect but the closer i got to being halfway through this product it began to pill. Was pretty upset * This is my fIrst review. I have spent thousands on skincare for fine lines and milia. I have had lasers, injections, etc. This cream has completely erased my fine lines and almost completely eradicated years of milia around my eyes. I have my best friend hooked and I will never purchase a different cream. With that being said, it is not for sensitive skin. In my experience, anything that is this effective is not going to be gentle. I do not have sensitive skin. I can feel some burn, but no redness or reaction. I am 48 and I now have my skin back from my early 30s. I only wish that i would have had this then. * I haven't had any issues with this product besides the fact that it has a pretty bad smell to it so it's not enjoyable to put on. * I was super excited to use this moisturizer as it had SPF in it. But I am utterly disappointed. It caused severe eye irritation that i had to go see an ophthalmologist. No sunscreen has caused me such reaction so i was worreid. However i do think it's a good moistirozer with SPF but its just not for me."

I know the reviews aren't good but; I had a  free sample of the face wash first, so I knew i would like it. I would say this if u don't like scented or oil on ur face, then pass on this. I love alot of moisturizer on my face so it doesn't bother me at all! Also I have eczema and it doesn't break me out although it's scented üò≥ I love it! Love it! * Sometimes when I buy kits, I'll use most of them (but not all of them). With this kit, I use every single one of the products in here and I LOVE them! * I am SO VERY HAPPY I was able to purchase this set for my BIRTHDAY MONTH!!!!!  I am officially 51 years old.  My skin is incredibly HAPPY!!!!!  I have used TULA products for the past 6 years and when i saw this particular set on sale during the 21 days of beauty I HAD TO BUY IT!!!!!!!!  PLUS i was able to use my 20% off AND my ULTA REWARDS!!!!!!  So i got this for a STEAL!!!!!  OK so NO More bragging about me.  TULA has some of the ABSOLUTE BEST ANTI AGING AND SPECIFIC ROUTINE ADDRESSING PRODUCTS!!!!!!   I have had issues with drying skin around my mouth (upper area to chin).  And i have used everything under the sun!  However when i got to use the TULA 24/7 cream:  I WAS INCREDIBLY HAPPY!!!!!!!!!  Finally my skin is HYDRATED AND FEELING WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!  And I not oily on my forehead or nose!!!!!!!!!!  Love, LOVE TULA PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!! * This product made my oily face feel even greasier. * I did not like any product in this bundle. The facial cleanser doesn't get makeup off well. The moisturizer left my skin greasy, The brightening undereye stick didn't do anything but make my concealer go on wrong. * I love tula and a lot of there products however, definitely try one of there products before getting this bundle! I have sensitive skin and rosacea, i tried there firming moisturizer first before i bought this to see if i would have a reaction to tula products
The bundle is definitely a great deal and so far i have no issues or no break outs, its been a week! * Tula has helped my skin so much! I was scared to use it at first because my skin is so sensitive! But since ive been using i dont get big painful breakouts anymore! My skin is clear, soft, and glowing! I also used to have the little sweat bumps on my face, completely gone since using this! It did take about two weeks to see the results! So if you wait youll see the difference! On month 3 of using it!"

This is it! Love the clean ingredients and that it doesnt have much of a smell. My husband has even started using it, and that is saying something. * I have tried so many moisturizers. I have sensitive skin and I am also very careful with certain ingredients I use on my skin. This is the best moisturizer, it's hydrating but not greasy and great for day or night. I just mix it with my sunscreen in the morning. * I wanted to love this moisturizer because its clean- I didn't even mind the smell even though some complain about it. But I noticed after several weeks of use, I had many blackheads on my nose and chin. I didn't realize it wasn't non-comedogenic so that was on me for not paying attention. If you have acne or get breakouts, I wouldn't recommend this. * I wish the people who get the products for FREE other wise known as influencers would just be honest. I found it no big deal I've used other products for alot less money, but the 5 ‚≠ê crews won't be getting free stuff if they don't give a high score. Wait a few weeks to buy it and if you don't like return it, so this is an HONEST review. * Love it!! * I highly recommend this! I kept finding moisturizers that either broke me out or pilled on my face (deal breaker). This one does neither and keeps my face moisturized. It is on the pricey side, but I bought it on sale. The only thing I don't love is the smell. At first it just smells like nothing, but once I rub it in it's almost a chemical smell? Not sure, but I'll take that over not breaking me out. * It goes on like silk and makes your face feel soft and smooth. Feels good after I put on my toner and serums and then it's like a nice after finish. Good smell. Overall the best moisturizer I've used. Somewhere between a gel and a cream"
59,olehenriksen,strength trainer peptide boost moisturizer,pimprod2042287,2617224," * Didn't do anything to my skin feels very heavy * The texture is heavy. I use it at night before bed. * This is my go-to night moisturizer for the winter. It has a light fragrance, and has never caused a break out. I've gone through 4 containers and anticipate using many more! * It is refreshing and leaves your skin feeling soft not sticky and now I have my husband using it too and he loves it. * I have been using this moisturizer for years and, it's the best in my opinion - it isn't heavy or makes your face feel weighted down - great for everyday use! * hear me out, this is for the crack dry skin that also needs moisture. 
lots of heavy stuff is very oil based and doesn't moisturize well, this moisturized and locked it in better than other feet creams I've tried (I would hope, the price is 4x)
Used it on my feet and finally felt my feet deage and move so freely.
Can't use this on my face though, since I'm acne prone. if I did, the tiniest amount will do, so I would need to warm it up in my hands from a long while before applying the melted balm. * As someone with persistently dry skin, finding a moisturizer that truly hydrates and smooths my complexion has been a journey. I was pleasantly surprised by the OLEHENRIKSEN StrengthTrainer Peptide Boost Moisturizer. The Texture is wonderfully lightweight and provides an immediate cooling sensation upon application. It absorbs quickly. Most importantly, it effectively quenched my dryness throughout the day, and I did notice a smoother texture after consistent use."

I used this then a thicker cream on top at night. * Its so hydrating and glowy and definitely re perching!üòÅ * Its so hydrating and glowy and definitely re perching!üòÅ * My daughter loves this I've taken this from her multiple times it is very gentle and hydrating * I have acne prone skin and always look for lightweight moisturizers that won't make me too oily or break me out. this moisturizer is fragrance free and doesn't clog my pores. leaves skin with a nice, dewy look without being heavy or sticky. just taking one star off because it's almost too lightweight and feels more like a toner than a moisturizer! * Again amazing product so lightweight on the skin and I love it. Because I and 9 and it's hard to find a kids mostuizer so I love this one Bubble did an amazing job with this cloud surf  water cream moisturizer"

It provides the skin with hydration without the feeling of stickiness or oiliness throughout the day. Way better than my Tatcha Water Cream. Will repurchase this one to wear in the AM! * I have had oily or combination skin my whole life. Never used moisturizer before, since my face looks very youthful and most moisturizing products made me break out. I older now, and need moisturizer-this is the best product ever! * It really does leave your skin looking like glass! And no oil buildup throughout day. I breakout using just about anything on my face, I have not broken out once in 6 months using this brands glass skin line. * I breakout from just about anything, I have not broken out once using this for about 5 months. And it really does make your skin look like glass! * Perfect lightweight moisturizer for hot summer days! * Heard some good reviews about it and I also happened to try their cleanser once and I liked it so I decided to give this a try and after a few days of using I BROKE OUT so bad. All around my face and under chin. My money just went to waste. SO DISAPPOINTED"

Hoping my old regimen will repair this soon ü§û * I really love this stuff. I used a sample on vacation and it made my skin GLOW. I ended up buying the full size just because of that. My skin has been much less irritated and it LOVES these ingredients. I think this is part of my magic routine for acne and irritation * Loving how this product has helped with rosacea and my sensitive skin. Feels hydrating and calming for nightly treatments. * I have always loved and trusted Dermalogica products. The stabilizing repair cream is my favorite of all of them because it's so calming on the skin. My husband actually uses it after shaving and it helps with the redness. He won't use anything else on his face now. * I have been dealing with some dermatitis and I have stripped my skin care down to cleansing and moisturizer.  The moisturizer was not doing much to keep my sensitive combination skin hydrated so I gave this a try with 100% on my Yuka app, i thought why not. I was a it nervous to try something new and I am glad i gave it a try. Let me tell you, I saw a major improvement from just one application. I hate the cost but I am loving the results. I am 47 and have been using it for a week, I can usually tell if I something will work with my skin within a few days because of how sensitive it is. This was a winner for me. * I had a retinol bad reaction and created redness and texture in ALL my face, with a gentle cleansing and this cream it healed in just a few days. * This is the perfect step for clean beauty skin.

I feel as we age, our skin changes anyway, but I never thought a gel would be better for my dry skin. This one is truly like water for my face. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The texture is very smooth and it's very cooling. I like that the moisturizer is very gentle.

This is the only moisturizer I am able to continually use that actually works for my skin. I am dry and acne prone. 
I will usually develop irritations to products as I continue to use them (just some examples - La Roche Posay cleanser, Cocokind moisturizers, Clinique moisturizers, Aveeno oat cleaners, First Aid Beauty moisturizer, the list goes on with high end and drugstore products that end in irritation and sometimes acne flares). 
This cream can be Applied during my most irritated times and does not burn one bit. This is truly the only item i am extremely loyal to and recommend to EVERYONE. * This is amazing for rosacea and sensitive skin. * I almost exclusively use Avene at this point because I break out with the teeniest of fragrances. As I've gotten older, my rosacea has taken center stage. This calms it down. A tube lasts months. This lays perfectly under every makeup I use with no pilling. I don't tend to wear tons of foundation because my skin is absolutely radiant, but I can use full coverage MAC, Tarte, Dior, it all goes on flawlessly.  I layer different skincare year round but this is my always moisturizer. * I've tried many moisturizers and serums to fix my skin barrier after I destroyed it doing a 10 step care routine. So far, this works to make my cheeks less red without giving me acne. It also lessened a wrinkle caused by an acne scar. * I originally bought this product when it was on sale. I liked it well enough, but it ended up taking a backseat to my other well-loved lotions and creams. Then I got pregnant and developed cystic acne on my chin that was painful, and I couldnt get it to go away. I tried switching out my favorite Cerve nighttime cream for this Avene cream and OMG those large, deep pimples cleared up in a matter of days!

This is an effective, affordable product! * I am not a beginner in case of retinols. This doesnt work for me. Probably it is too gentle for my 30 yr old face lol. The thrill to discover something so reasonably priced went away after using an entire tube only to find no difference. * I started breaking out within four days of using and I thought I was just purging. Continued to use it for three more weeks and my breakouts never slowed down. I stopped using it tor a week to see if my face just needed a break. It looked a little better, and i tried it last night and have two huge enormous new blemishes.  Do. Not. Use.  Check out reddit for more people with my experience. * I have sensitive skin prone to breaking out in a rash, but this was definitely gentle enough for my skin. I'm 35, pale, struggle with rosecea and some acne and have mild signs of aging and sun damage. I use this about 3-4 times a week with zero problems. I use a scentless basic hydrating moisturizer after and in the morning I use a salicylic acid and aloe gel and a rose infused moisturizer and havent had any issues. ther w were some minor breakouts at first, but ive read thats normal. * So I've tried so many retinol creams and serums and I can easily say this one is my absolute favorite! And for that price! It's so gentle and doesn't make my skin react, not even in winter when my skin is already dry. It keeps my skin looking bouncy and bright. I use azaleic acid in the morning, and this at night, and it keeps my skin acne free! I have had many two pimples in the last 6 months. Genuinely can't recommend this product enough! * this does not dry out your skin , it also helps acne scars and any acne that forms disappear over night ! * I've tried a couple different times to incorporate retinols into my skincare routine but I have INCREDIBLY sensitive skin. Each time I tried my skin would break out into an irritated rash and become super damaged in just one or two uses. I saw this one claimed to be gentle and it was super affordable so I gave it a try and its worked great! I had to incorporate it very slowly over a few weeks into my skincare routine but now I can apply it almost nightly with no problems. And my skin definitely looks brighter and I've noticed some of my fine lines and scars have faded a bit after using it now for about 6 months. At such an affordable price point, this product is definitely worth a shot for people trying to use retinol for the first time or people with ultra sensitive skin like me."

It's the only new product I'd added to my routine, and immediately upon stopping I didn't see any new acne and the existing acne started to subside. As a more minor complaint, I hated how it absorbed (or rather, didn't) into my skin. I tried applying on both damp and fully dry skin, and it just kind of sits there rather than absorbing. 

Context: I have dry, acne-prone skin, though I hadn't had a breakout for months prior to trying this product. I also live in a very dry climate. * It's fine. I dont find it as hydrating as the Matcha Antioxidant Cream they have. * As someone with combination skin, a lot of moisturizers make my oily skin too oily and my dry skin dry and flaky. This is the best moisturizer I've used in my life and it leave both my oil prone and dry skin feeling soft, smooth, and bouncy. It isn't greasy at all! 10/10 * I got this product due to a recommendation from an employee.  I had a bad reaction to a cream that used fermented apple and my eyes were peeling. This product not only healed my damaged skin, but also made it healthier than it had been within 10 days. Love This and will continue to use it going forward. * Amazing amazing amazing!

Also make me break out. * Works well * It feels really nice when applying and skin feels very hydrated right after. It does pill a lot. Also, by the end of the month using this product, my acne flared like crazy. I would recommend as hand cream or something so it doesnt go to waste. * I always try out different skin care brands in hopes of finding a new favorite. I purchased the mini size just in case I didn't liked it. Well, I absolutely hated this product. After getting out of the shower, applying toner, and serum, I applied the moisturizer. My eyes started watering and I thought it could have been that my eyes were dry. I did the same routine the very next day before work. By the time I had gotten to work, my eyes watering, tears down my face, burning, nose running, and sneezing. Throughout the day, my coworkers kept asking me if I was okay because my eyes were THAT SWOLLEN. I tried eye drops multiple times to wash out my eyes, it did not work. I went to the bathroom and finally decided to wash my face with water. I got some relief but, nothing really made my symptoms go away until I completely washed my face and took a benedryl. I recommend skipping this product entirely and going with Clinique moisture surge or a Pur moisturizer!!! * Always pills. nasty! * Thought this was a good brand. It still might be, but their moisturizer could be better * Loved this moisturizer, it doesn't add any de wines so if you naturally have oilier skin it is perfect."

I love the way it moisturizes and doesn't leave a greasy feel. Skin on my face feels so soft all day long. Had to buy a full size and now the gift one is in my travel bag. * My mother bought this product and I noticed it had a strong fragrance to it. Now I'm not a dermatologist, but I have enough knowledge to know that anything fragrance is horrible for your skin. Anyway, my skin broke out in hives when I tried this product, along with acne. Please don't buy skincare from Lancome, it's not the best for most people. * I love how this looks on my skin! It's matte but hydrating. Happy that it has hyaluronic acid as well. My makeup looks so good now! I used to use tatcha but didn't like oily it made my skin look. This will now be my go to! * I have normal to dry skin, but a lot of moisturizers will clog my pores if i sleep in them. I just stopped wearing a mositurizer to bed altogether for a while for this reason. When I saw the ingredients in this I became curious and decided to give it a try. My skin is so hydrated and looks beautiful in the morning! Also, if i develop a blemish during the day, I will still slap this moisturizer on top of it at night and not only does it not make it worse, it actually heals it and my skin clears up so much faster!

Ever since then, it's been me and my elf moisturizer against the world! It has never let me down. Even as an oily skin girl, this product has never made me feel greasy and nasty. I can feel the softness and hydration in my skin even into the next day after I've used this product. The hydration really lasts! * I bought this face cream because I'd been looking for an affordable moisturizer. I struggle with dryness around the mouth. I've been using it daily since purchasing. It's fragrance free (as advertised), and I haven't had any of that dryness since. Plus, it's cruelty free, which is a must for me. A little goes a long way. The packaging is great, and I love that it's recyclable. * I have periodically used Elf products & remember when they first came out with only 1 product!  This face cream is wonderfully gentle, fragrance-free (a BIG plus!), cruelty-free, & full of good ingredients!

This time, I had a serious allergic reaction that has lasted for a week. My lips got very swollen, and itchy, sore blisters appeared all over my body. Beware if you are sensitive to chemicals. * I loved how soft it made my skin and if you can tolerate it, it's a great product. Love Lancome. However, there is a strong fragrance to it and my sensitive skin got very irritated. I wish they made a fragrance free version, I would repurchase. Until then, I have to give it away * I hate to say it but this moisturizer burned on my face. It happened 2-3 times because at first I wasn't sure if it was this product or not. It does have a smell to it but I don't find it overpowering. For the few times I used it, it did seem to moisturize well. I'm glad this works for other folks :) * My girlfriend is trying it, because this is the wrong one that I bought.  She likes the day cream with 25 SPF. So far no complaints with her using it for a week now. I'm going to buy her the Lancome Aquagel SPF 50 for a base of her make-up and sun protection and see if they work well together.

For the price, you don't get enough product, and the formula is just not it‚Äîespecially for brown skin. It left a noticeable white cast and made me look gray and oily throughout the day. Even when I skip makeup, it still PILLS!!!, which is incredibly frustrating. I really wanted to like this, but it's just not working for me. Is it just me, or is this a common issue? Either way, I can't recommend it. * This is invisible but it's oily and breaks out your skin. * I know fragrance is not good for us but I tend to like scents. This one is just too much and too long. If Lancome had a frangrance-free option I would prefer it but returning because I can't get past the smell. Bought it during half off sale. I definitely wouldn't pay full price. * Great product * It's smooth lite smell one of my favorites * I was so excited to try this product but unfortunately it didn't work out for me. For reference I was in shade 420 N in their foundation. This product does indeed leave a white cast and makes me look grey. This product leaves me feeling very greasy and if you add even the slightest too much of the product it moves and disrupts foundation put on top of it.

It does a great job of hiding and protecting my dark spots to make sure they dont get worse or more gets added to my face. Keep this product around forever please! The 50 is my jam! Sensitive skin commemter here! :) * Tried it in store per the clinique associate and I really like it! It is on the thicker side but it spreads nicely and doesnt pill when paired with clinique moisture surge 100H or peach and lily's matcha moisturizer (my two HG moisturizers). You need your moisturizer to dry for 15 minutes and THEN apply your spf, this dramatically reduces it from pilling. It does look very orange when dispensed but it gives me a great sheer tint that looks like I put makeup on, its beautiful! So I wear alone typically on non-makeup days but does work very well as a primer as well (I use IT cosmetics CC+ foundation in light warm medium. For reference, I am also WN04 Bone in Clinique even better makeup so light/med and the tint works great for me. Wish it came in a bigger bottle!

I will not be running out of this all year round! Woohoo * Can't get over the tacky texture - not expected at this price point.

The lotion is non-greasy and lightweight, making it perfect for daily use. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and hydrated without any heavy residue. The product is fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for those with sensitive skin or a sensitivity to strong scents. The natural smell from the lactic acid salts is subtle and varies slightly depending on your skin's unique pH, but it's not overpowering or unpleasant. * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is revolutionary! It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day.

I struggle with redness, tiny pimples, itching and burning on my cheeks and forehead from rosecea. I applied this after my HA serum and it kept my itching, burning and spots away every day I used it. My skin felt so plump and hydrated, with slightly reduced redness. I'm saving up to put this amazing cream again. The texture is thick, but absorbed well.

HOWEVER, I wish they would change the pump lid....it works a few times and then stops.  You end up having to unscrew it just like a normal jar to get the moisturizer out.

It is pretty thick, so a little goes a long, way especially for the face. * Amazing for dry skin * Finally a moisturizing cream that lasts longer than 24 hrs.   My skin loves this product. * I wanted to love this moisturizer, I really did.

I have really dry skin around my eye area (like red, itchy, raised/inflames, peeling skin around the eyes in the winter), normal on the lower half of my face, and oily on the forehead. So im definitely a combination skin type, and i had heard great things about vanicream, and my sister uses it, so when i first got into skincare, I thought it would be a good option.

This moisturizer is SO THICK. Unbelievably thick. And hard to spread. 

I do an oil cleanse routine, as i have a lot of sebaceous filaments and clogged pores but not too much acne issues. I would oil cleanse, and use my toner. At this point in my routine, i would feel like my pores were so clear and my face was so shiny.

Then, i would apply my vanicream, and it was like my 10 minutes of previous skincare didn't exist. It's like i was watching the moisturizer clog my pores back up.

It also feels like this moisturizer never soaks in. Any contact my face has with any object just seems to get slimy again from the moisturizer, which is a big issue seeing as i wear glasses constantly and a cpap at night. So im constantly pushing my glasses back up and cleaning off the bridge, and my cpap just leaks in the middle of the night with mask farts because the silicone is slicked with moisturizer, even if i applied it 3 yours before bedtime.

I will say, i havent had issues with dry skin around my eyes since i started using it. So if you dont care to minimize pores or get rid of your sebaceous filaments, and are mroe worried about treating intense dry skin, go for it. This is your moisturizer. Otherwise, its almost like youre ruining the entire purpose of your skincare. * Everyone raves about how wonderful this stuff is so i thought I'd give it a try. It leaves your skin feeling horribly sticky! I've used it twice, thinking maybe i used too much this first time. Nope, still sticky and gross. So disappointed! * i use this as my moisturizer at night and it helps my dry skin so much! it lasts forever too. * I layer this on top of ny retinol at night wnd it keeps my face well moisturized"

I don't care about scent, but this is a very thick and heavy cream, absolutely not a moisturizer. doesn't wash off your hands well either because you can wash your hands and your eyes will water very badly. very disappointed in this product cause I normally use no. 7. * Can somebody tell me why this smells like wet cat litter? Not used cat litter.... new cat litter but wet. Like when you use it to swap up moisture. 

I guess it works okay even though it's really heavy for a day cream and I'm 53 so I wear heavy creams during the day! But the thickness of this is like a night cream, but of course night creams don't have sunscreen so weird. I just can't get past the smell so it's sort of doesn't matter how well it works. * I tried this as it was on sale. Been buying No. 7 for years. While the product felt great on my skin, there was an off scent I can only describe as throw-up. Really bad. My daughter concurred with me, and I ended up tossing it. Would not recommend. * When I opened this it smelled weird. I thought maybe it was old. I stirred it up and it still kinda smells but I am dealing with it. * been using this for 3 months and you can still see my hyperpigmentation. for a product so expensive I expect it to work in less than 3 months. I use the serum and the night cream as well and my skin still is not cleared up. * Received this as a full size sample.  It goes on super shiny and does not get absorbed into the skin, and I have oily skin as is, so I end up looking ridiculously oily and shiny all day.  Might be fine for someone with very dry skin but avoid if you're combo or oily * Fabulous product."

100,cerave,ultra-light facial gel with hyaluronic acid for all skin types,pimprod2039910,2611323," * Goes on light. However it doesn't feel very hydrating. I have sensitive combination skin. It really irritated my skin, and made my rosacea and eczema flair up. * there's a lot to like about this. I am diabetic so dry skin is a constant problem for me and I am very sensory sensitive, most lotion is difficult for me to use because of how it feels. 

This lotion absorbs fast, it's a gel so it's very lightweight, it doesn't leave that weird slimy feel that most lotions do, AND it's really helped my skin improve it's actual health. I use this during the day and at night I use the renewing one. That combination works the best of literally any facial lotion I've ever used. * I have oily skin and sweat a lot. I use this in the AM and PM paired with retinol, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and vitamin c serum. this is light enough to apply before SPF without feeli g too heavy. * Another good skincare product! The only downside is when you get down to the end, you can't really tell if you've used it all or not, so I keep pumping it. * I have been Cerave moisturizing cream for years as it has been the only cream that has worked for my dry eczema prone skin, so I thought I would give this a try. I have combination skin that is more on the oily side. I liked the texture and feel of this product. Unfortunately I ended up having a terrible reaction to it - red bumps all over my face. :( * I like that it's super light and does add a lot of moisture.  It also doesn't have sunscreen, which is what I was looking for.  (I always wear sunscreen outside, but if I'm just going to be inside at the office, I'd rather not have it.)  It's a little pricey for the volume.  Because it's the thick plastic tube, you think you're getting more than you are.  Mine is depleting quickly.  I also wish it had different packaging in general, environmentally. * I have used this for almost a year now and my skin loves it!   My skin is very dry and sensitive, so I can only use certain products.    This is an awesome product, it helps with dryness and is not heavy or greasy.  Your skin can still breathe after using this, it's so light and refreshing."

Not too heavy but covers perfectly. * It contains 3 highly pore-clogging ingredients for acne prone skin! Alcohol, shea butter, and coconut! Beware if you have acne. I tried it once and it broke me out! Now I've spent weeks trying to clear up my skin. * I went into Ulta looking for a new, clean face cream, eye cream and face tint. Ended up buying all of that and the primer. I've been using it all for 5 days now. My skin has never been dryer!! It's all going back! Almost $300 and, for me, it's awful. * Based on the reviews, wanted to try out something new. I was in search of a better moisturizing cream. This wasn't it. First off, is it me or does it smell like Windex? The worst part, ended up with some serious cystic acne. And I'm over 60 years old! Extremely disappointed. Would not recommend."

My skin feels firmer, smoother, and hydrated all day long, and it gives a silky satin finish that makes makeup glide on effortlessly. I love that it combines anti-aging benefits with SPF protection, so I feel like I'm taking care of wrinkles while shielding my skin from the sun. The subtle rose and mimosa scent is a lovely touch, and the texture is lightweight, never greasy. I've noticed my fine lines looking softer, and my skin feels plump and nourished. Definitely one of the best anti-aging moisturizers I've tried! Gifted by Elemis * This is the second time I buy it . I really like it and the price is very reasonable. I like how it feels on my fat. * Elemis graciously gifted me this product. I love Elemis and have loved everything that I have received from them. One of my favorite face cream but with spf in it ‚Ä¶yes please!!Get as much spf out of your products that you can. Definitely recommend!!! * Big fan of the Pro Collagen Moisturizer, so when I saw this SPF ran to get it. Very similar formula, very hydrating and fast absorbing, which is a must on tropical weather. The only thing I don't love is the packaging; a pump or a tube would be best, as that way is easier to apply without touching the rest of the formula. Gifted by elemis * Expensive but worth it! It absorbs beautifully and doesn't have a greasy feeling. I have normal, acne prone skin so I use retinol at night. The SPF is a perfect bonus to protect and hydrate my skin at the same time. Light and pleasant sent! Gifted by elemis for my honest opinion. * This product was gifted by Elemis but it has truly been really great to use. I use this in the daytime and I've been using it for over a week now and really have been enjoying it. It doesn't irritate my skin and gives a nice glow. * Im 56 year old and have dry sensitive skin.
I really love this moisturizer it doesn't break me and it leaves my skin feeling really good. I always struggle finding a SPF that doesn't break me out and this one didn't. 
It has no smell and it isn't sticky either.  And best best part it has SPF 30!

Will buy again but wait for a sale * i usually use Olay products, which I can just buy at the drugstore. But I get some haircare products from Ulta, so thought I'd see what comparable moisturizer-sunscreen they had and give it a try. I know Clinique is a good brand, but for the money, i think I'll stick w/ my much cheaper Olay product. the Clinique product just doesn't absorb into my skin as well as Olay, so i feel as if it's not doing its job as well. * Just got this today, it burns so there's that and I've never had sensitive skin. And it's rolling off in little white rubbery balls all over my face and neck and even in my hair. Yuck! Would love to return but they probably wouldn't let me since I've opened and used but wow, what a disappointment! * It is creamy and glides on easily * I have fair skin and love the option of having sunscreen in my moisturizer so I do not have to apply separately.  Love the clinical repair line from Clinique * I liked the previous Clinique Smart SPF 15 Custom-Repair Moisturizer with shea butter.  Clinique's new Smart Clinical Repair SPF 30 strips away all the moisture in my skin and makes it feel very dry so I'm returning.

I love it and it helps keep my face fresh and glowing. * I have been buying this product for 2 years. I absolutely love it! I can feel a huge difference in my skin when I forget to use it in the morning. My skin is much softer, not dry, clear, no complaints at all. * On my 5th tub! Have tried many other brands, but nothing compares to this hydrating, light weight formula. * While I tried the other moisture surge without aloe, I didnt have any reaction but a week after using this specific one, I started to have red, raw and itchy, dry flaky and scaly patches on my skin. Now about $200 and a dermatologist later, I found out this product gave me eczema on my eyes, cheek and jawline. I don't have a history of eczema in my family or myself and don't have sensitive skin so this reaction was a tough one. Not saying it won't work for everyone, judging by the reviews many people have success with it because everyones skin is different but just be super aware of your skin as it can take awhile for a rash to show up."

Despite that i kept it on underneath my makeup and it was an issue the entire day. * I love the original formulation if the E.L.F holy hydration. But, with summer I thought heck yea moisturizer and SPF combined! I like this product but I don't love it. The consistency is thicker than the original. I also felt it took significantly more time for this to blend in and absorb. I do plan to use this for the summer, but will for sure go back to the original once I've completed this bottle. * So I love that this has SPF, big plus. I was looking for a hydration moisturizer however this is a bit thick. I should have known since they called it Face Cream. I don't mind it as a Night cream. It's just too heavy for day wear."

I have gone through 4 jars so far and will forever repurchase. * I loved it so much * Love this stuff * I seem to have an unpopular opinion about this one. I have pretty balanced skin and I take good care of it. I don't use a million products but the ones i do use are nice products. Im not sure what it is about this moisturizer but it does not soak into my skin. I don't use a ton underneath it either. But it sits on top and doesn't soak in, even with only using a teeny amount. The texture is nice out of the jar and its not overly scented which i like. I just wish it absorbed and I didn't feel like i have a film ln my face when i use it. I, unfortunately, will be returning. * I literally dip ONE finger lightly and thats enough for my whole face! A little goes a very long way! Its super rich but once it warms up on your skin it becomes thin and light like a gel moisturizer. Id say good for all skin types. Its not scented and doesnt break me out! * This moisturizer has long lasting moisturize. It most definitely does soothe, nourish, and plump skin ‚ù§Ô∏è absolutely repurchases."

Bought it for my boys. * Works wonders and helped with my bacne * My dermatologist recommended CeraVe SA for my psoriasis flare ups and it's been very helpful.  I prefer it to using steroids or other topical prescriptions whenever possible.

So far this product has left me pleasantly surprised, it didnt leave me a greasy mess at the end of my work day. I will add that I hydrate and moisturize well before applying this to keep my skin balanced. I think that others who say they are left greasy probably have dehydrated skin. Making sure you not only moisturize your skin but hydrate it as well! * This did nothing for pores or oiliness.  Wish I could still return it. * Does not mattify or control oily skin.  Just terrible! * I beg you Murad, never get rid of this product. It has changed my skin so much. I used to fight my oily skin constantly. With this I feel like I have normal skin I don't have to worry about mid-day.   I stop myself from overstocking because I'm scared it'll stop being made. If you have oily skin I implore you to give this a try. * This is fine on its own for a workout, but it pills horribly if you put any makeup on top. No oil control. Very thick formula that does'nt spread easily, so you'll go through the tube very quickly. * I have oily, sensitive skin so it is very difficult for me to find a daily sunscreen.

It absorbs very well, and will definitely give off wet greasy  vibes which is why i use it at night for the perfect moisturized morrning skin. A little goes a longgg way. You will be glowing! Try it out :) * I have extremely dry, sensitive skin and along with other Ordinary products I have seen a remarkable improvement in my skin texture and health. If I could recommend another product that pairs extremely well with this, and I have seen immediate improvements from, it would be the pink skin barrier serum. I use two pea sizes of this, after the serum, and it covers my face, neck, and d√©colletage. * First I purchased the gel moisturizer, and it made my face sticky.  I purchased this moisturizer hoping it would absorb better with it being a cream.  I was wrong.  Up to an hour later, and it's still not absorbed enough to put powder foundation on.  Not impressed. * Using for more than a year now.

I went to a doctor after having the same reaction to various skin care products and was told to slowly introduce products into my akincare regimen. 
now shiseido is the only brand i use for my nighttime routine. * My skin is perfect. Both times I've tried this it made me break out in tiny pimples all over my face, wherever it touched. They take a full week to go away. I've had the occasional product break me out before, but I've never seen anything like this. * Im on day 2 of using this product ‚Ä¶ i have been trial and error in trying to find a face and eye cream that actually works for me. I feel like my skin feels and looks more hydrated already . It definitely helped smooth my forehead lines. Im 27 and have been struggling with the appearance of genetic facial expression wrinkles :( hopefully ive found my holy grail !! * I will not be buying this cream again or recommending it.

Overall, I don't hate it, but it really did nothing for my skin. * I love it! I have a combination skin. My t zone always gets oily with white heads.

Smells nice and feels great when you put it on but the pilling is awful. * I love the Biolumin C serum but this moisturizer pills when you put makeup over it. Disappointing. * I am a big Dermalogica fan, however, this product was a disappointment.  I cannot use it for daytime under my makeup as it causes a ""pilling"" effect as I apply my foundation.  I use it only at night before bedtime.

I was trying another product at the time and stopped using this for a few days to determine which was helping and i very quickly found out it was this one. I've never looked back.

Before I felt like it had no scent and now it has a chemical kind of scent. It's still moisturizing and I enjoy using it so one star off for the scent. But that's clean beauty for you. * Leaves my skin smooth and hydrated. I use it with the TBT Serum. I have just been using Dime since December and I truly love it and see a huge difference in the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles. I have found this to be very effective and no irritation or discomfort. * I recently purchased Dime DBT Cream, but I'm quite disappointed with the changes in its ingredients. After comparing the product's box and the website, it's clear that the ingredients listed are significantly different. One notable change is that Bakuchiol, which used to be a key ingredient, is now listed near the bottom of the ingredients list. Meanwhile, VP Copolymer, which was previously much lower, is now near the top. This shift raises concerns about the formulation and effectiveness of the product. I'm a little frustrated that the ingredients have changed without clear communication or transparency. If you're someone who trusted the original formulation, be cautious and do your research before purch * Was looking for an alternative to retinol during my pregnancy, and found this. I use this with the TBT oil and my skin has been doing so well. My breakouts have cleared, and my skin overall just feels great. Hoping that this will help with spot corrections due to pregnancy.

Thank you to the sales rep. that demonstrated and recommended. * Got this because I was noticing my skin loosing elaasticity and had 11 lines (29yr). It caused redness on my cheeks. Product was way too heavy. I have combindation type skin. This product might be better for 50+ * I usually don't mind fragrance in cosmetics and skincare products but the fragrance in this is so strong it will irritate your eyes if it gets near your eye area which is not ideal for when you do not have time/money to apply an eye cream separately. It's not a nasty fragrance but it is very irritating to the eyes, but if you happen to get it near the corners of your mouth it will gross you out... it's inconvenient because other facial moisturizers for the same price aren't this much of a hassle. I like Clarins but they need to tone down the fragrance in their facial products. * Excellent product u can see the results immediately * My face is sensitive and oily to normal. This one moisturizer does it all for me. I'm scared to change. * This is an amazing day moisturizer that adds glow, is lightweight but has a luxurious, thick feel to it, smells heavenly (but very light). Filled with natural extracts and antioxidants, it has made a day for my combo skin in late 30s. My skin looks renewed: plump and radiant. Overall, this is better than many other more expensive options and even produces better anti-aging effects on my skin, compared to Clarins' own anti-aging line. I have purchased 3rd jar, and will probably stick with it moving forward as it is very good for my sensitive skin and doesn't clog pores, irritate, or dry it. Love it!!! * I am 55 with very dry skin. I tried this with the other Clarin's serums and even topped it with a vitamin C oil. I dont think it will work for winter. And, I dont see it working for a nightine cream during the winter. It would be a nice moisturizer for summer I believe if you have dry skin.

Not only does it work and protect my skin from the sun, it leaves a slight dewy look all day but not oily! I use it over my moisturizer and them add a little blush and its a perfect no makeup look. Love this ans price is so reasonable. I have sensitive skin and do not breakout with this. * The way this product has a chokehold on me! I slather myself in SPF from head to toe every morning and before any outdoor activities, but could never find a suncreen that didnt get all over my clothes or smell like sunscreen. This product is perfect! It absorbs SO WELL that I put it on before getting dressed and it doesnt rub onto my clothes. It also has a very light and fresh scent that is actually enjoyable. I purchase this in every size so I always have one on me, but the pump is great for the bathroom counter! * Skin irritation occured after using this product. I didn't even want to give it one star! It has some sort of scent, citrus maybe in the product, but doesn't specify that anywhere om the packaging. Wouldn't recommend this product to anyone! * I love this sunscreen and love that it comes in this big jug. I don't understand why all other brands only have small sizes when we are suppose to use a good amt daily. I love that there is nonwhite cast. It blends into my skin and although it's pricey I do t have to buy sunscreen every other week now. * Not fungal acne safe 
Smaller than expected 
No white cast * The best body sunscreen I've ever used. I have very pale skin and burn easily. I applied and reapplied this sunscreen before being at the beach for hours and didnt burn at all. * I'm new to sunscreens and have been on the hunt for one that has PA++++ without a white caste that does not sting my eyes, and this one is it! Also smells great as well. A little expensive, but worth it."

I tried this on a whim. I've just looking up products and their ingredients and I will never use another moisturizer again, this even beats the elf fragrance free holy hydration for me!! * My skin went bonkers when I moved from the desert to the PNW. You'd think going from dry to humid / hot & sunny to cool & cloudy would have been a welcome change but my skin just kept getting red, dry and inflamed. So I tried this. And my face immediately felt better and, over a week completely calmed down. That was over two years ago and I'm still buying it. That said, the price is ridiculous for the size. * Ive been looking for a moisturizer that doesnt make my face or itchy and this is it!

I started using this on a recommendation, not really expecting it to work.  Thankfully, it works so well that I recommend this product on the regular.

Not a moisturizer. * i do like this moisturizer, but the results aren't enough for me to repurchase for myself. if you have dry skin, i don't think this is for us. i have normal-dry skin in the spring & summer, dry-very dry skin in fall & winter. this just didn't give me the amount of moisture i needed, but it did leave my skin feeling soft.

it's a nice beginner skincare product that i would recommend for the hotter seasons. no complaints other than it just wasn't deep enough for me moisture wise. * It goes on feeling nice but, I am still getting dry patches as the day wears on. * hydrating for combination skin. 
I'm using this as a night lotion. works good * I love this stuff and have purchased it 3 times. It lasts, didn't clog my pores and i have oily, acne prone, and sensitive skin. Its not to light or to heavy in texture. Has always felt soothing even after popping irritated acne and did not burn when applied on top of the broken skin. It also gives a healthy glow after i apply it, and leaves skin feeling extremely soft. I also use it with there azeliac acid serum which i 10000% recomend and both products are 100% clean.

However, it is SO drying. I put this on and then 10 minutes later my face is uncomfortably dry for the rest of the day. I can't use this on its own and need to layer another moisturizer on top of it. * This product feels like Iam putting a slimy hair product on my face.  Nice feel after but you really have to wash your hands. I tried rubbing into my hands but had a ick feel. * A great product at a great price. * Been looking for a good moisturizer for my combo skin.

As someone with combination skin type, this is a great product because it does not make me too oily or too dry. * I noughg this gel moisturizer instead if the cream by accident- tried to give it a shot. Dont like it! * My skin is super dry and whenever I put this on I swear it makes my face more dry. I wanted something lightweight for the summer but I guess this isnt it for me. * I've used the leading brands gel moisturizer for years. absolutely love it as I have acne prone skin. instead of my usual re-purchase, I decided to give this product a try. firstly, the consistency. it doesn't pick up easily and literally feels like jello. immediately after application, I didn't feel hydrated at all. within a few days of use, I had DRY SKIN for the first time all over my face! definitely returning. * I recently bought this after it had been on my list for a while. I'm a dermatological girly, but I needed something more affordable in the interim for daily use. So far, I like it ‚Äî it absorbs quickly. I have oily skin, and it leaves my skin with a glow without feeling or looking greasy. I'll be using this throughout the summer. I can definitely tell the difference between this and a high-end product, but it gets the job done for now. * I have oily skin and this product made me feel so dry and dehydrated.

Can't recommend this enough * Its a great moisturizer that spreads evenly and blends in well, leaving a great glow on the face. BUT once makeup goes over top, it pills soooo badly. I've trued changing foundations and skin prep and it is the same result every time. * This SPF is one of my favs and I always get compliments on my skin being glowy when I wear it! 10/10 recommend. Didn't break me out either! * Not that I had irritation after this, but for my skin gel moisturizers work better, this one was heavy on the cream. I don't remember what my skincare was like back when I used this moisturizer at the end of my routine, but I just felt like it was taking forever to rub in and not really moisturizing my face. Personally felt more like a lotion than a gel cream. If this one doesn't work for you either I'd suggest Byoma's other product, the pink gel moisturizer is what I kept using after this one. * I wanted to like this. Seemed good cause its a light gel moisturizer and goes on nice.  Liked that it has spf. But once it drys on your face it pills so bad. Just makes a mess especially of your layering makeup on too. Definitely would not recommend. * I wanted to love this but it pills sooooo bad!! * I have tried so many different brands of sunscreen. I have very senstive, acne prone, oily skin.

I will never stop using it. * This is a great product * Usually a bit out of my budget range for skin care. However, this product is well worth the investment. It has left my skin feeling absolutely amazing! Obsessed with this product. * I have not worn any Lancome products besides their glosses but tried this when I was inside of Ulta then walked around the store. Omg! What a difference. The redness in my cheeks and by the corners of my nose went away. And my skin looked immediately brighter. The feel of the creme itself is SO luxurious and you only need a little bit so it will last a longer time (of course we want that with this price lol) * I love this product and ordered it online for a mother's day gift. However, I somehow got a refill, so it came in a plastic container with a tear-away foil cover and no jar. I didn't even know refills existed for this. I didn't have a container to place it in (other than using a cheap Ziploc bag), so it would have dried out. Hence, I had to return it. I'm not sure if others have had this issue, but Ulta, please be aware! * Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo my mom is a dermatologist and she loves it!!!!!!!! * I have been using this cream for about a month and a half. It feels pleasant and smells beautiful, but does not live up to its claims in my experience. My face does not feel fully hydrated by the end of the day, never mind 24 hours. I have not witnessed brightening or firming. A big selling point (and likely excuse for the huge price tag) is the Grand Rose extract, which Lanc√¥me does a poor job explaining the benefit of. Luckily I had Ulta points to use on this cream, and not my own money. I got roped into the illusion of grandeur and prestige with this Absolue cream. Don't be like me. Much more effective and affordable creams are available on the market. Research ingredients; rose extract offers unremarkable and lackluster benefits. Perhaps the Pro-Xylane and shea butter can, but certainly not in this formulation."

As an added bonus it smells great, like tropical fruit, guava and mango. * Honestly, the main reason I bought this mini cream was the scent. I didn't even care if it did anything else. I figured it was good because of the price and I did see a lot of positive reviews. Some people say the scent was different before, but I cannot vouch for that as I am a first time buyer. It has a very light, natural peachy smell. I usually don't like fake peach smell, but this was just right. It is a rich, moisturizing cream and in the morning my skin feels rested and nourished. This is the last thing I put on at night and it sure feels like a treat. I highly recommend it. * This cream goes on smooth, non greasy and soaks in quickly, however, the scent is very strong and over powering. If it wasnt for the strong scent, I would really like it. * I tried a sample and I was hooked. This is an amazingly luxurious night cream. It is thick in texture and lightly fragranced with the scent of freshness. I am always impressed with how moisturizing it is. It feels so soft on my skin and I am happy to have found it. * Loved this night cream...very, very rich! * LOVE LOVE LOVE! Gives deep hydration and the smell is gorgeous! So nice! Obsessed!!! * Took me a few times to realize a tiny bit goes a long way but the scent is soooo nice!

I'm on my 4th bottle I like it that much!! * Recieved a sample and used on my seriously purging skin. It never irritating my sensitive skin and actually felt soothing. It took hours to ansorb into my skin and left a slightly greasy feel. I awoke this morning to very happy skin - hydrated, smooth, plump and slightly firmer. Once my current moisturizer is empty, I'll be purchasing. * This is my second time repurchasing. I hate the price but this has made a significant difference in my skin. I have sensitive dry skin and this has given my skin the moisture it needs and an amazing glow. I see others are complaining about it being ""greasy"" i havent had that issue. I apply two pumps to my skin and it gives me the most beautiful glow. I use everything Dermalogica and constantly get compliments on my skin. * This is one of those products that's been life changing in my routine. The way my under eyes look & feels from this product is phenomenal. This has helped with my fine lines and wrinkles. Helped firm my under eyes. Super rich lux formula. A little goes a long way. It awakens my under eyes. * I need moisture, not grease.  So sad. I will be going back to my Drunk Elephant."

This is light enough for hot & good enough for cold - just re-apply on any drier spots. Noticed my occasional bad breakouts are gone since using this too. * I have sensitive, more oily than combination skin at certain times of the year. I tried a few moisturizers to see which one works best. And, this is far the best one. Its lightweight, not oily and controls my face from becoming oily. * I have been looking for a gel like moisturizer without a funny smell. This is it! * Like the title suggests. It caused breakouts all over my face. Will probably work best for someone with comination and oily. I have normal skin and felt like my face was tight and dry after using. * i wanted this to work out so much! 
i tried it out for a few days and realized it was causing my face to break out into tiny little red pimples. especially on my forehead and the bridge of my nose. i NEVER get break outs there! i immediately stopped after i realized it was this moisturizer. * I have combination skin so sometimes I'm more dry or oily and this is perfect for days when I'm more oily or I want something lightweight under makeup but definitely I'd say if you're dry don't buy it * I have tried a lot of moisturizers (severe acne for 15 years so Ive tried a lot of products) but with my skin type they tend to feel heavy on the skin or they are almost drying. The way my skin felt after one use of this was life changing. I've experienced no breakouts from this product, it really soaks into my skin, and it out preforms products I've used that are 3x the price. I immediately got my brother on this (he also experiences quite a bit of acne) and he said his skin has never felt better. If you're oily, please give this a try."

This product did NOT add any hydration to my skin & it actually emphasized the the 11's I was trying to plump up.

Definitely worth the money! * I have a strong appreciation for this cream, having used it for the past five years, and I intend to keep using it. It does not cause any irritation and is suitable for use in any weather conditions. Its texture is quite pleasant, and I would definitely recommend it to others. * This moisturizer did not absorb in to my skin and after a couple hours my skin felt dry and tight. It left a layer of cream just sitting on top of my skin. For the price, my skin should be at the very least moisturized * Fragrance is not good for the face, especially for skin of color. Fragrance is one of the leading causes of contact dermititis. It is otherwise a grear profuct, they just need to refomulate & remove the fragrance! * This is my first time using an Ester Lauder product and I'm really impressed. I never write reviews but honestly the improvement in my skin's uneven tone/hyperpigmentation and fine lines- especially on my neck, have  improved considerably.  I've been using for about 3 weeks now. It is a bit pricey but a little goes a long way with this moisturizer. Finally a product that lives up to what it claims to do!"

I put this on 2 hours ago and i can now literally rub my old, dead skin off - which leaves me looking amazing, the next day. The way to fix this? I only use it once a day, at night. Viola‚Ä¶.
I will be purchasing this again. * Got this during the BOGO mini sale. Very thick and heavy, which is what I wanted to try as a nighttime moisturiser, but it's so thick and doesn't spread well and just kind of ended up sitting on top of my skin without actually moisturising it. * I didn't like this cream. * I used it for awhile and it did not work I saw no difference in my skin. * I have sensitive skin so I was hesitant to try this. Im glad I did, I love it ! A little goes a long way, dont use a lot it'll be too heavy. I use a small amount, rub it between my fingers and smooth it on my face.

It hydrates well and is readily available. However, it can feel heavy, has a noticeable fragrance, and doesn't produce dramatic anti-aging results. Best for normal to dry skin, it's a good option if you prioritize affordability and sun protection.  If you have oily or sensitive skin, or dislike fragrance, consider other options. * L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Face and Neck Moisturizer SPF 30 with Pro-Retinol, Vitamin C & Hyaluronic acid is perfectly packaged. With its thick moisturizing consistency I'd say it's a little thicker than anticipated and took some getting used to. Also, I'm an extremely sensitive skinned person that breaks out easily with some scents & comedogenic products. After several weeks of usage I did feel it smoothed my neck, however I did experience some breakouts on my face. I would probably use this product as more of a summertime SPF than a daily moisturizing cream. * 'LOreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer, Pro Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin C to Reduce Wrinkles, Firm & Brighten Skin really does what it claims and MORE! I use this in the morning after I wash my face, but before applying my foundation for the day. It's an integral part of my routine to also use this in the evening after I remove my makekup for the day, but before bed. This leaves my skin hydrated yet moisturized, but also acts as a solid base for my foundation making it not only stretch farther but also moisturizing my skin and helping with fine lines and wrinkles that come with aging. I LOVE the versatility of this product and its light scent. This is one of my most favorite staples and I highly recommend L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer, Pro Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin C to Reduce Wrinkles, Firm & Brighten Skin. Give it a try, I think you'll love it. * Don't be fooled by the little jar, this cream packs a lot of punch. One of the best things about it, is that it pulls double duty as a day cream with the SPF and night cream. Using it at night gives the skin that little bit of extra moisture needed for night time. I can definitely see a difference in my skin after using this for almost a month.  I was given this product in exchange for an honest review * Such a perfect day cream! I received this product about a month ago and have been consistently using it day and night. Even in the winter, I can go all day and night with my skin not only feeling baby smooth soft, and not greasy or shiny. When putting it on, I was struck by the thickness of the cream, yet it slides on easily and just melts into the skin. I am so happy it has spf 30, so I feel confident using it during the daytime. It doesn't roll on the skin, and also does not make my makeup slip off. I could barely smell a scent, and it just lifts up the face and gives it a nice, subtle glow. I also noticed a marked improvement in the texture on my neck. Love it!! * I received This free in exchange for my honest review. This one now replace my much more expensive lotion. It has wonderful ingredients and left my skin feeling so smooth. Blurred my lines and pores. I love the scent of this. I will definitely be repurchasing this. Works much better than the more expensive brand."

I now have a newfound respect for Oatmeal as an active ingredient. * I have been using this for years but since they changed the formula I developed a rash around my eyes and rashes on my face.

My skin had some sensitivity issues a couple weeks after I started using the product - redness, small blisters and peeling. It might've been this product, might not, but i still have not recovered. Waited too long to return it and so I started using on my neck and chest without issues. I wear a lot of V-neck tops, and noticed my freckles and dark spots faded surprisingly quickly!

My skin looks so glowing and fresh, but never greasy and works great as a primer for make up truly a glass of water for my skin. * I just finished my first jar of the water cream hyaluronic glow moisturizer and I will be going back to Ulta to grab another one today. It is nice and light, great for daytime or nighttime wear. It absorbs so nicely and my skin feels super hydrated! * I've been trying to replace my Tatcha water cream bc its so expensive. This one, although not a dupe, is a good replacement. It leaves my skin soft, glowy, & hydrated. Be careful if you have oily skin‚Ä¶ you only need the tiniest dime-sized amount‚Ä¶ the jar could last you forever. If you use too much it could become oily and heavy. * Anything philosophy I love, so when I saw this it was a must try. It is AMAZING. Makes my skin feel amazing, the scent is amazing, I will be buying again! * Hope in a jar is a great product. Never used it for years. It's unfortunate that the price has sky rocketed * I love this moisturizer, but not the price lol. I managed to snag it during the 21 Days of Beauty and since I had a gift card I got it for cheap. It leaves my face feeling hydrated, but not sticky or heavy."
147,dime,dewy day cream: rosehip + tremella,pimprod2039423,2612541," * The cream wouldn't soak into my skin. It's very thick and waxy feeling. Perhaps I got an old product because it felt terrible on my skin like it would clog pores and it had a funky scent. * I have dry and dehydrated skin. The cream doesn't easily absorb into the skin at all, and it sits on the face hot and heavy. Really struggling to finish it. My husband is usually not picky, but he too doesn't like it at all. * I use the full Dime skincare line, and it's the best I've ever used. I'm 58 and needed a change about a year ago as I started to see changes in my skin. I also wanted to start using a clean product line. I found Dime, and it's been amazing. The Dewy Day cream is in fact dewy! I often start applying this and hear myself say outloud, ""Ahhhh."" It just feels so good going on and does it's job well. Perfect for daytime and under makeup. * I dislike fragrances and for some reason, it is difficult to find skincare without it.
This brand is my new go-to.  It is light, dewy, and does what i need it to do.  I also love the price. * I've used this moisturizer a few times. So far I'm liking it, it goes on smoothly and doesn't feel sticky. * I love the sleek, black packaging. However, I do not understand all the good reviews.  I have extremely oily skin, and this ""dewy"" cream made my skin very dry and tight every time I used it. I very much prefer the dewy skin cream from Tatcha. * Im almost done with it and can say that im disappointed it was not hydrating. I put a good amount too to make sure and nothing. I really liked the toner so i wanted to try the day cream but i honestly didnt like it. For the price you could spend the same or spend a little more and get a better product"

I had to stop using it. * I really did not like this (dry) serum.  I don't like the texture at all.  It feels gritty and things tend to pill on it.  Since I want to use it under makeup, that is a problem.  I think the science behind it is good, otherwise it would have been one star only. * I received a sample of this. I am in need of products  to help with dark circles and bags. I don't like the texture, which is course like sandpaper. I've begun taking Vitamin C pills. Maybe that will help. * I love it. It's so much moisturizing. * So, I've been using this for over 3 years off and on!! You MUST start slow.. I tolerate tretinion 1%and use a lot of glycolic acids, but this took some time, now im able to use even on eyelids.. works incredibly, brightens, helps a lot with crows feet and eyelids!!! Great product!! * Would definitely recommend this to everyone! It does everything they claim it does. 10/10 you won't regret it. * I've done a lot of research on this brand and the reviews seem to outshine other brands.  I'm so excited to try it.  I have a friend who is in love with all their products already!"
149,av√É¬®ne,hydrance aqua gel,pimprod2020807,2577168," * This lightweight moisturizer was good enough but the smell/fragrance is SO strong. It's surprising for an Avene product. I will not repurchase. * I love MOISTURE! I wish I could put this all over my body. I little goes a long way and  it completely covers my face with delightfuly dewy hydration. * This product is HEAVILY scented snd burned my sensitive skin. Its a no for me. * This moisturizer does hydrate but there's some pretty big cons. 
-Not for oily skin. Leaves the skin very oily a few hours after application.
- Not non comedogenic. Caused a lot of new breakouts.
- Fragrance is strong * I got this in a travel size in a gift set and was excited to use it on a long weekend trip. As soon as I opened the packaging, I was hit with the aggressive smell of this product and was transported back to my grandmother applying her heavily scented products in my youth. Since I had no other moisturizer with me, I used it and my combo acne prone skin informed me that I had offended it with the noxiously scented product. My skin was irritated and my husband, who has the worst sense of smell ever, could smell this product through a couple layers of product.

So needless to say, I do not recommend this product. * I had a bad experience with this cream. I have used this brand for many years because its products are made with high-quality ingredients, and it always tries to take care of the skin. But this cream, besides having a horrible and extremely strong smell, filled my face with pimples, made me look like a teenager, and dried out some areas of my face. It was a total disappointment. * loved the way it made my skin feel
but can't get past the strong fragrance"

151,av√É¬®ne,retrinal 0.05 cream,pimprod2042754,2618818," * I received this product in exchange for my honest review. It gently smooths the appearance of wrinkles and gives my skin a firmer look without causing any irritation or discomfort. The formula feels high quality. My complexion looks brighter, more even, and plumper. I love that it's fragrance free. I apply it each evening to my face, neck, and decollete. * This ends up changing color to dark pink and then I have to throw it out.  What a waste of money * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This product is light and goes on very nicely. I've been also using on my elbows and chest to get some added benefits. Would definitely recommend this brand! * I used the cream for a month every night before going to bed. I used retinol before. This cream is very light in texture and absorbs instantly, the feeling of comfort of the skin is magical. I see that the skin began to look healthier and brighter, radiant and soft after using the cream. The wrinkle area on the neck and face became less pronounced than it was before using the cream. o received this product in exchange for my honest review. * I really like this Avene face cream. I haven't heard of ""retrinal"" before trying this, I have read that it is a form of retinoic acid, so a form of retinol, I presume.  I have been using this a while & have noticed my skin feels smoother & a bit more firm. I haven't experienced any redness or excessive dryness (what little I have, I believe, is from the cold weather & easily came away with my weekly physical exfoliating.)  I would recommend it, very nice face cream for young 30s skin. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This cream initially felt like a great moisturizer and seemed to absorb somewhat ok when I applied it prior to going to sleep. When I woke in the morning though it felt like it had left behind a residue or film on my skin and I had to wash it off. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I've been using Aveeno RetrinAL 0.5 for a few weeks now, and I'm genuinely impressed with how gentle yet effective it is. As someone with sensitive, combination skin that's prone to occasional breakouts, I was cautious about trying a retinoid, but this one has been a great introduction.

The texture is lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy residue. I didn't experience any major irritation, flaking, or dryness‚Äîjust a little initial tightness that went away after a few uses. I've noticed a subtle improvement in my skin tone and texture; my pores look more refined, and my skin feels smoother and more even.

I also appreciate that it's fragrance-free and formulated with nourishing ingredients like vitamin E and thermal spring water, which help balance out the potency of the retinoid. It layers well with my other skincare products, including moisturizers and sunscreen.

Overall, Aveeno RetrinAL 0.5 is a solid, beginner-friendly option for anyone looking to incorporate retinal (a gentler but effective retinoid) into their routine without the harsh side effects. I'm looking forward to continued results with long-term use."

But I don't like the that is make my face oily and my make-up does not last. * this used to be my favorite moisturizer of all time. it was thick, glowy and completely smoothed the texture of my skin like no other. i restocked in march 2025 after not purchasing since 2024 and the product i received can only be summarized as garbage. it smells different, its a much lighter consistency (which i want to note is a BAD thing in this case) and the glow on this lasts about only 10 minutes before seeping in and my skin goes back to dull. i have super (SUPER) dry skin and this product used to be the only moisturizer that actually worked. i'm sad to say that what they're selling now is not the same moisturizer it used to be. if you're reading this in 2025 hoping you've found your new favorite moisturizer, KEEP LOOKING. THE NEW FORMULA OF THIS IS NOT IT! * I'm new to the Supergoop product line and  I really needed this Superscreen to work for me. And voila! It did! I have sensitive skin, both oily and dry if that makes sense. This product goes on smoothly, blends in vs. typical sunscreens that never seem to soak into the skin. I will say I noticed a pretty strong scent of sunscreen when I first opened it. Now, just a few days later, I don't notice it at all. I love how this makes my skin feel hydrated but not oily. And it lasts all day. I apply once in the morning after washing my face and same routine at night. * I'm new to the Supergoop product line and  I really needed this Superscreen to work for me.

My face started stinging and itching after the second use and it doesnt go on as smooth. * i loved this product for so long, but didnt realize that it what was breaking me out. i tried a different cleanser, added an exfoliater etc. NOTHING would get rid of the harsh bumps all over my face. not until i researched and found out it had safflower it in which (can) support fungal acne. i have dry, sensitive acneic skin so this may work for others but definitely not for me. very disappointed and wish i found out sooner. not even 3 days after stopping this product, my skin is clearing up."
155,neutrogena,hydro boost hyaluronic acid water cream - fragrance free,pimprod2041040,2615560," * I really loved it. It's very smooth on the skin, and my skin absorbs it well, keeping my face hydrated and looking healthy. I love that! The only downside is that the bottle is a bit small, so if they offered a larger size, I would definitely consider buying that. Other than that, I absolutely love it, and it's really affordable! * This is a good product for lightweight hydration. I love the gel-cream texture, how it absorbs into the skin, and how it isn't greasy. Most of the time, this was an effective product, however I felt that on very cold days when my skin was incredibly dry, I needed something else as well. I would purchase the full-size, however it is a little expensive. * This made me break out! I'm glad I figured out it's this! Had to throw mine away. * This was a good moisturizer and felt lightweight on the skin. Felt very similar to the Tula Dew Your Thing moisturizer. I never woke up with any breakouts when I used this at night. However, I don't know if this would be suitable for somone with acne as I feel like it does just sit on the skin. * So many people like this product but i dont know why. I put it on and it feels nice at first but then within the hour I'm dry again and its like i didnt put any moisturizer on at all. I tested this out for 2 weeks and my face feels rough, its like this ruined the texture. So weird. * why would u guys change something so good it makes no sense at all, never buying again the new formula is not nearly as good * I love the moisturizer so much i bought the larger size"

I LOVE IT!!! It blends GREAT (especially for a product with SPF), isn't greasy, doesn't make my skin oily or shiny, has not caused a breakout, and I can see a clear difference in the moisture level of my skin in just a few days. Anti-aging creams normally make my skin totally freak out, but this one is all good, no bad. Really glad I happened upon it! * This contains Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene....FYI * I joke that this is my old lady face cream because it smells like a bouquet of roses. However, it really does give the skin a lifted appearance and tightened feel. The daytime version has some SPF and wears nice under makeup. I wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin because of the fragrance. Also, I noticed on very dry winter days the product does not have enough moisture for my skin * I received this as a sample size from Estee Lauder and I can't wait to buy a full size. This is why I love samples, It lets me fiind out what I love without spending a fortune first.  It has the faintest fragrance that is subtle but lovely. It goes on so smooth and is just pleasant to use. My only complaint is the price. Some of us would buy this brand more often if we weren't priced out of the market. This is why I gave it a four. Otherwise, a five all the way. * This smells like febreeze and it doesn't go away when you rub it in :( save your monies * I use this product daily.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. It did not irritate my skin, which can sometimes be an issue for me.  Makeup base glides on smoothly over this moisturizer.  It is my absolute favorite. * I wish I could use this product as it seems to work well. However the fragrance is too strong and irritating."

I just finished up the container and have seen absolutely no difference in my skin. For this price there must be something better out there! * I use this morning and night along with the face and eye serum (same brand) followed by sunscreen (only in the morning). I can truly say that this stuff along with the face and eye serum works. I used to have very dry skin, but not anymore. Also, the hormonal acne I get occasionally is under control. Lastly, the wrinkles are diminishing. Totally worth every penny. * I see smoother skin , brighter skin , less fine lines and an overall younger look * I do love this product, it's true to all things advertised - A little bit goes a long way as I purchased this a few months ago and still have more than half of it left. I did not want to write a review until I was certain I was satisfied based off of the huge expense... 

that said, I wish the product was a bit less expensive because I have tried other product lines that do the same job without the extra $$... but then again, you are paying for the name"

Giving 3 stars though because it is very moisturizing, just be aware if you deal with comedone related issues ! * I was expecting a rich cream so I was disappointed to find the cream is rather thin. It looks and feels a lot like wall paint. I find the scent unpleasant although it doesn't linger on the skin so its a temporary annoyance. It feels like applying paint to my skin but it does rub in well. It sets down to a non-shiny finish. It is good for daytime under make up or at night before bed. I find it moderately hydrating, but my skin is pretty dry. This just isn't enough for me. I wouldn't repurchase....I just can't get past the texture and scent. * Love this moisturizer so much! I use it at  night over my Tretnoin and it leaves my skin plump and hydrated. I also love the oaty smell it has. * My skin is dry, aging, sensitive, and is prone to rosacea and eczema. Previously, I was using Weleda Sensitive line, but it was discontinued. It was just ok--no real positive changes to my skin. I've been using this product along with a serum from the same line for about 2 weeks. My skin is calm and moisturized. It's a little soon to tell if there are any positive changes, but I would definitely order this again. * On my 3rd jar snd will always have this in my routine. * I've had severe acne, and after trying all things acne (salicylic acid, benzoyl, azleic acid, lactic, etc) this cream and their barrier serum saved my skin.

It leaves an oily residue no matter how much I rinse my face‚Ä¶ due to the very thick, gel, consistency. * Cerave it's the best. Excellent product and great price * I've tried lots of CeraVe's products and I have to say this was my favorite. I use it in the shower every day and it never fails to cleanse my face perfectly. I would DEFINITELY recommend. * If you like endocrine disruptors, you'll love this stuff. Plenty of parabens to mess up your hormone levels. This stuff is illegal in other countries, and Ulta should not sell it. Guess I have to read every single label. Wildly disappointed. * Unfortunately i was not not impressed. I do have combination skin type. I usually like CeraVe moisturizer but this cleanser didnt clean. Caused little tiny white heads every so often and jist didn't leave me squeaky clean. I also didn't like the texture so I think this cleanser maybe best for dry skin. * I started using this several months ago because of the good reviews and I wanted a gentle cleanser. I did notice a burning feeling if I left it on too long, but ignored it. A short time later I was having really bad perioral dermatitis and tried everything I could think of to stop it (but still using this ""gentle"" cleanser). It wasnt until my daughter started using this cleanser and began getting dermatitis as well that I finally figured out it was this cleanser causing all our problems.

I have sensitive combination skin and I always struggled to find a product that didnt give me that greasy glow. 

This product is light yet hydrating enough that it doesnt require a lot of product. While the price tad is high, the big container last me 2-3 months depending on the weather. 

I would recommend you get a sampler size and try it out for 3 months because you wont see any instant results.

I love the line, its fine quality and i will never waver! * I bought this after many great reviews. I used it around 10 times and thought it was sunburn because I was red and sore. I switched to e45 then another brand and I was fine. I then tried it again after a couple of weeks and it stung my face again! I usually don't have sensitive skin and I'm gutted I spent so much and now can't use it * Every single thing on my face 'balls up' when I use this moisturizer, including when I use it alone.  It does not absorb into my skin, but just sits on top. I've tried it in so many combinations and it's just incompatible with other skin care and foundations (I've tried several foundations -high end & low end- with same results).  I've also tried using it with serums, different primers, different sunscreens and alone with the same result. This is a hard pass for me."

I also apply a ceramide barrier serum beforehand and do not experience any dryness while using this product. Would absolutely purchase a cool toned tinted version of this."

It's light weight, a cool feeling, and goes on the skin well. A little goes a long way. And it's hydrating!! * Great wipes to put in a gift bag for weekend girls trip! * This takes aaaaalllllll the makeup off leaving your face soft and clean. This is truly fragrance free which is extremely important to me. Does not smell at all!!! * Absolutely grab this to remove your makeup! Its great! Works well! It cleans all of the makeup off! * It is very sticky when applied to the skin. There is really no moisturizing to the skin, just  a sticky gel. * Works well to remove greasy base, blush, and foundation."

172,honest beauty,hydrogel cream,pimprod2015205,2566810," * I have used it for a few weeks, it doesn't seem to provide long term moisture. It is nice that it avoids the chemicals I avoid, but I wish it did more good. * I have had this hydrogen cream for awhile and everything I use it, it just feels sticky and greasy. It does not go on the skin smoothly. It leaves a greasy sticky residue on my fingers. Since using it, I have not seen or felt any skin benefits. I have stopped using this and prefer my Elemis collagen spf cream instead. * Only moisturizer that doesn't stuff up my nose. I tried clinique also and couldn't use it. Love their products. * New favorite! Absolutely love how the texture of this moisturizer changes as you rub it in. It melts down almost like water, really feels like your skin took a huge drink of H2O. It does take a while to sink in though, so if dewy finishes aren't your thing I'd pass on it. Best for nighttime use. * Better than the expensive stuff by a landslide. Ive been using this and gifting this to family and friends for many years. Nothing compares. * I have combination skin. This did not break me out. I love how the texture changes once you start to rub it in. However, i wish it absorbed into the skin more completely. My skin feels tacky after using this, so my hair sticks to it. Oversll good tho! * This was recommended by a black dermatologist over a year ago.  I use it in combination with the vit C serum, any Vit C serum will work.  I absolutely LOVE the way this both looks and FEELS on my skin.  It works great with my various varieties of sunscreen, and I've never loved how great my skin looks so much. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
173,la roche-posay,toleriane rosaliac anti-redness face moisturizer for sensitive skin,pimprod2038740,2610275," * I started using La Roche-Posay face wash and moisturizer about 6 months ago, and has been great for my skin. My face is softer, less shiny, and my pores are smaller/less noticeable, but I still have some dry red spots on my cheeks. Even adding extra moisturizer doesn't help. I had high hopes for this product, but it was not a good fit for me. Despite the fact that green is supposed to cancel out red, the green really stood out on cheeks and I had to rub and rub and rub to try and get it to absorb and not be noticeable. Within about 10 minutes, my cheeks felt hot and dry, and I ended up wiping the product off with a cool, damp towel. The texture of the product was nice, and there was no scent, which I appreciated, but it just didn't work for me. * This has definitely calmed my rosacea flare at a fraction of the cost for products at the dermatologist and it fits in perfectly with my skin care routine * This is sold as a moisturizer but it definitely is not one. It goes on more like a primer and it made my freshly washed face look dried out and my pores more noticeable! It does slightly tone down redness but at the expense of making your skin look patchy and dry like you caked makeup on your face without moisturizing first. Definitely did more harm than help so I was really disappointed. * I was excited to try this out but I don't like it. It was hard to blend into the skin. It would sink into my pores and stay there, it almost looks like a white cast from sunscreen. It says to apply to the whole face and neck but I think it's better as a spot treatment. I don't think I'd buy it again * Helps with redness due to dryness but also with my rosacea as well. Super gentle on the skin and great for sensitive skin as well. * I have rosacea 1. When it flares up, my cheeks get very red, irritated, hot, and become super sensitive to topicals. This product makes my cheeks feel itchy and the green tint is super patchy in coverage. Does it his some redness? Sure‚Ä¶but my face looks blotchy. 

I previously tried a sample of the rossliac cream from my dermatologist and it was too thick and this is only slightly better in texture. * I wanted to give this green tinted moisturizer a shot since I have a mild form of rosacea, where my skin turns red from the littlest bit of sun exposure or high tenperatures. After applying, it didn't moisturize at all, the green pigment clung to dry patches on my skin highlighting them, and even though its frangrance free it had an overbearing scent of milk from a jug. Sadly had to return it."
174,tula,protect + plump firming & hydrating face moisturizer,pimprod2019788,2571139," * This is the absolute WORSE skin care product I've ever purchased for my face.  It is extremely over priced and delivers 0.0 of the results it claims to.  It does not plump, protect, or hydrate.  It also doesn't smell great tbh.  I'm convinced it's an artificial product with a fancy label.  Money making scam 100%! * I love the the way my skin looks and feels I can totally tell the difference. My skin is hydrated. * product smells awful!!! * Tried this moisturizer because i love the cleanser, but its the total opposite. Unlike the cleanser which is light, smells great and leaves skin feeling fresh, this moisturizer is thick, feels heavy on your face, and smells like artificial fruit. Also, the pump is terrible. * This moisturizer is absolutely amazing! My face is so soft and hydrated, I couldn't believe it. The smell is light and fruity. I'm so happy I gave it a try. * Though I do love the way this lotion feels on my skin, I won't purchase this again unless the packaging changes. It feels cheap and only works about 2/3 of the time. The scent of the lotion also takes some getting used to. * I like the feel on my skin. It has a lot of moisture in it and my skin looks good when using.  I get a lot of compliments regarding my skin"

It is deeply moisturizing and not light like some other creams. I love it, definitely recommend * This smells wonderful! It has a nice consistency and absorbs quickly without disappearing. It is on my repurchase list. * Have tried various moisturizers different brands and price ranges. This one by far the best one ive tried and the only one to proivde consistent results. * This cream makes my sensitive skin soft and smooth. I usually get dry flaky areas in the winter and I have none with this cream so far! The Hope moisturizer made me break out, but this did not. I will never be without it. * Bought this when it was on sale. Smells like plato but it did help with fine lines and felt moisturizing on my skin! My skins on the dryer side and this one would be good for normal-oily imo. The smell does go away after applying bjt it leaves a  great glow. Id get a lot of compliments going out not long after application * I love this so much its my favorite! makes my skin so soft. * This product brings moisture to my skin & helps decrease lines"
176,coola,refreshing water cream spf 50,pimprod2021554,2575597," * I love everything about the sunscreen except for the wasteful packaging. I feel like I can get a bit more out of it if the packaging was maybe in a tube or something. However, It's glowy, it doesn't leave a white cast on brown skin, it doesn't have a strong fragrance, it's very hydrating. I love that is SPF 50 UVA and UVB with broadrange sun protection I make sure to stock up when it's on sale. Cosmetic chemist approved. * I wanted to love this product, especially since i love the scalp SPF spray they have. But this makes my face feel icky, even being a water based cream. It also leaves a weird lingering smell, cant really explain it. * The consistency is great, a super light watery cream and smells like a faint coconut smell. It feels really greasy after a while and I don't think it really helped with bluelight ? Idk hard to tell, as far as under makeup I did not like, it never sunk in. 
I would use it if it was the only sunscreen available near me but wouldnt re purchase or grab for it on my own. * The consistency is great, a super light watery cream and smells like a faint coconut smell.

I would use it if it was the only sunscreen available near me but wouldnt re purchase or grab for it on my own. * I'm so happy to receive these products from BeautyTap. This was the first time I've used a moisturizer by Coola. I've heard a lot about this brand and have always been curious about this company. Anyways this moisturizer was smooth, comfy, and lightweight on the skin. I love the fact it has sunscreen and it's a 2 in 1 product. This cream isn't too greasy on my skin and is easily absorbed, usually, when I wear sunscreen it is clear so I don't have to deal with a white cast and greasiness. My skin felt refreshed and awake when I used this. I love that it has water-like hydration, anti-pollution, and digital de-stress. These are some of the ingredients that I haven't in any other products before. Plus it is cruelty-free, vegan, and antioxidant-enriched. * I'm absolutely thrilled with this sunscreen, and I love that it's vegan, clean, and cruelty-free. One of the standout features for me is its incredibly lightweight texture, which leaves no white flashback or residue on my skin. It glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly, without any greasy or sticky feeling. Another huge plus is that it's fragrance-free, which is perfect for my sensitive skin. Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with this sunscreen and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality, eco-friendly option.""Product was received as part of an educational promotion."" * I LOVE this stuff! Very high SPF, and it's sanitary because it comes out through a pump at the top rather than needing to stick your fingers in a jar. I have ~normal to slightly dry skin, and I LOVE the moisture and glow it gives, without or with makeup on top. I do wish there was a way to open it at the end to get the remaining product that the pump won't squeeze out though.. otherwise 5/5 fully recommend. I even love the scent as it has a hint of the suncreen smell but not too much."

It looked like a major sunburn. * I have the most sensitive acne prone skin on the planet, and this works perfect for me.  In fact, my acne cleared up a lot after I started using it.  Fades fine lines fantastically.  Not drying, fragrance free, and price is great!  Wear sunblock if you use this.  You will not regret this purchase!!! * This moisturizing cream is light as a feather yet provides lots of hydration. I also love that it is unscented. I haven't been using it long enough to see results such as fewer or less sever wrinkles but I'm hopeful. * This is a great size and works so great. My skin is more youthful and softer. I love the roc brand . This I used for a month and I feel my skin looked more plumper. It stays all day works great under your makeup.No smell also leaves no residue behind. Sinks into your skin very fast. I definitely recommend this. The price is great for this big of bottle. * I received this product as part of a #pinchme free trial and am happy I did. I have combination skin but dry more often than now. Also starting to develop fine lines. This creme not only made my skin feel smooth and hydrated, but also looks more radiant. * While I received a free product from RoC, I definitely am not being compensated for this and wanted to share that I did love the product. The retinol correction max daily feels amazinng on my skin and my skin overall feels softer and more supple after using it for a month. I didn't notice any changes the first 2 weeks but after a full month, I am loving how my skin is feeling. * The texture was good. The smell was not strong, but I like it. The effect was excellent! My skin is dry. I could feel it affected on my skin only one day. I highly recommend it!!!"
178,hero cosmetics,rescue balm +red correct post-blemish recovery cream,pimprod2034649,2599903," * I loved this so much, until it broke me out in hives. DO NOT get this if you have sensitive skin. * Wondering about the rescue balm with red correct formula changes. I have been a avid user of this product and can't rave enough about it. It had become increasingly hard to find in my local stores, so I placed and online order for several tubes(through Ulta). The product I received was not ole faithful, the texture was different(more like a silky primer instead of creamy), and the coverage was much less. The new  tubes, while still showing the same volume was in it, was slightly smaller as I compared to the many older tubes I have around. Is this a formula, change? If so, it makes me sad! The older product was far superior. * I have used this ever day for probably about 4 or so years. I have acne prone skin. The old formula soothed my blemishes while also adding a little bit of coverage and color correcting the redness. The result was a nice moisturized glow. 

This new formula is completely different and I hate it :-(. It does not color correct my redness, and offers no blemish coverage either. It's almost like there is less encapsulated pigments in this formula. To make it worse, this new formula makes my already oily skin SO shiny. I was a die hard fan for so long and now I can't use this product anymore since it does absolutely nothing for my skin. * PLEASE bring back the original formula. I was so disappointed when I got a new tube. I used it and it seemed gritty and the color is basically yellow. It's beyond usable for me. This was my all time favorite product üò© * I loved this product, searched long and hard for redness correcting, found this and fell in love. Just bought the ""new"" formula and will be returning as soon as I can. It's not a new formula, it's a different product and its greasy, doesn't blend. No * I bought a new tube and had no idea they have changed it so drastically. It's now runny, provides zero redness reduction and feels so oily on my skin. It's so drastically different I was shocked. They even slightly changed the wording on the tube but not enough to let buyers know they changed all things that were good about it! 

Wish I could return it but I've already tossed the box. Such a waste and terrible change to such a great product for those with rosacea or redness. Disappointing! * The original formula has been my every day go to for YEARS! I mean I buy multiple at a time to make sure I don't run out. Well, I ran out and this new formula is HORRIBLE. It covers nothing, actually makes me more red! Bring back the old please üò©üò©"
179,cosrx,full fit propolis light cream,pimprod2017573,2568303," * not sticky at all and doesnt pill when layered with other things. great at hydrating while still being light. * I have a very hard time finding moisturizers for my dry sensitive skin. This is dewy and hydrating without breaking me out. My skin is less red and smoother after using this. Love it! * I absolutely love this moisturizer! It's light & feels very hydrating. I love the dewy finish on my skin, but I wouldn't recommend for oily girls. This has Propolis at the very top of the ingredient list, so you know you're getting all the benefits for an affordable price. Not to mention it's fragrance free! I pair this with a peptide eye cream & it has diminished my fine lines * In lieu of my 5 star rating, this product sadly ended up in my ""can't use"" category. I absolutely loved EVERYTHING about the whole Propolis line, but unforturnately Propolis is an allergen tested during an allergy patch test and mine showed a trace reaction which my allergist informed me to avoid any allergens even if it is only a trace. This could be an issue for people who have sensitive skin. I have to say that other than being a possible irritant or allergy to some, this moisturizer is a really great consistency and lives up to all the expectations that it claims to have. As with any product that is new to your skin, proceed with caution and do a patch test. Its worth knowing :) * I love the toner and serum in this line but for whatever reason this lotion is just waaay too much for me. It would irritate my exzema and cause small/minor breakouts. I have dry/reactive/acne prone skin so moisturizers are a challenge for me * My skin loves it! My pores look smooth, its calming & hydrating without looking greasy. A little goes a long way. * I LOVE THIS! My skin took around a week to really settle into this as my face reacts to new things. However once i got into the routine of using this, my pores look smooth, my skin is plump, and is overall hydrating without looking greasy. It also calms down the redness I have on my cheeks. A little goes a long way. I finally found a moisturizer that works for me."

I have a combo skin and its light weight, but the girl HYDRATES! My skin is more balanced now since using this with their cleanser. Love!! * Amazing product that is non greasy and super moist! My favorite by far! Great for all skin but definitely for my mature skin! * This is a great cream with soothing ingredients that don't overwhelm pores because it has a gel like cream feel and safe ingredients. * There's that feeling that you sometimes get when you put on a product where you instantly know it's clogging your pores. like your skin can't breathe. This is one of the worst offenders I've ever used. Immediately washed it off. miserable * It smells Expired/rancid. I checked the Expiration date and it says 10/2025 * And only need a small amount * I stumbled upon this product by chance.

For the past couple of years, my skin had been declining rapidly. In just two days, it had improved so much that I no longer have a single dry patch on my face, chin, or around my nose. There's no redness either. After a full week of using it, my skin looks better than it has in five years. I've tried everything, including every facial and medical-grade product, but this is the only thing that works. I haven't tested it under makeup, and I only use it at night."
181,mac,hyper real skincanvas balm moisturizing cream,pimprod2037107,2605398," * This truly is like butter. It's so soft and gentle to spread on your face. * I love the way this looks and feels. I wish Mac would make a fragrance free version as this irritates my skin. Remove the fragrance and you would have more consumers imo. * I really like this moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. I have dry skin that gets worse in the winter, but by day three, I noticed a significant improvement and felt much less dryness. * I love this moisturizer. I use it daily as my skin prep before makeup. It keeps my skin so hydrated under foundation!! * This is perfect to moisturize the skin before applying makeup. Leaves your skin glowing and hydrated before foundation * This is the key to flawless makeup! I've used countless moisturizers and primers, and have never been quite happy with how my makeup blended on top. I wish I would have tried this sooner, but it was worth the wait. I have combo skin, and this is so smooth and hydrating, but not heavy or greasy. The smoothness is what makes me love how my foundation blends on top. I like a matte finish foundation, but they tend to be too drying and look dry on my skin. Not anymore! I get the smoothest, most plush looking effect from this moisturizer and my makeup looks better than ever! I highly recommend this! * True to explain, stays on, I see the difference in my skin."
182,origins,ginzing energizing gel cream with caffeine + niacinamide,pimprod2033869,2598935," * I used this product for a few good years. Worked well with my oily/sensitive skin and absorbed really well and smells good. After the ingredient change, it just doesn't feel the same. It feels tacky on the skin and can rub off. * After reading reviews realized i wasnt the only one with this problem, it pills / rubs off. I do like everything about this, the texture, scent, way my skin looks after using but unfortunately the pilling aspect of it isnt worth the moisturizer overall so ultimately wouldn't recommend:( * This gel cream is amazing, I love it! Does exactly what it says it does. * I received this as part of a free gift. I wish I could rate it higher because it smells absolutely amazing and has such a nice color and texture. The formula is very sticky and it makes my face burn. This would've been my new go to product. * Love this makes my face feel fresh and awake. My skin feels more firm and adds some brightness. * This stuff is amazing! I have tried everything for the bags under my eyes caused mostly by allergies and I hate yo admit probably lack of sleep. But this stuff really helped unlike the others. I used it with the matching skin cream and my eyes and skin look 100% brighter and my skin is so smooth and has a glow. I feel like i look 20 again lol * Brightens & moisturizes well without being oily. I pair this with Origins ginzing spf 30 and origins gizing refreshing eye cream. I've been using this combo since 2023 through two pregnancies and already acne prone skin. It keeps breakouts at bay while brightening my skin. NO PILLING. :)"
183,peach & lily,rescue party barrier comfort cream,pimprod2042702,2617478," * I needed a deeply moisturizing & gentle nighttime cream. This is absolutely amazing. I wanted something protective and soothing for my sensitive & eczema prone skin. Before I was using vanicream at night but it was too thick, too greasy, and clogged my pores. This moisturizer is some how the perfect viscosity, doesn't leave a layer of grease on me, & doesn't irritate my skin. I only had purging for a few days before my skin adjusted, which is the fastest I've finished purging. Because it's so expensive, I only use at night, but a little goes far. 
Why are the reviews so low?! * The only moisturizer that truly works for my skin. * I cannot get past the smell. It smells like product that went bad, plastic, chemical, and just old and gross. Did P&L quality control miss something? * I dont have very senstive skin but i had a reaction to anothet product that caused my skin to become flaky and very dehydrated. Since this was advertised as something to restore skin barriers and comfort the skin, i busted it out. Boy, it doesn't comfort my skin at all. It makes my skin sting and red, while not being moisturizing. It also has a smell that smells as though it went bad‚Ä¶very plasticky smell that is heavy. I'll be using the rest of the product on my body as it does nothing for my skin and smells horrible. * Let's get the smell out of the way: it actually reminds me of clay masks. But it's not like I can smell it more than 3 minutes after applying, so even if I didn't like it (I don't mind it), it wouldn't matter too much.

More importantly, this stuff has SAVED my skin. I had tried so many creams and yet every time I would put on makeup, the little dry flakey patches on my forehead would be highlighted. After using this only a couple of times I noticed I stopped seeing those patches.

It feels really thick and soothing but it doesn't sit annoyingly on top of my skin. I've used it after IPL and felt not even a ghost of a sting. It helped me heal quickly after spending too long in the sun. Seriously if you have dehydrated skin issues or need a bump of soothing, gentle care this is your cream.

If I had a gripe I guess it would be that I wish it came with more product for the price. But it lasts longer for me because I only use it at night. * I purchased this when looking for a creamy moisturizer to help battle the dry winter air. I do like the texture but it did make me break out. It does smell a tad funky - reminded me of rancid oil similar to expired essential oils or nuts - but it's not too strong to be a deal breaker. I'll use it as a hand cream to finish the jar. * This has transformed my skin for the better. It has significantly helped the texture and my rosacea. The smell just smells like unscented cream and is unoticeable once you apply it."
184,osea,atmosphere protection cream,pimprod2017698,2570072," * I have clear non sensitive combo but very congestion and blemish prone skin so as much as I love natural brands it is very much a hit and miss. They are such quality formulas on paper however the excessive use of oils and butters leaves them causing issues for anyone remotrly congestion prone. While I loved this for a night or day moisturizer being so light milky yet amazingly hydrating absorbing effortlessly as if a water serum and leaving the best natural soft non greasy finish it ended up giving me endless red breakouts I have no doubt per all the algae and sea based ingredients plus oils that are a 50/50 chance of breaking out anyone acne prone. Happy for anyone these this product works for but sadly not me as I had hoped so much loving the mission of this brand and back to my staple Kbeauty brands that never fail me. I have loved Osea products but avoid their smoncare for years even with all the good reviews as had a feeling per their formulas they are majority not acne on congestion prone skin friendly per too many irritants even if natural and light formulas. Such a shame as adore the fresh scents and texture of this cream and their Ocean Wash but both wreaked havoc on my skin! * It feels super nice on the skin but it took so long to rub in which I didn't like. I wont be recommending this to my customers as a PBA at Ulta * I decided to buy this and try it out because I have heard awesome things about this brand and im OBSESSED! This is for sure going to be a staple in my house from now on! It smells like a baby and my skin is so soft! * Gives me HORRIBLE acne. Im not very acne prone but everytime I use this my face will breakout in unusual places for the next few days. * ive been using this since january 2024 & i love it so much! i got a free sample of the atmosphere cream and it def made me want the larger size. For referance i used to use the neutrogena hydroboost moisturizer haha this stuff is 10x better. Although it is a bit pricey I think its totally worth it. My skin glows like no other! I dont wear makeup so its important for my skin to be on 10 at all times. I also have combo skin and it doesnt make me feel oily or anything. Lastly, I bought the bottle at the beginning of April and its now Sept and ill probably buy another by the end of this month.. so the money goes a long way!! * I enjoyed using the product, the packaging is really good. It has a really nice smell without being strong. The only thing I don't like is that it's a bit pricey for the quantity. * They changed the formula and the smell is completely different. I used to love this product because it smelled like a spa. The new formula also does not feel as rich on the skin. This will be my last bottle. Too pricey and it is near impossible to get the last 1/4 of the product out of the jar,"

I am 75 years young and  have always had sensitive skin issues. This product is wonderful!  Feels great on my skin, no stickiness and my makeup looks so fresh; this moisturizer does everything the other brand did for me but at a more affordable price. This is my new go to moisturizer! * I got a sample of this cream and ordered it that very day. It is creamy and works well with or without makeup. * My skin is sensitive to breakouts. Usually when I use a very hydrating cream, I get pimples all over. This is the only cream that consistently gives me amazing results. No breakouts ever and applies like butter - super luxurious feeling (been using for a year now). So many other popular brands clog my pores badly. My skin stays clear with this and will continue to purchase for a long time. * i used this cream for months and it was perfect for my skin. Then they reformulate and now i can't use it al all. It gives me breakouts like I've never had before.  The same thing happened with the pink jar set. * My sensitive face started getting bumpy, red, and itchy after the first week of use. I threw it away. * This is my favorite cream. I have dry skin that occasionally (monthly)breaks out. This makes my skin feel so nice and my foundation goes on like a dream! I love the light scent as well. 10 out of 10!"
186,peter thomas roth,firmx collagen moisturizer,pimprod2014564,2561084," * Im really surprised by the negative reviews. I got a sample of this cream ans love how my skin feels ans looks when i use it. The price is exorbitant and is the only thing keeping me from making it my usual night cream (i work in retail so it takea half a shift to pay for it). I'll jusy have to watch for sales! * I bought the collagen cream to replace collagen masks. I am very pleased with the results after just a few days. After cleansing and toning, I massage a small amount into my skin. I allow it to dry completly and then use Philosohy Miracle Worker face cream over top of it. This gives me smooth, glass skin all day. My skin texture has markedly improved since adding the collagen cream. It is key to properly massage the collagen cream in and letting it dry before adding the second cream. I do not wear makeup, so I cannot speak to how it would layer. * I was really excited to try this and after a few weeks notice no results. * Leaves my skin soft. Will repurchase * I blend this with the  prayer Thomas water drench sheet tint moisturizer. Blends great! Firms my skin and doesn't feel greasy or heavy.  I use this as a foundation.  Quite  expensive for the combo‚Ä¶ but it works great with make up or just as a tinted moisturizer with mascara. * This is a great product and feels good on my skin, but I can't use it like other moisture products before applying my foundation because of pilling.. I now use only at night so I'm not putting anything over it. * I like it. I also drink collagen supplements so i think it works pretty well on top if it. Im only 23 so i dont have wrinkles to begin with but i will say that its pretty sticky going on and if you touch your face while its trying to dry than you will get the 'beads' like everyone else is saying but if you dont touch your face until its fully dry it will look normal"

A product like that in a tube that size, should not cost any more than $30. * My husband uses this product and has me order it again and again as it provides a good moisturizer to his face and keeps him safe in the sun!!! * Loooooved this SPF moisturizer, it worked perfectly on my face and did a great job protecting my skin from UV rays all day, but after finding out how potentially harmful oxybenzone can be I stopped using it & switched to a Cetaphil moisturizer instead. Wish they'd reformulate it so I could go back to using it again. * I personally wasn't a fan of this product. First I want to point out the sales associates at Ulta are super sexist to men and I got passed multiple times every time I asked for help literally ignored me. But back to this product, it's very similar to sun screen I prefer a thicker face lotion like the 2-1 face & beard but that got discontinued. * After years of using Vasaline Intensive Care lotion on his face, I convinced him to try the Clinique For Men Broad Spectrum SPF21 Moisturizer.  He loved it!  For a lotion with sun scree, it's not greasy and  it absorbs into the skin nicely leaving no residue. * If you've ever had a reaction to a sunscreen this one probably contains your culprit. Wore once and broke out in a rash/hives where it was applied. I will now be avoiding oxybenzone. * Applied it at the store to test it out and also bought some, a few hours later had a giant bump on my chin. Going to rerun it tomorrow."

I loved it from the start, but now, I'm noticing the changes in my skin over time. It's so much softer! My elbows feel as soft as the rest of my skin, the only time that's happened since infancy! It's a remarkable difference. * My fianc√© has been using this as a facial and hand lotion for several years. He consistently has dryness around his nose and mouth. This helps soothe those dry patches and doesn't add extra oiliness or contribute to breakouts in other areas of his face. * When you put it it on it feels thick. As it sets in you can feel the difference in your skin. You'll feel soft and moisturized. The only thing i would say is if it's hot outside and you have leather seats it will look as if there is an oil left behind. Other than that it does the job. * I read the reviews and was really excited about this lotion, but honestly my skin didn't like it at all. When I put it on I'm super greasy and the product doesn't absorb into my skin. I have leather seats in my car and the product gets all over. I was even transferring product on tables at restaurants. Also it smells just like vegetable oil. I was so disturbed how I smelled with this lotion because I felt like an oiled up pig or something about to be deep fried. Do not recommend. * Great lotion. Great for dry skin. * This is my favorite go to daily moisturizer - it instantly moisturizes and plumps my skin for hours. I am a repeat buyer - plus you get a lot of product for your $$ * It was dermatologist recommendation to me for my very dry but sensitive skin. It is thick feeling going on but my skin absorbs it quickly.  Love it!"

I will always recommend using this product * I'm not sure why this happened if my skin is really good with salicylic acid in fact it prefers it then benzyl peroxide so I decided to try this out. I put it on overnight after my moisturizer as much as my pointer finger and I woke up the next day, my breakouts worse so I just stopped using it right then and there kind of disappointed was hoping for good results.ü•∫ * I love how it feels on my skin and i think it would add hydration to my skin. * My daughter tried the face wash and this gel and her face had a terrible reaction. No, no new foods or other items. She immediately began burning. Her face is like this on both sides and she has never had sensitive reaction to any other product. * I have dry, but clear skin. However, summertime + makeup = sweaty breakouts. So to stay on top of it, I started using this product once daily during my nighttime routine. Started working in just a few days of use. Now, instead of having several problem areas after a full day of wearing a full face of  makeup and sweating, I maybe have just small baby blemish that resolves itself overnight. It also does not dry out my skin more than it already is, if anything my skin has been feeling softer and more hydrated. I use La Roche Posay double repair moisturizer and it works well alongside it. With how well this has worked for me, I'm excited to try more products from them. Highly recommend! * i love this brand so much i've literally never been disappointed with any of their stuff but my makeup grips onto this like the hydro grip primer i am in love!! I've always had issues with layering and pilling no matter what i changed before but this product is crazy good and makes it easy, here to repurchase AGAIN. please good molecules never stop making this product and just try it especially if u have oily or combo skin"

It feels great never greasy or oily and really helps if my face hurts. * My skin feels well nourished and not greasy after putting this on my face. * I personally love this one, but it's gone too soon because it's liquidy (i like the consistency though). I mix it with a bit of Cortisone and its a great moisturizer with redness calming effect. I wish I could afford to buy one every month. * I LOVE this stuff! I had acne and a horrible red rash all over my neck. Used this after my nightly shower, and woke up with an 80% reduction of redness. Used it again that morning, and the redness was gone by that night. I use it religiously to keep my neck hydrated and rash free. I highly recommend it! * A couple years ago my face started getting really red and patchy. I tried a few other moisturizers and none of them helped. I found out that my redness is caused by Post-Inflammatory Erythema so I started looking for products to calm inflammation and decided to give this a try and I'm so glad I did! I use the matching cleanser and I noticed relief right away. With continued use of the cleanser and this moisturizer, along with a few other products, my redness and inflammation have calmed down so much it's crazy. It's very lightweight and a little goes a long way! I like that it doesn't start to pill if I accidentally use too much and it's great under makeup. I don't even use a primer anymore, I just make sure this moisturizer has had enough time to settle into my skin before applying foundation. It can make your skin look a little greasy if you use too much or don't rub it in enough but I just use an oil absorbing sheet and gently pat my face to relieve that. Overall I'm very happy with this product line and will definitely keep coming back! * I basically got a chemical burn from a name brand ""for acne prone sensitive skin"" face wash. Then I had to try every moisturizer for sensitive acne prone skin to keep it from being so dry.
After one use, the dryness/redness is GONE this morning! It doesn't burn/sting. It's not greasy. ‚ô•Ô∏è * I bought this product because I love their Snail Rescue Serum plus I struggle with redness in my cheek and nose area, especially in cold/dry weather. This product does little (if anything at all) for my redness and it's very greasy looking for daytime use. It's also a gel, not a cream, which I usually love but it didnt sink into my skin the way gels usually do. I ended up just using this as a nighttime barrier during winter and it was nice because it definitely has moisturizing properties, however, I would not purchase again because it doesn't do what it says it does plus it's pretty pricey for the amount you get."
196,vanicream,facial moisturizer broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2042402,2619672," * I brought this on vacation as my only moisturizer and I regretted it because of how thick it is. I have oily skin and it just felt really heavy on my face. I was expecting something as light and gentle as the vanicream cleanser but it was definitely a lot thicker than expecting. I would use this as a face sunscreen and for my tattoos, but probably not as a standalone moisturizer. * I purchased this product because my usual was not available and I found it to be even better! Great moisturizer and sunblock in one! * I love Vanicream and have the face wash and moisturizer but this spf and moisturizer blend is too much for the daytime and leaves oily skin greasy. * I really liked that this product did not flair up my eczema and did not sting my eyes. However, for a long period i had breakouts and could not figure out why i was getting these itchy whiteheads and i finally figured out this guy was the culprit. I went a month without using jt and had clear skin two days ago then I decided to use this sunscreen over my Hero green sunscreen (highly recommened for all skin types). I completely broke out again in itchy white heads and cystic acne. Idk what chemical it is but there's something in this product that is not suitable for large pores and acne prone girlies. The regular moisturizer is nice and i honestly thought the sunscreen and moisturizer were similar besides the zinc oxide added but no they are completely different. Try it and see if it works for you but just know that it could break you out. Not a sponsership but the Hero cosmetics sunscreen that has a green tint is the best sunscreen ive ever had. I have combo skin so some days im super dry or some days i am oily and this girl works everday plus it is not heavily fragranced like others * I really wanted to like this sunscreen since i have had good luck with other vanicream products since they are for sensitive skin. However, this made my face super itchy and it was so distracting. This may not work with everyone for sensitive skin. * A little greasy at first but it sets in nice, especially if your skin tends to be a little on the dry side. I have had ongoing skin issues with my face (yeast) so i cannot have anything too heavy/greasy and this does okay! It does have a sunscreen smell, which i dont mind but some might. * I love this Mineral sunscreen. It is thicker than most and does take 20 minutes to dry down. I do 2 applications to achieve that 2 finger rule. When I reapply a 2nd and 3rd time it does get oily but again I recommend waiting the full 15 minutes. After it dries down I do see some white caste but I'll gently rub it more into my skin. I wish Vanicream made a mineral, water resistant, no fragrance, spf. I recommend if you have sensitive skin or need a good reliable Mineral sunscreen. Please do not change ingredients."

I have maturing skin, i am 50yo, and this is a perfect daytime moisturizer, light but very moisturizing.  It makes an awesome canvas for makeup or alone gice you a slight glow.  It works well with the other serums I use.  I use it daily every morning and at night i use the hydra zen cream. * I've been wearing this for about a couple years now. This is a must have. I do have the whole pink Hydra Zen collection. I do use the other products occasionally, the Rose Facial Scrub a couple times a week. I use Hyra Zen twice a day - morning and when i get home from work i wash my face and apply it again. I also been keeping it in the fridge lately and love it. I have gotten many compliments. I facetimed my brother one day - he said sis you look good! He said your skin looks great, what are you using lol. I laughed, thanked him, told him I have no makeup on, then told him I use Lancome Hydra Zen Glow but I put it on like 10-12 hours ago, like at 5am when I was getting ready for work lol  When I finally got home I put all the Lancome products I have together, took a pic and sent it to him. * Ive been using this product for 6 months and the benefits have been amazing. I have a dark complexion and it does wonders on my wintery dry skin. I am about to purchase my second bottle!!!! * messed up my makeup every time I used it. had to trash all my makeup sponges * It feels great in my face * Too sticky and didn't get any benefit from this one. * A beautiful moisturizer for the Summer.

I love it. * Love Clinique, great for mature skin, love Ulta they have everything you need! * Love their cleansing balm, absolutely the best. Been an ""it"" girl forever, figured I'd give it a try. Could tell a difference in just a couple days! * I love this moisturizer. I just feel it being absorbed into my skin. A little pricey but Ultas discount was great . * This rich cream offers extra moisture without being heavy.  Feels great on skin.  It really works on fine lines too.  I use the clinical repair serum and eye cream also."
199,peach slices,redness relief color correcting moisturizer,pimprod2037238,2605747," * I love this product for the color match and finish. It's not matte, but not too shiny. I recommend to shake the product in the bottle before using, and if your skin type is oily, you may want to stay away. 

The biggest con is that this product STINKS. It smells sooo bad, and I know its not because it's expired because I've repurchased this product at least 3 times from different locations (even online) and every time it smells the same. * during the shipping process the product separated and I believe it was expired as well. It smelled so bad i couldn't even apply it. * The consistency does not match * I don't know how they did it, but it somehow smells like butt and feet. Mine also is very separated and shaking it a ton *kind of* worked but still isnt mixing well. Very oily! Will probably be returning which is a shame because I can tell the color is great but i just can't with the consistency. * This product arrived either defective or expired.  It was super runny and separated.  Basically just had to throw it away. * I took a chance on this product despite negative customer reviews on the strength of some glowing write-ups in consumer magazines. I really regret doing that now. Maybe it's partly because this product was delivered to me HOT, but it started off uncontrollably oily and separated. I shook it to incorporate and let it cool down, but it's still incredibly thick and greasy even as a room temperature paste. It pills slightly when used in combination with other products. I don't wear makeup ‚Äî maybe you could fix it with a matte setting spray, but I'd say that's a last resort. It's genuinely uncomfortable to have on your face.
Two stars because, like other reviewers have said, it is really good at doing what it says it's going to do. It definitely reduces redness, but it will come at the expense of your loved ones (and bolder acquaintances) asking you why your face is so weirdly slick and shiny. Would not recommend. * This product is like nasty smelling water.  I shook it and shook it and shook it and I'm not getting anything except for liquid which makes absolutely no sense in a tube, so I'm not sure if something is wrong with this or this is a terrible product design because I end up, spilling it no matter what I do when I try to get some product to use.  But I tried applying some anyway, and I don't see it doing anything.  This was a complete waste of money."

But it seems to work its way into my eyes, and it stings for a long time. I don't think I will buy it again, but it is good enough. * Thats all jusy buy it! * purchased this due to the spf rating. I use Olay sensitive during the winter months and usually add Neutrogena SPF, but I found this product this spring and decided to try it. I absolutely love. I use serum first and then this. I absorbs nicely and doesn't leave my skin sticky. I use under my eyes and my eye lids and I do not experience any burning.

202,charlotte tilbury,travel size magic cream moisturizer with hyaluronic acid,pimprod2043572,2619312," * I was very disappointed with this product. I truly don't believe facial products, especially moisturizers which remain on skin for a longer period of time, should have such strong, perfume-like fragrances/scents. I found this extremely objectionable.  Sorry * This moisturizer is amazing.    It really is magic.   I will buy this again and again and also get a a gift for my sister * l love it * I needed a moisturizer than could tackle my very dry skin and this is it. * Great product * Its a decent moisturizer thats true. It feels very hydrating and creamy on my dry skin, however it doesnt feel like it gets absorbed easier. If you have oily skin you may not like the thick and shiny finish that stays on pretty much forever. 

On the side note, there is literally no difference between the before and after photo for wrinkle reduction‚Ä¶not sure what its trying to show LOL, I sure didn't see major changes on my skin. * the product is very hydrating and great for the winter. downside is that it leaks a little bit."

Hydration good but you may need more than three pumps for more effect. I only use maybe one pump. * I really love this brand but this is a miss for me. This is the first product that i actually dont even want to keep using until it's done. I like it bc it's a heavier moisturizer, but i cant get it anywhere near my eyes. Also, i went into the ocean with just this on and it burned my eyes worse then straight chemical sunscreen. And i just read the other review saying it's not reef safe. Come on now...i expected better from this brand. * I have tried sunscreens from every brand, price range, and formulation... the only one that holds up to this is a ""bomb"" Korean one, and it's a bit more expensive. My cream concealer blends right in, but I will admit that I have to set this with powder before I use a powder foundation, especially if I plan on buffing it in. For the price point, you can't beat this one.

P.S. Hey, Pacifica, please don't discontinue this like my Vitamin C & Sheer SPF 50 serum üò≠ and my pineapple curls curl cream. I swear I love so much of what you produce, and then y'all switch up on me with discontinuing my faves... the betrayal is REAL TO ME! l * I love these products.

While this product smelled amazing, and soaked in great...I started breaking out. I couldn't figure it out for a week!

Not only are octyl salicylate and octocrylene not reef safe, but they also break me out terribly with what feels more like a burn. Stay away, if not for yourself - for the environment. * I was very excited to find a daily moisturizer with the bonus of having sun protection. However, I don't want to smell like I'm going to the beach at work (or anywhere else for that matter). It's kinda heavy and makes your eyes water from burning. * I absolutely love this moisturizer!!

It was a relief to my very irritated skin diring pregnancy and now postpartum. The only downside is that I wish it wasnt so small for the price. But its worth it for a product i finally don't react to! * This stuff is amazing. I have Perioral dermatitis and I have tried all the creams. This one has truly worked in helping my get rid of it. Don't be discouraged that the balm is somewhat thick (many recommend lightweight moisturizers for PD). It truly does the trick. * I tried this product for 2 weeks and I now have dry flaky skin on my cheeks and nose. I bought this product because I have sensitive skin that gets a little drier in the winter months, but my skin has never been this dry in my life! 
Pros: it dries quickly and applys nice under makeup. Not greasy. 
Cons: dried up my skin into a flaky mess. * Since I have hypothyroidism, my skin was always super dry and I would have a lot of rashes as a result. But, this lotion is sensitive enough not to irritate my skin furthermore and durable enough to lock in moisture to eliminate dryness without clogging up my pores. Happy i came across this brand because I have wasted a lot of money before finding this product. * Please never remove this. It's the only moisturizer I've ever been able to use without triggering my acne!! I never have any product related breakouts anymore!! Finding a good moisturizer that worked for my skin was soo hard. This is so perfect and I've been using it for probably a year now. * I use retinol and aha products regularly so every now and then my skin peels and gets red and sensitive. I have tried a lot of soothing and calming products on the market to fix my occasionally irritated skin but so far this one is the only one that doesn't hurt when applied and that actually calms my skin down. I have used both its cream and balm version. They are both great but I like the balm one a little better. * Glides onto the skin nicely and leaves a nice hydrated finish to the skin.

I don't know what they put in it so get my skin so so buttery soft but it's more than just hydrated, the texture is very unique. Its just sooo soft and feels amazing. It's hard to explain, but it's definitely more than moisturized. It's silky! It's awesome. I just want to feel my skin over and over again. The scent is so nice too. I love the experience of putting it on , there so many sensory luxuries to it. The scent, the texture of it when you put it on, the way your skin looks and feels afterwords is so nice. I'm hitting my 40s and definitely need help in terms of dryness , wrinkles, and loss of elasticity. This hits all those boxes in just one cream! This is must for all ages in my opinion. If I would had wore this in my younger years, my skin would be so different. If just wearing this for over a week transforms my skin , i wonder what more time would do. I definitely recommend this for wrinkles , loss of firmness and dry or even not so soft skin. Its amazing! * I honestly loved this cream. It works like a charm! I've been trying it for the past week and let me tell you, it does actually lift. Also the packaging and the bottle itself is so aesthetically pleasing. I received this cream as promo for my review. * At 42, I started noticing the signs of aging showing up faster than I expected‚Äîlooser skin, a drooping look, and a loss of that youthful glow.

As another review mentioned it seems to pill. * Made my foundation peel right off. The primer itself feels nice ans hydating but would not recommend putting makeup on top. * I use this product every day with or without makeup, it feels so nice on my skin and keeps it hydrated and gives it a nice glow. * Had such high hopes due to multiple influencers recommending this product. Didn't notice much difference in the appearance of my combo, dehydrated skin. Worst of all id the fact that this product PILLS and doesn't play nice with much of any other skincare products nor makeup. Really wanted this to work! * I used this religiously from the ages of 15-17 and it was my favorite makeup product. I reordered it on sale last week at the age of 25 and it is still so amazing, but not hydrating enough for me anymore. I love the smell, its super light but lingers in the best way. I will still use it and probably reorder but will be prepping with a heavier moisturizer before applying this under makeup. I also really love it for a no makeup makeup day because it just seems to make my skin even and glowy. * I just turned 44 and am feeling it. I purchased a bag of new products including this moisturizer on the recommendation of 2 employees. I wore it for the first time on Thursday with mascara and eyeshadow. A female coworker told me, ""I hope that this doesn't get me into trouble, but your face looks so good. You have the natural glow of someone that just had a good time."" So needless to say I will wear this every day for the rest of my life."

Unfortunately, this product was the cause of acne and a rosacea-like reaction. Had to stop immediately. * This was my first time trying a TULA face product and I had an allergic reaction. Not too long after applying this product to my freshly cleaned face and neck I started to develop an allergic reaction with tiny rashes all over where the product was applied. It was painful and itchy. Unfortunately this didn't work for me. * I got this as a gift and got a bunch of red bumps on my skin, do not buy! * This light-weight moisturizer truly does promote bright, clear skin. Don't expect it to completely remove dark spots, however. I recommend an entire skin care regimen that will assist you with balanced, even skin tone. * This feels hydrating and great. I've already noticed changes and will continue to use Tula! * I love this moisturizer. I have sensitive skin that becomes dry and dull in the winter. The moisturizer does not irritate my skin and keeps my skin moisturized all day long. It smells great too! * 1.7 oz of product which will last you barely a month. for the price it is not worth it."

So it you have scaly eczema or any kind of eczema buy this!! * I purchased this for my husband as he has some dry flakey skin around his nose . Typically he uses aquaphor , this is even better and not as greasy. You can use it on your entire body.

The morning after first use my skin didn't feel uncomfortable anymore.  That same evening the flaking was done.  Three days later, most of my eczema patches have gone away and the remaining ones are significantly improved.  This product has saved me a lot of discomfort and self-consciousness already. * I've tried everything from eczema honey to homeopathic balms, and this is one of the few things that will calm down my eczema!

I have oily skin and i use this as a part of my nightime routine. It absorbs very well, and super light weight. It doesnt have a smell and a little goes a long way. I would totally recommend. * Unfortunately not a good fit for my combination oily skin. Feels nice initially going on, and there's definitely some oil control benefit. However I've noticed that it makes my dry patches even drier and more flakey with consistent use. Could be a good fit for someone without dryness. * Beware that this product might burn your skin. I used it as recommended and it left bright red marks on my neck and face. * This might be fine in the summer but definitely not moisturizing enough for me in fall/winter. I find my skin is oily and tight half way through the day. It is cooling on the skin and decent under a tinted moisturizer. * This product has helped my oiliness slightly, and did not irritate the sensitive areas on my face, and doesn't burn when applying. It soaks in quickly, and my skin feels refreshed afterward. I don't see why I wouldn't continue to use this product. There is no scent, which I appreciate. * I liked. * I have had trouble finding a good go-to lotion thats not greasy, and this is amazing. I use it everyday AM and PM, and it leaves my face feeling so smooth and clean without the feeling of a heavy moisturizer. I would compare this to the belif aqua bomb, just even more lightweight."

Really happy they have it in a kit. * I am a die hard PTR fan at this point! This moisturizer is soooo nice and lithtweight but ultra hydrating, leaving 0 greasiness! Highly recommend!
And I love using the eye masks in the morning as I get ready for the day; it perks your skin and eyes right up! * The eye patches didn't do anything for the dark circles under my eyes and the moisturizer wasn't enough for the desert climate that I live in. * One of my favorite moisturizers. My eyes are very sensitive and many moisturizers, and serums cause them to burn if I use them around my face. Not these and I love the moisturizer for morning and night. * My skin is always dry even after trying other moisturizers the next day its super dry.

221,first aid beauty,ultra repair face moisturizer with spf 30,pimprod2037708,2606963," * If it didnt specify that its a face moisturizer with sunscreen you would think that its just a typical sunscreen for your face. It has no hydrating effect whatsoever and it leaves white streaks. I combine it with their hydrating facial moisturizer and it works well, but at that point I have to buy two products to get the one result this product should accomplish by itself. Overall I don't think its worth it if you're looking for a good moisturizer that has sunscreen added. * I received a sample of this sunscreen and am buying another bottle. This is a perfect sunscreen if you have dry or sensitive skin. It is a very thick, creamy formula. My skin feels hydrated all day, and I didn't experience any breakouts like I have from other sunscreens. Because it's a mineral sunscreen, it doesn't burn your eyes if you sweat. However, buyer beware! The zinc in it will leave a white cast, which is typical for mineral sunscreens. This is not a good option for deeper skin tones if you are looking to avoid a white cast. * This has decent moisturizing properties, however leaves a white cast on your face. * No matter how much I rub it in, I look like a ghost after I use this product * I have very sensitive skin and love First aid beauty moisturizer. With it being summer I tried the spf version & it left my face white. Will be returning for the original. * its so thick and leaves the worst white cast ever. im returning it now. * This product dried my face out and clogged my pores"

It feels so luxurious when you out it on and ot instantly changes rhe way my face feels and my skin is lotetally glowing. Super happy i found thid snd will pribably be using this forever! * I would use this even if it didn't contain Vitamin C because it is so moisturizing; it is like a layer of protective cushion for your skin. The fact it contains the stable form of Vitamin C that most dermatologists prefer to recommend is of course THE reason to use it. I also LOVE that they didn't add fragrance to mask the  normal smell of the vitamin C ingredient. Yes, that odd ""hot dog?"" scent is just what the vitamin C smells like, and it dissipates in less than a minute. * Bought this product about a month ago, I was worried at first about spending so much money, but it was time to drop the dime. I'll be turning 35 soon and my skin was dull, dry and sometimes had red patches that would burn when using other creams, correctors and moisturizers. 
Since using this product my skin looks just as young and fresh as it did in my 20's!
I will definitely be purchasing this again when I run out. * Started using this product about a month ago and I love how dewy and hydrated my skin looks. It has also helped with my skin tone.

That being said, I have very sensitive acne prone skin, and this did not irritate my skin except for around my eyes, and did not leave much white cast. * I have used this moisturizer for YEARS! I suffer from dry skin and all other moisturizers would cause my face to have little white flakes on it.

Product was like hardened vaseline and it WOULD NOT COME OFF.  It moved toward my eyelashes and now I am constantly wiping my eyes (days later). This is a horrible product and I am not sure how to get it off my eyelids.  It seems to be clogging each eyelash pore. I cannot BELIEVE they'd make such a product and I am THROUGH with ""free"" samples.  It's not free if it is going to pull out eyelashes and cost money to see an eye doctor and possibly derm MD.

The NECK firming cream has a nice light sent. * I got a sample of this product with the purchase and I can't see how well it works because there was barely enough in the package to get around my eyes, but let me tell you this stuff smells toxic, toxic, toxic it literally smelt like I was putting something industrial on my face. I'm shocked that this has such good reviews and I literally had my jaw drop when I saw how expensive this was when looking it up to write this review * I really like this moisturizer. I feel that it does have a firming affect and feels great, even under make up. I have been using it for a year. Its just too expensive and there are cheaper alternatives now. I really wish these companies woukd stop ripping us off for a jar of face lotion.

The only con is that its a little ""too"" moisturizing and is always the final step if my routine because ntohing can go on top of it. * Got this as sample. Suoer greasy, stayed ontop of my skin.

It brings my skin to life with every application! I need a lifetime supply * I'm not super picky when it comes to moisturizers but this one was really not good.

To my surprise, my skin was only getting worse. It was starting to burn and itch. I've been allergy tested, and I don't have any. The day I didn't use the sunscreen, my skin condition immediately disappeared, so I went to look at the ingredients list. I don't know if Origins is using the oils from grapefruit, lemon and orange for fragrance purposes, but it does not list anywhere that they have extracted the furanocoumarins. After meeting with my dermatologist, I was advised that the citrus oils used in the sunscreen caused photosensitivity, and burned/ irritated my skin.

I'm honestly shocked at other reviews saying they broke out as I have acne prone skin and never have but YMMV. * This is a decent sunscreen, rubs in fine and makes my skin soft. However this burns my eyes soooo bad. Obviously I know to not get sunscreen in my eyes, but it doesn't matter how carefully I put it on, my eyes burn. I have very sensitive & dry eyes and it just doesn't work. The Tula one in the yellow bottle, is the one I continue to go back too. * I was very excited to try this but was disappointed to find the results being similar to a drug store brand product not to mention this product caused my skin to break out and become oily. Never had those issues with my skin before starting to use this. Also the product just pours out of the bottle causing you to end up wasting product every time you use it which makes you run out a lot faster than you would expect. * I have heard great things about Murad so I finally decided to treat myself to this moisturizer. I wanted to love it SO bad but my skin has BLOWN UP with acne so bad, it's starting to really get to me. I used to struggle with acne but it had gotten to be almost non-existed until I bought this. At first I thought my pregnancy hormones had caused my flare up, and it could be a contributor, but this is really the only new piece of my skincare regimen and it seems like others have had the same bad experience as me too. Will be throwing it away and buying my old moisturizer. * As always, every experience can be different but I'll tell you mine: I have very sensitive skin , dry to normal, rarely have acne besides the occasional pimple. When I started using this, my face broke out like a crunch bar. TONS of bumps and several pimples. I started a new night cream at the same time so I wasn't sure, but as soon as I stopped using this my face cleared. It was pretty instant, at the end of the day the bumps were the worst and I would wash my face and wake up to no bumps (not what happens with typical acne). If you haven't heard of acne cosmetica, google it that way you can watch out for it with this product or any others.

I wish this worked out. * After having my baby, part of my postpartum recovery included extremely dry skin around my chin and T-zone area. It was SOOOOOO bad. My makeup application was the worst showing patchy skin. I tried so many things to help, including high-end luxurious products, but nothing worked until I tried this for weeks. I saw it changed the texture of my skin that included smoother and moisturized skin. I love it so much, I just bought a second one. The scent is also light. Nothing too crazy. This was good to my sensitive skin. Highly recommend!!!! * This product did make my skin feel feel and look amazing.  However, it also caused acne breakouts that I hadn't experienced in many years.  For that reason, I can't use this product.  I wasn't prone to breakouts so it was a bit surprising. * Smooth and penetrates well. Skin feels soft and smooth"

One of the best ones in the market, im sad they don't sell the big size at Ulta anymore.): * very hydrating, it relieves my eczema and acne-prone skin. the large tub basically lasts forever. only downside is ulta doesn't sell the large size of this anymore :( * I actually received a travel size of this water cream in my Ipsy bag and I absolutely loved it! It made my skin so soft and moisturized! It also seemed to make my face brighter and opened my pores more as well! Definitely recommend! * I initially received this product in an Ipsy order and liked it so much that I got the full version from Ulta. My skin is mostly quite dry with the exception of my nose and eyes, so I apply this everywhere else first and use the leftovers in my oily zones. I have very textured, damaged skin, but this product makes it feel smooth and silky and it lasts all day for me. I love it as skin prep as well! * This goes on so lovley a d glowy unitk it dries then its tight and sticky i really wish it would stay hydrated and glowy hiw iy goes on * I like using this during summer and its light weight"

Gives a glass-like, dewy skin finish. I can wear it with just my tinted SPF and my skin looks great all day. * This moisturizer is genuinely the best and the highest quality i have ever used. I have dry skin with dry patches and while this doesnt get rid of the patches it definitely relieves them the most compared to other products. Better than drunk elephant and better than cerave. The only con is it is soooo expensive. It it honestly worth it to me * This moisturizer is genuinely the best and the highest quality i have ever used.

The only con is it is soooo expensive. It it honestly worth it to me * I received this product for free and I loved this product so much! It was so lightweight and hydrating, also leaving me with a total glow! Would highly recommend this product if your looking for a lightweight moisturizer. * This is the absolute best moisturizer and provides a beautiful glow. The 1.7 oz jar last me 3-4 months and leaves my skin supple. * This review is 100% honest & true: 
I'm 43, menopause. My skin is desperately dry, withered, wrinkled, lost density, and now acneic. üò´
This cream is sensational. I live in arid dry cold Colorado and this cream is very viscous - like elmers glue! It remains on the skin hours later, sealing in plumping moisture, but NOT occlusive. Great ingredients list, zero fragrance, and wears well under tinted SPF. High shine though - so I use a setting powder over it in some places. Not causing break outs, and lessens the appearance of fine lines."
237,beautybio,the zenbubble oil-free calming gel cream,pimprod2019384,2572411," * Someone at ulta recommended me this one, really pricey to me, I usually dont spend over 30 on moisturizers, but this is one of my favorites (not enough for me to consistently buy it though). Goes on light, a little goes a long way I'd say, I have combination skin that used to be really oily but now is rather dry, I'd say it's fine for all skin types personally. Also it comes out by pressing down on it, whenever it runs low you can twist to get the rest of it. I was stressing out trying to get it out before realizing it opens. Again, would buy this all the time if not for the pricing, but pretty worth it * I've purchased this two times now and am loving how light it feels on the skin while being super hydrating for my dry skin. The container pump makes it so easy to apply. * I got this and the eye cream, both burned my eyes and skin. I am sensitive but don't usually break out in a few hours from a product. Also were very sticky long after applying just them and no other products for self testing. * Far from a moisturizer but in fact left my skin super oily. * Hands down the best makeup primer EVER. Its too good. My makeup looks freshly applied all day long. I csnt say enough about it. * I spent alot on this and it did nothing for me. I like how the product is provided. The moisturizer itself caused skin irritation after I used appropriate face cleanser foe skin type. Not for eczema prone or sensitive skin! * The formula is fine‚Äînothing amazing‚Äîand there are similar moisturizers at a more affordable pricepoint. I have combo sensitive skin and it didn't irritate my skin. I do really like it when i mix it with my retinol oil at night as it helps dry down the oil faster and keep in the moisture. The packaging is my favorite part with the pump top. When i'm out of this, i'll refill it with my cetaphil night cream. I got it when it was half off but i still think it's too expensive for what it is."

I liked the feel of the formula and it rubbed in well. It's a larger size than many other bottles of face sunscreen. Thats the 2nd star. And I bougnt 2 of these. Nope. Never again. * As someone who breaks out to a lot of different skincare products, this is one of the few sunscreens that doesn't. I found no irritation around my eyes when I applied it, and it left no white cast on my medium skin! I love to buy it when its on sale. * This has been my go-to daily SPF ever since I started dealing with FA breakouts. I live in a very dry climate and find this is all the hydration I need for daytime. Lightweight feeling, doesn't pill or sting near my eyes, and plays nicely under makeup. Also layers/reapplies nicely throughout the day. Would love to eventually see a higher SPF in this same formula that's also FA-safe! * I like it! It's a small bottle, but, I like it! I think it lives up to it's claim: my face appears to be smoother, feels softer. * I like it! It's a small bottle, but, I like it! I think it lives up to it's claim: my face appears to be smoother, feels softer. * Bummer that this is now 5 mL smaller than before but costs exactly the same. * Not great for sensitive skin.

Very gentle for the results I've seen! Will be sure to purchase again!

I do two layers before going to bed, its so good! I also enjoy the smell as well and its not too overpowering. The price is ok and I enjoyed it more than the Tatcha water cream I tried and its a lot more expensive! * I recommend this product to EVERYBODY. This stuff right here has completely changed my life. I get compliments on my skin all the time since ive started using this in 2022. I will never stop using it!!! * I have used this product every day, twice a day since 2017. I absolutely love it! It is lightweight, dries down smooth, and helps hydrate my oily sensitive skin. I would cry if FAB ever discontinued this product. 1000% would recommend. * This is a great moisturizer super lightweight better for like oily or skin types. But I like it as a quick little water cream to add to whatever else I'm using for the day. Smells delicious and love coconut so for me, this is a must have! * This product is amazing, it's so light weight and smells amazing.

I have skin that is on the drier side, and this cream made my skin feel so plush, keeps my skin moisturized all day, and It's my winter go-to cream! Please don't stop selling! * Im on my 5th pot and about to order more. My skin looks hydrated and dewy after application. Not sticky, smells clean. * my fav night moisturizer. i have sensitive/dehydrated skin and it is perfect for it, not perfume scented and has really made a difference in my skin. i've purchased twice and recieved as a gift from the bf :) will continue to rebuy for sure. * I was attracted to the packaging and the name of this cream, so I decided to try it. It's nongreasy, unscented formula glides onto the skin smoothly. It's lightweight and is great for morning and night use. I like it so much that I went back to buy more ""good light"" products! * My new go to moisturizer! I have sensitive combo skin and my skin just loves the hydration this leaves all day. My skin feels so soft and healthy after using it. Nice enough in the summer alone but even better for the fall/winter in the midwest over their abc oil. Fragrance free too."

Texture not as creamy as I like, but it is a very good moisturizer! * Love this cream best moisturizer light and hydrating. * Wonderful moisture infusion cream! Peter Thomas Roth is the best! * I was skeptical at first, but have noticed less wrinkles under my eyes and my makeup applies smoother * Amazing peptide complex and anti aging results * I splurged on this product as I felt my skin needed just a good moisturizer that locked everything in and protected it. The product is heavier than most but I feel it does a great job of hydrating my skin. The biggest con I have is the blue painted lid on the jar peels and leaves blue fragments of paint in the product, thus it going on my face. My fingertips are physically blue after simply unscrewing the cap. It actually concerns me because you never know what companies are using to manufacture their products. Disappointed with such a high price point. * Ive been using PTR products for 10+ years and my skin shows amazing results from the use of these products over the years.

I have tried others, but always go back to this product.  Now I highly recommend this lotion for aging skin! * This moisturizer has been my go-to for years. I have sensitive skin and I have been using it on my face since 2019. My skin stays hydrated, glowy, and clear of any blemishes when I use this moisturizer compared to any other moisturizer I've used. This is really shocking but great considering the price of this product compared to other skincare. I take this with me and use it all year! It also has worked great on keeping me moisturized on my legs, where I'm prone to eczema. Everyone's skin is different, but mine really loves this moisturizer! ü©∑ * i have acne prone combination skin, it seems to be clogging my pores and giving me closed comedones * I absolutely love the Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion, Hydrating Body Moisturizer! It provides amazing hydration without feeling heavy or sticky, which is a big plus for me. My skin feels soft and nourished all day long, and I don't have to worry about it feeling greasy or tacky. I also appreciate that it has no fragrance, so it's perfect for sensitive skin or anyone who prefers unscented products. It's become a staple in my skincare routine, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a simple, effective moisturizer. * This is a very hydrating moisturizer! I would definitely recommend it if you have dry skin! However, a little bit goes a long way. If I accidentally put too much on, ot makes my skin feel greasy. I would recommend this product though! * Broke me out * I haven't used it on my face, however I did on my body. It is thick but glides into skin. I agree with others it's a little tacky feeling but subsides fairly quick. That being said I give it 4 stars. My skin after a few days is more hydrated and healthier looking."
248,hero cosmetics,clear collective clarifying prebiotic moisturizer,pimprod2030350,2591989," * I've tried many moisturizers (high end & affordable) for sensitive/acne prone skin and this is by far the best moisturizer, especially for the price! I use this with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide or salicylic acid and it pairs well with all my serums and sunscreen. This is also great under makeup since it's not oily and helps makeup last longer. I've repurchased this moisturizer at least 4 times and I always have a backup! * I love that this moisturizer is buildable. You xan relaly control how much you need. It feels great on my skin and my skin is noticeably more plump. I love it! * I am acne-prone but need a moisturizer for skin dryness, especially during the winter when the cold wind easily dries out your skin. After using this moisturizer, I have had several instances of bad luck with getting a new pimple the next morning. The texture and application (no burning) of this product are fine. It does its job to moisturize the skin. However, not without suffering more blemishes sadly. I picked this while trying to find noncomedogenic moisturizers with clean ingredients according to Yuka, but my mom helped point out to me later this has vegetable oil in it‚Ä¶ Cool! üôÉ * its just perfect and a little goes a long way * I dont really know what people are saying about this product, most people are saying its lightweight and non greasy but it feels so heavy, sticky, and greasy on my face, maybe just not for me but I won't be buying this again * I have sensitive skin and this works well for me. Love that it isnt too heavy on my combo/acne prone skin * I was hoping this product would work well on my acne-prone skin, but it doesn't seem to do much for me. It doesn't absorb very well into the skin so the more you use the more ends up sitting on your face. The claims about this moisturizer being pre-biotic don't seem to mean much. Hero specializes in products for acne and acne-prone skin, so I assumed this moisturizer would work well in my routine and be hydrating but I was disappointed."

I put them on at night and woke up with visibly plumper skin and less wrinkles. I can see myself using these every two weeks or so as part of my skin routine! * I had high hopes for these especially for the price. I liked how tight they felt when i put them on my under eye line. I slept with them on and was so excited to see the results when when i woke up. However, there was no change. If anything i feel like one line looks deeper. * I love love love this product. I have deep forehead wrinkles and this has helped soo much. * I wore these overnight like instructed and when I took them off in the morning I had much more pronounced and deep wrinkles. I look 15 years older. Literally does the opposite of what it's suppose to. Now I'm just praying these new wrinkles fade. * It's just temporary, so keep that in mind. * These are not very strong and theyre small. If you havent tried ""frownies"" i suggest trying those. Theyre cheaper for a larger quantity and better results. * I tried these on a few spots on my face, under eyes, smile lines, and 11 lines on forehead. I honestly wouldnt bother using these under your eyes because the adhesive is so strong it pulls at your skin even with wetting them. They did work well on my smile lines and 11 lines but they just soften the wrinkles, my results only lasted about 1 week. Personally I'd invest in a good quality eye cream over using these patches."

I love the idea of a gel-cream moisturizer but most have not been moisturizing enough. This one is lightweight and moisturiziing without being too much or too little for my skin. This is my new holy grail! * I'm 46 with combo/dry aging skin. I've used $100.00 K-Beauty moisturizers, Est√©e Lauder, Lancome, Tatcha, Glow Recipe, etc... I bought the COSRX Oil Free Moisturizer in a pinch and actually like it! I use the Kate Sommerville Eradikate daily cleanser with my PTR Soniclear Elite followed by Mamonde Rose Toner during the day, (Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner at night), Hanskin Essence, Peach and Lily Good Acids Copper Peptides Serum, Kiehl's ü•ë Eye Cream, and the COSRX Moisturizer  as my final skincare step. I like how light it is, the price point, the volume of product, the consistency, & how long the bottle lasts. Its travel - friendly and good for all skin types. * This moisturizer is great for the summer or daytime, but personally its too lightweight for my combo skin. Its more hydrating than moisturizing and has a gel like texture. I gave it to my roommate who has oily skin and she loves it * It has helped me a lot with managing my breakouts along with clarifying toner. They really are a great combo to use. All the ingredients are clean and i havent had any type of allergic reaction. Ive scanned it the bottle for acnegenic and condemenic ingredients and it had none and then i also scanned it for toxins and it had none. Overall i would recommend to anyone unless they're specifically looking for a matteifying moisturizer. This oil free moisturizer gives you a slight sheen and glow. * New favorite! This has been amazing for my combo skin. My skin stays hydrated all day long but doesn't get oily. Great as a base layer under make-up, doesn't pill. * lightweight moisturizer , made skin smooth  , I Don't Think this moisturizer won't break you out !!! * i love this moisturizer, its perfect for layering! especially for skincare routines & when applying spf and makeup"

253,kinship,supermello hyaluronic gel cream,pimprod2017767,2569973," * Seriously, the greatest of all time. I have dry, sensitive skin that's prone to rosacea and this has been a life saver. It's gentle and leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and soothed. It's an added bonus that it smells delicious. * This is a great product for my dry, sensitive, and maturing skin. I more than likely will not purchase again. Bought 3 times before yall went and raised the price by $14. Not worth the price IMO. I feel there are better products for that price point. * I got this to keep my face from getting dry this winter. It works very well so far. The only thing I question is the fragrance, which is delightful, but probably not so good for my skin. * I wanted to love this product! The smell/texture is lovely.

Unfortunately, while sporting a ""clean ingredients"" tag and a tag from the national eczema association, I found the product to be highly irritating when I had a flare up. I only used it once during that time, and then after taking a second look at the ingredients, I found out that ""phenoxyethanol"" is a known potential allergen, irritant, potential endocrine disruptor, and the manufacturing process is highly polluting. In other countries the ""safe"" threshold for this ingredient is 1%, but it's hard to determine how much one is exposed to if applying daily/multiple times a day. Of course, there is no such regulation in US, so who knows how much is in this cream. 

At the same time I bought this, I tried products from cocokind which I highly recommend! They have a great price point and really are ""clean"" from what I have used so far, although one should always do their own research. While I was still having an eczema episode, I found using a homemade oatmeal paste + cocokind's chia seed oil was very helpful to get me through the dry itchiness. 

TLDR: not a clean product, could be irritating, check out cocokind. * I've been being treated for cancer for about a year and a half, now. Almost 6 months of that has been chemotherapy. Most products cause acne and rashes on my skin, since being on treatment. 
Pros: Did not irritate my overly sensitive skin. Smells good. I don't understand all the complaints about the smell. It is light and nice. It is kind of like marshmallows, but better. 

Cons: it moisturizes, but not enough while going through chemo. It feels great when I first put it on. But, after a few hours my skin feels tight again. Kind of like how vaseline can trick you into thinking your skin is moisturized at first. Hours later the surface of your skin feels tight and dry like a sunburn ready to peel. 

For the price, thete are much better options. Philosophy moisturizers are a lottle cheaper and give better longer lasting results for me in terms of moisture. * This is my 3rd time repurchasing this moisturizer.

After 24 hours, it still feel super soft. It doesn't make my face feel lumpy or greasy as other moisturizers. 

It does have a light smell, but it isn't a huge disgust. It's kinda like a earthy or clayish smell to me. * Osea's website markets this as being for all skin types, so I tried it. I always thought I was oily/combo skin and wanted a less greasy look so I went for this.

Turns out, either my skin may have been the dry type (this product dried it). Its hard to say. It wasnt very moisturizing and I'd say more dehydrating, as my forehead developed dehydration lines and skin overall looked dull/aged. 

Id been using a different product brand religiously for years before switching and never had any dullness, no dry skin, always bright and wrinkle free, hydrated and clear. Ultimately switched back. * Osea is my favorite skincsre brand! This is literally the  only product ive tried i'm not in love with. It is hydrating yes, but it feels heavy on my skin and takes a while to absorb. While i dont hate it, i like my moisturizer to feel light and refreshing, so i wont be getting this again * This cream feels nice on the skin at first and has no discernable fragrance. Over time it started to sting my skin, caused the worst break out I've ever had and made my skin red and puffy. I have no allergies. * It's a gear product, I just wish it came in a 2.0 Ounce pump bottle like the atmosphere protection cream! * This is a lovely cream, it feels light on my skin.

I've tried a lot of SPF and finally found one that doesn't leave me ultra shiny and oily.  I really like this product and will keep using it! Only downside is that I think some of the oils in the product settled and the last couple of uses did leave my skin somewhat shiny but other than that, my skin was left soft and even toned! * Contains harmful chemicals that damage our coral reefs.

I have normal skin and I really love this product. * I'm in my 30's and have always had acne prone, oily skin. A few years ago, I was able to clear up my skin with a strict morning and night routine that includes prescription creams, but every time I would try using SPF, I would immediately break out. I've tried dozens of prestige and drugstore brands! This moisturizer with SPF is the first that hasnt caused a single breakout. I've been using it for over a month now and I will continue to as long as its on shelves. * This product is okay as a moisturizer and sunscreen but leaves you shiny looking. It also does not work well under makeup at all. I learned the hard way after I was almost completely done with my makeup and it began lifting and leaving ugly peeling patches when i used a powder brush. For the price, theres way better sunscreens out there. The murad sunscreen in a blue bottle is about the same size and the same price but works amazing. * I switched to this sunscreen and my pores and oily skin were controlled also my skin felt amazing!

I will definitely keep this in my beauty routine * I mean it...when I say I am nearly 30 and struggled with hormonal skin since I was 12..I have spent SO much money on skincare products, it's insane. Recently I bought a $150 moisturizer claiming it was magic, when THIS..PUR Cloud Cream (for a fraction of the price)..was all I've ever wanted and needed. It is the silkiest product and it just melts into the skin like a drink for your pores. I mix it with a dab of Charlotte Tilbury ""beautiful skin"" foundation and I feel like a million bucks. Immediate confidence boost. It's just enough tint to perfect the redness from my acne and scars...and it leaves the most gorgeous finish, like I just got back from the medspa and my skin is plump, hydrated, and GLOWING. I got this as a sample from Ulta and I had to come back here, buy the full size immediately, and leave a review. I knew nothing about it so when I searched it up I was expecting this to be much more expensive. A double win for it's attainable price!! Please never discontinue."

Best I've used so far. * Great product * I had started using the Bareminerals Skin Longevity line but didn't quite care for the daily moisturizer with sunscreen so I bought this product.  I am 60 yoa and have struggled with acne and skin problems since I was a teenager.  I believe it's mostly due to bad genes because my sisters and daughter also had acne problems. This moisturizer absorbs well, but because it is oil free, it doesn't leave my skin shiny or greasy looking. It makes my skin feel fresh and smooth. I do not look my age and I believe that using these Baremineral products contribute to my better looking skin. * I use this daily after cleansing. It is light-weight but easily covers my face & neck. It isn't oily at all. I have used other products in the past. They cause breakouts and leave my face feeling greasy all day or soak in immediately & don't create a good foundation. * Best moisture I have ever used. A little goes a long ways.

Using the whole set it's very expensive but if you are careful and use them as indicated they last.  I bought mine on October 2022 and run out of them in February 2023 bravo!!!

Then on my way back I travel to Mexico so I took all the bottles because I was going to stay there 3 months. Then my set got finished there   I checked in the fine stores in Mexico but there were no Refills so I had to I'm wait till I return to USA to buy them. I'm strongly recommending the Lanc√¥me Absolute products they all wonderful! Use them carefully and daily! * I love this product, and I've tried quite a few high end moisturizers. I'm 52 a post menopausal. I only gave it 4* because of the price, and the fragrance.  Most over the age of 50 will likely remember a bottle of White Shoulders sitting on their grandmother or mother's vanity, and that's what the smell of this cream reminds me of. Very floral and not just roses. I can live with the price, but I would definitely give it 5* if Lanc√¥me would make a fragrance free version. The fragrance doesn't linger, but the smell reminds me of what old women smelled like when I was a child."

The product is nicely presented but it just add a layer of products to my skin with no benefit and perhaps add to my dry skin issue. * I've used several Est√©e Lauder skincare, especially the Daywear moisturizer with SPF for 18 years. I have combination/oily skin and as much as I loved the products I always struggled with oiliness. I decided to take a break a couple years and I regret it. My skin has significantly changed and not for the better. I tried so many new products and nothing compared. I came back to Estee Lauder and decided to try this Nutritious line, and I absolutely love it!!! This one does not make me oily or shiny and I love the way my Estee Lauder foundation sits on my skin. I will say I bought a whole regime and I'm using the Nutritious essence and moisturizer, and the Perfectionist serum and SPF. I got them on sale during Black Friday sales recently and I couldn't be happier. I can say this moisturizer is making all the difference for me. * Not for me feels to heavy * I have quite dry skin and this product just doesnt work with my skin type. Makes my face look and feel dehydrated. I can maybe understand why this would work for oily folks but not enough for dry skin. * I got this creme in the Glow kit. When I cleanse my face, I apply it as a standalone and immediately see my face turn red. I have sensitive skin, plus large pores. :( * I don't see the hype. Texture of cream felt like light face lotion and went on just the same. I've used it twice as an over night mask and I woke up with dry skin. My Elemis night cream is 5x more nourishing than this ""face mask"" cream. * I live in the Arctic and the cold sucks any moisture out of my skin. I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts from moisturizers and new products. Basically if you touch it, it's going to have issues. I received a sample of this with my last makeup order and this stuff is amazing! I have been using it as my daily moisturizer and my skin is soft, hydrated, and most of all clear!

So purchase if they have original * In my constant quest for skincare products that deliver real results, I recently tried the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid. This lotion claims to gently exfoliate, boost cell turnover, and provide deep hydration to uncover softer, smoother skin. Let's dive into my experience with this multi-tasking formula.

The lotion is non-greasy and lightweight, making it perfect for daily use. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and hydrated without any heavy residue. The product is fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for those with sensitive skin or a sensitivity to strong scents. The natural smell from the lactic acid salts is subtle and varies slightly depending on your skin's unique pH, but it's not overpowering or unpleasant. * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is revolutionary! It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body."

It is kinda crazy because I've been using Bare Minerals makeup for 25+ years and never considered the skin care products. On impulse, I picked this up and I'm really glad I did. My skin is really happy. In two weeks it has reduced redness, dryness, and you can't see the lines on my forehead anymore. So if you want results without all the harsh chemicals this is the cream for you. * Been using this for a couple of years. This product usually lasts me 5 months. Am glad for that! * I love how it feels as I am applying it. It feels wonderfully soft and smooth. Will be purchaching more! Love It! * My skin was looking dull and dreary. I love bare minerals powder foundation, so thought I'd try their skin care. The ageless line is lovely, leave my skin clear, bright and smooth.

Yes, it does pill if it is not the last step in your routine. It is my 2nd to last step, and depending on how long I wait to apply the oil afterwards, affects how intensely the moisturizer pills. The moisture and effectiveness is worth it though. If I can't give a good 10 minutes before applying oil, then I will just skip the oil that night. * Biggest disappointment from Ulta so far‚Ä¶ not moisturizing‚Ä¶ for some reason it dehydrates my skin‚Ä¶ dont waste your $$$ * This works great! A little goes a very long way. It's very moisturizer yet not oily. I love this night cream. * Doesn't absorb into the skin as quickly as I would like, but once it is, my face and neck are so bright and refreshed. * Keep The Phenoxyethanol out of products please! 
If Europe can ban Endocrine disruptors why cant we. 
This is like the only ""clean brand"" in the states. So dissapponting.. * I have combo acne prone skin for reference. 
This is like a light watery lotion but absorbs like a rich cream. It soaks right in and paces a velvety, supple feeling that I love. Sometimes my skin is drier so I could see me being able to use this during the day also without being too heavy. It does have a scent. It's like candy strawberry and flowers. It's light and goes away very shortly. You only need a little of this because it spreads so well. It can be easy to go overboard. I think this is definitely worth the money given the ingredients, packaging and how long this will last. Especially compared to other creams. I don't breakout but wake up with super soft, nourished skin. * I want to love this product so badly but the fragrance/essential oils in this caused my eczema to flare up. I'm so sad but I know it's on me for buying something with fragrance, natural or not. Otherwise I think it's a nice product it wasn't drying or anything and the texture is really nice just wish they had a fragrance free version. I will stick with the vegan ceremide cream"

This hit the spot. It does feel more like a sunscreen due to the texture and smell, but it also gives a moisturized feeling after your am routine and doesn't feel drying. I don't often leave reviews, but as I am about to purchase my 3rd tube, I thought it was worthy! * I've been using this sunscreen for monyhs now. Im on my 4th bottle and I absolutely love it! I have extremely oily skin that's very sensitive. This product not only goes on like a dream and absorbs quickly(which is great for my inpatient rushes lol.) But it also helps mattify under primer and control my oily skin a bit. Now does it completely stop oil breakthroughs No! But lets be real there isn't a single matte or oil free product that will. It takes a routine and work if your skin is like mine. But now I'm being recommended to use physical(mineral) sunscreen due to my melasma. I'm struggling to find one that will work for my skin type and hating letting this one go! Highly recommend this product if you want a good matte, sheer, daily sunscreen. * I have been enjoying this! I have been using it for 2 months now. I'm always on the hunt for a good SPF/moisturizer duo just because I am trying not to add more steps to my skincare routine. Often times, at least with cheaper ones, they leave my face very shiny. Even after hours of wearing this one, I don't see my skin very greasy at all! It's worth a try, especially for this price point! * It goes on smooth and feels great. Unfortunately, the smell is so strong and unpleasant. I scrubbed my face twice after using and it's still awful. * I was advised to use this by my esthetician.  I have been using thos for a while now and i really like it. I have oily skin and i like thst it has SPF in it. I need to use items with SPF already in it, or ill forget. * After reading all the promises I thought this SPF would be perfect, but like other reviews mention this doesnt dry matte at all and I need to use a powder after applying. For the high price this should do what it says. Sounds like there was some sort of change in the formula that ruined it. * This was recommended by my esthetician. And it works well for me. I like that it has sun screen in it and it doesnt seem to make my face oily at all. It works for me."

Cleanser feels clean w/o stripping. The extolment stings and works! The moisturizer also stings a bit but feels great on! Sensitive skin beware. * This is a great deal! Yes, the one product is smaller than they said in the details, but all of these still last a long time. The face wash has a really nice light citrus smell. I havent used the moisturizer yet because I couldnt read what it was exactly or when to use it (before looking it up) because the white writing on the transparent container was impossible to read on top of being partially rubbed off.

I am combo blemish prone I have had no issues with breaking out. This makes my skin feel so smooth and hydrated. I use retinol and I have found that this is gentle enough to use with most exfoliating products. I love it so much I am on my third bottle. * I use this toner in combination with a 2% BHA exfoliant and a gel moisturizer from FAB & my skin is arguably the best it's been in years. Its soft, glowy, and I only experience maybe one hormone related pimple a month.  Makeup also looks way smoother now. This toner smells so good & you only need a little, i'vs been using it daily since March and i'm not even half way through the bottle. Highly recommend. * wanted to love it but its breaking me out. I have sensitive oily acne prone skin for reference. * I have very sensitive, dry, acne prone skin, and this toner has been amazing. I use it in combination with other toners and serums, one of which includes a different type of active and I was worried at first that combining them would irritate my skin but this did the exact opposite. I had no purging, and my skin has been glowy, bright, and hydrated, days since the start of using this product. Its been nearly a month of twice daily use and the results seem to keep getting better and better. Im eager to try more products from this brand bc my skin loves it. * It leaves my aging skin slightly dewy and fresh feeling.  I use it as my moisturizer on days i dont need a heavier product and after toner, before moisturizer on more dry days. * I read nothing but rave reviews for this product and was excited to give it a try when my previous milky toner ran out. Unfortunately it really damaged my skin barrier and caused a lot of irritation and acne. I neglected to see that it contains niacinimide, which i am sensitive to.

I noticed new packaging at some point but thought it was the same product because it didnt say it wasnt. It did its job as an every day  sun screen, moisturized and worked well under makeup. The last  two bottles purchased have had a weird and unpleasant texture with random teeny tiny and sharp! little crystals that are invisible but feel awful on the skin. Really bad...! The first bottle with this issue I  thought was just a fluke...bad batch  or expired. Also I noticed some pilling with make up but not all the time. I thought it might be another product causing the pilling. Now with the 2nd, current and last bottle the same way I will not be repurchasing. It's expensive (for me) so I will finish the current bottle but it's frustrating to have to find something else that works as well as the origional version. * somehow gives me cold sores? havent had them since childhood but the moment i started using this, they came back--never again. the new formula is awful, never buy it. * This lotion with spf is my new favorite! It goes on smooth and isn't greasy. My skin feels hydrated, and I have a dark spot that has gotten significantly lighter. I highly recommend this lotion! 

Aveeno, please don't change this formula ever!! * I am happy this product does not dry out my skin, but I don't feel it will protect my face from sunburn.  That being said, my face was peeling because of the high strength of my lotion. At least it is now not peeling. * The moisturizer did help with my overall skin/was a decent moisturizer, but the pilling is/was so bad, almost constant, even hours after application. It also doesn't sit well under any make-up, even a just light skin tint. The smell is strong, but it honestly just smells like soap so that wasn't an issue for me and I kind of liked it. * This product is light and smells good.  I love that it has SPF. * I've used it for over 10 years. There's been changes with it over the years, but my skin soaks it up like a sponge and leaves me glowing."

So disappointing. * Smooth, spreads evenly, makes my skin feel divine!  I LOVE that it is not at all oily!!! * Goes on so easy, smooth great moisturizer with a real light tempt * I first bought it and loved it. It made my skin look so good and was the perfect amount of coverage for a no make up feel and look. I started having problems though with it pilling. I tried letting my moisturizer sit for awhile before applying, and even just applying this alone, but it still pills really badly. I kept using it due to the glow and feel, but then started having eye issues. I a stye on my right lid, followed by two other ones on my left eye. They were so bad I had to get eyedrops to heal them. This is the only new product I had introduced, and it did at times burn my eyes when I was sweating while wearing the product. I love a lot of PTR products, but this one just isn't worth it in my opinion. * This is so soft and light weight. I have very fair sensitive skin that burns easy. I use this everyday that I want a no makeup, makeup look. The sun screen works well and my face feels so soft and hydrated when on. I was worried about it being too dark but once on it blends so naturally. This will be used for years to come. * I  got this PTR spf to replace the mineral tinted spf 45 that I LOVE and used for years. I cannot believe that Ulta discontinued one of the BEST tinted high spfs on the market. Skin looked amazing and I received a lot of compliments and everyone who tried it loved it as was evident by the reviews.

This chemical based spf does not look or feel as good but more importantly the chemical version is not good for melasma.  Also the mineral spf 45 had somewhat decent COVERAGE. You could just add a tinted powder and skin look flawless.

In my opinion there are SO many great moisturizers out there that out perform this and are cheaper. * Bought this because I like the day cream version a lot.  This however was just not a great formulation for me.  It simply NEVER absorbs into my skin and then it just rubs off on my pillow case or hands eventually.   And I don't use an excessive amount because of the price tag.  I'm a big fan of using the minimal amount required.  It's too late to return it, so it's just going to move into my graveyard of products that I can't bare to throw away because, $$$, but just don't work on my skin.  Le sigh.

Absolutely not worth the price point. There are more hydrating options out there. * I have dry, sensitive skin & this cream has been a game changer for my skin. I love that this balm doesn't have shea butter like most balms because i suffer from acne & cannot use that ingredient on skin. This cream has cleared my acne (i assume because it has salicylic acid) & my skin just looks & feels so much healthier.

283,beautybio,the quench rapid recovery face cream,pimprod2019383,2572410, * I can't believe I'm writing this review because who has the time but when something works this good you need to share your experience. My 33 year old skin looks phenomenal! It's so moisturizing and soft on my skin with a beautiful glow. * Easily the BEST anti-aging deeply hydrating moisturizer I've ever used!!!! I've not only purchased the entire live for myself but family members and it's worth every penny. A LITTLE goes a long way! * The best face cream I have ever used. * This face cream was so expensive and I felt it didn't work for me. It made my face very sensitive and my foundation didn't stay well on top it. I was disappointed but will try something new. * I am loving the results of these products. * I've tried MANY MANY moisturizers. this one is THE BEST hands down! Use it day 1 and your face feels like a babys butt the very next day. That's how fast and amazing this stuff works. Nothing will make your skins feel this soft and supple. And no breakouts! (a few moisturizers make me break out for some reason but not this) The only downside is the price; it's horrendously expensive so I hafta wait until my bday & xmas gift cards and rewards points to buy it so I only buy it about once a year. A little goes along way so I can make it last a few months. I'm 56 with normal to dry skin. * I have used it for a week now. Like the way my skin feels I use it at night. Packaging is a little over the top. Contents is a lot smaller than it appears from the outside.
284,no7,hydraluminous+ hydrating day gel,pimprod2043213,2620549, * Great moisturizer for the winter months. * this product was somehow too much and nit enough all at once. I felt dry and somehow more clogged than normal. I am thankful for ultas return policy.
285,buttah skin,cocoshea revitalizing cream,pimprod2025807,2585286," * Was in love with this moisturizer and have repurchased several times. New formula broke me out insanely bad :( Go back to the old formula pleeeaaase!!! * I used this product religiously for the past 2 years and recently I noticed the product would be out of stock for a month or 2 and I see why now!! The formula was changed. Im soooo upset! It used to be so thick and creamy.. I looked like a glazed donut and product wouldnt absorb so quickly (which I prefer since I have dry skin) and now its a gel like cream and absorbs quickly. I still had the old packaging and compared ingredients and YUP it changed. It started breaking me out and started having little bumps on my forehead. I give it a 2 at least since I know people with oily skin would benefit from this more and love it as much as I did! * I feared this would be too oily and thick for my oil-prone skin. However, it rubs in and absorbs well. It has also contributed to fading my acne scars. I highly recommend this for people who want to even out their skin tone and fade dark spots. * I love this moisturizer! It coats my skin well and it is perfect for the winter and not too heavy in the summer. It can give you a slight sheen in the summer if it's really hot. Otherwise, it definitely moisturizes the skin and last all day for me. It also gives a good slip when applying sunscreen. * I had been using the CocoShea Revitalizing cream for about 2 years. I have extremely dry skin and this was my go to moisturizer. I loved that the shea butter was the second ingredient in the label. The formula was changed. It's not as moisturizing as the old formula. I guess I'll be on the hunt for another rich moisturizer. How disappointing. * It looks like it's heavy and greasy but its not, its light. A little goes a long way, this stuff saved my skin during the winter season. Its become a daily fixture in my skincare and makeup routine. Itmakes my skin feel so soft, I absolutely love it!!! * What I like about this cream, it's not to heavy but it's not to light either,  My skin loves it and I have normal to dry skin type,  Thank you Buttah!"

I wanted to try something new and saw good reviews for this product so I gave it a try and truly wish I hadn't. This moisturizer is heavy and sticky. It leaves my skin feeling‚Ä¶. just gross. It made my skin break out in these weird tiny bumps and caused an acne flare up. I would not recommend this product. * this is a very nice moisturizer BUT it pills horribly. it messes up the makeup i put on top of it everytime. no matter how much i rubbed it in. will be returned. * Melts onto my skin. Doesn't feel heavy * As someone who struggles with rosacea, its hard to find skincare I like. This moisturizes, calms, and makes my skin feel soft and supple without making it feel greasy.

After multiple uses, I can confidently say that this product does nothing for me (literally). My skin feels no different when I put it on, and I haven't noticed it making my makeup look better or last longer compared to not wearing a primer at all. The cooling effect makes it not for use around the eyes, but that's exactly where I need my primer to focus on my concealer. Disappointed that NYX traded their Angel Veil shelf space for this product line‚Ä¶ definitely not worth the price tag! * I really found this primer to be cooling soothing, and just overall a very good quality product before applying foundation. I would definitely buy it again. * Would not buy  this again..reminded me of that menthol bio freeze cream that's been water down about 90 percent..its aweful..it took forever to stop that feeling..and it made my eyes burn..even though I didn't put on eyes.. * I'm obsessed with this product.  The texture is like nothing I've ever felt.  It's somehow soft and fluffy/bouncy feeling but oh so cooling and hydrating on the skin.  I love it so much and use daily.  Will definitely repurchase! * Use daily * Great moisturizer/primary. I just put a serum on and then use this. It goes on smooth and lasts all day with no oil even though i have combo oily skin.

Sometimes my skin fees a litte dry when its a dry day. I love how this also acts like a primer, my makeup stays on really well when I use this. * I got this wanting a moisturizer with spf since I have tinted moisturizer for makeup. This was not what I was hoping it would be. It was really sticky and it didn't really feel like moisturizer. I ended up returning. * I have very sensitive dry skin, I've been searching for over a year for the perfect mineral sunscreen that doesn't cause acne or dry me out, I think I've finally found it!!! it can feel greasy when you first put it on but quickly absorbs. I reapply throughout the day, and honestly LOVE this product. it's so amazing. I bought it on a whim thinking I would end up hating it too like all the others I've tried, but I believe I found my sunscreen!!! I've been using it for almost 3 weeks multiple times throughout the day!! * I love this sunscreen because of the high Zinc Oxide for UBA/UVA rays and the ingredients make me glow! It absorbs pretty quickly and you won't feel oily as the day goes on. No eye irritation. It does reflect the sun light away from your skin. * 100% my favorite ever. Yuka has it wrong I looked up the ingredients myself and this one is my favorite. * Horrible product it gave me a rash. Supper greasy and leaves a white cast. Waist of money"

I have redness/combination  and sensitive skin and not only did it help with my redness but my skin immediately absorbed it and at no point did i feel oily. A must have! * Best moisturizer I've used and I've used many.  A little goes a long way. * Ive been using this product for about a year now (i think) maybe a few months less than that.. I do like it, I can feel how it seems to be tightening my skin.. But, i havent noticed any difference. I have noticed at the very top where my hair line is, it gets super dry. I am not sure if it is the moisturizer or what but i have tried several different shampoos and conditioners and still have the problem. But i havent tried a different moisturizer yet. The smell does not bother me, it does smell good. I do feel like it isn't as moisturizing as it should be though‚Ä¶ I really wish I could find the old Chanel Hydra Micro Creme! 

Honestly, I believe this moisturizer just depends on your skin type. I use it with my Chanel foundation.. I am still iffy about it because I feel like it also shows my ""fine lines"" more but I am not very good with all of this anyway. Lol * I unfortunately have sensitive skin, I find the fragrance to be irritating on me. Plus I have a bit of a break out coming in from hormones. I've been trying it for a while, I really wanted to love it. * Best product ever. * The No 1 Chanel line is phenomenal. I have 3 products now and will continue to add more. This is just what my ""mature"" skin needed. 
Thank you Katarina‚Ä¶Chanel and Ulta are lucky to have such a professional, knowledgeable and kind associate! * I got this as a sample and I immediately bought it once it ran out. I live in the desert so my skin gets really dry with the weather here, this moisturizer has been the only thing that's been able to hydrate my skin without leaving it greasy and my pores look like they're getting smaller. I'm pretty selective when it comes to spending money but this was well worth it."

Only thing is kinda pricey but what isnt * This with the Tula Glowscreen.. üëçüèºüëçüèº
GAME CHANGING * It burns and apparently I'm not alone. I don't have very sensitive skin. This immediately made my face hot and stingy. Then the oil production kicked up. This is not wearable for me. * I mix this with my sunscreen and foundation. It gives a subtle glow and a bit  of moisture. For reference I have oily skin and ive had no issues incorporating into my makeup routine. * I've tried their regular moisturizer before & I loved it. However, this makes me feel like my skin is burning when I put it on. it's not too moisturing either. * Have used GLAMGLO and it is no longer available. So, I did some research and started to use ELEMIS. I guess it's ok except for the bottle it comes in, terrible. Very hard to come out, I ended up cutting it open and put the contents in a jar.

Not sure I would purchase this at full price though * My skin looks and feels softer& smoother with this cream. I love the light citrus scent! The dispenser is also great for avoiding contamination and spoilage of product. I also use it on the backs of my hands to hopefully discourage age spots down the road. * I do not have 'sensitive skin' type and yet this severly dried out my skin and it felt painful like a sunburn. I gave it a few tries I thought my skin was drying out because of the cooler weather but nope, this was the culprit! I cannot even fathom paying full price for this product. * I dont like the scent. It smells good when you're putting it on, but then it makes your pillow smell like wet dog. This dried out my face horribly and created big dry patches under my eyes and above my eyelids. I have to return it. * My skin is extremely sensitive to new products, especially retinols. This took a few weeks to get used to, but I'm now using it almost every night. My skin has SO much more life to it! * I recently switched my skincare line from Lanc√¥me to Kate Somerville and let me just say that my face hasn't looked or felt this good in years. I have seen more results in only a few short weeks than I ever did with Lanc√¥me. AND this line is less expensive. It's a win win! * For the first two weeks, everything was fine. Last night, I put it on and it literally burnt the skin off around my eyes. I love the smell and feel of it, but I please be careful if you aren't used to using retinol.

I have sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate it or have a weird scent. * This Moisturizer was perfect for me in the weather ( Purchased in March 2025). This summer, every time I used it, within 1-2 hours eyes are burning me ( I work in a room with no sound light). I will be going back to trader joe daily sunscreen. * I used to have patches of dark skin on my forehead and upper lip. I realized after a couple months of using this that my patches were fading. 
I've used this product for several years now and no longer have the dark patches. I will not go without this product. It provides fantastic sun protection as well. I spend a lot if time by the pool and rely on this for my face spf. It has worked wonderfully. * Great product, absorbs quickly, non greasy formula * This cream is not like my favorite‚Äî Lanc√¥me Renergie HPN 300, but ok. I tried it because the Lanc√¥me is getting very pricey. It's a bit thicker and has hardly any scent but doesn't have all the great ingredients like the Lanc√¥me. * I do recommend this product to my friends and families and anyone that I can * I have tried so many products for my dry skin from inexpensive to expensive.

I'm a skincare junkie and I try new moisturizers all the time, but I always come back to this. The texture is PERFECT. It's a lightweight gel-cream but still as deeply moisturizing as a rich cream. A lot of gel creams dry down to nothing after an hour or two but this stays a lonnnng time. I literally use it like a nighttime rich cream, that's how nourishing it is. I tried the new vitamin c cream from Olehenriksen but its not as good as this OG one. May they never ever discontinue or reformulate! * My skin never looked better since using this entire line * you have no idea how many moisturizers I tried in my life and this became in my top 3. omg the glow I get with this is unreal. i get so many compliments from people about my skin when I use it. it doesn't break me out, it actually helped me clear my skin ! i will buy this again and again and I hope they will not change the formula! * I went on a trip and only brought this moisturizer for face and body. I got a little sunburn and used this and the burn went away over night with no peeling. I will forever use this as my after sun lotion. Highly recommend. * After using this product once I woke up the next morning with severe redness and achne-like bumps over my entire face!! I wanted to itch my face off it was so bad. Once I removed the product my face started to calm down. My skin is never sensitive like this, but it did NOT like this product what-so-ever!! * I wouldn't say that I am a fan of any skincare product, I hope they just do their job. Nothing has floored me like this skincare line. I bought this moisturizer because I bought the eye cream a couple weeks ago and LOVED IT. I can actually feel these products working on my skin. I've been blessed with normal skin and I can actually feel the benefits of this product. I feel moisturized and my skin feels ""alive"". I would highly recommend. * Big fan of Ole Henriksen products. I've tried them all and while its hard to choose a favorite, this is my go-to. It smells great (like a fresh orange) and feels even better. My skin just looks younger and better."
298,amlactin,daily vitamin c lotion with 7% lactic acid aha,pimprod2043811,2623399," * I purchased this on a whim after reading about products known to help with KP, and it totally works!! It does have a clinical smell to it, but it goes away after a few minutes.

I get bumps and rough texture on my upper arms, thighs, back, and butt and have used this product in all places. I use a body scrubber in the shower and use this lotion on damp skin immediately after getting out.

I have noticed a massive difference on my arms-- they are nearly perfectly smooth, with the odd clogged pore every so often. While the rest of my skin has seen improvement, it has not been nearly as effective as on my arms-- I think this may be related to my ability to actually exfoliate those areas effectively. I am plus sized, so those areas of my body are just softer. I think if I were to use a scrubber that gave me more leverage and then applied this, I would see even more of a difference. * This stuff works! I get dry, scaly, red patches on my shins and the backs of my arms in the winter, and this is the ONLY thing I have found that helps. Seriously after two days the scaling on my arms was GONE! The patches on my legs are taking a little longer but it is improving every day, and the redness is fading.
It doesn't smell very nice. I know it's because they don't add any artificial fragrance and what you are smelling is the natural scent of the active ingredients. To get around that I mix it with some scented dry body oil.
I will keep using this! Bring it on, high-elevation dry winter climate, I found your match! * Purchased based on 5 star reviews but it smells like self tanner. I can not get passed the smell at all. it does feel very hydrating even after first use. * As a beauty enthusiast always on the lookout for products that truly make a difference, I was excited to try the AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid. This lotion promises a lot‚Äîgentle exfoliation, brightening effects, and hydration‚Äîall while being safe for sensitive and acne-prone skin. 

By the end of the week, my skin looked more even-toned, and some of my dark spots had started to fade. The gentle exfoliation from the lactic acid helped in renewing my skin without causing any irritation or redness‚Äîa common issue I face with more aggressive exfoliants. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid exceeded my expectations! This dynamic blend of lactic acid and vitamin C not only brightens my complexion but also gently exfoliates. My skin feels smoother and looks more radiant. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula makes it ideal for use under makeup. This lotion has swiftly become one of my top choices for achieving a glowing, healthy appearance. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C is perfect for my normal to dry skin. It also brightens and evens out my skin. I love to apply it when my legs are out for a natural glow! * Looking for bright and radiant skin? Look no further! The lightweight moisturizing lotion contains 7% lactic acid for gentle exfoliation and Vitamin C for skin that will look glowy and fresh! My skin looks smoother and softer after just a few days!"

I had to wash it off. Returned it to the store. This one is not for me but Olay doesn't make it easy to know which one of their products to use. * I purchased this moisturizer from Ulta and it arrived within a few days. I use the product both morning and evening even if I am supposed to only use it once a day. My skin appears brighter and it is definitely smoother. I even use it on my neck but so far I haven't noticed a difference there. * This smooths my face and doesn't cause breakouts which so many moisturizers do. I haven't found a moisturizer yet that doesn't break me out. It lasts all day and works well underneath your makeup or by itself. I definitely plan on continuing to use this. * A couple months back I went on vacation to the Bahamas where my skin ended up breaking out very badly.  I brought this moisturizer with. It felt like my face was burning off and every time I took a shower more skin peeled off my face. It was the most miserable time ever. I assumed it had something to do with the trip. A couple days ago I tried this product again, the next morning the same thing happened, immediately this time. My face is burning, feels hot to the touch, bright red and is breaking out with little bumps all over and starting to do that gross oozy thing again. Now I realize it's this moisturizer. It might be awesome on some, just not me. I really wanted to like this product but I wouldn't wish this horrible reaction on anybody. So I guess just be cautious and if you notice something doesn't feel right, stop using it immediately. * This stuff isnt just great for your face, but can work on other sensitive areas too. I had dark marks/hyperpigmentation left behind from a medical adhesive left on my thigh too long, and this genuinely helped to fade those lines to a point where they are less noticeable * I love the way this smells. I use it in the mornings, a little hint of citrus smell is nice to give you a little wake up. Goes on a little sticky, but drys smooth and soft. Definitely recommend."

It truly makes my face feel soft and look better than ever with makeup, I don't look cakey. I use this with a water-based mac foundation and set with a charlotte tilburry powder. * 1st time I purchased this.  Great for Arizona summers. * Nice light not too heavy. Light scent. Does not irritate my sensitive skin. Calming. Definitely a favorite face cream. * I bought this and absolutely love it!! I will definitely buy it again!! * I have acne rosacea along with endometriosis, so my skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and breakouts so easily. I have tried every moisturizer from the drugstore to my dermatologist prescriptions, and nothing, I mean nothing has compared to this. this has not made my face itch, burn, or breakout. it actually took away about 90% of my redness in the first 24 hours i used it. i never thought Chanel would be my life line, but its now my holy grail. if you are truly sensitive, and not just ""sensitive"" like the majority of women say and they use like Cerave on their skin, but seriously have sensitive skin, try this out. you wont be disappointed. id rather pay more for quality ingredients than anything from a drugstore."

No aloe listed, but definitely not the moisturizing I need. Just another expensive product to put in the pile of products I have paid for that I can't use. * Yes, I know the packaging isn't sexy or exciting. And no, this product probably isn't trending on Tiktok at the moment. However, this is one of the absolute best and most luxurious face creams I've ever used, and at a desirable price point. It leaves my cracked, painful and psoriasis-prone face plump, dewy, glowy and hydrated for the entire day or night. It performs better than the majority of my high end brand creams do and is extremely gentle. Highly recommend trying. * It moisturizes my skin too much! It looks great under makeup, you wake up as if you had just washed your face, I love it! Super moisturizing. * I am of the darker persuasion in her late 30s and it is hard to find a moisturizer that does not over power you with the smell. But this, this one is lovely. It goes on like butter ladies. Trust me it blends well with other products too. * This cream smells like the airplane cabin bathroom pink hand soap, which is slightly offputting. It also feels thick and heavy without seeming to sufficiently moisturize my face, so I think this formula just isn't for me."

It leaves a beautiful glow and deeply hydrates but again, not for oily skin or if you leave in hot weather.Too heavy for a day cream * I got this product with high hopes. It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy. I don't like the packaging, but i've noticed a lot of brands going this route so its whatever. I would recommend it though."

I was blown away by how effective this max hydration cream by ROC is! When you first apply this you can feel it deeply hydrating your skin. It's fast absorbing and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. After about a week of use i started to notice a slight reduction of my visible fine lines and wrinkles. After about 3 weeks to a month of use I have much firmer skin. This cream is amazing! 
Contains Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol for maximum results. Dermatologist tested. Paraben free. Non comedogenic. Non irritating and fragrance free. 
I received this product free from Roc & PinchMe. * So gar I'm enjoying the  line smoothing max hydration cream. It's a bit thicker than I anticipated but it's creamy enough the it goes on smooth. After just a few days I noticed how hydrated my skin feels. I can't wait to see what the future holds in continuing this product.  Because I sure need it. Retinol these lines honey.. retinol these lines lol. Thanks ulta"

Im normal to oily. * Works perfect for my skin type. Im normal to oily. * This is a thing that I searched for very light weight non sticky and effective * Put this moisturizer on and had to take it off within minutes bc the smell was giving me a headache. I dont Understand why skincare companies think they need to add such strong fragrance to their products. Will be returning this product. * I started using this about a month ago and I love it! So this will now be two of their skincare products I really like and does the job. And again, affordable! I use it in my morning routine and feels great! Goes on smooth and light weight. I would recommend! * I just bought this came home put it on and instantly got a headache from the strong perfume smell. It's like they dumped a whole bottle of floral old lady perfume in this moisturizer. I looked at the ingredients and it actually says perfume and that shouldn't be in a face moisturizer. Returning this immediately"
312,fresh,rose & hyaluronic acid lightweight moisturizer,pimprod2038854,2608278," * This moisturizer is lightweight but does have a bit of a tacky texture immediately after application. I use 2 pumps for my face and neck after the shower or after I've washed my face. The product is absorbed pretty quickly after. It's pretty much my only skincare product other than a face wash and sunscreen. My oily t-zone and dry cheeks have really balanced out with regular use of this. The scent is a light rose and not overpowering. * Lovely rose scent and did not activate my rosacea redness. Great for light daily moisture coverage use after cleansing. * I have acne but also dry skin and this product was a solution for good hydration without adding any oil on my face. VERY good for moisturizing before doing your makeup. I live in Boston but also part in Florida and this product does not fail me. * I really wanted to love this. It smells amazing, it goes on feeling really nice and moisturizing. a little goes a long way. But the dry down is where it gets bad. it feels tacky and sticky and a weird gritty feeling that i just can't get past. It's hard to really describe but i just know i do not like how my skin feels after using this. I can't decide if i want to return it immediately or give it a chance for a week. It was a lot of money to spend to not love a product i use twice a day. * There's something about this that just feels a little luxurious. I purchased this on a black Friday sale otherwise I don't think I would've spent the money. Now that I've used it I will definitely repurchase in the future, even at the regular cost because I think it is worth it. I have oily skin and most moisturizers leave my skin oily because they are just too thick and creamy. This moisturizer is very thin and watery and glides on your face very smoothly and doesn't leave me feeling oily. I'm also a big fan of the rose smell. * this product is incredible!so glowy and hydrating!! also feels so luxurious! * I love that it's not greasy. I have acne prone skin and it doesn't make me break out."
313,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial moisturizer spf 30,pimprod2002927,2536697," * A great product. * This may be a decent moisturizer for winter or indoor not sweating use. Do not use for outdoor activities. It will burn your eyes SO badly. I don't have sensitive eyes or skin but I was practically blind on a summer hike. Horrible! I expect more from a brand like this. * I do have to say I only just tried this product so I'm unsure if it will break me out in the future. However it feels lovely on my skin. Before I applied this product I had some slight dry patches on my skin and it noticeably reduced the dryness. It didn't leave any white cast on my skin (I do have very fair skin though) and it made my skin looks very dewy and glowing! I would definitely recommend this product :) * I really do not understand the bad reviews. This is a great moisturizer with SPF in it. I personally like an all in one product and with 4.2 ounces you get a good value for your money. Not only does this have great ingredients, it is hydrating, sinks into your skin very easily, doesn't leave a white cast, and does not make your eyes burn. My skin glows after applying and it also wears SO well under makeup!! I do not find this sunscreen to be greasy at all. It actually makes me less oily throughout the day compared to the other SPF moisturizer I was using previously. I was using the Cerave AM lotion but wasn't in love with it as it took a lot of TLC to blend in and made my makeup pill. I was recommended this product by a friend and I am so glad I bought this. For those concerned about fragrance I notice a very very slight sunscreen smell but it doesn't bother me and I am someone who is sensitive to scents. This is a chemical sunscreen so some people may be sensitive to that. I am someone who isn't. I prefer chemical sunscreens anyway because they usually do not leave a white cast and are more hydrating. Mineral sunscreens are always too drying for my skin and leave too much of a whitecast. * I love this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I just love how it applies and how moisturized my skin feels afterwards. * It's ok. Def more of a sunscreen feel. Doesn't leave a white cast but takes a while to soak in. I have to wait quite awhile before I can begin applying my makeup. Like a lot of Kiehl's products but won't buy this one again. * I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now and I swear by it. I put it on in the morning before applying my makeup and it works perfectly. I've found that some moisturizers make my foundation look kinda wonky, but my makeup goes on top of this one nicely. Also, I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this product. I'm never going back!"
314,cetaphil,hydrating moisturizing cream body moisturizer,pimprod2028655,2586929," * I am into very very dry skin. Its greasy n geavy when applied. A big Nooo * I had a compromised skin barrier and flaky skin and I used this as a final layer in my skincare to lock in moisture. I wish I would've started with this in the beginning of fall. Highly recommend for very dry skin. I didn't love the texture on my body but would highly recommend for the face at night. * Fixed my winter lizard skin. Will be buying again and again * I started using retinol months ago, and my skin was so irritated that I had to put moisturizer on every hour to not be in pain. My dermatologist gave me a sample of the Cetaphil cream and I love it. I repackage it in a squeeze bottle for easier application. * I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin and this moisturizer is great! It is truly frangrance free: no chemical smell, just completely neutral. It is not greasy and it absorbs quickly. I like that it's in a tub so there's no product wasted. * Love how it makes my skin soft . & helps my old skin with age spots & bruising * my sensitive skin gets dry over time and this helps it a lot. I am 10 years old and I live in Florida so this is a must-have"
315,la roche-posay,pure vitamin c anti-wrinkle firming moisturizing filler,pimprod2019700,2574392," * Not too greasy, perfect for combination skin. Helped minimize fine lines after minths of use . * Although I enjoy the smell, the bottle is manufactured so terribly that even the lightest pressure expels the cream outside and under the lid. It is already half way gone with only using it a half full of times because the lid does not lock and stay in place! Highly disappointed. * I need C10 now! * Vitamin C does wonders for your skin. I use this for daytime care in conjunction with the Redermic R in the evening. It's a great combo ! * I use Redermic C every morning as my moisturizer.  I put it on, let it stay on a few minutes to absorb, and then apply my foundation and other makeup. * I use for 1 year and my skin now looks better, my Dermatologist recommended it üëåüèº * I used to use Dr Perricone products which are great but pricey so I read about the LaRoche line and some have gotten rewards from New Beauty Magazine. I gave it a try and I am very happy with the results ! I use Redermic R every other night and the Redermic C everyday in the morning. My skin looks and feels the same as when I used Perricone products. It consistently delivers."

317,est√É¬©e lauder,revitalizing supreme+ bright power soft cr√É¬®me moisturizer,pimprod2030767,2591239," * Great for someone who wants to even their skin tone or correct dark spots. visibly brightens complexion * Huge fan of Revitalizing Supreme + Youth Power Creme so naturally i love this too! The idea that it helps to brighten the skin without Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) won me over. I find Vitamin C can be too aggressive on my skin. * I love this moisturizer! Its my favorite to use day in and day out. It has an extremely soft, lightweight texture so its great for daily, but also has so many brightening, moisturizing, and mild resurfacing properties, its also great for my evening regimen as well. Ive noticed a lot of my dark spots evening out, and my skins surface looking more ""glass"" like. The Vitamin C & Beautyberry in this work together so well to be brightening & moisturizing. This is definitely one of my HOLY GRAILS!! * I seen a significant difference in my dark spots with this product! * This cream is amazing! It even tone my skin and took care of the dark spots. I've been it regularly, and I love the feeling of smooth and find lines! * Love how my skin looks more even * I do not have sensitive skin and this product made me break out. I'm 56 and never had acne issues. I do not recommend this"
318,belif,aqua bomb brightening vitamin c cream,pimprod2043263,2619878," * First, the packaging is misleading for these lotions. The lotion inside is only as wide as the narrow part of the cap. Im not sure why they have this packaged like a big tub of lotion when its not. They should save the extra unnecessary packaging and also not have it be so misleading. 
The lotion itself isnt great - i have very slightly sensitive skin and this lotion makes my redness come out. Will not be repurchasing * belif has just never been a brand to let me down. I can't believe I had never tried this moisturizer though! It's so soft and pillowy and hydrates the skin beautifully. It sits so well under Makeup and has this soft but heavenly smell. I mean from the first try, thus knocked everything else out for me. I 1000%  recommend. * This moisturizer worked for my face and gave me a little glow. I am disappointed that it's not sold in stores anymore. * I'm VERY picky about moisturizers, and my skin tends to be slightly acne-prone but is also extremely dehydrated. I've used the Aqua Bomb from this brand and LOVED it, so the Vitamin C was a must-try. It has the silkiest texture, and absorbs beautifully into the skin while also leaving it looking and feeling plump and bouncy. I did notice that my post-acne marks cleared up much more quickly with this, and it didnt seem to exacerbate existing acne while providing me with deep hydrating through the winter months. If you are oily, this may not be for you, but for me it was a 10/10! * Smells like iced lemon sugar cookie. Feels veey light on the skin and not oily. * I was very excited to try out this product bc of hearing great things and hoping that it would help lighten hyperpigmentation that I have on my face but after using it for a few months it did absolutely nothing. Its very light wieght and gives you a glow. Just disappointed. * I love the fresh scent and feel of this lotion. I look forward to using this each morning."
319,panoxyl,am oil control moisturizer with broad spectrum spf 30 mineral sunscreen,pimprod2041857,2615401," * made me look like the walking dead the white cast was so bad. took about 15 -20 minutes to sink in my skin and did not sit well with my makeup. pilled throughout the day every time I wore it. you are probably thinking I used to much by this review but I use a pea size each on both my cheeks and forehead, and a pea sized amount total on my nose, chin and around my mouth. it's about . 25 of an ounce. * I never leave reviews but I was really disappointed in this product. It had a white cast, peeled off my skin, didnt help with oil control, and made me break out. * i like this product but I dont like it enough to repurchase. While this product works very well to control oip it works a bit too well and by that I mean that it drys the crap out of my face. Like drier than the desert. and the white cast is something!! I go to blend in the products and you need some elbow grease to get it to blend in. if you sweat the products turns white on your face. * This broke me out and didnt control oil * Loved this sunscreen. I was searching high and low for a matte finish, mineral sunscreen and this is it. Great for oily skin. It does leave a slight white cast but dissipates. I was surprised by the bad reviews. You need to let it set first (wait ~10 minutes) before adding additional product (like makeup) on top. * This product would get 5 stars if it didn't smell like I shoved my face into a vase of Easter lilies. It absorbs quickly, doesn't feel heavy, and is only slightly tacky for a few minutes after application. * I bought this after seeing recommendations online. I get very oily on my tzone so i wanted to try this out. First, its very heavy and thick so it does not absorb fast into the skin. Second, it leaves a white cast on me that is hard to get rid of. Third, it did not really help control my oils as much as i wanted it to."
