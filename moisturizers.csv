It's non greasy and that is the best thing about it. * I wanted to try out a new skin care brand to see how it would be. The first two days everything was great and nourishing. But then later on it started to make my face red for about an hour before my face would fully calm down. It was like a heading sentation. I wanted fo make sure it was the moisturizer so i did my skincare without it and their was no redness. I myself somewhat doesn't have sensitive skin. So id recommend this to people who doesn't have sensitive skin to get this. * Love the moisture, light, not greasy or thick. * Got a free sample size of this & loved it so much I bought the big kahuna to last me. It made my skin look so fresh & radiant. I would buy again & again. * I have bought this item 2x and both times i ha e bought it i thought it was great! The first time i accidently left the cap off for about two days and it ""dried out"". The comor changed but it still worked great. The thing i have noticed however is that the moisture doesnt last as long as i would like. I usually wear it to bed and i understand it can rub off but i also have the tatcha one and that one lasts me till the following day. This one however is really light and does not feel thick. Its great under makeup and a little goes a long way. I would repurchase this for a third time! My skin can be very sensitive and this has given me no bad reactions whatsoever. I would jush be careful to not leave the cap off! * This product is amazing. It is the only moisturizer that I have found that truly makes my skin feel moisturized. When i wear it at night, i wake up with the perfect glowy skin. I could not recommend this product more * This moisturizer is really good and it leaves my face soft."

Read the ingredients and found it contains cinnamon bark extract!!! Why in the world would there be cinnamon in a MOISTURIZER Marketed towards youths?!? I would have never even thought to read the ingredients on a hydrating product for ingredients that burn. Needless to say we will be returning! * having sensitive acne prone skin makes it hard trying new products, but i'm so glad i listened to the reviews! this mask leaves your skin so smooth and hydrated and it didn't break me out! highly recommend coming from a licensed esthetician :) * I have only used this once because I was borrowing it from a freind and it's one of the best things that has ever gone on my face. Three days after using my face is still amazingly soft. Would most definitely recommend. * I haven't had a ton of opportunities to test this product, but so far, its not bad! It is a bit expensive, but not as expensive as some of the rest. This is a great mask overall! * It's so refreshing and moisturizing omg literally when it sokes in all of your face is so smooth no bumps no nothing you need to buy this it's a little pricy I know but it works * I love it so much it really helps alot and my skin is nice and clean in the morning"

This moisturizer was great the first week i used it. Absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling soft and supple. After applying i would get an instant glass-like finish and it really did make my skin look better… at first.

After that week I started to notice my pores were getting really clogged ( I rarely ever wear makeup so i know it wasnt that, and i had not changed anything else in my routine other than this moisturizer). I was getting blackheads in places on my face that I never had before. I got a few actual pimples on my forehead and one on my cheek. So i quickly stopped and switched to another moisturizer. 

I stayed the night at my boyfriends and forgot my new face cream, but still had the philosophy at his place. I figured i could use it once without issue. Wrong. I woke up the following day with dry flakes on my nose and multiple blackheads on my chin, cheeks and nose. My skin looks red and irritated. 

If you have sensitive skin, use with caution. I switched to the IT cosmetics Confidence in a Cream and that has done wonders for my skin. Have used it for 3 weeks now with no issue."

Sized * I have eczema on my tzone so ive struggled to find a moisturizer thatll give my make up a smooth hydrating finish.. I received a travel size sample of this product and it literally left my make up flawless with no patches! Im shocked . I just purchased the product and will be using from now on . Ill give an update. Also , my skin is normal just my t zone is dry * I love this moisturizer so much, and Drunk Elephant in general. It feels so luxurious—creamy, whipped, hydrating, gentle on my skin. I can tell and feel the difference when I wear it. * I have sensitive skin and i had seen this all over yt shorts. I wanted to try it out but they did not have the mini one in stock. So i was like ok i will just buy the bigger one and return it if i don't like it. Turns out you cannot return it. This made my skin break out really badly and it burned when i put it on. But i was just like well maybe that's supposed to happen. It in fact is not supposed to happen. I do not reccomend this for anyone with sensitive skin. So if you think it might break you out, just wait and buy the mini one when it is in stock. But if you want to possibly waste your money, than go ahead and buy the big one. No hate to this brand. I just don't like this product. * My daughter had this. I bought a jar and then bought her the big one when she ran out. I use it everyday and have gone through a couple jars now, but it hasnt done anything for my skin. I feel like it's just regular moisturizer.  I went back to read what all it was suppose to help with and I don't think it has. 
On the bright side, it doesnt break me out or burn my skin. it does hydrate it, I just haven't noticed any other benefits. I think I will try something new. * BEWARE: This moisturizer is terrible and a waste of money! I dont have sensitive skin and most/all the moisturizers I have used in the past don't cause me to break out, but this one caused some of the worst, deep, breakouts I've ever had. At first I was hesistant to think this broke me out but after my second and third use I continued to get deep painful pimples all over my face. I also didn't see any benefits to this product since it's: not hydrating, thin formula, small package for price, scent is slightly fermention-like. *deep sigh* as I throw out this product."

Not worth it too expensive even for the smallest one. * This is my all time favorite moisturizer. I have very sensitive dry skin and as soon as I put this on after my cleansing, my face feels so smooth and well moisturized. * I got this as a freebie for my birthday. About a month into using it, I have had the worst acne ever. Like- cystic acne that hurts so so bad. I have never experienced this. I will never ever buy the full size product, I threw the freebie away. Hoping my skin clears up soon, this is awful. * At 36, I'm trying to retain as much moisture as possible; and this definitely helps! I use this along with the hyaluronic acid serum and the avocado eye treatment, and I love how my skin is make up optional as a result. * Just a few dabs of this cream goes a long way. It feels very clean and pure on my face.  It is expensive but will last a long time. It moisturizes well, but I don't notice anything in particular with helping fine lines at all, is a good makeup base * I got a sample for my birthday and fell in love with it! I have sensitive skin, so it's tough to find products that are not going to make me break into hives. It keeps moisture in the skin all day, so you do not have to worry about replying consistently, and it's great to use before putting makeup on."

It cools the face and gives it a nice glow * I'm in my mid 40s, with sensitive combination skin, and this gel cream has been absolutely fantastic!  My previous moisturizer was a bit too heavy, and this one is just right for day and night use!!! * This product is going back! It was recommended to me because they were out of stock of my go-to product (a different brand). Upon applying a thin layer of Tula 24-7 Weightless Moisture Day & Night Gel Cream to my face and neck, something instantly felt off. The texture was fine so I couldn't place what it was. A minute or so later it started - the slight face burning. Minutes passed and it got to the point I couldn't ignore it and had to wash my face yet again just to get it off! * I received this as a free sample and now I'm hooked. It works so great for my skin. It leaves it refreshed without being heavy. Other moisturizers can be too thick but this is thin and blends perfectly. Worth the purchase! * I started using this moisturizer about one month ago because Tula discontinued my favorite, Super Soothe. I call this a very happy accident, because now my skin is better than ever. Very soft, smooth and moisturized. I'm 64 years old with very sensitive skin - most everything breaks me out. But my skin just drinks this in. It's not sticky, and I don't think my skin has ever been so soft - with zero breakouts. I do always use the Clear It Up toner before I moisturize - I'm sure that helps. * My skin is oily but I still want a plumping hydrating effect as I'm in my late 30s. Most gel moisturizers are too lightweight for me, this one is neither too light or too heavy.  The lactic acid gives a gentle exfoliation so my skin looks more even. * I love the original 24/7 moisturizer but i wanted to try something lighter for under sunscreen in the summer. I felt that this would be the perfect solution. It is light weight, but it doesnt feel like it dries down on my skin and left me feeling very sticky all day. I have combination skin with some dry spots. This felt hydrating enough but I just cant get past how sticky it is, and the smell is a tad unpleasant. I will be sticking with the classic 24/7 moisturizer in the future."

After trying few options this was my favorite * My first impression of this was excellent. It feels great going on, is hydrating, aborbs well. But after a few days of use, I started getting small bumps all over my face. (They weren't quite zits, just red raised bumps.)  I hadn't changed anything else in my routine, but I had been stressed out and thought that might be the cause. 

I took a break for about a week, the bumps went away and I started using this again. Within two days, the bumps were back. I tried using it as a body lotion and again, the bumps followed wherever I used it. 

So now I have a really expensive foot cream -- that's the only place I can use it without getting a reaction. 

Not sure if it was an allergic reaction or what, but it was super disappointing. I had used the prior formulation wtihout issue, but this new version is not working for me. * Doesnt go on the same and doesnt smell the same.  Been using for years!  Disapponted. * I have been using the IT Cosmetics Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Hydrating Moisturizer for years. My most recent purchase was not the same as all of my others. After reading the reviews, it appears that the other users feel the same way. Please bring back the original formula!!!! * I ran out of my usual moisturizer one day and was digging through my pile of samples and found this. I normally wouldn't have gravitated to this product in-store, but WOW! I love the texture. It's super rich and creamy, but it doesnt make me feel greasy like just about every other face cream ive tried. I use it at night after my retinol, but it also is great for an extra moisture boost in the winter under makeup during the day. I'm in my 30s and haven't really liked any anti-aging creams because they make me oily and i break out, but this one is perfect. I bought a full size and am trying the cleanser also. Love the scent. * Ill start by saying that my skin type has been pretty normal my whole life (im 33 years old), not oily but not dry either. However, it is sensitive and is prone to irritation and some acne. 

As im getting older though, my skin began looking more dull and my smile lines are starting to make themself known so i wanted something anti-aging and hydrating. Ive been using this moisturizer for 3 weeks now and not only does it keep my skin supple and hydrated, but it has helped even out the tone in just the short time ive used it. My skin looks more vibrant in the mornings (i use this once a day at night before bed after ive cleansed). So far it has cause no clogged pores or breakouts. My skin literally feels like silk which i love and makes applying makeup nice and smooth. The ONLY thing that I've noticed is my skin feels hot SOMETIMES. It does NOT make it red, but it just feels very warm and like i want to apply ice to my face. I've read that this is because of the niacinimide and that while uncommon, this can be a side effect. I will keep using this in spite of that in hopes my skin will acclimate and the warmth will go away over time. The results have been too good to quit using it. As far as the anti-aging goes, i dont think ive used the product long enough to see a change, but the extra hydration does help make the lines a little less noticeable. Overall i would recommend this product and will probably repurchase once i run out. * Love this moisturizer, I never go without it. I appreciate that it's not oily and makes my skin feel amazing. Will continue buying."

I was terrified but when I tell you that my skin has never ever been so smooth and hydrated! I thought my skin barrier was a myth it was so damaged but I know it is being rebuilt as I use this cream. I bought this a month ago and have had no irritations. Dry patches gone, itchiness gone. My pores are shrinking. One day when I go to a lower BP I'll switch to a gel moisturizer that I hope the Ordinary comes out with bc I can tell I won't need this intense hydration forever.

However, the bottle is so small that it wouldn't last me a week if I was to use this on my hands several times a day, and I sometimes use it on my feet too. I'll be looking for something else that offers more quantity but works just was well. * I tried this to compare with its competitor (iykyk), and it just didn't do it for me. Everyone's skin is different, so bear that in mind, but this one left a film on my face and there was no noticeable difference the next morning as opposed to the other brand, which left my skin soft, moisturized, healed, and supple. The most important quality in either one would be the healing properties, as I use this type of cream as a ""rescue"" cream when I've got skin irritation, redness, or a compromised barrier. I won't be repurchasing, but this may work for you. The cult following behind this cream and the other indicates that both work for a great deal of people. It all comes down to preference! * So i have used this for a few different purposes so far. It works great on cracked skin. Ive been sick and have been applying this on and around my nose with a qtip and it has really helped me not get that rough skin in that area that comes with being sick. Ive also put it on the skin around my eyes after i used a peeling product and gave myself a chemical burn, it really hwlped with the irritation and healing process. 10/10 would repurchase * Tretnoin user. This is such a wonderful soothing cream, start off with a pea size, dab all over and smear on, add more if needed. This cream goes on thick but then it turns into a smooth nice soothing cream. Good stuff! * I can't praise this product enough! I have acne prone skin and sometimes go a little too hard on chemical peels or exfoliating. This SAVES my skin barrier when I go to hard. It's perfectly gentle, hydrating, and protects my skin. This is a must have in my skincare routine. * I'm really concerned as to why some of the customers who have reviewed this product are using a HAND CREAM on their face ….. of course you're going to have a breakout …. * I started using perscription strength retinol a couple years ago and always dealt with a flare up of keratosis pelaris after use. I was looking for something that I could use while trying a retinol sandwich (applying all skin care, then retinol, then an additional heavier moisturizer on top once a week in the evening). One of my most trusted creators reccomended this cream and I have used La Roche Posay products in the past while I was taking isotret for acne and love their stuff! This is no different. It is a SUPER thick cream and a little goes a long way. It will feel greasy initially but just let it soak in, your skin will be baby smooth and hydrated in the morning! I have super sensitive skin and this doesn't break me out or irritate me at all. This is my second time purchasing."

I have been playing around with my perfect skincare routine and I think this product is what I needed. My skin gets horribly dry in the winter. I'm the dry skin queen. I was using another brand night cream, but that started clogging my pores. I bought ELF Holy Hydration moisturizer and my skin felt better. I saw this on sale and I was like, this probably would help. Omg. I put this on first, let it dry, then the elf cream. This + the elf has left my skin feeling smoother than ever before. Even when I wash my face in the shower my skin feels like pillows. 

I *think* this product enhances the ingredients of other products. Before I put this on, I use The Ordinary Niacinamide and ABA serums. I had been using both of these serums for like 8 months, with no noticeable difference in my dark spots. As soon as I added this Snail Cream in my routine, in a month the dark spots have reduced quicker than they had the whole 8 months before. So, yeah, I'm never going back! This has completely changed my skincare and I'm feeling wonderful. * My skin loves this, s littke goes a long way.

I've only been using the face mositurizer, face wash, the blue bottle exfoliter (twice a week), and the brightening kit (only at night) (all travel size) and my face looks & feels amazing. 

These are expensive products, but theres a spanish saying ""lo bueno cuesta"", in english ""the good things cost"" and with these products, I can agree. Also, a little bit really goes a long way. For the face wash, I only use a pea size and its really more than enough and prettu much same off all other products. * It moisturized my face so good.

I've been using this for two years now and nothing compares. I go on and off of it when I try new expensive creams/moisturizers. I have dullness as an og skin issue where my skin doesn't look as silky clean and plump as I want it to when i apply a cream and this is the only thing that consistently gives me that and brings my skin back to life after time away from it and using something else. I have been yearning for a new night cream lately just out of sheer boredom as I do from time to time and I randomly remembered that about 6 years ago my boujee friend had given me a sample of a cream that I tried once and woke up with baby soft radiant skin. I was just amazed at the drastic overnight difference in that sample.I was broke at that time and assumed it was expensive so I didn't bother to take note of what and where to buy it. Fast forward to now, texted her to hope she could remember that far back and she did! But turns out it was the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream... So in learning the cream I keep going back to is the one that wowed me years ago too is what prompted this review because I realize it is one of the rare products that has truly earned it's place as a staple and has been the only cream to consistently wow me over the span of 5+ years of trying different ones. * Very hydrating moisturizer. This goes on very thick, and I think it would be really nice for mature skin. I didn't notice a huge difference using this product, but overall I would say this is a great investment in skin care. * Let me start by saying this: If I could bathe in Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream, I would. And no, I'm not exaggerating. This cream is like what I imagine unicorn tears and liquid gold combined would feel like on my skin—pure, unadulterated luxury.

I first applied it one evening, thinking, ""Okay, let's see what the hype is all about."" The moment I rubbed it in, I heard a chorus of angels sing, and I'm pretty sure my reflection in the mirror whispered, ""Girl, where have you been all my life?"" Within minutes, my skin went from ""stressed-out and dehydrated"" to ""I've had 8 hours of sleep and an IV drip of green juice.""

Now, let's talk about the texture. It's thick—but not in the way your great aunt's fruitcake is thick. No, this is the decadent, velvety kind of thick that melts into your skin and leaves you looking like you've been airbrushed by the gods. The hydration? Next level. I'm talking ""surviving-the-Sahara-desert"" kind of hydration. It's like my skin just drank a tall glass of water after running a marathon, and it's still basking in the afterglow.

And the scent? A subtle floral elegance that makes you feel like you've been transported to a secret garden, where Charlotte herself is hand-picking petals for your personal batch of cream. Not too strong, just enough to make you feel like you're one luxurious human being.

But here's the kicker: This magic isn't temporary. After a couple of weeks of daily use, my skin genuinely feels softer, plumper, and smoother. I'm convinced my fine lines packed up and left town. I've had strangers ask me what my secret is, and let me tell you, it's a struggle not to whip out the jar and give them an impromptu skincare sermon.

The only downside? My skin now has expensive taste, and I may need to take out a small loan to keep my addiction going. But hey, beauty has its price, and Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream is worth every penny.

In summary: It's not just a cream, it's a life-altering skincare experience. Get it, and thank me (and Charlotte) later. * •I received this product complimentary from Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review! 
This cream is pure luxury! It cushions my skin in moisture and has a lovely scent. The packaging is beautiful as well. I used this moisturizer for a month and it has left me with plump beautiful skin! * I was hesitant in buying this product based off of all the hype, so when I was offered to test in return for my honest review I was quick to jump at the opportunity.

She's super moisturising which has been a life saver with the weather changing to cooler and less humid. A little goes a long way and leaves my skin feeling plump and hydrated. I'm loving the results after a month of testing the product.

Would I buy it? Most definitely, she's replaced two of my daily creams already. She's pretty to look at, with gorgeous packaging that's distinctive of the brand itself.

If you're doubting buying this product, I'm a firm supporter and wish I tried it sooner! It's in my mother and sisters Christmas present baskets!!! * I really like this cream . It goes on the skin like butter.  The skin soaks it up very well.  I love it's not heavy , it's silky smooth.  It smells absolutely amazing and isn't to powerful.  Made with high quality ingredients.  The price is kind of high for this product.  I can find stuff just as good for a cheaper price.  The overall look and concept is beautiful. * I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. This cream is extremely rich and luxurious feeling. With colder months coming up this will be perfect since my skin will be drier. It has a very faint rose scent that I don't mind, but I usually prefer fragrance free products on my face."

I also broke out horribly. Its way too perfumey for senstive skin. I just happened to get a sample of it & used it in a pinch * ilI have sensitive and acne prone skin at age 65.

In the mornings, my skin feels very hydrated and soft. * Tbh for +70$$ you would hope you see a difference in your skin. It was alright. Moisturizing I suppose but dont think it did much.

Works fine on skin and is a lightweight moisturizer. But is difficult to dispense as no tube to bring product to the surface. The bottle has to be stored upside down to make product available. * i had bought this because it doesnt contain any poor clogging ingredients but after a couple hourse of applying the moisturizer my face feels dry :(. like the consistency tho. * This is an amazing moisturizer! This is one of my favorites and compared to some it's not that expensive. For someone who has wacky skin this helps completely!! Please buy!!! * I thought I liked it , but I realized that after 1-2 weeks of using it I began to have commodores and irritation. The hydration doesn't last that long, there's definitely better moisturizers out there. * This is the bomb.com its so smooth and moistruzing on the skin. Pair this with a couple other byoma products and its HEAVEN. * I LOVE IT SM! * Not lightweight, its def a thick gel, doesnt seem to absorb into my skin, after 5 min my face did feel very soft and smooth but not like it really absorbed, its ok for a basic inexpensive gel. I will not buy, thanks for the sample."

Ive only used it a couple of times but its amazing! Works great as an overnight cream. Goes on thick but it feels so good! In the morning my skin is soft, less red and you cant see any dry patches. Other than the cost- i would highly recommend it! * I got this item in Gratis (free). I love drunk elephant and was so excited. I've tried their other moisturizers and they werent moisturizing enough for me at nighttime, so I switched to the Murad repair cream. Thats a beautiful, thick moisturizer in a pump bottle just like Drunk Elephants. Its been my holy grail and I was fully prepared for this to not compare.

While it has a nice texture and the ingredients look fabulous, this cream resulted in the worst allergic reaction I've ever experienced. After two uses, my skin was visibly red, tingly, textured, and incredibly itchy. Unfortunately think this damaged my barrier as my skin is still recovering using other tried and tested products. If you have sensitive skin, I'd skip. * Oh how I wanted to love this. The ingredient list looks nice, and I'd heard good reviews, but unfortunately this cream just did not work out for me. I have no idea what's causing it, but this moisturizer somewhat burns my skin every time I apply it. It also seems to be making my facial eczema worse. The texture is different, more of a whipped consistency, but still hydrating. I feel like my skin might need more moisture though. It's also expensive for what it is. Unfortunately it's too late for me to return it, and since it was pricey I'm going to use it up anyways, but I would not repurchase. Honestly you can find many just as good-if not better face creams out there with similar ingredients, that cost much less. * Made skin dry and itchy, not moisturizing. * I use this over the mad hippie super A serum, at night before I go to work. And I love this product. I don't use it twice a day but you probably could if you wanted to. This also feels like a rich moisturizer after I use the mad hippie enzyme scrub, it just makes my skin feel wonderful. I have acne prone skin and also wanted something good for anti aging, since 30 was approaching. * I wanted to love this product. I wanted a night cream with collagen & this has mostly good reviews. But the morning after the 1st time using it, I had 2 huge red zits (which is unlike my normal skin). Every time I use it, I break out the next morning. * Love how soft this cream makes my face feel!

I only need to blot once a day at work instead of three! * I have used FAB products before. Always liked their daily moisturizer but i have oily skin so it didn't help, but this oil control moisturizer helps a lot. My skin doesn't look as shiny. Perfect product for summer. It is not heavy at all. * In my search for an oil-free moisturizer this was recommended. I used this for a month and loved it. No breakouts, controlled my oily skin and seemed to work really well. So, I stocked up and got more. I noticed something was different after the 3rd use of the new jar. I started breaking out. I haven't broken out in almost 3 years. I was confused and continued to use it because why would it start breaking me out now? I loved the first jar. I'm not sure if the formula changed or if my skin is just being finicky. 

Overall, I recommend the product because it seems to be very good. It's a struggle for us oily girls to find products that offer us a balance of hydration while keeping oil at bay. I hope it works for you if you try it :) * Ever since Neutrogena discontinued their Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin - my holy grail of moisturizers - I have been desperately searching for a replacement that will keep my breakouts under control without over-drying my skin. The search is finally over - this is it!! My skin starting clearing up and looking healthier after the first overnight application! I've now been using it for 2 months and it's continued to significantly reduce my breakouts (in frequency and duration) without drying out my skin. The only downside is that the container is about half the size I was assuming it would be, based on other FAB products I've purchased. (Although that's on me for not looking at the size printed on the front of the product.) Each container lasts me a little over 2 months with one application per day on my face and sometimes neck and/or chest. Honestly though I'm in love. * Ive used this product for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin and have used several different face moisturizers over the years and this is the only one that keeps my face from getting super shiny by the end of the day, even with serums underneath it. It WORKS so to me its worth every penny! * This is the best moisturizer I have ever found for my oily skin! I have an oily t-zone and this keeps my skin from becoming oily all day. I worked an 8-hour shift wearing this and when I got home my forehead was still dry, but not peeling, it just felt finally normal. I use this on my entire face, but keep in mind you can use it only in certain areas that you struggle with oil, so don't let other reviews about dry skin deter you. With winter coming up I may begin to only use this on my oily areas and another moisturizer on others, but this is literally the holy grail moisturizer for anyone struggling with oily skin. * I have combination skin and this has saved my skin texture and made it so soft. The consistency feels so nice and it's not overly drying even in my dry areas. Feel like it's reduced some redness as well."

Also, the bloom cap got stuck in the twist of lid and I couldn't even use it after not having it for long. I unfortunately won't be re-pruchasing. * My daughter had an immediate allergic reaction yo this product.   It was terrible.  She was upset.  What's worse is that the aesthetician at Ulta specifically recommended it for her sensitive skin.  I would never buy this brand again, especially after I looked at the long list of ingredients that are definitely not the 'clean' ingredients they claim they are. * I really wanted to love this brand and was sold on the idea they are clean and sulfate free but their 5th ingredient is sulfate. So now it makes sense why it has been causing redness and more dry skin. So disappointing! * Love it * So weird i purchased a travel size from the chekcout counted and i loved it so i purchased the big bottle and after a week of using it my face started getting super patchy dry not sure what happend is the formula different from the small travel size from the big ??? Also the travel size bottle was more watery fresh consistency and the big bottle the cream was super thick feeling and even more once applying .so disappointed * I have used this moisturizer for year and never had issues with. It was lightweight and worked well with my skin. I've purchased recently tube and bottle and both formula feel a bit more thicker and I feel it's the cause of recent breakout which never happened with previous purchases. * I purchased this along with the serum. they burned my skin. I only used it three times. I don't like the dispenser or the smell. doesn't do much at all for my normal skin. it's supposed to be good ingredients so I don't understand the burning."

Red patches all over my face! * love how this makes my skin feel comfortable and plumped hydrated skin. never felt better * I've tried numerous skincare products over the years, but the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair line stands out like nothing else. The potency of the formula is remarkable, and the speed at which I noticed results was truly amazing. Within a short period, my skin felt smoother, firmer, and more rejuvenated. It's evident that this product is designed with high-quality ingredients that actually work. If you're looking for something that delivers visible results quickly, I highly recommend giving this a try! * I use this product along with the wrinkle reducing serum and feel that this combination has been very beneficial to my skin, which looks far younger than my age. * I have used the Smart Night line for years. I always went back to it and my skin looked great. I don't know what they did to this product, but it has made by skin break out with a terrible allergic reaction. This formula is NO good.

I have oily skin and probably spend upwards of $1K a year on products trying to find things that actually do as they claim, and this is one of them.

I was a little reluctant to purchase this as the price is pretty high for a brand I've never used, but I'm glad that I took the risk on it.  Prior to this moisturizer I was either using none at all (because most others just make me more oily, dont need redundant products on oily skin), or I was using the La-Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Matte one which didn't do much for me. Obviously how this will work for you is going to be different for everyone, and the other products you use prior to your moisturizer will make a difference as well.

For reference I am a 28 yr old female, white/Caucasian.  My morning routine is: wash with a clay based cleanser (Dermalogica), tone (Fenty Skin), hyperpigmentation serum (Good Molecules), niacinamide/zinc serum (Sunday Riley), then this moisturizer. The consistency of this product is great for oil as it is a gel based product, but it comes out more opaque white than clear which is fine. It does not have much of a fragrance that I have noticed, but I'm not sensitive to fragrance so I wouldn't be one to say. When I put this on it almost feels as if it is a crossover between a moisturizer and a makeup primer that blurs your pores.  Now it does not make your pores go away by any means, but it does HELP.  Immediately after applying my skin is definitely mattified but again, not completely shine free as if it is a primer with the sole purpose of making your skin look like it has powder on it. It does not make my skin feel tight and dried out, it genuinely makes me feel moisturized and smooth without the glowy look that normal moisturizers do. From my experience it definitely does not keep me matte for 8 hours, I would say after about 3-4 hours I start to see shine on my face to the point where I feel the need to blot if I were going out somewhere (this is all without wearing makeup or anything on top of my morning skin routine, I work from home).

If you truly have an oily/combo skin type this is not going to be your holy-grail product that makes all of your problems disappear (will continue to search for it), but if it is within your budget for a product of this type then this is 100% top 5 best moisturizers for oily skin on the market right now in my opinion after having used this for a few weeks now.  Would repurchase (and I rarely ever find products I do)!  

I also just want to throw out there that I did buy this on my own, was not asked/paid to write this, and I think this is either my only review I've ever written on Ulta or one of a few over a span of years that I don't even remember. * The packaging is very luxe but the pump feels like its empty and its still half full. It doesn't mattify anything but it is a nice mix of a gel and lotion and a lightweight moisturizer. This is an MLM and I do feel it's overpriced for what it is. It's pretty basic. * Matte effect that works great as a moisturizer/ primer for oily skin types"

It comes out thick and feels like you're slathering a bunch of heavy cream all over your face. But it absorbs completely, very quickly, leaving no layer of oily residue that you get from a lot of moisturizers. Even if i use a lot, like a mask, it still absorbs with a non greasy finish which is a dream for people who have oily combo skin. I really can't believe how much I love this face cream, as I bought it on a whim and I have trouble finding lotions that work with my combination skin.  And as a lot of people commented, it's perfect for priming before makeup * It is really lightweight and truly a little goes a very long way, Im just allergic to it * I have oily combo skin that gets dehydrated in winter. 

This was way too light and also a bit too thick. My skin was crying out for moisture. I wish I had returned this. I will only be able to use this in summer but it might be too thick for summer. * I like the way my skin feel and looks after each use. * I have very, VERY sensitive skin, in addition to my allergies to tree nuts, gluten, and soy, and this is one of the few moisturizers that I can use with confidence. It layers beautifully under makeup, does not have a fragrance, and lasts all day. * Worst moisturizer. Does the opposite of moisturize, which is frustrating considering this is a moisturizer 🤦‍♀️ leaves a white cast and doesn't moisturize my skin well, my skin gets dry as the day goes on, yet with other moisturizers i don't have this problem. Only works if i use a hydrating serum underneath. * Ive been using this for about a month now, I received a decent size on in one of the makeup bags. I think this is great for either beginners in their skin care routine or if you have dry skin and need a quick hydrating cream. I would consider this more of a medium thickness feeling cream I can wear it during the day, layer it up at night. Helped my wind burned cheeks. But I never wore it upder makeup so idk how it would do."

I really like the moisturizer and would say it really works for all skin types! * Certainly! Here's a suggestion for a short and positive review:

The Belif True Cream Aqua Bomb is a game-changer for anyone seeking lightweight yet deeply hydrating skincare. Its gel-like texture absorbs instantly, leaving my skin feeling refreshed, smooth, and perfectly balanced without any greasy residue. I love how it delivers intense moisture while keeping my skin breathable, making it perfect for daily use and under makeup. A must-have for maintaining a healthy, radiant complexion! * I loved this moisturizer until they changed the formula. My skin hates niacinamide. * Love this stuff and this company I want to see more of this company products online and in the store. Why is it not being sold in the stores or online like it's always sold out  I want this people. * I love the entire Aqua Bomb line. The moisturizer is by far my favorite. It is better than any of the $100+ moisturizers I've used. * The texture feels amazing! I have very sensitive skin and this has felt so creamy and smooth on my skin with no break outs. Def recommend!"

But I am utterly disappointed. It caused severe eye irritation that i had to go see an ophthalmologist. No sunscreen has caused me such reaction so i was worreid. However i do think it's a good moistirozer with SPF but its just not for me. * This moisturizer initially feels amazing on the skin, and it worked well under my makeup. However, after a few hours, my eyes began to burn and sting! It happened on 2 separate days so i know that it is this moisturizer. Again, i really wanted to like this but it really irritates my eyes. * This is a really great SPF moisturizer. It really holds up to its name. I've been looking at this brand for months and finally got it. I've only been using this for a little under a week but this by far, has been the best SPF moisturizer I've EVER used. Someone who works at Ulta said this was a really great product; she was correct. What sold me is when she said it holds up really well for people who have oily skin, which is an issue for me so I have an issue with products that make my skin extra oily. This is very lightweight and worth the money. I just need to see how this holds up with this FL heat. * I thought this was the perfrct match for me as i am lazy and hate having to layer moisturizer with an SPF and get greasy quick. This dries down matte at first but within an hour or so is super greasy and makes my face very shiny. For the price I expected better. * I tend to find most sunscreens to be greasy, oily, or sticky even when they claim otherwise. I assumed this would be the same especially since its a sunscreen moisturizer combo. However I was wrong!  The texture and finish is so so lovely. It's very lightweight and glides on nicely, moisturizes without leaving me feeling like a shiny greasy mess! It's perfect under make too. Highly recommend! * It is weightless but it burns yours eyes terribly when you go to take it off ...and it's not sweat proof...for the almost $50 this is I expect more out of a spf moisturizer. There are drugstore brands that can offer the same for a way less price point. Definitely returning. * For some reason, every other facial sunscreen I've tried either made my face red and hot, had a sticky texture, or made my skin bumpy and textured afterwards. This is the only sunscreen without any of these issues! It feels like a regular, lightweight moisturizer in every way, and washes off easily without any texture or stickiness."

I have sensitive skin and rosacea, i tried there firming moisturizer first before i bought this to see if i would have a reaction to tula products
The bundle is definitely a great deal and so far i have no issues or no break outs, its been a week! * Tula has helped my skin so much! I was scared to use it at first because my skin is so sensitive! But since ive been using i dont get big painful breakouts anymore! My skin is clear, soft, and glowing! I also used to have the little sweat bumps on my face, completely gone since using this! It did take about two weeks to see the results! So if you wait youll see the difference! On month 3 of using it! * The reviews got me on this one and I decided to give it a try. Spoiler, I regret it so much. This is definitely not for sensitive skin with all of the highly fragrant ingredients in it. I thought my face was purging but after two months, I couldnt take it anymore. Its been 3 months sonce stopping and im still trying to recover from the skin damage it caused. Not all skin types are alike but I think less basic skin care is probably best. The eye balm is nice and works with awaking but I also think it made my dark circles worse. * My favorite is the so polished exfoliating scrub, but all of the products complement each other. I look forward to washing my face now! * I have only used the moisturizer and toner so far but I love them both. The toner doesn't irritate my skin and the moisturizer does a great job without making my skin oily * So far, so good! * I bought this set for my preteen daughter to help her establish a good skin care routine! She loves all the products in the set!"

This is it! Love the clean ingredients and that it doesnt have much of a smell. My husband has even started using it, and that is saying something. * I have tried so many moisturizers. I have sensitive skin and I am also very careful with certain ingredients I use on my skin. This is the best moisturizer, it's hydrating but not greasy and great for day or night. I just mix it with my sunscreen in the morning. * I wanted to love this moisturizer because its clean- I didn't even mind the smell even though some complain about it. But I noticed after several weeks of use, I had many blackheads on my nose and chin. I didn't realize it wasn't non-comedogenic so that was on me for not paying attention. If you have acne or get breakouts, I wouldn't recommend this. * I wish the people who get the products for FREE other wise known as influencers would just be honest. I found it no big deal I've used other products for alot less money, but the 5 ⭐ crews won't be getting free stuff if they don't give a high score. Wait a few weeks to buy it and if you don't like return it, so this is an HONEST review. * Love it!! * I highly recommend this! I kept finding moisturizers that either broke me out or pilled on my face (deal breaker). This one does neither and keeps my face moisturized. It is on the pricey side, but I bought it on sale. The only thing I don't love is the smell. At first it just smells like nothing, but once I rub it in it's almost a chemical smell? Not sure, but I'll take that over not breaking me out. * It goes on like silk and makes your face feel soft and smooth. Feels good after I put on my toner and serums and then it's like a nice after finish. Good smell. Overall the best moisturizer I've used. Somewhere between a gel and a cream"

It helps retain moisture for my dry skin, but other than that, I didn't notice a huge difference.  I'm glad I tried it, but it's not a repurchase for me due to the price. * Works well on oily skin, soaks in almost instantly, and is very hydrating. But a little goes a long way so be careful not to use too much. The consistency of the cream is a bit thick compared to other creams I've tried in the past. A jar of this could easily last 3 months making it more affordable than it seems. The scent is a bit orange-y but also a bit chemically, but not overly strong. My skin is sensitive to scented products and does not react to this. My oily skin has done well with Olehenriksen brand products in general and I've seen a lot of improvement using them. * I recieved this in a sample and am back to purchase full size. My skin is constantly irritated, red, and rough. Using this morning and night has been a game changer. My rough patches on my cheeks are going down, my pores are smaller. I really have nothing negative to say except the price, but ill srill be purchasing. * I have combination skin & used this for a month. I don't really see much of a difference in this after switching from Clinique Moisture Surge. I wanted to try this brand because I love the toner, but don't love this moisturizer enough to buy again. * If you aren't using this moisturizer, what are you waiting for?! Yes, it's a little on the pricey side, but a little goes a long way and a jar will easily last you four months or so. Beautiful texture, goes on beautifully, plays well with all of my other products. If you're looking for a peptide cream, this is the one. * Take great skin moisturizer leaves your skin, glowing and bright, but for my skin did make me a little too oily better for the winter than the summer for me but honestly, it's a great product and it made my skin look amazing didn't like that I had to keep wiping my face * This product clumps up and doesnt absorb into skin very well. Showed no difference in my pores. Overpriced."

My skin even looks more glowy I've had to look a few times to make sure there weren't any filters on my camera. * This is amazing for a glowy look, its do thick and creamy, but its light at the same time.

I have noticed really nice improvements in my skin's texture and appearance.  Really happy I gave this brand a try. * I've tried several different moisturizers, and the glass skin water-gel is absolutely amazing. 
The product makes my face feeling refreshed and so soft.

Detergents, aquaphor, basically everything. A couple Dermalogica products for sensitive skin are some of the only things that don't cause dermatitis and severe redness and inflammation. I was sad when ULTA no longer carried their barrier repair cream, but I love this new product bc it does the same thing plus adds additional moisture. Not a fan of the container, for the price id prefer a tube so I can use every last drop. Please continue making! * I never write reviews but felt I had to - this cream paired with prequel's gleaner, ans hydration and redness serums have absolutely changed my skin. A full 180 in look and feel! Ive always had super dry and sensitive skin, later to be diagnosed as rosacea type 2. After tons and tons of reseaech and trial and error, this combo has reduced 95% of my redness and bumps. I'll never go back to cerave or vanicream again! * I love dermalogica products and this missed the mark for me. I got it to try and reduce redness but it did not make my skin less red and was thick and greasy! I dont feel like my face was more moisturized either. I love their other products though! * This feels amazing. It's calmed my skin and is moisturizing. I haven't had any breakouts since using this. Love! * This is the only moisturizer that has worked living in the Arizona desert! It took years to find one that helped my dehydrated,flaky skin with the weather here. It also doesn't contain Hyaluronic Acid,which is not favorable to use in the desert. * I went looking for a particular primer that Ulta apparently doesn't carry. A rep for derma told me about this product being used as not only a repairing moisturizer but could be used as a primer as well. Ugh my skin & makeup has never felt so good! * After trying many products, this cream eliminated my dry crusty winter skin. I used it morning and evening, with in one week I noticed a difference. After three weeks my skin was completely restored."

It cools the face and gives it a nice glow * I'm in my mid 40s, with sensitive combination skin, and this gel cream has been absolutely fantastic!  My previous moisturizer was a bit too heavy, and this one is just right for day and night use!!! * This product is going back! It was recommended to me because they were out of stock of my go-to product (a different brand). Upon applying a thin layer of Tula 24-7 Weightless Moisture Day & Night Gel Cream to my face and neck, something instantly felt off. The texture was fine so I couldn't place what it was. A minute or so later it started - the slight face burning. Minutes passed and it got to the point I couldn't ignore it and had to wash my face yet again just to get it off! * I received this as a free sample and now I'm hooked. It works so great for my skin. It leaves it refreshed without being heavy. Other moisturizers can be too thick but this is thin and blends perfectly. Worth the purchase! * I started using this moisturizer about one month ago because Tula discontinued my favorite, Super Soothe. I call this a very happy accident, because now my skin is better than ever. Very soft, smooth and moisturized. I'm 64 years old with very sensitive skin - most everything breaks me out. But my skin just drinks this in. It's not sticky, and I don't think my skin has ever been so soft - with zero breakouts. I do always use the Clear It Up toner before I moisturize - I'm sure that helps. * My skin is oily but I still want a plumping hydrating effect as I'm in my late 30s. Most gel moisturizers are too lightweight for me, this one is neither too light or too heavy.  The lactic acid gives a gentle exfoliation so my skin looks more even. * I love the original 24/7 moisturizer but i wanted to try something lighter for under sunscreen in the summer. I felt that this would be the perfect solution. It is light weight, but it doesnt feel like it dries down on my skin and left me feeling very sticky all day. I have combination skin with some dry spots. This felt hydrating enough but I just cant get past how sticky it is, and the smell is a tad unpleasant. I will be sticking with the classic 24/7 moisturizer in the future."

I liked it well enough, but it ended up taking a backseat to my other well-loved lotions and creams. Then I got pregnant and developed cystic acne on my chin that was painful, and I couldnt get it to go away. I tried switching out my favorite Cerve nighttime cream for this Avene cream and OMG those large, deep pimples cleared up in a matter of days! I'm so thankful I had this on hand and will definitely be repurchasing. * Worked wonders for me and all the small bumps on my skin disappeared after using this * I absolutely love this stuff and always have a bottle on hand! Its great for sensitive skin that is prone to irritation. Any time I've had skin reactions on my face, this is the product I reach for to help with the itchiness and dryness. It's very hydrating (a bit thicker) while still working well with oily skin. I especially love using this in the colder and drier winter months. * I had high hopes for this product but it caused itching after applying. It also pilled and felt like it left an unpleasant film on my face. After three days I developed a few breakouts and clogged pores. It's poorly formulated. * Too harsh on my skin * But unfortunately it doesn't work well for me. I haven't found a moisturizer that doesn't cause my face to turn red and feel hot to the touch * I use this as a night time moisturizer during warm weather. I started using this when I had a really bad rash and acne on my face due to over washing and high humid whether. It kept my skin moisturizered while it healed and did not cause more skin issues.
Pros: light, moisturizing, good for my sensitive skin, no smell, does the job in spring and summer months when humidity and heat is high 
Cons: too light for cold months, small amount for the amount you get and the cost but it does last for a season or so"

Will definitely repurchase * I use this about twice a week and glycolic acid 1-2 times a week and it seriously diminishes the appearance of my acne overnight * This didn't break me out or leave me dry, but I also layer it with hydrating products. I use it 3 times a week and no problems. I see a significant difference the morning after which is a good sign. Will definitely recommend * I'm so glad I tried this product! It's on the cheaper side and the formulation is great. I typically use it two days in a row at night, and have a one day break in between. I've found that it's really prevented pimples for me and is the only thing that helped with my blackheads on my nose (and I've tried soooo many different products for this)! 

I use this nightly and I follow up with the Hyaluronic Acid from the Ordinary, plus a heavier moisturizer to lock everything in. I also switched to a moisturizing face wash, just to avoid any dryness / irritation from the retinol. My skin was so dull looking before this, and after using this I've felt confident in the clearness / brightness of my skin again. Definitely give it a try! * Now dont get it twisted, this is still a retinol. So be careful if you have sensitive skin. I applied moisturizer first and then this on top the first time I tried it. I do see some mild flaking around my nose area. My skin does look smoother the next day. I'll keep an eye on it and see if I can notice a difference after I'm through with the tube. It smells kinda weird, as others have noticed. * been using this for a few days now and not had any irritation. it's also affordable. * Thought the 4.8 stars was a good sign, but I used this product for 2 days and it burned my skin. It has started to peel and I have social events to go to."

I would probably not buy this again because i prefer another brand. * This is actually a really good moisturizer, and at a way better price then a lot of other ones out there. Very thick and moisturizing, i wouldnt recommend for someone who gets greasy easily. Great for very dry skin and in the winter. * I was on the hunt for a hydrating moisturizer and while this certainly fit the bill, if you, like me, have congestion-prone skin, I would recommend looking elsewhere. This feels lovely and hydrating but the clogged pores on my cheekbones don't lie. * As someone who has atopic dermatitis (eczema) and dry skin, this moisturizer does wonders for my skin! Very moisturizing with a nice thick consistency. Only small con is I wish it blended quicker but might be bc its a rich cream. Still a 10/10! * I love peach and lily glass products, but not this product. The product is way too pricey and the jar isn't even full. Too little product for such a high price. It made me breakout, would not buy this again."

I love the way it moisturizes and doesn't leave a greasy feel. Skin on my face feels so soft all day long. Had to buy a full size and now the gift one is in my travel bag. * My mother bought this product and I noticed it had a strong fragrance to it. Now I'm not a dermatologist, but I have enough knowledge to know that anything fragrance is horrible for your skin. Anyway, my skin broke out in hives when I tried this product, along with acne. Please don't buy skincare from Lancome, it's not the best for most people. * I love how this looks on my skin! It's matte but hydrating. Happy that it has hyaluronic acid as well. My makeup looks so good now! I used to use tatcha but didn't like oily it made my skin look. This will now be my go to! * I have normal to dry skin, but a lot of moisturizers will clog my pores if i sleep in them. I just stopped wearing a mositurizer to bed altogether for a while for this reason. When I saw the ingredients in this I became curious and decided to give it a try. My skin is so hydrated and looks beautiful in the morning! Also, if i develop a blemish during the day, I will still slap this moisturizer on top of it at night and not only does it not make it worse, it actually heals it and my skin clears up so much faster!

It comes out thick and feels like you're slathering a bunch of heavy cream all over your face. But it absorbs completely, very quickly, leaving no layer of oily residue that you get from a lot of moisturizers. Even if i use a lot, like a mask, it still absorbs with a non greasy finish which is a dream for people who have oily combo skin. I really can't believe how much I love this face cream, as I bought it on a whim and I have trouble finding lotions that work with my combination skin.  And as a lot of people commented, it's perfect for priming before makeup * It is really lightweight and truly a little goes a very long way, Im just allergic to it * I have oily combo skin that gets dehydrated in winter. 

This was way too light and also a bit too thick. My skin was crying out for moisture. I wish I had returned this. I will only be able to use this in summer but it might be too thick for summer. * I like the way my skin feel and looks after each use. * I have very, VERY sensitive skin, in addition to my allergies to tree nuts, gluten, and soy, and this is one of the few moisturizers that I can use with confidence. It layers beautifully under makeup, does not have a fragrance, and lasts all day. * Worst moisturizer. Does the opposite of moisturize, which is frustrating considering this is a moisturizer 🤦‍♀️ leaves a white cast and doesn't moisturize my skin well, my skin gets dry as the day goes on, yet with other moisturizers i don't have this problem. Only works if i use a hydrating serum underneath. * Ive been using this for about a month now, I received a decent size on in one of the makeup bags. I think this is great for either beginners in their skin care routine or if you have dry skin and need a quick hydrating cream. I would consider this more of a medium thickness feeling cream I can wear it during the day, layer it up at night. Helped my wind burned cheeks. But I never wore it upder makeup so idk how it would do."

Many very expensive!! So I thought I would try the E.L.F products. First the price is wonderful! I use all their products, and I love them all. Not just the skin products but the makeup. * My skin has become insanely dry since I hit my mid-30s. Couple that with already sensitive skin and rosacea and it has been a test of patience trying to find a moisturizer that works well, isn't greasy, irritating, has a strong smell, or more expensive than I'd ever want to pay for a skincare product I need to use regularly.

This moisturizer has solved all of those issues! Admittedly, I only use it at night, but I need less than a dime size amount to cover my face. It soaks in quickly, doesn't feel greasy, and hasn't irritated my skin. * Been using this for a long time and is my go-to night time moisturizer. * I purchased this as a ""dupe"" after running oit of the Tula moisturizer. I should have known it was too good to be true. It has broken me out in tiny little ""pimples"" or something after my skin was finally cleared up. I won't make that mistake again."

Issue is, after a while of daily use, my skin would feel dry; even patchy.

Reviews are good but that strong perfume smell.  might use it on chest instead of face to use up. * Ive tried a lot of face creams, this is definitely in my top 3. This cream is ideal for mornings where you want something moisturizing but not too oily. I can also see a difference in brighness and fine lines. I also feel like this cream works with most skin types. I have dry skin and it works well as a day cream. * About two months ago I received a super sample of this and I was SHOCKED at the difference in my skin within 48 hours. My fine lines were already fading and my skin was taught. At 46 years old I've tried every serum and moisturizer, including high end brands such as Sunday Riley and Drunk Elephant only to be left with little to no results and wasted money. This particular line of Lancome products is expensive and beyond my normal budget but it is worth every penny. I just started using the serum and these products have changed my life. I will always look for the best sales and discounts but if I would pay full price because this moisturizer is magic and now a permanent staple in my skincare routine and I HIGHLY recommend this for all women my age and up in need of help fighting fine lines and wrinkles and skin elasticity. * This product has improved the appearance of my skin without causing any breakouts. I love the texture and it has a pleasant smell to it * I've always used the old formula for years, but when I was given the travel size when I had purchased a set it came with it and I DID NOT like it. It felt too gelish that I was skeptical in purchasing this size. But I did anyway because Lancôme has been my go to brand for years now. I feel in love, my face felt so smooth and plump on the first try. Loved the way my makeup set and looks. Definitely a keeper!! * Nice product. Could see results in a couple days * Yes, my skin feels better and there may be some improvement in fine lines. The price is too high for my budget and I am disappointed in the packaging. The outside jar is much bigger than the actual inside pot that holds the product. Seems dishonest."

The store associate introduced me to the Juice line, and it is the first product line that I honestly felt almost instantaneous results. * I started with the samples and i was really hoping I would hate it since it is so expensive. Unfortunately I loved it, and now I'm forced to spend a fortune on skincare. Use with their vitamin c, primer, foundation and translucent powder and your aging face will thank you, but your bank account won't. * I love juice beauty's products so I couldn't wait to try this product! I used it night cream the first night I got it and woke up and washed my face and placed on the day cream. Moments afterward my face began to feel very itchy and uncomfortable. If I would itch it would leave scratch welts all over my face (what it looks like when a dog jumps up and scratches you is the best way to describe it), followed by an itchy sensation from my head to my toes. Once I would itch I would get little hive bumps and the scratch welts all over my body. Very sad this product did not work out for me, but wanted to warn others that have sensitive skin. * This moisturizer is very thick and seems to be a great product with the exception of the smell. It is a vibrant apple/lemon like a candy. 
Reminds me of a teenage type product, unfortunately it is to potent to use at night, to try to fall asleep it just keeps me up. * I love both the day and night moisturizer. The day is light and great under makeup, the night is thicker and really hydrates my skin. They also smell great!"

It think its delightful and doesn't linger too long but you have to understand what the product is derived from which rose petals snd buds. I use it day and night it I have seen improvements in my skin texture. * Got this on sale to try out some other moisturizer options (go-to is Peach&Lily matcha pudding). The texture is wonderful, and I do think it helped with my dry/sensitive skin, but I am not personally a huge fan of the strong fragrance. * i loved this moisturizer until i realized it wasnt cruelty free… a very nice subtle rose scent that i loved. sad i have to discontinue using this moisturizer. * Fresh has won me over with yet another great product! I bought the mini size initially but ordered the full size within a couple days because it's truly amazing.

It also caused my make up to separate even when allowing 15 minutes to dry before applying foundation. I've increased my moisturizer usage hoping that would help offset the dryness, but it has not helped at all.

I'm obsessed with how easy it is to apply after my skincare and it was no issue at all with my makeup after application! It doesn't have a typical sunscreen smell. I will say, for someone like myself who had oily combo skin, this might be a hit or miss for you, but for myself personally I didn't mind it at all :) * My sister-in-law got this and I've always wanted to try it and have it my own and I love it 😊 * Smells terrible and goes on like flaky paste. Overall gross feeling. Very dissatisfied. * I've tried countless sunblocks, most of which caused me breakouts and I usually hate the way they feel on my skin or smell. This one is my GOAT.

This moisturizer was great the first week i used it. Absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling soft and supple. After applying i would get an instant glass-like finish and it really did make my skin look better… at first.

After that week I started to notice my pores were getting really clogged ( I rarely ever wear makeup so i know it wasnt that, and i had not changed anything else in my routine other than this moisturizer). I was getting blackheads in places on my face that I never had before. I got a few actual pimples on my forehead and one on my cheek. So i quickly stopped and switched to another moisturizer. 

I stayed the night at my boyfriends and forgot my new face cream, but still had the philosophy at his place. I figured i could use it once without issue. Wrong. I woke up the following day with dry flakes on my nose and multiple blackheads on my chin, cheeks and nose. My skin looks red and irritated. 

If you have sensitive skin, use with caution. I switched to the IT cosmetics Confidence in a Cream and that has done wonders for my skin. Have used it for 3 weeks now with no issue."

Many sit on top of my skin or feel heavy especially once you add sunscreen on top. This product absorbs quickly and actually makes my skin feel and look plumped. It also feels cool which I like a lot and has a clean, non-offending scent. It's a thick cream that's soft & pillowy and improves my skin's overall appearance. * I started with the sample.  I loved it.  Very creamy.  A little goes a long way. * I was concerned about the switch to a new line of creams as I've been using the old smart night cream for years as a night cream, but overall have been satisified with the change. I'm 29 and was recommended by an Ulta employee in the store the lifting face + neck cream. The cream is a completely new product. It is thicker, much firmer texture than the old one. It is also bright white. It does not have a noticeable fragrance. (The jar says fragrance free). I use it as a night cream and can definitely see and feel the difference in 'firmness' and 'lifting' in my neck; although I didn't think I really needed it and that wasn't why I used the original night cream. I have noticed some white heads in my forehead/T-Zone, but I tend to get them occasionally anyway so I can't blame the cream on it. After reading about the other variations, I wish I had the SPF version so I can try wearing it twice a day with my makeup over it. I'll be giving this one to my mom and trying the SPF one next. :) * This is returnef the plumpness to my cheeks has lifted my laugh lines and I don't look as sallow under my eyes. This cream is amazing I thought I needed a facelift but after using this clinically proven product were 100% of women saw results I'm in love. I've never had more compliments on my skin and I'm 62. * Been using new product for 3 weeks, so far not real happy also higher price . * I love this face and neck cream.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.  I like that I can also use for my neck. * My face and neck are covered in red glitter after using this. If I wanted glitter all over my face and neck I'd buy a product specifically for that. It is not clear on the package unless you scrutinize the ingredients. It's mica on the ingredients"

HOWEVER, I wish they would change the pump lid....it works a few times and then stops.  You end up having to unscrew it just like a normal jar to get the moisturizer out.  It needs to stop wasting money on these lids and quit trying my patience.  A NORMAL Lid is preferred to one that quits working. * I love this serum!! It feels really good on my face and i see a small difference in my wrinkles * I have sensitive skin and use this daily. I see the results within hours. My skin feels tighter. My pores are reduced. After a few days all the pores and blackheads on my nose almost gone. The fine lines on my forehead and undereyes have diminished. * Product is incredible.

I thought it would be okay to use on my face even though I have ""normal"" skin because this is a product for ""sensitive"" skin, meaning it would be okay for any skin type (so I thought). I broke out after 2 days of using it. I don't normally breakout, so when a whole patch of zits popped up on both my cheeks and forehead, I was so confused. I stopped using it 
after another day because I knew nothing else I was using caused this since everything I normally use hasn't caused this reaction. After about 3 or 4 days, everything cleared up and I am now going to return this. Lesson I took away from this, don't buy everything you see someone asvertising on tiktok! * I was influenced from tiktok and was so excited to not spend so much money on skincare, but this left me with the worst acne I've ever had in my life. I recently saw something that said it clogs pores and I can't use it on my face anymore. * Got this product after seeing it listed as a good option for people with sensitive skin who are acne prone a few times online, plus I needed a thicker, unscented moisturizer for my night routine. Ordered it and prayed this stuff wasn't going to instantly upset my skin (products that don't agree with me tend to give me breakouts and irritate/burn my skin). Good news for me - I didn't seem to have any of those feared reactions. While this product is definitely on the thicker side, you don't need very much of it and you get a decent amount of product for the price. I still haven't finished my first bottle, but I'm happy to report that in the last 2 months of using it daily, my skin feels more hydrated, doesn't seem to be causing me any extra breakouts, and I wake up with soft, nourished skin (or at least, that's what it feels like). If you're a sensitive skin girl or guy, this one might be worth a try. * This is the only moisturizer I will use for my face. I have always suffered from severely dry skin and this stuff has made my skin feel and look amazing! I love applying this at nighttime after all of my other skincare products. You do have to be careful with the amount you use, because this stuff is thick!! Being as you only have to use a little of the product, the amount you get in this container is more than enough to last you at least a year (if only using on your face). I would however only recommend this at night and not under makeup. I feel like it is too heavy of a moisturizer to sit well under makeup. * This product is advertised as clean but the 2nd ingredient is petrolatum!! That is infuriating when people who care and/or have health issues & concerns. I've had people argue with me in the past that there's ""nothing wrong with petrolatum"" and even ""it's healthy""! To those people I encourage you to look it up & let that sink in!.Seriously, I'm not asking you to - gasp - read a book, but Google this nasty stuff! ok"

I washed my face, put a different moisturizer on and was just fine. Sorry but not sorry—this went in the trash. * I read the description and automatically wanted to try it.

No residue on my hands.  My face feels hydrated and soft all day long.  Would highly recommend and I plan to re-purchase for next summer!  (I need something heavier for winter months as I have very dry skin). * I enjoy this product - I feel like it does moisturize my face, and I love how it makes my skin feel. However, I feel like it could be just a little better. I find I need to use more than one pump, and I don't understand why I should need to use that much moisturizer. It does work, though.

I cannot stress this enough, I have tried soo many moisturizers and I really like this one a lot. * moisturizing but doesn't sit well under sunscreen or foundation...pills up. * I bought this because of all the positive reviews but man I am disappointed… I liked the feeling of the product itself but it did not moisturize my skin and burned when applying it.

Very happy to say my skin did not redden and the dryness is pretty much gone.  I also really like the smell.  Has a spa smell in my opinion.  However, I would prefer to not apply perfumes products to my face, so would greatly appreciate a fragrance-free version.  Actually surprised the fragrance hasn't caused irritation.  The other thing I wish for is more product for the price.  The packaging is quite large and heavy, but upon opening, you realize there is little product compared to the size of the container.  Despite the fragrance, which again - I do like - and the amount of product for the money, I'm definitely going to continue using this Elemis product. * I absolutely love this product and make my skin feel amazing.   I have used so many, but nothing compares to this face cream. * I found this product 3 years ago while in the Caribbean; so excited to see it available at Ulta. * I really like the texture and smell of this cream. Not sure how effective the spf 30 is as I really haven't worn it outdoors much. Found out they use this line on Disney cruises so makes it feel more special. It's definitely a splurge but I like it a lot. * I have been using this awhile now, followed a recommendation by now and gen blog, and she has flawless skin. I love that this has spf, it's not greasy or oily and my skin is SO soft. Have turned so many friends onto it, it's truly awesome.

The thing i have noticed however is that the moisture doesnt last as long as i would like. I usually wear it to bed and i understand it can rub off but i also have the tatcha one and that one lasts me till the following day. This one however is really light and does not feel thick. Its great under makeup and a little goes a long way. I would repurchase this for a third time! My skin can be very sensitive and this has given me no bad reactions whatsoever. I would jush be careful to not leave the cap off! * This product is amazing. It is the only moisturizer that I have found that truly makes my skin feel moisturized.

Its a beautiful combonation!! Has definitely helped with my rough patches! * I love that it isn't viral so its always in stock. Amazing moisturizer especially during the winter * I love this product!! I have very dry skin and it helps so much. I does take a longer than normal time to absorb but i still love it!

I think it's a little too thick for me for a day cream (I also live in a humid area), but it's perfect for nighttime. I use the CosRX snail mucin with a cold quartz roller, then my retinol, then this. * Ive been struggling with eczema my whole life.

Now, it contains mineral oil and has done nothing to help my body breakouts - in fact I feel more greasy and more broken out than before!

Smashbox makes a much better mattifier (IMO) and I'll stick with that * Feels nice but doesn't mattify, especially after wearing for several hours * I have used many SPF products and this is far the best one ! Leaves my face feeling smooth and not oily , can't wait to buy more soon !! * Put this on your face in the morning, show yourself some TLC and enjoy a cup of coffee and relax for five minutes, then go put your makeup on. If you don't wait to apply your make up until the spf dries a bit, it ends up rolling together and making patches with your makeup. If you do wait, I personally feel the results are worth it - very smooth application and it looks nice all day. * Excellent cream to prevent shine for those special occasions or photo shoots. A staple in my makeup kit. * Im not sure why this SPF has so many bad reviews. I honestly love it for my oily skin. Ive tried so many sunscreens on the market and nothing compair to this one. This doesnt give me that super dewy look or makes me oily. Never going back this is my holy grail sunscreen!"

This moistizer is a holy grail in winter for keeping my skin consistently hydrated. I have oily skin thay tends to be dehydrated, as well as senstitive acne prone. Doesnt break me out at all * a little goes a long way. I also use it on my eye area. I have dry skin, in the winter it is upsetting how dry my skin gets. this moisturizer saved me from tears. I tried to get a lighter lotion for the summer time but was not happy when I wasn't getting the same amount of moisture so now I use this year round, just a SMALL dab. the price point and product result get 5 stars. * I spent hundreds of dollars on big name skin care but when I went to a new girl to do my facial, she recommended this brand and I absolutely love it. My skin feels silky, smooth. * This product left my face an oily mess. After putting it on I felt like my skin couldn't breathe! * I previously used the original Natural Moisturizing Factors moisturizer but it never fully got the job done for my skin. This one completely locks in moisture and my skin doesn't immediately suck it up and revert back to dry. I feel dewy but not greasy. I haven't had any issues using it under makeup either. * This product is so thick and greasy. Leaves your skin looking shiny all day. I have oily skin so while using this I had lots of breakouts. Do not recommend if you have oily skin. Super disappointed! * I have severely dry skin like I drink enough water so I was trying to find a product that would actually make me feel hydrated on the surface of my skin. Phytoceramides is the only ingredient that actually makes me feel hydrated on the top. I know other moisturizers that do it's job under the surface but sadly my skin doesn't really feel it. I will say this is more of a night time moisturizer. As for makeup I just usually put a thin layer of aquaphor under my makeup and it does the job. I recommend this to anyone who needs surface hydration on their skin."

Dry my skin. Is a mediocre product. * I wish I could afford the day cream in this brand with the sun protection SPF. But I could only afford one product so I chose this one and I'm glad I did. It's an incredible night cream. I wake up with the softest face and skin. * I was lucky to get this 50% off during Ulta sale. The more I use it the more I like it. I think its a great morning cream and it rivals the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Youth cream. It does well under makeup. Its also good for my dry skin without it being too oily for day time. I would like to try the one with SPF. * I bought this during the sale at 50% off. I think its a perfect cream for dry or combo skin. It doesn't leave my skin too greasy, but rather hydrated. * I recieved a little sample packet of this cream in an order. My skin isn't very sensitive, so I always try out samples. Nice way to discover new products!

After using this product, I had to double check to make sure I wasn't using a cream cleanser. The frangrance threw me off; It smells heavily of soap to me. Like bar soap. I wouldn't perchance this for myself, because I feel like I need to rinse off. However, I love the consistency and would like it very much if it didnt have that soapy smell. :/ * I want to love it bevause its so moisturizing but its very heavily perfumed and makes me breakout * As a person with ""mature"" skin I am happy to revisit this product. I tried it several years ago and it was too much for my skin but these days it is perfect. It's works well under make up and I also use it at night over serums."

She really likes the Inside Out branded moisturizer from this line and I thought this would be a good addition. She has no allergies and never reacts to products. She used this and almost immediately said it started to burn! We washed off quickly but it caused her face to become extremely flushed and hot. 
Read the ingredients and found it contains cinnamon bark extract!!! Why in the world would there be cinnamon in a MOISTURIZER Marketed towards youths?!? I would have never even thought to read the ingredients on a hydrating product for ingredients that burn. Needless to say we will be returning! * having sensitive acne prone skin makes it hard trying new products, but i'm so glad i listened to the reviews! this mask leaves your skin so smooth and hydrated and it didn't break me out! highly recommend coming from a licensed esthetician :) * I have only used this once because I was borrowing it from a freind and it's one of the best things that has ever gone on my face. Three days after using my face is still amazingly soft. Would most definitely recommend. * I haven't had a ton of opportunities to test this product, but so far, its not bad! It is a bit expensive, but not as expensive as some of the rest. This is a great mask overall! * It's so refreshing and moisturizing omg literally when it sokes in all of your face is so smooth no bumps no nothing you need to buy this it's a little pricy I know but it works * I love it so much it really helps alot and my skin is nice and clean in the morning"

It was helpful when I had some breakouts in clearing them in a timely manner, but other than that, nothing. I decided to branch out recently and try another retinol product from a different brand, and I'm realizing what I've been missing out on, and at a lower price point! Overall, I don't hate it, but it really did nothing for my skin. * I love it! I have a combination skin. My t zone always gets oily with white heads. I started using it last year and it really helped clear and brightened up my face. I continue to use it since it keeps white heads away and oiliness at bay. * Love the way it leaves my skin feeling.  I wasn't going to try but had to check it out.  And it was definitely worth my gold coins. * Smaller than the free samples it came with * It is a strong product that must be used as directed. If used properly it will reveal a brighter, better looking skin. * No negative side effects even using it overnight. But I noticed absolutely no difference in my skin after 2 months. It's way too expensive to not show any improvements. * I love this product (this skincare line period). I havent been dissatisfied yet but im always sad when my bottle runs out. My only con is that its pricey but I feel like its worth it and my skin agrees. If I could only afford one thing I would hands down buy this. I recommend using at night because its not really all that lightweight but doesnt cause me to breakout. I can also mix with moisturizer from the same brand (or different) and it does not affect the performance"

My face is slightly sticky after applying, but that eventually goes away. I'm on my 3rd bottle now, and my skin tone is more even and brighter from using this moisturizer every morning. I LOVE it. * Got samples of this and the vitamin c serum and despite it being brightening, it pills like crazy and made me look like an oil slick. Save your money!! * The tackiness goes away after awhile. Despite that, I love it! It also helped clear out my skin! * I have been using this product every morning for almost a month now and i can say i have seen some brightness of my skin hyperpigmentation i always make sure to follow up with a sunscreen so thats i can see results faster so far so good 👍🏽 * Yes yes yes!! So many pros and positives to this, I use it AM and PM. Love it so much! * I love all of Dermalogica products. This is like a mix of a cream serum compound to me but a cream texture. I have a tiny face and it takes two pumps to get the adequate amount I need for my face and neck. It dries on the skin very quickly but not dries like you cant feel it, dries like you can't spread it. So you have to get it everywhere you want quickly. Then it is very tacky so it should be the last thing you apply. If you apply anything afterwards you will get pilling. All that being said it does wonders for my skin. Leaves my skin glowing and fresh after i use it. It plumps it up and helps my pores as well skin texture. Its an amazing vitC face product. I find it hard to fall in love with vitC skincare products but always want to have one in my regimen. This has been the only one that truly does everything it promises to do. It does have some cons but i just dont use it on days I'm planning on wearing makeup. If you are a daily makeup wearer id recommend using it either hours before or in the evening. You get a good amount for the price. Its got a nice dispenser. Overall i give 5 stars cause not everything can be completely perfect in every aspect but if you get what you want from it can you really be upset."

This is the best moisturizer that i have found and trust me… I have tried too many. My only complaint is that the product is inside a bag inside the bottle and the top doesn't screw off so i feel like im waisti g product when its two empty to pump and I can't access the insode to scrape out the remaining moisturizer. * I switched to this from the blue bottle and im so glad. It absorbs well, softens skin, and doesnt leave skin greasy or tacky. I would buy a big bottle of this. I wish it werent so expensive. * I was looking for something that might be better than the Cerave lotion I was using for a long time that had parabens in it. My skin is sensitive and lots of things tend to irritate or break me out. Nothing changed but this lotion. I don't know what's in it that did it, but I immediately started breaking out. It claims to be for sensitive skin, but I'll take the parabens over that. And they've recently taken them out. So I won't be using this lotion. * This is not gentle whatsover!!! It smells like paint thinner and Shea butter not in a good way either.. I was lit up like a red tomatoe.. horrible horrible .. stay away its not for sensitive skin.. adding cheap ingredients and hiking up prices is what most everyone is doing now days.  Nothing is of any quality only for profits.  It's already a super small bottle for a high price tag now its not even worth using if it manages the barrier too.. ughhh * I have severe rosacea and am on the hunt for an affordable moisturizer.  I currently use environ super moisturiser but it is costly. 
I bought this La Roche posay moisturizer and it burned immediately. 
my skin is still recovering as this caused my rosacea to flare up.
I guess I'm still searching for my perfect affordable moisturizer. * Literally the only moisturizer that has put my rosacea at ease. Only downside is it is quite expensive for such a small bottle. * I have dry skin that can be sensitive to ingredients in moisturizers. I use two pumps of this on my face, twice a day after cleansing and serum. I apply serum to damp skin, let it soak in, then apply the moisturizer. Out of several sensitive skin moisturizers I tried so far, this is the only one that never makes me itchy or red. My skin is less flaky and inflamed than usual this winter so I think this is working for me and I will repurchase. It seems to layer well with other products and makeup."

I love how it's an AM/PM moisturizer. It's hydrating but not heavy on the skin compared to other rich creamy moisturizer. I like how it's an affordable price! * The Byoma Rich Cream Moisturizer has quickly become a must-have in my skincare routine! Its texture is thick and creamy without feeling too heavy, making it perfect for locking in moisture and leaving my skin soft and hydrated all day. My skin tends to feel dry, especially during colder months, and this moisturizer has been a game-changer in keeping my face comfortable and balanced. * Offered by Byoma: This product works so well for my dry/combo skin! I love that it can be used day/night and my glow is definitely still present in the morning and throughout the entire day. compact packaging is great too! * I was gifted by Byoma. I love this product! I use it on my body when I'm going through bad dry spells. Also with the weather change this has come in handy very much so! I have sensitive skin and it also doesn't seem to cause any break outs * Bakuchiol while safe for sensitive skin, it stimulates cell turnover as a gentler option to Retinol. So I have a hunch most people are using this daily if not 2x a day which I would def not recommend - that would explain all of the reviews highlighting breakouts. Start slow & steady, test patch & see how your skin reacts first. I enjoy this moisturizer & while it's hydrating at application, it does feel like it dries down pretty quickly after. I don't use it daily, but it's a good PM moisturizer option under an oil for improving skin texture and plumping. (gifted by Byoma in exchange for honest review) * Truly have liked all the byoma products I've tried but this is definitely one of my favs! Thick enough for my dry skin but not too heavy. It's not greasy and absorbs well which I love. I also love that it's unscented. The packaging could be improved tho! Gifted by byoma"

I have very sensitive skin so I've given it three days between uses. I usually put it on right before bed but tonight I had a couple hours and touched my face and this stuff pills like crazy. That's my only complaint, though * I wanted to love this,  but the chemical smell i can't do. Also, i dont like the fact its recommended to use at night only. I want a moisturizer that works for both day and night personally. Going back to true belief aqua bomb. * I usually don't leave reviews, but this cream is everything! I've been using it for several months now but I noticed a difference in my skin within the same week. I have very oily VERY acne prone skin with some scarring, and since I've been using this cream I've had minimal break outs which is a huge deal for me. I alternate it with Dime's blue facial oil and my skin has seriously never looked this good. I can't rave about this product and Dime skincare enough, this cream is a must-have!!! * Ulta gifted me this cream and i have to say im impressed!!

I'm 52 but still get oily in my T-Zone. I am surprised by the negative reviews. Its a winner in my book * I wouldn't recommend this product for women in their late 20s-30s. Its more meant for women in their 40-50s I believe. It was too harsh on my skin. Made my cheeks have a red pigmentmentation and sometimes burned. I dont use it everyday because of it which is ashame because of the price. * I received a Clarins set as a bonus with purchase.  I first tried this products.  The fragtance is so strong snd overwhelming thst my eyes became irritated.  I am not usually sensitive to anything.  Clarins, you do. It beed to add this much fragrance.  I am afraid it might keep me from sleeping. * I used the old formulation and loved it very much. But this new formulation is heavy and makes my face feel greasy. Plus it's making me break out big-time with  large cyst like acne that I've only ever gotten from cheaper brand moisturizers. will be returning... * I was in love with the previous formula,  but this one isn't the same.

They will happily apply and re-apply this like any other moisturizer. My husband also doesnt mind reapply this even at work. I took my most recent jug on a bachelorette trip and we all left glowing without sunburning. * Really happy with this sunscreen so far! Usually my least favorite part about sunscreen is how oily and greasy I feel and look, but this one dries/absorbs really nicely so I do not look like I am shining/oily from the sunscreen layer.  I also haven't had any issues with staining on clothes, which I have had issues with other sunscreens. * This sunscreen is fantastic! Unlike most sunscreens, this one doesn't have a white cast and it doesn't feel sticky. It's expensive but definitely worth the price. * If this product ever gets discontinued, I will never smile again. Supergoop Play is god tier. No white cast, doesn't slip around/get in eyes, etc. It prevents hyperpigmentation very effectively. Long story short, best sunscreen I have ever used. * I like to travel with this sunscreen.

I'm assuming it has a lot more water than the last time I've used it, which is annoying enough but it's really hard to apply now because it immediately starts running off of my fingertip * its just so good, hydrates and leaves my skin so soft without being too heavy. its perfect !!!! * I've been using this for a month now and so far, I'm loving it! It's got clean ingredients and hasn't caused any breakouts on my oily / dry combination skin. * I personally prefer this over the cosrx snail musin moisturizer. To be honest it's all up to ones preference. Neither of these products are bad, they're just made for different people. I find that this lotion paste like texture isn't too heavy, yet it doesn't absorb too fast. Compared to the cosrx snail musin moisturizer, which has a gel texture and absorbs too fast. My skin sucks it up super fast, and it's left with no benefits. In comparasent, the peach slices moisturizer leaves my skin soft and smooth. I keep on wanting to touch my face lol. I have oily skin, and I've worn this during the day. It's not horribly heavy to the point it interacts bad with my face oils. I feel as if my t zone has been pretty tame ever since I started using this product. * I use adapelene so my skin easily gets sensitive and when it does every moisturizer (CeraVe, Vanicream, Kiehl's) leaves a burning feeling EXCEPT this one. The texture isn't as luxurious as Kiehl's, but it still spreads easily and sinks in well. Fellow dry skin folks will likely need additional hydrating layers because it's not that moisturizing alone. But for the price and reliability, it's an awesome product! I think it's the centella in it that really helps my skin * I'm here after trying COSRX Snail Mucin moisturizer which just was not thick enough.  I dont see/feel the snail musin in this product, BUT I got the even skin tone that all my favorite products have managed.  I like that instead of a pot its in a tub which is more roadtrip/camping packable.  I didnt have to use an essence with this product. It felt and smelt like Glycerin or similar to E.L.F. fragrance free Holy Hydration so more basic ingrediants but still in a CeraVe/Bubble/BYOMA kind of bracket thats not ALL basic.  Would recommend for a basic, non-harsh beginning or repeat kind of product user. This and CeraVe's Skin Renewal Night Cream are a goooooood combo. * This really isn't impressing me at all. For this price point, I'd rather go to other comparable brands, like Fourth Ray. The consistency is...sort of like a cheap lotion. When I apply this, I don't really feel like it 'absorbs' great. Will not repurchase."

Firstly, it's a gel and not a cream and that should have been my first clue. It applied it and while it went on smooth, that was not the ending result. My face feels like I'm wearing a mask of sorts and my skin does not feel hydrated at all. It feels like a dry cast and during these often dry fall/winter months this is NOT what I need for my skin. 0/10 would not recommend. * works well for my combo skin in the summer.  makes my skin look healthy and hydrated and not oily which i love. the only con is that it is a little sticky on the face, but it's not super bothersome. * This is the best moisturizer for those with oily skin! I work in a hospital and this is the only moisturizer that has been able to keep my oil at bay to reduce breakouts without drying out my skin. It probably wouldn't work for those with normal and dry skin. I do have normal patches around my eyes so I use the Derma-E Skin Restore Advanced Peptides at night. Together, these are a dream team for those who want beautifully moisturized but not too oily skin that work in a hospital!

I use Derma-E Acne Deep Pore Cleansing face cleanser, The Ordinary's niacinamide serum, and this moisturizer for day time plus the Derma-E moisturizer mentioned above at night time. With this combo, I have minimal acne only around where hospital masks, hairnets, etc touch. * terrible for dry skin-it made me feel even drier after application. 
pills under makeup-my lightweight foundation looked awful when paired with this moisturizer.
It also made my face red and I was very aware of it, if that makes sense. I couldn't wait to wash it off. 
I gave it to my husband who has oily skin and he seems to be having better luck. * Very moisturizing and makes my skin feel so hydrated * I live in a very humid place and dont want a thick moisturizer. This one is perfect! I notice a difference in one day that my skin feels softer and smoother and I think it really does repair the skin barrier quickly! My acne spots seem less red and the strength of my skin overall seems better! * the only complaint I would have is that it leaves a tight, dry feeling to your face"

It so moisturizing my skin, smells so good, and feel good on skin! * The texture is very watery and gel like snd jist slides around and is very sticky. Dont like it. Wouldnt even use it on the rest of my legs like i do with face products i dont like lol. 

My husband also tried it, hated it. Thought it would be a good dupe but it wasnt * It's very affordable and works very nicely! * I absolutely love this moisturizer. I prefer gel to cream moisturizers, they work better for my oily skin. * I've never had dry skin before, more like combo to oily. I added this and the triple bounce serum to my skin routine and changed nothing else. I had actual dry patches on my face! Never in my life have I had dry patches of skin on my face. Normally I'm trying to get rid of the oiliness. I'm so disappointed as I really like elf products, but man this is like spreading water on your skin. * I repurchased this Moisterizer because it was the only moisturizer than cleared my skin a year ago, but It burnt so so badly and the fragrance cancels out all the potential hydration, it will dry ur face out and make ur skin feel very tight. So you can use this if ur barrier is in good shape but if not like me atm do NOT use it because your face will burn and turn red! * Left my skin feeling cool and moisturized but the feeling didnt last. The product felt almost sticky on my skin as it dried down. I bought this hoping it was somewhat similar to the clinique moisture surge but a more affordable option and i was very wrong. I really wanted to love it."

Omg! What a difference. The redness in my cheeks and by the corners of my nose went away. And my skin looked immediately brighter. The feel of the creme itself is SO luxurious and you only need a little bit so it will last a longer time (of course we want that with this price lol) * I love this product and ordered it online for a mother's day gift. However, I somehow got a refill, so it came in a plastic container with a tear-away foil cover and no jar. I didn't even know refills existed for this. I didn't have a container to place it in (other than using a cheap Ziploc bag), so it would have dried out. Hence, I had to return it. I'm not sure if others have had this issue, but Ulta, please be aware! * Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo my mom is a dermatologist and she loves it!!!!!!!! * I have been using this cream for about a month and a half. It feels pleasant and smells beautiful, but does not live up to its claims in my experience. My face does not feel fully hydrated by the end of the day, never mind 24 hours. I have not witnessed brightening or firming. A big selling point (and likely excuse for the huge price tag) is the Grand Rose extract, which Lancôme does a poor job explaining the benefit of. Luckily I had Ulta points to use on this cream, and not my own money. I got roped into the illusion of grandeur and prestige with this Absolue cream. Don't be like me. Much more effective and affordable creams are available on the market. Research ingredients; rose extract offers unremarkable and lackluster benefits. Perhaps the Pro-Xylane and shea butter can, but certainly not in this formulation. * This product is amazing! Expensive as heck but amazing. I originally tried this as a sample and noticed a difference from just the sample. My skin has NEVER felt so soft and smooth! Make sure to purchase when there's a 20% off code otherwise it's a lot. * Most say ""it softens the skin""  Goodness ladies, you can ""soften skin"" with products that are free of chemicals and work to soften.. A cream at this ridiculous price should do more than ""SOFTEN"".. I received a teeny tiny sample of it .. Sorry I don't believe one can see any difference whatsoever with 4 drops of a cream with a strong perfume smell.  I have sensitive skin and perfume is not something I want in a cream * Got sample with other Lancôme product. Best moisturizer on market. Cant tell u how many compliments I have received. I know it's pricey but worth every cent !!"

It's a nice weight without feeling heavy or greasy. Light, pleasant scent. I use it after washing my face at night. Provides ample moisture and skin smoothing and plumping overnight. * Hi Everyone!

So, I very rarely write reviews but this product deserves one. I've been using this product for a little over a week now and it's saved my skin. A little bit about me and my skin concerns: I'm 38, latina with tan skin, no wrinkles but a few fine lines around the corners of my lips. I struggle with eczema on my eyebrows, around my nose and chin. When I started using this cream, I had been dealing with a flare up that was into its 2nd week. 😫 I applied this the same night that I picked it up. Immediately, I noticed the lemony scent and silky feel on my skin. I had no stinging or burning. The next morning, MY FACE WAS CLEAR. No patches, no angry flare up. My skin was glowing and supple. It's been very hot in NJ and I've even used this twice a day with no adverse reaction. My skin looks so much better and that makes me happy. Thank you fresh for this amazing product. I love it. 🩷 * I really wanted to like this, as I tried the lotus day cream in the past and loved it! This time, I got this in the gift set from Ulta (the one you get with minimum purchase), and I am happy I didn't purchase the full size. The cream has a nice texture and smell but it made me break out terribly!!! I definitely wouldn't recommend to sensitive acne prone skin people. Very disappointing. * I have years using this cream. Ordered new one, when I applied it I did noticed the smell was different, I thought was expired. Looks like lots of customers are complaining about a formula changed ? So sad, now I have to find a replacement brand. * This became my new favorite lotion so quick! Super moisturizing but feels light still. Has the best smell ever (not too strong). Highly recommend! * i made the mistake of not doing a patch test. my face broke out from this really bad. it also has a weird strong fruity fragrance?? * Personally its clogging for me. My skin doesnt react to dimethicone well in larger quantities. Been loving this as an eye cream though, the antioxidants and skin firming has been a pro in the morning."

It never irritating my sensitive skin and actually felt soothing. It took hours to ansorb into my skin and left a slightly greasy feel. I awoke this morning to very happy skin - hydrated, smooth, plump and slightly firmer. Once my current moisturizer is empty, I'll be purchasing. * This is my second time repurchasing. I hate the price but this has made a significant difference in my skin. I have sensitive dry skin and this has given my skin the moisture it needs and an amazing glow. I see others are complaining about it being ""greasy"" i havent had that issue. I apply two pumps to my skin and it gives me the most beautiful glow. I use everything Dermalogica and constantly get compliments on my skin. * This is one of those products that's been life changing in my routine. The way my under eyes look & feels from this product is phenomenal. This has helped with my fine lines and wrinkles. Helped firm my under eyes. Super rich lux formula. A little goes a long way. It awakens my under eyes. * I need moisture, not grease.  So sad. I will be going back to my Drunk Elephant. * Oooof..big fan of Dermalogica but not of this. Leaves an awful oily residue and film on skin; running, not walking to return. * Does not absorb well. Face remains shiny and the product just sits on your skin. I did not see a reduction in wrinkles and I used it for almost 3 months 2x/day. * I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review~

Absolutely fantastic! I've been using this dual-phase anti-aging firming serum for a few weeks now and I'm truly impressed. The combination of CAMU CAMU, hyaluronic acid, and green coffee bean extract has worked wonders on my skin. Not only does it feel firmer, but the fine lines and wrinkles are noticeably reduced. The texture is light and non-greasy, making it a pleasure to use. I highly recommend this serum to anyone looking for an effective anti-aging solution."

I tried Peach Slices' Oil Free Moisturizer (this product) but it hydrate my skin enough. I'm guessing it's the actives I'm using. I felt like no matter how much I slathered on, my skin was still dry. Also pilled with my other products. This moisturizer was also very runny.

I ended up switching to, and am currently using, Acure 12 Hour moisturizer. * i really wanted to love this product, especially because its oil-free (which my acne-prone/combo/sensitive skin seems to prefer) but every time i use this, i get breakouts everywhere. ive tried using it daily, thinking maybe my skin needs to adjust to it, still it breaks me out and my skin hasnt seemed to calm down or get used to it. i use the matching toner from this brand and i really love that product, but i think this moisturizer is not for me. * I live in Denver, co. It gets so dry here and so far this has been the best cleanser for me! Even when I forget the moisturizer. My face doesn't immediately flake up. It's very gentle on the skin too. It has really help bring out the texture of my skin. * This was my literal go to moisturizer but they freaking had to re formulated it. This moisturizer before was a game changer.

This moisturizer before was a game changer. Really sad dont understand why brands does it when the products hits a bit popularity * Worked out really great. I was nervous my skin would be oily the next morning but didnt experience any of that. Skin feels so smooth and moistrated without feeling icky! * Tried a sample size and liked it enough to purchase the full size. Unfortunately it's not for me. It was fine at first, even though it made my skin feel tacky. After about a week of use, I noticed that my face would turn red (similar to a heavy workout flush) after applying."

It's not greasy and has a very nice feel! * I wanted to try something different and this just wasn't for me.  It's very greasy and doesn't absorb and it made me itch terribly * I'd give it 5 stars if the price went a bit lower. I aways have to wait for a coupon to come, its expensive for a bit over an ounce. I've been wearing this for a good 5 years and when i run out, my face shows! It leaves my face looking younger , pores aren't as big, fine lines are gone, and my face is so smooth. I have combination skin.I can tell the recipe has changed I think the quality went down a bit , but still good results.  Please bring the price down

-a faithful customer- * I tend to avoid creams that have fragrence in this and this one tends to sting over cuts & dry skin in very fresh states. Other than that I love the feeling of the lotion once applies (I have a mini fridge for my cream) but I just don't appreciate that feeling around sensitive skin cells. * I am so disappointed in the formula change :( I ordered a new jar and knew immediately after rubbing it on that something was off. It's almost soapy and doesn't seem to rub in like before. It leaves a bit of white residue too. I've been loyal to this moisturizer for so many years. My skin is not doing well and I'm worried I've developed a bit of an allergic reaction which is actually how I originally came to find this moisturizer. I am so saddened to have to now search for another moisturizer when my skin doesn't do well with most creams. This used to feel luxurious and almost silky. Not anymore! * The cloud-like texture and hydrating feel of this makes the youth preserve moisturizer my go-to for perfect daytime moisture that lasts until it's night routine time"

I've noticed it does indeed peel, however. 

My biggest complaint is the container, a few days after purchase it fell off my vanity and onto the floor and I noticed the jar had cracked, but not broken. 

Then last night I closed the lid on the jar and it had shattered. I got teeny tiny glass splinters in my fingers from cleaning up the mess and had to toss the jar which had half of the product still left. 

Glass jars aren't necessarily classy or luxurious, I don't understand why brands decided to use cheap glass for containers for products they know are going on a shelf or in a make up bag.

Its also THD Ascorbate. * nice * I am a redhead with freckles and sun/age spots. I bought this cream to use on ny face both for the SPF and to fade freckles. My skin had some sensitivity issues a couple weeks after I started using the product - redness, small blisters and peeling. It might've been this product, might not, but i still have not recovered. Waited too long to return it and so I started using on my neck and chest without issues. I wear a lot of V-neck tops, and noticed my freckles and dark spots faded surprisingly quickly! I'm not sure if I will buy it again, but it DOES work. On the downside it has an unpleasant citrus scent. Im not usually bothered by scents but I'm not fond of this one. * Left my skin greasy and shiny but did not moisturize my skin. Would not recommend to use, did not see any improvement in my skin just felt like putting oily sun screen on my face. * I was excited to try this product since it is a moisturizer with sunscreen but after 2 uses it made me break out. Also I noticed it made my skin feel greasy. Will be returning it. * I love this moisturizer. I have been using it for 2 over years, I will always use it. I read some reviews saying their eyes burned and about the smell. I have very sensitive skin and have had zero issues. I love the light scent it has. My face drinks up this moisturizer. My skin looks and feels amazing when I use it. Everyone's skin is different, but I love this product and highly recommend it!"

A little goes such a long way. I have pretty sensitive/combination skin. * Received a GWP sample from Ulta.

Opened to use and it has blooms of mold spores!

Yikes.

The product was never opened and never used. Promptly went into the trash * I got this as a freevie and thank God it was a freebie. 0/10. If by dewy they mean greasy, then yes! I have normal-sometimes dry skin and I used it on a ""dryer"" day, it felt really gross and warm on my face. Very similar to vaseline. Thick and very difficult to wash hands after. Oil stains on my wash towel. I didn't have the red and blotchy allergic reactions like a lot of the other receiws, but this is glorified vaseline."

Solution: Fix the pump. * Thus burned my skin. I tried in with my skin care route and alone and no matter what way i used it it burned my skin. * I was shocked to see all the positive reviews on this product because I had a very awful and painful experience. Before I go on, I want to state that I have combo skin. So, I got a sample from Ulta. I'm so glad it was a sample and I didn't waste my money on it. I just washed my face, and I applied the product on my face. The texture of it feels very siliconey. Imminently after applying the product, I got an all over tingly sensation. I read on the packaging that slight tingling may occur while the formula activates, so I left it on. However, it didn't go away. It went from a tingling sensation to actually burning. It burned so bad that I actually had to go wash my face again. Afterwards, I was left with a lot of red irritation. * This literally feels like you are rubbing pure silicone under your eyes. Also this product lasted 3 days then turned into a runny greasy oil that you can barely use. It gave me bad painful bumps under my eyes and makes my eyes water more than anything else i've used. Overall one of worst skincare products I have ever used! * I will be getting this soon I have heard good things * Worked great at first now the pump only dispenses oil and ikts cery greasy and i dont think it does much * Using this consistently the last 3 months I've noticed the biggest difference. The texture and tone of my skin has improved greatly and my dark spots and fine lines have improved as well. Just bought mu second bottle. Lasts so long and I use jt every night.

It was a total disappointment. * loved the way it made my skin feel

Also my husband always gives me compliments when he kisses my cheek because he loves the clean fresh scent of this cream. * I use several Avene products. I sometimes can't wait for this step in my skincare routine. I just love how good it feels going on.  It locks in moisture without feeling oily, too thick or too heavy. * This gel moisturizer seeps into the skin nicely, a little goes a long way. I have eczema, when it was super raw this did sting a little. The baby powder smell is OK, didn't bother me and I didn't love it either. This gentle yet effective for dry skin days. I love that it's non-comodogenic, for reference I have oily/dry combo skin that is acne prone. * I wish this product was fragrance free. It has a very strong baby powder fragrance. The product itself works beautifully but the fragrance is so strong I can't use it."

I feel so much more confident as a 24 yo in my aging skin. Gentle and effective. Love avene products! Just the best * Let me start off saying I really DO like this! I have 36yo DRY skin and I was getting a little peeling and dry patches from my Rx Tret. once a week, but had zero irritation using this every night! It's a pretty thick cream consistency so not the easiest to spread on its own IMO. I like to use a serum before this Retrinal .5% to help it glide on the skin easier. One pump usually does it, but sometimes I add just a tiny bit more if I feel like I didn't get even coverage. It's definitely a long term product so don't expect immediate results. I DO wish Ulta carried the 1.0 version of this instead of just the .5%. * I just bought this product and I am loving it. I can't speak on results yet but as someone with oily/acne prone  skin, I feel like I finally found an anti-aging product that absorbs well and doesn't break me out. It may feel slightly ""heavy"" at first but it absorbs. Great for sensitive skin, as well! So happy I found this brand * I tried a couple of retinal creams, and had breakouts and/or burning. Having used many Avene products with great results, I took their skin quiz online, and this product was recommended. It is a great alternative to retinol, at a very low dosage so you can start to build use. I've had great success with it, and it is helping with fine lines around my eyes. I can use it every night with absolutely no irritation."

I ordered the moisturizer and it is not the same at all. My face started stinging and itching after the second use and it doesnt go on as smooth. * i loved this product for so long, but didnt realize that it what was breaking me out. i tried a different cleanser, added an exfoliater etc. NOTHING would get rid of the harsh bumps all over my face. not until i researched and found out it had safflower it in which (can) support fungal acne. i have dry, sensitive acneic skin so this may work for others but definitely not for me. very disappointed and wish i found out sooner. not even 3 days after stopping this product, my skin is clearing up. * I used to be a big fan of the Superscreen Daily Moisturizer, and although they kept the packaging the same, they changed the formula and the name to Superscreen Hydrating Daily Cream. I think brands should be more transparent about informing their customers that they're actually buying a different product than what they're used to. The consistency of the new cream is thicker and harder to spread, but what stands out the most to me is the smell: somewhere in between Play-Doh and generic baby sunscreen. My partner has sensitive skin around his eyes, and the old formula didn't cause him any burning, but the new one does. I wouldn't buy this again. * I bought this because it had avobenzone but no octocrylene (at the time). Great texture but I reacted badly to something in it. Guessing it was the algae because I've used the other ingredients before without issue. * DO NOT BUY new formula is horrible. Not the same product whatsoever. Why ruin a great product everyone loved?? Makes no sense. Ive gone through at least 10 of these moisturizers and now i will no longer purchase. And the new scent is a crime against humanity. * This used to be SOOOO awesome.  Now my face oily by 10 am and feels very irritated.  Also broke me out for the first time in a while.  Had zero issues with the old formula.  I really hope they change it back * What a great and rich sunscreen! The texture of this is super rich and hydrating while feeling so comfortable on my skin.

This new formula is simply horrible. It dries out my skin, makes it irritated, and leaves a weird greasy film. It pills like crazy and makes my skin horrible. I miss the old formula! It was perfect and always made my skin feel plump and soft. I swtiched to a higher end brand which is working now how this old neutrogena formula used to. Im incredibly disappointed in neutrogena and this product. * I used this product once and my skin immediately turned bright red and started burning/ felt hot. I washed my face immediately but the redness and irritation lingered. I came to the reviews to see if other people shared this problem and I was shocked to read so many people had the same reaction.

I also wonder if this product formulation is incorrect and needs to be recalled if this many people are reacting poorly. * I have sensitive and dry skin. The old formula was really soothing and hydrating. Now whenever I use it my face begins to burn and turn red. I do not think I have seen so much irritation in my face and neck ever. * I have worn the hydroboost creme (not water gel) for years. This new formula feels more oily than the old and I have to almost scoop it out and use more than the old formula. It doesn't have the same texture and smoothness. It just isn't the same. Also, much smaller container for same or more cost. So disappointed in this new formula. Really hope they will bring back the gel creme. * Love the texture and I was hoping it would be a suitable new nighttime moisturizer for me however my face breaks out when I use it. I will go back to what works for me (Cerave PM.) * Tried many products that irritated my skin. Thought I'd try this one even though it is targeted to younger skin.

I LOVE IT!!! It blends GREAT (especially for a product with SPF), isn't greasy, doesn't make my skin oily or shiny, has not caused a breakout, and I can see a clear difference in the moisture level of my skin in just a few days. Anti-aging creams normally make my skin totally freak out, but this one is all good, no bad. Really glad I happened upon it! * This contains Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene....FYI * I joke that this is my old lady face cream because it smells like a bouquet of roses. However, it really does give the skin a lifted appearance and tightened feel. The daytime version has some SPF and wears nice under makeup. I wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin because of the fragrance. Also, I noticed on very dry winter days the product does not have enough moisture for my skin * I received this as a sample size from Estee Lauder and I can't wait to buy a full size. This is why I love samples, It lets me fiind out what I love without spending a fortune first.  It has the faintest fragrance that is subtle but lovely. It goes on so smooth and is just pleasant to use. My only complaint is the price. Some of us would buy this brand more often if we weren't priced out of the market. This is why I gave it a four. Otherwise, a five all the way. * This smells like febreeze and it doesn't go away when you rub it in :( save your monies * I use this product daily.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. It did not irritate my skin, which can sometimes be an issue for me.  Makeup base glides on smoothly over this moisturizer.

I have found it hard to put on my tinted sunscreen it makes it go on weird. I wouldn't recommend or buy again. * This cream smelled like straight wet paint and had the consistency of it too. I tried to get past it and used it a couple times but it wasnt worth it. The cream made my face peel and more oily. * This is such a hyped product and has fantastic ingredients but it's not for me. It's the weirdest texture, super liquidy but thick? It reminds me of the GAK made in elementary school with cornstarch & water. There's also no way that I could use this during the day.

It's very hydrating too! Can't speak much for wrinkles but it makes my skin look healthier! * For the price point, I was disappointed in the moisture this product provided. I only purchased it to try it out because it was on sale but I would not repurchase and I would not buy full price. It also smells weird, I know fresh typically uses fragrance in their products but it doesn't smell great. * I''ve used this cream for 2 weeks and think it's a keeper. * I havent used it long enough to know if it works. The smell is so offputting i dont want to use it * The product has a very nice consistency and feels great on my face.  It is too soon to tell if it makes a difference but I really like it so far * I have been using for about 2 weeks now 4 times a week and I am not super in love.

I have sensitive combination skin and I always struggled to find a product that didnt give me that greasy glow. 

This product is light yet hydrating enough that it doesnt require a lot of product. While the price tad is high, the big container last me 2-3 months depending on the weather. 

I would recommend you get a sampler size and try it out for 3 months because you wont see any instant results. After 6 months of using this product, it cleared my blackhead and slowly seeing results in other areas. * I have been using this multi corrective face cream since its arrived on the market, Im 52, it has been a game changer since i traded up from their daily moisturizer( in which i stared at 30. It doing what it needs to do, im not getting wrinkles or dry skin and i use it alone & under make up. I'm often asked if im 35 so i have to give some credit to kehls for it. I love the line, its fine quality and i will never waver! * I bought this after many great reviews. I used it around 10 times and thought it was sunburn because I was red and sore. I switched to e45 then another brand and I was fine. I then tried it again after a couple of weeks and it stung my face again! I usually don't have sensitive skin and I'm gutted I spent so much and now can't use it * Every single thing on my face 'balls up' when I use this moisturizer, including when I use it alone.  It does not absorb into my skin, but just sits on top. I've tried it in so many combinations and it's just incompatible with other skin care and foundations (I've tried several foundations -high end & low end- with same results).  I've also tried using it with serums, different primers, different sunscreens and alone with the same result. This is a hard pass for me. * In my early adulthood i had terrible acne and skin probs. I tried proactive and everything at the drugstore, nothing worked. I found Kiehl's and my skin turned right around and I've never had a problem since. Im willing to pay for good skin care, but this price still hurts. My skin would feel waxy and really greasy for a long time which aggravated my pores, which in turn aggravated me. It doesnt feel moisturizing at all. I feel like i just wasted a lot of money. Kiehl's let me down for the first time : ( * It goes on creamy and smoothly, and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks so good. Been using this and all Kiehls products for many years. * This was extremely irritating to my skin. It started to burn and little pimples developed. I had to wash it off immediately.

I live in a high humidity area and it works great! * After applying other serums or makeup this product began to peel off my skin. * I have cystic and acne and everytning makes me break out but this didn't. I wouldn't say it helped my acne any, but i didn't break out bad and that's what i'm looking for :) the pump is awful though, barely works, wish it came in a different container. * i love this product but most of the bottle is air and only filled around halfway with the product. it is a wonderful product to help ease your acne but you definitely need to be willing to pay a lot for it and the select amount that you will get from the bottle * After two or three uses my entire face became red where I had applied it. Cannot figure out which ingredient i would be allergic to. Put Cortizone and neosporin all over my face to calm it down. * Just seemed it wasn't worth the money. It didn't last all that long.

It makes me look so pale. I am so surprised given the price and the fact it is supposed to be a ""daily moisturizer."" Would not waste your money. * I loved the fact that it had hyaluronic acid and SPF in one, but after putting it on, I realize it's definitely not for me. I hoped the reviews were wrong, but it definitely leaves a white cast over your skin, and made me look super pale, despite the fact that I have a fair, medium skin tone. * I have tried almost every mineral sunscreen under the sun. I'm fair skin, freckles, burn easily, break out easily and this sunscreen moisturizer has been amazing. There is a white cast initially but I rub the product between my fingers before applying and it blends within 5 minutes! I never get sunburn on my face while wearing this. I also apply a ceramide barrier serum beforehand and do not experience any dryness while using this product. Would absolutely purchase a cool toned tinted version of this. * I like this sunscreen for days inside where im not too worried about reapplying. This sunscreen feels great on the skin once rubbed in, but its a workout to do so. I'd give this more stars if it wasnt so hard to rub in, which is why i use it on days I'm inside. It also gives a slight white cast but it does go away quickly. Otherwise, it's very moisturizing and doesnt feel tight on my dry skin even if i forget moisturizer underneath."

Sadly, I have do go on another quest to find another moisturizer that works for my skin. * NO WAY. IT'S THE SMALL CONTAINER FOR $1 LESS THAN 1.7 OZ.
Don't buy this size at this price. Look around * V happy with this! I was super p.o about them changing the formula of the Hydroboost Extra Dry gel (now the Hydroboost water cream) I was using because it's the only thing that worked for me. That one has *horrid* reviews now about being too heavy and acne causing. This is perfect and I would consider it the same product as the old one I liked. Glad I went with this instead of the other one. I have dry, sensitive skin and this moisturized and kept me smooth with no breakouts. * I wanted to like this, but I miss the old formula/extra dry gel cream. The old cream was like a drink for my face and my skin looked amazing. This new formula feels sticky and oily. I do not like it and hate when companies change something that isn't messed up.

Gives my face a fresh glow and moisture during this cold weather. I'm not sure if it would be great in the summer. The only issue is that you must dry your skin thoroughly. For some odd reason the texture of the cream changes if there's a hint of water on the skin. * I have very dry skin, and have tried and used over 50 face moisturizers, and this is one of the worst ones. It is SO thick and does not sink into the skin, it feels like its just sitting on top of your skin almost like sunscreen. I REALLY wanted to give it a fair try so I tried it as an overnight moisturizer, and when I woke up my skin did not feel moisturized. * I wanted to try this because it's made with clean ingredients, and ended up being disappointed by it. It left my face feeling oily in some places, and sticky all over. * I absolutely adore this moisturizer! I started using it a year or two ago and I've gone through multiple jars. It's lightweight and the texture is amazing. Starts off as a cream but then it disperses and feels like water on your skin. It leaves your skin so hydrated and dewy looking! * My favorite moisturizer so far ! If you have DRY skin thos moisturizer is a life saver & its clean ingredients ! I have sensitive skin as well and this moisturizer has never gave me any problems ! Love it ! * I wanted to try Honest for its ""clean ingredients"" so i got the little trio kit, this cream came in it. It smells nice and does go from feeling creamy dipping finger into the pot and then a watery feel rubbing it in my face. However, it doesnt turn lightweight like most watery-gel creams. This is still very heavy and thick, i even went back to look at the ingredient list to see if it had SPF in it. This would be great for those with dry skin, but if you have oily skin and want something like the moisture bomb gel cream, this isnt it. To me, the name is a little misleading. * I have struggled FOREVER finding a good moisturizer. I have extremely acne prone skin, and a ton of moisturizers break me out or give me fungal acne. I use this in the morning since its a lightweight moisturizer and it leaves my skin feeling nice but not greasy. I have combination skin, it used to be more oily before I started going to a dermatologist and was put on a topical that tends to dry me out. I do prefer a thicker moisturizer at night, but I will continue purchasing this one over and over!"

This does not moisturize and is more of a thick green paste that makes your make up look bad too. Yikes * This lotion is ok. I realized after buying and using that la roche posay is not a cruelty free line. Will never repurchase. * I've been using this product for about two weeks and noticed a difference with my redness but recently got a slight sunburn which it does not help for. * At first I was skeptical about this product due to the reviews but I just went ahead and tried it anyways after trying it I realized this is a good product for when I do not feel like wearing make up especially because I do have acne scars but the only fall down is I've tried other products that are green and they are supposed to correct redness and they have worked better than this product this product is not as full coverage as other products I have used in the past but I would still purchase this product"

Unlike the cleanser which is light, smells great and leaves skin feeling fresh, this moisturizer is thick, feels heavy on your face, and smells like artificial fruit. Also, the pump is terrible. * This moisturizer is absolutely amazing! My face is so soft and hydrated, I couldn't believe it. The smell is light and fruity. I'm so happy I gave it a try. * Though I do love the way this lotion feels on my skin, I won't purchase this again unless the packaging changes. It feels cheap and only works about 2/3 of the time.

Anyway, I can wear this sunscreen alone. Makes my skin glow so I feel comfortable skipping foundation 😌 * This is my first time working with an spf moisturizer, and honestly I think it does fine. I have oily + acne prone skin so moisturizers are a hit or miss, my only problem with this is that it does take a bit longer to absorb than I would like, but once it sinks in it's perfectly fine. * This is my first time trying these products.

It does take a good amount of product to treat the redness and it pills easily. Ive tried not using it and ive noticed my acne spots are healing much faster without it. So it may take care of the redness but messes up the skin texture and gives me acne * Im not the biggest fan of face makeup so i thought this would be a great 2 in 1 to cover and heal any blemishes. Tried it and absolutely fell in love. This product has been so good to me. The tint can be a lil dark or light for some skin tones but as nuetral/yellow olive tone its been awesome! * This. This stuff right here. I have already told so many people about this stuff! I have lots of redness and therefore I NEVER leave the house without foundation on. I can easily wear this and this alone! It completely cancels out all my redness! Im currently on my 3rd tube because I love it so much! * Great product for those who don't feel like wearing makeup but have days that they want to feel more put together! * The pros about this product is that it will cover your redness. The con is actually applying it. When applying this product, you ABSOLUTELY NEED to blend it out well. If you don't it will leave your skin with a green tint, and it will also be very obvious you have it on because the texture will be visible. I would definitely practice with it before you go out in it! * I could not get this to work initially, but kept coming back to try.  I think that losing my summer tan helped.  This does reduce redness!  Great for a minimal makeup day or spot correction under foundation. Purchased a 2nd tube."

I pair this with a peptide eye cream & it has diminished my fine lines * In lieu of my 5 star rating, this product sadly ended up in my ""can't use"" category. I absolutely loved EVERYTHING about the whole Propolis line, but unforturnately Propolis is an allergen tested during an allergy patch test and mine showed a trace reaction which my allergist informed me to avoid any allergens even if it is only a trace. This could be an issue for people who have sensitive skin. I have to say that other than being a possible irritant or allergy to some, this moisturizer is a really great consistency and lives up to all the expectations that it claims to have. As with any product that is new to your skin, proceed with caution and do a patch test. Its worth knowing :) * I love the toner and serum in this line but for whatever reason this lotion is just waaay too much for me. It would irritate my exzema and cause small/minor breakouts. I have dry/reactive/acne prone skin so moisturizers are a challenge for me * My skin loves it! My pores look smooth, its calming & hydrating without looking greasy. A little goes a long way. * I LOVE THIS! My skin took around a week to really settle into this as my face reacts to new things. However once i got into the routine of using this, my pores look smooth, my skin is plump, and is overall hydrating without looking greasy. It also calms down the redness I have on my cheeks. A little goes a long way. I finally found a moisturizer that works for me."

The texture is light and fluffy, yet it delivers intense hydration that lasts all day. My skin feels softer and smoother, and it's perfect for my drier skin without feeling greasy. It's also gentle enough for sensitive skin, leaving a healthy, nourished glow. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a moisturizing cream that really works! * The cream is very good and up to now is working good, I need to keep trying the cream for a linger time. * I have tried endless products that either feel like they sit on top of the skin or completely disappear in a second yet my skin still feels like dry. This is hands down the best moisturizer I have used for my extremely dry skin type. I use it every night and I can tell a huge difference. * This gave me blackheads and acne that I haven't had since high school * I wanted a heavier moisturizer for nighttime, a noncomedogenic and vegan product. this one was okay, didnt have a weird smell, absorbed fine, but i didnt notice much of a difference while using this. Fyi i have combination skin, in my mid twenties. * I got this product to help me restore my damaged skin barrier never again. This brought back the acne i've been trying to heal for so long. DO NOT BUY THIS IF UR ACNE PRONE!!!! My skin has never been worse using this product. * Got this when it was on sale because I needed something for my dehydrated sensitive skin. This was not moisturizing enough for me. My skin felt dry and tight by the afternoon. I was using the Kopari peptide glow cream (which you cant buy from ulta anymore.) my skin really liked that one gave a nice glow and my skin felt hydrated all day."

Hard pass. * the product is great! the packaging is horrible. the lid crumbles and cracks and white flakes end up all over my hand and inside the lotion and then all over my face. * you need this in your collection! * MAC liquid makeup is great.

Wish I could afford to keep it in stock. * This eye gel is part of my every day beauty routine. A little goes a long way. It's very soothing and moisturizing. It does not settle in pores and it does not pill. I use it before I put on my tinted moisturizer. * Refreshing light citrus scent, cool on the skin, moisturizes without feeling heavy or greasy. * I was looking for cheaper dupe to the 100hr moisture surge from clinique and this was the only other moisturizer that has caffine in it. But the smell was too strong. Says theres essential oil inside but i never break out but i did. Go pay the extra 10 or get moisturizer surge. Also blackfriday and other holidays it goes on sale * I received a sample of this product in a big sample kit and decided to try it out. I had been using The Ordinary Niacinamide + Zinc for the longest time and after trying out the sample there is no going back for me. I had no idea but The Ordinary was causing breakouts which cleared up in a matter of days once switching to this. It makes my skin feel refreshed almost immediately and my skin looks brighter and plumper after just 30 minutes. Normally heavily fragrant products make me break out and cause my face to burn due to my sensitive skin but I have not had this issue at all with this product. It is a refreshing citrus smell which I absolutely LOVE the smell of citrus. After long time use my skin consistently looked brighter and I had less dry skin and fine lines. It is true that it does leave your skin feeling sticky but I always put my moisturizer on top of it and the stickiness is no longer an issue. I highly recommend this product!! * This moisturizer has really leveled up the radiance of my face. I use this as my night cream, and ive been waking up to increasibgly refreshed and energetic skin with each passing day. * My skin has never felt so soft. I also use the scrub so the combination is making my skin look younger and softer!"

I would not recommend if you have dry skin or a damaged skin barrier. My face felt
tight no matter how much i put. * I have dry/sensative skin. I wanted a thicker mouturizer for winter. This product caused me to have an eczema flair up around my eyes. Even though it says safe for sensitive skin, do not use this if you have eczema. * This moisturizer made my face bright red and burn so bad! I had to wash it off and use good old CereVe to stop the burning! Do not use this if you have sensitive skin, i seriousky do bot recommend! * I have bought this 4 times now and that says a lot because I usually try different products each time. I love how it calms my skin and I actually really like the smell. This will be a forever product for me. * I've been using Peach & Lily for over a year now and have yet to find a product line with such wonderful ingredients. P&L formulations really do make a difference, especially the textures and overall experience. I've learned the hard way, even if the ingredients are good, if the formulation isn't one you look forward to putting on, it's easier to skip skincare when in a rush getting ready, which obviously over time means diminished positive impact on the skin. I thought I'd try this moisturizer to see how it compared to the pro-peptide firming moisturizer I use daily. This is the first P&L product I've used that was a total fail! The smell is just aweful as other reviews have said. I thought maybe it was just a bad batch the other reviwers received, but whatever it is, the smell is like an overwhelming plastic/rancid smell and I'm sitting here writing this wanting to get the moisturizer off my face ASAP, despite it feeling pretty hydrating. The glass skin refining serum, ginger oil cleanser, face polisher, and especially the peptide-pro firming moisturizer are not just great, they're exceptional, and either have no smell, or a light more natural scent. Overall, don't waste your time and the shipping on this one! * This product has veen a game changer for me! It gas significantly reduced fhe redness in my skin and has helped my PCOS acne immensely! A little bit goes a long way with this product and is the perfect addition to my skincare routine. * I was recently upsold this when I went in to repurchase the moisturizers I usually use, the Peach Slices Snail Rescue and Redness Relief lines (wonderful products) and at first I thought this felt nice when applying but I've found that it doesn't absorb into my skin and I HATE the way I can feel it sitting on top of my skin for hours. Not only does it not absorb but my skin doesn't feel hydrated or moisturized. Extremely lacklustre product for the price. The smell is also not pleasant but not unpleasant…I'm not sure how to describe it, I would just prefer it not smell that way."

It has a really nice smell without being strong. The only thing I don't like is that it's a bit pricey for the quantity. * They changed the formula and the smell is completely different. I used to love this product because it smelled like a spa. The new formula also does not feel as rich on the skin. This will be my last bottle. Too pricey and it is near impossible to get the last 1/4 of the product out of the jar, * I purchased this cream and overnight cream for my face along with the body lotion ..WELL
They all smell the same overnight and Day facial cream is the same to me 
I spent over $100.00 on two facial products are the same .
won't buy it again * Lightweight, smells great and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. * Ok seriously Ive tried thousands of products over the yeara because i have sensitive ans acne prone skin! Ive been using this every day sometimes twice a day if i rememebr and its kept my skin CLEAR!! Even with the return of rhe mask mandate at work its protected my skin from my ""maskne"" ive had theoughout the pandemic. Would definetlt recomend this. This trial ive used this alone for about a month and a half. * I got a free sample of this product. It is NOT fragrance free. I immediately had to wash my face * This is a really good product for my combination skin. Vey matte and leaves no oily residue. However, they need to change the bottle on this product.

I tried it in the colder dry months and makes my skin feel  hydrated. * I had been use this product over 20 years 
It worked very good on my skin. * This is marketed for normal-dry skin but I have combo-oily and my skin drinks this! Also not marketed for my age range (20s), but if you're looking to splurge, this is it! I bought it on a whim as a Beauty Steal and I would absolutely buy it again. It's super hydrating but lightweight, not greasy, great for sensitive skin, and leaves me with a healthy glow! This moisturizer has helped to smooth my skin especially as I'm dealing with breakouts - gives me better glass skin than some Asian beauty products that claim to do so. Love love love! * A light moisturizer that delivers maximum hydration.  I have always had good results from Clarins products. * This could be a great prduct if they took out the nasty fragrance. It's so bad and lingers on my skin for hours. When I use this one, my cat won't come near me and cowers if I try to oet him. That should tell you how bad the smell of this is. * Buy it. * Never used any face product that is this much perfumed. Thinking about return."

I got a sample of this cream ans love how my skin feels ans looks when i use it. The price is exorbitant and is the only thing keeping me from making it my usual night cream (i work in retail so it takea half a shift to pay for it). I'll jusy have to watch for sales! * I bought the collagen cream to replace collagen masks. I am very pleased with the results after just a few days. After cleansing and toning, I massage a small amount into my skin. I allow it to dry completly and then use Philosohy Miracle Worker face cream over top of it. This gives me smooth, glass skin all day. My skin texture has markedly improved since adding the collagen cream. It is key to properly massage the collagen cream in and letting it dry before adding the second cream. I do not wear makeup, so I cannot speak to how it would layer. * I was really excited to try this and after a few weeks notice no results. * Leaves my skin soft. Will repurchase * I blend this with the  prayer Thomas water drench sheet tint moisturizer. Blends great! Firms my skin and doesn't feel greasy or heavy.  I use this as a foundation.  Quite  expensive for the combo… but it works great with make up or just as a tinted moisturizer with mascara. * This is a great product and feels good on my skin, but I can't use it like other moisture products before applying my foundation because of pilling.. I now use only at night so I'm not putting anything over it. * I like it. I also drink collagen supplements so i think it works pretty well on top if it. Im only 23 so i dont have wrinkles to begin with but i will say that its pretty sticky going on and if you touch your face while its trying to dry than you will get the 'beads' like everyone else is saying but if you dont touch your face until its fully dry it will look normal"

Wish they'd reformulate it so I could go back to using it again. * I personally wasn't a fan of this product. First I want to point out the sales associates at Ulta are super sexist to men and I got passed multiple times every time I asked for help literally ignored me. But back to this product, it's very similar to sun screen I prefer a thicker face lotion like the 2-1 face & beard but that got discontinued. * After years of using Vasaline Intensive Care lotion on his face, I convinced him to try the Clinique For Men Broad Spectrum SPF21 Moisturizer.  He loved it!  For a lotion with sun scree, it's not greasy and  it absorbs into the skin nicely leaving no residue. * If you've ever had a reaction to a sunscreen this one probably contains your culprit. Wore once and broke out in a rash/hives where it was applied. I will now be avoiding oxybenzone. * Applied it at the store to test it out and also bought some, a few hours later had a giant bump on my chin. Going to rerun it tomorrow. * This is the only product my husband doesn't seem to have a skin reaction to. He has oily, sensitive skin. * My husband, who usually hates skin care products, is obsessed with this Clinique moisturizer.

I put it on overnight after my moisturizer as much as my pointer finger and I woke up the next day, my breakouts worse so I just stopped using it right then and there kind of disappointed was hoping for good results.🥺 * I love how it feels on my skin and i think it would add hydration to my skin. * My daughter tried the face wash and this gel and her face had a terrible reaction. No, no new foods or other items. She immediately began burning. Her face is like this on both sides and she has never had sensitive reaction to any other product. * I have dry, but clear skin. However, summertime + makeup = sweaty breakouts. So to stay on top of it, I started using this product once daily during my nighttime routine. Started working in just a few days of use. Now, instead of having several problem areas after a full day of wearing a full face of  makeup and sweating, I maybe have just small baby blemish that resolves itself overnight. It also does not dry out my skin more than it already is, if anything my skin has been feeling softer and more hydrated. I use La Roche Posay double repair moisturizer and it works well alongside it. With how well this has worked for me, I'm excited to try more products from them.

Disappointed. * My skin felt angrier after applying. Tried a few times. Returning. * My skin is very sensitive- i have mild rosacea and can be prone to breakouts. This didnt make my skin burn or break me out, but it didnt improve my redness at all. It's a nice basic moisturizer and i appreciate that its not heavy, but it doesn't actually reduce redness. It can be hard finding things that dont actively irritate my skin though, so if you need a good basic moisturizer for sensitive skin this is a good choice just don't expect to drastically reduce redness. * I use the Peach & Lily Matcha Moisturizer for redness but it's expensive so I thought I'd try this one. It is very heavy on my skin and made me feel greasy. I didn't notice an immediate change like I did with Peach & Lily's. I might just suck it up and pay extra. * Looked this product up online during a rosacea outbreak. I've never had such quick relief from a product. Not only is my redness gone within 24 to 48 hours and a major difference, but also the dryness and scaliness has gone down tremendously.  As someone who has suffered from 18 years old with this issue and now almost 30, it is one of the best products I have EVER used. A little goes a long way and I definitely recommend this to anyone with redness or rosacea. * I really lovr peach sliced snd wantedcto love this because my face gets red in certain areas. I just couldn't find one thing i liked. The product was really liquidy which was okay but it left a weird residue on my face afterward. I dont have very oily skin but it made me feel very oily and greasy. The smell was pretty bad too, i found myself having to put better smelling products over it to cancel out the smell. And i dont mean i want a fragranced product, because i used unscented products to cover up how weird it smelled. It also didnt do much for redness. It crusted over along the rim of the packaging and got really gross. I wanted to like this but i really didnt. :( * I want to like this but it's just too sticky.

Like the hourglass powder! * It's not an awful looking product compared to some mineral sunscreens but it's enough to make me want to try a better product for my skin. * I am a big fan of the Vanicream Moisturizer and Bar Soap for my sensitive skin, so I decided to give the SPF a shot. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this specific product from the brand. It has that very strong sunscreen smell & automatically burned my eyes. It is very thick & has a heavy white/blue cast that wont go away no matter how much you rub it in. I gave light skin and noticed the white cast, so I'm sure its way worse for medium-dark skin tones. It is sticky and leaves an oily finish. This isnt a product that can be worn under makeup easily without seperation. If you're looking for a sensitive skin sunscreen that you can slap on your face while at the beach & dont have sensitive eyes, then this might be okay. However, compared to Korean sunscreen I've tried, this one cannot compete."

I have very dry and mature skin and generally need a very thick moisturizer so, thus one surprised me!  It's super light, absorbs very quickly and keeps my skin moisturized all night. * One of the best moisturizers ive used and ive used quite a few. I honestly it better then even the more expensive, better reviewed competitors (like Tatcha or Glow Recipe). The smell is strong but it works really well and makes my skin glow and feel good. * lightweight, not too glowy , easy to layer with sunscreens * I was advised to try this instead of more makeup to cover red areas on my skin. It worked immediately and just zapped my dry skin issues. My friend, who has suffered from Excema for years saw her redness and itchy skin gone within days. * Came back to do a review update because I'm on bottle 3 of this gem right now and I figured most reviews are done after a couple uses or a week of use. I like to read reviews after extensive use of a product. Okay so after bottle #2 I decided to branch out and try something new (I know we all do it!) so after almost 3 mths of using something else my face lacked it's glow and some of my hyperpigmentation returned around my cheeks and upper lip. I had managed to clear almost all of it up while using this! Stupidly I fell for a video of a different product and switched to it. I just went out and bought this again and already my face feels softer again and I know my hyperpigmentation will decrease again! I won't make that mistake again! This formula does not contain dimethicone which is important to me, I don't want a fake softness to my skin, I want a nourished softness. This is light and silky going on and even with dehydrated, dry skin I can skip a top moisturizer most days. The light smell goes away within seconds and does not bother me at all - strong botanical smells cause a migraine- lucky me! This is not a gel it is more like a serum texture or a light lotion texture, it sinks in pretty quickly. The bottle is glass and beautiful on my countertop, plus pump bottles are way more sanitary than droppers or jars. I appreciate a good pump bottle because I know when something comes with a spatula I'm using my fingers after about a week and a dropper always ends up touching my face or not sucking up enough product so I get mad at it! Come on beauty industry there is nothing wrong with a pump dispenser! Take note!!! I highly recommend this product and pray Lancome doesn't ever discontinue it! 
So if you have uneven tone, hyperpigmentation, dry and or dehydrated skin, aging skin, and dislike dimethicone you may love this formula!"

It  makes skin brighter, soft, and silky. My fine lines at my mouth already look better. I had been using a retinoid based cream but it was burning my skin, not this stuff though. It's a bit pricey but I highly recommend it! * I've used Clinique all my life, at 76 I never thought it would reck my skin like it did! Red patches all over my face! * love how this makes my skin feel comfortable and plumped hydrated skin. never felt better * I've tried numerous skincare products over the years, but the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair line stands out like nothing else. The potency of the formula is remarkable, and the speed at which I noticed results was truly amazing. Within a short period, my skin felt smoother, firmer, and more rejuvenated. It's evident that this product is designed with high-quality ingredients that actually work. If you're looking for something that delivers visible results quickly, I highly recommend giving this a try! * I use this product along with the wrinkle reducing serum and feel that this combination has been very beneficial to my skin, which looks far younger than my age. * I have used the Smart Night line for years. I always went back to it and my skin looked great. I don't know what they did to this product, but it has made by skin break out with a terrible allergic reaction. This formula is NO good. I will be returning this. * It's a great product but after using for a week I thought it was my allergies then I realized it was this cream I was putting on my face. Yes I recommend it but I'm allergic to it."

This moisturizer is fantastic to use at night! I sometimes add a rich moisturizer over it in the winter, but it's good by itself the rest of the year. I wake up with no redness! Love this stuff :) * This is way too heavy and greasy. Not sure if it's trying to be a primer, it's not even a sunscreen, it's not really a moisturizer, you can't really layer makeup on top, and it's too heavy to wear at night? I don't understand this product at all and I wore it for like 6+ months and nothing worked. I wish I could get my money back * Feels very greasy, even with a dry skin type this felt awful on my skin. * There are so many peach slices products that I love, but this isn't one of them. I'm quite shocked at how bad this is. I'm pale and this tint was worse than just a yellow tinge. I was orange, like bad spray tan orange. The product separates easily and needs to be shaken vigorously to mix. It did little in the way to actually moisturize. Instead, I looked shinier than ever on top of having a couple of dry spots. Which is confusing. Dry spots are foreign to me as I have oily skin. I would not suggest this moisturizer to anyone no matter the skin type or color. It just isn't worth it. * I have rosacea so I've tried a ton of products like this one. It may have been three worst. It didn't work and just sat on top of my skin. I tried it with and without moisturizer, no change. Disappointed her again. * I am fair skinned with a neutral undertone. This was way too dark and orangey. The texture and finish is greasy. I expected it to be dewy and light coverage. But it felt slimy and looked blotchy whether I applied it with my fingers or a brush. Also, the ingredients separate, so you must shake it before using. Otherwise, watery liquid pours out. The smell is also sort of weird. I wish it had a redeeming quality."

Needed to wssh my face and back to my normal hydrating serums and moisturizers. 
Item was returned * This product (I didn't use anything else in my skincare routine) made my skin super irritated, inflamed, red, sensitive, covered in bumps, and itchy, like I've never seen before. My eyelids are also very swollen & it's hard to see. It's been a few days and my face still looks scary and burns every time I wash it and try to put any fragrance free lotion on. Not sure what ingredient in this product I am allergic to. I have used many (stronger) vitamin C products over the years and had never had any issues. I do enjoy other products from this brand though. * I would give this zero stars if i could. It burned my skin so badly I immediately had to wash it off. * i wanted to love this product, i love the FAB cleaners but this moisturizer burns my face. it may be a little bit too strong for my face, even though it says for sensitive skin. * I bought this after using the SUNDAYRILEY vitamin C moisturizer because it's a little cheaper for the same amount of product.  It's very glowy but the product feels greasy and it pills so badly under my sunscreen.  I don't see myself repurchasing after it's gone. * I'm normally very sensitive to vitimam c products. the last one I used was from bliss which if I'm being honest was not horrible at all and caused the least amount of irritation/redness of any other, BUT it still caused it unfortunately. 

had kinda given up until I started using mostrizer  from First Aid beauty that I people picked up on a whim. instant love!!  so this led to seeking other products from the brand, hence this review!  
won't speak for those who had bad reactions,  NOT every product is going to work for every person!! and I've had my fair share!! this thou ,for me, has been fantastic!! no irritation ( at any point) no redness , just glowy hydrated skin! iv got combo dry leaning skin that's sensitive and this is the only vit c I've used that didn't cause me issue!! wish I had tried sooner!! * I'm 43 with combonation dry leaning skin that's sensitive... especially to products with vitimam c , they are usually way too irritating causing a lot of inflammation and redness... I picked  this up after trying other products from first aid beauty and loving the results! 

been using for about 3 Days now and no irritation or rednessi!!  this will be my go to!!"

But it seems to work its way into my eyes, and it stings for a long time. I don't think I will buy it again, but it is good enough. * Thats all jusy buy it! * purchased this due to the spf rating. I use Olay sensitive during the winter months and usually add Neutrogena SPF, but I found this product this spring and decided to try it. I absolutely love. I use serum first and then this. I absorbs nicely and doesn't leave my skin sticky. I use under my eyes and my eye lids and I do not experience any burning. I occasionally use powder foundation and it holds all day. the scent is nice and not over powering like other products. * Wanted to love this product however it burns my eyes!! * Great product. * I can only put this on about half of my face because of how incredibly badly it makes my eyes sting. Even if I take care to avoid the eye area, it creeps in them somehow. Feels nice as a moisturizer but it makes me look more sweaty/oil slick than glowy. Have to completely cover my face with setting powder for my skin to not look wet. * this product provided a good moisturizer for my skin but it left my skin oily. I used it with a hydrating serum after but I also used the moisturizer by itself and it still made my skin oily. It made my face smell like sunscreen but it helped with an initial layer of sun protection. If it wasn't so oily I would like this product."

This is just my opinion for myself. Hopefully someone else will have better results. * Goes on smooth and keeps skin plump and moisturized. * The charlotte's magic cream is amazing product.  Your face will look and feel younger smoother and with less wrinkle's. Also, using this product your foundation will go on so much smoother looking. I would highly recommend using and you will love it. * It makes my skin look and feel silky smooth. * I had seen someone use this cream on a make up tutorial to help with creasing with make up. I bought the sample size and have been using it every day for a month now and I had to buy a second one because it worked so well for moisturizing my skin for context I am in my late 30s and I have combinational skin, I do not get any breakouts from using this and it really offers a great boost and moisture. I would highly recommend it. * Purchased this product on a whim because it was near the checkout counter. I am so glad that I did. I absolutely love this moisturizer.

Highly recommend. * I have been a Pacifica user for YEARS. I trusted them as an early brand for clean beauty, when that category was much (much) smaller. While this product smelled amazing, and soaked in great...I started breaking out. I couldn't figure it out for a week!

Not only are octyl salicylate and octocrylene not reef safe, but they also break me out terribly with what feels more like a burn. Stay away, if not for yourself - for the environment. * I was very excited to find a daily moisturizer with the bonus of having sun protection. However, I don't want to smell like I'm going to the beach at work (or anywhere else for that matter). It's kinda heavy and makes your eyes water from burning. * I absolutely love this moisturizer!! It is a bit greasy but if u have dry skin this is my go to. I love the subtle smell too! I would recommend this. Just don't get it near your eyes if possible. It will burn ur eyes * it's a bit greasy even after soaking into my normal skin, and has been causing me to break out. It smells amazing and feels nice, but I really miss the Sea &C magnifying primer that was discontinued. The finish was better and didn't make me break out at all. * I don't know why I thought that maybe this time regular American chemical sunscreen actives wouldn't burn the crap out of my face. This product irritated my skin really bad. I bought the whole line and had such bad breakouts and dry skin that it took at least two months to regain even a semblance of normal skin and I only used the line for at best two weeks (but the sunscreen was only once on the face). I was using this on my chest as sunscreen until I started breaking out there too. I have had a bad reaction to nearly all of Pacifica's products and I think I'm done even trying. * The moisturizer works great and smells amazing. However, it's not the best for oily skin. I have combination oil skin and my skin gets very, very oily with this after a few hours. I gave it 4 stars just for that reason. If you have normal or dry skin, I think this would work better."

Otherwise, loved it. * Very moisturizing for this 56 yr old face. Sinks in beautifully and is perfect under makeup. Feels very luxurious.  I will continue to buy. Highly recommend. * I think for the price its not really worth it. Although it is very moisturizing, it did not last till the morning. There are so many other creams you can get for a cheaper price that are just as moisturzing or more. Id give this a 3.8 * I'm so happy that this product was included in the 21 days of beauty.

But, this lotion is sensitive enough not to irritate my skin furthermore and durable enough to lock in moisture to eliminate dryness without clogging up my pores. Happy i came across this brand because I have wasted a lot of money before finding this product. * Please never remove this. It's the only moisturizer I've ever been able to use without triggering my acne!! I never have any product related breakouts anymore!! Finding a good moisturizer that worked for my skin was soo hard. This is so perfect and I've been using it for probably a year now. * I use retinol and aha products regularly so every now and then my skin peels and gets red and sensitive. I have tried a lot of soothing and calming products on the market to fix my occasionally irritated skin but so far this one is the only one that doesn't hurt when applied and that actually calms my skin down. I have used both its cream and balm version. They are both great but I like the balm one a little better. * Glides onto the skin nicely and leaves a nice hydrated finish to the skin. Very soothing for dryness without clogging pores * In recent years i've developed excema on my eyelids, chin & ear lobes. I've tried so many moisturizers that claim to help reduce redness and lock in moisture, but it wasn't until I found this product that my skin changed for the better. I bought the 3 pack sample with the facewash and thermal water and fell in love with all. 

First purchased back in September 2022 & still using the same 3 products today. I even tried to change back to some old products that used to work for me and my skin returned to the brittle and scaly old self that used to be. I remain consistent with this brand, and they have shown me love back, my skin soaks this stuff in and doesnt break me out whatsoever. 

Super gentle and refreshing. One of my favorite pros is that it leaves my irritated and stinging skin, smooth and calm. if you have irritated skin that stings, even when you put your moisturizer on it, this product is definitely for you and will help with that sensation. * This is my favorite Avene product! So much that I finished my first tube and bought two more! It has been very helpful for my dry face this winter and I love using it at night over my serums. * Helped razor burn and is super gentle"

I've been using it for a year and have purchased it three times now. I've only ever bought it when it's on sale, but I honestly think even at full price it would be worth it! I'm 34 with combo skin, leaning more towards oily. My skin is also flaking and peeling right now due to my prescription skincare treatment and the cold weather. This moisturizer does an excellent job keeping my skin hydrated without pilling or weighing it down, and it keeps the peeling down to a minimum, if any! Once it's absorbed, my skin looks nice and dewy instead of greasy, and I've seen improvement in both softness and texture of my skin. It does burn occasionally if I have patches that are particularly red/irritated, but the burning stops quickly and there's no irritation afterwards. The scent is light, sort of citrusy, and it doesn't linger. I use it every evening and one jar lasts me about 4-5 months. Overall I highly recommend this moisturizer! * This facial cream feels great on my skin. I use it daily to help with loss of elasticity and firmness, especially around the jawline. I really do think it's helped my 60+  yr. old skin. * This moisturizer feels amazing on my skin and so luxurious. I would buy again! * I bought this during black Friday sales and biggest regret was not buying more while on discount.

The formula feels amazing in my skin, it literally feels so luxe. And there is noticeable difference to my skin. I'm actually obsessed! * I have sensitive skin and unfortunately lots of water retention in my face due TO PCOS (moon face) I've really started to notice a difference with this product. Especially on a good night's sleep. But I love applying it before makeup. It makes my makeup so smooth looking and skin stays so soft. * Not sure why its so difficult to find this product being a travel RN, but when I can find it in store I go for it!!  My skin is so sensitive and acne prone at 32 y.o and this is the best lotion I have ever had! * This is a reslly nice moisturizer and gives a nice glow on my 43 yesr old skin"

I purchased a bag of new products including this moisturizer on the recommendation of 2 employees. I wore it for the first time on Thursday with mascara and eyeshadow. A female coworker told me, ""I hope that this doesn't get me into trouble, but your face looks so good. You have the natural glow of someone that just had a good time."" So needless to say I will wear this every day for the rest of my life. * My skin isn't the most sensitive, but it does have random triggers that cause redness and irritation. My face broke out in red irritated blotches, especially near my eyebrows. Love FAB, but this one ain't for me :( * I got this in a Boxycharm and I was SOOO excited as I LOVE things coconut-y! I tried it multiple times, with my favorite products and new products I never tried, and my skin looked oily and the makeup never seemed to sit nicely on top. It also seemed to make my pores look worse * I use this as both a primer and a normal moisturizer on no-makeup days and it makes my skin feel much more hydrated than other primers. It also has a light & pleasant smell. I will say it applies very shiny/dewy, but personally the lotion-y texture helps my tinted moisturizer blend in better when i apply it on top. * Love this primer, very light, feels very natural. I use before foundation or tinted spf. * I love first aid beauty but for some reason this leaves white spots on my face.

I prefer a slightly richer formula to nourish my skin. * I am in my late 20's and I notice my forehead was starting to have deep wrinkles and my neck was starting to form unappealing wrinkles.

I am appalled at how little product is in this HUGE jar. The exorbitant cost does not equate to how little product you actually receive. Save the planet, reduce plastic.

I will not be purchasing again. * Shocked as to how little of product waa in that jar! Tula do better! That jar wasnt even half full. So disappointing. * vitamin C is light sensitive, so the top being clear makes the product get stuck in the end of the pump and turn brown when exposed to sunlight. if it was in a totally light sensitive package it would be fine. also, the outer blue plastic ring on the top of my jar broke off, exposing more product to light. the product is fine and brightens the skin well, but i usually have to put a heavier moisturizer on top. id recommend pairing with sunscreen too. i like the shiseido one because its more oily and moisturizing on top of this. * I got this for free during a promo. I feel like it didnt moisturize well. My skin still felt dry (and my skin tends to be on the oily side) and even seemed flaky sometimes. Im glad i got it got free because it is pretty expensive. I wouldve expected it to be higher quality for the price. Also, if you put any toners or serums on before it doesnt mix well or really absord into your skin.  It turns white and takes a while to fully rub in. * I like this brand because it has good ingredients but this cream has a strange smell to it.  I want to say like a burning smell.  I prob will not purchase again. The price point is a bit high * I tried this mousturizer as a day cream and bought the white 24/7 mousturizer as a night cream. My face was covered in tiny bumps (fungal acne? Dermatitis?). Absolutelt do not recommend, it didnt even leave me moisturized. I cut out this moisturizer and the night cream separately to see which was causing problems and they both did. I stopped using the products and the bumps went away. * I used this produt for 4 days and got a rash all over my face, neck and up to my ears. I now have little bumps all over my face thats going to be a mission to get rid of."

None of them seemed to have helped but I came across this and gave it a try. 

My skin was instantly moisturized and it dulled the redness even the reduced flakiness by alot. I'm impressed and am so excited that I've finally found something that actually works. * My daughters ezcema started getting bad again and we tried this for the first time and it worked !! The itch went away the first day and the rash started getting bettwr the second day ! * I have mild eczema on my fingers along with having sensitive skin on my face, so I thought this would be a nice moisturizer to help with both problems. I've tried La Roche Posay products before, so I was under the assumption this would be another worthwhile purchase. I bought this product two days ago and both times I've used it (immediately after washing my face), it's made my skin itchy, inflamed, and red. This evening, after applying it, my skin got so itchy and red I thought I was having an allergic reaction to my sheets or to one of my makeup brushes/products, but as soon as I washed my face again, the itchiness went away. I only thought to wash my face after reading a review of someone who experienced something similar to what I did. I was even about to take allergy medicine and apply cortisone to perhaps help with the itchiness and discomfort. I would NOT recommend this product whatsoever. * I have psoriasis and eczema. Ive been flaring recently due to the extreme weather. My face has a terrible rash that hasn't subsided. My left arm was so red, dry and itchy, no oils could heal it! 

Within an hour of applying I could see and feel a difference. My face started healing and skin stopped flaking. Break outs were becoming more controlled (clogging caused by psoriasis's 10x skin growth rate). Arm stopped itching and was no longer red! 

Normally I would never use a thick cream like this for my face! It had no burning and helped soothe my skin immediately. 

Very happy with this product! Helps a lot with soothing my autoimmune disease when everything else tends to flare it (yes even from the derm at months of use of products). * Made eczema worse on my face and boyfriend's hands * I've been using this lotion for over a year now & have repurchased about 6 times! I have VERY sensitive skin, I get hives on my hands/arms, & allergies that make my face skin dry out/flake in the spring. This has worked better than expensive clinique moisturizers & has been a real life saver in my breakouts. A 'con' is that sometimes it pills on my skin, especially if I'm using the cicaplast balm too. I wish it was more product for the price & that squeeze style bottle didnt allow for so much product left inside when you can't squeeze any more out (I've cut multiple of these bottles open to get ALL the product). I'm going to branch out & try a few new eczema products but I would (& have) recommended this one to other people with eczema & still would probably purchase again. * I suffer from facial eczema and have tried a few creams.  This cream is the best for soothing and providing moisture to my face.  Highly recommend!"

I use it everyday AM and PM, and it leaves my face feeling so smooth and clean without the feeling of a heavy moisturizer. I would compare this to the belif aqua bomb, just even more lightweight. * I have sensitive skin so I was scared to try a new moisturizer. I did break out a little bit the first week (around the chin area) but after using for 2 weeks, my skin is in love !!! Super moisturizing and my skin feels great * I have very oily acne prone skin and it works very well. Not greasy at all, althpugh it is a gel. It goes on smooth and i love it. It does not have SPF so i do use an SPF after i use this. * This product absorbs quickly, but unfortunately, it caused a burning sensation on my skin upon application. It left dark spots on my skin due to burning. I couldn't put anything on for almost a week because it burned so badly. Definitely will not repurchase. I do love other products from Kiehls but this one isn't for me. * I may simply be allergic to an ingredient in this moisturizer as it has many positive reviews, but it burns every time I apply. On a more positive note, I didn't experience any additional breakouts. * In my personal experience (oily t-zone, sensitive dry cheeks) this moisturizer has been excellent. Even though its a gel texture, its shockingly soft and melts into the skin well, not getting that slight stickyness that some gel/oil-free moisturizers tend to have. Im able to use this on both the dry and oily parts of my skin and then I use their barrier repair cream on the drier/sensitive areas of my face and it feels downright refreshing. No irritation but also I dont feel like an oil slick after an hour! No greasyness but still effectively moisturizing, makinng my skin just feel supple and calm. I dont make a lot of money to buy ""luxury"" or just nicer skincare, but I will always splurge on this product as my go-to moisturizer."

And I love using the eye masks in the morning as I get ready for the day; it perks your skin and eyes right up! * The eye patches didn't do anything for the dark circles under my eyes and the moisturizer wasn't enough for the desert climate that I live in. * One of my favorite moisturizers. My eyes are very sensitive and many moisturizers, and serums cause them to burn if I use them around my face. Not these and I love the moisturizer for morning and night. * My skin is always dry even after trying other moisturizers the next day its super dry.

This product will leave your skin dry and white. even if you think you have rubbed it all in your face will still be white and if you sweat, be prepared for the worst eye burning of your life. this product needs a complete overhaul or just to be taken off the market. do not waste your money. * I love the Ultra Repair Cream, but this product was not it. It left a white cast, clumped up as I rubbed it in, and made my makeup sit poorly on my skin. My skin looked dry hours later. Better to use the cream with some other SPF layered on. * Makes my skin feel hydrated and it has spf so a bonus. * Wouldvt recommend. Leaves soim white. * Burn my eyes and it has white cast.

The fact it contains the stable form of Vitamin C that most dermatologists prefer to recommend is of course THE reason to use it. I also LOVE that they didn't add fragrance to mask the  normal smell of the vitamin C ingredient. Yes, that odd ""hot dog?"" scent is just what the vitamin C smells like, and it dissipates in less than a minute. * Bought this product about a month ago, I was worried at first about spending so much money, but it was time to drop the dime. I'll be turning 35 soon and my skin was dull, dry and sometimes had red patches that would burn when using other creams, correctors and moisturizers. 
Since using this product my skin looks just as young and fresh as it did in my 20's!
I will definitely be purchasing this again when I run out. * Started using this product about a month ago and I love how dewy and hydrated my skin looks. It has also helped with my skin tone.

Two starts only because it's moisturizing. * Gifted by Peterthomasroth. Amazing moisturizer, I love it. It leaves my skin feeling super soft and hydrated in the morning when I use it at night. The texture is really nice feeling on the skin, and almost leaves a cooling feeling to skin, which I love! It also helps making the skin look more glowy which is plus. Overall I love this!"

Lotion with spf that does not have a white cast on the skin. I love it and gives a great glow to the face * I received this sunscreen after attending their promotional walk for the launch of the product. I noticed the very next day I started getting micro bumps that resembled milia or granulomatous. I stopped wearing make up and switched to a gentle cleanser to see if those were the reasons however I remained applying the sunscreen to obviously help protect my face. To my surprise, my skin was only getting worse. It was starting to burn and itch. I've been allergy tested, and I don't have any. The day I didn't use the sunscreen, my skin condition immediately disappeared, so I went to look at the ingredients list. I don't know if Origins is using the oils from grapefruit, lemon and orange for fragrance purposes, but it does not list anywhere that they have extracted the furanocoumarins. After meeting with my dermatologist, I was advised that the citrus oils used in the sunscreen caused photosensitivity, and burned/ irritated my skin. If you are someone with darker or sensitive skin, I HIGHLY recommend AVOIDING this."

Started using this product again this week remembered why I love this! My face is becoming rehydrated again. The brightness is coming back and my rosacea is subsiding. I do have sensitive skin and this seems to do the trick to balance pH levels. If you have tried other products with no luck, try this product. Not every product fits everyone but this one is definitely worth the try. To me... worth every cent🙏 * 'My daughter is 14 and this product has been great for her acne * I love to try new products so I've experimented with a number of daily moisturizers with SPF like Drunk Elephant and Unseen Sunscreen and always come back to this Murad holy grail. It doesn't leave a white cast, is moisturizing, non-greasy, and doesn't pill under my makeup. I use this daily and a bottle lasts me roughly 4 months. I'm honestly shocked at other reviews saying they broke out as I have acne prone skin and never have but YMMV. * This is a decent sunscreen, rubs in fine and makes my skin soft. However this burns my eyes soooo bad. Obviously I know to not get sunscreen in my eyes, but it doesn't matter how carefully I put it on, my eyes burn. I have very sensitive & dry eyes and it just doesn't work. The Tula one in the yellow bottle, is the one I continue to go back too. * I was very excited to try this but was disappointed to find the results being similar to a drug store brand product not to mention this product caused my skin to break out and become oily. Never had those issues with my skin before starting to use this. Also the product just pours out of the bottle causing you to end up wasting product every time you use it which makes you run out a lot faster than you would expect. * I have heard great things about Murad so I finally decided to treat myself to this moisturizer. I wanted to love it SO bad but my skin has BLOWN UP with acne so bad, it's starting to really get to me. I used to struggle with acne but it had gotten to be almost non-existed until I bought this. At first I thought my pregnancy hormones had caused my flare up, and it could be a contributor, but this is really the only new piece of my skincare regimen and it seems like others have had the same bad experience as me too. Will be throwing it away and buying my old moisturizer. * As always, every experience can be different but I'll tell you mine: I have very sensitive skin , dry to normal, rarely have acne besides the occasional pimple. When I started using this, my face broke out like a crunch bar. TONS of bumps and several pimples. I started a new night cream at the same time so I wasn't sure, but as soon as I stopped using this my face cleared. It was pretty instant, at the end of the day the bumps were the worst and I would wash my face and wake up to no bumps (not what happens with typical acne). If you haven't heard of acne cosmetica, google it that way you can watch out for it with this product or any others. After looking closer I realized THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS SOME COMEDOGENIC INGREDIENTS (i.e. ethylhexyl palmitate)"

Im on day 2 and WOW my skin looks soooooo smooth and clear!! I noticed it got rid of my acne too!! 🥹 Love love it! Worth every peny! I used to buy the sunday riley luna sleeping night oil double the cost of this and have not seen this much improvement in such a short term like this!! * After a few days i noticed a cluster of bumps on my neck and chest area. I figured it was from something else like perfume, but then I noticed smaller bumps on my face. I don't consider my skin sensitive so i am surprised. I wish this worked out. * After having my baby, part of my postpartum recovery included extremely dry skin around my chin and T-zone area. It was SOOOOOO bad. My makeup application was the worst showing patchy skin. I tried so many things to help, including high-end luxurious products, but nothing worked until I tried this for weeks. I saw it changed the texture of my skin that included smoother and moisturized skin. I love it so much, I just bought a second one. The scent is also light. Nothing too crazy. This was good to my sensitive skin. Highly recommend!!!! * This product did make my skin feel feel and look amazing.  However, it also caused acne breakouts that I hadn't experienced in many years.  For that reason, I can't use this product.  I wasn't prone to breakouts so it was a bit surprising. * Smooth and penetrates well. Skin feels soft and smooth * Used 2 full bottles and feel very dry. Not the product for me. * The concentration of alcohol in this is too high. It will create the ""tightening"" effect but that's actually the denatured alcohol sucking water out of your skin. Avoid this at all costs."

I have normal skin. I have noticed it has helped my skin barrier and absorbs quickly, sits well under makeup, and doesn't pill for me. I do use Cocokind Vitamin C serum before using this to add a little extra moisture. However, my only con is it could be a tad more moisturizing. * I have normal/dry, acne prone, aging skin (I'm 35). I have been using this as a day moisturizer and love it. It doesn't clog my pores or cause breakouts, and it sits well under my SPF and foundation. It's hard for me to find a daytime moisturizer that is moisturizing enough without making my makeup look cakey, but this product is fantastic! It also smells really good which is a bonus. * Love this so much. Bought it on a whim in store because I need to add extra moisturizer to my routine for the upcoming winter and am on a c c u t a n e with horribly dry skin. This works more than I expected! After the first night of using it, i noticed my skin looked so plump and moisturized in the morning. No pilling, really light, soaks into the skin nicely without oily residue, and good to use all over the face/neck. Fragrance isn't anything special, light citrus-ish that goes away quikly. Wish it came in a body lotion too!!! Will buy again. * I have combination skin and i purchasd this thinking it should work well for me, but after applying it made my face and neck feel sticky. And I think the scent is too strong of a fruit loop smell.  It just smells and feels cheap. Will be returning. * the tub is a good size for the price and it feels good when initially applied, but even without using any other products it pills up after drying * comes with A LOT and it feels refreshing but it starts to pill if used with anything else * Unfortunately i do have to return it. Made my tzone super oily 20 minutes after applying it"

I have dry, very sensitive skin. When I first put this on my skin was glowing. After a few minutes it started to irritate my skin and I had to wash it off. Sadly this particular product was not for me. * I love all the Charlotte Tilbury products￼. I have the other magic cream and it's amazing. So I was very excited to try this one. I love this magic water cream. It is super soft and doesn't feel sticky. * When I use this product it feels refreshing, and cooling on my skin. I love how it's not thick or heavy, yet I notice my dry spots improving. Haven't used long enough to notice a huge difference when it comes to lines/wrinkles, but I would purchase again. I do wish they had a nicer scent though. * This is such a treat for my skin. It offers hydration without that heavy feel, and it's packed with ingredients like niacinamide and peptides, both important in my routine. Niacinamide is known for smoothing skin texture, brightening, and minimizing pores. The peptides are great for a little boost in elasticity and helps skin stay resilient, which I'm never opposed to. It also has hyaluronic acid and polyglutamic acid, a duo I love because it locks in hydration. I want to note that it's made without oils and is water based, which is a huge bonus if you're like me and tend to get that midday shine. The texture is light but still feels luxurious. It also layers really well under makeup without pilling. This cream is quite spendy, you're looking at about $30 for the travel size. Although I like this cream and its ingredients, there are other moisturizers out there that create the same result but at a more affordable price. If you have some extra money to spend and want to splurge on a luxurious cream, I'd say go for it. In my opinion it's lovely, but not a ""must have"". * I really like the design of the packaging, it's sleek cute and heavy! I like that the ingredients it has help with oil control, moisture, and reduce the look of pores. The texture goes on even, and does not leave the skin feeling greasy. I have oily skin and this fels light weight! * Anything charlotte tillbury is just magic. I have used this water cream before and a little goes a long way. I absolutely love it. It's really moisturizing and keeps your skin fabulous ! * It instantly took my skin and transformed it.  My skin was hydrated, plump from using this product.  It's a light weight cream that left my skin glow.  There is not really much of a scent."

Its too good. My makeup looks freshly applied all day long. I csnt say enough about it. * I spent alot on this and it did nothing for me. I like how the product is provided. The moisturizer itself caused skin irritation after I used appropriate face cleanser foe skin type. Not for eczema prone or sensitive skin! * The formula is fine—nothing amazing—and there are similar moisturizers at a more affordable pricepoint. I have combo sensitive skin and it didn't irritate my skin. I do really like it when i mix it with my retinol oil at night as it helps dry down the oil faster and keep in the moisture. The packaging is my favorite part with the pump top. When i'm out of this, i'll refill it with my cetaphil night cream. I got it when it was half off but i still think it's too expensive for what it is. * Ive been eyeing this product for a while but was put off by the price. I finally bought it on a whim one day and im absolutely in love! It feels so good on my face and doesnt feel  greasy! My skins appearance has overall improved as well! * This is seriously the best moistirizer ever made. Love it so much . My skin is flawless * This stuff makes my foundation look flawless!"

It's a small bottle, but, I like it! I think it lives up to it's claim: my face appears to be smoother, feels softer. * Bummer that this is now 5 mL smaller than before but costs exactly the same. * Not great for sensitive skin. I love a milky SPF for layering other products but even with a heavy moisturizer underneath it dried my skin and caused peeling and flaking * I go through sunscreen like its nothing because I tend to burn easily. This one is lightweight and comfortable. I wear it under makeup without any problems like some cause. The only downside is the price for the size youre getting, but otherwise I love this product and will be buying it again. * I love the texture and feel of this sunscreen and it doesn't cause acne for my very sensitive skin. Downside is it goes quickly and the price point is too high. * I have sensitive, dry skin. I'm newer to using sunscreen daily. I researched many brands and this had great reviews, so I bought it hoping for the best. Using it over my serums has helped them work their magic. My dark spots have eased up and my expression lines are less prominent. My skin is more hydrated and plump. I plan to keep using this because ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" and it works perfectly for me! Also, sometimes when I introduce a new product, my skin has a bad reaction (redness, irritation, breakout) and this sunscreen has not caused any negative reactions. * It is not as good as people are saying in the reviews. Yes, it blends out well but it just stays on top of your skin and leaves you with a greasy feeling. Also, for the price… definitely not worth it. I couldnt even finish the whole bottle because it was breaking me out so bad. Some people are saying its good for people with acne prone skin but as someone with acne prone skin, yeah it is not it. I gave it to a relative because i didnt want to be wasteful and even they didnt like it and theyre honestly not that picky with their skincare. Korean sunscreens are the way to go especially if youre acne prone and the prices are a lot more cheaper!"

Love it * My skin feels smooth and moistureized. * This is my night cream ever night.  It works, It does not irritate my skin. What's not to love about that? * I received a sample of this and did wear sunscreen during the day. The first night it went on everything seemed fine. It went on with no problem. The second day I felt a little tight itching? By the third day I started seeing peeling around my nose and my face felt itchy and burny. Not an overwhelming itch but enough to recognize I'm having a bad reaction. Peeling, itching and a slight burning sensation. I didn't use makeup the first two days but when I put makeup on the third day, it went on blotchy and I could see the irritation on my cheeks, mostly below my eye area. I'm Pacific Islander, NC30 and in my 40's, sadly this product is not for me. * Product is usually good. But got a bad batch and felt bad so I didn't bring it back.

It's essential for every person who need hydration and loves softer skin! * I thought this meoisturizer was a bit too thick, doesn't seem to absorb very well into skin. Won't be back, probably back to a little lricier option. * This is a nice light weight moisturizer. A little goes a long way. It's great for sensitive skin as well. * I tried the Goodlight milky toner and the facewash and thought it was good.

The ingredients really are great in all of their products. Please dont be fooled like I was. I believe the ingredients are good but the quality and purity of the ingredients may be off because I dont think my skin has ever been worse. Now I must spend months repairing my moisture barrier and getting back to glass skin. Please avoid and if I may recommend something else. The Clinique Moisture Surge overnight mask, it has saved my skin from times like this.

I love it! * I am acne-prone but need a moisturizer for skin dryness, especially during the winter when the cold wind easily dries out your skin. After using this moisturizer, I have had several instances of bad luck with getting a new pimple the next morning. The texture and application (no burning) of this product are fine. It does its job to moisturize the skin. However, not without suffering more blemishes sadly. I picked this while trying to find noncomedogenic moisturizers with clean ingredients according to Yuka, but my mom helped point out to me later this has vegetable oil in it… Cool! 🙃 * its just perfect and a little goes a long way * I dont really know what people are saying about this product, most people are saying its lightweight and non greasy but it feels so heavy, sticky, and greasy on my face, maybe just not for me but I won't be buying this again * I have sensitive skin and this works well for me. Love that it isnt too heavy on my combo/acne prone skin * I was hoping this product would work well on my acne-prone skin, but it doesn't seem to do much for me. It doesn't absorb very well into the skin so the more you use the more ends up sitting on your face. The claims about this moisturizer being pre-biotic don't seem to mean much. Hero specializes in products for acne and acne-prone skin, so I assumed this moisturizer would work well in my routine and be hydrating but I was disappointed."

If you havent tried ""frownies"" i suggest trying those. Theyre cheaper for a larger quantity and better results. * I tried these on a few spots on my face, under eyes, smile lines, and 11 lines on forehead. I honestly wouldnt bother using these under your eyes because the adhesive is so strong it pulls at your skin even with wetting them. They did work well on my smile lines and 11 lines but they just soften the wrinkles, my results only lasted about 1 week. Personally I'd invest in a good quality eye cream over using these patches. * I love this idea and if it worked it would be cool but they don't stay on - followed directions to a ""t"" and still fell off within the hour. Returned them to the store as defective * comes off if I move my face :-( * Terrible"

I like how light it is, the price point, the volume of product, the consistency, & how long the bottle lasts. Its travel - friendly and good for all skin types. * This moisturizer is great for the summer or daytime, but personally its too lightweight for my combo skin. Its more hydrating than moisturizing and has a gel like texture. I gave it to my roommate who has oily skin and she loves it * It has helped me a lot with managing my breakouts along with clarifying toner. They really are a great combo to use. All the ingredients are clean and i havent had any type of allergic reaction. Ive scanned it the bottle for acnegenic and condemenic ingredients and it had none and then i also scanned it for toxins and it had none. Overall i would recommend to anyone unless they're specifically looking for a matteifying moisturizer. This oil free moisturizer gives you a slight sheen and glow. * New favorite! This has been amazing for my combo skin. My skin stays hydrated all day long but doesn't get oily. Great as a base layer under make-up, doesn't pill. * lightweight moisturizer , made skin smooth  , I Don't Think this moisturizer won't break you out !!! * i love this moisturizer, its perfect for layering! especially for skincare routines & when applying spf and makeup * I initally didnt like this mosituriser as the birch smell is a little odd…like a tree. But i reallt liked the lightness and the way it absorbs. So ive gotten use to the scent. This is the perfect day moisturizer as its light and absorbs well. I have dry somewhat sensitive skin.

My fault but I'd literally have to hold my breath * Earlier this year my dermatologist informed me I have seborrheic dermatitis. I've been using ketoconazole shampoo which definitely helps but I still found myself needing to use cortisone cream on my face (gross!!). So I was researching moisturizers good for dermatitis and while Supermello isn't specifically marketed for dermatitis (it does list eczema) I thought it sounded like it may help. I am SO GLAD I gave it a chance!!!!! its been about 2 weeks now and my face is looking the best it's looked in several years. Patches that I thought were stubborn acne have been clearing up and are almost totally gone. the hydration level us just right so I feel moisturizes but don't get greasy as the day goes on. It does smell REALLY lovely with the light vanilla/Marshmallow aroma. Definitely worth trying if you have skin conditions that make you red/itchy! * I got this as a sample and wowww the smell is so good! It's very creamy so a little goes along way! Im so happy I got it as a sample because now Im definately buying more. I love this brand and it also makes my skin glowy and so soft. I love how my skin feels I usually use their Vitamin C then put on this cream and it leaves my skin poreless and soft. * My skin burns from water, I swear. I am incredibly sensitive to everything. My skin chaps, get red and raw, itches and burns. I have tried most of the major 'sensitive' skin moisturizers high to low end, and this is the absolute winner. Keeps my skin moisturized and smells great. I have found it does not do well under makeup so I only use at night and for the first time, thats enough moisture for me. * I've been using this moisturizer for a few years now and I LOVE it! This is the only lotion I've found that leaves me with no irritation or redness. Highly recommend! * I've gone through a couple jars of this moisturizer - it's incredibly rare to find one that truly doesn't clog my pores, and despite some highly comedogenic ingredients, this one surprisingly does not break me out at all. Also makes my skin incredibly soft. Unfortunately, however, as I continued to use this, noticed my pores becoming increasingly large and more noticeable, and my skin texture getting worse and worse. Stopped using for a few weeks (keeping everything else in my routine the same) and my  texture is looking quite a bit better. So, no go for me."

I've tried a lot of SPF and finally found one that doesn't leave me ultra shiny and oily.  I really like this product and will keep using it! Only downside is that I think some of the oils in the product settled and the last couple of uses did leave my skin somewhat shiny but other than that, my skin was left soft and even toned! * Contains harmful chemicals that damage our coral reefs. Please make smart consumer choices, this sunscreen is not environmentally safe and my face broke out when using it :( * this sunscreen gave me such a healthy glove, and my skin did not feel oily or greasy at!!!! I used to have the Laroche poosay (I hope i spelled it right) sunscreen, and it would make my skin shiny, but it all oily. I have normal skin and I really love this product. * I'm in my 30's and have always had acne prone, oily skin. A few years ago, I was able to clear up my skin with a strict morning and night routine that includes prescription creams, but every time I would try using SPF, I would immediately break out. I've tried dozens of prestige and drugstore brands! This moisturizer with SPF is the first that hasnt caused a single breakout. I've been using it for over a month now and I will continue to as long as its on shelves. * This product is okay as a moisturizer and sunscreen but leaves you shiny looking. It also does not work well under makeup at all. I learned the hard way after I was almost completely done with my makeup and it began lifting and leaving ugly peeling patches when i used a powder brush. For the price, theres way better sunscreens out there. The murad sunscreen in a blue bottle is about the same size and the same price but works amazing. * I switched to this sunscreen and my pores and oily skin were controlled also my skin felt amazing! I could t rebuy it because I was pregnant but whenever I get my hands on this again I would gladly stick to this only. The only con is the size and price"

It's so wonderful feeling. You have to experience this to believe it. My skin has become so soft and younger looking. I will definitely keep this in my beauty routine * I mean it...when I say I am nearly 30 and struggled with hormonal skin since I was 12..I have spent SO much money on skincare products, it's insane. Recently I bought a $150 moisturizer claiming it was magic, when THIS..PUR Cloud Cream (for a fraction of the price)..was all I've ever wanted and needed. It is the silkiest product and it just melts into the skin like a drink for your pores. I mix it with a dab of Charlotte Tilbury ""beautiful skin"" foundation and I feel like a million bucks. Immediate confidence boost. It's just enough tint to perfect the redness from my acne and scars...and it leaves the most gorgeous finish, like I just got back from the medspa and my skin is plump, hydrated, and GLOWING. I got this as a sample from Ulta and I had to come back here, buy the full size immediately, and leave a review. I knew nothing about it so when I searched it up I was expecting this to be much more expensive. A double win for it's attainable price!! Please never discontinue. * I am allergic to tocopherol acetate, and this is the only moisturizer I can find at Ulta without it. Thank goodness it works well. Feels nice, not greasy. Absorbs quickly, and isnt strong smelling. * This is one of the only things I can use on my face! I dont have to worry about my face sweating when
I wear it. It is lightweight and is scent free! * Okay so. I have extremely finicky, super sensitiveGr, combination skin. Ive tried lots of moisturizer brands such as Clarins, CosRx, Drunk Elephant, and Beauty Counter. As great as they worked, my skin sucked up the creams too fast and didnt last me throughout the whole day. Serums helped, but would cause me to break out in consistent trouble spots. The way it sat on my skin did NOT feel even. Rough versus smooth. And when using foundation, you could see the different textures. 

Since using Pür Cloud Cream, I can honestly say this is one of the most amazing products Ive ever tried?? 
When applying, a little is a lot. It smoothes out so evenly, feels cold and refreshing right off the bat. I let it sit about a minute or two, did a test feel of my skin. Let me tell you, the texture was IMMEDIATELY consistent over my whole face. Trouble areas such as the nose, above my lips, smile lines, and eyebrows were rich and hydrated. Im actually kind of shook how quickly, too.

When using foundation, it gave an airbrushed feel and look. My skin still felt smooth! And was definitely still hydrated. 

So excited for trying this product. Will DEFINITELY buy it again. * Lightweight and goes on smooth * Love this for my acne prone skin, it soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated. Not oily and clogged at all like some moisturizers."

I am 60 yoa and have struggled with acne and skin problems since I was a teenager.  I believe it's mostly due to bad genes because my sisters and daughter also had acne problems.

I do not look my age and I believe that using these Baremineral products contribute to my better looking skin. * I use this daily after cleansing. It is light-weight but easily covers my face & neck. It isn't oily at all. I have used other products in the past. They cause breakouts and leave my face feeling greasy all day or soak in immediately & don't create a good foundation. * Best moisture I have ever used. A little goes a long ways.

Using the whole set it's very expensive but if you are careful and use them as indicated they last.  I bought mine on October 2022 and run out of them in February 2023 bravo!!!  And that was because I had to travel to different countries so I ended taking small amounts in my containers when I when to Europe. Then on my way back I travel to Mexico so I took all the bottles because I was going to stay there 3 months. Then my set got finished there   I checked in the fine stores in Mexico but there were no Refills so I had to I'm wait till I return to USA to buy them. I'm strongly recommending the Lancôme Absolute products they all wonderful! Use them carefully and daily! * I love this product, and I've tried quite a few high end moisturizers. I'm 52 a post menopausal. I only gave it 4* because of the price, and the fragrance.  Most over the age of 50 will likely remember a bottle of White Shoulders sitting on their grandmother or mother's vanity, and that's what the smell of this cream reminds me of. Very floral and not just roses. I can live with the price, but I would definitely give it 5* if Lancôme would make a fragrance free version. The fragrance doesn't linger, but the smell reminds me of what old women smelled like when I was a child."

My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy! * I can't believe it took me so long to find this amazing product. I will have it a part of my skin routine forever now! Such a great lotion for my whole body. Highly recommend purchasing if you have dry and sensitive skin. Game changing product so excited I found it! * As someone with dry and flaky skin, I've tried countless lotions over the years, but none have worked as effectively as this one.

If Europe can ban Endocrine disruptors why cant we. 
This is like the only ""clean brand"" in the states. So dissapponting.. * I have combo acne prone skin for reference. 
This is like a light watery lotion but absorbs like a rich cream. It soaks right in and paces a velvety, supple feeling that I love. Sometimes my skin is drier so I could see me being able to use this during the day also without being too heavy. It does have a scent. It's like candy strawberry and flowers. It's light and goes away very shortly. You only need a little of this because it spreads so well. It can be easy to go overboard. I think this is definitely worth the money given the ingredients, packaging and how long this will last. Especially compared to other creams. I don't breakout but wake up with super soft, nourished skin. * I want to love this product so badly but the fragrance/essential oils in this caused my eczema to flare up. I'm so sad but I know it's on me for buying something with fragrance, natural or not. Otherwise I think it's a nice product it wasn't drying or anything and the texture is really nice just wish they had a fragrance free version. I will stick with the vegan ceremide cream"

Even the one my dermatologist prescribed! I went out on a limb to try this 2 in 1 sunscreen and it did not disappoint. Great mattifying and no white cast (I'm a brown skin gal) yet moisturizing. I took this on vacation and it withstood the very hot heat and sun. Two thumbs up for me. * My previous tube was great. Mattified the skin. Absorbed quickly. It did not make my skin oily. This newest tube is not good. While it still absorbs quickly it does not mattify my skin. I am very oily in a couple of hours if not before. I must note that i do shake the tube before use so i dont think im missing anything. * I used this as a cheaper alternative toy usual SPF  but it was greasy and broke me out. If i dont shake it i can see the oil. * I bought this sunscreen on accident because I thought it was a free gift and didn't check until I picked it up in store. However, I decided to use it because I needed a new sunscreen and surprisingly, this worked very well for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it sits on top of my other skin care products very well. This is also the first sunscreen that hasn't irritated my skin or burned my eyes which I truly appreciate because every sunscreen I've worn in the past had an extremely painful reaction on my eyes. I plan on repurchasing. * I use this product for daily use. It is lightweight and keeps your face clear and oil free. * i'm so glad i found this sunscreen! beginning with the biggest pros for me- i've seen no new breakouts, doesn't pill, and feels like nothing on my skin. i really hate when i can feel an spf on my face but with this product my skin feels light and clean. pilling and clinging to dry patches is very annoying and i've noticed ZERO pilling/exaggerating of dry patches. 

the few cons i have are very nitpicky- fairly strong smell and isn't mattifying. the smell is almost floral but mostly is just a normal sunscreen smell, which isnt a huge deal to me but might be too much for those sensitive to fragrance. i also wouldn't consider this a mattifying products which i actually prefer. theres little to no added shine but again, not very mattifying.

overall i'm so glad i finally found an spf that works on my skin! * Considering I have very oily skin, this didnt moisturize my skin at all. I had to use it as a straight up sunscreen over my regular moisturizer which defeated the purpose for me. It was defined mattifying to the point of drying."

Yes, the one product is smaller than they said in the details, but all of these still last a long time. The face wash has a really nice light citrus smell. I havent used the moisturizer yet because I couldnt read what it was exactly or when to use it (before looking it up) because the white writing on the transparent container was impossible to read on top of being partially rubbed off. So thats my only complaint. * Said the intense exfoliating treatment is a 1.7 Oz in description.  That is a lie.   It is only .05 Oz.   Not pleased. Want want I thought I ordered or a refund"

I have not been breaking out as much since using this, in fact this product helps to keep my skin at bay when it comes to breakouts and random pimples. Cannot recommend it enough! * Very light toner, makes my skin look and feel amazing, I definitely notice that my skin looks rougher when I run out and don't have a back up bottle. * This is the best toner you could buy. Love that they use clean ingredients. Its very gentle if u have sensitive skin but still removes dirt, excess oils, etc. its a must buy, along with the other skin care products they have < 3 * This product has immensely improved my skin clarity (tone, brightness, fading pigmentation) along with leaving the skin feeling extremely hydrated and smooth. * I've purchased this toner twice now and I absolutely love it. It's the only toner I use in the morning and it's perfect for makeup prep! Don't let the size fool you- my first bottle lasted me about 5 months! I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and my skin loopoves this stuff. I definitely recommend * I like the consistency and ingredients. It made my face break out so now I use it only on my neck and decolletage. * THIS PRODUCT!! WOW! That's really what I said after my first few uses.

That being said, my face was peeling because of the high strength of my lotion. At least it is now not peeling. * The moisturizer did help with my overall skin/was a decent moisturizer, but the pilling is/was so bad, almost constant, even hours after application. It also doesn't sit well under any make-up, even a just light skin tint. The smell is strong, but it honestly just smells like soap so that wasn't an issue for me and I kind of liked it. * This product is light and smells good.  I love that it has SPF. * I've used it for over 10 years. There's been changes with it over the years, but my skin soaks it up like a sponge and leaves me glowing. * Broke me out in hives! I have sensitive skin and for 3 days my skin was a flame. It finally erupted into hives on the 3rd day. Everything irritated my skin after using this. Do not try this product if you have sensitive skin. Opt for Dermalogica. * New formulation is terrible. 
I've been using this moisturizer for years! I always get compliments on my skin, it's been my go to forever. I even mix a little of it into my foundation the past few years when i want a more sheer coverage. 

They changed the formula and this one is not a winner. It instantly pills. Doesn't absorb. Right after putting it on, my face feels dry. I am so so disappointed and on the hunt for a new moisturizer. * I love this whole positively radiant line from the cleanser to the gel moisturizer it's all very good and didn't irritate my very sensitive skin which the oat line meant for sensitive skin, did. this is my favorite stuff."

It cools the face and gives it a nice glow * I'm in my mid 40s, with sensitive combination skin, and this gel cream has been absolutely fantastic!  My previous moisturizer was a bit too heavy, and this one is just right for day and night use!!! * This product is going back! It was recommended to me because they were out of stock of my go-to product (a different brand). Upon applying a thin layer of Tula 24-7 Weightless Moisture Day & Night Gel Cream to my face and neck, something instantly felt off. The texture was fine so I couldn't place what it was. A minute or so later it started - the slight face burning. Minutes passed and it got to the point I couldn't ignore it and had to wash my face yet again just to get it off! * I received this as a free sample and now I'm hooked. It works so great for my skin. It leaves it refreshed without being heavy. Other moisturizers can be too thick but this is thin and blends perfectly. Worth the purchase! * I started using this moisturizer about one month ago because Tula discontinued my favorite, Super Soothe. I call this a very happy accident, because now my skin is better than ever. Very soft, smooth and moisturized. I'm 64 years old with very sensitive skin - most everything breaks me out. But my skin just drinks this in. It's not sticky, and I don't think my skin has ever been so soft - with zero breakouts. I do always use the Clear It Up toner before I moisturize - I'm sure that helps. * My skin is oily but I still want a plumping hydrating effect as I'm in my late 30s. Most gel moisturizers are too lightweight for me, this one is neither too light or too heavy.  The lactic acid gives a gentle exfoliation so my skin looks more even. * I love the original 24/7 moisturizer but i wanted to try something lighter for under sunscreen in the summer. I felt that this would be the perfect solution. It is light weight, but it doesnt feel like it dries down on my skin and left me feeling very sticky all day. I have combination skin with some dry spots. This felt hydrating enough but I just cant get past how sticky it is, and the smell is a tad unpleasant. I will be sticking with the classic 24/7 moisturizer in the future."

I really liked it.  Easy to use, it didn't leave a white cast, I like everything about it.  I have to buy my own now.  My sister won't let me have hers! * I have been on the hunt for months for a moisturizer with SPF that isnt overly dewy in order to skip a step in my routine and thought this might be the answer based on the reviews I read. This might work great if you wear foundation daily or are under 30 with no texture, and yes this doesnt feel greasy or oily BUT it makes me look greasy and oily. I only spot conceal on most days and when I use this I have to put powder on my face because it makes me look so shiny, and the powder doesnt really stick in areas i dont have makeup on. For the price I really dont think i will keep it. * The cap bottom is concave so it doesn't want to sit upright on a flat surface in my bathroom. 
Please leave well enough alone. 
Stuff like this makes me want to abandon all your products if you are this careless with a little cap. * This moisturizer melts into the skin, do not sting the eyes and does not leave a white residual on the skin. This feels awesome on the face and neck. * I've gone through at least 4 bottles of this stuff this year and will continue to purchase it over and over again. 

It does not pill on me and i have never had an issue with the pump (I always get the larger size). Occasionally it will sting my eyes if I'm outside a lot in the summer, but i find that to be the case with most SPF."

I think i will ne switching bavk to the  Dermalogica skin smooyhing moisturizer afyer im done with this bottle. * this keeps my skin hydrated. its great for the oily places on my face. * Great for oily, acne prone skin. It's very lightweight + smells good (even though it's not a scented product). The packaging isn't the most aesthetic but that doesn't stop it from being an amazing product! You can also get this product in their acne clearing kit, along with a foaming face wash and spot treatment. Love it! * Got this moisturizer as a wake me up for the cooling effect, but the amount of product doesnt even cross the verticle E in ""clear"" written on the front of the bottle. Highly disappointed because had i noticed before using it, I would have returned it. * As someone that's been struggling with finding a good moisturizer for my oily skin I am very impressed I struggle with oily skin so bad and it his moisturizer doesn't leave a shine and controls the oil :) * The only thing I really dislike is the scent I cannot figure out what it smells like (I've read the ingredients it's a lot of flowers) but I hate it. Other than the scent it's really helped my skin, I have oily/combo, it absorbs really fast, a tiny amount goes a long ways! * I just want to start by saying, I've never had a moisturizer that has ""wowed"" me before. This still isn't that, but it's the closet I've got. My initial response was, ""this is really silky!""—and it is! It is a bit tacky while drying, but nothing horrible. Now the scent is a bit on the strong side. I normally am okay with floral scents, but this one is a little too much. Nothing that would make me wash it off, but I don't prefer it. The reason it's great for my very oily, acne-prone skin is that it doesn't leave me with that gross, greasy effect I get after using most cream moisturizers. However, if you have dry, acne-prone skin, I do not recommend this gel moisturizer. (Check out Tatcha's 'The Dewy Skin Cream' moisturizer—that one works great for my skin when it gets dry in the winter.) I am greatly appreciative for this moisturizer this summer, hopefully it continues pairing well with my CeraVe products, so I can continue using it!"

I would also add that it has a very oily finish, so if you have oily or combo skin, this likely isn't for you. * I've used this through a couple of bottles. My skin takes time to adjust to products (hence why the couple of bottles). 

I love that it is cruelty free and has vegan collagen. I love that it has SPF 30, a must for me, BUT it smells like sunscreen. It is definitely moisturizing, I don't have an issue with dry skin, BUT it's rather greasy. My daughter has even commented that my face is really greasy when I wear it (not really the vibe I'm going for). The chemicals burn my eyes as the day goes on. If I even wipe my eyes, it takes me minutes to wipe away whatever traces of this moisturizer is around my eyes. If I regularly wore makeup, this would be extra problematic. If you wear contacts, I do not recommend this. Imagine that burning getting caught up under your contacts.

I really, really wanted to love this because I didn't want to go through having my skin adjust to a new product, but I can't justify it based on it being a habit. * As mentioned by others, this would be more accurately described as ""SPF 30 sunscreen with collagen."" Smells exactly like a normal drugstore sunscreen. It's light and doesn't feel too greasy (but there is still a bit of that feeling). Overall it's ok * Just finished my bottle and ordered another one.  I have sensitive, adult cystic acne, 44 yr old skin that is in the normal to dry stage. This product:
1) has a sunscreen like feel to it when you first apply it, then it fades away
2) has a great glass bottle that you can get ALL of the product out of!
3) Spreads well- at little goes a long way- to much will make it sticky and it won't dry down fast
4) plays well with Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid serum and PUR love your selfie foundation. * I'm getting older, and my skin is changing, and I hate it. My old favorite daily moisturizer/SPF by No. 7 started making me breakout after years of no problems, so I had to search for something new. All the others I tried that claimed to not clog pores also happened to be too drying for my slightly oily but aging but still acne prone and also kinda dehydrated skin (ugh). But the moisture level of this Goldilocks cream is just right. If you have dry or slightly dry skin you will probably like it, if you are 40+ you will probably like it, if you're young and have oily skin you might NOT like it because it is not a light liquid, it's definitely a thick-ish cream. I can tell the fragrance they were trying for was *floral* but it leans more chemical, although it disappears in a minute or two. After application the skin feels moist, but not greasy. Makeup applies perfectly over it with no pilling at all. I somehow manage to not look shiny over the course of the day, which is practically miraculous. It doesn't seem to make me break out, as I've been using it for several weeks with no notable flares. I am relieved to have found my new favorite! * i like how this spf does not leave a white cast like other spfs. Plumped my skin right up and gave it a nice silky glow. * Love the fact its a moisturizer and has spf. Its easy to use and dont need as much since it spreads easily on your skin. I can feel it last for a good amount of time too"

It does nothing for my skin… super greasy, no firming, and makes my skin look worse. For the price I expected at least a decent product. In my opinion there are SO many great moisturizers out there that out perform this and are cheaper. * Bought this because I like the day cream version a lot.  This however was just not a great formulation for me.  It simply NEVER absorbs into my skin and then it just rubs off on my pillow case or hands eventually.   And I don't use an excessive amount because of the price tag.  I'm a big fan of using the minimal amount required.  It's too late to return it, so it's just going to move into my graveyard of products that I can't bare to throw away because, $$$, but just don't work on my skin.  Le sigh.  But, I still love the extra firming day cream and all my other Clarins products.  I would recommend trying a sample of this before buying if possible so you know if it's a good consistency for your skin. * Excellent result 👍 * Light weight, non greasy.  Plant enriched.  Vegan.

I love it so much, but like someone else said in the comments…I wish they made a bigger size because i go through this stuff so quick since i use it day & night. * I have extremely dry skin. It's very sensitve and reactive due to an autoimmune disease. I can use hardly anything on my face. I use and like the Kiehl's cica but thought this would be better with the colder temps now. It's not. Skin is dryer and I can tell my skin barrier is unhappy now. It reminds me of using body lotion on your face (which I've tried a few times) it leaves a chalky matte finish too. Not good for my middle aged skin. 
Their Cica cream is far superior and so is anything by Ursa Major for all you out there with unhappy dry skin. This doesnt cut it as a facial lotion. * This is vry healing on my dry skin. It gave me a couple of whiteheads on my face, but I noticed that it really calmed the redness. It's a trade-off. I would rather cover a pimple with a little makeup rather than cover up the redness all over my face. * It's fine. It didnt do much for my chronically dry skin. My face actually looked a little worse the next day. However, my neck and upper chest were improved after one use. It's now my neck/chest cream and i'll stick to an oil on my face."

My 33 year old skin looks phenomenal! It's so moisturizing and soft on my skin with a beautiful glow. * Easily the BEST anti-aging deeply hydrating moisturizer I've ever used!!!! I've not only purchased the entire live for myself but family members and it's worth every penny. A LITTLE goes a long way! * The best face cream I have ever used. * This face cream was so expensive and I felt it didn't work for me. It made my face very sensitive and my foundation didn't stay well on top it. I was disappointed but will try something new. * I am loving the results of these products. * I've tried MANY MANY moisturizers. this one is THE BEST hands down! Use it day 1 and your face feels like a babys butt the very next day. That's how fast and amazing this stuff works. Nothing will make your skins feel this soft and supple. And no breakouts! (a few moisturizers make me break out for some reason but not this) The only downside is the price; it's horrendously expensive so I hafta wait until my bday & xmas gift cards and rewards points to buy it so I only buy it about once a year. A little goes along way so I can make it last a few months. I'm 56 with normal to dry skin. * I have used it for a week now. Like the way my skin feels I use it at night. Packaging is a little over the top. Contents is a lot smaller than it appears from the outside.

I use Fenty Beauty's cleanser, toner and Moisturizer and after the fenty moisturizer soaks into my skin I then add this butter and its the missing piece the cherry on top! * My skin has been feeling dry for months this is the only thing that has helped make my skin feel close to normal again * Great moisturizer!  I love it * This stuff is gold! I have dehydrated reactive acne prone skin and this stuff does it all for me. Deeply moisturizes my skin without feeling greasy, absorbs quickly but lasts all day, doesn't disrupt my skin, AND is the best primer ever. My tinted serum lays flawlessly on my skin and doesnt get shiny throughout the day. Never going back to any other moisturizer. * Its not greasy, its a moisturizer. A little goes a long way. It does not clog my pores. I cleanse, tone, serum and then use this product to moisturize. It even recommends to use after using vitamin C and I hope you follow up with sunscreen. Smells like shea butter."

It made my skin break out in these weird tiny bumps and caused an acne flare up. I would not recommend this product. * this is a very nice moisturizer BUT it pills horribly. it messes up the makeup i put on top of it everytime. no matter how much i rubbed it in. will be returned. * Melts onto my skin.

There's a slight smell to it nothing overpowering. I didn't get a tingly feelings. The product is very light weight. Only needed a small dab to cover my whole face. It does fell kind of like the elf tone adjusting primer just not as greasy. My foudnation glided on real easily. I do think my skin does look good so far :) Very mich recommened for those with dry skin * Was just in Ulta looking around and saw this new item from NYX. Decided to try it and I am so happy I did. This primer is so good and is gripping like Milk. This product is long lasting and keeps the shine away. It has a tingling sensation when applying and I Love that ! NYX is really upping their game and I believe, they are doing a great job. Thanks for a good product for less cost. * this product sucks oily rat in sewer * Finally a primer that does not make my face breakout!!! 
Love! Love! Love!! * Did not like * I do not have sensitive skin but when i applied on my face it feel more like a burning sensation than a cooling effect . I really wanted to love this product but after a couple of times of using this it made me breakout bad . My skin is usually clear but it broke me out on the spots I applied. If you apply to much it can also cause flaking and ruin your makeup . * Sorry but 5 STARS is not enough, I am giving 5 MILLION STARS for my rating on this. WOW ,I CAN'T live without this either,  and do like they say, put it on the REFRIGERATOR  especially if you are like me with these crazy HOT FLASHES AND NIGHT SWEATS , this will save your life !!!!!"

It really does give me a glow.  I cant wait to try the rest of the Juice beaty line! Thanks for keeping it organic. * I really like this combo moisturizer by Juice Beauty. I've been trying to 'multitask' my products to minimize the layers I put on my face everyday. This moisturizer dries to a sheer glow and doesn't remain too tacky. It doesn't pile under makeup and the fragrance is super light. Will buy again! * I love how it doesn't leave that white look on my face since it contains SPF.

A little goes a long way. * Ive been using this product for about a year now (i think) maybe a few months less than that.. I do like it, I can feel how it seems to be tightening my skin.. But, i havent noticed any difference. I have noticed at the very top where my hair line is, it gets super dry. I am not sure if it is the moisturizer or what but i have tried several different shampoos and conditioners and still have the problem. But i havent tried a different moisturizer yet. The smell does not bother me, it does smell good. I do feel like it isn't as moisturizing as it should be though… I really wish I could find the old Chanel Hydra Micro Creme! 

Honestly, I believe this moisturizer just depends on your skin type. I use it with my Chanel foundation.. I am still iffy about it because I feel like it also shows my ""fine lines"" more but I am not very good with all of this anyway. Lol * I unfortunately have sensitive skin, I find the fragrance to be irritating on me. Plus I have a bit of a break out coming in from hormones. I've been trying it for a while, I really wanted to love it. * Best product ever. * The No 1 Chanel line is phenomenal. I have 3 products now and will continue to add more. This is just what my ""mature"" skin needed. 
Thank you Katarina…Chanel and Ulta are lucky to have such a professional, knowledgeable and kind associate! * I got this as a sample and I immediately bought it once it ran out. I live in the desert so my skin gets really dry with the weather here, this moisturizer has been the only thing that's been able to hydrate my skin without leaving it greasy and my pores look like they're getting smaller. I'm pretty selective when it comes to spending money but this was well worth it. * I tried this in the store on the back of my hand and could instantly visibly see a difference in my skin texture. I am NOT a $115.00 facial cream buying type of woman but the next month I just had to have it and never felt a bit of guilt on this splurge."

So, I did some research and started to use ELEMIS. I guess it's ok except for the bottle it comes in, terrible. Very hard to come out, I ended up cutting it open and put the contents in a jar. Advice, change the container * I got a sample from ipsy— ordinarily I would not go for shimmery products but this gives such a healthy, natural glow on mornings that i dont have time to slap on layers of serum. It rules! * This product gives your skin a natural looking glow without looking fake. * i personally don't use it as a standalone moisturizer. i mix half with my lotion and it still provides a good glow that is almost overwhelming,but not. i love it and will always keep 
it on the counter * I had received a sample of this. It sat with my other samples for awhile, and one day I tried it. From that day on I was hooked! Put on after cleansing, serum, moisturizing, and spf. It makes a great primer before makeup, or you can use it for no makeup days as a beautiful finish that leaves bare skin glowing. I bought the full size after I ran out. Definitely worth the cost!! Love this! * I got a sample from a advant calendar around Christmas and became obessed. I love this. It looks so good alone.

It smells good when you're putting it on, but then it makes your pillow smell like wet dog. This dried out my face horribly and created big dry patches under my eyes and above my eyelids. I have to return it. * My skin is extremely sensitive to new products, especially retinols. This took a few weeks to get used to, but I'm now using it almost every night. My skin has SO much more life to it! * I recently switched my skincare line from Lancôme to Kate Somerville and let me just say that my face hasn't looked or felt this good in years. I have seen more results in only a few short weeks than I ever did with Lancôme. AND this line is less expensive. It's a win win! * For the first two weeks, everything was fine. Last night, I put it on and it literally burnt the skin off around my eyes. I love the smell and feel of it, but I please be careful if you aren't used to using retinol. Avoid adding near your eyes or mouth * Texture-creamy yet light weight 
Smell- think of a orange creamsicle 
Skin type: dry and sensitive 
Provides a nice glow with the perfect amount of moisture. I apply this cream 2-3 times a night other nights I apply the ordinary rose hip oil * First, AMAZING smell! Like waffles & orange juice! 😁 I am 45 with normal to dry skin. I have not noticed any sensitivity after using. As soon as I put it on I can tell it's doing something. Feels like drinking a cold glass of water on a hot day. My skin drinks it up. After several weeks of using, my face is smoother, more evenly toned, and brighter. I REALLY like this product!"

It's a good product to have and I'm glad I was gifted by dermalogica. * Gifted by Estée Lauder , Loved the product, it was lightweight and perfect for my night time routine. It worked perfect on my sensitive skin, I will continue to incorporate it into my everyday routine. It was not overly fragranced and blended nicely. * I try to find products that already have SPF included so having this available in travel size is not just convenient, but also a great product. It's moisturizing without being heavy so it's great for daytime wear. Its great as a base before applying foundation.  Gifted by dermoligica. * Dermalogica's Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF 50 has become my go-to daily moisturizer. From the first application, I loved how it felt on my skin—lightweight yet deeply hydrating. It blends seamlessly and leaves my skin feeling firm and smooth, making it a perfect base for makeup. I've also noticed a brighter complexion and improved elasticity over time. Plus, the broad-spectrum SPF 50 gives me peace of mind knowing my skin is well-protected. * This moisturizer is very hydrating and perfect for someone like me who often forgets to apply sunscreen 
before leaving home. Its milky, lightweight texture absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't leave any white cast. It's perfect for layering under makeup without feeling greasy or heavy. The dual-action formula hydrates the skin while providing sun protection from uv rays. Gifted by Dermalogica! * Very hydrating with not a strong scent. The travel size is perfect for tossing in a daily bag, and reapplying when the spf has worn off or washed off. My skin didn't get burned in the sun, so the spf50 seems to work well! Something I will definitely repurchase. Gifted by detmalogica * I think this has become my new favorite moisturizer. I always like to have spf in a moisturizer and I love that this one is 50 spf.

Highly recommend. * After using this product once I woke up the next morning with severe redness and achne-like bumps over my entire face!! I wanted to itch my face off it was so bad. Once I removed the product my face started to calm down. My skin is never sensitive like this, but it did NOT like this product what-so-ever!! * I wouldn't say that I am a fan of any skincare product, I hope they just do their job.

This lotion promises a lot—gentle exfoliation, brightening effects, and hydration—all while being safe for sensitive and acne-prone skin. 

By the end of the week, my skin looked more even-toned, and some of my dark spots had started to fade. The gentle exfoliation from the lactic acid helped in renewing my skin without causing any irritation or redness—a common issue I face with more aggressive exfoliants. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid exceeded my expectations! This dynamic blend of lactic acid and vitamin C not only brightens my complexion but also gently exfoliates. My skin feels smoother and looks more radiant. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula makes it ideal for use under makeup. This lotion has swiftly become one of my top choices for achieving a glowing, healthy appearance. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C is perfect for my normal to dry skin. It also brightens and evens out my skin. I love to apply it when my legs are out for a natural glow! * Looking for bright and radiant skin? Look no further! The lightweight moisturizing lotion contains 7% lactic acid for gentle exfoliation and Vitamin C for skin that will look glowy and fresh! My skin looks smoother and softer after just a few days! * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid is a staple especially for the Summer. I'm always on the hunt for some sort of vitamin c lotion. Since we have hard water that can be so tedious. Not only does it help repair my skin but I also get to brighten my skin at the same time. * I'm a big fan of the AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid AHA! This product truly brings out the radiance in my skin with its brightening formula that gives me a nice glow. I already own a few AmLactin products, but this one stands out to me because of its amazing scent – a lovely hint of cocoa that I adore. I believe this ingredient plays a part in maintaining the health and glow of my skin. I've noticed that the Vitamin C in this lotion is really working on evening out my skin tone and keeping it super smooth! * This product has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine, especially because my skin needs extra moisture when I'm constantly in the sun in the summer. I love that this product absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue! Highly recommend"

I had to wash it off. Returned it to the store. This one is not for me but Olay doesn't make it easy to know which one of their products to use. * I purchased this moisturizer from Ulta and it arrived within a few days. I use the product both morning and evening even if I am supposed to only use it once a day. My skin appears brighter and it is definitely smoother. I even use it on my neck but so far I haven't noticed a difference there. * This smooths my face and doesn't cause breakouts which so many moisturizers do. I haven't found a moisturizer yet that doesn't break me out. It lasts all day and works well underneath your makeup or by itself. I definitely plan on continuing to use this. * A couple months back I went on vacation to the Bahamas where my skin ended up breaking out very badly.  I brought this moisturizer with. It felt like my face was burning off and every time I took a shower more skin peeled off my face. It was the most miserable time ever. I assumed it had something to do with the trip. A couple days ago I tried this product again, the next morning the same thing happened, immediately this time. My face is burning, feels hot to the touch, bright red and is breaking out with little bumps all over and starting to do that gross oozy thing again. Now I realize it's this moisturizer. It might be awesome on some, just not me. I really wanted to like this product but I wouldn't wish this horrible reaction on anybody. So I guess just be cautious and if you notice something doesn't feel right, stop using it immediately. * This stuff isnt just great for your face, but can work on other sensitive areas too. I had dark marks/hyperpigmentation left behind from a medical adhesive left on my thigh too long, and this genuinely helped to fade those lines to a point where they are less noticeable * I love the way this smells. I use it in the mornings, a little hint of citrus smell is nice to give you a little wake up. Goes on a little sticky, but drys smooth and soft. Definitely recommend. * I've been a licensed esthetician for over 5 years and also an Ulta employee. I got this as a gift for the holidays and had no interest in trying it. I'm such a skincare snob. Well, I tried it. I absolutely love this moisturizer. I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear it because I'm glowing."

Light scent. Does not irritate my sensitive skin. Calming. Definitely a favorite face cream. * I bought this and absolutely love it!! I will definitely buy it again!! * I have acne rosacea along with endometriosis, so my skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and breakouts so easily. I have tried every moisturizer from the drugstore to my dermatologist prescriptions, and nothing, I mean nothing has compared to this. this has not made my face itch, burn, or breakout. it actually took away about 90% of my redness in the first 24 hours i used it. i never thought Chanel would be my life line, but its now my holy grail. if you are truly sensitive, and not just ""sensitive"" like the majority of women say and they use like Cerave on their skin, but seriously have sensitive skin, try this out. you wont be disappointed. id rather pay more for quality ingredients than anything from a drugstore. * I have been a hardcore Charlotte Tillbury Magic Cream fan. I started using tretonin so it was suggested I use this moisturizer before and after applying the tretonin. I absolutely love it. It's extremely moisturizing and smells amazing. My face is very dry but after using this it feel so soft and smooth. It's kind of small for the price but I love it so much I will suck it up. * I wanted to love this item but I used it once and the second day, the pump stopped working.   I tried to pump many times but no product was coming out.   It was definitely a splurge but for the price it's not worth it.   Maybe change the packaging??? * I love the results of this product but I'm allergic to the fragrance. I was sneezing, runny nose, etc. Why does everyone who make such lovely lotions have to ruin it with fragrances? * My skin looks so healthy radiant and feels soft to the touch!"

It looks great under makeup, you wake up as if you had just washed your face, I love it! Super moisturizing. * I am of the darker persuasion in her late 30s and it is hard to find a moisturizer that does not over power you with the smell. But this, this one is lovely. It goes on like butter ladies. Trust me it blends well with other products too. * This cream smells like the airplane cabin bathroom pink hand soap, which is slightly offputting. It also feels thick and heavy without seeming to sufficiently moisturize my face, so I think this formula just isn't for me."

It leaves a beautiful glow and deeply hydrates but again, not for oily skin or if you leave in hot weather.Too heavy for a day cream * I got this product with high hopes. It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy. I don't like the packaging, but i've noticed a lot of brands going this route so its whatever. I would recommend it though."

I have noticed really nice improvements in my skin's texture and appearance.  Really happy I gave this brand a try. * I've tried several different moisturizers, and the glass skin water-gel is absolutely amazing. 
The product makes my face feeling refreshed and so soft.

One of the things I've learned is if your skin barrier is shot - you're not going to heal your acne. This product has significantly improved my skin for the better. It truly does what it says: improves skin barrier. It also will help heal a breakout literally overnight which is amazing! * Been using it at night after my HA application and waking up with silky soft skin with faded blemish appearance. Will buy again. * Because of my new facial eczema, my skin barrier was in need of help. I tried multiple products that left my skin feel and greasy and heavy, But this product was a lifesaver.  It's lightweight but very hydrating.  I can't wait to try the daytime, cream and face wash * I've used this product for 2 months now and haven't noticed ant differences in my skin. I was looking forward to the green tea and ceramides ingredients in it. The texture of the moisturizer is fine. Not super thick and not too thin. I have oily skin and it doesn't make me breakout or anything. Just not seeing the results I anticipated. I'd rather use the Olay's regenerist lines or Peach & Lily's matcha pudding over this where I can really see a daily difference * Usually healing my skin barrier means putting up with a week+ of slathering my face with a thick moisturizer or balm. As someone with sensory processing issues, I hateee feeling residue from those products on my skin, especially when going to sleep (iykyk)

But OMG this product is a PERFECT balance of hydrating and lightweight. It feels like my skin drinks it in and by the time I'm ready for bed there is hardly any residue! At first I worried maybe this meant it was too lightweight to a truly heal my barrier, but after a few weeks I can attest that it really does work.
The only downside is the packaging (they don't stand up) but tbh the formulation is so good, i'm still giving 5 stars. I also recommend the AM moisturizer, but idk how effective it is as SPF. Def get the night time though! * I purchased this because of the ingredients and the reviews. The product is titled ""Barrier Renew."" One of the active ingredients is oleic acid: ""Free fatty acids (FFAs), specifically monounsaturated FFAs such as oleic acid, may disrupt skin barrier and act as permeability enhancers for other compounds present in plant oils"" [36].Dec 27, 2017. That is what I found about oleic acid. I look like I sat on the sun without protection.  Disappointed and will be returning. * my skin feels absolutely amazing since using this at night. within minutes your skin feels soft, calm, supple. and the next morning I have a beautiful glow. I'm obsessed!"

I like how it works and how it makes my skin feel. * found this product on sale and thought I would give it a try, and so far, I really like it - feels nice and haven't had any bad reactions, nice find * Wow! I was blown away by how effective this max hydration cream by ROC is! When you first apply this you can feel it deeply hydrating your skin. It's fast absorbing and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. After about a week of use i started to notice a slight reduction of my visible fine lines and wrinkles. After about 3 weeks to a month of use I have much firmer skin. This cream is amazing! 
Contains Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol for maximum results. Dermatologist tested. Paraben free. Non comedogenic. Non irritating and fragrance free. 
I received this product free from Roc & PinchMe. * So gar I'm enjoying the  line smoothing max hydration cream. It's a bit thicker than I anticipated but it's creamy enough the it goes on smooth. After just a few days I noticed how hydrated my skin feels. I can't wait to see what the future holds in continuing this product.  Because I sure need it. Retinol these lines honey.. retinol these lines lol. Thanks ulta * ١like the effectiveness, moisturizing, and skin softness of the product. They mention it works well, leaves their faces feeling hydrated, and is the absolute best moisturizer they have ever tried. Some appreciate wrinkle reduction and the skin look. However,I have reported that the product can irritate sensitive skin and burn their eyes. Opinions are mixed on the scent and value for money. * Love the feel of my skin after putting this on. It's feel so soft. * I have not used this cream for very long, but so far I like it. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I have just started using the RoC products. So far I have been very pleased. My skin is already looking better. I'm hoping that in time I will see a significant improvement in my skin."

So this will now be two of their skincare products I really like and does the job. And again, affordable! I use it in my morning routine and feels great! Goes on smooth and light weight. I would recommend! * I just bought this came home put it on and instantly got a headache from the strong perfume smell. It's like they dumped a whole bottle of floral old lady perfume in this moisturizer. I looked at the ingredients and it actually says perfume and that shouldn't be in a face moisturizer. Returning this immediately * I used it for the first time a month ago … my skin is glowing    It looks firmer and I definitely will buy again * I dont know what it is about this product but even if it is the onky thing I wear that day it atill peels and clumps on my skin after it dries. Nit a fan. * The moisturizer itself works well. I like the feel of my skin while wearing it. I gave it a week but I can't wear it any more. The scent is so strong and just to much for a facial moisturizer. It smells like the sunflower perfume my Mom wore in the 90's. So to me, it just smells very dated and old. haha I gave it away. * I love this day cream!!  My face is prone to hormonal breakouts, and since using this product my skin has definitely calmed down.  I don't even wear foundation anymore (unless its an event or something), I just put this on, then put on some concealer and bronzer and I'm good to go for the day!

Great for milia!! Mine is starting to go away. * I sampled this in the store and it smelled wonderful and moisturized with being too heavy so it was perfect for my oily skin.

Do not use for outdoor activities. It will burn your eyes SO badly. I don't have sensitive eyes or skin but I was practically blind on a summer hike. Horrible! I expect more from a brand like this. * I do have to say I only just tried this product so I'm unsure if it will break me out in the future. However it feels lovely on my skin. Before I applied this product I had some slight dry patches on my skin and it noticeably reduced the dryness. It didn't leave any white cast on my skin (I do have very fair skin though) and it made my skin looks very dewy and glowing! I would definitely recommend this product :) * I really do not understand the bad reviews. This is a great moisturizer with SPF in it. I personally like an all in one product and with 4.2 ounces you get a good value for your money. Not only does this have great ingredients, it is hydrating, sinks into your skin very easily, doesn't leave a white cast, and does not make your eyes burn. My skin glows after applying and it also wears SO well under makeup!! I do not find this sunscreen to be greasy at all. It actually makes me less oily throughout the day compared to the other SPF moisturizer I was using previously. I was using the Cerave AM lotion but wasn't in love with it as it took a lot of TLC to blend in and made my makeup pill. I was recommended this product by a friend and I am so glad I bought this. For those concerned about fragrance I notice a very very slight sunscreen smell but it doesn't bother me and I am someone who is sensitive to scents. This is a chemical sunscreen so some people may be sensitive to that. I am someone who isn't. I prefer chemical sunscreens anyway because they usually do not leave a white cast and are more hydrating. Mineral sunscreens are always too drying for my skin and leave too much of a whitecast. * I love this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I just love how it applies and how moisturized my skin feels afterwards. * It's ok. Def more of a sunscreen feel. Doesn't leave a white cast but takes a while to soak in. I have to wait quite awhile before I can begin applying my makeup. Like a lot of Kiehl's products but won't buy this one again. * I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now and I swear by it. I put it on in the morning before applying my makeup and it works perfectly. I've found that some moisturizers make my foundation look kinda wonky, but my makeup goes on top of this one nicely. Also, I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this product. I'm never going back!"

I passed over this product for years because the package does not include the seal. I was absolutely missing out. This jar cream is the best body moisturizer I have ever used on my eczema, dermatographia, contact dermatitis, and other skin disorders. It has absolutely helped my skin heal from flare ups as well as help prevent new ones. I do not use this on my face so I cannot speak to its effect on acne. It's comforting and relieving to know I have finally found something to mitigate the suffering. No more intense burning pain just from water or scratching until the skin is raw. This is not a beauty product to me, it's a medical necessity helping my quality of life. Be patient and give this a try, your skin will get better. * Im currently using this moisturizer along with a 10% Benzoyl peroxide cleanser and its the best. My skin type is dry but acne prone fyi. This moisturizer can be used for the face and body and my skin does not feel dry or tight, Simply moisturized. * I use to moisturize my face in the morning and night. I definitely recommend! * So im new to skincare. I was having a bad breakout. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin. Ever ""sensitive skin moisturizer"" straight up burns my face. This moisturizer has never hurt my face. I use this as my night time moisturizer. In only a week i have seen great changes to my face. It feels super smooth. And dont quote me on this, but i BELIEVE this product has niacinamide in it. The niacinamide cleared my redness. I highly reccomend if you are stumped on a moisturizer for sensitive skin. * My skin is dry and that makes it quite sensitive.

I'll use a coupon and some rewards points and purchase more soon. It's great! It has a lemony scent and goes on very smoothly. A little goes a long way. It absorbs quickly and evens out my complexion. It's not greasy, leaves a nice vibrancy and I'm already seeing a difference after a week! Impressive! * I like this brand and decided to try this one with the sale. it's so light and makes my skin glow. No breakouts or bad reactions. Such a pleasant scent, like a lemony dessert. * I LOVE this moisturizer!! I have super sensitive skin and this didn't flare me up at all. A little goes a long way! * The smell is very strong, like a lemon meringue pie (I docked off one star). But the smell, from natural herbal ingredients, disappears after a few minutes. Dimethicone (silicone) makes this cream feel luxurious, soft, and smooth. * Got this on sale half off, figured id try it out since ive heard great things about this brand.  Im glad i did.  
It does have a fragrance but the fragrance reminds me of refreshing lemon very slightly.  Absorbs pretty well, and leaves me glowing.  I have sensitive skin thats normal-oily, acne prone, and alot of redness.  This did not bother my skin at all.  I love it. * I have eczema flare ups here and there & also have combo (mostly oily skin). The smell isnt too over bearing which I love. It has not broken me out. I love the moisture bomb and have recently bought a separate vitamin C (not belif)… but ngl i forget to use it here and there… this makes me 100x more accountable on getting that vitamin c in my routine! Overall love it! Belif products never miss for me * I really love this product! Ive been using the aqua bomb for so long at night, its nice to have the vitamin c in the morning!

It's almost like the product went off or dried in the tube and the dried out parts mixed back in. You can visibly see the particles in there * I have oily skin. I JUST bought this today and it has a thick consistency, and it smells like nothing. Maybe a little tiny bit like chemicals. But it also has a white cast, so if youre a person of color i wouldn't recommend this. * this product sucks. I've tried it a number of times and every time it pills up. it flakes off my face and makes it impossible to do makeup on top because it flakes off so much. do not buy! * Although it does provide oil control and has little to no white cast, it's very thick and isn't ""lightweight "". Very thick and makes it hard to distrubuted across the face without roughly dragging it on your face. * Its not light weight and it feels like a sunscreen and not a moisturizer. Its really heavy and leaves a cast. IMO its not melanin friendly i had to wash it off in order to not walk around looking like a ghost. * Not a ""lightweight daily moisturizer"" at all. More like a thick sunscreen. Didnt have any bad reactions with it but it was difficult to rub in consistently and dried really quick. Does help with oil control though. Probably wont repurchase. * I love it. I use as primer and spf. the less product under my makeup the better. set with powder."
