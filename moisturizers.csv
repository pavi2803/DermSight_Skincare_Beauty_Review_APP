The moisture surge is perfect for aging skin, especially if you live in a desert like I do. * I veen used this cream since a long time because the product it's excelent..
Soft for my skin and no too heavy fir my skin.
Also the price for the product. * I have an oily face and I have been using this cream for years because it helps me keep my face balanced. 10/10 cream * I've only been using this product for almost 3 weeks but I don't know where it's been all my life! My skin is looking the best it has in YEARS! It's so gentle and feels amazing on the skin! I'll definitely continue to purchase! * I can not believe how soft this moisturizer makes my face feel.  I have  gone a second day without reapplying it and my face still feels soft and not dry one bit.  I am very happy with this product and don't see myself changing. * I used to use a diff moisturizer and they changed the formula and i just can't like the new one. I got this as a christmas gift and i was unsure at first since it is more of a gel. I absolutely love it. It is so hydrating and leaves my skin looking dewy and refreshed. I have sensitive dry skin and i tried it without any other products and it worked wonders. I will continue to use this once the jar i received runs out. * I wanted to try the Clinique moisturizing mini before I buy a larger size. So far I  like how it hydrates my skin and doesn't feel heavy or greasy."

Almost as if it clogged my pores. I used it for 8 weeks and as soon as I stopped, the bumps went away * it broke out my skibiti skin… rawr * this pruduct made my skin so soft and hydrated I love this and can't recommend it enough! * I love this sleep mask! My only con is it doesnt smell great, but at least it works great. Perfect for my dry skin * Returned, I don't have tolerance for any moisturizers that you can feel after application. This dried down some and I could feel some tightness on my face. Going back to drugstore cerave night * I would definitely recommend. This sleep mask worked miracles on my dry and oily skin. I love this and I will always use it. Totally recommend! * I have been looking for a product to help hydrate my very dry and sensitive skin. I have rosacea and the middle of my cheeks are very sensitive to new products. After I started using this at night it help tremendously. Buy this ASAP!"

Anytime I try something new, I regret it and come back to this! * Love this product. Feels great on my face. * I continue to use this product over and over as it keeps my skin healthy and glowing. It feels good as well as looks good. It is such a great product. * I loved the non-spf Hope in a jar.  The store was out of that and only had this spf-30 so I bought this.  I returned it.  It doesn't feel the same.  It's greasy and pasty.  After applying makeup, my skin was shiny and oily!
  It doesn't sink into my skin like silk as the other smooth-glow moisturizer does. 
  If you're hoping this version feels like the original, you'll be disappointed. * I got this as a trial size and have been hooked ever since.  It feels so nice after I wash my face.  It's not greasy or oily.  My skin really has looked nice and have gotten compliments.  Don't get the SPF30 with it though.  That was oily and pasty.  I didn't like that version.  I use another Philosophy brand with SPF for daytime use. * I feel like I walkes out of a spa with this stuff on. Smells wonderful- refreshed ans ready! 

Doesnt feel too thick on face which I love. * I've been using Hope in a Jar for many years. I love the way it feels on my skin and my skin never feel dry."

It is break out only the purple one is good all of the color it's bad don't get it. It's so expensive just get bubble. It's cheaper and you can get the watermelon smell so good. * I have used expensive products for the last 6 years. Even spending over $300 for a moisturizer. I went to the dermatologist and they told me to stop using fragrances and dyes on my skin, I dreaded thinking that Cerave was my only option. After researching I came across Drunk Elphant and decided to so the 30 day kit to reset my skin, I figured it was worth a try. After my first week I noticed how clear and smooth my skin looked. Im over 40 and I didn't believe my skin could get better. Not only does this brand have clean ingredients, its been, in my 20 years of being a product junkie, one of the most effective brands I've tried. My skin is a living testament!!!! This moisturizer is life changing. I would try to start of doing the 30 day reset, if you are using other brands with ingredients like alcohol or silicone, I don't know that you will have the same experience. I hope this helps someone looking for clean ingredients and great skin!!! * It broke me out BADLY, and my skin was absolutely burning! I do NOT recommend what so ever, especially if you have sensitive skin. * Its a great moisturizer but it feels like my vanicream moisturizer cream * This product is pretty hydrating and is a good moisturizer, but for the price it really isnt worth it. Especially for kids who dont need the peptide supplement. I like using it as a moisturizer, but other than that its full potential cant be used by those who dont need peptides. * This broke my face out and caused chemicle burns. I tried it multiple times and it always caused these side affects. * I tend to see 4+ stars reviews on products but tend not research further. I narrowed it down to solely using this product in my face and nir adding others. I broke out in multiple areas on my face. Worst part was upon receiving the product, the pump did not work. I had to twist off the top portion each use. 
Definitely should not continue to use a product that breaks you out."

I thought this would be a nice simple, fragrance-free moisturizer for my acne prone combination skin. after 2 weeks of use I experienced whiteheads, oiliness, dryness/itchiness/irritation, texture EVERYWHERE and deep, cystic pimples that hurt to the touch. it hasn't been as bad since, but it took me 6 months and lots of adapelene to clear the acne and scars. I looked it up & my suspicions were confirmed- this ranks highly for comedogenic ingredients!! be careful and pls spare yourself if you have acne prone skin. im sure its a great moisturizer for other skin types. * I picked this as my birthday gift and was glad I did. * I have been having problems with dry skin and this makes my skin so moisturized and glowy i highly recommend this product * This moisturizer broke my face out after 2 uses and took over 1 week to fully resolve. It basically caused tiny skin colored bumps all over my face. If you have senstive skin I wouldnt recommened! * Very light weight and feels so good on my skin. I have extremely dry skin and psoriasis and it has helped tremendously with my dry patches. * I hope this is never changed or discontinued. I've been struggling with skin issues that came out of nowhere. Acne, dryness, irritation, texture. I read online a lot of people with redness and rosacea said this worked for them, so I tried it, not with high hopes. I've tried nearly EVERYTHING. I can't even list all the moisturizers I've tried. They all irritate my skin and make me breakout or turn red or burn and sting. This stuff doesn't at all! Not only that, it's THE MOST MOISTURIZING PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED, hands down! On top of that, after a couple weeks, it's completely changed my skin. My skin looks literally like glass! It's SO SMOOTH, the texture is GONE, my pores are small and smooth, I have a glow that I've never had in my life and I'm 35! my skin is SO SOFT and supple. I will NEVER LET THIS STUFF GO. If they see this, please DONT CHANGE IT! I've tried them all from every brand and this is MILES BEYOND the rest. If you're considering trying it, try it! They do offer a small trial size (at least as of now). Not everything works for everyone, but try it! * It is really good, i got pne for my ulta b-day present and i do not regret picking it at all and i have nevere used something better that this. I will definitely be buying this next time!"

I felt that this would be the perfect solution. It is light weight, but it doesnt feel like it dries down on my skin and left me feeling very sticky all day. I have combination skin with some dry spots. This felt hydrating enough but I just cant get past how sticky it is, and the smell is a tad unpleasant. I will be sticking with the classic 24/7 moisturizer in the future. * Light, perfect moisturizer for morning & night with all the goodies. No need for extra facial oils. Plus, there are no harsh chemicals."

I do not like the new formula.
1. Smell, okay but old was amazing. 
2. Sticky feeling.
3. My skin doesn't feel hydrated after applying.
Just a bummed!
Thought I found my forever but I'm searching for better moisturizer. Ugh * Gave to an actress on a film set who needed some under eye hydration. 
Had her apply before bed…next morning one of her cheeks were red like a sunburn. * I am 46 years, I bought the first formula and used to let my face so plump... 
Because of the price I stoped buying it. But I decided to get it again and is good, but they changed the formula and I am lost. Doesn't let my skin plump and juici as it used to. I don't doubt about the goodness of the ingredients, is a good formula and you will see how nice your skin gets , but in my case.. is about plump thing. * I wasn't one to use moisturizers consistently but my skin was getting dry patches so picked this one up at a discount on one of the deal days.  So glad I discovered it.  My skin soaks it up immediately so it's not greasy feeling at all.  My skin seems softer and more even after using it.  I just bought my second jar. * I have very sensitive skin and hesitate to change up on products, but I kept running out if my former moisturizer quickly. I found this in-store and decided to give it a try. My skin yearns for moisture but I didn't want a moisturizer that is heavy. I was using a lighter moisturizer for day and using a heavier cream at night. This does an excellent job of moisturizing both day and night. The moisture hangs on all day. My make-up glides on easily in the morning. I can now use one product instead of two, but I am considering trying the night cream. I have been using this for two weeks and I can see a difference in how my skin presents. It looks healthier. The lines arent as noticeable and the skin is more hydrated. I will keep using this product."

Great for dry skin * For a while I had small little bumps on my cheeks and forehead before I started using this moisturizer. Once I switched to this after hearing about it those bumps VANISHED! My skin loves this stuff and its affordable. Its on the thick side so a little bit goes a long way :) . * I have combination skin, and my t zone hasn't quit since middle school! This is a light, non-comedogenic moisturizer that is especially nice for when my skin is a little irritated. There's no bells and whistles; and it won't be moistuizing enough for very dry skin. Unfortunately, heavy moisturizers cause breakouts; in fact, I can't tolerate TO's rich moisturizer. When used with targeted toners, serums, and retinoids, I find it adequate and soothing. Light enough to use before a sunscreen, too. * I love this moisturizer! I feel like the bottle has lasted me forever, even with me using it 2x a day for almost six months. It soaks into the skin well, doesn't clog my pores, and is a great starting point for flawless makeup. It is a little heavy at first on the skin but always soaks in well. I do have to use an SPF on top of this so thats really my only Con! * Ive been using it for years now and its the only one ill use moving forward. Mixes great with other products and has helped with dry undereyes. * I love this product so much and has helped my acne tremendously * I started using this a few years ago when it came out, is one of the only face lotions I can use that will not spark an eczema flair, yes menopause changed my skin, and this works well.  My young adult kids use it as well and no problems. They have tried many other ones. Dermatologists do recommend this as well since there is not a lot in the formulation than can cause break outs. I am allergic to fragrance (in the skincare realm that could be anything, you don't know till your face tells you). The price point is good."

I have older skin with texture and was looking for something to help with a better make up application and more smoother appearance. I do think it has helped. * Bought a small jar thankfully & it isn't adding moisture to my face? Nivea lotion works better?

I used to have issues with my skin barrier and many products made it worse however this product was very gentle and hydrating. I even used it on my 1 month old baby after the peeling of his skin. * I used it when my skin started getting really dry and flaky.after using this it started healing.i would suggest using this with a hydrating toner as well for better results.for brown skin it leaves like a white cast for few minutes * I have very sensitive combination skin and at first this stuff made my skin look hydrated but after a week my skin started breaking out. Also didnt wear well under my foundation. * I love this product. I recently started using the retinol serum from La Roche, and I also love the serum. However, of course retinol can be irritating and drying, and this balm is amazing to use in combination. I sandwich the cream over my toleraine-retinol-cicaplast combo, and it has made the retinol process so much easier. Days after and nights where I do not use retinol certainly need the soothing formula as well, and I love mixing a bead of this balm with my moisturizer. It keeps my skin looking hydrated and glowing, but not shiny nor oily. Truly a welcome addition to my consistent routine! * i honestly love this cream so much and i dont even know where to begin. it helps with blackheads, those bumps on my forehead, dry skin, etcetcetcc! literally my secret to glowing glass skin * It does a good job moisturizing dry skin, but the smell is so offputting that i never want to use it.

It is a good moisturizer, but won't feel greasy for the rest of the day. No sunburns yet! * It isn't too greasy but doesn't sit well under makeup and made me breakout, even when using without makeup. * I have been using this product daily for years. Every time I begin to debate repurchasing (due to the price point), I get mistaken for being 24 even though I'm 30. I always end up back at Ulta getting another bottle. It's very moisturizing for how thin it applies to my face. I never feel greasy or like my skin can't breathe. I swear by this product... worth the money! * I really like how this moisturizer makes my skin feel. Great to have high SPF the without it feeling heavy or sticky! No breakouts or irritation. It works well with the Dermalogica Intensive Moisture Cleanser and Daily Milkfoliant. I'm very happy with this product. * I wish I could hate this because of the price but this is a great product. My skin is extremely sensitive and most facial sun screens make my face burn when I am in the sun, this one does not. It works great, goes on easy and doesn't bother my face. * This moisturizer is truly great! I love that it saves me an extra step in my skincare routine with the SPF 50. I feel genuinely protected from the sun wearing it. I am someone with combination skin, dry, normal and oily areas, especially near my T zone and chin. I love how lightweight this feels on my skin compared to other SPF products, which feel overly thick and greasy. This moisturizer is very light and absorbs quickly, leaving a dewy look on the skin. The only things i dislike about this product are the smell. To me, it smells bad. It has a slight sunscreen smell, but theres another scent to it i cant quite place that im not a fan of. That, and i have to use several pumps to get it to cover my face and neck, so it seems like i have to use quite a bit of product at any given time. This wouldnt be an issue if the cost wasnt so high! I wish these products were more affordable because theyre amazing for sensitive skin. All in all, its a great product, and i will continue to use. I will definitelt be waiting for a sale before i buy again though. * I have been using this moisturizer for 8 years! I love it! Like really love it. I am pretty loyal to dermalogica. This moisturizer is my go to everyday without miss. My skin is normal to oily in the t zone. I have never had a break out."

Age: 26 * Leaves my face soft and radiant.  Not greasy or sticky * This moisturizer is just what my skin needed! I had a bad reaction to a retinol cream so I decided to try to this product and it has changed my skin within only a couple of days! My dryness is gone and my skin looks more even. I'm very impressed with how quickly this has worked for me. It's a thicker cream so a little goes a long way! * Uuuugh, I really wanted to like this product. It smells clean and goes on nicely. But it broke me out, some of which were those deep under the skin type of zits. * I have very dry skin and some fine lines I get self conscious about, this moisturizer definitely does its job! My face feels very hydrated after use and I have honestly seen a lot of improvement on lines around my neck! The product does feel a little thick applying, almost like a layer on top of your face if you use too much but that is my only complaint! * Upgraded my skin care products and chose the perfect brand! This product only takes a very small amount and takes care of the face and neck. My only issue is it doesnt absorb quickly so I have to really rub it in. But after 1 day of morning and night use my skin is not red and patchy looking anymore. Very gentle on the skin and leaves my face feeling firm and tight! * This stuff is fantastic!! I am pretty picky about my skincare products. I just bought my 3rd jar. It doesnt take much. The 1.7oz jar lasts two months, using it on face & neck. It almost comes to feel like a serum when it's being applied. 
Im coming up on being 50yrs-old this year, & this product is one of my Top 3 Favorite Moisturizers. I have dry skin & this moisturizer by itself makes my skin feel hydrated. 
It legitimately firms your face and neck, both. A few minutes after applying, you can pat/tap on your face & feel the results - skin that bounces back. Hexapeptide 8 (aka Argireline) is a great firming compound & it's listed toward the top. 
I use this day & night, & add over it a slightly heavier moisturizer for overnight. 

Try it!!"

this was the first product I had from philosophy and I will be returning to buy this for myself and others ♡!

As someone who has sensitive dry skin but still has acne this did not break out my skin and made me look glowy. However, it takes a while to dry even sometimes it's still not dry in the morning. It can make you feel greasy if you apply too much. A little goes a long way. I would recommend this and is my go-to moisturizer. * lovely texture & absorbs quickly but, keeps your skin hydrated & dewy all day * I recently suffered a barrier break after overusing koji acid soap and leaving it on too long. After some research I bought this in store. My complexion is almost back to normal and it didn't break me out. Irritation,redness &dullness almost gone. * This is a great moisturizer it leaves my skin hydrated, smooth and glowy it's gentle on the skin and doesn't have any added in fragrance. * Should I do my serum, snail mucin and then the all in one cream, in my morning and night routine? * I tried this product a few times, several months apart each.

Worth the extra money * Feels so nice on your skin. Absorbs quickly and doesn't feel heavy. Has a nice herbal (light) scent. * For reference I have combination acne prone skin. This moisturizer is wonderful. It's lightweight, doesn't break me out, has a nice subtle scent, lasts awhile, and moisturizes wonderfully.

Ive been looking for moisturizers for my oily skin and this just didnt help, my face constantly felt greasy. * i have oily skin that clogs so easily and this doesnt hurt it at all. Most oily skin moisturizers feel stuffy and clog your pores even if they do say ""non comedogenic"". Feels so light and pure on your face. * It pills. If you don't like that, move along. HOWEVER I have been prescribed azelaic acid, which pills in nearly all formulas. Since I already have pilling going on, This moisturiser is nice. It does almost all the things it claims. The 'All Day' claim is not accurate. My t zone will break through by the middle of the day. Other than that, its nice: no smell, spreads nicely, and it keeps my face matte. * It broke me out all over my forehead and nose.

My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy! * I can't believe it took me so long to find this amazing product. I will have it a part of my skin routine forever now! Such a great lotion for my whole body. Highly recommend purchasing if you have dry and sensitive skin. Game changing product so excited I found it! * As someone with dry and flaky skin, I've tried countless lotions over the years, but none have worked as effectively as this one.

Great size for travel. * I'm disappointed becaude thevreason i got this dacial moisturizer is because i remember getting a facial dobe at a spa in the wibtertime a few years ago and this is the moisturizer they used. Not sure uf the formula changed or its just me but it definitely does not feel the same on my face as i remember. I remember being very hydrated and moisturized when i was given the facial, even the next day, whereas when i put this on, it feels like it disappears right away. On top of that, it is very scented like soa, which I don't like walking around and smelling my face all day. On top of that, as soon as i put on the moisturizer, it made my eyes feel the smallest sensation of burning a little bit. Will not be reourchasing again. * This is my favorite dermalogica moisturizer! This is probably my favorite skin care brand!! Pricey but totally work it! * This moisturizer is very hydrating.

HORRIBLE. * I received a sample of this in one of my ""free gifts"" around the holidays. I loved this!! I went to a CT event at my nearby Ulta & had my makeup done & overall was very impressed with the products. So i splurged and bought the larger container… was told it would last 4-6 months… the container was empty before my 60 day return period was up. I used only in the mornings, too. Made me so sad since I spent so much so I returned it. Had a few other of her items where the same thing occurred. The products are not as ""long lasting"" as far as getting your money's worth. Be wary. Its a great product, though. $100+ is a lot to spend on something to not even get 2 months use. :( * I have been using this for 2 months now and it hasnt made any difference in my skin, especially in my redness. * I was so happy to receive a sample size of the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream from Ulta Beauty. I have heard so many positive testimonials and read lots of reviews about Charlotte Tilbury magic cream and how wonderful it is. I wanted to try it out for myself. I was extremely impressed with how moisturizing and hydrating this silky smooth cream glides onto my face and quickly absorbs without making my face feel sticky or greasy. This gives a youthful glow to my skin without feeling or looking overly oily. This is a perfect base of moisture before my makeup routine. Charlotte Tilbury magic cream did not peel or make my sunscreen or makeup break down. I noticed that my skin looked firmer around my eyes and forehead after applying. I love how my skin feels like satin so soft after using. I'll most definitely will purchase a full size. * Every Charlotte Tilbury product I have tried has been amazing.

I'm in my forties and get compliments on my skin all the time. I don't really have lines or wrinkles, but this keeps my face smooth and firm. The only con would be that it's heavily scented. I don't have sensitive skin, but can see the fragrance being an issue for those that do. Fantastic cream, though, and worth every penny. * Must be loaded with fragrance as my eyes were totally fogged by cream, even just on forehead.

Using this 1-2x/day in just a few weeks my skin was visably smoother, not dry, no iritation, and well hydrated! This does not have a strong smell and does not cause my skin ANY irritation. I cant wait to try more BYOMA products as this was my first and I am so very pleased. * The moisturizer is my favorite because it is do light wight and si hydrating! I will allways get this every time it rums out! * I absolutely love this moisturizer,ever since I started using it my skin has been so much softer and smoother. * This product gave me dry patches and caused me to break out. I would avoid this if you have sensitive skin since it also made my skin irritated. * This is a really great, inexpensive, straigthforward, everyday moisturizer. I alternate between this and another brand with BHA for my mild acne. This has done really well even on my combination and breakout prone skin. My skin seems soothed after using and after a few weeks of use my skin seems a little stronger. Also feels really nice in the fridge after sun. * The first time I used it, I went to my parents and told them I put on the new Byoma moisturizer/skincare. The FIRST thing they say is: ""Why does it smell like vape? Were you vaping?"" (I dont vape and never will) It just doesnt smell good. I dont know what it is that makes it smell that way, but overall, it's very good and doesn't leave your skin all sticky and uncomfortable! 😭☺️"

It moisturizes, reduces redness, and makes my face feel smooth. I mix it with protini and marula oil and my skin loves it. No break outs. I recommend it! * This was singularly the best overall moisturizer I have ever used. It only takes a small amount to cover your clean face, and the benefits are felt into the next day. I will definitely buy more products from this brand! * I mix this with my sunscreen for great hydration. Works as primer for makeup or on my no makeup days.  It is thick but blends easily, helps hide pores as well. I live in a hot, humid climate but have been able to wear this with no problem or discomfort. Little goes a long way. If you have slightly dry or dry skin, give this a try. * It gave my skin moisture, but within 10 minutes of applying, my skin produced more oil than normal. Sometimes it would pill after I would sweat during a workout. Overall, for the price, I dont think it does what it says it does. Would not repurchase. * I had a terrible experience with Drunk Elephant Bora Barrier Repair Cream. As soon as I applied it, it started to burn and my face broke out almost immediately. Within a few hours, I developed an itchy rash that was really uncomfortable. The cream itself is super thick and feels like a heavy film on my skin, which only made things worse.

I'm talking the skin was RAW, flakey, and irritated. All bad. My best friend recommended this to me and I got results overnight. My skin was calmed, and the irritation decreased by 50%. I'd never even heard of this brand, but am so thankful. Highly recommend, and I will likely keep using it maybe twice a week because it is on the thicker side. * Ive noticed my skin barrier to be more sensitive and tried a lot of skin barrier creams but this one is life changing within the first week using it. I get ezcema around my mouth and this has helped me so much and I used it everyday. High recommend! * I have eczema, extremely sensitive, dry, flaky skin, especially my face my whole life. Tried everything out there, paid tons of money, always go back to vaseline! Over 2mths, been using Avene cleanser & balm. I just started to add Cicalfate cream to the balm for extra moisture & I don't have to double up with Vaseline anymore due to my extreme dryness. Not one sensitive, allergic reaction. It does go on white but it's smooth, creamy, skin absorbing & all day moisturizing. Skin isn't tight. I pay extra attention to my eyes. Able to apply makeup! This line is life changing for me! I highly recommend this to anyone with skin sensitivity. A little goes a long way! I use it am & pm. People have noticed & complimented my skin. You just know by the way your face feels that it works & skin is moisturized, not dried & flaky! Smooths out any fine lines & wrinkles. I've never repurchased products but with Avene, I have back up! * When my eczema or contact dermatitis flares up to the point when plain water burns and stings, this is one of the only things I have found that has NEVER caused pain. It is thick, occlusive, and helps heal the area over time. Great to use around the nose too for cold/flu/allergy season. * I actually like this product. This was my first time buying it, and I was really freaked out by all the water that squirts out every time I used it. When I saw a few reviews here that mentioned it, I decided to use it anyway. Makes my skin feel very nice while using a retinoid, but it is super thick and greasy (probably moreso than formulators intended since so much water has come out of emulsion) so I only use it at night. I'm definitely concerned that the product is damaged or compromised. * I have battled constant flair-ups of perioral dermatitis and rosacea for years. I have taken so many prescription antibiotics and creams. Nothing ever helped. Not one time did a doctor ever say, ""Let's work to get your skin barrier repaired because it's so damaged that this cycle is just going to keep repeating itself."" I came across this product from a TikTok video and decided to give it a try. Within ONE WEEK, my skin cleared up,  and I haven't had a reoccurrence in a month. My skin looks better than it has in years. * Just like many other people here, this product is truly a holy grail. Particularly for my perioral dermatitis, which had been getting much worse recently with the change in weather. 

Also like others, my tube initially came with some watery excess when first opened. I scoured the internet to find a solution and found out that if you place the tube in a hot glass/bowl of water, the product will completely melt and resolidify WITHOUT any excess water. Before you send it back, I would try this. This product it 100% my new favorite and now I dont need to worry about the first day wateriness!!"

I have pretty sensitive skin, and it hasnt broken me out at all. * I really like the texture of this cream, it feels very smooth. It is thick so its easy to put on too much. I do echo what others have mentioned about it pilling, the key is to give enough time for all your products to absorb and don't over apply. * My skin is hydrated now that I've been using this product. * This year one of my goals is to really work at a skincare routine… I started 3 months ago with a retinol and a niacinimide serum just using a very basic moisturizer. It was pretty heavy and made my skin feel heavy.
I got the FAB firming cream because of the reviews and figured I could combine certain steps of my routine! I've noticed a big difference in softness, and elasticity of my skin since I've started using it.
The texture is absolutely amazing, doesnt feel thick but does feel moisturizing. I dont wear a lot of makeup anymore, but what little I do lays very well on top of this. No pilling. At little goes a long way!
There's a lot of good things to say about this moisturizer but I'll leave it at this! If you're thinking about trying it, go for it! * I received this is a Fab,Fit,Fun box and i love it! I have supet dry skin in the winter and by the second day of using this ive noticed a hige difference. I can actually put on foundation now witjout my face peeling off. Plus the peptides are nice to have being over 30. * Normally love First Aid Beauty, and I assumed this would be similar to their night cream, but this made my skin super itchy, couldn't use it at all.  Isn't it supposed to be for sensitive skin?  Had to give it away almost unused, bummer."

I saw the regular Moisture Surge with SPF so I figured I'd try it.  I just couldn't wear it because i am very physically active and  when I perspired, perspiration streamed into my eyes and really stung. I was able to get a refund and purchased a larger size of the Moisture Surge Intense, which they did have at the store (a different one).  But the lady who helped me was very rude, abrupt and indifferent. I will address that with Ulta.  
Regular Moisture Surge is 5 stars. * I received this as a sample.  I've been a Clinique user for years with one of the reasons being no strong scents.  I had to immediately wash this off because of the strong perfume scent. * I'm a Clinique girl because people tell me I look better the older I get. My kids too. Diet, exercise, and Clinique are what I credit. * I LOVE this product. I have dry, sensitive skin & my skin just glows after applying. Now that I've taken my skincare routine very seriously, I do my best to stick to products that work. 
To clarify: I am a melanated woman with dry skin, no fine lines/wrinkles. I enjoy this product b/c it provides the moisture I desire & sun protection (after getting sunburned on my face in 2020 for the first time). 
I love the ""sunscreen smell"" b/c it reminds me of the beach. I recommend applying right after washing the face in the AM. If you need to re-apply, use a cotton pad with micellar water to remove oils & dirt first. Splash water on your face & then pat dry and apply.
I stopped wearing full makeup daily, simply b/c my skin looks better & I have less pimples and blemishes.
Give it a try if you have dry skin. However, if you wear liquid foundation…it blends poorly (at least under MAC). * I'm so glad Clinique came out with a good moisturizer that includes SPF. I love their moisture surge moisturizer and now I can skip putting on sunscreen since it has it in it . * I like the product but since my skin is very dry I need something that adds more moisture. * I have used the product before and for some reason didnt replace it. It moisturizes my combo aging skin well.  Will buy again."

Always liked their daily moisturizer but i have oily skin so it didn't help, but this oil control moisturizer helps a lot. My skin doesn't look as shiny. Perfect product for summer. It is not heavy at all. * In my search for an oil-free moisturizer this was recommended. I used this for a month and loved it. No breakouts, controlled my oily skin and seemed to work really well. So, I stocked up and got more. I noticed something was different after the 3rd use of the new jar. I started breaking out. I haven't broken out in almost 3 years. I was confused and continued to use it because why would it start breaking me out now? I loved the first jar. I'm not sure if the formula changed or if my skin is just being finicky. 

Overall, I recommend the product because it seems to be very good. It's a struggle for us oily girls to find products that offer us a balance of hydration while keeping oil at bay. I hope it works for you if you try it :) * Ever since Neutrogena discontinued their Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin - my holy grail of moisturizers - I have been desperately searching for a replacement that will keep my breakouts under control without over-drying my skin. The search is finally over - this is it!! My skin starting clearing up and looking healthier after the first overnight application! I've now been using it for 2 months and it's continued to significantly reduce my breakouts (in frequency and duration) without drying out my skin. The only downside is that the container is about half the size I was assuming it would be, based on other FAB products I've purchased. (Although that's on me for not looking at the size printed on the front of the product.) Each container lasts me a little over 2 months with one application per day on my face and sometimes neck and/or chest. Honestly though I'm in love. * Ive used this product for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin and have used several different face moisturizers over the years and this is the only one that keeps my face from getting super shiny by the end of the day, even with serums underneath it. It WORKS so to me its worth every penny! * This is the best moisturizer I have ever found for my oily skin! I have an oily t-zone and this keeps my skin from becoming oily all day. I worked an 8-hour shift wearing this and when I got home my forehead was still dry, but not peeling, it just felt finally normal. I use this on my entire face, but keep in mind you can use it only in certain areas that you struggle with oil, so don't let other reviews about dry skin deter you. With winter coming up I may begin to only use this on my oily areas and another moisturizer on others, but this is literally the holy grail moisturizer for anyone struggling with oily skin. * I have combination skin and this has saved my skin texture and made it so soft. The consistency feels so nice and it's not overly drying even in my dry areas. Feel like it's reduced some redness as well. * If you have oily skin this paired with the Oil and Pore Control Mattifier Broad Spectrum SPF 45 PA++++ works miracles. I started using it as a combo a couple of months ago and when I tell you My skin has never been better. I would produce so much oil that i wouldn't last an hour before i was an oil mess but using the moisturizer with the spf has helped so much i go through out the day with pretty fresh looking skin. Totally recomend!!!!!!"

I was convinced by a saleswoman at Ulta to buy this product after not changing my skin regimen for years. I had a complete breakout of rash in 2 days, would not recommend to acne prone or sensitive skin ppl * Bought travel size to try - so glad i did and didnt pay for a large  size! 
Product separated so liquid came out and
 then a little watery product . 
I emptied container into a small tub to try to mix liquid into product - didnt work well.
Tried the product - it made my face itchy and didnt seem very moisturizing. After a couple of hours, my skin felt tight and dry.
What a waste! * Have purchased multiple over the past two years, they've recently switched to a cheap flimsy plastic cap that doesnt even stay on the bottle. For almost 60$ I would expect the cap to stay on. The lotion also seems much thinner than the last one I purchased. * This has a weird texture and is hard to rub in. It's like cold butter that won't spread and the whole chunk just moves around. It's like it takes body heat to work. It also stings, which is very rare for me and I do not have sensitive skin whatsoever. I bought the travel size and will not repurchase. * I'd suggest this brand of product to anyone looking to achieve cleaner more radiant skin!! * This moisturizer absorbs quickly and felt really nice texture-wise on the skin. Unfortunately like other reviewers after 30 seconds or so my face burns like crazy and turns bright red. No breakouts as a result so far, but this obviously isn't the product for my skin. Also, the letters on the bottle rub off onto your hands and if you aren't careul you'll get black specks on your face from it. * Been using this for over 3 years and nothing else compares!!!"

I have oily skin and probably spend upwards of $1K a year on products trying to find things that actually do as they claim, and this is one of them.

I was a little reluctant to purchase this as the price is pretty high for a brand I've never used, but I'm glad that I took the risk on it.  Prior to this moisturizer I was either using none at all (because most others just make me more oily, dont need redundant products on oily skin), or I was using the La-Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Matte one which didn't do much for me. Obviously how this will work for you is going to be different for everyone, and the other products you use prior to your moisturizer will make a difference as well.

For reference I am a 28 yr old female, white/Caucasian.  My morning routine is: wash with a clay based cleanser (Dermalogica), tone (Fenty Skin), hyperpigmentation serum (Good Molecules), niacinamide/zinc serum (Sunday Riley), then this moisturizer. The consistency of this product is great for oil as it is a gel based product, but it comes out more opaque white than clear which is fine. It does not have much of a fragrance that I have noticed, but I'm not sensitive to fragrance so I wouldn't be one to say. When I put this on it almost feels as if it is a crossover between a moisturizer and a makeup primer that blurs your pores.  Now it does not make your pores go away by any means, but it does HELP.  Immediately after applying my skin is definitely mattified but again, not completely shine free as if it is a primer with the sole purpose of making your skin look like it has powder on it. It does not make my skin feel tight and dried out, it genuinely makes me feel moisturized and smooth without the glowy look that normal moisturizers do. From my experience it definitely does not keep me matte for 8 hours, I would say after about 3-4 hours I start to see shine on my face to the point where I feel the need to blot if I were going out somewhere (this is all without wearing makeup or anything on top of my morning skin routine, I work from home).

If you truly have an oily/combo skin type this is not going to be your holy-grail product that makes all of your problems disappear (will continue to search for it), but if it is within your budget for a product of this type then this is 100% top 5 best moisturizers for oily skin on the market right now in my opinion after having used this for a few weeks now.  Would repurchase (and I rarely ever find products I do)!  

I also just want to throw out there that I did buy this on my own, was not asked/paid to write this, and I think this is either my only review I've ever written on Ulta or one of a few over a span of years that I don't even remember. * The packaging is very luxe but the pump feels like its empty and its still half full. It doesn't mattify anything but it is a nice mix of a gel and lotion and a lightweight moisturizer. This is an MLM and I do feel it's overpriced for what it is. It's pretty basic. * Matte effect that works great as a moisturizer/ primer for oily skin types"

I use the cleaner and moisturizer daily and alternate the toner/retinol using them once every few days. I have been using these products for about a week and i have chemical burns on my face and sever dryness on my forehead and cheeks causing my skin to peel. I was excited to find this brand because it was affordable and clean jngredients but now i have to return it all and get a new brand. * I like this moisturizer, it is lightweight and natural however it didn't do anything special to my skin (i have normal skin). It is an average moisturizer but the price is good for a moisturizer. * I used this moisturizer for at least 4 months, and it's alright. It moisturizes and hydrates, but it doesn't do anything special. I would recommend this if you want minimal hydration and something VERY lightweight. * I love this moisturizer. I have combination skin and moat moisturizer make me extremely greasy/oily. This one is perfect. I use it everyday and it hydrates my skin just enough to be nourished but not too greasy/oily. * Great, light weight but hydrating moisturizer. Does not make my face feel greasy in the summer heat * Very lightweight and doesnt feel oily at all, actually feels very nourishing and leaves my skin looking soft and plump. Great price for the amount of product, Only downside would be theres no spf! But other than that my fav moisturizer on the market :) * It was very light when it comes out if its pckaging but its a bit of a struggle to blend and after it dried it feels like grease on my skin and makes it really red, in the morning i can see it pilling on the sides of my mouth. :("

A must for dry mature skin! * I found my face and neck skin was becoming much more dry than ever before.  I am 73 and had oily/combination skin most of my life.  Recently that has been changing.  Clinique's Moisture Surge Intense has been the answer to my problem. * I've got extremely sensitive skin and this is the only thing that keeps my skin nice. It's hydrating, healing, and seems great on eczema prone skin. It's so worth it. * I accidentally bought this instead of the 100 hour clinique moisturizer. It has a greasy feeling and feels like it sits on top of the skin. I tried it 2 or 3 more times but the moisturizer migrates into my eyes and it burned my eyes pretty bad. Not a fan, I'll keep it to use for my neck/chest but not my face. * This was the drink I needed for my skin this winter. IDK? why it has such a low * raiting? It soaked in amazingly and it feels smooth, practically facial cream.. It worked in as little as 2 days my skin plumped up No more dry patches. I will always have this on hand, and Of course it's clinique So, you know it won't burn or break you out! I highly recommend this product for people that have dry skin and wanna look refreshed & plumped again!! ♡ * Got this as a gift its really hydrating but almost too much it made me incredibly greasy definitely shouldnt be used as everyday moisturizer and more just as a trearment * the product is great"

It really holds up to its name. I've been looking at this brand for months and finally got it. I've only been using this for a little under a week but this by far, has been the best SPF moisturizer I've EVER used. Someone who works at Ulta said this was a really great product; she was correct. What sold me is when she said it holds up really well for people who have oily skin, which is an issue for me so I have an issue with products that make my skin extra oily. This is very lightweight and worth the money. I just need to see how this holds up with this FL heat. * I thought this was the perfrct match for me as i am lazy and hate having to layer moisturizer with an SPF and get greasy quick. This dries down matte at first but within an hour or so is super greasy and makes my face very shiny. For the price I expected better. * I tend to find most sunscreens to be greasy, oily, or sticky even when they claim otherwise. I assumed this would be the same especially since its a sunscreen moisturizer combo. However I was wrong!  The texture and finish is so so lovely. It's very lightweight and glides on nicely, moisturizes without leaving me feeling like a shiny greasy mess! It's perfect under make too. Highly recommend! * It is weightless but it burns yours eyes terribly when you go to take it off ...and it's not sweat proof...for the almost $50 this is I expect more out of a spf moisturizer. There are drugstore brands that can offer the same for a way less price point. Definitely returning. * For some reason, every other facial sunscreen I've tried either made my face red and hot, had a sticky texture, or made my skin bumpy and textured afterwards. This is the only sunscreen without any of these issues! It feels like a regular, lightweight moisturizer in every way, and washes off easily without any texture or stickiness. * I love this moisturizer! it's super lightweight and there's no strong spf smell. it doesn't feel like i'm wearing anything and it doesn't break me out at all (like most sunscreens normally do) * Unfortunately this is a miss for me. The texture is that of a mild moisturizer, which is great, but the chemical filters in this sunscreen leave a lot to be desired. It has a sunscreen smell that lingers, and also stings my eyes."

I thought my face was purging but after two months, I couldnt take it anymore. Its been 3 months sonce stopping and im still trying to recover from the skin damage it caused. Not all skin types are alike but I think less basic skin care is probably best. The eye balm is nice and works with awaking but I also think it made my dark circles worse. * My favorite is the so polished exfoliating scrub, but all of the products complement each other. I look forward to washing my face now! * I have only used the moisturizer and toner so far but I love them both.

But I noticed after several weeks of use, I had many blackheads on my nose and chin. I didn't realize it wasn't non-comedogenic so that was on me for not paying attention. If you have acne or get breakouts, I wouldn't recommend this. * I wish the people who get the products for FREE other wise known as influencers would just be honest. I found it no big deal I've used other products for alot less money, but the 5 ⭐ crews won't be getting free stuff if they don't give a high score. Wait a few weeks to buy it and if you don't like return it, so this is an HONEST review. * Love it!! * I highly recommend this! I kept finding moisturizers that either broke me out or pilled on my face (deal breaker). This one does neither and keeps my face moisturized. It is on the pricey side, but I bought it on sale. The only thing I don't love is the smell. At first it just smells like nothing, but once I rub it in it's almost a chemical smell? Not sure, but I'll take that over not breaking me out. * It goes on like silk and makes your face feel soft and smooth. Feels good after I put on my toner and serums and then it's like a nice after finish. Good smell. Overall the best moisturizer I've used.

Really helps to repair my skin barrier and does not feel heavy on the skin at all, very hydrating. * This is my holy grail moisturizer, I use it year long and will never be without it! I have somewhat dry skin that is sensitive and if I use too heavy of a moisturizer I can get those pesky white little balls of grease or bumps. But if I use a very lightweight lotion, it doesn't do enough for my face. So it's always been hard to find the right combination of moisture that it not too heavy. This has a wonderful mild scent, the texture of the cream itself is fabulous and feels luxurious when you use it. It sinks into your skin without leaving it feeling greasy and it has great ingredients too, plus comes in a glass jar. I do wish it was more of a pump or something I didn't have to use my fingers with but it's still totally worth it for me. I am 51 so I am not sure how much it is helping with wrinkles but I think it keeps my skin in great condition and I recommend you try it if you have problems finding the right moisturizer like I did! * leaves my skin super soft and a perfect bouncy yet firm feel to it, has been an absolute game changer for my skincare routine * I've got sensitive, oily/combo skin and nothing has impressed me more than this moisturizer!

The ingredients alone are phenomenal! * This moisturizer leaves the skin glowy and plump looking exactly as advertised! If you don't already have oily skin it may feel a little too lightweight; I have acne-prone combo skin and find myself wishing it were SLIGHTLY more hydrating however it hasn't caused any more acne or sensitivity and seems to agree with my skin. On days where I feel extra dry I've been applying a thicker moisturizer on top and I haven't noticed any pilling. * I love this moisturizer. I hate the bottle it comes in. I can appreciate some beefy, luxe-feelin' packaging as much as the next guy, but this heavy, thick glass bottle makes it a stupid hassle to use the second 50% of the product inside it.

I started using this when I had a really bad rash and acne on my face due to over washing and high humid whether. It kept my skin moisturizered while it healed and did not cause more skin issues.
Pros: light, moisturizing, good for my sensitive skin, no smell, does the job in spring and summer months when humidity and heat is high 
Cons: too light for cold months, small amount for the amount you get and the cost but it does last for a season or so * Even with 30 per cent discount, way too expensive, especially for cost.  Many less expensive, just as effective alternatives. * I have rosacea.  I've been dealing with a huge flareup for the past 2 months.  Pustules, extreme redness, and a damaged moisture barrier.  I finally got the pustules gone, but the redness was still terrible along with my moisture barrier.  For whatever reason, my go to Cetaphil was not doing its job.  Read something about this Avene stuff, so I decided to give it a try.  Wow.  WOW!  Not only did it get my moisture barrier in check, it calmed the redness down CONSIDERABLY!  IDK what's in this stuff, but it's magic.  I will continue to buy! * Wow! Ive tried it all, seriously I have. My mother in law has the most precious skin shes 60 and if you see her shes Better looking than any celebrity, yes even Aniston, but she gatekeeps her skincare. One say i saw her getting an avene moisturizer out her purse. I bought it ofcourse. TODAY, three days after i bought, my friend looked at me and said ""Youre skin looks so Beautiful, so soft and flawless"". UMM MISS GIRL, I HAD TO RUN to give this GEM A REVIEW! Like COMMONNNN GO VIRALLLL NOWWW so they never discontinue it * I have rosacea and this is my go to product that doesn't irritate my skin!!! Absolutely love it!

I have been using the same skincare regimen for years and my skin finally needed a change so i bough the light weight mositurizer, milky toner, gentle retinol, yerba mate eye cream, and hydrating gel cleaners, and zinc SPF. I use the cleaner and moisturizer daily and alternate the toner/retinol using them once every few days. I have been using these products for about a week and i have chemical burns on my face and sever dryness on my forehead and cheeks causing my skin to peel. I was excited to find this brand because it was affordable and clean jngredients but now i have to return it all and get a new brand * It worked for me at first, but after a week or so into it I started to breakout really bad. I think I got an allergic reaction to it. So just be cautious! It's still a good product. (Do NOT overuse) * I bought this in hope that it would help with acne scars, and instead of helping my acne flared up so bad. I had been acne free for a while when I purchased this product, but it all came back and took me a while to get rid of again. I tried this product about 3 months later just to know for sure that is what caused it and all my acne came back again. I do not recommend this for people who have had trouble with acne, because you will wish you never bought it. * I've used retinol for years. This retinol cream did nothing for my skin after regular use for almost a year. I kept waiting to see results and switched from my previous retinol product to try this out and it was highly disappointing. I'm switching back. Don't waste your money. * I have such sensitive skin and can never use retinol products or pretty much any products other than gentle cleanser and moisturizer. This is a very hydrating cream that leaves my skin glowingggg. helps with acne scars. helps with reducing acne (ive only had a little bit of purging not much at all), and helps with wrinkles. love love love for gentle retinol. * I will update this once my skin has gone down and I've spot tested. I'm not sure if I used this too soon after using a chemical exfoliant (24 hrs) or if I'm potentially sensitive to an ingredient. The application felt awesome and my skin looked hydrated and nice. Unfortunately I woke up with a swollen and puffy face. My under eyes, which I did my best to avoid were super puffy, which leads me to believe I'm allergic. * If your young then definitely start with this. But if your okder youll need a stronger one"

I think this product is great for someone who doesnt get clogged pores easily, but that person isnt me. * This moisturizer is alright, there are WAY better options that deeply hydrate the skin without leaving it irritated. * I love this moisturizer for my combo/oily acne prone skin- age 35. I use it for my day time moisturizer, and my face seems to be less oily at the end of the day. * i love this moisturizer & so many other bubble products. they genuinely are so good & great for any age or face! * A wast of money * 10/10 would recommend. 32F. I have textured/dry skin. I've spent some MONEY on skincare. This is my first review that I've ever left on a product because it's AMAZING. Sunday Riley is my second favorite, but this beats it for the price point. * I bought this because I absolutely loved their other moisturizers but this one is not moisturizing at all and its sticky.

This is absolutely fantastic!  It is expensive, but I will never go back to my even more expensive Lancome cream now that I have found this gem of a product! * Have been using this as my night cream for the past month and have definitely noticed my skin looking more youthful. My skin looks more plump and smooth. I'm 40 years old and was shockingly called ""young lady"" today at the store. Only downside is that this is expensive so I will wait for coupons/sales in order to repurchase. * Love the product.  It helps fight the dryness of my skin, and it feels wonderful going on. * I have spent years and a fortune searching for a moisturizer that would help my dry skin. Nothing worked until I found this!!  It may seem a little pricey but it actually works and it lasts a long time. One pump is enough to cover my face and neck. I won't do without this and hope they don't change the formula or discontinue it!! * This is an excellent cream to use during the harsh winter months in Chicago. My skin looks and feels so hydrated! Also love that it dispenses the correct amount to ise on your face! * Love Dermalogica, but this is a huge miss. Very thick and sticky - it's like putting heavy sunscreen on your face. You can't put this on then go straight to bed as your face sticks to your pillow. This stickiness also feels itchy. So many other great Dermalogica products that feel much nicer on the skin and do a great job * I got this product on sale for the yearly (or bi-yearly?) ""love your skin"" sale. I've recently started using it and was amazed at how well it hydrates my skin and keeps my face from peeling after using tretnoin. I highly recommend it."

I wouldn't recommend it. * I started using this morning and night and I have seen a huge difference in the luminosity and hydration of my skin. I have already repurchased and will again. Love this product and brand. * If you are very dry-combo and want a moisturizer that actually hydrates you need this in your life. I have tried about every moisturizer known to woman and this is the one!!! * I got this as a gift from someone, and let me tell you that this moisturizer is A GAME CHANGER. For reference I'm 30 and have always had extremely OILY skin. They say you still have to moisturize even when you have oily skin so I began using this at night. This cream is so soft and easy to use over top of any other serums, eye creams, etc. I wake up and my skin is glowy and healthy. My breakouts arw pretty much non existent at this point. My acne scars are less promient and my skin looks so much better under my makeup and the makeup applies so much smoother. I use this with Peach and Lily Lactic Acid Serum and the Oasis serum and this routine is amazing. My oil production has balanced out so well, and I dont get as shiny throughout the day anymore! I am obssessed! Highly recommend! * I love this. It gives me 100 hours of moisture no lie! I use in the PM. My face feels so smooth and plump in the AM. It's great over makeup."

First off there is not much product given considering it being almost thirty dollars. When applied to the face, it blends in well and feels very think and greasy and after about fifteen minutes the feeling goes away. However, as soon as you rub your face after applying it starts to peel horribly and looks/feels like dead skin. If you are a makeup user, this would be a horrible cream to get as it will make the foundation application horrible do to the peeling. If you have dry, sensitive skin, do not wear makeup, don't have sensory issues then this will be good for you. * I have sensitive skin and so it is difficult to find products that are right for my skin. I was pleasantly suprised with this moisturizer. Ive been using it for several weeks now. No irritation, No redness, and No breakouts. I would very much recommend. * This keeps my skin moisturized without the greasy look with no break outs! * I have oily skin, so normally I stick to gel moisturizers. However, I was recommended this by my dermatologist as it is good for repairing the skin barrier. This is an affordable product and goes on well. Its not too thick. I can feel it absorbing into my skin (which is refreshing) and it lasts all day. I have not had any issues with pilling. Finding a good moisturizer is hard, but this has been my go to. I use it morning and night, and it doesn't leave me super oily throughout the day. * This product pills like no other and even when using it on its own, it does not absorb well. Everytime I used this, it doesnt absorb or dry down, it's leaves a layer of film on my skin and it PILLS. I've tried mixing it with other serums like HA, but did not work. Finally, i mixed it with castor oil and it works well enough. Clogs pores too, breaks me out on my chin area all the time. Theres better moisturizers. DO NOT BUY. * this stuff peals ! not worth a penny if you ask me ,I will be returning this item * It helped me with my acne 3 years ago and I had very smooth skin. I hadn't changed the bottle in almost a year and felt no difference. Then I realized that it has pore clogging ingredients (acne clinic NYC website) and i was distraught i was wondering why my acne was flaring up again after almost 2 years of having relatively clear skin. I don't know if it's because they changed the ingredients but it hasn't felt the same. And after washing my face it would have a burning feeling. I'm disappointed because I thought this brand was safe. Please be careful if you're acne prone like me"

I love the way it moisturizes and doesn't leave a greasy feel. Skin on my face feels so soft all day long. Had to buy a full size and now the gift one is in my travel bag. * My mother bought this product and I noticed it had a strong fragrance to it. Now I'm not a dermatologist, but I have enough knowledge to know that anything fragrance is horrible for your skin. Anyway, my skin broke out in hives when I tried this product, along with acne. Please don't buy skincare from Lancome, it's not the best for most people. * I love how this looks on my skin! It's matte but hydrating. Happy that it has hyaluronic acid as well.

This will now be my go to! * I have normal to dry skin, but a lot of moisturizers will clog my pores if i sleep in them. I just stopped wearing a mositurizer to bed altogether for a while for this reason. When I saw the ingredients in this I became curious and decided to give it a try. My skin is so hydrated and looks beautiful in the morning! Also, if i develop a blemish during the day, I will still slap this moisturizer on top of it at night and not only does it not make it worse, it actually heals it and my skin clears up so much faster!

Unfortunately I loved it, and now I'm forced to spend a fortune on skincare. Use with their vitamin c, primer, foundation and translucent powder and your aging face will thank you, but your bank account won't. * I love juice beauty's products so I couldn't wait to try this product! I used it night cream the first night I got it and woke up and washed my face and placed on the day cream. Moments afterward my face began to feel very itchy and uncomfortable. If I would itch it would leave scratch welts all over my face (what it looks like when a dog jumps up and scratches you is the best way to describe it), followed by an itchy sensation from my head to my toes. Once I would itch I would get little hive bumps and the scratch welts all over my body. Very sad this product did not work out for me, but wanted to warn others that have sensitive skin. * This moisturizer is very thick and seems to be a great product with the exception of the smell. It is a vibrant apple/lemon like a candy. 
Reminds me of a teenage type product, unfortunately it is to potent to use at night, to try to fall asleep it just keeps me up. * I love both the day and night moisturizer. The day is light and great under makeup, the night is thicker and really hydrates my skin. They also smell great! * I had such high hopes for this product, but so far I am not as impressed as i hoped I would be. The price is kinda high to be honest, for the amount of product you get! I do love that it is natural ingredients. The fragrance was so strong though which was unexpected. It smells like lemongrass oil or a lemon head candy. Im not really a fan as i prefer light to no scent in my skincare products. Also it is way heavier of a formula than i was expecting, so I had to use a good bit of product to cover my whole face and neck area. And i feel like it just sits on the surface of my skin. The Daytime lotion was just as thick and hard to spread as the nighttime formula. I am not sure if i want to keep it or return it 😕 Don't really love it, or hate it it is just Okay. * Absolutely love Juice Beauty skincare. I can't say the same about their makeup, but these moisturizers are a win! The scent probably isn't for everyone… I've gotten used to it, but didn't love it right away. Very happy with the product performance, though. * This product is the real deal. 100% worth the price. My skin is tighter and it glows! I've gotten so many compliments the last few months.

Despite tbe bery heavy rose scent, it's hydrating & soothing for dry skin. I have dry skin & a midly oily nose area. I recommend washing the face with an unscented clear facesoap, patting dry with a face or other towel & applying immediately. I noticed better results when applying after washing/cleansing my face. This is great for mornings & even mid-day if you wash your face after sweating. 
If the scent is too much for the daytime, consider using it at night on top of a light serum. Be careful, it contains Hyaluronic Acid & irritated my skin when I accidentally used it on top of another serum with the same ingredient. (Avoid any acidic serums, just in case.) I have melanated skin with no wrinkles or fine lines, but I do have hyperpigmentation from some acne scars. It works great for me, despite my sensitive skin.
CONS: I dont like the way liquid foundation blends on top. I only use MAC, so I'm unsure how it sits underneath other brands. 
Enjoy! It is pricey, so def use your points! * I originally tried a sample of this and absolutely loved it. Have already repurchase multiple times now and the big jar lasts me a while. The smell is amazing not too strong but just enough of that clean rose smell. Its thick which is great for my dry skin & had no problems with this. * I used to love this cream but they changed the formula and after using I immediately got zits all over my face. I thought it might be a reaction from changing creams but after a few weeks of use my skin is even worse. Do not buy! Waste of money! * I've tried a lot of facial moisturizers over the years and I keep coming back to this one. It smells amazing. It feels light yet very moisturizing and is a great base for my make up routine. I have acne, prone skin and rosacea, and this lotion has never caused me any issues. I highly recommend giving it a try! * Definitely love how thick it is, and creamy. But the downfall is for the price… the cream should not peel on your skin after it dries.

However, the Lancome fella was so knowledgeable and personable. I do wish it was a little thinner to make spreading easier. * First of all, its such a tiny tube. It didnt apply as smoothly as I hoped. It is very rich, possibly a little to rich for my skin.

I will say, for someone like myself who had oily combo skin, this might be a hit or miss for you, but for myself personally I didn't mind it at all :) * My sister-in-law got this and I've always wanted to try it and have it my own and I love it 😊 * Smells terrible and goes on like flaky paste.

I bought this on a whim and I'm so glad that I did! I use it everyday either on its own or under my makeup. I have light, sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. This product blends well over my other skincare and doesn't feel heavy. Its also beautiful under makeup. I'll keep repurchasing. * Took me a bit to get used to this product esp after using city block spf 40, but is now a staple in my everyday morning routine. It blends really nice into the skin after warming the product up with my fingertips. Thats the key is warming the prodcut up in your hands. I love how it has just a little tint to bring down redness; with a little concealer and transparency powder on top, it creates a beautiful finish!"

I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy! * I can't believe it took me so long to find this amazing product. I will have it a part of my skin routine forever now! Such a great lotion for my whole body. Highly recommend purchasing if you have dry and sensitive skin. Game changing product so excited I found it! * As someone with dry and flaky skin, I've tried countless lotions over the years, but none have worked as effectively as this one.

The lotion has a rich, creamy texture that absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. My skin feels immediately hydrated and smooth after applying it."

Have been using for quite a while now. Makes my face look and feel amazing! * I have an auto immune disease and I have been trying to figure out how to deal with super dry sky. Additionally I am low in vitamin D and C.  Tula did the trick. I used this after washing in the morning and it has been a game changer. I did use it at night also, but I have since added the bedtime bright, I only use this once a day. * This moisturizer is much too thick and did not spread easily on my face.  I prefer their other moisturizer."

The texture of the cream is light, but applies very oily on my skin. I have not noticed any difference in my skin. * I would recommend this but if u have combo or oily skin be advised that it caused a slight irritation on my at times oily chin. but so dewy and long lasting it may take a little getting used to. overall pleased * Its so good you naturally want to smother yourself in the citrus scent moisturizer but trust me, a little goes a long way. * I bought this because it was on sale instead of the regular vitamin c cream and this does have that same thick moisturizing texture but the scent is weird. The fragrance is similar to citrus mixed with grass and dirt? Not as pleasant as I would hope for with the price tag. * I heard so many rave reviews from so many different women that I was excited to give this a try.  First off I really like that SR is clean & cruelty free. I like that this cream comes in a glass jar, the smell is pleasant enough and the texture is so light, airy like mousse. I used this for 6 weeks and here is what I found. For day use after application I tried 2 different primers and they both pilled. Tried  w/o primer with 3 different brands of tinted moisturizers with SPF and it still pilled. So I could not use it for day. So using this for 6 weeks at night I personally did not see any of the promised results. It didn't bother my skin at all but then again my skin is not sensitive, I am over 55 too if that helps.   Glad others love this just not for me. * This is an amaizng product! A little bit goes a long way also! I'm highly impressive quality and how nice my skin feels afterwards! * Please spot test this if you have sensitive skin. I did a spot test behind one ear and had a reaction. It actually burned my skin. Its been 4 weeks and the area begind my ear is still irritated. May have worked for others but not me."

I used to use the Neutrogena Hydroboost moisturizer in high school/college and I had no what my skin was really needing. As soon as I tried this a couple years ago, I immediately knew I would love it. I've tried to find cheaper alternatives and even another high-end brand, but I always regret it and can't wait to repurchase this one. It works really well under makeup and doesn't make my face feel greasy. As much as I've tried, I can't let go of this moisturizer! * This moisturizer is the best I have ever used. My skin is so soft and smooth. The best part is how good it is under makeup. It gives my foundation a flawless finish. It truly is the best I have ever used and I am 54. * I've used Tatcha, Dior, La Mer and those doesn't compare to how amazing this moisturizer makes my skin look and feel.! * This is the best cream in the world. It has magical powers I swear. It has healed my skin, and my friends skin. If you have dry skin this needs to be in your routine. It is not cheap, which is the only con. But if you were to splurge on anything this is THE product. I have tried many moisturizers and nothing compares. It is creamy, but lightweight. It is not greasy and absorbs quickly. It cures dry skin, no exaggeration. Don't even think about it just get it. * I've used this moisturizer daily for 8 years at night and nothing else holds up to the southwest's dry climate. No matter what other moisturizer I try (high end, drugstore, Korean skincare…doesn't matter) I always end up coming back to this one. 

My skincare concerns:
Sensitive
Prone to redness
Hyperpigmentation
Combination skin but more dry"

It doesn't feel the same.  It's greasy and pasty.  After applying makeup, my skin was shiny and oily!
  It doesn't sink into my skin like silk as the other smooth-glow moisturizer does. 
  If you're hoping this version feels like the original, you'll be disappointed. * I got this as a trial size and have been hooked ever since.  It feels so nice after I wash my face.  It's not greasy or oily.  My skin really has looked nice and have gotten compliments.  Don't get the SPF30 with it though.  That was oily and pasty.  I didn't like that version.  I use another Philosophy brand with SPF for daytime use. * I feel like I walkes out of a spa with this stuff on. Smells wonderful- refreshed ans ready!

It's mica on the ingredients * This is a great moisturizer and plumper!  I will continue to purchase this * More than satisfied with this product and I've tried a lot of products. * I received a trial size of this and was skeptical at first so started using only on my neck. After 2 weeks i am already seeing an improvement. The skin on my nexknis softer but more importantly it is helping with my wrinkles and crepey skin! I will finish the trial size and buy more if it keeps up! For anyone using remember that a little goes a long way so if it feels to thick or sticky use less when applying."

You do have to be careful with the amount you use, because this stuff is thick!! Being as you only have to use a little of the product, the amount you get in this container is more than enough to last you at least a year (if only using on your face). I would however only recommend this at night and not under makeup. I feel like it is too heavy of a moisturizer to sit well under makeup. * This product is advertised as clean but the 2nd ingredient is petrolatum!! That is infuriating when people who care and/or have health issues & concerns. I've had people argue with me in the past that there's ""nothing wrong with petrolatum"" and even ""it's healthy""! To those people I encourage you to look it up & let that sink in!.Seriously, I'm not asking you to - gasp - read a book, but Google this nasty stuff! ok * I was hesitant to use this on my face as it has a really thick consistentcy but I decided to give it a try.

It does a great job of moisturizing especially in the dry winter months. * holy grail tbh. vanicream in general is a holy grail and its so underrated. this is way better than all high end moisturizers i have. * This is awesome best lotion * This smooths the skin very well.

Great SPF, feels fine going on but once you start rubbing/massaging into the skin - white swathes cling to dry patches and remain white all day. Over rubbing causes this to pill. Anything applied underneath it causes this to pill. Touching your face causes this to pill. Fabric touching your cheeks causes this to pill.

The consistency is thick and creamy without being greasy! It snells amazing and is so moisturizing. Usually products with sunscreen do not soak in well, but this does. Layers well with other products without pilling. * The product itself is not bad, its rhe packaging that completely ruins it. The entire lid has crumbled, making the moisturizer exposed to oxygen. I regret buying. * I like this moisturizer; at first it does feel like sunscreen going on, but mostly rubs in like moisturizer… but you do have to make sure you rub all of it in or you'll have streaks like sunscreen. It's lightweight and doesn't feel like wearing sunscreen. 

My only gripe is the container. I took it on a trip… pretty sure I have not dropped it, and the inside of the lid basically crumbled. For some reason the lid is made in two pieces (both pieces are hard white plastic), and the inside came detached from the outside when the inside part broke into like 20 pieces. The only thing i can think that maybe caused it was just being in my luggage - it was a car trip, so im the only one who was handling my luggage, and i wouldnt have thrown it down. The weird thing is that I arrived at my destination and used it a couple times before it crumbled. I have no idea what happened, but I'm going to have to transfer it to a different container now because the lid is completely trashed. * Purchased this moisturizer less than two weeks ago and the packaging is already breaking.

Now, it contains mineral oil and has done nothing to help my body breakouts - in fact I feel more greasy and more broken out than before!

I'll be looking elsewhere. * Im not sure if I just got a defective tube but it dispenses as soon as I unscrew the top which is wasteful and messy. The product itself is OK - it does a better job mattifying than a regular moisturizer but I will likely not buy again until I can be sure it is worth the money and not all have an issue dispensing the product. I will likely try something else in the meantime, especially for the money. * I'm surprised by the low rating for this. I have very oily skin, and this keeps me matte for much longer.

Its really great over serums because its locks in moisture. * I am so glad I found this product! I like The Ordinary brand and was trying to find a moisturizer for my 50 yr old skin. This is definitely hydrating!! It keeps me with a glow that I find youthful. * I have eczema and this has helped. I don't get the redness and scaling on my face since using it. * Love, love, love it! * This moisturizer is amazing! Ive been aftuggling for what seems like forever to find a good moisturizer that wasnt scented or full of extra junk. Im in my 40's and tend to be really dry with some patches of oiliness at times and f moisturizer works really well for me. My only piece of advice is to either apply it a couple of hours before your make up, or to use it as an overnight moisturizer as it becomes very sticky on the skin when applied. it takes a long time for the lotion to sink into your skin, but when it does, the effect is perfection."

I think its a perfect cream for dry or combo skin. It doesn't leave my skin too greasy, but rather hydrated. * I recieved a little sample packet of this cream in an order. My skin isn't very sensitive, so I always try out samples. Nice way to discover new products!

After using this product, I had to double check to make sure I wasn't using a cream cleanser. The frangrance threw me off; It smells heavily of soap to me. Like bar soap. I wouldn't perchance this for myself, because I feel like I need to rinse off. However, I love the consistency and would like it very much if it didnt have that soapy smell. :/ * I want to love it bevause its so moisturizing but its very heavily perfumed and makes me breakout * As a person with ""mature"" skin I am happy to revisit this product. I tried it several years ago and it was too much for my skin but these days it is perfect. It's works well under make up and I also use it at night over serums. * I originally purchased the eye cream when Ulta had it on a sale. Then the wrinkle cream came at a great price… I have been using this product now for a couple of weeks and it makes my skin so smooth and soft, and I can see wrinkles diminishing, this is a wonderful product! * Makes skin feel like butter…. So worth it! * I have been looking for a face cream that my face would love for years.  I decided after trying so many products that did not work that I was going to give up.  I had heard that Shiseido was a good brand but never bought it.  This cream is wonderful.  My face loves it.  It is pricey but I have tried to buy several jars when there are coupons or special sales."

I used it for 8 weeks and as soon as I stopped, the bumps went away * it broke out my skibiti skin… rawr * this pruduct made my skin so soft and hydrated I love this and can't recommend it enough! * I love this sleep mask! My only con is it doesnt smell great, but at least it works great. Perfect for my dry skin * Returned, I don't have tolerance for any moisturizers that you can feel after application. This dried down some and I could feel some tightness on my face. Going back to drugstore cerave night * I would definitely recommend. This sleep mask worked miracles on my dry and oily skin. I love this and I will always use it. Totally recommend! * I have been looking for a product to help hydrate my very dry and sensitive skin.

And it was definitely worth my gold coins. * Smaller than the free samples it came with * It is a strong product that must be used as directed. If used properly it will reveal a brighter, better looking skin. * No negative side effects even using it overnight. But I noticed absolutely no difference in my skin after 2 months. It's way too expensive to not show any improvements. * I love this product (this skincare line period). I havent been dissatisfied yet but im always sad when my bottle runs out. My only con is that its pricey but I feel like its worth it and my skin agrees. If I could only afford one thing I would hands down buy this. I recommend using at night because its not really all that lightweight but doesnt cause me to breakout. I can also mix with moisturizer from the same brand (or different) and it does not affect the performance * This retinol does work.  I tried others that I have been recommended and it has just been a waste of resources.  I come back this one which do show results in one day.  I can see my skin fresh and renewed.  Great results and no irritation at all.  Love it! * I've tried a lot of retinols and this the first to really wow me. Not only that but my skin loves it. My normally dry skins feels soft and smooth. This will definitely be on the list for a repeat purchase."

So many pros and positives to this, I use it AM and PM. Love it so much! * I love all of Dermalogica products. This is like a mix of a cream serum compound to me but a cream texture. I have a tiny face and it takes two pumps to get the adequate amount I need for my face and neck. It dries on the skin very quickly but not dries like you cant feel it, dries like you can't spread it. So you have to get it everywhere you want quickly. Then it is very tacky so it should be the last thing you apply. If you apply anything afterwards you will get pilling. All that being said it does wonders for my skin. Leaves my skin glowing and fresh after i use it. It plumps it up and helps my pores as well skin texture. Its an amazing vitC face product. I find it hard to fall in love with vitC skincare products but always want to have one in my regimen. This has been the only one that truly does everything it promises to do. It does have some cons but i just dont use it on days I'm planning on wearing makeup. If you are a daily makeup wearer id recommend using it either hours before or in the evening. You get a good amount for the price. Its got a nice dispenser. Overall i give 5 stars cause not everything can be completely perfect in every aspect but if you get what you want from it can you really be upset. * It does not feel weightless. It makes me skin feel sitcky and stiff/tight. I dont like the feel of it. * I have been looking for a moisturizing vitamin c product, and this product is by far my favorite. I actually use this as a serum, and I put the Dermalogica Age Smart SPF 50 on top of it. It lasts way longer that way and the moisturizing effect is insane. I am obsessed - Dermalogica has done it again! * I put on makeup a couple hours after applying and it totally clashed with my tinted moisturizer, the texture was awful and it's very scented too * I have very dry flaky and sensitive skin and all other products tend to pill on my face. This product has been amazing at keeping my face moisturized all day long and I havent noticed any scent to it. I'm able to rub it all over my face and lips with no burning sensation and it feels lightweight and moisturized. I've not had a single pimple in the entire 2-3 months I've used this product! This product has been a game changer!"

My skin is sensitive and lots of things tend to irritate or break me out. Nothing changed but this lotion. I don't know what's in it that did it, but I immediately started breaking out. It claims to be for sensitive skin, but I'll take the parabens over that. And they've recently taken them out. So I won't be using this lotion. * This is not gentle whatsover!!! It smells like paint thinner and Shea butter not in a good way either.. I was lit up like a red tomatoe.. horrible horrible .. stay away its not for sensitive skin.. adding cheap ingredients and hiking up prices is what most everyone is doing now days.  Nothing is of any quality only for profits.  It's already a super small bottle for a high price tag now its not even worth using if it manages the barrier too.. ughhh * I have severe rosacea and am on the hunt for an affordable moisturizer.  I currently use environ super moisturiser but it is costly. 
I bought this La Roche posay moisturizer and it burned immediately. 
my skin is still recovering as this caused my rosacea to flare up.
I guess I'm still searching for my perfect affordable moisturizer. * Literally the only moisturizer that has put my rosacea at ease. Only downside is it is quite expensive for such a small bottle. * I have dry skin that can be sensitive to ingredients in moisturizers. I use two pumps of this on my face, twice a day after cleansing and serum. I apply serum to damp skin, let it soak in, then apply the moisturizer. Out of several sensitive skin moisturizers I tried so far, this is the only one that never makes me itchy or red. My skin is less flaky and inflamed than usual this winter so I think this is working for me and I will repurchase. It seems to layer well with other products and makeup. * This product.... I cannot say enough great things!! I break out with a lot of moisturizers, but THIS ONE actually helped CLEAR my breakouts. It says on the box it's tested on allergy-prone skin, so I tried it and I'm SO GLAD I did. Also wearable under makeup and great for any time of day. Love this. Just went and bought another bottle!!! * Don't claim to not change the formula when the ingredients are different on the packaging. It burns my face, caused acne, smells terrible. like why. why are brands changing things that are already big sellers???"

Maybe im allergic to something but wont repurchase!! * This moisturizer surprised me in a good way, perfect texture for skin on the dryer side, especially for the price. The packaging however needs to be redesigned ASAP. It will keep me from repurchasing because not only was it hard to get out the entire time, it stopped pumping at some point before l feel like it was empty. * I can fee that the product is moisturizing, but it feels like it sits on top of my face instead of sinking in. I'm using it as a night moisturizer currently, but if I wore it out in the daytime, I feel like I'd sweat it off. Won't be repurchasing. * This moisturizer isnt horrible, but if you have really dry skin I would not recommend it. * This product works well for my combo skin - hydrating without looking greasy but I went through it so quickly. I wont be repurchasing based on the price/ amount paid for. * I wouldnt get this if you have dry skin and are looking for something that has a little more hydration. Typically i like for my moistuzer to have a kind of water consistency to it. It helps with my skin. I'd recommened if you already have a water consistency mosituzer but want more of a dryer in a sense finish to your facial rountine. * THIS IS IT!! I have extremely dry skin and breakout easily. This product provided me the moisture i needed and never broke me out. It is on the denser side in my opinion incase you're looking for something light. 

My husband even noticed how healthy and glowy my skin has been ;) Can't wait to try other products from this brand"

I want a moisturizer that works for both day and night personally. Going back to true belief aqua bomb. * I usually don't leave reviews, but this cream is everything! I've been using it for several months now but I noticed a difference in my skin within the same week. I have very oily VERY acne prone skin with some scarring, and since I've been using this cream I've had minimal break outs which is a huge deal for me. I alternate it with Dime's blue facial oil and my skin has seriously never looked this good. I can't rave about this product and Dime skincare enough, this cream is a must-have!!! * Ulta gifted me this cream and i have to say im impressed!! Ive mever even heard of the brand before and it works soo amazing and feels luxurious!!! I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin. Its plump and very hydrated. * Don't think about it, just buy it. Oily skin friendly! * Finding a product like foundation or cream that doesnt irritate my skin (i have sensitive dry skin, psoriasis, eczema, acne) is a nightmare. I am irritated by hylaronic acid which is in everything now but not this!. I wanted a moisturing night cream with angi-aging properties. When i use this at night i wake up with skin looking plump and feeling refreshed. the TBT cream I will be repurchasing. 10/10 would recommend. * I've been looking for a new moisturizer because the one I've been using for months just didn't seem to be doing its job anymore, and I saw positive reviews for this one. jI didn't realize this was a ""night cream"" when I bought it until I read the fine print on the packaging, but it's part of my daily/nightly skincare routine and my skin LOVES it! It actually moisturizes, and it's just been a week but I've noticed how plumped up and soft and youthful my skin looks. It's so much healthier! A little goes a long way, and you can always pop on a smidge more if needed but it's hydrating."

Its an absolute must have for summer. * This product is super duper amazing. I'm  fair skinned and use sunscreen regularly, but begrudgingly....up until now.  This stuff is wonderful! As noted, there's no white cast, no icky fragrance and feels great on my skin with no breakouts or sunburn. I also like the pump dispenser. very convenient to use. * I normally don't leave reviews but, this sunscreen is amazing so it was time.

Every sunscreen I tried on her burnd her skin till I tried this sunscreen. We never looked back! As a family of 7 I quickly purchased the largest bottle and it last us a summer and a half with frequent use. My husband, children, and I are white hispanics and my niece is a dark hispanic and I am happy to say it doesn't leave that terrible white cast on any of us a lot of other sunscreens leave on the skin. Non of us think it's greasy and it has a subtle delightful sent.

It has not caused any pilling with any of my sunscreens and at night time I apply an extra layer and a hydrating balm. My skin feels soft and hydrated with this moisturizer. * I was really excited to try this as I've tried their snail mucin mask and love it. Not a fan of this cream. It sat on top of my skin, wasn't absorbed, and felt slightly and tacky on my skin. * I enjoyed this product a lot.

Pros: glides onto skin, absorbs quickly, makes skin feel soft and hydrated, lighter feel, daytime moisturizer (not thick enough for me at night).

cons: none that Ive encountered yet (have been using it for 4 weeks) * I love this moisturizer!!! I use this in the winter and when my skin needs an extra boost of moisture! I love this line of Peach Slices with the snail mucin. My skin has cleared up amazingly. When I stopped using this line briefly because my store didn't have any and I had to order it. I broke out.

My face broke out into small white bumps all over after a few days of using. * Wow. I felt compelled to write a review because I rarely have felt wowed by a product immediately after usage. This moisturizing changed my skin overnight. My rosacea and dryness were basically gone the morning after, and i was left with buttery soft, supple skin.

Upon first round of use of this product, the skin around my nose and mouth became painfully dry and flakey. I assumed it was an exfoliating product I was using had burned my skin. I had to limit my product usage for over 2 weeks to heal the skin. Within minutes of my second usage of this product, after my skin had healed, it became obvious what the culprit is. Immeditately rinsed off my face and put moisturizing, healing products on. The skin is still red and dry. Absolutely horrible. Never had this issue with an moisturizer before. * I got this moisturizer to replace a different The Ordinary moisturizer. I wanted to try it because it had great reviews and its been a couple weeks of usage and i have never tried a more drying product period. It feels nice for the first three minutes but after that my skin dries to the point where i can feel every inch if my face move if i try to talk or smile. I hate it so much. * i have very oily skin so i thought i would love this moisturizer, but it is so so sooo sticky. and also once it is almost completely rubbed in, it kind of tugs on my skin. when i wake up, my skin felt dry, not hydrated. i think it felt dry because it is sticky. i hope they reformulate this one day * This ""moisturizer"" made my face feel tight and dry. * First few days, it was great. My skin felt hydrated but not greasy. Unfortunately, I realized it was causing redness & irritation. So disappointed because I really wanted to love it. For some this could be great. Sadly, it wasn't for me. * Bought this trying out new moisturizers as my old one was discontinued. And THANK GOD I chose this. It doesnt feel oily at all, nor does it leave any film or stickyness. It comes as a clear gel but it almost melts into the water I spray on my face for when I moisturize. I was worried about it having perfume and my skin reacting to it, but it doesnt have a strong smell and it smells  clean, and like it has some SPF in there but I could be wrong. I was also worried about the amount of product since you can't seem to find anything that lasts anymore but it has plenty of product, plus I dont seem to need as much as other products, so it works out. This is definitely my new go-to moisturizer, my skin looks more clear and healthy and my redness has even gone down a bit. 10/10, 5 stars, would recommend."

I personally did not experience peeling or any bad reactions, however it does burn your eyes a little. It leaves my skin glowy and dewy, something I strive to achieve with dry skin. I did a medium coverage face with an exaggerated eye look on top of the sunscreen and it lasted all day even in the heat. Definitely recommec * I wanted to love this so much but it pills like crazy!

I dont recommend for the people with oily/combination skin as this can make the skin look oily rather than glowy.

I have not witnessed brightening or firming. A big selling point (and likely excuse for the huge price tag) is the Grand Rose extract, which Lancôme does a poor job explaining the benefit of. Luckily I had Ulta points to use on this cream, and not my own money. I got roped into the illusion of grandeur and prestige with this Absolue cream. Don't be like me. Much more effective and affordable creams are available on the market. Research ingredients; rose extract offers unremarkable and lackluster benefits. Perhaps the Pro-Xylane and shea butter can, but certainly not in this formulation. * This product is amazing! Expensive as heck but amazing. I originally tried this as a sample and noticed a difference from just the sample. My skin has NEVER felt so soft and smooth! Make sure to purchase when there's a 20% off code otherwise it's a lot. * Most say ""it softens the skin""  Goodness ladies, you can ""soften skin"" with products that are free of chemicals and work to soften.. A cream at this ridiculous price should do more than ""SOFTEN"".. I received a teeny tiny sample of it .. Sorry I don't believe one can see any difference whatsoever with 4 drops of a cream with a strong perfume smell.  I have sensitive skin and perfume is not something I want in a cream * Got sample with other Lancôme product. Best moisturizer on market. Cant tell u how many compliments I have received. I know it's pricey but worth every cent !!"

Face remains shiny and the product just sits on your skin. I did not see a reduction in wrinkles and I used it for almost 3 months 2x/day. * I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review~

Absolutely fantastic! I've been using this dual-phase anti-aging firming serum for a few weeks now and I'm truly impressed. The combination of CAMU CAMU, hyaluronic acid, and green coffee bean extract has worked wonders on my skin. Not only does it feel firmer, but the fine lines and wrinkles are noticeably reduced. The texture is light and non-greasy, making it a pleasure to use. I highly recommend this serum to anyone looking for an effective anti-aging solution. * Dermalogica phyto nature firming serum has a lot of powerful ingredients to make this serum amazing for fine lines and wrinkles. This firms up my skin and gives it an overall better texture. It gives my skin a more healthy appearance and I look forward to applying this in the morning and at night. gifted by dermalogica * This is the best stuff ever! So many compliments on my 46 yo skin within the fitst few weeks. It's pricey but worth every cent. * My skin was getting texture/big pores. Also dryness. A ulta representative suggested this cream. He is also using this cream and his face is is flawless so I decided to give it a try. Within 2 weeks I started  noticing glowing skin. Within a month my friends started noticing my skin and I'm receiving alot of complements and friend wanting to know what I'm using."

Didn't feel nearly as moisturized as I did with their Redness Relief Calming Cream, and I don't even deal with redness. I don't know what other benefits it has, but it it's not moisturizing then it's not worth it. * This moisturizer is great! Received it as a sample and wasn't too sure what to expect and my expectations were super exceeded! 
Love how lightweight it is, spreads very well with just a little used.
I've been using moisturizers that are $25+ for years now and this compares with a lot of the top brands!
Very happy with my purchase & will keep buying it! Mixes great with serums from Drunk Elephant & others alike, too. * I started using this product in September of last year. I liked how light it was. I started to get tiny closed comedones all over my chin and occasional deep cystic pimples. Just recently I stopped and it is clearing up. Should have stopped sooner * I got a tester as a bonus and absolutely had to buy a full size. This product is a great balance between price and effectiveness. But please for all thats good and nice CHANGE THE PACKAGING. This type of product really needs a pump bottle or something but this one is so hard to handle."

It's a decent formula and helps hydrate my skin. I've noticed it does indeed peel, however. 

My biggest complaint is the container, a few days after purchase it fell off my vanity and onto the floor and I noticed the jar had cracked, but not broken. 

Then last night I closed the lid on the jar and it had shattered. I got teeny tiny glass splinters in my fingers from cleaning up the mess and had to toss the jar which had half of the product still left. 

Glass jars aren't necessarily classy or luxurious, I don't understand why brands decided to use cheap glass for containers for products they know are going on a shelf or in a make up bag. 

I'm reallt sad I had to throw it away just because of poor packaging. * Not very moisturizing * Doesn't absorb.  Just lays on top of skin. * I'm 63 and tried this for the first time. It's a great facial moisturizer and wrinkle reducer (for fine lines only). It is not greasy and absorbs well into the skin. No redness from the ingredients. My only complaint is that there isn't much product in the jar. That is why I only gave it 4 stars. * I bought the full size of this and was really excited to use it. It felt very greasy and didn't absorb well. Looks awful under makeup. After about 1 week my skin was breaking out horribly. I discontinued use and skin looked great again after stopping it for 3 days. Not for me. * I just finished a bottle of the olay regenerist Whip with broad spectrum 25 and returned back to the Revitalift and my skin just did a happy dance.

It can serve as a night cream if you wish. * I'm glad the Ulta consultant suggested this product * Let me just say, I have used a lot of different moisturizers. Out of all of the ones I've tried so far, this is the best. I have sensitive skin and don't usually struggle with bad acne, but I'm prone to break outs and flaky, dry skin (especially during the fall & winter months). So I've started using this and it actually works! It has totally helped to calm my breakouts and any redness I struggle with and has helped my skin feel smoother, gives it a glow, and just look better overall. It actually does what a moisturizer is supposed to do - moisturize!! It's very thick and feels a little wet and watery when you first apply. But after it dries, my skin literally feels so soft and stays moist all day long. I love it! And the fact that it's actually created to be safe for sensitive skin is a huge bonus for me and is exactly what I look for in skincare products. For those of you with sensitive skin who are looking for a great moisturizer, I highly recommend! * Did a test patch & immediately I felt a burning, stinging sensation. Washed it off but my face was irritated the rest of the day. I suspect it was the Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil I reacted to. * I bought this and did a small test patch. Maybe it's the menthol but it burned & my skin turned red. I immediately washed my face but it was irritated the rest of that day. Thankfully, it was back to normal the next morning. * A good moisturizer and primer.  I love the fact that it is fragrance free , clean and great on sensitive skin."

I love that it doesn't leave a white film over my skin, it just soaks right in. Gifted by Supergoop * This was my holy grail of moisturizers with sunscreen for years. It kept my skin hydrated without making it greasy, had no scent, played well with any eye cream I paired it with and never broke me out. Since the formula change, this has given me nothing but problems.
First is the scent. IT REEKS. It smells like a burning pit and the smell does NOT dissipate. I am super sensitive to scents and the old formula had a slight smell to it but you didn't notice it after you put it on.
Next, the consistency is now a bit chalky and not as creamy as it used to be.
Lastly, the hydration is gone. My skin is dry about 45 minutes after I put this on. Now, that could be mostly due to my skin hating the new formula, so take this as you will.
I hate that I have to stop using this. It was a decent price and worked well for me which can be hard to come by, but I'll sadly have to give it up. * Leave my skin oily and shiny , but i still use it because it was blending good with my make up and wasn't leaving a white cast on my skin until i checked the actives ingredients are not recommended for breastfeeding (actually not good for anyone) and it has a sunscreen smell so  im switching to a mineral susncreen. * This looks like I'll  be fhe first non-incentivized review. I love the unseen sunscreen and was so excited to try a rich cream with spf as i have very dry skin. The texture of the product when i tested on my hand was so nice and absorbed great. However, when I applied it to mt face for the first time i noticed a HORRIBLE smell. It smells like a chemical plant and it lasts the entire time its on my skin.

I LOVE IT!!! It blends GREAT (especially for a product with SPF), isn't greasy, doesn't make my skin oily or shiny, has not caused a breakout, and I can see a clear difference in the moisture level of my skin in just a few days. Anti-aging creams normally make my skin totally freak out, but this one is all good, no bad. Really glad I happened upon it! * This contains Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene....FYI * I joke that this is my old lady face cream because it smells like a bouquet of roses. However, it really does give the skin a lifted appearance and tightened feel. The daytime version has some SPF and wears nice under makeup. I wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin because of the fragrance. Also, I noticed on very dry winter days the product does not have enough moisture for my skin * I received this as a sample size from Estee Lauder and I can't wait to buy a full size. This is why I love samples, It lets me fiind out what I love without spending a fortune first.  It has the faintest fragrance that is subtle but lovely. It goes on so smooth and is just pleasant to use. My only complaint is the price. Some of us would buy this brand more often if we weren't priced out of the market. This is why I gave it a four. Otherwise, a five all the way. * This smells like febreeze and it doesn't go away when you rub it in :( save your monies * I use this product daily.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. It did not irritate my skin, which can sometimes be an issue for me.  Makeup base glides on smoothly over this moisturizer.  It is my absolute favorite. * I wish I could use this product as it seems to work well. However the fragrance is too strong and irritating."

I can truly say that this stuff along with the face and eye serum works. I used to have very dry skin, but not anymore. Also, the hormonal acne I get occasionally is under control. Lastly, the wrinkles are diminishing. Totally worth every penny. * I see smoother skin , brighter skin , less fine lines and an overall younger look * I do love this product, it's true to all things advertised - A little bit goes a long way as I purchased this a few months ago and still have more than half of it left. I did not want to write a review until I was certain I was satisfied based off of the huge expense... 

that said, I wish the product was a bit less expensive because I have tried other product lines that do the same job without the extra $$... but then again, you are paying for the name"

This is absolutely fantastic!  It is expensive, but I will never go back to my even more expensive Lancome cream now that I have found this gem of a product! * Have been using this as my night cream for the past month and have definitely noticed my skin looking more youthful. My skin looks more plump and smooth. I'm 40 years old and was shockingly called ""young lady"" today at the store. Only downside is that this is expensive so I will wait for coupons/sales in order to repurchase. * Love the product.  It helps fight the dryness of my skin, and it feels wonderful going on. * I have spent years and a fortune searching for a moisturizer that would help my dry skin. Nothing worked until I found this!!  It may seem a little pricey but it actually works and it lasts a long time. One pump is enough to cover my face and neck. I won't do without this and hope they don't change the formula or discontinue it!! * This is an excellent cream to use during the harsh winter months in Chicago. My skin looks and feels so hydrated! Also love that it dispenses the correct amount to ise on your face! * Love Dermalogica, but this is a huge miss. Very thick and sticky - it's like putting heavy sunscreen on your face. You can't put this on then go straight to bed as your face sticks to your pillow. This stickiness also feels itchy. So many other great Dermalogica products that feel much nicer on the skin and do a great job * I got this product on sale for the yearly (or bi-yearly?) ""love your skin"" sale. I've recently started using it and was amazed at how well it hydrates my skin and keeps my face from peeling after using tretnoin. I highly recommend it."

It is thick yes but keeps the moisture in and doesn't sting. Love it. * This is only my second day using this product and I was going to wait longer to review it but every time I use this cream I am amazed at how my skin literally drinks it up. I have combination to oily skin. Acne prone skin since I was a preteen. I recently reintroduced a retinoid (about 2 months ago) to my night time routine (every other night) and my skin has been feeling so dehydrated and oily at the same time… so ive been on a hunt to find a hydrating cream. Something that doesnt sit on my skin and definitely not something that I have to constantly reapply bc my skin feels dry again. 
I know the texture can throw some ppl off but I love it. If nothing else has been working to hydrate your skin, GIVE THIS A SHOT! * I previously wrote a positive review, but after a couple of weeks of use, I have to update. This moisturized well, but it consistently caused a breakout. It was a zit in a different place every time I used it. Maybe this would work for someone with less acne-prone skin. * Yes, it has the consistency of glue. I personally would only use it at night. That said, it really soaks in after a few minutes and I wake up with moisturized skin. Very reasonable price for this effective, cruelty free product. * Works great; a very nice, hydrating cream. However, I probably won't be repurchasing because its consistency was thick and felt like glue. * I received a product sample as GWP and am so thankful. Have been struggling with sensitivity to anti-aging ingredients resulting in rash for a few months, and now eczema. This product is so soothing and moisturizing. It is the only product I've found that helps and does not irritate. 

The color is weird (gray-lavender). Consistency is almost like white toothpaste. A little goes a LONG way. I saw lots of comments about pilling. If it pills on you, you're simply using too much. 

I will be buying this as soon as my sample runs out."

After just one use my skin got very dry itchy and inflammed . And i notice 2 breakout after just one use.

Its keeps me moisturized but its no different than a Olay product for half the cost. * I'm in love! after just 1 week of using this, my almost 45 year old skin has never looked better. It took a day or 2 for my skin to adjust to it. Was a little itchy at first but that has gone away. I can actually FEEL my skin tightening up and feel the quenching. I can't wait to use it every day. Amazing! * I really wanted to love this moisturizer. It is very thick and perfect for my nighttime routine. It would be amazing for winter months. I actually also love the scent of it. It makes my skin feel completely moisturized and looks glowy afterwards as well. Unfortunately I have dry, sensitive skin and it has caused severe breakouts all over my face. For the price I paid I'm disappointed but always a risk I take when trying a new product. * I was hesitant to buy this cream. I have tried so many different brands that promise some of the same things. Then I tested a small amount on the back of my hand in store. I was shocked, it even made my aging hand look better.
I pulled out my Ulta card and purchased, thinking I will try this one jar and see. I was still skeptical.
I have been using this for 2 1/2 month and notice a huge difference in my skin. I HIGHLY recommend this moisturizer. If you are on the fence, take the plunge. And yes, I am telling my friends about this (at least the ones I like)! * This is a really great feeling moisturizer. Goes on smooth and leaves your skin smooth. * I always thought moisturizers don't do much considering they tend to just sit on top of skin unlike serums so I never invested in a moisturizer… but after reading the patent ingredient and other ingredients I wanted to give this a shot. First time use I thought it was okay. But on day 3 my skin was already glowing and texture and lines looking softer!!! I never thought I could get that popular Korean beauty glass skin look but this is it !!!!! I am shook and obsessed with this now. * I love fresh and had been using the rose deep hydration cream before i purchased this bottle for the anti aging benefits.  When you first apply, it looks so smooth and plump, like wearing the best primer.  After just 4 days of use I'm already noticing the firming effects and see some of my fine lines looking softened.  Im a believer.  I use the black tea anti aging ceramide moisturizer every morning and night."

I used it around 10 times and thought it was sunburn because I was red and sore. I switched to e45 then another brand and I was fine. I then tried it again after a couple of weeks and it stung my face again! I usually don't have sensitive skin and I'm gutted I spent so much and now can't use it * Every single thing on my face 'balls up' when I use this moisturizer, including when I use it alone.  It does not absorb into my skin, but just sits on top. I've tried it in so many combinations and it's just incompatible with other skin care and foundations (I've tried several foundations -high end & low end- with same results).  I've also tried using it with serums, different primers, different sunscreens and alone with the same result. This is a hard pass for me. * In my early adulthood i had terrible acne and skin probs. I tried proactive and everything at the drugstore, nothing worked. I found Kiehl's and my skin turned right around and I've never had a problem since. Im willing to pay for good skin care, but this price still hurts. My skin would feel waxy and really greasy for a long time which aggravated my pores, which in turn aggravated me. It doesnt feel moisturizing at all. I feel like i just wasted a lot of money. Kiehl's let me down for the first time : ( * It goes on creamy and smoothly, and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks so good. Been using this and all Kiehls products for many years. * This was extremely irritating to my skin. It started to burn and little pimples developed. I had to wash it off immediately.  Fortunately, this was a sample product. I will never be purchasing this item! * I got a free sample of this with purchase from Ulta and I greatly appreciate it but this really Burns my skin especially around my nose. I read reviews from other people that had the same irritations. I have no idea what is in this cream that burns and stings for hours. * Really sad about this cream because I thought it was gonna be the holy grail. But I have seen no difference in my skin and it burns when I apply it (I don't have sensitive skin at all)"

Cannot figure out which ingredient i would be allergic to. Put Cortizone and neosporin all over my face to calm it down. * Just seemed it wasn't worth the money. It didn't last all that long.

I never get full blown whiteheads nor blackheads just a few congested / closed comedones (always same spot).  In almost 3 weeks, no returning comedones plus comfortable hydration & smoooooth skin.  Be patient & of you have that stubborn/mild acne on NOT oily skin, this is for you! * I have been struggling with super bad acne lately and nothing was really clearing it up.

Would not waste your money. * I loved the fact that it had hyaluronic acid and SPF in one, but after putting it on, I realize it's definitely not for me. I hoped the reviews were wrong, but it definitely leaves a white cast over your skin, and made me look super pale, despite the fact that I have a fair, medium skin tone. * I have tried almost every mineral sunscreen under the sun. I'm fair skin, freckles, burn easily, break out easily and this sunscreen moisturizer has been amazing. There is a white cast initially but I rub the product between my fingers before applying and it blends within 5 minutes! I never get sunburn on my face while wearing this. I also apply a ceramide barrier serum beforehand and do not experience any dryness while using this product. Would absolutely purchase a cool toned tinted version of this. * I like this sunscreen for days inside where im not too worried about reapplying. This sunscreen feels great on the skin once rubbed in, but its a workout to do so. I'd give this more stars if it wasnt so hard to rub in, which is why i use it on days I'm inside. It also gives a slight white cast but it does go away quickly. Otherwise, it's very moisturizing and doesnt feel tight on my dry skin even if i forget moisturizer underneath. * I like the product don't need a lot if  too much is used it will leave a white shade  that's the only thing I don't like but keep in mind that it's also have sunscreen maybe that's why it's white .  I will keep using it. Since I use less products. * This is a great sunscreen. It can be applied as a morning moisturizer. However, the product is very thick when rubbing in and does leave a white cast. It does evebtyally soak in but does make me look paler. 
Doesnt clog my pores. Still love it! * The white cast this leaves is so bad its almost impossible to fully rub in and then if you sweat it sweats off completley white. Its a nice light consistency and doesnt burn if it gets in the eyes which is good but the white cast makes it not worth it considering how many other SPF options tbere are."

This is still very heavy and thick, i even went back to look at the ingredient list to see if it had SPF in it. This would be great for those with dry skin, but if you have oily skin and want something like the moisture bomb gel cream, this isnt it. To me, the name is a little misleading. * I have struggled FOREVER finding a good moisturizer. I have extremely acne prone skin, and a ton of moisturizers break me out or give me fungal acne. I use this in the morning since its a lightweight moisturizer and it leaves my skin feeling nice but not greasy. I have combination skin, it used to be more oily before I started going to a dermatologist and was put on a topical that tends to dry me out. I do prefer a thicker moisturizer at night, but I will continue purchasing this one over and over! * I love the honest product line and use many other honest products so i gave this a try. 

It leaves my skin really shiny, i can feel it on my face, almost kind of oily, and it looks thick in the container but when you put it on its super thin and watery. For it to feel so useless and thin and watery and still make my face feel gross and oily is beyond me. Definitely wont be using again. * Great moisturizer. I really like how it has a water like texture after applying so it feels extra hydrating and soothing. My skin is very reactive so seeing it was EWG approved made me want to try, I wish I found this sooner!! * The texture of this is insane and so unique.

Do not buy. Zero moisture benefit. Feels and looks like you are applying green concealer tint all over your face, sits on top of your skin, peels and looks awful. * Leave my skin super smooth and flawless * As past reviews have stated...it is a bit thicker but it does soak in nicely.

While I don't think this product does anything favorable in terms of acne when it's already there, I at least think that it doesn't break me out. It gives the skin a really nice look on its own, and as long as it dries first it looks nice under my other makeup. I prefer a dewier, glossier skin, so it might not work for everyone. My skin is definitely healthier since I started using it each morning. I will probably bite the bullet and rebuy despite the price tag."

I'm halfway through my second jar in a row, and am noticing less smoothing and plumping of my skin than I had before. It moisturizes just fine, but nothing else. * Went to see my Derm and was told my skin looked really good. I took a photo of this Roc product and told her the price. She was shocked yhat it was working so well. Me I'm very happy that it is affordable and works❣️ * It's love from fist use. I can tell that my face has more clarity. After a week I noticed my fine lines are softer even my frown lines became less noticeable. I'm very happy with Roc. I spent hundreds of dollars on more expensive products and noticed nothing of skin improvement, but the result this cream gave me is amazing. I can't wait to buy the eye cream from this version. I believe the retinol in this product has nailed it . It meets with the secrets of skin care beauty. Thank u Roc and thank u Ulta for selling the best for ur customers. * I am 75 yrs old and have never seen any cream work as well as this. I am blown away by it and the difference it has made in my complexion.  I have very few wrinkles for my age and this has done a great job  with perfecting my complexion. * I am a mature woman, and have dry skin, with some dark spots.  This product is amazing!  In one week, my spots began to fade.  Looking at my skin, I notice a fresh dewy look!  Compared to many other products, this is an affordable option, which really works! * My first ever review on Ulta. Buy this! I ran out of an expensive retinol serum, and wanted something more $ friendly and a retinol and moisturizer in one. I've been using for 2 weeks now, and my skin looks extremely healthy. I am also pairing with a vitamin c serum. Now, I know the potency is legit because I dumbly went to use the infrared sauna after I used this. Needless to say I have myself a little irritation and redness because of how potent this was. It goes well under makeup, I don't even need a primer I just use setting spray throughout my routine, and the moisturizer isn't overwhelming. This is my new go to moisturizer. * After reading a bunch of reviews, trying several expensive and inexpensive options, this has finally been the best moisturizer for my chronically dry 46 year old skin. My skin finally feels hydrated all day, no more crepe paper forehead, cheeks feel soft."

I started retinol with my dermatologist but really wanted an alternative to full coverage foundations like mac studiofix and estee lauder double wear, as my skin is happier without heavy makeup. I tried this after seeing my hairdresser use it and it's amazing!! it balances out the pink from my undertones and blends the red from acne breakouts and irritation without there being a noticeable mark. At first I didn't like this product as much because I tend to be heavy handed and applied it like a foundation but when you apply it like a lotion (lightly) it blends in easier and doesn't come off orange around the hairline. * Love it!… I hate to wear foundation. I use this to correct some redness on my chin, works wonders. Ive gotten so many compliments about how smooth my skin looks! * Unfortunately, this product delivered zip, zilch, zero for me.  It did not read orange on me, but also provided minimal if any redness coverage for me.  I tried varying different amounts of product, methods of application-no dice.  I don't write negative reviews based on breakouts bc I feel that is so much based on individual sensitivities, but this also did result in a breakout on my cheeks within a few days of trying it out. * i have very pale skin and redness from acne scars and rosacea. i LOVE this product. it evens my skin tone so well i sometimes dont even need concealer or foundation. i also like that it helps with my acne if im having a break out. i use this everyday * I have significant redness on both cheeks and this product is a blessing!  I have decent skin otherwise so I can easily use this on the cheeks and not have to wear foundation.  I put it on after my moisturizer routine. * I started getting really bad rosacea in my later 20s. I was never big into makeup and skin care - my sister gave me a few things to try and i samples some things store employees recommended but everything just made it look worse but making it still red but now looked like i was obviously trying to cover it up in a gross way. 

In my 30s i decided to do something about it and jumped into the wonderful world of skincare and in tandem - makeup. While trying to tame the flair ups, i tried to find something to cover it up - foundation, skin tints, concealer - all the products marketed to solve my problem didnt. They all made it look worse still…until I found this product from Hero. I found a tiny travel size and thought what can it hurt, ive tried everything else. I honestly couldnt believe it when i put it on after my morning skin care. I cried i was so happy - dramatic, sure, but true…if you have rosecea flair up that have taken over your reality then you might get it. 

This magical elixir tamed the redness in my face while also looking like my skin and didn't make it feel like i had tons of make up on.  this product literally gave me back my confidence while i work diligently to get my skin barrier as healed as possible while living wirh rosacea. 

I also can use it as a primer and then top it with one of the good skin tint products ive found over time for more coverage, but even when just running to the store i throw this on quickly and poof, im no longer so self conscious of my bring red, splotchy face and i feel like a human again.  

Besides the expensive Erborian version, which is pretty solid, but heavily scented and I cant afford, this one doesnt turn me orange like other renditions of this product that are in a similar price point. 

Only issue: i wish it came in bigger bottles"

I love the dewy finish on my skin, but I wouldn't recommend for oily girls. This has Propolis at the very top of the ingredient list, so you know you're getting all the benefits for an affordable price. Not to mention it's fragrance free! I pair this with a peptide eye cream & it has diminished my fine lines * In lieu of my 5 star rating, this product sadly ended up in my ""can't use"" category. I absolutely loved EVERYTHING about the whole Propolis line, but unforturnately Propolis is an allergen tested during an allergy patch test and mine showed a trace reaction which my allergist informed me to avoid any allergens even if it is only a trace. This could be an issue for people who have sensitive skin. I have to say that other than being a possible irritant or allergy to some, this moisturizer is a really great consistency and lives up to all the expectations that it claims to have. As with any product that is new to your skin, proceed with caution and do a patch test. Its worth knowing :) * I love the toner and serum in this line but for whatever reason this lotion is just waaay too much for me. It would irritate my exzema and cause small/minor breakouts. I have dry/reactive/acne prone skin so moisturizers are a challenge for me * My skin loves it! My pores look smooth, its calming & hydrating without looking greasy. A little goes a long way. * I LOVE THIS! My skin took around a week to really settle into this as my face reacts to new things. However once i got into the routine of using this, my pores look smooth, my skin is plump, and is overall hydrating without looking greasy. It also calms down the redness I have on my cheeks. A little goes a long way. I finally found a moisturizer that works for me. * I was hesitant to try this however, it makes my skin feel great.  I use this with a few of the same line and I believe my skin looks and feels tighter and more moisturized! * Decided to switch up my moisturizer just out of curiosity. This one was definitely on the pricier side from what I'm used to, but it's totally worth it! I used to advocate for the Cerave one, but after trying this one, I don't know if I'll ever go back. It's super hydrating and my skin still looks glowy and healthy after a full face of matte makeup. I definitely noticed a difference after adding this cream to my skin care routine. My skin looks so much smoother and healthier than it ever has before."

I notice there's pieces of the blue label gets on my fingers and on my face. * I have combo skin (dry psoriasis around my hairline and neck, and oily t zone) I got this moisturizer in an IPSY glam bag and immediately loved it and came to Ulta to grab one. it's very simple and doesn't irritate my skin! * I bought this moisturizer on a whim and I am OBSESSED. My skin barrier was wrecked, and I was having a major rosacea flare up. Literally nothing was helping, until I tried this. It's a thick moisturizer, but it feels extremely light weight once rubbed in. It gives the most beautiful glow. There is absolutely no scent to this and I live that. My only concern is how small the jar is. I wish it was bigger because this stuff is amazing. 100% recommend. * It was recommended by one of the store associates and it is the bump👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 I like the creamy and thickness that dissolved in the skin leaving your face moisture. * I got this product recommended by one of the Ulta workers and absolutely loving it! It's not as greasy on me and also use it as a primer ! My base looked pretty smooth when using this as a primer. Love it. * I got a free trial size packet of this product to try. I was really surprised by its thickness and creaminess! It has a light pleasant smell and feels very luxurious on the face. It takes a bit to absorb fully but it feels SO hydrating. Definitely will be buying the full size. * I got a sample of it and I love it, I have Rosacia and this has not caused any breakouts or reactions and my skin feels so soft... I want to buy a big jar if it when my sample runs out but still deciding it's pretty pricey"

But the smell was too strong. Says theres essential oil inside but i never break out but i did. Go pay the extra 10 or get moisturizer surge. Also blackfriday and other holidays it goes on sale * I received a sample of this product in a big sample kit and decided to try it out. I had been using The Ordinary Niacinamide + Zinc for the longest time and after trying out the sample there is no going back for me. I had no idea but The Ordinary was causing breakouts which cleared up in a matter of days once switching to this. It makes my skin feel refreshed almost immediately and my skin looks brighter and plumper after just 30 minutes. Normally heavily fragrant products make me break out and cause my face to burn due to my sensitive skin but I have not had this issue at all with this product. It is a refreshing citrus smell which I absolutely LOVE the smell of citrus. After long time use my skin consistently looked brighter and I had less dry skin and fine lines. It is true that it does leave your skin feeling sticky but I always put my moisturizer on top of it and the stickiness is no longer an issue. I highly recommend this product!! * This moisturizer has really leveled up the radiance of my face. I use this as my night cream, and ive been waking up to increasibgly refreshed and energetic skin with each passing day. * My skin has never felt so soft. I also use the scrub so the combination is making my skin look younger and softer! * I have been using this product for years and it was great, but now, the formula changed and caused my face to break out. Will not be repurchasing. * Best light moisturizer for combination skin.  I've used it for a long time and love it. * I love the glow this gives but it isn't worth it due to the horrible pilling. No matter what I do, it rubs off in flakes and looks disgusting. I wish they would fix that because it is otherwise a good moisturizer."

It was so bad that even applying moisturizer made my skin burn. I was DESPERATE. I couldnt really afford going to an esthetician regularly so I did some research and found this line which sounded like exactly what I needed without costing $100+ per product. I was hopeful but I did not expect THIS. My skin redness went down significantly, the itchiness, the burning, all started to go away. My skin feels supple, plump, and even moisturized! I feel like I was always looking for my perfect fit and I think I finally found it! I'm OBSESSED! Thank you Peach & Lily!!! * Firstly, I love Peach and Lily. I see immediate results with their products and am absolutely thrilled with this one in particular. I tend to use this as my night creme, as I do my 'more aggressive' treatments then. It feels luxurious, and I don't mind the nautral scent at all. It is not as 'clean' smelling as the Matcha Pudding, but it definitely moisturizes and calms more intensely than it's counterpart. Absolutely recommend this if you have sensitive skin or have used to many exfoliates or actives. I also think it is great for preventative care. Will absolutely repurchase over, and over again. * This product line (Rescue Party) from Peach & Lily has absolutely SAVED my skin. After experiencing some hormonal changes that les to dry, flaky, and inflammed skin for the first time in my life, I knee i had to try something drastic. I have used Beekman and First Aid Beauty in the past, similar pricepoints, but neither had results like this. I will absolutely re-purchase. * LISTEN. Everyone needs this cream and the serum in their routine. For me, they stop and prevent outbreaks. My skin looks great! HIGHLY recommend. * I struggle with autoimmune issues that cause periodic issues with dry/flakey skin, break outs and redness. This has helped quickly clear up any flare up I've had since getting it. I also use the repair serum with it and have loved the results. I'm not a big fan of fragrance products with how sensitive my skin is, but I do wish there was something to do about the smell. It can be pretty off putting. All in all I'm happy with the product though. * I have combination skin. I love Peach & Lily matcha pudding but it wasn't quite moisturizing enough for the Az climate where I live. I needed something more moisturizing but without the oily effect. This is it. Love this cream. It also helped soothe redness from my rosacea on cheeks and nose. The texture is thicker but buttery which melts really nicely into my skin and doesn't leave me greasy like most moisturizers. Highly recommend. * splurged on this enticing product to heal overly -exfoliated skin. the product feels great on my skin and is indeed comforting, but even after weeks of use and discontinued exfoliating, my skin is still too dry. won't be repurchasing."

The last quarter of it will become highly uncomfortable to dispense and you will end up having to fight for the last couple drops in there. * very light moisturizer, stronger smell than expected (almost minty but it's not?), feels great on skin, but the price point is higher than what I think the product experience is worth * I loved this moisturizer. It had a spa-like smell and soothed my red, acne prone skin. Unfortunately, they changed the formula recently and it now includes niacinamide which I am allergic to. I'm so bummed!

It's super hydrating but lightweight, not greasy, great for sensitive skin, and leaves me with a healthy glow! This moisturizer has helped to smooth my skin especially as I'm dealing with breakouts - gives me better glass skin than some Asian beauty products that claim to do so. Love love love! * A light moisturizer that delivers maximum hydration.  I have always had good results from Clarins products. * This could be a great prduct if they took out the nasty fragrance. It's so bad and lingers on my skin for hours. When I use this one, my cat won't come near me and cowers if I try to oet him.

I now use only at night so I'm not putting anything over it. * I like it. I also drink collagen supplements so i think it works pretty well on top if it. Im only 23 so i dont have wrinkles to begin with but i will say that its pretty sticky going on and if you touch your face while its trying to dry than you will get the 'beads' like everyone else is saying but if you dont touch your face until its fully dry it will look normal * I was hoping this product was going to be my stop to moisturizer search. my skin is extremely dry. it does leave your skin feeling very soft. I wouldn't say I noticed any noticeable difference besides a shiny forehead. the thing I really don't like about this product is after you rub it in and it drys, if you rub your face it peels up its gross......

Wish they'd reformulate it so I could go back to using it again. * I personally wasn't a fan of this product. First I want to point out the sales associates at Ulta are super sexist to men and I got passed multiple times every time I asked for help literally ignored me. But back to this product, it's very similar to sun screen I prefer a thicker face lotion like the 2-1 face & beard but that got discontinued. * After years of using Vasaline Intensive Care lotion on his face, I convinced him to try the Clinique For Men Broad Spectrum SPF21 Moisturizer.  He loved it!  For a lotion with sun scree, it's not greasy and  it absorbs into the skin nicely leaving no residue. * If you've ever had a reaction to a sunscreen this one probably contains your culprit. Wore once and broke out in a rash/hives where it was applied. I will now be avoiding oxybenzone. * Applied it at the store to test it out and also bought some, a few hours later had a giant bump on my chin. Going to rerun it tomorrow. * This is the only product my husband doesn't seem to have a skin reaction to.

With summer coming the last thing I need is a sticky face. Really bummed * It calmed down my redness a lot I have rosacea. This is the only product that works for me so far as well as the peach slices cleanser combined. * Hydrating moisturizer, however I have sensitive skin and after a few days of using the product my skin started to burn and get really red. * soothing and hydrating * i figured i would try this out because i have a lot of redness on my cheeks. it does help a little bit but for someone who has combination/ oily skin, i wouldn't recommend it. it leaves your skin feeling and looking super oily. i'll be sticking with my usual moisturizer! * I work in a cooler all day and ive noticed over the past year that my skin stays red. Im not sure of its aging or the cold air or alittle but of both but so far ive been enjoying the calming cream. I haven't had any breakouts, I haven't seen a significant difference other then my skin feels hydrated throughout the day. Its only been a week though. * This product is OK. It does help relieve redness. It's easy to use and has a gel-like texture. It doesn't have a weird or bad smell, which is a plus.  HOWEVER! It is greasy feeling on the face.  I have combo skin,  and in my dry areas this is NBD. but in my oily areas it is (to me) quite annoying. I bought this product to calm my irritated skin, as the product I went in to buy was OOS and I needed immediate relief.  I gave this 3 🌟  because this may be great for some. just not me. I'll be ordering my usual product online and passing this on to my teenager"

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this specific product from the brand. It has that very strong sunscreen smell & automatically burned my eyes. It is very thick & has a heavy white/blue cast that wont go away no matter how much you rub it in. I gave light skin and noticed the white cast, so I'm sure its way worse for medium-dark skin tones. It is sticky and leaves an oily finish. This isnt a product that can be worn under makeup easily without seperation. If you're looking for a sensitive skin sunscreen that you can slap on your face while at the beach & dont have sensitive eyes, then this might be okay. However, compared to Korean sunscreen I've tried, this one cannot compete. * I am a big fan of the Vanicream Moisturizer and Bar Soap for my sensitive skin, so I decided to give the SPF a shot.

I look for products containing squalane and this has it, however for a ""non-greasy"" formula it stays VERY oily looking on my face. It does not dry down on me. I tried it with my normal skin tint on top and powdered lightly but it still shows oily through the makeup and i dont love that. I used it as a body sunscreen and worked great on legs and feet for our beach trip, used it up that way and will not repurchase. I do love the daily moisturizer (without spf) and jt also contains squalane but sinks in better and does not have the greasy finish like this one does. I will for sure repurchase that one probably as a nighttime cream for over serums. * Perfect mineral sunscreen, hydrating, wonderful base. * This all mineral sunscreen is super hydrating. The amazing formula with ceramides and glycerin really layer so wel over my cream that has b vitamins. I personally dont get a white cast however my skin is light and i use it as a main sunscreen so i still tend to add tinted sunscreen or foundation with zinc and titanium dioxide on top to give me more of a makeup look when i am doing a more full makeup look. Incredible. Wish it was sold in travel sizes or at least available in mini/travel size during the holidays. * it left a white cast on my face, and did not seem super moisturizing * I love this sunscreen!

I honestly it better then even the more expensive, better reviewed competitors (like Tatcha or Glow Recipe). The smell is strong but it works really well and makes my skin glow and feel good. * lightweight, not too glowy , easy to layer with sunscreens * I was advised to try this instead of more makeup to cover red areas on my skin. It worked immediately and just zapped my dry skin issues. My friend, who has suffered from Excema for years saw her redness and itchy skin gone within days. * Came back to do a review update because I'm on bottle 3 of this gem right now and I figured most reviews are done after a couple uses or a week of use. I like to read reviews after extensive use of a product. Okay so after bottle #2 I decided to branch out and try something new (I know we all do it!) so after almost 3 mths of using something else my face lacked it's glow and some of my hyperpigmentation returned around my cheeks and upper lip. I had managed to clear almost all of it up while using this! Stupidly I fell for a video of a different product and switched to it. I just went out and bought this again and already my face feels softer again and I know my hyperpigmentation will decrease again! I won't make that mistake again! This formula does not contain dimethicone which is important to me, I don't want a fake softness to my skin, I want a nourished softness. This is light and silky going on and even with dehydrated, dry skin I can skip a top moisturizer most days. The light smell goes away within seconds and does not bother me at all - strong botanical smells cause a migraine- lucky me! This is not a gel it is more like a serum texture or a light lotion texture, it sinks in pretty quickly. The bottle is glass and beautiful on my countertop, plus pump bottles are way more sanitary than droppers or jars. I appreciate a good pump bottle because I know when something comes with a spatula I'm using my fingers after about a week and a dropper always ends up touching my face or not sucking up enough product so I get mad at it! Come on beauty industry there is nothing wrong with a pump dispenser! Take note!!! I highly recommend this product and pray Lancome doesn't ever discontinue it! 
So if you have uneven tone, hyperpigmentation, dry and or dehydrated skin, aging skin, and dislike dimethicone you may love this formula! * I have been using this product for several years. I began using it during a Summer because it was lightweight, and continued through the year. * I have dry skin and this is a very light moisturizer. So, it's ok during summer, but as soon as it starst getting cold, I needed to double down. I like it's consistency, look and fragrance, but I don't think is worth the price. * I wanted to like it because its lightweight but unfortunately its too light for dry skin."

I always went back to it and my skin looked great. I don't know what they did to this product, but it has made by skin break out with a terrible allergic reaction. This formula is NO good.

Yes I recommend it but I'm allergic to it. * Great team and it works! * Love it * I am due for my Btx, however, I've been using this for 3 days and I can put it off. off.

I was disappointed that it's the gimmicky color changing formulas that start off green and turn tan when you rub it together. It leaves my face looks super shiny and it's almost impossible to put makeup over it. * It does cover red spots but it is so thick it is suffocating. Will not repurchase * I really like using this for my light makeup days its a bit oily but you can use a setting powder to set it * I wanted to like this but I prefer the serum
It does cover some redness but when it drys its patchy. Not good for dry skin * I really wanted to love this moisturizer because it's affordable and has more product than Dr. Jart's cicapair color correcting treatment, but this has such a strong chemical smell and has the consistency of a tinted moisturizer like the other reviews state. It covers my rosacea okay, but i have to add quite a bit for it to cover it up. Don't think i would repurchase. * I never complain about a product but this one was so disappointing. It smells awful. It smells like mildew and looks as if it is expired. It squirted out of the bottle with lots of water and seperated product. I was so nervous to even put it on my face. But I did and it barely covered the redness. I'm not sure if my bottle is expired or if it is just a bad bottle. It is not what I was expecting. If I could return I would. * Doesnt gove much coverage lile the ither color correcting products out there, but what concerns me is mine smells like a wet dog when i apply it every single time. I dont know if i have a bad batch, but the smell os so off putting that ive been avoiding using it at all."

I picked  this up after trying other products from first aid beauty and loving the results! 

been using for about 3 Days now and no irritation or rednessi!!  this will be my go to!! * DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  I do not have sensitive skin and regularly use vitamin c on my skin, this product began burning my skin the instant it hit my face and even though I washed it off immediately, I can feel my skin barrier is damaged 2 days later, water stings my face as does any moisturizer.  Not sure what is in this, but it's horrible.  This product is not suitable for anyone's skin in my opinion and should be pulled from shelves. * I've used this skincare product for a week, and the results are incredible. It stings a bit at first, likely due to my sensitive skin, but the sensation doesn't last long.My skin feels and looks amazing—no need for foundation or concealer. I've received many compliments on my glowing complexion. The brief sting is definitely worth it! * If youve got sensitive skin, go ahead and skip this one. I think there's too much vitamin C in it or something, it makes the formula way too harsh. * Got this a sample for a gift with purchase and absolutely loved! I have noticed my skin be visibly brighter, more firm and looking youthful and plump! ✨✨✨✨ the perfect hydration layered with the FAB ultra repair cream. Feels amazing on the skin, very lightweight while completely moisturizing and nurishing my skin 💛💛💛💛 * I love FAB, and never have any issues using their products on my sensitive skin until now. This burns for about 15 mins after application. * Was looking for a good overall moisturizer that gives me a glow since I do have normal to dry skin. my skin is insensitive at all but this product using it. The first time caused a burning sensation all over my face. I did try using it without any other skin care products, and the burning sensation continued. I stopped using it after the third day, it was irritating my skin way too much.
It did leave my face glowing but Obviously it is not worth the pain."

Even if I take care to avoid the eye area, it creeps in them somehow. Feels nice as a moisturizer but it makes me look more sweaty/oil slick than glowy. Have to completely cover my face with setting powder for my skin to not look wet. * this product provided a good moisturizer for my skin but it left my skin oily. I used it with a hydrating serum after but I also used the moisturizer by itself and it still made my skin oily. It made my face smell like sunscreen but it helped with an initial layer of sun protection. If it wasn't so oily I would like this product. * not my favorite. its oily, and it has a not pleasant sun screen smell. I wouldn't buy it again. * Works well on majority of the face. However, my eyebrows and any contact with the under eyes was insane. Burning, itchy, puffy, allergic reaction type symptoms. Never have reacted to any product and I have had success with neutrogena and other hydro boost products. This one is a no for me personally. Could not continue using knowing the burning allergic reaction/chemical burn feeling on my eyebrows specifically. * This product is hydrating and does absorb into skin well if you rub it in well. It can look greasy and feel greasy because it tends to seperate in the bottle. It would be great but unfortunately it burns the heck out of my eyes, even when I try to avoid the eye area it still makes my eyes sting and water. It also taste like sunscreen. I dont put it on my eyes or lips but so how (maybe because its greasy and also bot sweat proof?) it makes its way to my eyes and lips. I will use it up but i wont buy it again. * I used this product on my oily acne prone skin and have had no issues so far. I personally have been loving the entire skin care line and highly recommend especially for oily. I would suggest using the entire line of products together because they make for a lovely product combination that makes your face feel very clean and hydrated."

I would highly recommend it. * Purchased this product on a whim because it was near the checkout counter. I am so glad that I did. I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have seen a change in the brightness of my skin and evenness as well within the first few days of using it. 5 STARS. * I really enjoy this cream.

It smells great, leaves my skin looking supple, and feels very light. I don't feel greasy or look shiny either. The BEST!! * I love this sunscreen.

Very soothing for dryness without clogging pores * In recent years i've developed excema on my eyelids, chin & ear lobes. I've tried so many moisturizers that claim to help reduce redness and lock in moisture, but it wasn't until I found this product that my skin changed for the better.

First purchased back in September 2022 & still using the same 3 products today.

I remain consistent with this brand, and they have shown me love back, my skin soaks this stuff in and doesnt break me out whatsoever. 

Super gentle and refreshing. One of my favorite pros is that it leaves my irritated and stinging skin, smooth and calm. if you have irritated skin that stings, even when you put your moisturizer on it, this product is definitely for you and will help with that sensation. * This is my favorite Avene product! So much that I finished my first tube and bought two more! It has been very helpful for my dry face this winter and I love using it at night over my serums. * Helped razor burn and is super gentle * It help relieve the redness on my irritated neck, little pricey * This moisturizer is extremely lightweight but really leaves my skin feeling hydrated!!!

I now have little bumps all over my face thats going to be a mission to get rid of. * This moisturizer is does an all right job, I guess. It kind of smells like root beer, so that's not too bad. My one complaint, however, is that it leaves my face feeling sticky. I have to use a setting powder to abate that. * I like Tula products and really wanted to try this one out. I've used the originally moisturizer before and had zero issues , but this one broke me out so bad - even with using a sunscreen as directed. Sorta bummed. * The moisturizer works really well, but there's not much in it. It doesn't even fill up the jar half way. The way the container looks it appears that u get a lot, but not the case. Too pricey for such a small amount."

I have VERY sensitive skin, I get hives on my hands/arms, & allergies that make my face skin dry out/flake in the spring. This has worked better than expensive clinique moisturizers & has been a real life saver in my breakouts. A 'con' is that sometimes it pills on my skin, especially if I'm using the cicaplast balm too. I wish it was more product for the price & that squeeze style bottle didnt allow for so much product left inside when you can't squeeze any more out (I've cut multiple of these bottles open to get ALL the product). I'm going to branch out & try a few new eczema products but I would (& have) recommended this one to other people with eczema & still would probably purchase again. * I suffer from facial eczema and have tried a few creams.  This cream is the best for soothing and providing moisture to my face.  Highly recommend! * I have been using this product for 3 months now and can say that this has worked better than any other products ive used and is much cheaper! Very gentle for the face and body. Will say that if it feels like its not working fast enough I would highly recommend the Lipikar body and face wash to pair with it! Those two products together cleared my Ezcema in less than 2 weeks! * Sadly didn't work out for me, made my skin worse and I was red and breaking out badly * I struggle with Versicolor and have for almost 10 years, the doctors couldnt even tell me what to do to help it. It's very similar to psoriasis, its all over my chest, back, neck and scalp. It is very painful at times and if i'm not careful i can scar from scratching too much. I have gone through lotions, serums, even vitamins I thought would help. This lotion was kind of my last hope before going back to the doctor. The first time i put it on, that was the first time in almost 2 years that my chest wasnt scaly, itchy and red. Theres a little discoloration from years of my skin dealing with this, but it actually looks like normal skin. This is a huge insecurity of mine and now i feel i can be ready for summer and actually wear things i want without feeling embarrassed! * This is literally my favorite all over moisturizer! My face and hands have never been softer * This product is really great for people with dry skin. It works well with my hydrating facial rountine."

It left dark spots on my skin due to burning. I couldn't put anything on for almost a week because it burned so badly. Definitely will not repurchase. I do love other products from Kiehls but this one isn't for me. * I may simply be allergic to an ingredient in this moisturizer as it has many positive reviews, but it burns every time I apply. On a more positive note, I didn't experience any additional breakouts. * In my personal experience (oily t-zone, sensitive dry cheeks) this moisturizer has been excellent. Even though its a gel texture, its shockingly soft and melts into the skin well, not getting that slight stickyness that some gel/oil-free moisturizers tend to have. Im able to use this on both the dry and oily parts of my skin and then I use their barrier repair cream on the drier/sensitive areas of my face and it feels downright refreshing. No irritation but also I dont feel like an oil slick after an hour! No greasyness but still effectively moisturizing, makinng my skin just feel supple and calm. I dont make a lot of money to buy ""luxury"" or just nicer skincare, but I will always splurge on this product as my go-to moisturizer. * I love most Kiehl's products, but this one is the top go-to that's always on reorder. My skin is very oily so a good moisturizer is hard to find. This one is the best I've ever used. It sinks in beautifully and doesn't sit on top of the skin clogging pores. This is definitely not for people with dryer skin as it simply won't be moisturizing enough, but for those of us with oily skin it's a holy grail product. * I love most Kiehl's products, but this one is the top go-to that's always on reorder.

I used a little on my cheeks and forehead.  It went on smoothly.  I liked the way it glided on my skin. I did notice that my forehead looked very shiny after a while and wiped off the product. When I woke up the following morning, my skin was picky and itchy/burnie.  My right eye was swollen on the lower inside lid.  I have a feeling I am allergic to something in this cream.  Will return and stick with non comedogenic creams. * I bought this a couple of weeks ago after having run out of the Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream, and it has not disappointed! I am 35 years old with combination skin (oily t-zone, dry cheeks) and hormonal acne. I really liked the moisturizing quality of the Ultra Facial Cream, but it wasn't a friend to my oily skin. When I discovered Kiehl's made a formula of their popular product for people with oily skin, I decided to give it a try, and it's been a god-send. I use it day and night as part of my skincare routine, and it's a great compliment to my other facial products."

My eyes are very sensitive and many moisturizers, and serums cause them to burn if I use them around my face. Not these and I love the moisturizer for morning and night. * My skin is always dry even after trying other moisturizers the next day its super dry.

After using this product for a few days my face looks like I've got mange. * I tried this once and 39 seconds later my eyes were swollen shut and I couldn't breath, not good for sensitive skin like the bottle had stated. * This moisturizer leaves a white cast and it doesn't sit well on the face, it ends up really patchy. The worst thing is that throughout the day my eyes will start to burn. I've given it multiple chances to see if something else was causing this but without fail, everytime I wear it, my eyes will burn/sting (and this is not from the sunscreen getting in my eye directly). * This is a thick moisturizer and doesn't spread well. Leaves a white cast. * I usually get the regular ulta repair face moisturizer, which is my fav! Decided to try this one with the SPF, its decent however it irritates my eyes sooo bad which isnt great when you are getting ready to do your makeup and your eyes cant stop watering , and does leave a little bit of a white cast."

The fact it contains the stable form of Vitamin C that most dermatologists prefer to recommend is of course THE reason to use it. I also LOVE that they didn't add fragrance to mask the  normal smell of the vitamin C ingredient. Yes, that odd ""hot dog?"" scent is just what the vitamin C smells like, and it dissipates in less than a minute. * Bought this product about a month ago, I was worried at first about spending so much money, but it was time to drop the dime. I'll be turning 35 soon and my skin was dull, dry and sometimes had red patches that would burn when using other creams, correctors and moisturizers. 
Since using this product my skin looks just as young and fresh as it did in my 20's!
I will definitely be purchasing this again when I run out. * Started using this product about a month ago and I love how dewy and hydrated my skin looks. It has also helped with my skin tone.

You CANNOT layer it with anything, or even slighty brush against your skin without it pilling up and getting everywhere. That being said, I have very sensitive acne prone skin, and this did not irritate my skin except for around my eyes, and did not leave much white cast. * I have used this moisturizer for YEARS! I suffer from dry skin and all other moisturizers would cause my face to have little white flakes on it. After I started using this it never happened again. * I was given this as a gift and at first i didnt know it was a sunscreen and used it for a while as just a moisturizer, eventually I looked this up on the app and only realized then. But overall this product is really good and feels great on my skin, one thing id change it the packaging, after long term use the film on the grey cap came off and i had it all over my hands that ended up on my face after i applied.

I have been using oil moisturizers as I thought they were lighter and absorbed quickly. But this cream is super light and absorbs quickly. it doesn't feel greasy and lasts all day. Now I can really feel the difference when I don't use it. If you are hesitant between this product and the triple repair one for extra dry skin I'd go with this one first. The other is a lot heavier and doesn't absorb as well * Again the best body lotion ever! But what to do when the pump won't get to the remaining 4 ounces of lotion. I have a solution! I cut the the top off with a knife, the take a spatula or kitchen knife and scrape it out and into a 4 ounce bell canning jar. Perfect size & then nothing is wasted. * I have the La Roche-Posay face moisturizer, which I love, so I figured I'd give this a shot. I only use this on my arms because they are the driest part of my body and WOW. My arms are so smooth and soft that I might stop using my other body moisturizer! * This is an amazing basic cleanser for any skin type! I have dry/combo sensitive skin that's acne prone and this works well for me. It isn't drying and leaves my face feeling nice and clean. I can use it around my eyes without irritation and that's a plus! It also doesn't break me out which is a huge factor for me. It's also fragrance free. I love the ingredients and how it has a pump that locks. * I really love it will definitely purchase again but like others have said it has a smell to it almost like a cheap mayo smell 😭 it does leave a greasy feel up until it absorbs into your skin but the upside is it leaves your skin sooo soft! * I have been using their products for a while and my skin has become really hydrating. I use it as a part of my morning routine and leaves skin light and refreshing. * Great product and so moisturizing.  The fact that it's thick and doesn't dispense from the pump is a problem.

To my surprise, my skin was only getting worse. It was starting to burn and itch. I've been allergy tested, and I don't have any. The day I didn't use the sunscreen, my skin condition immediately disappeared, so I went to look at the ingredients list. I don't know if Origins is using the oils from grapefruit, lemon and orange for fragrance purposes, but it does not list anywhere that they have extracted the furanocoumarins. After meeting with my dermatologist, I was advised that the citrus oils used in the sunscreen caused photosensitivity, and burned/ irritated my skin.

I do have sensitive skin and this seems to do the trick to balance pH levels. If you have tried other products with no luck, try this product. Not every product fits everyone but this one is definitely worth the try. To me... worth every cent🙏 * 'My daughter is 14 and this product has been great for her acne * I love to try new products so I've experimented with a number of daily moisturizers with SPF like Drunk Elephant and Unseen Sunscreen and always come back to this Murad holy grail. It doesn't leave a white cast, is moisturizing, non-greasy, and doesn't pill under my makeup. I use this daily and a bottle lasts me roughly 4 months. I'm honestly shocked at other reviews saying they broke out as I have acne prone skin and never have but YMMV. * This is a decent sunscreen, rubs in fine and makes my skin soft. However this burns my eyes soooo bad. Obviously I know to not get sunscreen in my eyes, but it doesn't matter how carefully I put it on, my eyes burn. I have very sensitive & dry eyes and it just doesn't work. The Tula one in the yellow bottle, is the one I continue to go back too. * I was very excited to try this but was disappointed to find the results being similar to a drug store brand product not to mention this product caused my skin to break out and become oily. Never had those issues with my skin before starting to use this. Also the product just pours out of the bottle causing you to end up wasting product every time you use it which makes you run out a lot faster than you would expect. * I have heard great things about Murad so I finally decided to treat myself to this moisturizer. I wanted to love it SO bad but my skin has BLOWN UP with acne so bad, it's starting to really get to me. I used to struggle with acne but it had gotten to be almost non-existed until I bought this. At first I thought my pregnancy hormones had caused my flare up, and it could be a contributor, but this is really the only new piece of my skincare regimen and it seems like others have had the same bad experience as me too. Will be throwing it away and buying my old moisturizer. * As always, every experience can be different but I'll tell you mine: I have very sensitive skin , dry to normal, rarely have acne besides the occasional pimple. When I started using this, my face broke out like a crunch bar. TONS of bumps and several pimples. I started a new night cream at the same time so I wasn't sure, but as soon as I stopped using this my face cleared. It was pretty instant, at the end of the day the bumps were the worst and I would wash my face and wake up to no bumps (not what happens with typical acne). If you haven't heard of acne cosmetica, google it that way you can watch out for it with this product or any others. After looking closer I realized THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS SOME COMEDOGENIC INGREDIENTS (i.e. ethylhexyl palmitate)"

My makeup application was the worst showing patchy skin. I tried so many things to help, including high-end luxurious products, but nothing worked until I tried this for weeks. I saw it changed the texture of my skin that included smoother and moisturized skin. I love it so much, I just bought a second one. The scent is also light. Nothing too crazy. This was good to my sensitive skin. Highly recommend!!!! * This product did make my skin feel feel and look amazing.  However, it also caused acne breakouts that I hadn't experienced in many years.  For that reason, I can't use this product.  I wasn't prone to breakouts so it was a bit surprising. * Smooth and penetrates well. Skin feels soft and smooth * Used 2 full bottles and feel very dry. Not the product for me. * The concentration of alcohol in this is too high. It will create the ""tightening"" effect but that's actually the denatured alcohol sucking water out of your skin. Avoid this at all costs. * I have sensitive skin so this product was not for me.  It irritates my skin."

Ive used the ceramide toner and chok chok green tea moisturizer for years. This is a good addition to the collection. I have sensitive combo skin and this didn't negatively react with it at all. I personally would need something heavier during the dryer months BUT if you're oily or are somewhere with a lot of moisture in the air, I'd recommend. It also layers well with other products. * This is something i got to help heal my barrier until the peach and lily rescue cream came in the mail. Once the p&l came i found myself still reaching for this too. You get such a high amount for the price and I love that. It's a light texture true to its name. Once applied it becomes somewhat watery and blends super easily. A litte goes a long way for this reason. It has the same scent as the toner, a fresh scent. Reminds me of the p&l matcha pudding moisturizer which i use. I prefer the matcha but this is honeslty a good cheaper, alternative. It can be used in the day time or adding a little more for night. I like using this on retinal nights to help keep my barrier from getting out of wack again. Im a peach and lily girl but i see myself still buying this as well as the toner to use alongside also. * I wanted to like this but it's nothing special. I wish it was a little more moisturizing since I found myself having to apply way more than a typical moisturizer. It also pills no matter what sunscreen I use. However I do like how much product you get and the light fragrance and texture it has. But there are way better options at the same price point that'll give you more moisture. * I have oily to combo skin and I have been using this product for a few weeks now. The cream has a nice texture (feels like a water gel), no oiliness. It's so light and refreshing!! It has a mild lemony smell to it (not artificial), I have sensitive skin but it did not cause any irritation to my face. Having said that, I dont think this will provide enough hydration for dry skin..it absorbs quickly and gives perfect hydration for my oily skin. The tub is huge and will last me more than a year! glad I tried this product and will keep buying it * Ive been looking for a new day time moisturizer for a while and was between this an the cocokind texture smoothing moisturizer. I got the cocokind one and ultimately returned it and exchanged it for this one. I should have just gotten this one first! In ONE use my redness was dramatically reduced, my dry spots were gone, and any active acne was significantly less inflamed. The value of the product along with the amount that you get for the price is out of this world. It's comparable to the Laneige Water Cream (which is what I use at night) (I actualky think this is better than Laneige…) and only a fraction of fhe price! If you're considering this, just go for it! * I picked this up for spring and summer and I'm in love. I have combo skin woth an oily t-zone and this is absolutely perfect for my skin. I love Korean skincare and I can't get over the amount you get for less than $20 * I've tried all the fancy overpriced moisturizers and this one beats them all. Also, a lot of the more expensive moisturizers have toxic chemicals and this one is CLEAN. This product is v moisturizing for my v dry skin and I decided to try it on my v dry lips as well and it almost completely cleared the chapped areas. Will be buying this product for a long time, but won't even need to do that often bc the larger bottle is huge."

I wish it wasn't so expensive, but it makes my skin look flawless. * Forever and always I loved Charlotte Tilbury's products cause her work is so classy and fabulous * I was so hoping to love this product after seeing it on social media. However, it caused my skin to break out...bummer. I believe my skin can't handle the niacinamide. I had seen mixed reviews and gave it a try. * My combo sjib drinks this up! My skin was breaking out abd dry from traveling. This was the only moisturizer that would soothe my skin without making it worse. Now that my skin has recovered it is my go-to. * I prefer this over the other magic moisturizer from Charlotte Tillbury- this one is much more hydrating and easier to apply. * let me start off by saying yes, the price is ridiculous. but if you can afford it and would really use it, it's so worth it. sits really well under my makeup and doesn't feel too heavy or thick on my skin especially because i'm oily. makes my skin feel really soft and smooth while keeping it hydrated. the hype is real!! * Will update after i try under makeup but i purchased this on a friday and rarely wear makeup on the weekend.
The reason I purchased this was for the picture of the girl in display advertising that it diminishes redness. This seems to be making it worse x5. It has also been severly irritating my skin immensely"

Bold statement to make to someone with psoriasis. Took the offered sample and used on the back of one hand. Within 20 minutes, it was as if all the moisture had been sucked out of that area and a fresh psoriasis patch began forming. 🙃 Would probably never have purchased after the pushy salesperson, but absolutely will never purchase anything from this brand after the reaction. * This is so hydrating and refreshing on my dry skin. * Amazing product. Ive see dramatic change on oil production and pores . Love the idea it contains primer. * This product unfortunately works really well.

I workout outside everyday in FL, so finding an SPF that was water and sweat resistant was important. I have tried so many, but thankfully I found this one. I've had so many bad breakouts from SPFs that claimed to be acne safe but this one actually is. * I'm usually a mineral sunscreen girlie because they don't irritate my eyes, I avoided chemical spfs for ages because they'd sting! But this spf doesn't sting at all, infact it's very gentle on my sensitive skin. It applies smoothly, no white cast at all, and sinks in after about 30 or so minutes. It's not greasy but does leave a dewy finish. Not much scent, but there is a subtle ""sunscreeny"" smell to it. * I was looking for a travel sized set of sunblock to take on vacation in January and stumbled upon Dune.  The fact it was gel was a huge influence and I bought the set.  Its pretty amazing.  It works into the skin nicely and doesnt leave my hands super sticky afterwards like some lotions do.  We ended up using all 3–the Mug Guard (face), Bod Guard (body) and Life Guard (after burn).  I just repurchased this full size Mug Guard (this is kind of a misnomer, as its only 2.2 oz) as its the one I use the most.  As a caveat, depending on what you have on your face, it *can* leave somewhat of a white cast.  Most of the time I'm fine, but there have been occasions where, depending on what moisturizer/serums I use, it does leave a bit of white on there.  Its not enough to make me stop using it, but its good to keep in mind.  Otherwise, I love the way it absorbs and how it feels. * Initially i thought this would work for me. I lived the fact that it was clear and felt it woudl absorb quickly too. However, having a recent health issue, i was disappointed to find Chemical UV Filters listed in the ingredients. My Dr. mentioned these filters mimic estrogen and can wreak havic with your endocrine system. So unfortunately I cannot risk using this lotion. * I was so pleasantly surprised by this sunscreen. I have extremely sensitive skin, acne, rosacea, eczema, you name it. Finding a sunscreen that doesnt cause a reaction felt impossible but alas sunscreen is a necessity. I took a chance on this when it was on sale because of the glowing reviews truthfully not expecting much other than an overpriced basic sunscreen. I am happy to admit I was wrong. I LOVE this sunscreen. It goes on so well, never breaks my skin out with rashes or acne, and reapplies without becoming a mess. I have started using this on my kids too. I came back to order more and leave this review. The bottle is small but it spreads out very well. 10/10 RECOMMEND if your skin cant tolerate most drug store brands. * I bought the Dune Mug Guard on a whim on sale at another store. It's now my holy grail. I had seen so many instagram ads and became curious. I've been wearing it everyday for a month and am so in love with this product. I have very sensitive skin, rosacea, and psoriasis. My skin hasnt looked this good in years, let alone felt this good wearing a sunscreen. It melts in beautifully, gives a lovely glow, and is long lasting. If youre not careful and get it too close to your eye opening, you could experience some burning but that is typical of any American chemical UV filter. After my month of use I think I've only gotten it near my eye twice where it cause a tiny sting and I washed it away quickly. Not a strong enough reason to rate it poorly. I've had other friends try out this sunscreen and they love how it feels and doesn't have that sunscreen smell. * ive been searching and searching for a good spf….and here it is. ive tried it once, today actually, and got several compliment on my skin today! I have dry/sensitive skin so the fact that i didnt have trouble introducing this into my skin care routine nor any breakouts is everything 🤌🏽🤌🏽"

Love it * My skin feels smooth and moistureized. * This is my night cream ever night.  It works, It does not irritate my skin. What's not to love about that? * I received a sample of this and did wear sunscreen during the day. The first night it went on everything seemed fine. It went on with no problem. The second day I felt a little tight itching? By the third day I started seeing peeling around my nose and my face felt itchy and burny. Not an overwhelming itch but enough to recognize I'm having a bad reaction. Peeling, itching and a slight burning sensation. I didn't use makeup the first two days but when I put makeup on the third day, it went on blotchy and I could see the irritation on my cheeks, mostly below my eye area.

I would cry if FAB ever discontinued this product. 1000% would recommend. * This is a great moisturizer super lightweight better for like oily or skin types. But I like it as a quick little water cream to add to whatever else I'm using for the day. Smells delicious and love coconut so for me, this is a must have! * This product is amazing, it's so light weight and smells amazing. Would definitely recommend * i really loved the product and how it made my skin feel but i went thru the whole thing in one month!!! i can't be buying this every month for that price :/ * If you have acne or just skin in general you NEED this is in your life! * I wanted to love this. The texture is great- very lightweight, dries nicely, and no stickiness, heaviness, dryness, or tightness on my skin after use! Unfortunately, on application, my skin immediately started stinging. I have some rosacea on my cheeks, and this moisturizer made it look and feel awful. The stinging stopped fairly quickly, but the redness persisted. I initially thought it could be from the combination of layering products, but I applied the moisturizer to a clean face with no other product, and it still stung and increased my redness. I have not had this issue with other FAB products- usually they play nicely with my skin type and other products in my routine- so I was very disappointed. If your skin is less sensitive, it might work well for you (again- great texture!), but given that FAB are the ""sensitive skin specialists,"" I have a hard time recommending it."

Love that it uses truly clean ingredients. Texture and smell are great, I have no notes. Can be used any time of year! * The reviews fooled me again. I thought this was a lightweight moisturizer. It felt very heavy and greasy on my skin. I will be switching back to the blue Neutrogena moisture and try this out again during the cold and dry months! * Absolutely in love with this moisturizer! This has been the holy grail in helping my sensitive and irritated skin get back on track. I love the feel and the way it sits on the skin after application. I use it only in the evenings for the perfect hydration pick me up. * It goes on well over serums and under sunscreen and makeup. It's the only moisturizer that stays on my face at night abd doesn't transfer to my pillow. Great for night and day. Works for my combo skin. * This is my dream moisturizer as someone with dry-combo skin with large pores. I've always loved the lightweight and bouncy feel of a gel cream, but never got any lasting moisturizing properties. Richer moisturizers did the job, but were both heavy feeling and we're not as satisfying of an application experience (I recognize the latter is totally personal preference, so they wouldn't lose points for that alone). THIS MOISTURIZER, THOUGH? Heaven, nectar, everything I want in a moisturizer including price point. On my days I laze around the house and don't go into the sun, I will wear this without sunscreen and my skin stays moisturized through the entire day. I have bought this over and over again and haven't returned to Korean moisturizers which were my original preference due to the relative affordability and accessibility. BUY THIS OMG"

Love that it isnt too heavy on my combo/acne prone skin * I was hoping this product would work well on my acne-prone skin, but it doesn't seem to do much for me. It doesn't absorb very well into the skin so the more you use the more ends up sitting on your face. The claims about this moisturizer being pre-biotic don't seem to mean much.

I just alternate between a lot. * Ive been trying to find something for my oily acne prone skin. I used the peach and lilly. I was okay, but it wasn't moisturizing enough.

Highly recommend! * I've gone through a couple jars of this moisturizer - it's incredibly rare to find one that truly doesn't clog my pores, and despite some highly comedogenic ingredients, this one surprisingly does not break me out at all. Also makes my skin incredibly soft. Unfortunately, however, as I continued to use this, noticed my pores becoming increasingly large and more noticeable, and my skin texture getting worse and worse.

No breakouts and i love it! * So ive used almost the entire jar because hey it was an investment. The texture is similar to Neutrogena water cream, and acts the same. I bought this cream for its ingredients because i love anything with sea weed or algae. Its an ok cream for eveyday if you live in a mild climate, not for extreme weather. But upon applying to the face it smells so bad and that's saying a lot from because i lost my smell from covid. I can only imagine what others smell….. i wore this cream for a 14 hour work day outside in freezing weather and it did not protect or last very long. 
On s nomal day in more mild climate its ok. You only need a little bit otherwise it sits on the face snd takes time to absorb, on hot day you'll start sweating whike it absorbs , not cool. 
Overall I would not repurchase or recommend this product. I love Osea body products and the facial serum but this is a pass for me. Ill finish the jar for sure because im not going towaste, but will be adding face oil to protect in cold weather. * This product literally burns my face, my face will get really red and hot to the touch.

The murad sunscreen in a blue bottle is about the same size and the same price but works amazing. * I switched to this sunscreen and my pores and oily skin were controlled also my skin felt amazing! I could t rebuy it because I was pregnant but whenever I get my hands on this again I would gladly stick to this only. The only con is the size and price * I wanted this to work for me but it kept making me break out after a week of use. Every day I had new pimples showing up. Other than that, I like everything else about it. It absorbs well and is easy to apply. It doesn't leave a white cast or smell like sunscreen. My face felt moisturized throughout the day and the SPF is good. Just wish it didn't cause acne! * This is the first product with sunscreen that doesn't break out my sensitive skin. Really like how is makes my skin glow after application. My makeup application is great not cakey and doesn't move around my foundation or concealer. * I have super oily skin so finding a daily moisturizer has been a struggle. This was recommended at the store and I'm SO in love with it! The texture is perfect and it keeps me matte throughout the day. And the SPF is a huge bonus!"

Recently I bought a $150 moisturizer claiming it was magic, when THIS..PUR Cloud Cream (for a fraction of the price)..was all I've ever wanted and needed. It is the silkiest product and it just melts into the skin like a drink for your pores. I mix it with a dab of Charlotte Tilbury ""beautiful skin"" foundation and I feel like a million bucks. Immediate confidence boost. It's just enough tint to perfect the redness from my acne and scars...and it leaves the most gorgeous finish, like I just got back from the medspa and my skin is plump, hydrated, and GLOWING. I got this as a sample from Ulta and I had to come back here, buy the full size immediately, and leave a review. I knew nothing about it so when I searched it up I was expecting this to be much more expensive. A double win for it's attainable price!! Please never discontinue. * I am allergic to tocopherol acetate, and this is the only moisturizer I can find at Ulta without it. Thank goodness it works well. Feels nice, not greasy. Absorbs quickly, and isnt strong smelling. * This is one of the only things I can use on my face! I dont have to worry about my face sweating when
I wear it. It is lightweight and is scent free! * Okay so. I have extremely finicky, super sensitiveGr, combination skin. Ive tried lots of moisturizer brands such as Clarins, CosRx, Drunk Elephant, and Beauty Counter. As great as they worked, my skin sucked up the creams too fast and didnt last me throughout the whole day. Serums helped, but would cause me to break out in consistent trouble spots. The way it sat on my skin did NOT feel even. Rough versus smooth. And when using foundation, you could see the different textures. 

Since using Pür Cloud Cream, I can honestly say this is one of the most amazing products Ive ever tried?? 
When applying, a little is a lot. It smoothes out so evenly, feels cold and refreshing right off the bat. I let it sit about a minute or two, did a test feel of my skin. Let me tell you, the texture was IMMEDIATELY consistent over my whole face. Trouble areas such as the nose, above my lips, smile lines, and eyebrows were rich and hydrated. Im actually kind of shook how quickly, too.

When using foundation, it gave an airbrushed feel and look. My skin still felt smooth! And was definitely still hydrated. 

So excited for trying this product. Will DEFINITELY buy it again. * Lightweight and goes on smooth * Love this for my acne prone skin, it soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated. Not oily and clogged at all like some moisturizers. * All of the PUR products have been really nice for my dry, sensitive skin. These have become holy grail products for me over the last year."

Great product! * Truly oil free. I have oily skin so I can immediately pick up on oily products. Very light weight and good texture. Best I've used so far. * Great product * I had started using the Bareminerals Skin Longevity line but didn't quite care for the daily moisturizer with sunscreen so I bought this product.  I am 60 yoa and have struggled with acne and skin problems since I was a teenager.  I believe it's mostly due to bad genes because my sisters and daughter also had acne problems. This moisturizer absorbs well, but because it is oil free, it doesn't leave my skin shiny or greasy looking. It makes my skin feel fresh and smooth. I do not look my age and I believe that using these Baremineral products contribute to my better looking skin. * I use this daily after cleansing. It is light-weight but easily covers my face & neck. It isn't oily at all. I have used other products in the past. They cause breakouts and leave my face feeling greasy all day or soak in immediately & don't create a good foundation. * Best moisture I have ever used. A little goes a long ways.  My skin has never felt or looked this good. Absolutely love this product.  Please don't ever stop selling this."

I noticed how smooth, how easy to smile it was, and what a big difference it was from the previous years. Using the whole set it's very expensive but if you are careful and use them as indicated they last.  I bought mine on October 2022 and run out of them in February 2023 bravo!!!  And that was because I had to travel to different countries so I ended taking small amounts in my containers when I when to Europe. Then on my way back I travel to Mexico so I took all the bottles because I was going to stay there 3 months. Then my set got finished there   I checked in the fine stores in Mexico but there were no Refills so I had to I'm wait till I return to USA to buy them. I'm strongly recommending the Lancôme Absolute products they all wonderful! Use them carefully and daily! * I love this product, and I've tried quite a few high end moisturizers. I'm 52 a post menopausal. I only gave it 4* because of the price, and the fragrance.  Most over the age of 50 will likely remember a bottle of White Shoulders sitting on their grandmother or mother's vanity, and that's what the smell of this cream reminds me of. Very floral and not just roses. I can live with the price, but I would definitely give it 5* if Lancôme would make a fragrance free version. The fragrance doesn't linger, but the smell reminds me of what old women smelled like when I was a child."

I will be adding this to my daily routine. * I got this in a sample when it first launched and fell in love! however since I've gone through almost an entire full size jar, its just not hydrating enough for my skin even though I am very oily! I have acne prone skin and am super picky with ingredients so I had super high hopes, but it sadly fell flat. on goes my search for my favorite all day & night moisturizer 🥲 * This made my skin soft and smooth! Felt like my pores were minimized and skin hydrated! I needed something Hydrating for winter that dried my skin out but not overly heavy or greasy * Caused small red bump breakout using with the essense lotion so i would recommend using this alone after face wash. Absolutely love the feel and smell of this. Face never felt so soft. * i went into ulta wanting to buy the first aid beauty moisturizer but it was sold out. one of the employee's recommended this one to me and i figured id give it a try since neutrogena discountinued my normal moisturizer and i needed to find a replacement. its been like 2 weeks and im honestly not that impressed by it. for the price, i was expecting more but i still woke up dry a couple nights and my face doesnt feel as hydrated as i would like. it didnt break me out though and it doesnt make my skin oily so those are some good things about it. * Omg the design, so nice. Pink with a shiny white lid, looks imperical. And the box it came with, bright red inside. You just want to open it and use it right away. I used it as a mask, love love love. Skin felt nourished and smooth. Need to buy a full size * I got this as a sample size in my last purchase and now i have a new favorite moisturizer. This stuff is so smooth and makes my face feel so soft. Plus, i have sensitive skin and this doesnt make my face itch or burn at all. My face feels mosturized and glowing."

It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy! * I can't believe it took me so long to find this amazing product. I will have it a part of my skin routine forever now! Such a great lotion for my whole body. Highly recommend purchasing if you have dry and sensitive skin. Game changing product so excited I found it! * As someone with dry and flaky skin, I've tried countless lotions over the years, but none have worked as effectively as this one.

This is like a light watery lotion but absorbs like a rich cream. It soaks right in and paces a velvety, supple feeling that I love. Sometimes my skin is drier so I could see me being able to use this during the day also without being too heavy. It does have a scent. It's like candy strawberry and flowers. It's light and goes away very shortly. You only need a little of this because it spreads so well. It can be easy to go overboard. I think this is definitely worth the money given the ingredients, packaging and how long this will last. Especially compared to other creams. I don't breakout but wake up with super soft, nourished skin. * I want to love this product so badly but the fragrance/essential oils in this caused my eczema to flare up.

If i dont shake it i can see the oil. * I bought this sunscreen on accident because I thought it was a free gift and didn't check until I picked it up in store. However, I decided to use it because I needed a new sunscreen and surprisingly, this worked very well for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it sits on top of my other skin care products very well. This is also the first sunscreen that hasn't irritated my skin or burned my eyes which I truly appreciate because every sunscreen I've worn in the past had an extremely painful reaction on my eyes. I plan on repurchasing. * I use this product for daily use. It is lightweight and keeps your face clear and oil free. * i'm so glad i found this sunscreen! beginning with the biggest pros for me- i've seen no new breakouts, doesn't pill, and feels like nothing on my skin. i really hate when i can feel an spf on my face but with this product my skin feels light and clean. pilling and clinging to dry patches is very annoying and i've noticed ZERO pilling/exaggerating of dry patches. 

the few cons i have are very nitpicky- fairly strong smell and isn't mattifying. the smell is almost floral but mostly is just a normal sunscreen smell, which isnt a huge deal to me but might be too much for those sensitive to fragrance. i also wouldn't consider this a mattifying products which i actually prefer. theres little to no added shine but again, not very mattifying.

overall i'm so glad i finally found an spf that works on my skin! * Considering I have very oily skin, this didnt moisturize my skin at all. I had to use it as a straight up sunscreen over my regular moisturizer which defeated the purpose for me. It was defined mattifying to the point of drying. * I do my best to avoid sun exposure to my face, so I am always applying sunscreen. This works really well, it's not runny like some other suncreens for your face and I like the way it smells. I feel that it works really well and don't notice any redness or irritation eithet! * I didnt like this at all! It leaves my skin so oily. It also feels very heavy. The only pro about this is there is no white cast."

Ive also found that it makes me skin almost feel ""sore"". Like when i touch my skin it kind of just hurts. Ill definitely be going for a different toner. * Using as directed, this causes significant irritation after a couple applications. I've been able to avoid the irritation by applying it with a cotton pad once a day after cleansing, but, after regular use over a few weeks, I can say definitively that this is causing breakouts where I don't notmally get them. It's such a shame because it really does give my skin a lovely, healthy glow. * This toner has quickly become one of my skincare staples, and as soon as I stop using it I notice a huge difference in my skin not looking as hydrated and glowy. Since using this, I get so many compliments on the natural glow of my skin (and it was the only product I changed in ny routine). 

I am begging BEGGING, that this is released in a larger product size soon * I just love this toner. I have bought it multiple times and will continue to.

I've been using this moisturizer for years! I always get compliments on my skin, it's been my go to forever. I even mix a little of it into my foundation the past few years when i want a more sheer coverage. 

They changed the formula and this one is not a winner. It instantly pills. Doesn't absorb. Right after putting it on, my face feels dry. I am so so disappointed and on the hunt for a new moisturizer. * I love this whole positively radiant line from the cleanser to the gel moisturizer it's all very good and didn't irritate my very sensitive skin which the oat line meant for sensitive skin, did. this is my favorite stuff. * NOT a fan of the new formula. It smells like tart green apple candy and feels greasier/sitting on top of my skin. I'm also annoyed they are branding this like it's the same old formula just in updated packaging when it is definitely not the same product anymore. I compared them directly and the percentages of ingredients are different, and the new product is a lower weight. I wish they acknowledged/provided reasoning for the changes, otherwise I have to assume it's now a lower quality product and a victim of shrinkflation.

It does not pill on me and i have never had an issue with the pump (I always get the larger size). Occasionally it will sting my eyes if I'm outside a lot in the summer, but i find that to be the case with most SPF. * Just as it says Water Drench. Moisture all day.

You can also get this product in their acne clearing kit, along with a foaming face wash and spot treatment. Love it! * Got this moisturizer as a wake me up for the cooling effect, but the amount of product doesnt even cross the verticle E in ""clear"" written on the front of the bottle. Highly disappointed because had i noticed before using it, I would have returned it. * As someone that's been struggling with finding a good moisturizer for my oily skin I am very impressed I struggle with oily skin so bad and it his moisturizer doesn't leave a shine and controls the oil :) * The only thing I really dislike is the scent I cannot figure out what it smells like (I've read the ingredients it's a lot of flowers) but I hate it. Other than the scent it's really helped my skin, I have oily/combo, it absorbs really fast, a tiny amount goes a long ways! * I just want to start by saying, I've never had a moisturizer that has ""wowed"" me before. This still isn't that, but it's the closet I've got. My initial response was, ""this is really silky!""—and it is! It is a bit tacky while drying, but nothing horrible. Now the scent is a bit on the strong side. I normally am okay with floral scents, but this one is a little too much. Nothing that would make me wash it off, but I don't prefer it. The reason it's great for my very oily, acne-prone skin is that it doesn't leave me with that gross, greasy effect I get after using most cream moisturizers. However, if you have dry, acne-prone skin, I do not recommend this gel moisturizer. (Check out Tatcha's 'The Dewy Skin Cream' moisturizer—that one works great for my skin when it gets dry in the winter.) I am greatly appreciative for this moisturizer this summer, hopefully it continues pairing well with my CeraVe products, so I can continue using it! * This is a wonderful light moisturizer. It doesn't make your skin feel oily or greasy, I noticeably don't have odors or residues that make me love this stuff, and more on this winter, gifted by dermalogica * I received this moisturizer complimentary from Dermalogica (ULTA Team). It has fragrance in it so it might not be suitable for sensitive skin. I love the texture of the gel, but I did not notice any cooling effect on my first application. I put the gel in the fridge the next day and it felt much better on my skin.  It is very light-weight and it did not leave my skin sticky. I use multiple serums, toner, and other facial products so I appreciate how I can layer them all without feeling heavy."

I would also add that it has a very oily finish, so if you have oily or combo skin, this likely isn't for you. * I've used this through a couple of bottles. My skin takes time to adjust to products (hence why the couple of bottles). 

I love that it is cruelty free and has vegan collagen. I love that it has SPF 30, a must for me, BUT it smells like sunscreen. It is definitely moisturizing, I don't have an issue with dry skin, BUT it's rather greasy. My daughter has even commented that my face is really greasy when I wear it (not really the vibe I'm going for). The chemicals burn my eyes as the day goes on. If I even wipe my eyes, it takes me minutes to wipe away whatever traces of this moisturizer is around my eyes. If I regularly wore makeup, this would be extra problematic. If you wear contacts, I do not recommend this. Imagine that burning getting caught up under your contacts.

I really, really wanted to love this because I didn't want to go through having my skin adjust to a new product, but I can't justify it based on it being a habit. * As mentioned by others, this would be more accurately described as ""SPF 30 sunscreen with collagen."" Smells exactly like a normal drugstore sunscreen. It's light and doesn't feel too greasy (but there is still a bit of that feeling). Overall it's ok * Just finished my bottle and ordered another one.  I have sensitive, adult cystic acne, 44 yr old skin that is in the normal to dry stage. This product:
1) has a sunscreen like feel to it when you first apply it, then it fades away
2) has a great glass bottle that you can get ALL of the product out of!
3) Spreads well- at little goes a long way- to much will make it sticky and it won't dry down fast
4) plays well with Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid serum and PUR love your selfie foundation. * I'm getting older, and my skin is changing, and I hate it. My old favorite daily moisturizer/SPF by No. 7 started making me breakout after years of no problems, so I had to search for something new. All the others I tried that claimed to not clog pores also happened to be too drying for my slightly oily but aging but still acne prone and also kinda dehydrated skin (ugh). But the moisture level of this Goldilocks cream is just right. If you have dry or slightly dry skin you will probably like it, if you are 40+ you will probably like it, if you're young and have oily skin you might NOT like it because it is not a light liquid, it's definitely a thick-ish cream. I can tell the fragrance they were trying for was *floral* but it leans more chemical, although it disappears in a minute or two. After application the skin feels moist, but not greasy. Makeup applies perfectly over it with no pilling at all. I somehow manage to not look shiny over the course of the day, which is practically miraculous. It doesn't seem to make me break out, as I've been using it for several weeks with no notable flares. I am relieved to have found my new favorite! * i like how this spf does not leave a white cast like other spfs. Plumped my skin right up and gave it a nice silky glow. * Love the fact its a moisturizer and has spf. Its easy to use and dont need as much since it spreads easily on your skin. I can feel it last for a good amount of time too"

It does nothing for my skin… super greasy, no firming, and makes my skin look worse. For the price I expected at least a decent product. In my opinion there are SO many great moisturizers out there that out perform this and are cheaper. * Bought this because I like the day cream version a lot.  This however was just not a great formulation for me.  It simply NEVER absorbs into my skin and then it just rubs off on my pillow case or hands eventually.   And I don't use an excessive amount because of the price tag.  I'm a big fan of using the minimal amount required.  It's too late to return it, so it's just going to move into my graveyard of products that I can't bare to throw away because, $$$, but just don't work on my skin.  Le sigh.  But, I still love the extra firming day cream and all my other Clarins products.  I would recommend trying a sample of this before buying if possible so you know if it's a good consistency for your skin. * Excellent result 👍 * Light weight, non greasy.  Plant enriched.  Vegan.  Long lasting.  Eco friendly packaging. * Really recommend this line for girls after 50. I feel my face firming after second week and continue improving. * This product is amazing!"

It also went bad pretty quickly and started to smell like pungent onions (no smell initially). * Great intro to retinol. I have sensitive, acne prone, oily skin. This did not irritate my skin, and honestly it has improved my acne. My skin has never looked better with Cosrx and i've been struggling with my skin since middle school. I am now 26. * This stuff is GOLD. I had never used retinol and read that a small percentage is the best way to start and wow. Every night I put this on my skin is instantly dewy, glowy, and looks so fresh. It's been a game changer in my skin care routine"

Its The Only Toner I Go Back To Because In Its First Use You Can See The Dirt That Is Removed From Your Face & In Every Use. You Can Visually & Physically Feel/Tell The Difference When Using This Product. I Like To Add Some Into A Spray Bottle & Then Remove Excess With A Cotton Pad. This Also Helped Me Years Back When I Was Having A Long Going Acne Breakout. I Have Not Had Any Problems With This Product & Will Continue Using. * I did not find this product to be soothing. Instead of reducing redness it seemed to make my skin more red. It left my skin feeling sticky instead of moisturized. My skin is a little sensitive, but i dont usually have to stop using products without finishing them. * I have mild rosacea. I am not consistent in my skincare routine, I will get some surface acne.   I implemented it into my current routine and used it consistently for 3 months. After about 6 weeks, I tried some variations to ensure that there wasn't interaction with what I was using. It did not exacerbate redness or irritate; however it also, did nothing else. The earthy smell dissipates as it dries. Nothing changed  I would not waste my money in the future on this particular product. * I have rosacea and this product helps to soothe redness and prevent further reactivity. It feels good on the skin and smells great. * Its so expensive, i wish it wasnt worth it. But it is! This makes my dry, sensitive skin so smooth and hydrated. 10/10. * I hope this product works for a lot of people. I have been searching for some thing that would help calm my angry skin. This has worked very nicely so far I've use this after I shaved my face, and it worked better than Proraso after shave.  I know everybody's skin is different so it may not work for you but coming from someone who has tried a lot of products. This is the one that has finally worked for me. I'm excited to try the moisturizer next. * I can't handle the odor of the Mega-Mushroom Relief and Relience Lotion.  May need to look gif a product from a different company."

Absolutely not worth the price point. There are more hydrating options out there. * I have dry, sensitive skin & this cream has been a game changer for my skin. I love that this balm doesn't have shea butter like most balms because i suffer from acne & cannot use that ingredient on skin. This cream has cleared my acne (i assume because it has salicylic acid) & my skin just looks & feels so much healthier. I love it so much, but like someone else said in the comments…I wish they made a bigger size because i go through this stuff so quick since i use it day & night. * I have extremely dry skin. It's very sensitve and reactive due to an autoimmune disease. I can use hardly anything on my face. I use and like the Kiehl's cica but thought this would be better with the colder temps now. It's not. Skin is dryer and I can tell my skin barrier is unhappy now. It reminds me of using body lotion on your face (which I've tried a few times) it leaves a chalky matte finish too. Not good for my middle aged skin. 
Their Cica cream is far superior and so is anything by Ursa Major for all you out there with unhappy dry skin. This doesnt cut it as a facial lotion. * This is vry healing on my dry skin. It gave me a couple of whiteheads on my face, but I noticed that it really calmed the redness. It's a trade-off. I would rather cover a pimple with a little makeup rather than cover up the redness all over my face. * It's fine. It didnt do much for my chronically dry skin. My face actually looked a little worse the next day. However, my neck and upper chest were improved after one use. It's now my neck/chest cream and i'll stick to an oil on my face. * I received this as a free gift with purchases of other products and fell in LOVE. I have super dry, sensitive, and itchy skin. Texture is also a big thing for me. I cannot do the oily and thick feel. I'm the same with body lotion, if it is too oily, or I can feel it on my face, ICK! This was perfect. Perfect coverage, light 'non-scented' smell was great. You know how some products advertise the non-scented and it smells awful?? Not this. I can't explain it. I am going to bite the bullet and purchase a full size; it looks kind of small for the price, but I am willing to pay if it helps me get some relief! * I have rosacea and very sensitive skin. Nothing has ever made my skin feel as calm and hydrated as this product. Not even prescription products from the dermatologist. The downside is that I have to apply THREE thick coats for my skin to not feel kinda tight. Its like my skin  just drinks this stuff up like crazy! I end up going through a tube in just less than a month, which is gonna get kinda pricy, but my skin is feeling better for it."

I've not only purchased the entire live for myself but family members and it's worth every penny. A LITTLE goes a long way! * The best face cream I have ever used. * This face cream was so expensive and I felt it didn't work for me. It made my face very sensitive and my foundation didn't stay well on top it. I was disappointed but will try something new. * I am loving the results of these products. * I've tried MANY MANY moisturizers. this one is THE BEST hands down! Use it day 1 and your face feels like a babys butt the very next day. That's how fast and amazing this stuff works. Nothing will make your skins feel this soft and supple. And no breakouts! (a few moisturizers make me break out for some reason but not this) The only downside is the price; it's horrendously expensive so I hafta wait until my bday & xmas gift cards and rewards points to buy it so I only buy it about once a year. A little goes along way so I can make it last a few months. I'm 56 with normal to dry skin. * I have used it for a week now. Like the way my skin feels I use it at night. Packaging is a little over the top. Contents is a lot smaller than it appears from the outside.

My tinted serum lays flawlessly on my skin and doesnt get shiny throughout the day. Never going back to any other moisturizer. * Its not greasy, its a moisturizer. A little goes a long way. It does not clog my pores. I cleanse, tone, serum and then use this product to moisturize. It even recommends to use after using vitamin C and I hope you follow up with sunscreen. Smells like shea butter. * Just what I needed. Very moisturizing. My face use to dry out a lot. But this cream has fixed that. * Very moisturizing * Way too thick, oily  and smelled strangely.

It feels so noce on thw skin ita a gel like texture so it feels lightweight. Makes my skin so soft, the tingling takes time to get use to but it's amazing! * Fantastic product. 
I keep it in the fridge, feels simply amazing when you put it on, especially in the morning around the eyes. 
will ABSOLUTELY buy again. * I bought this on a whim ans was pleasantly suprised with how it worked. The cooling sensation was quite nice and makeup applied over it just fine. Im looking forward to using this in the summer * Freezer is a cooling gel cream that can be used as a primer and/or just a moisturizer that makes skin look smoother.  It has a cooling sensation, though not overdone, that makes you and your skin feel refreshed and revived.  It absorbs nicely into the skin, not too greasy, with a lightweight feeling.  I'm older and tried some Freezie on my hands, as well -- and love it!  It smooths out little wrinkles on my hands and fingers, making them look more youthful, kind of like a nourishing hand mask for your hands.  I'm keeping some jars of Freezie on hand from now on! * feels more of a primer then a moisturizer, it DEFINITELY feels cooling. A little too cold for my personal preference. I foud it more usefull for priming before makeup! I LOVED the way my makeup looked with it! completly blurless!"

I do like it, I can feel how it seems to be tightening my skin.. But, i havent noticed any difference. I have noticed at the very top where my hair line is, it gets super dry. I am not sure if it is the moisturizer or what but i have tried several different shampoos and conditioners and still have the problem. But i havent tried a different moisturizer yet. The smell does not bother me, it does smell good. I do feel like it isn't as moisturizing as it should be though… I really wish I could find the old Chanel Hydra Micro Creme! 

Honestly, I believe this moisturizer just depends on your skin type. I use it with my Chanel foundation.. I am still iffy about it because I feel like it also shows my ""fine lines"" more but I am not very good with all of this anyway. Lol * I unfortunately have sensitive skin, I find the fragrance to be irritating on me. Plus I have a bit of a break out coming in from hormones. I've been trying it for a while, I really wanted to love it. * Best product ever. * The No 1 Chanel line is phenomenal. I have 3 products now and will continue to add more. This is just what my ""mature"" skin needed. 
Thank you Katarina…Chanel and Ulta are lucky to have such a professional, knowledgeable and kind associate! * I got this as a sample and I immediately bought it once it ran out. I live in the desert so my skin gets really dry with the weather here, this moisturizer has been the only thing that's been able to hydrate my skin without leaving it greasy and my pores look like they're getting smaller. I'm pretty selective when it comes to spending money but this was well worth it. * I tried this in the store on the back of my hand and could instantly visibly see a difference in my skin texture. I am NOT a $115.00 facial cream buying type of woman but the next month I just had to have it and never felt a bit of guilt on this splurge. * Not sure if I'll repurchase because the price tag on this is not really sustainable. With that being said, this is an excellent moisturizer. I think it's a little too thick to wear under liquid foundation but I'll definitely wear for night cream."

I REALLY like this product! * I am approaching forty and did not wear sunscreen daily when I was younger. This has dramatically improved my dark spots and smell amazing.

This lotion promises a lot—gentle exfoliation, brightening effects, and hydration—all while being safe for sensitive and acne-prone skin. 

By the end of the week, my skin looked more even-toned, and some of my dark spots had started to fade. The gentle exfoliation from the lactic acid helped in renewing my skin without causing any irritation or redness—a common issue I face with more aggressive exfoliants. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid exceeded my expectations! This dynamic blend of lactic acid and vitamin C not only brightens my complexion but also gently exfoliates. My skin feels smoother and looks more radiant. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula makes it ideal for use under makeup. This lotion has swiftly become one of my top choices for achieving a glowing, healthy appearance. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C is perfect for my normal to dry skin. It also brightens and evens out my skin. I love to apply it when my legs are out for a natural glow! * Looking for bright and radiant skin? Look no further! The lightweight moisturizing lotion contains 7% lactic acid for gentle exfoliation and Vitamin C for skin that will look glowy and fresh! My skin looks smoother and softer after just a few days! * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid is a staple especially for the Summer. I'm always on the hunt for some sort of vitamin c lotion. Since we have hard water that can be so tedious. Not only does it help repair my skin but I also get to brighten my skin at the same time. * I'm a big fan of the AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid AHA! This product truly brings out the radiance in my skin with its brightening formula that gives me a nice glow. I already own a few AmLactin products, but this one stands out to me because of its amazing scent – a lovely hint of cocoa that I adore. I believe this ingredient plays a part in maintaining the health and glow of my skin. I've noticed that the Vitamin C in this lotion is really working on evening out my skin tone and keeping it super smooth! * This product has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine, especially because my skin needs extra moisture when I'm constantly in the sun in the summer.

Returned it to the store. This one is not for me but Olay doesn't make it easy to know which one of their products to use. * I purchased this moisturizer from Ulta and it arrived within a few days. I use the product both morning and evening even if I am supposed to only use it once a day. My skin appears brighter and it is definitely smoother. I even use it on my neck but so far I haven't noticed a difference there. * This smooths my face and doesn't cause breakouts which so many moisturizers do. I haven't found a moisturizer yet that doesn't break me out. It lasts all day and works well underneath your makeup or by itself. I definitely plan on continuing to use this. * A couple months back I went on vacation to the Bahamas where my skin ended up breaking out very badly.  I brought this moisturizer with. It felt like my face was burning off and every time I took a shower more skin peeled off my face. It was the most miserable time ever. I assumed it had something to do with the trip. A couple days ago I tried this product again, the next morning the same thing happened, immediately this time. My face is burning, feels hot to the touch, bright red and is breaking out with little bumps all over and starting to do that gross oozy thing again. Now I realize it's this moisturizer. It might be awesome on some, just not me. I really wanted to like this product but I wouldn't wish this horrible reaction on anybody. So I guess just be cautious and if you notice something doesn't feel right, stop using it immediately. * This stuff isnt just great for your face, but can work on other sensitive areas too. I had dark marks/hyperpigmentation left behind from a medical adhesive left on my thigh too long, and this genuinely helped to fade those lines to a point where they are less noticeable * I love the way this smells. I use it in the mornings, a little hint of citrus smell is nice to give you a little wake up. Goes on a little sticky, but drys smooth and soft. Definitely recommend."

Does not irritate my sensitive skin. Calming. Definitely a favorite face cream. * I bought this and absolutely love it!! I will definitely buy it again!! * I have acne rosacea along with endometriosis, so my skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and breakouts so easily. I have tried every moisturizer from the drugstore to my dermatologist prescriptions, and nothing, I mean nothing has compared to this. this has not made my face itch, burn, or breakout. it actually took away about 90% of my redness in the first 24 hours i used it. i never thought Chanel would be my life line, but its now my holy grail. if you are truly sensitive, and not just ""sensitive"" like the majority of women say and they use like Cerave on their skin, but seriously have sensitive skin, try this out. you wont be disappointed. id rather pay more for quality ingredients than anything from a drugstore. * I have been a hardcore Charlotte Tillbury Magic Cream fan. I started using tretonin so it was suggested I use this moisturizer before and after applying the tretonin. I absolutely love it. It's extremely moisturizing and smells amazing. My face is very dry but after using this it feel so soft and smooth. It's kind of small for the price but I love it so much I will suck it up. * I wanted to love this item but I used it once and the second day, the pump stopped working.   I tried to pump many times but no product was coming out.   It was definitely a splurge but for the price it's not worth it.   Maybe change the packaging??? * I love the results of this product but I'm allergic to the fragrance. I was sneezing, runny nose, etc. Why does everyone who make such lovely lotions have to ruin it with fragrances? * My skin looks so healthy radiant and feels soft to the touch!"

But this, this one is lovely. It goes on like butter ladies. Trust me it blends well with other products too. * This cream smells like the airplane cabin bathroom pink hand soap, which is slightly offputting. It also feels thick and heavy without seeming to sufficiently moisturize my face, so I think this formula just isn't for me."

It leaves a beautiful glow and deeply hydrates but again, not for oily skin or if you leave in hot weather.Too heavy for a day cream * I got this product with high hopes. It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy. I don't like the packaging, but i've noticed a lot of brands going this route so its whatever. I would recommend it though."

It broke me out all over my face I got small little white bumps on the temples of my forehead, on my t-zone, on my chin and surrounding areas of my chin. I strongly do not reccomend. * Very lightweight but doesn't hydrate * It doesnt leave my skin feeling hydrated or plump. Its extremely light and does not feel like it penetrates the skin. * I finally found a great moisturizer for my skin type! Great for oily acne prone skin! * This is true to its name! It starts as a gel but turns very watery once applied. It soaks in nicely and its super moisturizing. It doesnt make me greasy or break me out. This moisturizer is fragrance free! I seen influencers use so much product but I seriously use one pump and thats enough. Wears well under makeup as well as the LaRochePosay spf. I highly recommend. The ingredients alone are phenomenal! * This moisturizer leaves the skin glowy and plump looking exactly as advertised! If you don't already have oily skin it may feel a little too lightweight; I have acne-prone combo skin and find myself wishing it were SLIGHTLY more hydrating however it hasn't caused any more acne or sensitivity and seems to agree with my skin. On days where I feel extra dry I've been applying a thicker moisturizer on top and I haven't noticed any pilling. * I love this moisturizer. I hate the bottle it comes in. I can appreciate some beefy, luxe-feelin' packaging as much as the next guy, but this heavy, thick glass bottle makes it a stupid hassle to use the second 50% of the product inside it. I don't need my ultra-lightweight moisturizer to come in a bottle so hefty and chunky that it would make the best choice for an improvised weapon of any product in my daily skincare routine."

I tried multiple products that left my skin feel and greasy and heavy, But this product was a lifesaver.  It's lightweight but very hydrating.  I can't wait to try the daytime, cream and face wash * I've used this product for 2 months now and haven't noticed ant differences in my skin. I was looking forward to the green tea and ceramides ingredients in it. The texture of the moisturizer is fine. Not super thick and not too thin. I have oily skin and it doesn't make me breakout or anything. Just not seeing the results I anticipated. I'd rather use the Olay's regenerist lines or Peach & Lily's matcha pudding over this where I can really see a daily difference * Usually healing my skin barrier means putting up with a week+ of slathering my face with a thick moisturizer or balm. As someone with sensory processing issues, I hateee feeling residue from those products on my skin, especially when going to sleep (iykyk)

But OMG this product is a PERFECT balance of hydrating and lightweight. It feels like my skin drinks it in and by the time I'm ready for bed there is hardly any residue! At first I worried maybe this meant it was too lightweight to a truly heal my barrier, but after a few weeks I can attest that it really does work.
The only downside is the packaging (they don't stand up) but tbh the formulation is so good, i'm still giving 5 stars. I also recommend the AM moisturizer, but idk how effective it is as SPF. Def get the night time though! * I purchased this because of the ingredients and the reviews. The product is titled ""Barrier Renew."" One of the active ingredients is oleic acid: ""Free fatty acids (FFAs), specifically monounsaturated FFAs such as oleic acid, may disrupt skin barrier and act as permeability enhancers for other compounds present in plant oils"" [36].Dec 27, 2017. That is what I found about oleic acid. I look like I sat on the sun without protection.  Disappointed and will be returning. * my skin feels absolutely amazing since using this at night. within minutes your skin feels soft, calm, supple. and the next morning I have a beautiful glow. I'm obsessed! * I had been struggling with skin that felt uncomfortably dry by the end if the day. I am glad I tried this! It is a cool, thick hydrating gel with slip that dries down to something almost imperceptible on the skin. Because it didnt leave my face shiny and greasy, I didn't expect it to work to prevent dryness- but it did! I layer it over my RX at night and under my SPF in the morning with no pilling issues. I also really like that it doesnt add MORE shinyness to my skin when laying under an already dewy SPF (another brand).  My skin doesnt look glazed or juicy with this- it just looks like normal, not dehydrated, healthy skin and thats cool with me! * This has  really good barrier repairing ingredients. It is not a heavy nor thick cream but a gel/cream in a generous size. The only issue ive had is the tiniest bit of pilling. So to counter that i mix this and a few drops of Stratia liquid gold or an oil which makes a pilling product foolproof."

It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I have just started using the RoC products. So far I have been very pleased. My skin is already looking better. I'm hoping that in time I will see a significant improvement in my skin. * Cream is a very good moisturizer. Definitely worth the money. * It's a bit pricey. Seems to be helping some lines on my face * Many other face creams/lotions I've tried leave my skin feeling like oily dirty; this one doesn't. * Haven't used it long so I don't know how it works on wrinkles yet but it does help moisturize my dry skin * It really is just a moisturizer nothing special about it. I wouldn't buy it again but it's good if you have money to spare * I've read all of these 1 star reviews and they all say the same thing...irritation, redness, chemical burn....🙄 apparently the one star people don't know what retinol is. It's a chemical. Chemicals irritate. That's the whole point! Start using it every other day or every 3rd day. Back off a bit if you see redness. Do not use too much or under your eyes. Get yourself an EYE CREAM for your EYE AREA. Once the irritation has subsided, then you can increase the frequency of application little by little until your skin can tolerate it daily. 
Here's the review part. It works as well as any retinal product does. It's a great value and is very hydrating if used correctly. I highly recommend it!"

I would recommend! * I just bought this came home put it on and instantly got a headache from the strong perfume smell. It's like they dumped a whole bottle of floral old lady perfume in this moisturizer. I looked at the ingredients and it actually says perfume and that shouldn't be in a face moisturizer. Returning this immediately * I used it for the first time a month ago … my skin is glowing    It looks firmer and I definitely will buy again * I dont know what it is about this product but even if it is the onky thing I wear that day it atill peels and clumps on my skin after it dries. Nit a fan. * The moisturizer itself works well. I like the feel of my skin while wearing it. I gave it a week but I can't wear it any more. The scent is so strong and just to much for a facial moisturizer. It smells like the sunflower perfume my Mom wore in the 90's. So to me, it just smells very dated and old. haha I gave it away. * I love this day cream!!  My face is prone to hormonal breakouts, and since using this product my skin has definitely calmed down.  I don't even wear foundation anymore (unless its an event or something), I just put this on, then put on some concealer and bronzer and I'm good to go for the day!  I love this face cream and will definitely purchase again. * Very strong fragrance smell and I think my skin started getting irritated by the product.

Great for milia!! Mine is starting to go away. * I sampled this in the store and it smelled wonderful and moisturized with being too heavy so it was perfect for my oily skin. Unfortunately, my skin reacted and I was left with a pimple and a rash on my face. * I used to use clinique and it would leave my face very dry as soon as i used FRESH it left my face moisturized the same day! I love it !! * While I wanted to love this Fresh product, I can barely say I like it. I have oily/combo skin but I feel like this product leaves me face really oily after application. I can't say if it was due to this, but I got acne shortly after I started using this product. * I have mostly oily skin with a few dry patches and this product treats both! It's hydrating but not heavy. I also wear full face makeup everyday and  this lays on my skin like a dream! Worth the price! * I've tried different products over the years and have been sticking to Estee Lauder for a long time but my skin just looked dull and tired.

Do not use for outdoor activities. It will burn your eyes SO badly. I don't have sensitive eyes or skin but I was practically blind on a summer hike. Horrible! I expect more from a brand like this. * I do have to say I only just tried this product so I'm unsure if it will break me out in the future. However it feels lovely on my skin. Before I applied this product I had some slight dry patches on my skin and it noticeably reduced the dryness. It didn't leave any white cast on my skin (I do have very fair skin though) and it made my skin looks very dewy and glowing! I would definitely recommend this product :) * I really do not understand the bad reviews. This is a great moisturizer with SPF in it. I personally like an all in one product and with 4.2 ounces you get a good value for your money. Not only does this have great ingredients, it is hydrating, sinks into your skin very easily, doesn't leave a white cast, and does not make your eyes burn. My skin glows after applying and it also wears SO well under makeup!! I do not find this sunscreen to be greasy at all. It actually makes me less oily throughout the day compared to the other SPF moisturizer I was using previously. I was using the Cerave AM lotion but wasn't in love with it as it took a lot of TLC to blend in and made my makeup pill. I was recommended this product by a friend and I am so glad I bought this. For those concerned about fragrance I notice a very very slight sunscreen smell but it doesn't bother me and I am someone who is sensitive to scents. This is a chemical sunscreen so some people may be sensitive to that. I am someone who isn't. I prefer chemical sunscreens anyway because they usually do not leave a white cast and are more hydrating. Mineral sunscreens are always too drying for my skin and leave too much of a whitecast. * I love this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I just love how it applies and how moisturized my skin feels afterwards. * It's ok. Def more of a sunscreen feel. Doesn't leave a white cast but takes a while to soak in. I have to wait quite awhile before I can begin applying my makeup. Like a lot of Kiehl's products but won't buy this one again. * I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now and I swear by it. I put it on in the morning before applying my makeup and it works perfectly. I've found that some moisturizers make my foundation look kinda wonky, but my makeup goes on top of this one nicely. Also, I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this product. I'm never going back!"

This moisturizer has never hurt my face. I use this as my night time moisturizer. In only a week i have seen great changes to my face. It feels super smooth. And dont quote me on this, but i BELIEVE this product has niacinamide in it. The niacinamide cleared my redness. I highly reccomend if you are stumped on a moisturizer for sensitive skin. * My skin is dry and that makes it quite sensitive. But this lotion and shower gel does not irritate my skin and certainly helps it feel better. * I love this i have dry skin especially in the fall and winter definitely recommend * This is one of the only lotions that does not break out my mega sensitive acne prone skin, but the niacinimide in this stings, itches, and burns for about an hour after i apply.  I wish cetaphil made a lotion without niacinimide and hyaluronic acid, as they both sting and itch on people who have mega sensitive skin.   Until they make one, this will have to do. * This is a good skin moisturizer for all skin types."

I am an extremley oily girl. And ive tried every oil controlling moisturizer our there. Nothing seems to work. So i decided to give this one a try because its cheaper than most moisturizers and comes with SPF. First complain i have is that it has a horrible scent. Its so strong as well. I dont know how to describe it but it smells so so bad. Second complain is that if your a darker skin girly do not buy!! It says it has a new sheer formula but that is a lie! Im not even that dark and this leaves me looking grey. Its also kinda hard to blend out. It dries down super quickly. For the most part it works okay. Personally i like the la roche posay matte moisturizer better but its pretty pricy. I will not be repurchasing ever again. Their PM moisturizer is amazing though! * This is a real and true review from a extremely oily skin woman. 
I have extremely oily skin with no skin issues. (Clear oily, olive skin)
I literally have bought every mattifing oil controlling sunscreen on the market including Korean brand/asian. And nothing controls the shine like this product. 
Im so happy i found this and tried it. 
I have never even tried this brand before this because i dont have skin issues. 
It is thick so alittle goes along way. The smell isnt bad and fades out after a couple minutes if your sensitive to smell. 
Over all very good sunscreen feels very light and clean. 

Thank you panoxyl! From the bottom of my heart thank you. * I do love this product and highly recommend it to those with acne prone skin, as it's great for oil control and doesn't clog pores. however, the first few times you use it, it may burn slightly, but your skin should get used to it after a few uses. it also leaves a slight white cast but if you blend it in enough you should be fine. PRO TIP: do NOT use the panoxyl PM moisturizer if you have acne prone skin. it has pore clogging ingredients! * I wear it under my makeup and ever since using it I can clearly see a huge difference. It stops my oiliness from seeping through my foundation and has even made my makeup look much better. I will definitely be buying this product again! * I love that it actually makes my skin less oily and it also makes my skin appear more smoothe. 10/10 * Its an okay sunscreen it does leave a white cast only good thing about product is that it controles my oily skin. * I was hoping for a lightweight moisturizer/sunscreen combo, this isn't it. It's more like an extremely thick suncreen than a moisturizer.  It dries insanely fast, and leaves a terrible white cast! I'm already super pale, and this made me look like a ghost. It doesn't sit nice on the skin at all. It dries streaky and applies unevenly- it literally looks like chalk. I found that it tends to pill around the edges of my face, like my jaw and hairline. I have dry skin, and this dried me out even worse. The product contained a strong fragrenced smell, in my opinion. I washed it off, becuase of all theee factors. I wont personally re-buy, or recommend."
