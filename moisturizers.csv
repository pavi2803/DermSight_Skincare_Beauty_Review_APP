0,clinique,moisture surge 100h auto-replenishing hydrator moisturizer,pimprod2021615,2576544, * It's so light and airy. Feels like I didn't even put on any moisturizer. My skin feels amazing after putting it on. * I really love the moisture surge. Softens skin. * Just a good refreshing moisturizer. * It's way too expensive tho. There's no need to gouge people. * Great everyday moisturizer never get breakouts or looks greasy works well under makeup * I bought this product one time and it was great!  I bought it a second time and it's terrible. For the price you are better off buying a cheap store brand of lotion for like $5.00. Save your money! * Love this product!  Great for my skin!
1,bubble,over night hydrating sleep mask,pimprod2035928,2600876," * Woke up with less bumps on my face and my skin felt cleaner * When applied this felt like more of a skin tightening mask. I did ""feel"" it on my face but after a few minutes it went away. I do like the way it feels on my neck though. 
I like the packaging and the amount of product for the price. * I am very sensitive and dry. This product helps my face feel plump in the morning and gives it hydration. I am on my third bottle and I have not had any irritation. * Amazing pls buy * I love this sleep mask! It is so hydrating, and makes my skin super soft the next day! I love how you don't have to wash it off too! I would definitely recommend this product! * My daughter loves her skin care routine!! * I just love it moisturizer"

3,philosophy,hope in a jar smooth-glow multi-tasking moisturizer spf 30,pimprod2037931,2605578," * This is a great cleanser that is mild and super gentle, removing makeup and keeping my face fresh. * I accidentally ordered a different kind of cleanser from the same brand not realizing that this cleanser is the #1 reason my skin had been so clean & clear. * I have absolutely no issues with the clenser itself - I've been using it for years and it works very well.

However, the pump that the 22oz has is extremely problematic and wastes A LOT of product. It just keeps spewing it out and it gets absolutely everywhere. It's easy enough to just switch out the pump, but I shouldn't have to do that for a $50+ product. * Great product * I've been using this face wash for about 12 years. I have sensitive skin and it was the only thing I could use. When I went to buy a replacement I noticed the packaging slightly different. Then when I used it my face was burning. I still had the old bottle and compared ingredients which were different. Googled if they changed the formula and they did! Why take a perfectly fine thing and ruin it. Philosophy has lost me as a long time customer. I also used renewed hope in a jar which they discontinued. All their stuff now is trash. I will be returning this bottle. I'm completely disappointed in all these companies changing products that don't need changing. * I love Purity cleanser.  It's the best cleanser I've ever used.  It leaves your face clean without drying it out.  It's also very gentle,  I've used it for more than 10 years….love all the Philosophy products I've used over the years. * Great product. Leaves skin smooth"
4,drunk elephant,protini polypeptide firming moisturizer,pimprod2028061,2588434," * Very gentle & effective on sensitive skin. Hygienic pump, easy to use, & best of all… Actually works! Thank you Drunk Elephant! I will keep buying this product. * Drunk Elephant's Protini Polypeptide Cream is a standout in the skincare world. Its lightweight yet deeply moisturizing formula is packed with peptides, amino acids, and growth factors that work to nourish and strengthen the skin. The cream absorbs quickly, leaving the skin feeling hydrated, plump, and smooth without any greasy residue. It's ideal for all skin types, including sensitive skin, and helps improve the skin's texture and elasticity over time. The clean, fragrance-free formula is a bonus for those with sensitive skin, making it a must-try for anyone looking to enhance their skincare routine. Gifted by drunk elephant * This moisturizer was gifted by Drunk Elephant and I love it! I like to apply this moisturizer in the morning and under my makeup too. This moisturizer improved my skins texture and overall dryness.  Definitely my new favorite moisturizer! * This product was kindly gifted to me by Drunk Elephant and I have been using this for over a week and I can already see a difference in my skin! I usually have dry and dull skin and I have noticed how hydrated and plump my skin looks! * Received complimentary from Drunk Elephant in exchange for honest review. Love the packaging of this moisturizer. The moisturizer itself is lightweight and sinks into the skin beautifully. My skin gets all the love it needs from this. Love! * I love this moisturizer and the packaging is so helpful for mixing serums and tanners ! I use this morning and night and have noticed a huge change in my skin. This was especially helpful during the winter when my skin was extra dry!! Gifted by drunk elephant * I feel like this cream is a game changer. I love how it makes my face soft and moisturized. The dispenser is my favorite it's easy and convenient. I was also able to pair it with my serums for an easy canvas. I love it. Gifted by dunk elephant."
5,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial cream with squalane,pimprod2002804,2540233," * Keeps my skin hydrated and glowing! Feels lightweight. I use it mornings and nights. * Love this moisturizer for the dry winters * bought this because of the raving reviews and first thought was the price for the size is insane! la Roche posay moisturizer is 10x better and bigger for the price! second thought was it feels kinda greasy feeling on my face and doesn't really absorb that well. would I buy again? absolutely not. I bought on sale for 50% off and still wouldn't do that again. * Ok… im in love with this product! Hands down the BEST moisturizer ive ever used. Its so light on your skin and goes on super smooth. Leaves my skin soo soft and moistured. I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and this isn't irritating at all. Its just so expensive ☹️ * With formula change now peeling is inevitable and is a deal breaker for me. Before this was never an issue but now seems to be. * I have combination skin so i have a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn't break me out. I received a sample size to try, loved it so much bought a full size. Yes, it pricey, but a little goes a long way. * I really enjoyed using this. It's a nice consistency, not too thick or too thin and I find a little goes a long way. I have combination oily skin and my skin really drinks this up in the winter. My face does feel oily/greasy after a few hours though, and if I have flaky patches, it doesn't do wonders or anything. Good staple to come back to if needed. The search continues!"

7,tula,24-7 weightless moisture day & night gel cream,pimprod2045112,2624255," * I actually like this product a lot. It hydrates without feeling as greasy as the OG, and my skin feels more balanced through the day. I took off one star because it has a smell I can only liken to algae? Sort of a bad, musky, salty smell. But the product is good and I recommend it if you can handle the smell for a half hour until it disspates. If you're sensitive to smells like this I could see it being a problem for you. * I bought this by accident when I was trying to buy the 24-7 day and night moistue. First thing  I noticed was the color, which made me realize I had bought the gel cream. The weightless texure is nice but the smell is absolutely awful. I will not be using this product due to the smell. * I bought this when my previous moisturizer was about to run out. This was on sale and the reviews seemed overall positive. I've used it twice and it's going in the trash. It has a nice, lightweight feel on my skin but the smell is awful. I can't tell if it's supposed to be scented or if it's the smell of just the ingredients but it smells like it's gone bad. There are so many other moisturizers out there that work well, are half the price, and don't leave you smelling like something expired. * Absolutely love this! I never put lotion on my face and just started using this product and I get so many compliments now how nice I look and young. I am almost 45 but I don't look it. * My beauty consultant, Beautifull (yes! that is her name) is the best in the business! I had so many questions when I was looking for a skin routine. I must say my skin is WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. She is located in North Texas! * I stopped buying moisture surge (and clinique in general) earlier this year, and searched for a comparable moisturizer all of 2024. Out of the 15 products I tried this year, this has been the best option by far. I honestly think this gel moisturizer is even better than Clinique's because it's fragrance free and 100% cruelty free. So many moisturizers are also too heavy for my sensitive and acne prone skin, but this is so lightweight and absorbs quickly. It's definitely worth the price, and a little goes a long way. * This is so light and so hydrating, it does not leave any sticky residue on the skin and no harsh smell. It cools the face and gives it a nice glow"
8,it cosmetics,confidence in a cream anti-aging hydrating moisturizer,pimprod2033684,2598796," * I was a long time user of thsi cream. Years! They changed the formula, completly. Its not as thick, smells, and causes your skin to burn & breakout. I have written 3 bad reviews, and all have have deleted. I emailed IT Cosmetics when inpurchsed the reformulated formula letting them know if all the problems I experienced and was gaslit with  reply that the new formula was better. I truly belive the high reviews are fake (written by IT) or paid influencers and people who never used the original formula so they dont know any better. * Got as a mini free sample. I have normal skin. This makes my skin feel hydrated. Does not sit on top of skin - soaks in. I like the scent. Kinda smells like essential oils/ paolo santo to me. No irritation and my skin still feels hydrated in the morning after putting on before bed. Would recommend/ buy full size * I am 52 years old and needed a good moisturizer for my face.  I am very pleased with this product. It is smooth and my face feels better after applied.  I would purchase again, though I will need to save up for it. lol * If you have sensitive skin, rosacea, or dermatitis PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It burned my skin and caused rashes all over my face. I almost had to go to the ER. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT! STAY AWAY! * Purchased this for my 23 year old daughter and this is the first moisturizer that doesn't irritate her highly sensitive skin. She approves. I haven't tried it myself though. It is a bit pricey though. * IT used to have a moisturizer I loved.  I didn't see it on the shelf so I bought this one instead based on the previous experience.  It's awful.  It doesn't hydrate all day and when I put it on in the morning and try to put foundation on, it's like...weird and sticky and I have a hard time blending in my foundation.  I tried 3 different foundations, so that is not the problem.  Never buying their products again. * I have been using this moisturizer for years and absolutely Love it!! 
I use to use the nighttime one as well but switched to using this morning & night because it works so well and feels so good on my skin.."

10,the ordinary,natural moisturizing factors + ha daily moisturizer,pimprod2007113,2551163," * Ive been a hunt for an affordable face moisturizers and ive tried a couple and i thought i would give this one a try since Im a fan of The Ordinary but dont get this one. It doesnt even moisturises my face, it feels like it just sits on my face and i believe it does. One night i applied it and the next morning when i rinsed my face, I felt it on my hands, which no moisturizer has ever done that before. My face feels dryer when i apply this vs. not putting anything on my face. * Always use this! * Let me preface this review by saying i like gel moisturizers. Gave this a shot, its streaky feeling, heavy and my face doesn't feel any more moisturized. * This one of my ""go to"" moisturizers. * This is my go to moisturizer and key in my daily routine. Especially in the winter. This stuff saves my face. It also preps my skin perfectly for makeup. Love this. It's pure moisture without the greasy feeling. Please keep this in your lineup Ordinary! * This is my favorite moisturizer. My skin stays hydrated all day long without my makeup looking dried out or cracked. This moisturizer leaves my skin looking smooth and has the perfect amount of glow to it with or without makeup. I would recommend this product to all my friends and continue to buy again and again. * I have sensitive skin and have been using this moisturizer for a while now. It calms and soothes irritated skin within just a few uses. I pair it with Cold Pressed Rose Hip Oil at night and with Alpha Arbutin in the morning and my skin is radiant."

It is a little oily but once you lather it well the oily feeling goes away. * Love this especially for my winter dry chapped hands this really does the trick * I have been dealing with an irritated on and off red nose. So glad my local Ulta has it in stock. I applied a thin layer over the redness and shortly after my skin improved. It also soothed a mild burning sensation. Looking forward to using it longer term now. I already use the double repair moisturizer by this brand that i love and also their face mist. I havent been letdown yet by them! Their products have done what they say. * This is the only review I've ever written but this hand cream is magic and deserves my highest and hard earned praise. It feels like a silicone gel and a little goes a long way. It takes no time to absorb and makes your hands feel like soft rose petals with TRULY ZERO greasiness or residue. 

It heals your skin barrier so beautifully. My family has dry, cracked hands, especiallly during the dry winters, and we all swear by this. Beyond your hands, I have spent years neglecting my feet. I wear sandals all summer and my heels have been disgracefully cracked for literally 5 years. I put this cream on them once a night for, I kid you not, only four nights and my feet were baby smooth. No rough callouses and the giant, years-old cracks had miraculously disappeared. It's sorcery. 

My only complaint is it doesn't come in a larger size. The smaller size is very portable and lasts a long time, making it well worth the price. I just never want to run out. * im confused cause it felt like i was rubbing thsi product into my skin for foreverrrrrrrr. i didnt really notice any difference in my skin so it wasnt for me * im confused cause it felt like i was rubbing thsi product into my skin for foreverrrrrrrr. i didnt really notice any difference in my skin so it wasnt for me"

I decided to stop using it and my face was getting better. 
I'm so sad because this is not a cheap brand and this was definitely on the pricer side. I love their stabilizing repair cream super great.

From the first use, I was completely hooked. It has the perfect consistency — not too thick, not too thin — and absorbs into the skin effortlessly without leaving any greasy residue. My face feels soft, nourished, and incredibly hydrated all day long.
What I love the most is how quickly it quenches my skin's thirst. I have combination skin, and finding a moisturizer that balances hydration without feeling heavy or clogging pores is tough, but this one does the trick.

Try it! * this is one of my favorite korean skincare products ever, i have used it for about six years now. it keeps my skin feeling fresh and hydrated, and helps prevent signs of aging. if you don't like sticky or slimy things, maybe don't order a snail mucin moisturizer? i'm confused as to why you would lol. that's the whole point! it works very effectively and mixes well with my COSRX overnight rice leave-on mask. it is pricey but a little goes a long way, and the bottle lasts a couple of months. it is not meant to be worn under makeup though, it causes pilling and patchiness. * I liked this at first. I got the travel size to try it at first and a little does go along way. I've had it for a little over 2 months now and I don't think I've made a dent in it. And just for background I'm a highschooler with dry, eczema prone skin.

But no matter what I try my skin always peels after I put it on?? I do have dry, sensitive, eczema prone skin so I do wonder if its better for oily skin. Its just not enough for my dry skin and makes my skin peel and flake no matter how many times i change my other skincare products or makeup products. It mainly peels around my forehead, chin, and nose. Other than that I don't think it did anything for my skin that would justify the price. 

I wouldn'f repurchase personally. Maybe if I had oily skin?? * This lotion and the face wash in my everyday routine must have loved this will never change * I have sensitive skin this product cleans my face does not give me any irritation or itchiness after lose my Faith feeling refreshed and smooth. I'm always skeptical on using products to wash my face because it irritates my skin, but this is amazing. * Another great COSRX product. Moisturizes well. Can use anytime of the day. Can be use alone or with other products like the COSRX peptide skin booster."

When I do not use it I can tell. I like that I can by it in different sizes, which is economical.  So good, cannot say enough about it! I recommend buying the whole series. * I'd hoped to use this as a night cream, but it didnt deliver enough hydration over night. I'm 45, with dry skin and live in a dry climate. This one felt nice upon application, but I wake up feeling tight and needing more moisturizer. * I've loved Dermologica for at least 20 years & absolutely love love love this larger size!! Lasts sooooooo long!! * So I love the Dermalogica line of skincare.  I am 45 and have combination skin.  I have tried the whole line to find my perfect skin care routine.  I use this moisturizer on nights my skin needs more TLC.  My other go-to is the skin cocoon. * I work long shifts and this keeps my face moisturized all day. This is my fall/winter go to. Or if the elements stressed my face it hydrates and moisturizes. * Love this  product.   I've been using  it for years! * This moisturizer feels so good on my skin.

I use the toleriane wash for oily skin, then the effaclar salicylic toner, then the effaclar spot treatment and finally this moisturizer. I give it a few minutes to soak in between each step to give the products a chance to do what they're intended to do and it works great! I also make sure the moisturizer is fully dry before putting makeup and have absolutely no issues at all. It doesn't leave a film for me like I've seen in some of the other reviews and to be honest with the way it soaks in so smoothly on my skin I just don't see how it's possible. Everyone's skin is different though! * I hate not wearing foundation because my skin becomes grossly oily in a few hours. But this makes my skin look non-oily and matte with little effort. My skin doesn't feel dry, either! Would highly recommend this to anyone whose skin is oily and needs the hydration. * got this to try out and I love it! I definitely see improvement in my acne. * I love how this feels * My skin has not been reacting well to my previous moisturizers.  This one has FINALLY given me the protection and feel that I've been looking for. * This product soothing for my sensitive skin on face. It also helps control acne breakouts."

So purchase if they have original * In my constant quest for skincare products that deliver real results, I recently tried the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid. This lotion claims to gently exfoliate, boost cell turnover, and provide deep hydration to uncover softer, smoother skin. Let's dive into my experience with this multi-tasking formula.

The lotion is non-greasy and lightweight, making it perfect for daily use. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and hydrated without any heavy residue. The product is fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for those with sensitive skin or a sensitivity to strong scents. The natural smell from the lactic acid salts is subtle and varies slightly depending on your skin's unique pH, but it's not overpowering or unpleasant. * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is revolutionary! It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy!"

I am extremely oily and it's more like a lotion and it leaves my skin soft and supple and it brightens my skin which is dull. * I've only been using this product for about a week and bought thr travel size to try it out, but I can tell already my skin has never felt and looked better! For about over a year I have been struggling with my face (ezcema, acene, other dry spots, discoloration) and Cerave products were my holy grail, until it wasn't, since then I have tried numerous products, spent $$$$ and nothing work. For the last 3-4months I have been using La Roche Posay face wash & face moisturizer and its been blah. I have only been using it bc i refused to try something else and spend more money. Finally, my sister suggested Dermalogica and OMG!! All this time I had been suffering. I bought the travel size to test it out bc the full size are pricey, but let me tell you, I don't care they are expensive anymore. I have already purchased the full size products and have a full regimen for my facs. Like I said, 

I've only been using the face mositurizer, face wash, the blue bottle exfoliter (twice a week), and the brightening kit (only at night) (all travel size) and my face looks & feels amazing. 

These are expensive products, but theres a spanish saying ""lo bueno cuesta"", in english ""the good things cost"" and with these products, I can agree. Also, a little bit really goes a long way. For the face wash, I only use a pea size and its really more than enough and prettu much same off all other products. * It moisturized my face so good. Unfortunately, i cant stand the bad smell…its so bad! * I am 48 and have been bouncing around forever trying to find the perfect cream for my combination skin.  A little goes a long way.  No greasy residue and moisturizes my dry spots all day long.  My skin is smooth and fine lines are completely blurred after a few weeks of use. Best cream out there for my skin. * I enjoy the smell it reminds me of baby lotion. My skin has never looked so hydrated until this product. I don't think I will ever try after moisturizer."

Does it do it better than a drugstore brand? Absolutely not.

It's just Meh * So much improvement in my face and neck.  Also the back of my hands. * This product makes my skin so soft, so supple and hydrated! Highly highly recommend. A little pricey but so worth it! * These product smells like natural skin care. I did not check the ingredients, though. It feels rich and luxurious. You do not need a lot to cover your entire face which helps with the price tag. I think it's nice & moisturizing! It pairs beautifully with the corresponding serum. * This cream is fantastic in plumping fine lines and wrinkles. Foundation goes on smooth. Skin is Hydrated all day. Great price and the jar lasts me 4-5 months. I highly recommend * I'm on my second jar of  the Magic Cream Moisturizer.  I like it! I use the oil on top.  I can't necessarily say that it has changed my skin but, I've been blessed with pretty good skin to begin with.  I do like the moisture it gives. * I love the way it works and the scent is very nice! I can't wait to try some of the other products in this line!

It would be even better if Ulta would send me a usable coupon once in a while, instead of spam coupons that do nothing except to clog up my email inbox! Please!"

I stopped using since the dermatologist recommended Cerave 2 yrs ago. i went along with it to save money. But I am convinced like in all clinical trials, it is severely biased against indigenous skin tones and POC. somehow I keep coming back to Estee Lauder specifically for the night eye cream and this particular moisturizer. 
just 2 days and my face feels nourished, blemishes are gone, skin feels tight. It is great for my brown skin. 
It is true it is a little greasy, but how much are you all using? you really need to get used to using as little as possible as it goes a long way. I like to get the travel sizes because the moisturizer will stay fresh longer, plus somehow it comes out a few dollars less. 
Everyone from friends to partner to complete strangers have complimented my youthful look, except for the 2 years off this moisturizer. This stuff takes 10 years off at least from what I can tell. Give it a shot now! * I was really disappointed in the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ Youth Power Cream Moisturizer. The perfume smell was so strong that I could not use it on my face. * I've used Estée Lauder skincare all my life.  My favorite I'd Advanced Night Repair Serum.  My second favorite is this cream.  I'm 71 and have no wrinkles  - just some sagging.   This cream smells great and it's  special ingredients tightens the skin and makes it glow.  The texture is a marvelous gel cream and it glides onto the skin.  ULTA occasionally has it at 1/2 price! * I really wanted to like this bc I LOVE Estee. But this did nothing for my skin. I even used the serum underneath. Clarins serum is what works * I love the way it goes on and how it feels on my face. It softens my skin and helps with my dry skin. * I have never used a more luxurious moisturizer. I got it as a sample and I had to run to buy the full size. It makes me look so youthful and my fine lines are GONE! I notice a massive difference in my appearance when I use this(only at night). I also use the advanced night repair serum which pairs well together. I have very sensitive combo skin. I'm super dry during the winter and oily diring the summer. Adding this to my skincare routine has completely transformed my skin. BUY IT! You will not regret it at all.

As soon as I ran out I bought more ! Would love to try other products definitely recommend as a person with sensitive and super dry skin. * This product helped me realize my skin is sensitive to niacinimides. I was using this moisturizer day and night and noticed that my cheeks broke out in tiny bumps. BYOMA's products have so many extra retinoids, niacinimides, etc. that are too harsh for my sensitive, non-acne-prone skin. I love how cute their products are, but I need something more gentle. * This is a great moisturizer for sensitive and combination skin. Ive never had any issues with this moisturizer and I always wake up with soft skin. * I reduced my rating by a full star because the smell is just awful. It isn't a fragrance. It's an ingredient. I've worn Skinceuticals CE Feurulic which smells like hot dogs at first so I thought this would be fine. Twenty minutes later in my car... Why do I still smell it? After school drop off, makeup on, picked up my coffee, got to work....it still smells. Whyyy?

It's a really light formula, feels very nice, my skin is really hydrated. It played well under my makeup. But good gods, the smell lingers. Maybe if I followed it with a most but that would require more money spent on more products. I'll try it a little longer but this won't be a holy grail for me, unfortunately. * I love this moisturizer so much! def one of the best thag ive used. it makes my skin so soft and makes my makeup base phenomenal! only downside is that it ran out a little quickly, but that might be user error * I have typically dry skin so I prefer really hydrating products. This one was lack luster for me and I had to add other products to feel like I was actually hydrated. I think it may also leave my skin tacky which isn't a big deal but did not love that either. It lays well enough under makeup but would not repurchase. * its really lighweight and feels reall hydrating on my sensitive skin and has helped with my acne and dull skin"

My sensitive skin is ok now * I was very skeptical about buying this product because I kept seeing reviews about how the product inside was seperated and sure enough mine was as well. I saw another reviewer say they fixed the issue and I followed what they did. I massaged the tube for about 5 minutes and soaked it in a bowl of warm water for 3 minutes after you MUST shake the tube vigorously until you stop hearing the water in the tube and it'll be good to go!   It is very hydrating and calms my skin when itchy or dry. * I have very dry mature skin.  My skin needs a lot of hydration.  I also have flaking after using retinol.  I apply this to my skin at night to seal in my other products.   I also put a small amount under my eyes.  I have had no irritation.  You do have to shake the tube and massage it to get the product to to absorb the liquid that is in the tube.  It's like a bi-facil product. * Hydrates well, i found a solution to the seperation issue!! All you need to do is massage it with a closed cap for 2-4 minutes then put it in some hot water for 4 minutes and then shake it!! It becomes all mixed together just as new * First time ordering but from other reviews seems abnormal that the product is watery and separated. Even tried shaking it each time before using and still a ton of water comes out before any other product. Not sure how well it works since stopped using because of this. * I bought this moisturizer to help my dry winter skin and it did do that! It relieved the tight feeling on my face and made my skin feel/look glowy in the morning. However, it was a very greasy feeling product and I would only use it at night. Like a lot of other people, mine was very watery when I first got it. That was a bit frustrating because it was super messy. I still used the watery part and I think the effect was the same though. Once I used it for a week or so, it came out as a cream. Overall, I enjoyed it but hoping to find less greasy alternatives."

After two uses, my skin was visibly red, tingly, textured, and incredibly itchy. Unfortunately think this damaged my barrier as my skin is still recovering using other tried and tested products. If you have sensitive skin, I'd skip. * Oh how I wanted to love this. The ingredient list looks nice, and I'd heard good reviews, but unfortunately this cream just did not work out for me. I have no idea what's causing it, but this moisturizer somewhat burns my skin every time I apply it. It also seems to be making my facial eczema worse. The texture is different, more of a whipped consistency, but still hydrating. I feel like my skin might need more moisture though. It's also expensive for what it is. Unfortunately it's too late for me to return it, and since it was pricey I'm going to use it up anyways, but I would not repurchase. Honestly you can find many just as good-if not better face creams out there with similar ingredients, that cost much less. * Made skin dry and itchy, not moisturizing. * I use this over the mad hippie super A serum, at night before I go to work.

And the fact that this has SPF is just a cherry on top. * I'm a huge fan of the moisture surge hydrator and figured this would be the perfect addition of spf to my skincare routine.  I was wrong.  It feels like the moisturizer just sitz on the skin surface and dries.  When it dries, my skin gets tight.  It doesnt blend with Clinique liquid foundation and ends up being a pill-y mess.

I only need to blot once a day at work instead of three! * I have used FAB products before. Always liked their daily moisturizer but i have oily skin so it didn't help, but this oil control moisturizer helps a lot. My skin doesn't look as shiny. Perfect product for summer. It is not heavy at all. * In my search for an oil-free moisturizer this was recommended. I used this for a month and loved it. No breakouts, controlled my oily skin and seemed to work really well. So, I stocked up and got more. I noticed something was different after the 3rd use of the new jar. I started breaking out. I haven't broken out in almost 3 years. I was confused and continued to use it because why would it start breaking me out now? I loved the first jar. I'm not sure if the formula changed or if my skin is just being finicky. 

Overall, I recommend the product because it seems to be very good. It's a struggle for us oily girls to find products that offer us a balance of hydration while keeping oil at bay. I hope it works for you if you try it :) * Ever since Neutrogena discontinued their Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin - my holy grail of moisturizers - I have been desperately searching for a replacement that will keep my breakouts under control without over-drying my skin. The search is finally over - this is it!! My skin starting clearing up and looking healthier after the first overnight application! I've now been using it for 2 months and it's continued to significantly reduce my breakouts (in frequency and duration) without drying out my skin. The only downside is that the container is about half the size I was assuming it would be, based on other FAB products I've purchased. (Although that's on me for not looking at the size printed on the front of the product.) Each container lasts me a little over 2 months with one application per day on my face and sometimes neck and/or chest. Honestly though I'm in love. * Ive used this product for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin and have used several different face moisturizers over the years and this is the only one that keeps my face from getting super shiny by the end of the day, even with serums underneath it. It WORKS so to me its worth every penny! * This is the best moisturizer I have ever found for my oily skin! I have an oily t-zone and this keeps my skin from becoming oily all day. I worked an 8-hour shift wearing this and when I got home my forehead was still dry, but not peeling, it just felt finally normal. I use this on my entire face, but keep in mind you can use it only in certain areas that you struggle with oil, so don't let other reviews about dry skin deter you. With winter coming up I may begin to only use this on my oily areas and another moisturizer on others, but this is literally the holy grail moisturizer for anyone struggling with oily skin. * I have combination skin and this has saved my skin texture and made it so soft. The consistency feels so nice and it's not overly drying even in my dry areas. Feel like it's reduced some redness as well."

Waste of money. * I loved this product, but my latest bottle is grossing me out. I probably wont purchase again…When I bloom the moisturizer, water keeps coming out. The moisturizer is also just not the same. For this price, I'm pretty bummed at the quality of the product. * I like the brand and ive used their tinted spf moisturizer, the serums, and the hand cream, loved all of them. When i got the daily moisturizer recently it had separated so the first few pumps was all liquid and every time I've applied it my skin had a burning sensation and turns my entire face red for about 10 minutes😡.  
Definitely recommend a patch test * When applying to my face it burns like CRAZY for a few minutes. No allergic reaction or anything, and the sensation goes away, but I don't feel comfortable using it on my face anymore. The skin on your body is tougher and I don't get any burning sensation when using it on my body so I think I will use it as a body cream now. It is pretty thick too. 
I've noticed some people love this moisturizer and some experience sensitivities so it really does depends on your skin. It's important to PATCH TEST! * Im not sure why but when it arrived it was completely separated. Its just liquid that comes out when i push down on the bottle.

48,beautycounter,countercontrol matte effect gel cream,pimprod2038172,2606559," * If you truly have oily skin, you know the difference in a review from someone with oily skin vs someone whos skin gets oily.  I have oily skin and probably spend upwards of $1K a year on products trying to find things that actually do as they claim, and this is one of them.

I was a little reluctant to purchase this as the price is pretty high for a brand I've never used, but I'm glad that I took the risk on it.  Prior to this moisturizer I was either using none at all (because most others just make me more oily, dont need redundant products on oily skin), or I was using the La-Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Matte one which didn't do much for me. Obviously how this will work for you is going to be different for everyone, and the other products you use prior to your moisturizer will make a difference as well.

For reference I am a 28 yr old female, white/Caucasian.  My morning routine is: wash with a clay based cleanser (Dermalogica), tone (Fenty Skin), hyperpigmentation serum (Good Molecules), niacinamide/zinc serum (Sunday Riley), then this moisturizer. The consistency of this product is great for oil as it is a gel based product, but it comes out more opaque white than clear which is fine. It does not have much of a fragrance that I have noticed, but I'm not sensitive to fragrance so I wouldn't be one to say. When I put this on it almost feels as if it is a crossover between a moisturizer and a makeup primer that blurs your pores.  Now it does not make your pores go away by any means, but it does HELP.  Immediately after applying my skin is definitely mattified but again, not completely shine free as if it is a primer with the sole purpose of making your skin look like it has powder on it. It does not make my skin feel tight and dried out, it genuinely makes me feel moisturized and smooth without the glowy look that normal moisturizers do. From my experience it definitely does not keep me matte for 8 hours, I would say after about 3-4 hours I start to see shine on my face to the point where I feel the need to blot if I were going out somewhere (this is all without wearing makeup or anything on top of my morning skin routine, I work from home).

If you truly have an oily/combo skin type this is not going to be your holy-grail product that makes all of your problems disappear (will continue to search for it), but if it is within your budget for a product of this type then this is 100% top 5 best moisturizers for oily skin on the market right now in my opinion after having used this for a few weeks now.  Would repurchase (and I rarely ever find products I do)!  

I also just want to throw out there that I did buy this on my own, was not asked/paid to write this, and I think this is either my only review I've ever written on Ulta or one of a few over a span of years that I don't even remember. * The packaging is very luxe but the pump feels like its empty and its still half full. It doesn't mattify anything but it is a nice mix of a gel and lotion and a lightweight moisturizer. This is an MLM and I do feel it's overpriced for what it is. It's pretty basic. * Matte effect that works great as a moisturizer/ primer for oily skin types"

It's very lightweight and absorbs quickly. * I don't love it. It's good for a quick moisturizer in the summer after the pool or the have in the drawer when I run out of my stuff. I feel like it makes my skin look extra textured too. Once I run out I won't purchase again. I love the price point and wish it worked out for me better. * Hands-down my favorite moisturizer. I've repurchased half a dozen times, which is unheard of for me! I have *extremely* sensitive skin prone to rosacea, and this feels comforting every time. My skin is very dry so I use more than one moisturizer, but this is always the first one because it is makes such a nice base. I like to add a few drops of jojoba oil to it. Soaks in nicely without making my skin feel tight. I think it could work for oily skin as well if you just use a pea sized amount (though some with oily skin might find the avocado oil to be too much). I seriously hope they never discontinue this, I would recommend it to everyone! * I will be ordering this again and again! Always  feels good and moisturizing, without feeling or looking greasy!🥰 * Overrall this moisturizer is good and I would recommend for someone with oily skin, but it just does the bare minimum for skincare. Probably wont repurchase unless looking for something lightweight. * I absolutely love this moisturizer!  It's super lightweight yet provides just the right amount of hydration to keep my skin feeling soft and smooth all day. It absorbs quickly, doesn't feel greasy, and layers beautifully under sunscreen and makeup.

I have combination skin, and this moisturizer balances it perfectly—hydrating the dry areas without making my T-zone oily. Plus, I love that it has simple, skin-friendly ingredients with no unnecessary fragrances or irritants.

For the price, this is an amazing staple in my routine. If you're looking for an affordable, lightweight moisturizer that actually works, this is it!"

I have very dry skin due to an auto immune and this has been the only moisturizer on the market that I have found that actually moisturizes my skin. It not only gives my skin a beautiful, dewy, and hydrated look/feel, but it also blends well with most of my foundation. * Moisturizes my thirsty skin without being greasy! * I have mature skin and have been looking for something that was good for super dry skin and this has been great! * This product saved my life!!!  I'm going through menopause and my skin changed big time!  It turned into skin dryer then the Mojave desert!  Nothing was working anymore & my makeup looked terrible until I found this MIRACLE IN A JAR!!!  It saved my skin and I was able to be confident wearing my makeup again!!!  Please do not stop making this!!!  If you are a menopausal woman with extremely dry skin try this product!! It will save your life!!  It's also amazing on my dry winter hands too! * I absolutely love this moisturizer it's not to heavy but very hydrating. * I struggled for YEARS as an adult with dry, irritated and pimply skin, trying countless products. Once I started using this moisturizer, all of my problems went away. I'll never use anything else! * Not worth the buy, you can find other or better moisturizers that fit your skin type with better results.

This product listed shea as an ingredient as does the aforementioned. Well, my skin hasn't been clearer, pores smaller, literally no makeup other than a mineral spf. I'm stunned with the results in two weeks.

I apply it over sunscreen during the day and it doesn't pill like every other product. It also has a light, fresh, and beautiful scent. I'm a repeat customer. * I used this moisturizer a couple years ago but I then stopped using it because I wanted to experiment which one works best on me. I found myself going back to this one (aqua bomb), and it is amazing. It doesn't break you out, it soothes well, stays on your face all day, and doesn't grease you up. This is by far the BEST moisturizer I've used by far. I have recommended it to friends and they love it. I have a combination skin type, but within each season it feels different, but still, this is magic on your skin * I went through 2 jars of this and loved the way my skin looked and felt.  Third time was a disaster.  My face is breaking out in hard bright red patches and is burning starting with the first use of latest jar. So bummed, can't use or recommend after loving so much. * I love this moisturizer so much.  It's light and feels so soft on my face after applying, almost like powder.  The scent is so nice too. * I was given a small size to try, its incredible. Will definitely purchase!!! * Got a free sample of this (foil packet) and really liked it. Bought it on a 5x points sale (love those). Am enjoying it. I have seen a lot less dryness in my skin since I started using this. I have combo skin...T zone oil but dry around mouth corners and centers of cheeks. I'm in my early 50s. * I really like this moisturizer. I tried it for the first time and it absorbs quickly but is moisturizing gor my combo skin."

But I am utterly disappointed. It caused severe eye irritation that i had to go see an ophthalmologist. No sunscreen has caused me such reaction so i was worreid. However i do think it's a good moistirozer with SPF but its just not for me. * This moisturizer initially feels amazing on the skin, and it worked well under my makeup. However, after a few hours, my eyes began to burn and sting! It happened on 2 separate days so i know that it is this moisturizer. Again, i really wanted to like this but it really irritates my eyes. * This is a really great SPF moisturizer. It really holds up to its name. I've been looking at this brand for months and finally got it. I've only been using this for a little under a week but this by far, has been the best SPF moisturizer I've EVER used. Someone who works at Ulta said this was a really great product; she was correct. What sold me is when she said it holds up really well for people who have oily skin, which is an issue for me so I have an issue with products that make my skin extra oily. This is very lightweight and worth the money. I just need to see how this holds up with this FL heat. * I thought this was the perfrct match for me as i am lazy and hate having to layer moisturizer with an SPF and get greasy quick. This dries down matte at first but within an hour or so is super greasy and makes my face very shiny. For the price I expected better. * I tend to find most sunscreens to be greasy, oily, or sticky even when they claim otherwise. I assumed this would be the same especially since its a sunscreen moisturizer combo. However I was wrong!  The texture and finish is so so lovely. It's very lightweight and glides on nicely, moisturizes without leaving me feeling like a shiny greasy mess! It's perfect under make too. Highly recommend! * It is weightless but it burns yours eyes terribly when you go to take it off ...and it's not sweat proof...for the almost $50 this is I expect more out of a spf moisturizer. There are drugstore brands that can offer the same for a way less price point. Definitely returning."

I know the reviews aren't good but; I had a  free sample of the face wash first, so I knew i would like it. I would say this if u don't like scented or oil on ur face, then pass on this. I love alot of moisturizer on my face so it doesn't bother me at all! Also I have eczema and it doesn't break me out although it's scented 😳 I love it! Love it! * Sometimes when I buy kits, I'll use most of them (but not all of them). With this kit, I use every single one of the products in here and I LOVE them! * I am SO VERY HAPPY I was able to purchase this set for my BIRTHDAY MONTH!!!!!  I am officially 51 years old.

TULA has some of the ABSOLUTE BEST ANTI AGING AND SPECIFIC ROUTINE ADDRESSING PRODUCTS!!!!!!   I have had issues with drying skin around my mouth (upper area to chin).  And i have used everything under the sun!  However when i got to use the TULA 24/7 cream:  I WAS INCREDIBLY HAPPY!!!!!!!!!  Finally my skin is HYDRATED AND FEELING WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!  And I not oily on my forehead or nose!!!!!!!!!!  Love, LOVE TULA PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!! * This product made my oily face feel even greasier. * I did not like any product in this bundle. The facial cleanser doesn't get makeup off well. The moisturizer left my skin greasy, The brightening undereye stick didn't do anything but make my concealer go on wrong. * I love tula and a lot of there products however, definitely try one of there products before getting this bundle! I have sensitive skin and rosacea, i tried there firming moisturizer first before i bought this to see if i would have a reaction to tula products
The bundle is definitely a great deal and so far i have no issues or no break outs, its been a week! * Tula has helped my skin so much! I was scared to use it at first because my skin is so sensitive! But since ive been using i dont get big painful breakouts anymore! My skin is clear, soft, and glowing!

This is it! Love the clean ingredients and that it doesnt have much of a smell. My husband has even started using it, and that is saying something. * I have tried so many moisturizers. I have sensitive skin and I am also very careful with certain ingredients I use on my skin. This is the best moisturizer, it's hydrating but not greasy and great for day or night. I just mix it with my sunscreen in the morning. * I wanted to love this moisturizer because its clean- I didn't even mind the smell even though some complain about it. But I noticed after several weeks of use, I had many blackheads on my nose and chin. I didn't realize it wasn't non-comedogenic so that was on me for not paying attention. If you have acne or get breakouts, I wouldn't recommend this. * I wish the people who get the products for FREE other wise known as influencers would just be honest. I found it no big deal I've used other products for alot less money, but the 5 ⭐ crews won't be getting free stuff if they don't give a high score. Wait a few weeks to buy it and if you don't like return it, so this is an HONEST review. * Love it!! * I highly recommend this! I kept finding moisturizers that either broke me out or pilled on my face (deal breaker). This one does neither and keeps my face moisturized. It is on the pricey side, but I bought it on sale. The only thing I don't love is the smell. At first it just smells like nothing, but once I rub it in it's almost a chemical smell? Not sure, but I'll take that over not breaking me out. * It goes on like silk and makes your face feel soft and smooth. Feels good after I put on my toner and serums and then it's like a nice after finish. Good smell. Overall the best moisturizer I've used. Somewhere between a gel and a cream"

I have dry, red patches of skin around my nose, while my t-zone tends to be oily. Somehow this manages to keep my dry areas hydrated, and overtime reduce the redness, while keeping my oily areas from getting greasy. * I always come back to this product. Best ive used and it keeps me hydrated without feeling or looking greasy. Lays beautifully under makeup too. * I was looking for something very hydrating to use as a night time moisturizer for my dry skin. This moisturizer smells great (a light fresh citrusy scent) and melts into the skin nicely but it is light enough that I could use it as a daytime moisturizer, and it's probably not even moisturizing enough for that. My skin has been dry and flaky since I have switched to this. Maybe ok for oily skin, but not hydrating enough for dry skin. * Love it goes on smooth.. not sticky. Light weight and very moisturizing. * I've never left a skin product review, but I feel compelled. I've been using this close to a year, and if I run out it is definitely noticeable! This keeps me moisturized (I have dry skin) and skin feels more plump. I can finally stop the never ending hunt. * Great purchase! * I like this product and I would remind it to anyone who ask me what do you use for your face and I would tell why it it works for me."

It goes on smooth but 5 minutes later it has basically evaporated and my skin is dry again. * This product is really nice, don't get me wrong, although there are a few changes I would make, this product leaves my face feeling fresh. But it's kinda heavy on the skin. Another thing I have VERY sensitive skin so after applying it burns. * I was talked into trying Drunk Elephant, this is seriously just as good. I was really impressed with this product given the cost. I was thinking it would be too light for winter, but i was happy to discover that it has a nice thick consistency and long lasting coverage. It's hydrating 12+ hours for me, even though it's during a dry winter. * Love this product! It's so light weight and refreshing * I loved this moisturizer! The problem with it is that it is very watery and pretty much slips off my finger when I try applying it * this moisturizer has a watery, milky, serum-like consistency. it goes on easily and absorbs quickly. it does help control oil and minimize the appearance of pores. it also seems to improve texture a bit. however, it burns and stings like crazy for a few minutes after initial application, and leaves skin quite red. (i do not have sensitive skin/allergies). the redness and irritation goes away shortly, but i can't say this unenjoyable experience is worth the potential benefits, considering the moisturization is very poor. i feel a more hydrating moisturizer is necessary to use on top of this one. in summary, a bit irritating and not very hydrating, would not recommend for sensitive or dry skin. * This moisturizer has a serum- like texture and SLAYS! Ive wanted this since FOREVER!"

Would love to try the mist also * As other reviewers said it causes little white pumps on my t zone area and it doesn't do anything. * This product is very moisturizing I have been using this for 2 weeks and it's amazing * not a bad moisturizer but not the greatest either. its great for warmer weather since its lightweight and doesnt make your skin greasy. the moisture doesnt last all day through the colder weather though. * not a bad moisturizer but not the greatest either. its great for warmer weather since its lightweight and doesnt make your skin greasy. the moisture doesnt last all day through the colder weather though. * I was looking for a hydrating moisturizer that would not leave my skin looking oily but I'm still seeing some dryness around my problem areas

Currently using tret .025% and a compound of azaelic/spirono/nicotinamide for hormonal acne, and this repair cream keeps my skin from drying out into a red crusty flake.

And I can honestly say.. this product rocks!! Absolutely love the convenience of the travel size, it packs a punch and smells great too! * I have dry skin and since I started using Dermalogica stabilizing repair cream I had breakouts on the chin area that I usually don't have. Lots of little pimples so I'm guessing this moisturizer doesn't work well ok dry/sensitive skin. I can feel the hydration it leaves on the skin but it doesn't work for me. Gifted by dermalogica to give my honest opinion * Gifted by Dermalogica for review purposes.
This cream is so calming and soothing. I was surprised by how amazing it felt the first time I applied it. The texture is on the thicker side, but it feels nourishing on my skin, not heavy at all. I have eczema and rosacea and the Stabilizing Repair Cream is now at the top of my list. I am able to use it in my day and night routines and it fits right in. 
I also love that it has the Seal of Acceptance from the National Eczema Association. I trust products with the seal as they are always great for my skin. * This Dermalogica Stabilizing Repair Cream is REALLY great! I love the texture, it's nice and thick, and it's perfect for the winter and at night! I wish I'd gotten a full size, because I love it! It's one of the best creams I've tried in a long time, and that's saying a lot, because I try new creams all the time! I'll definitely be buying a full size!

It hydrates without feeling as greasy as the OG, and my skin feels more balanced through the day. I took off one star because it has a smell I can only liken to algae? Sort of a bad, musky, salty smell. But the product is good and I recommend it if you can handle the smell for a half hour until it disspates. If you're sensitive to smells like this I could see it being a problem for you. * I bought this by accident when I was trying to buy the 24-7 day and night moistue. First thing  I noticed was the color, which made me realize I had bought the gel cream. The weightless texure is nice but the smell is absolutely awful. I will not be using this product due to the smell. * I bought this when my previous moisturizer was about to run out. This was on sale and the reviews seemed overall positive. I've used it twice and it's going in the trash. It has a nice, lightweight feel on my skin but the smell is awful. I can't tell if it's supposed to be scented or if it's the smell of just the ingredients but it smells like it's gone bad. There are so many other moisturizers out there that work well, are half the price, and don't leave you smelling like something expired. * Absolutely love this! I never put lotion on my face and just started using this product and I get so many compliments now how nice I look and young. I am almost 45 but I don't look it. * My beauty consultant, Beautifull (yes! that is her name) is the best in the business! I had so many questions when I was looking for a skin routine. I must say my skin is WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. She is located in North Texas! * I stopped buying moisture surge (and clinique in general) earlier this year, and searched for a comparable moisturizer all of 2024. Out of the 15 products I tried this year, this has been the best option by far. I honestly think this gel moisturizer is even better than Clinique's because it's fragrance free and 100% cruelty free. So many moisturizers are also too heavy for my sensitive and acne prone skin, but this is so lightweight and absorbs quickly. It's definitely worth the price, and a little goes a long way. * This is so light and so hydrating, it does not leave any sticky residue on the skin and no harsh smell.

I will usually develop irritations to products as I continue to use them (just some examples - La Roche Posay cleanser, Cocokind moisturizers, Clinique moisturizers, Aveeno oat cleaners, First Aid Beauty moisturizer, the list goes on with high end and drugstore products that end in irritation and sometimes acne flares). 
This cream can be Applied during my most irritated times and does not burn one bit. This is truly the only item i am extremely loyal to and recommend to EVERYONE. * This is amazing for rosacea and sensitive skin. * I almost exclusively use Avene at this point because I break out with the teeniest of fragrances. As I've gotten older, my rosacea has taken center stage. This calms it down. A tube lasts months. This lays perfectly under every makeup I use with no pilling. I don't tend to wear tons of foundation because my skin is absolutely radiant, but I can use full coverage MAC, Tarte, Dior, it all goes on flawlessly.  I layer different skincare year round but this is my always moisturizer. * I've tried many moisturizers and serums to fix my skin barrier after I destroyed it doing a 10 step care routine. So far, this works to make my cheeks less red without giving me acne. It also lessened a wrinkle caused by an acne scar. * I originally bought this product when it was on sale. I liked it well enough, but it ended up taking a backseat to my other well-loved lotions and creams. Then I got pregnant and developed cystic acne on my chin that was painful, and I couldnt get it to go away. I tried switching out my favorite Cerve nighttime cream for this Avene cream and OMG those large, deep pimples cleared up in a matter of days! I'm so thankful I had this on hand and will definitely be repurchasing. * Worked wonders for me and all the small bumps on my skin disappeared after using this * I absolutely love this stuff and always have a bottle on hand! Its great for sensitive skin that is prone to irritation. Any time I've had skin reactions on my face, this is the product I reach for to help with the itchiness and dryness. It's very hydrating (a bit thicker) while still working well with oily skin. I especially love using this in the colder and drier winter months."

It has been about six months of active breakouts, where I wake up with a new pimple or cyst every single day, and the marks can't be covered by makeup. I added this to my nighttime skincare routine (every other day) a little over a week ago and I am pimple-free for the first time since summer. I have also recently started a skin supplement, so I do think the combination of those together is what's made the difference, but for $8 this is incredible. I am so happy with how quickly I saw results and how my face does not hurt anymore!! I will say this dried me out pretty bad as someone who already had dry skin, so I keep the rest of my routine pretty hydrating to even that out. But yes I love this it's definitely worth the buy for adult hormonal acne!! * I have repurchases this so many times!! this is the perfect retinol for anyone in their 20s who doesn's need a steong retinol yet. sinks into the skin so well and makes a huge difference in texture and brightness! * really like it. It's a cream with a light smell. About the same quality as the ordinary. Only down side is the aluminum packaging. Works at a decent pace. would by again * I started using this last year and have loved it! Its gentle enough im able to use every night, no irritation whatsoever, in fact id say its actually a bit hydrating! I love it! I did try an actual retinol serum (from a different brand) when I had ran out of my 2nd tube thinking i was ready to move up to a higher percentage- i threw it away, it was so oily and it smelled so bad! I immediately returned to this cream! I do just wish higher percentages were available as i do still think i can do more than the 0.1% retinol thats in here. Until that happens though, i will always use this retinol cream! * I use strong retinols all the time and this gave me the worst rashes. The tube also sucks and profuct is wasted. I thought the smell was off. * This was my first time using retinol and i highly recommend especially for the price. My face was smoother after a couple uses. There are some reviews saying they had bad reactions, but don't forget that it is retinol! Everyones skin reaction is different. And for the price, it's really not bad compared to other prices. It's honestly worth a shot."

I have combo skin and my skin somehow manges to look greasy and dry at the same time and this totally reverses that. My skin becomes glowy and hydrated without looking oily. Different things work for different people, but id say this is worth a try!"

It's not the niacinamide because I use that in my perscription, but something in here, my skin doesn't like. * It's great for sensitive combination skin ... And then it pills. I've been trying to figure out if it was my serums, the combo used with my foundation, or sunscreen. Even when I've worn it by itself it still clumps and pills off. It looks absolutely terrible under makeup after a full day of work. * It was good and hydrsting until i would touch my face and it would come off in chunks

I love the way it moisturizes and doesn't leave a greasy feel. Skin on my face feels so soft all day long. Had to buy a full size and now the gift one is in my travel bag. * My mother bought this product and I noticed it had a strong fragrance to it. Now I'm not a dermatologist, but I have enough knowledge to know that anything fragrance is horrible for your skin. Anyway, my skin broke out in hives when I tried this product, along with acne. Please don't buy skincare from Lancome, it's not the best for most people. * I love how this looks on my skin! It's matte but hydrating. Happy that it has hyaluronic acid as well. My makeup looks so good now! I used to use tatcha but didn't like oily it made my skin look. This will now be my go to! * I have normal to dry skin, but a lot of moisturizers will clog my pores if i sleep in them. I just stopped wearing a mositurizer to bed altogether for a while for this reason. When I saw the ingredients in this I became curious and decided to give it a try. My skin is so hydrated and looks beautiful in the morning! Also, if i develop a blemish during the day, I will still slap this moisturizer on top of it at night and not only does it not make it worse, it actually heals it and my skin clears up so much faster! Highly recommend this product. * This was recommended to me by the consultant and I love it."

It's very lightweight and absorbs quickly. * I don't love it. It's good for a quick moisturizer in the summer after the pool or the have in the drawer when I run out of my stuff. I feel like it makes my skin look extra textured too. Once I run out I won't purchase again. I love the price point and wish it worked out for me better. * Hands-down my favorite moisturizer. I've repurchased half a dozen times, which is unheard of for me! I have *extremely* sensitive skin prone to rosacea, and this feels comforting every time. My skin is very dry so I use more than one moisturizer, but this is always the first one because it is makes such a nice base. I like to add a few drops of jojoba oil to it. Soaks in nicely without making my skin feel tight. I think it could work for oily skin as well if you just use a pea sized amount (though some with oily skin might find the avocado oil to be too much). I seriously hope they never discontinue this, I would recommend it to everyone! * I will be ordering this again and again! Always  feels good and moisturizing, without feeling or looking greasy!🥰 * Overrall this moisturizer is good and I would recommend for someone with oily skin, but it just does the bare minimum for skincare. Probably wont repurchase unless looking for something lightweight. * I absolutely love this moisturizer!  It's super lightweight yet provides just the right amount of hydration to keep my skin feeling soft and smooth all day. It absorbs quickly, doesn't feel greasy, and layers beautifully under sunscreen and makeup.

I have combination skin, and this moisturizer balances it perfectly—hydrating the dry areas without making my T-zone oily. Plus, I love that it has simple, skin-friendly ingredients with no unnecessary fragrances or irritants.

For the price, this is an amazing staple in my routine. If you're looking for an affordable, lightweight moisturizer that actually works, this is it!"

I've never left a review before, but I felt the need to get on here and tell everyone to save their time and money. For context, I have dry skin and moisturize twice a day. This moisturizer does nothing to actually hydrate the skin, and it immediately pills all over the face. In just trying to rub it in, with NO other products on my face, it pilled and did not absorb in the slightest. I had to go wash it off. Now I have to take the time to go return it… * I originally purchased this for by husband to try for his dry skin on his face because of exema, but although he really likes the non greasiness it didn't really help him much so he went back to Aveeno, but I tried this and I love it. It truly love the way it makes my face feel soft and very hydrated. Now I use it as a bedtime routine of my face care. Love it!!!! * All of the good ingredients and none of the bad. It's a thick cream, but goes on very lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving zero tackiness. Fragrance free, and not scented. Excellent value! * I wanted to love this so much ... but it pills on the skin.  So disappointed 😞 * I live this product so much. I use it at night and it works so well * Not good it did not hydrate my skin * Gentle and fragrance free cream does well on my sensitive skin. Not greasy at all and absorbs well.

Issue is, after a while of daily use, my skin would feel dry; even patchy. Wouldn't wear underneath make-up, for sure. * I was using the glow watermelon and it was alright but my skin now is so soft and looks so healthy and it really glows without feeling greasy or making me look super oily"

I will continue to use it but wish there was a fragrance free version. * I have used this product for years, it clears my face leaves it smooth and young looking. I recommend this product * I bought the Lancome holiday gift pack with this included. Otherwise I don't think I would've ever bought it. Out of the entire set this is the one I use consistently because of the way it feels. Woke up today and forgot I used to have age spots. They're gone. * This has a strong perfume smell.  I bought it half off during days of beauty.  Reviews are good but that strong perfume smell.  might use it on chest instead of face to use up. * Ive tried a lot of face creams, this is definitely in my top 3. This cream is ideal for mornings where you want something moisturizing but not too oily. I can also see a difference in brighness and fine lines. I also feel like this cream works with most skin types. I have dry skin and it works well as a day cream. * About two months ago I received a super sample of this and I was SHOCKED at the difference in my skin within 48 hours. My fine lines were already fading and my skin was taught. At 46 years old I've tried every serum and moisturizer, including high end brands such as Sunday Riley and Drunk Elephant only to be left with little to no results and wasted money. This particular line of Lancome products is expensive and beyond my normal budget but it is worth every penny. I just started using the serum and these products have changed my life. I will always look for the best sales and discounts but if I would pay full price because this moisturizer is magic and now a permanent staple in my skincare routine and I HIGHLY recommend this for all women my age and up in need of help fighting fine lines and wrinkles and skin elasticity. * This product has improved the appearance of my skin without causing any breakouts. I love the texture and it has a pleasant smell to it"

The duo smells nice and feels jice going on. Howecer this juice was not worth the squeeze and the dispenser clogged easily and often. * I went to buy a product that was highly recommended. The store associate introduced me to the Juice line, and it is the first product line that I honestly felt almost instantaneous results. * I started with the samples and i was really hoping I would hate it since it is so expensive. Unfortunately I loved it, and now I'm forced to spend a fortune on skincare. Use with their vitamin c, primer, foundation and translucent powder and your aging face will thank you, but your bank account won't. * I love juice beauty's products so I couldn't wait to try this product! I used it night cream the first night I got it and woke up and washed my face and placed on the day cream. Moments afterward my face began to feel very itchy and uncomfortable. If I would itch it would leave scratch welts all over my face (what it looks like when a dog jumps up and scratches you is the best way to describe it), followed by an itchy sensation from my head to my toes. Once I would itch I would get little hive bumps and the scratch welts all over my body. Very sad this product did not work out for me, but wanted to warn others that have sensitive skin. * This moisturizer is very thick and seems to be a great product with the exception of the smell. It is a vibrant apple/lemon like a candy. 
Reminds me of a teenage type product, unfortunately it is to potent to use at night, to try to fall asleep it just keeps me up."
84,fresh,rose deep hydration face cream,pimprod2025112,2584148," * Love the day and night cream * Huge fan of fresh products. Received in a sample and then bought the full size. Within 6 weeks my skin got so dry, tight, and inflamed. Acne sprung up. The skin especially around my chin / jaw / cheeks started cracking and scabbing. It smells and feels so nice but the end result over time was not good. Switched my moisturizer and immediately the cracking, inflammation, and acne went back to normal. 

Love Fresh but not this product. * They dont give that much product to see if it does anything and it clog my pours more * It works great. Its not greasy. It absorbs well, and my skin is soft. My sensitive skin is not adversly affected in any way. It's a good moisturizer, and it's light scent smells great. * I wanted to love this moisturizer because I've loved other products from Fresh and I love the scent, but it was very disappointing. I used it at night after my full routine, and noticed within about 30 minutes that my skin felt tight (not moisturized). It was like the product had dried into a layer sitting on top of my skin. The next morning my skin didnt feel well-hydrated at all, in fact I had dry patches in areas that would typically be fine with previous moisturizers I've used. Unfortunate for the high price point, but maybe it's just not for me. * I really really wanted to love this moisturizer because of the texture, fragrance and overall feeling when putting it on but the peeling is crazy! For the price this product should not be peeling off pf my face within 5 minutes of me putting it on. Love the texture + fragrance but hate the peeling. * I havd been using this for a while now and it pills like drazy after it dries down - which translates on the makeup since it comes off when you apply. I know its not my skin since i exfoliate - so it shouldn't be doing this. I'm disappointed."

For reference I was in shade 420 N in their foundation. This product does indeed leave a white cast and makes me look grey. This product leaves me feeling very greasy and if you add even the slightest too much of the product it moves and disrupts foundation put on top of it. I don't ever mind the price of a product so long as it works and sunscreen is so important is good to invest on a product that's literally protecting you but this isn't it. * Bought this when on sales. Its the best combo sunscreen with vitamin, primer and sunscreen all in one.  Love it! * This has way too much fragrance and smells like old lady perfume. Shame on me for not reading the ingredients, but not many of the recent reviews mention a strong perfume scent. But if you look at them, it has added fragrance.

The sunscreen itself is ok, but I wouldn't call it lightweight. It's definitely a thicker moisturizer/sunscreen and probably best suited for dry skin. My combo skin wasn't overly greasy, but for me it is just too heavy for daytime use. Also, It didn't do anything to help my makeup look better or last, so not that great as a primer.

I got it during the 21 days of beauty, and even at half price, it's way too much for this product. Other than vitamin E, there are no real skincare benefits in it. There are so many better sunscreens. I hate waste so I'll probably continue to use it as a body sunscreen. But with all the fragrance it's not going anywhere near my face. * Causes migraines for me * This was recommended to me by a store associate, I was looking for a SPF with moisturizer, so I purchased it and I absolutely love it. It leaves my skin feeling silky and my foundation application goes on smoothly.  I've gotten great compliments indicating my makeup looks great when wearing this underneath.  First time user and will keep this as my staple. * Every once in awhile a sunscreen will slightly burn my eyes. When I used this product for the first time, the burning of a thousand suns hit me and I had to remove my contacts and wash my face (not ideal when trying to get to work). My eyes burned most of the day and were sensitive to light. It took an hour before I could drive to work and even then they were still tearing up badly."

Best of all, it does not burn my eyes!!  I apply it alone to my neck after serums and moisturizer but do mix with my foundation when I apply to my face. * I was given the sunscreen by my mom try, but after a few weeks of using it I notices it made my skin extremely dry. It also caused my make up to separate even when allowing 15 minutes to dry before applying foundation. I've increased my moisturizer usage hoping that would help offset the dryness, but it has not helped at all. This sunscreen has an odd smell to it. * I've had such a hard time finding a face sunscreen that didnt mess with my skin or makeup and this is it! I'm obsessed with how easy it is to apply after my skincare and it was no issue at all with my makeup after application! It doesn't have a typical sunscreen smell. I will say, for someone like myself who had oily combo skin, this might be a hit or miss for you, but for myself personally I didn't mind it at all :) * My sister-in-law got this and I've always wanted to try it and have it my own and I love it 😊 * Smells terrible and goes on like flaky paste. Overall gross feeling. Very dissatisfied. * I've tried countless sunblocks, most of which caused me breakouts and I usually hate the way they feel on my skin or smell. This one is my GOAT. It layers well over my other skincare and makes a great primer for makeup. I always repurchase this."

So purchase if they have original * In my constant quest for skincare products that deliver real results, I recently tried the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid. This lotion claims to gently exfoliate, boost cell turnover, and provide deep hydration to uncover softer, smoother skin. Let's dive into my experience with this multi-tasking formula.

The lotion is non-greasy and lightweight, making it perfect for daily use. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and hydrated without any heavy residue. The product is fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for those with sensitive skin or a sensitivity to strong scents. The natural smell from the lactic acid salts is subtle and varies slightly depending on your skin's unique pH, but it's not overpowering or unpleasant. * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is revolutionary! It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy!"

My skin felt so plump and hydrated, with slightly reduced redness. I'm saving up to put this amazing cream again. The texture is thick, but absorbed well. Love it a lot!! * This product is very thick and little bit goes a long way.  I have been using it consistently for a week and my skin feels so soft. My skin has the tendency to be very dry and flaky especially with it being so cold and windy.  My skin is loving the extra moisture it is getting. * Perfect addition to my night time skin care routine. So buttery and moisturizing. It is too thick for me to use during the daytime under my makeup, but I just use the original tula for that :) * This is an excellent moisturizer for dry and irritated skin!I use it nightly after my prescription acne treatments and it really helps keep my skin hydrated and is very soothing. * I got this as a sampler and used it for about a week.  Everytime i put it on, it burned my face. I thought maybe it was one of the other serums i had on that was having a reaction to, but slowly began to realize it was this moisturizer. I am not experiencing a rash in my eye areas and cheeks. * I have combination, sensitive skin. I generally use a light weight moisturizer daily after showering and sometimes at night when I actually bother to wash my face. It's always worked great but I was experiencing a little bit of dryness so I decided to try this. It didn't irritate my skin at any point but it also didn't moisturize my skin. Trying to wear makeup only magnifies the dryness/flaking (and it's a hydrating CC cream). * I like to wear this at night. I put it on as the last step to my routine at night. It locks everything in beautifully and my skin feels nice and soft in the morning.

I've never tried it on under makeup as I light lighter creams under makeup."

I love how moisturized it leaves my skin & i love how i can go out with out any makeup and my skin looks so GREAT. It's seriously worth it. * I bought this as I was searching for an affordable dupe of the Tatcha moisturing cream. This is really close to it as it is hydrating, leaves your skin feeling and looking supple, and decent price point. Korean are known for their products and this one does not disappoint even during the winter dey weather, it hydrates and sits well under makeup.

Only con to me is the packaging. I wish it came in a tube for easier travel. * Got this as a freebie and I absolutely love it! I purchesed a bigger size. Its soo cooling and hydrating. Doesnt pill like some moistureizers and isnt sticky. * I have used this product for several year and loved it, but the new formula is drastically different and makes my skin burn and leaves my skin feeling greasy. The scent used to be a natural herbal scent, but now smells like chemicals. So sad and disappointed, I would've stocked up on the original formula if I'd know they were going to ruin it! * I'm not sure why rhis doesn't habe more reviews this is the best moisturizer ever.

However, the pump that the 22oz has is extremely problematic and wastes A LOT of product. It just keeps spewing it out and it gets absolutely everywhere. It's easy enough to just switch out the pump, but I shouldn't have to do that for a $50+ product. * Great product * I've been using this face wash for about 12 years. I have sensitive skin and it was the only thing I could use. When I went to buy a replacement I noticed the packaging slightly different. Then when I used it my face was burning. I still had the old bottle and compared ingredients which were different. Googled if they changed the formula and they did! Why take a perfectly fine thing and ruin it. Philosophy has lost me as a long time customer. I also used renewed hope in a jar which they discontinued. All their stuff now is trash. I will be returning this bottle. I'm completely disappointed in all these companies changing products that don't need changing. * I love Purity cleanser.  It's the best cleanser I've ever used.

At first I thought the cream would be too thick but i was wrong. You dont need a lot and my face is so soft after using it a few nights. I have noticed some difference already in my neck and face. * I have mature skin at 59. I started using this cream about 3 months ago. I only use this cream and the serum from this line, but I've noticed a significant difference in the firmness of my skin. I have weird skin. I had cystic acne when i was younger and now I'm dry most of the time. I was using Perricone MD but had used Clinique years ago. I was looking for something with a wow factor that was less pricey. I definitely found it in this cream! It's super creamy, doesn't take much product, absorbs like a dream. And fragrance free! * I find I can only use this at night because it sloughs off so much if applying foundation on top in the morning. Wish I would have just gotten the new night mask. * I feel like I've tried hundreds of different moisturizers. Many sit on top of my skin or feel heavy especially once you add sunscreen on top. This product absorbs quickly and actually makes my skin feel and look plumped. It also feels cool which I like a lot and has a clean, non-offending scent. It's a thick cream that's soft & pillowy and improves my skin's overall appearance. * I started with the sample.  I loved it.  Very creamy.  A little goes a long way. * I was concerned about the switch to a new line of creams as I've been using the old smart night cream for years as a night cream, but overall have been satisified with the change. I'm 29 and was recommended by an Ulta employee in the store the lifting face + neck cream. The cream is a completely new product. It is thicker, much firmer texture than the old one. It is also bright white. It does not have a noticeable fragrance. (The jar says fragrance free). I use it as a night cream and can definitely see and feel the difference in 'firmness' and 'lifting' in my neck; although I didn't think I really needed it and that wasn't why I used the original night cream. I have noticed some white heads in my forehead/T-Zone, but I tend to get them occasionally anyway so I can't blame the cream on it. After reading about the other variations, I wish I had the SPF version so I can try wearing it twice a day with my makeup over it. I'll be giving this one to my mom and trying the SPF one next. :) * This is returnef the plumpness to my cheeks has lifted my laugh lines and I don't look as sallow under my eyes. This cream is amazing I thought I needed a facelift but after using this clinically proven product were 100% of women saw results I'm in love. I've never had more compliments on my skin and I'm 62."

I don't need to smell like it though. otherwise it works great and I'll use it until it's gone, but I probably won't buy it again. * Makes your face smooth like a baby. * I love to try new products bit this is one I am committed to use! I've been using it for several years now and have probably used 6 jars of it. My skin continues to improve and my recent newcdrivers license picture clearly shows how much younger I look now than 4 years ago and I don't get any ""work"" done!  The dispenser is ingenious and doesn't waste product like so much packaging does. At first you must press several times to get it going; from thence on it dispenses the perfect amount.  Once it seems ""empty"", I pry it apart and find very little is left...maybe enough for one application, but clearly the packaging is designed so you get all the product with no effort and it cant be contaminated . I also use a Lancome serum every morning, and the two products seem to have made an amazing difference. * Within a few days I saw fine lines going away withour peeling or burning like a stronger retinol. Plus my skin still felt moistureized. Also, I really love the pump so it does not ruin the efficacy of the rest of the product. 10/10 * I have purchased this product before and especially like the way it controls the amount needed on the top. It also is a fantastic retinol seum in cream! Goes on smoothy and feels good on the skin. * I buy this It product when it is on sale,  as the product itself is OK.   HOWEVER, I wish they would change the pump lid....it works a few times and then stops.  You end up having to unscrew it just like a normal jar to get the moisturizer out.  It needs to stop wasting money on these lids and quit trying my patience.  A NORMAL Lid is preferred to one that quits working. * I love this serum!!

I have tried so many that leave your under eyes looking cakey or dry, or too hydrating where it becomes oily or sticky.

I have very sensitive skin and after seeing so many positive reviews/ recs from friends I decided to try it… This is the only thing I have changed in my routine and when I say my acne hasn't been this bad in a long time I mean it. It is SO so bad. Everywhere (face,neck,chest, upper arms) I used it is breaking out. Definitely returning this product! * this is the only moisturizer I can use on my sensitive dry skin. I've used it for years along with their gentle face wash. * I have extremely sensitive skin and live in a dry climate. I have tried multiple moisturizers ranging anywhere from more natural, low-ingredient to high-end, dermatologist grade. Everything either made me breakout, left my skin red and still dry, and in some cases even caused chemical burns. I've tried brands like CeraVe, Ethique, Clinique, Dermalogica, etc. and none seem to help. After doing some research, I saw others say this low-ingredient, fragrance-free moisturizer helped them. After only a few uses, I was AMAZED!! My skin stayed hydrated all day, was noticeably less red, and wasn't breaking out. 
I would say maybe start with the lotion if you're on the oily side or live in a more humid climate. But as someone with already dry, sensitive skin and living in a dry climate, this has worked WONDERS. Cannot recommend enough. I hope the formula never changes! * This was a highly recommended product on tiktok so of course i had to try it out. Its a good price for the amount you get, but not a good moisturizer in my opinion. The product did not absorb at all, sat on top of my skin all night, quite sticky, and made it impossible to get comfortable since my hair would get stuck to my face if i moved. Product also had an unpleasant smell. * I love that it's moisturizing, but having super sensitive skin like I do, I was expecting it to not make my face break out in a rash. * This product is awesome and helped soothe my daughters eczema on her hand"

It also doesn't have sunscreen, which is what I was looking for.  (I always wear sunscreen outside, but if I'm just going to be inside at the office, I'd rather not have it.)  It's a little pricey for the volume.  Because it's the thick plastic tube, you think you're getting more than you are.  Mine is depleting quickly.  I also wish it had different packaging in general, environmentally. * I have used this for almost a year now and my skin loves it!

No residue on my hands.  My face feels hydrated and soft all day long.  Would highly recommend and I plan to re-purchase for next summer!  (I need something heavier for winter months as I have very dry skin). * I enjoy this product - I feel like it does moisturize my face, and I love how it makes my skin feel. However, I feel like it could be just a little better. I find I need to use more than one pump, and I don't understand why I should need to use that much moisturizer. It does work, though. I'm curious to see how long the tube lasts! * Evryone seems to like this but i really dont it burns when i put it on and i feel like it may be worsening my acne im going to try the cera ve pm moisturizer and am one and hopefully those r better * I hate feeling greasy.

But so far, it's worth every penny. I have been using Mario Badescu for maybe 15 years-the oil free spf 30 moisturizer. It always has made my face red after applying and then of course I use my Jane Iredale loose powder to cover the redness and even out my skin. So now with this product, so no red face and it slides on nice and easily. It has a slight fragrance which is lovely and it doesn't bother my sensitive skin. I would give it a try if you're able. So far, it's been great for me. * Its over 100 dollars and its not a good product! And only onr ounce! DO. NOT. BUYYY! * Amazing face cream with spf.

I bought a small tube directly from The Ordinary website as part of a recommended regimen the website came up based on my skin type. I used all of the small tube, then came to Ulta to buy the larger size. I think it's doing alright in moisturizing my very dry skin overall. I am using it in the morning and at night. It you use more than a tiny bit, it does feel very greasy and the skin doesn't seem to drink it..it feels like it just sits on top. At night I feel the need to add more than I do in the morning so I do get this gross greasy feeling but I notice in the morning my skin looks good and feels moisturized so it's not doing a terrible job. 

The strange thing about it is that although while I'm applying it, I don't notice any scent, after a few minutes I get a faint scent, almost like gasoline, stuck in my nostrils and I can slightly taste it too. If I smell my hands directly (which I rub with left over product) I don't smell anything but somehow I pick up a scent/taste just from it being absorbed into my skin and it's a bit off-putting. Very chemically.

I'm not sure if I'm going to keep purchasing after I make it through this huge tube but for now it's ok enough to continue using until I finish and maybe experiment with something else. * I bought this moisturizer due to the reviews about it being great for dry skin. Unfortunately it did not feel hydrating at all it set on top of my skin like a greasy film and immediately began to pill off… will sadly be returning. * Great product and value. My 50 yo dry skin is loving it. My regular winter moisturizer just wasnt cutting it. This helps so much. Love! * This is incredibly moisturizing without being heavy. The big tube lasts a long time. * I live in CO and even face oils are not cutting it for keeping my skin hydrated. This moistizer is a holy grail in winter for keeping my skin consistently hydrated. I have oily skin thay tends to be dehydrated, as well as senstitive acne prone. Doesnt break me out at all * a little goes a long way. I also use it on my eye area. I have dry skin, in the winter it is upsetting how dry my skin gets. this moisturizer saved me from tears.

Great night moisterizer. * I recently downloaded the Yuka app and this product rated very good. After trying it, I'm sold. It's gentle enough for my sensitive skin and moisturizes great. I'll buy it again. * I am already on my 4th bottle * The actual cream, imo, is comparable to Biossance's overnight cream at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, the container is absolutely infuriating. It's clunky and makes it impossible to get all of the product out. * This is my teen daughter's favorite moisturizer. She loves it! * I love this moisturizer! I needed something thicker for the winter tine and this product has been helpful. I sometimes get small dry patches on my cheek and this works. Makes my skin so soft and smooth. * I am already on my 3rd bottle"

I use this with the TBT oil and my skin has been doing so well. My breakouts have cleared, and my skin overall just feels great. Hoping that this will help with spot corrections due to pregnancy. I've tried so many products in the past, and I'm so glad I found this. * This product made my face all fricking acne and never buy it it makes you get rinkles faster if I were you don't ever buy this product in your life!!!!!!!🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮😡😡😡😡😡 * I randomly bought this because I was out of moisturizer and the reviews were so high. This is the best moisturizer I have ever tried. I normally get an eczema breakout from the cold/dry weather but have not since using this. I just bought another but it lasted me a good 4.5 ish months. It's a bit thick but absorbs into the skin very fast and reduces fine lines and helps my makeup look better. * I randomly bought this because I was out of moisturizer and the reviews were so high.

I just bought another but it lasted me a good 4.5 ish months. It's a bit thick but absorbs into the skin very fast and reduces fine lines and helps my makeup look better. * Worked great the first couple times i used it, then every time i would use it after i noticed more break outs. * You really do have to follow the product directions (Use twice a week to start then ease into use). I have very sensitive combo skin so I have to be careful (I break out in a rash). Well, after using this product for over a month now, I can feel the difference in my skin. It's smoother and I feel like I'm not as oily prior to use. I only use it at night. The product itself is not greasy and a lot goes a long way. I have put this in my daily skin care regimen. * Love it and have had no reactions from it, which is saying domething."
121,clarins,multi-active day moisturizer for lines and glow with niacinamide,pimprod2043929,2620943," * Excellent product u can see the results immediately * My face is sensitive and oily to normal. This one moisturizer does it all for me. I'm scared to change. * This is an amazing day moisturizer that adds glow, is lightweight but has a luxurious, thick feel to it, smells heavenly (but very light). Filled with natural extracts and antioxidants, it has made a day for my combo skin in late 30s. My skin looks renewed: plump and radiant. Overall, this is better than many other more expensive options and even produces better anti-aging effects on my skin, compared to Clarins' own anti-aging line. I have purchased 3rd jar, and will probably stick with it moving forward as it is very good for my sensitive skin and doesn't clog pores, irritate, or dry it. Love it!!! * I am 55 with very dry skin. I tried this with the other Clarin's serums and even topped it with a vitamin C oil. I dont think it will work for winter. And, I dont see it working for a nightine cream during the winter. It would be a nice moisturizer for summer I believe if you have dry skin. 
For all the other skin types it might work well for you. * I really love this product. I've alternated between a variety of higher end brands over the last 14 years and this is my favorite, and I have tempermental skin. It's so worth it. * Smells absolutely awful. Like the most old-fashioned, cheap perfume. This is meant to be a day cream… I don't know why it smells so incredibly strong and cheap.  I also think I mistook Ulta's ""conscious beauty"" as meaning clean/good skincare.  But that is not what this is. Its full of synthetic/artificial crap… including dyes and fragrance. * I was really excited to try this cream and the first few days it was perfectly fine, until my face started to breakout really bad and still have some scars :("

Made my face super oily and kinda has a weird minty feeling when applied. I did not enjoy this experience. * This product is so expensive, but i think it can be worth it. I admit it is a little sticky on my face and skin, but that never bothered me. I dont have oily nor dry skin, I glow with this sunscreen on, i put it on before my makeup and it hasnt messed with the application. It doesnt clear my skin, but i dont break out from this product. I burn easily, yet I lathered up in this sunscreen ONE TIME in the morning during a very hot summer, laying exposed under the sun all day at the beach without reapplying and i left with no burn lines or nothing. However, Im unsure about how water resistant it is. The sunscreen is easy to apply, it rubs in so smoothly. Id recommend buying in store because when I ordered online once, the seal was leaking and i had to exchange it, so i would not risk it. While i do wish this was a bit cheaper for the amount of product i get, i havent bought from another brand since i got on this once. On top of that, i love the fragrance of it, it doesnt have that typical sunscreen smell to it which is a bonus. Overall, i havent had an unpleasant experience with this product so far! * This is the best everyday sunscreen and moisturizer you can use.I have a mature skin and my skin glows from this, I have worked as a medical iaesthetician and I would recommend this to everyone.. * I had tried before form a friend and had seen really good reviews.I finally decide to purchase and plan to do so feels so light weight and it melt into skin so easily there is no shine or sticky feeling like other products I have used and have not noticed and white spots * This completely changed my kids adversity to sunscreen. They will happily apply and re-apply this like any other moisturizer. My husband also doesnt mind reapply this even at work. I took my most recent jug on a bachelorette trip and we all left glowing without sunburning. * Really happy with this sunscreen so far! Usually my least favorite part about sunscreen is how oily and greasy I feel and look, but this one dries/absorbs really nicely so I do not look like I am shining/oily from the sunscreen layer.  I also haven't had any issues with staining on clothes, which I have had issues with other sunscreens. * This sunscreen is fantastic! Unlike most sunscreens, this one doesn't have a white cast and it doesn't feel sticky. It's expensive but definitely worth the price."

My state is very dry and I already have dry skin in the first place and this leaves a very nice cooling feeling and it leaves my skin looking so nice and soft * I purchase .5 ounce and I didn't realize how little I got.  it is trial size.  it isn't worth the money I spent and I will be returning it!!!! * There is nothing wrong with this cream. It's good for mild psoriasis, gentle on flakey skin and non-comedogenic. But I don't find it better than most other moisturizers and treatments for my occasional flakes. I find azelaic acid and retinoids produce better results, so this cream doesn't add much to my skincare routine. I'll use this up, but I don't see myself repurchasing this. * I have alwasy had sensitive skin and recently i just got really bad cystic acne and needed moisturizer that didnt sting my face and this did not bother my skin at all! Dont need a lot for whole face. * I've been using this product for about a week now, and I'm not very impressed. I've been using it morning and night, and continue to have dry skin. * it feels nice on my face but it burns my undereyes and doesn't feel hydrating enough :( but it did calm my acne since this is an oil free product. so i recommend this to oily type of skin."

I'm on my 4th bottle and feel that the ingredients do work * I wanted something a little more intensely moisturizing for winter since it's been sunny but dry. I put this on then slathered on aquaphor, and I woke up so glowy!! Love love. I hope to be using this in the summer on its own. * I've been using this product consistently for four months, yes its hydrating. But thats just it. It doesnt do much for me, I wish it did more for my skin but yeah, just meh! * This provides deep moisture without feeling too thick or oily. A godsend for my skin barrier * I absolutely adore this brand. I purchased the redness relief calming cream in the past and adored it but wanted something lighter as I have combination skin and this is perfect. Its a soft light moisturizer that doesnt leave me greasy or oily. Its also a fantastic moistuizing base for makeup, will certainly be repurchasing! * I've been on the hunt for a light, hydrating moisturizer since my favorite brand was discontinued, and this one ticks all my boxes. It applies smooth, absorbs fast and leaves my skin soft and happy. I do wish they had a light scent option. * this was one of my favorite moisturizers but it seems to have been reformulated. it's a lot more runny than I remember. I'm assuming it has a lot more water than the last time I've used it, which is annoying enough but it's really hard to apply now because it immediately starts running off of my fingertip"
126,the ordinary,natural moisturizing factors + beta glucan,pimprod2039174,2609860," * After purchasing this moisturizer for a second time, its a hard no. I knew it was more for oily skin so I bought the squalene oil (which is amazing!!!) to help. However after 20 minutes the moisturizer was piling from my skin. I tried using it without my other skin care products but it wss still piling. I loved how it made my skin look and feel but I couldnt wear it at all. * This product has been the ULTIMATE GAME CHANGER for my skin. I have ALWAYS had rough, dry, sensitive skin on my cheeks, with barely a little oil in my T zone. I would also get sebaceous filaments in the T zone (probably because my skin is always super super dry). 

I have tried EVERYTHING to fix this. I thought I wasn't exfoliating enough, or perhaps I simply needed to add more oil products. Everything I tried only made it worse. Then I saw this product and thought maybe what I really needed was a different tactic. Maybe instead of oil based products, I should try doing the opposite. So I grabbed this. 

Within two weeks, the red areas of my skin lightened up - I have had red blotches my entire life so right away, I know somethings up. The sebaceous filaments stopped coming back as fast. My skin stopped being so rough in texture, turning soft and smooth. I stopped needing foundation. No breakouts, nothing. My skin is practically glowing. It's also bouncier???!!

TOTAL GAME CHANGER!

I gotta say though, I was surprised because it acts like a mask more than a moisturizer but I ultimately decided to trust the process. I apply it in the morning, and unlike the oils, it doesnt get absorbed by my skin, or simply get wiped off throughout the day. So if you're expecting it to feel and act like a typical cream, you might be confused when this simply seems to dry on your face. Like I said, it's more of a mask, locking in the moisture, keeping your skin hydrated all day long. 

I put it on in the morning before I leave the house, then again right after cleansing at night before bed. I LOVE that it doesn't wipe off onto my pillow while I'm sleeping. I love that I can simply apply makeup right on top of it with zero issues and it still stays. It has even helped my under-eye area??? 

This stuff is crazy good. I wanted to know what the magic is so I looked up beta-glucan skin benefits and yup, it forms a protective barrier, increases collagen, is anti-inflammatory, and its anti-microbial. I really dont know how this one isnt a cult fave yet. 

I purchased this in store after looking at it here in the app. * I have dry skin and I love this. I use it in place of an essence. I always follow with a heavier moisturizer. Nothing can beat the beta glucan amount found in this moisturizer. * This is a GEL not a cream moisturizer. I missed that word on the package when I purchased it, haha. I have dry, sensitive, and cystic acne, definitely not for my skin. I have developed small sebaceous pimples all over my face over 1 & 1/2 weeks of use. HOWEVER, I do love the other moisturizers from The Ordinary. * it feels like i put a purposefully drying product all over my face. my skin is tight, dry, and sticky for hours after using. i thought at first i was using too much, but it feels the same no matter how much or little i use. * My local store was out of Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA so I decided to try this one. Firstly, it's a gel and not a cream and that should have been my first clue. It applied it and while it went on smooth, that was not the ending result. My face feels like I'm wearing a mask of sorts and my skin does not feel hydrated at all. It feels like a dry cast and during these often dry fall/winter months this is NOT what I need for my skin. 0/10 would not recommend. * works well for my combo skin in the summer.  makes my skin look healthy and hydrated and not oily which i love. the only con is that it is a little sticky on the face, but it's not super bothersome."

I didn't buy this but it was given by my mom because she has oily skin and she felt like this did nothing. When she said I could have it I tried it out and at first I thought she was crazy because it was hydrating. Overtime it lost it's moisture and became very dry. I haven't seen any improvements to this and this is really the only moisturizer I have been using. I felt like over time it made my skin flakey, clogged, and dry. Disappointed, however, the packaging is very nice and the texture of the moisturizer is nice. But I felt like it did nothing. * I've never used ELF products before and was recommended this as a replacement for my First Aid Beauty coconut water moisturizer and was pleasantly suprised! I like the texture and the light scent. I feel like it has kept my skin balanced and not caused more acne and for 1/3 of the price, I love that! * I like this cream. Lightweight yet very moisturizing. * Don't be fooled by the jelly texture of this moisturizer. It looks the part but once applied dries up insanely quick. I do not have dehydrated skin where moisturizer should be sucked into my skin that fast. I am returning asap! * This does not hydrate the skin AT ALL! It leaves a weird feeling film on your face, and after using your hands and face feel dry istead of moisturized. I would not recommend and definitely not worth your money. * Made my skin super dry! Idk how thats even possible! * Made my skin super dry! Idk how thats even possible!"
128,byoma,moisturizing gel cream spf30,pimprod2039807,2611682," * I have combination skin and have tried SO many sunscreens. They never work because they either don't rub in well, pill, or have a white cast. Not this one! It blends perfectly, wears well with makeup, and feels moisturizing! Can't recommend this enough * Its a great moisturizer that spreads evenly and blends in well, leaving a great glow on the face. BUT once makeup goes over top, it pills soooo badly. I've trued changing foundations and skin prep and it is the same result every time. * This SPF is one of my favs and I always get compliments on my skin being glowy when I wear it! 10/10 recommend. Didn't break me out either! * Not that I had irritation after this, but for my skin gel moisturizers work better, this one was heavy on the cream. I don't remember what my skincare was like back when I used this moisturizer at the end of my routine, but I just felt like it was taking forever to rub in and not really moisturizing my face. Personally felt more like a lotion than a gel cream. If this one doesn't work for you either I'd suggest Byoma's other product, the pink gel moisturizer is what I kept using after this one. * I wanted to like this. Seemed good cause its a light gel moisturizer and goes on nice.  Liked that it has spf. But once it drys on your face it pills so bad. Just makes a mess especially of your layering makeup on too. Definitely would not recommend. * I wanted to love this but it pills sooooo bad!! * I have tried so many different brands of sunscreen. I have very senstive, acne prone, oily skin. This is the first sunscreen that hasnt caused me to break out, leave a white cast, or make my skin burn. And it feels so nice on your skin."

It has left my skin feeling absolutely amazing! Obsessed with this product. * I have not worn any Lancome products besides their glosses but tried this when I was inside of Ulta then walked around the store. Omg! What a difference. The redness in my cheeks and by the corners of my nose went away. And my skin looked immediately brighter. The feel of the creme itself is SO luxurious and you only need a little bit so it will last a longer time (of course we want that with this price lol) * I love this product and ordered it online for a mother's day gift. However, I somehow got a refill, so it came in a plastic container with a tear-away foil cover and no jar. I didn't even know refills existed for this. I didn't have a container to place it in (other than using a cheap Ziploc bag), so it would have dried out. Hence, I had to return it. I'm not sure if others have had this issue, but Ulta, please be aware! * Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo my mom is a dermatologist and she loves it!!!!!!!! * I have been using this cream for about a month and a half. It feels pleasant and smells beautiful, but does not live up to its claims in my experience. My face does not feel fully hydrated by the end of the day, never mind 24 hours. I have not witnessed brightening or firming. A big selling point (and likely excuse for the huge price tag) is the Grand Rose extract, which Lancôme does a poor job explaining the benefit of. Luckily I had Ulta points to use on this cream, and not my own money. I got roped into the illusion of grandeur and prestige with this Absolue cream. Don't be like me. Much more effective and affordable creams are available on the market. Research ingredients; rose extract offers unremarkable and lackluster benefits. Perhaps the Pro-Xylane and shea butter can, but certainly not in this formulation. * This product is amazing! Expensive as heck but amazing. I originally tried this as a sample and noticed a difference from just the sample. My skin has NEVER felt so soft and smooth! Make sure to purchase when there's a 20% off code otherwise it's a lot. * Most say ""it softens the skin""  Goodness ladies, you can ""soften skin"" with products that are free of chemicals and work to soften.. A cream at this ridiculous price should do more than ""SOFTEN"".. I received a teeny tiny sample of it .. Sorry I don't believe one can see any difference whatsoever with 4 drops of a cream with a strong perfume smell.  I have sensitive skin and perfume is not something I want in a cream"

I'm in my late 40's and this face cream really helped me to feel youthful again. I combine it with the tea tree serum. I feel perfectly hydrated without being weighed down. * Bought the full-size jar after receiving a sample. It's a nice weight without feeling heavy or greasy. Light, pleasant scent. I use it after washing my face at night. Provides ample moisture and skin smoothing and plumping overnight. * Hi Everyone!

So, I very rarely write reviews but this product deserves one. I've been using this product for a little over a week now and it's saved my skin. A little bit about me and my skin concerns: I'm 38, latina with tan skin, no wrinkles but a few fine lines around the corners of my lips. I struggle with eczema on my eyebrows, around my nose and chin. When I started using this cream, I had been dealing with a flare up that was into its 2nd week. 😫 I applied this the same night that I picked it up. Immediately, I noticed the lemony scent and silky feel on my skin. I had no stinging or burning. The next morning, MY FACE WAS CLEAR. No patches, no angry flare up. My skin was glowing and supple. It's been very hot in NJ and I've even used this twice a day with no adverse reaction. My skin looks so much better and that makes me happy. Thank you fresh for this amazing product. I love it. 🩷 * I really wanted to like this, as I tried the lotus day cream in the past and loved it! This time, I got this in the gift set from Ulta (the one you get with minimum purchase), and I am happy I didn't purchase the full size. The cream has a nice texture and smell but it made me break out terribly!!! I definitely wouldn't recommend to sensitive acne prone skin people. Very disappointing. * I have years using this cream. Ordered new one, when I applied it I did noticed the smell was different, I thought was expired. Looks like lots of customers are complaining about a formula changed ? So sad, now I have to find a replacement brand. * This became my new favorite lotion so quick! Super moisturizing but feels light still. Has the best smell ever (not too strong). Highly recommend! * i made the mistake of not doing a patch test. my face broke out from this really bad. it also has a weird strong fruity fragrance??"

I'm on my 4th bottle I like it that much!! * Recieved a sample and used on my seriously purging skin. It never irritating my sensitive skin and actually felt soothing. It took hours to ansorb into my skin and left a slightly greasy feel. I awoke this morning to very happy skin - hydrated, smooth, plump and slightly firmer. Once my current moisturizer is empty, I'll be purchasing. * This is my second time repurchasing. I hate the price but this has made a significant difference in my skin. I have sensitive dry skin and this has given my skin the moisture it needs and an amazing glow. I see others are complaining about it being ""greasy"" i havent had that issue. I apply two pumps to my skin and it gives me the most beautiful glow. I use everything Dermalogica and constantly get compliments on my skin. * This is one of those products that's been life changing in my routine. The way my under eyes look & feels from this product is phenomenal. This has helped with my fine lines and wrinkles. Helped firm my under eyes. Super rich lux formula. A little goes a long way.

It has this water-gel like consistency but its really smooth to apply without that greasy feeling. i love how this made my skin feel however I think the snail mucin isn't personally for me. Snail mucin can cause some people to get small bumps. I still use it sometimes but this product wasn't for me but I would still recommend trying it out! * this is hands down the best moisturizer for oily skin and has the best ingredients for skin care at the same time. this is so lightweight and feels GREAT. i think I've been thought 5 or 6 bottles of this and will continue. i used to use YTTP before this and i love this much more. it really helps soothe any breakouts and irritation during my period too * Snail mucin is my new go to ingredient and this is very smooth and creamy. It also reports good on the app YUKA. * This is a good price and it works for me very well. I barely have dry skin currently because of this product and normally I am very dry in the winter.  I will buy again. I am a 32 yr old woman * Okay, i have repurchased this mosturizer prob 2-3 times. I use maybe 2-3 pea size amounts once a day at night. Redness went down with this one more than it did with the redness releif product from peach slices, so i think my skin just needed a break. The bottle doesnt last very long (around 3 months which is quite short for me, as I am a student and dont want to spend $60 a year on mosturizer lol). My last 2 bottles I noticed that overtime, if there is a little bit of product left on the tip, the packaging will degrade and the cap wont be able to turn back on. The ridges where the cap is usually secured comes off, so there is not air tight seal. Other than that, i love the product, the packaging not so much. Due to this reason, i will be looking for a new mosturizer. If you really want to try it out though, I recommend storing it upside down and wiping the cap with a clean towel regularly. I dont like doing this though because i dont like to touch the applicators of my products. * I recently got this moisturizer more than a week ago at my local Ulta store.i wanted to try something new and more affordablle for me.A few days later i started having the worst breakouts ive had in a while and my skin has been drier and flaky.This is definitely  not for my combo/oilly acne prone skin.do your research before you by this. * I was looking around ulta in store for a moisturizer and an employee came to help and recommended this. I would recommend this brand in general due to the gold ingredients. It is a very good moisturizer to keep my acne in check."

Would not recommend for sensitive skin. * I'm 28 yrs old w/ extremely dry skin, and I'm just starting to see my 11's. I bought this moisturizer 2 weeks ago bc the packaging boasted anti-aging properties & hydration. This product did NOT add any hydration to my skin & it actually emphasized the the 11's I was trying to plump up. I was super disappointed & I'll most likely go back to the Biossance or Cosrx Snail Mucin moisturizers bc they actually work! * I love the texture and how moist the cream is on my clean * Product is great, but just not for me. I'm not sure if product is not a match with my toner or retinol but when applying it gives me a burn sensation and I look red but then it goes away. Product didn't work for me. It's probably a match for other type of skin but not with mine. * Definitely try a swatch of this product in store before you buy. I do not have sensitive skin but I reacted to this product within like a minute of trying it in Ulta. So glad I tried before I buyed. The texture of the product was nice though and smelled good so if your skin doesn't react I'm sure its a great product. * My makeup used to blend beautifully over this and feel so luxe.

I never write reviews but honestly the improvement in my skin's uneven tone/hyperpigmentation and fine lines- especially on my neck, have  improved considerably.

I've tried it with different serums and oils - no matter what combo I try, it pills terribly. Today, since I had no plans to leave the house, I decided to try it without any other product. You guessed it....it still pills, not as much as when it's combined, but annoyingly nonetheless. I'm quite disappointed. * I really tried liking this product, I've absolutely loved all my PTR products and never had a bad experience but the smell is extremely unpleasant and th product pills like crazy. I originally tried this as a face moisturizer under my Supergoop makeup primer and noticed the pilling and originally though it was a reaction between ingredients so I switched to using it at night and when I used my face oil on top I had the same problem with pilling. if I put any product on top of this moisturizer it always pills up and I have to try to wipe my face after application. I have used different moisturizers under my makeup primer and face oils and have never encountered this problem. Moisturizer is never my final step in my skin care routine morning or evening so it is extremely difficult to use and not have it pill up. I have to skip steps to be able to use this moisturizer and if the smell and texture/consistency blew me away I would consider it but it overall leavs me super disappointed. Will honestly just end up throwing out what I have not happy with the product at all, I can easily find much better results and moisturizers overall * I have very sensitive skin and have been trying to find a product that works for me for so long! I usually cant tolerate any actives/acids but because this is in a cream its working wonders for my skin. Its the perfect amount of moisture with exfoliation that has cleared my breakouts!!! * I was really excited to try this moisturizer because I really liked how it felt on my skin but if I pair it with any serums or other products this moisturizer peels. * Love this * Good cream.  Noticed a difference in the texture of my skin."

141,l'orÃ©al,revitalift triple power anti-aging moisturizer - fragrance free,pimprod2009091,2554031," * L'Oreal Paris Triple Power Face and Neck SPF 30 is a decent, affordable everyday moisturizer with SPF 30. It hydrates well and is readily available. However, it can feel heavy, has a noticeable fragrance, and doesn't produce dramatic anti-aging results. Best for normal to dry skin, it's a good option if you prioritize affordability and sun protection.  If you have oily or sensitive skin, or dislike fragrance, consider other options. * L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Face and Neck Moisturizer SPF 30 with Pro-Retinol, Vitamin C & Hyaluronic acid is perfectly packaged. With its thick moisturizing consistency I'd say it's a little thicker than anticipated and took some getting used to. Also, I'm an extremely sensitive skinned person that breaks out easily with some scents & comedogenic products. After several weeks of usage I did feel it smoothed my neck, however I did experience some breakouts on my face. I would probably use this product as more of a summertime SPF than a daily moisturizing cream. * 'LOreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer, Pro Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin C to Reduce Wrinkles, Firm & Brighten Skin really does what it claims and MORE! I use this in the morning after I wash my face, but before applying my foundation for the day. It's an integral part of my routine to also use this in the evening after I remove my makekup for the day, but before bed. This leaves my skin hydrated yet moisturized, but also acts as a solid base for my foundation making it not only stretch farther but also moisturizing my skin and helping with fine lines and wrinkles that come with aging. I LOVE the versatility of this product and its light scent. This is one of my most favorite staples and I highly recommend L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer, Pro Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin C to Reduce Wrinkles, Firm & Brighten Skin. Give it a try, I think you'll love it. * Don't be fooled by the little jar, this cream packs a lot of punch. One of the best things about it, is that it pulls double duty as a day cream with the SPF and night cream. Using it at night gives the skin that little bit of extra moisture needed for night time. I can definitely see a difference in my skin after using this for almost a month.  I was given this product in exchange for an honest review * Such a perfect day cream! I received this product about a month ago and have been consistently using it day and night. Even in the winter, I can go all day and night with my skin not only feeling baby smooth soft, and not greasy or shiny. When putting it on, I was struck by the thickness of the cream, yet it slides on easily and just melts into the skin. I am so happy it has spf 30, so I feel confident using it during the daytime. It doesn't roll on the skin, and also does not make my makeup slip off. I could barely smell a scent, and it just lifts up the face and gives it a nice, subtle glow. I also noticed a marked improvement in the texture on my neck. Love it!! * I received This free in exchange for my honest review. This one now replace my much more expensive lotion. It has wonderful ingredients and left my skin feeling so smooth. Blurred my lines and pores. I love the scent of this. I will definitely be repurchasing this. Works much better than the more expensive brand. * Goes on smooth and evenly. I've used this product every day since I received it. It helps moisturize my face, while lifting in just the right places."

This helped clear that up in about a week. My skin feels very hydrated and much happier. * Great moisturizer! * I have cancer and I get radiation treatments 5 days a week. By week 5 my underbelly was super bright red. It looked exactly like the time I sat in the sun all day every day for two weeks straight in Hawaii when I was 15 years old. Quite a nasty sunburn but this one didn't hurt. The nurses told me to use Aquaphor, but 3 days of Aquaphor did nothing at all, so I bought this hoping it would do something better than nothing. I slept with it overnight and the morning after it was half as red and looking really good. I now have a newfound respect for Oatmeal as an active ingredient. * I have been using this for years but since they changed the formula I developed a rash around my eyes and rashes on my face. I opened a new tube and within a few hours of using my skin burned and felt like tickling on my face. Definitely not for senitive skin!!! * I have been using this for years but since they changed the formula I developed a rash around my eyes and rashes on my face.

It's been 1 week and I already see and feel the changes in my skin. * I wish I would have bought multiples during the big sale. This cream is ideal as a night cream. It makes my skin soft, bright and plump. The consistency of this cream is also ideal for the neck area! This definitely my top 3 face creams. * I am almost 55 and this stuff is amazing. It pairs well with makeup and gives your skin a glow! I can't live without this product. Also, there is a definite noticable difference!!! I wish this was gifted- but this an honest opinion!! * I love this product and have been using it for years. It makes your skin feel so hydrated and it minimizes fine lines.  I am in my 60's and if I don't use this product I can definitely notice a difference.  This product was not gifted to me by strivectin though I wish it was. * Gifted by . From the moment I started using it, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin's hydration levels. The formula is incredibly nourishing and leaves my skin feeling soft, supple, and oh-so-hydrated. What's more, it doesn't just provide a temporary moisture boost – it actually helps to lock in hydration throughout the day, keeping my skin looking and feeling its best. * I used this moisturizer for fine lines on my face . It definitely helped fade it little bit . If I consistently use it , it should go away. 
It's also giving the healthy skin look . 
I received this moisturizer as complimentary from strivectin. * I'm eager to try this to tackle my stubborn wrinkles. I've already seen some smoothing on the edges and I'm excited to see more progress. Plus, the moisturizer is creamy and hydrating without feeling greasy. This was gifted by strivectin for me to provide my honest opinion!"
144,strivectin,super-c spf 30 vitamin c moisturizer,pimprod2022788,2574715," * I love how moisturizing this is but that where the good vibes stop. It smells like sunscreen and burns my eyes!  I use a separate eye cream so it shouldn't be getting into my eyes but some how it still does. I wish I could love it but I've found something less creamy that acts more like a primer and doesn't make my eyes burn and water all day 😢 * Makes my skin look beautiful! * And gave me a bad taste in my mouth. Going back to Mario Badescu. Not worth the extra sun protection. * This is a great one step. Works well for dry or combo skin. Love the texture. Its also THD Ascorbate. * nice * I am a redhead with freckles and sun/age spots. I bought this cream to use on ny face both for the SPF and to fade freckles. My skin had some sensitivity issues a couple weeks after I started using the product - redness, small blisters and peeling. It might've been this product, might not, but i still have not recovered. Waited too long to return it and so I started using on my neck and chest without issues. I wear a lot of V-neck tops, and noticed my freckles and dark spots faded surprisingly quickly! I'm not sure if I will buy it again, but it DOES work. On the downside it has an unpleasant citrus scent. Im not usually bothered by scents but I'm not fond of this one. * Left my skin greasy and shiny but did not moisturize my skin. Would not recommend to use, did not see any improvement in my skin just felt like putting oily sun screen on my face."

I do think it's moisturizing but it is not for sensitive skin. Another thing that bothers me, and this may be ultas fault.. but the size of the product is no where located on the product page.. i truly don't understand charging that much and not letting us know how much we are getting. Its borderline criminal in my opinion. * Bought this as a mini and then fell in love and bought a bigger one.  Very hydrating, wakenup with a dewy complexion. Will continue to buy * I have sensitive skin plus scent sensitivity.  This water cream saved my winter dry skin and did not bother either of my sensitivities.  A little goes a long way and feels light on the skin with a very light, fresh scent.  I have purchased this 3 times and intend to continue using it. * Absolutely love this product, its now been my main moisturizer for over a year! Its light, has a vague fresh scent, very moisturizing! I it think can work for most skin types. I have normal-combination skin. A good friend of mine has more oily skin and she loves this as well. * I got a sample of this from a family member and was obsessed!

This brand is my new go-to.  It is light, dewy, and does what i need it to do.  I also love the price. * I've used this moisturizer a few times. So far I'm liking it, it goes on smoothly and doesn't feel sticky. * I love the sleek, black packaging. However, I do not understand all the good reviews.  I have extremely oily skin, and this ""dewy"" cream made my skin very dry and tight every time I used it. I very much prefer the dewy skin cream from Tatcha. * Im almost done with it and can say that im disappointed it was not hydrating. I put a good amount too to make sure and nothing. I really liked the toner so i wanted to try the day cream but i honestly didnt like it. For the price you could spend the same or spend a little more and get a better product * I've tried many many moisturizers over the years ranging from $45-$200 and this one is my absolute favorite! It'll be the one i get from hear on out. Im 49 and in my llayer year have experienced dry skin. Which looks like old skin . But this moisturizer is so good my skin looks younger! * I recently had almost a chapped texture to my skin I'm not really sure why but this cream is so hydrating it took care of all the issues I was having. A little goes such a long way. I have pretty sensitive/combination skin. * Received a GWP sample from Ulta.

Opened to use and it has blooms of mold spores!

Yikes.

148,beautystat cosmetics,universal c skin refiner 20% vitamin c brightening serum,pimprod2030149,2592489," * overall, the texture is nice and light and it's definitely hydrating. however, it feels a little gritty at first, which is kinda weird. my eyelids also feel slightly itchy after applying, BUT they don't get red at all. it might be the vitamin c working? hopefully that goes away but if it doesn't I'll have to stop using because it's driving me nuts. 

I'm torn about it, but I'll keep using it for a couple more days because I've never seen a product like this before. the ingredients look clean to me (paula's choice ingredient checker) so I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about. the ingredients are actually pretty impressive! * This Universal C Eye Perfector purposes are wonderful and how easy it is to use is great as well! I especially love how little the amount needed is and how that stretches the bottle and makes it last longer! It being fragrance free is wonderful but I do not like and it is not good how many other unhealthy, toxic ingredients are in it, which makes it not safe to use. If it was made without any harmful ingredients, then it would be perfect and super helpful! * I received this complimentary in exchange for my honest review. If you're like me and you sometimes look like you've just pulled an all-nighter (even when you haven't), this little gem might just be your new best friend. First off, the texture is super smooth and creamy without feeling heavy. It glides on effortlessly, which is a huge plus when you're trying to pat something around your delicate eye area. No one wants to tug at their skin, right? Now, let's get to the star of the show: the Vitamin C! It's like a burst of sunshine for your under-eyes. I've noticed my dark circles looking a bit more manageable and my skin feeling brighter after consistent use. Plus, it has that lovely glow that makes you look more awake—definitely a win! * I received this complimentary in exchange for my honest review. This serum has a lovely, lightweight consistency that feels luxurious on the skin. It's not too thick or sticky, making it super easy to apply. A little goes a long way—just a few drops and it glides on effortlessly, leaving my skin feeling fresh and hydrated.
Now, the magic is in the results! After using it consistently for about a month, I'm thrilled to report that my skin looks brighter and more vibrant. Those dull patches? They've started to fade, and I can definitely see a more even complexion. Plus, the Vitamin C gives a nice boost to my skin, making it look more alive and less tired. Honestly, it feels like I've just stepped out of a spa every time I use it! * product came with deffective packaging. pump did not work. * Speaking about the consistency and texture of the product, I would say that it is a very pleasant product, moderately rich, but at the same time quite light. When taken out of the package, the care is in no hurry to spread over the skin and holds its shape
Despite this, once you start distributing the product, you immediately notice its incredible lightness.
This is an effective care that, working in tandem with your cream, helps the skin to transform. It becomes moisturized, smoothed, as if ""erasing"" fine wrinkles from the face. The product is quickly absorbed, which is also a big plus. It ""behaves"" perfectly with decorative cosmetics, so you can not be afraid to apply makeup on top, because nothing threatens its durability. * The premium texture delivers a burst of rich moisture upon contact, penetrating deeply into the skin, providing a powerful moisturizing and soothing effect with easy application, giving the skin elasticity from the inside. Effect: helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles on the skin. The serum is thick: when extracted, a drop of the product does not spread.
The serum is instantly absorbed after application, my skin simply ""drinks"" it up quickly. After application, a light, radiant finish remains on the skin. I am very happy to finally feel the radiant finish of healthy skin, which I also had"
149,avÃ¨ne,hydrance aqua gel,pimprod2020807,2577168," * This product is HEAVILY scented snd burned my sensitive skin. Its a no for me. * This moisturizer does hydrate but there's some pretty big cons. 
-Not for oily skin. Leaves the skin very oily a few hours after application.
- Not non comedogenic. Caused a lot of new breakouts.
- Fragrance is strong * I got this in a travel size in a gift set and was excited to use it on a long weekend trip. As soon as I opened the packaging, I was hit with the aggressive smell of this product and was transported back to my grandmother applying her heavily scented products in my youth. Since I had no other moisturizer with me, I used it and my combo acne prone skin informed me that I had offended it with the noxiously scented product. My skin was irritated and my husband, who has the worst sense of smell ever, could smell this product through a couple layers of product.

So needless to say, I do not recommend this product. * I had a bad experience with this cream. I have used this brand for many years because its products are made with high-quality ingredients, and it always tries to take care of the skin. But this cream, besides having a horrible and extremely strong smell, filled my face with pimples, made me look like a teenager, and dried out some areas of my face. It was a total disappointment. * loved the way it made my skin feel
but can't get past the strong fragrance * The texture of the cream is very light. I like how it applies smoothly on the skin. But it has a strong baby powder smell and it makes my skin look so greasy after a while. * Love this lightweight moisturizing gel cream. Also my husband always gives me compliments when he kisses my cheek because he loves the clean fresh scent of this cream."

I feel so much more confident as a 24 yo in my aging skin. Gentle and effective. Love avene products! Just the best * Let me start off saying I really DO like this! I have 36yo DRY skin and I was getting a little peeling and dry patches from my Rx Tret. once a week, but had zero irritation using this every night! It's a pretty thick cream consistency so not the easiest to spread on its own IMO. I like to use a serum before this Retrinal .5% to help it glide on the skin easier. One pump usually does it, but sometimes I add just a tiny bit more if I feel like I didn't get even coverage. It's definitely a long term product so don't expect immediate results. I DO wish Ulta carried the 1.0 version of this instead of just the .5%. * I just bought this product and I am loving it. I can't speak on results yet but as someone with oily/acne prone  skin, I feel like I finally found an anti-aging product that absorbs well and doesn't break me out. It may feel slightly ""heavy"" at first but it absorbs. Great for sensitive skin, as well! So happy I found this brand * I tried a couple of retinal creams, and had breakouts and/or burning. Having used many Avene products with great results, I took their skin quiz online, and this product was recommended. It is a great alternative to retinol, at a very low dosage so you can start to build use. I've had great success with it, and it is helping with fine lines around my eyes. I can use it every night with absolutely no irritation."

It did! I have sensitive skin, both oily and dry if that makes sense. This product goes on smoothly, blends in vs. typical sunscreens that never seem to soak into the skin. I will say I noticed a pretty strong scent of sunscreen when I first opened it. Now, just a few days later, I don't notice it at all. I love how this makes my skin feel hydrated but not oily.

My face started stinging and itching after the second use and it doesnt go on as smooth. * i loved this product for so long, but didnt realize that it what was breaking me out. i tried a different cleanser, added an exfoliater etc. NOTHING would get rid of the harsh bumps all over my face. not until i researched and found out it had safflower it in which (can) support fungal acne. i have dry, sensitive acneic skin so this may work for others but definitely not for me. very disappointed and wish i found out sooner. not even 3 days after stopping this product, my skin is clearing up. * I used to be a big fan of the Superscreen Daily Moisturizer, and although they kept the packaging the same, they changed the formula and the name to Superscreen Hydrating Daily Cream. I think brands should be more transparent about informing their customers that they're actually buying a different product than what they're used to. The consistency of the new cream is thicker and harder to spread, but what stands out the most to me is the smell: somewhere in between Play-Doh and generic baby sunscreen. My partner has sensitive skin around his eyes, and the old formula didn't cause him any burning, but the new one does. I wouldn't buy this again. * I bought this because it had avobenzone but no octocrylene (at the time). Great texture but I reacted badly to something in it.

Thanks for a great product. * The water cream made me break out. The gel works much better for me. I will go back to that formulation. * I like this cream it goes on smoothly. * The results I've noticed after 3 weeks of using this are truly amazing. My skin has never been this soft or smooth. I've also noticed the darkness under my eyes has drastically changed, which I was not expecting. This should be a staple in everyone's skin care routine especially in the winter months! * Tried this product because it was half the price of the one I usually use ( Peter Thomas Roth) This left a very greasy film on my face. * I had used what I now can call the old formula, and did like how my skin felt. I was recommended by my esti to try another brand, but it was just too expensive to continue so I decided to go back to the Neutrogena. Sadly, the formula has been changed, and it is not at all what I experienced previously. I am not experiencing the redness and irritation that others are reporting, but my skin is not moisturized and looks dry and lifeless. My search for a new product begins. * Horrible. This new formula is simply horrible. It dries out my skin, makes it irritated, and leaves a weird greasy film. It pills like crazy and makes my skin horrible. I miss the old formula! It was perfect and always made my skin feel plump and soft. I swtiched to a higher end brand which is working now how this old neutrogena formula used to.

I LOVE IT!!! It blends GREAT (especially for a product with SPF), isn't greasy, doesn't make my skin oily or shiny, has not caused a breakout, and I can see a clear difference in the moisture level of my skin in just a few days. Anti-aging creams normally make my skin totally freak out, but this one is all good, no bad. Really glad I happened upon it! * This contains Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene....FYI * I joke that this is my old lady face cream because it smells like a bouquet of roses. However, it really does give the skin a lifted appearance and tightened feel. The daytime version has some SPF and wears nice under makeup. I wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin because of the fragrance. Also, I noticed on very dry winter days the product does not have enough moisture for my skin * I received this as a sample size from Estee Lauder and I can't wait to buy a full size. This is why I love samples, It lets me fiind out what I love without spending a fortune first.  It has the faintest fragrance that is subtle but lovely. It goes on so smooth and is just pleasant to use. My only complaint is the price. Some of us would buy this brand more often if we weren't priced out of the market. This is why I gave it a four. Otherwise, a five all the way. * This smells like febreeze and it doesn't go away when you rub it in :( save your monies * I use this product daily.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.

For this price there must be something better out there! * I use this morning and night along with the face and eye serum (same brand) followed by sunscreen (only in the morning). I can truly say that this stuff along with the face and eye serum works. I used to have very dry skin, but not anymore. Also, the hormonal acne I get occasionally is under control. Lastly, the wrinkles are diminishing. Totally worth every penny. * I see smoother skin , brighter skin , less fine lines and an overall younger look * I do love this product, it's true to all things advertised - A little bit goes a long way as I purchased this a few months ago and still have more than half of it left. I did not want to write a review until I was certain I was satisfied based off of the huge expense...

Great for anti aging; thick and creamy but absorbs easily enough. The perfect nighttime cream for me!"
162,cocokind,resurrection polypeptide cream,pimprod2037614,2605570," * I'm not one to write a review unless I absolutely love a product.  Well I've now purchased this moisturizer at least 5 times, plus the revitalizing eye cream from this same line.  I have combo skin and I never break out from using these products.  I use them day and night.  I do use a facial mist first during the day, then a serum (usually hyaluronic acid or matrixyl), then apply this moisturizer followed by a primer (primer if I'm in fact going to wear makeup).  I'm 52 and my skin stays so well hydrated throughout the day.  It's true as some of the other reviews have stated, the consistency can get a bit weird at times with the various jars, but don't let it fool you, the product works great, regardless.  I gave my Mom a set of the moisturizer and eye cream this past Christmas (she is 71), and she even re-purchased the moisturizer already and loves it as well.  I'm really hoping they never change the formula, as this has been my best skincare find.  I also wear contacts and their eye cream also never bothers my eyes, which is rare for me to find a product that doesn't irritate them at times.  So I just totally recommend trying these products, and sticking with them. * This cream is thiccc but thats just how i need it. I'm acne prone, have super sensitive dry skin and im already on my second bottle. It has a paste consistency but a little goes a long way and youre able to smooth it out easily. Using mine morning and night lasted me over 90 days, which to me is worth the price amd then some. * My skin is super dry and has some redness. This product definitely helps my skin with both. It does not weigh my skin down at all. I will definitely be purchasing this again!! * When I first opened it, I was disappointed by the glue like texture and smell. This literally smells like the elmers liquid glue used for crafts in elementary schools. However, I tried it as a night cream for a couple nights and got great results. It didn't irritate my sensitive skin and even helped calm the reddness I get on my cheeks. It meets the balanced of being a thick winter moisturizer without quite being heavy enough to clog pores—least this is my experience as someone with dry skin. It worth trying if you have try skin and need an affordable moisturizer. There are still better option on the market if you are willing to spend more money but this is a great value. * Amazing for my dry skin. With all the products out there it can be rare to find something that has such an immediate effect. The consistency is WEIRD but it truly absorbs super fast. My skin is hydrated and just seems to have a subtle glow. I do recommend having a somewhat consistent cleansing and exfoliation routine w this to help the product really sink in and not trap dead skin. Right now I only use it as an overnight moisturizer but it has been okay under make up if you give it real time to settle in and ""dry down"" 

I will be repurchasing! * I originally got this as a night cream because it's marketed as a heavier moisturizer, but it just didn't cut it overnight for me living in the desert with dry skin. It'll probably be great for people with oily or normal skin overnight. I made this my day moisturizer and it's lovely! Moisturizing without being greasy and my skin tolerates it well. This will be my winter day time moisturizer moving forward. * Because this is advertised as a heavier, winter cream I really thought it would be greasy on my skin. I was so wrong! It does feel a little thick but it rubs in well and absorbs better than any cream I have ever used. I have oily skin and that has even improved a bit. This is my new favorite face cream for daytime use. I will absolutely buy it again."

And then I have bumps all of my cheeks, and I felt like my pores were clogged very bag. So I threw the shelf in the trash and then I went to go use my regular soap, which is turmeric soap, but my turmeric soap doesn't really help. But yeah thats all. I do not recommend this product for people with oily skin type because I just feel like this is the worst product I have ever used in my whole skin care routine. Thanks. * I used this product last year in november & the first day i used it, it left my skin feeling dry & itchy. I do not recommen this product at all for oily skin faces. Its really hard trying to find something natural & good for oily skin type. * This gentle yet powerful facewash is the face wash I recommend for dry sensitive skin. * I've used this cleanser for the past five and a half years at the suggestion of my dermatologist.  It's really great for my skin.  At 68, my skin was still breaking out from time to time.  She explained how drying the other cleanser was and how hydrating this one was.  She was correct!  My skin looks fabulous!  No breakouts, no redness, no peeling. * I had tried this profuct before and it broke me out… i didnt want to judge so quickly so i waited a couple of years to test it out and same thing it broke me out… depneding on your skin type it may or may not work for you * It is a good size for traveling. * I have been using this facial cleanser for quite a few years and have no intention of stopping. It never dries my skin out and lathers enough to leave my face feeling clean and refreshed. I just turned my husband on to this, too, because he ran out of his facial cleanser and told me that bar soap was making his face feel too tight and dry."

Incredible all-around. * I did a ton of research snd was super excited to try this eye cream. I have very dark circles around my eyes and I was thinking this product would help with that. Unfortunately when i put it on, it makes the skin around my eyes buuuurrrrn. My eyes also arent that much more moisturized for such a thick cream. If you have sensetive skin, dont buy, its burns and is too expensive to try.

Only a small amount goes a long way * I am in love with this line, specifically this face cream and the eye cream. I have gone through two jars so far. I also use it on my neck and have noticed more of a difference there than on my face regarding tightening of skin. The cream is fairly light on the skin and is deeply hydrating. I ran out for a week and noticed an immediate difference! It can be a little shiny when combined with sunscreen and makeup however at night it just makes my skin glow. I am 48 and starting to battle some hormonal acne around my chin and mouth area so I have to avoid putting the cream around those areas. If I cant help myself (because it feels so good) I just get a few microscopic whiteheads that go away by the next day. * I love this cream. It feels so smooth. Going on. Has a beautiful texture. I noticed my skin is very vibrant after I use it."

Have used it a couple years now.  Non-reactive on my sensitive skin and feels wonderful on.  I believe it has made a difference in the texture of my skin and improved my neck wrinkles. * Finding the right skin care routine is never linear since it varies person per person. I have sensitive combination skin and I always struggled to find a product that didnt give me that greasy glow. 

This product is light yet hydrating enough that it doesnt require a lot of product. While the price tad is high, the big container last me 2-3 months depending on the weather. 

I would recommend you get a sampler size and try it out for 3 months because you wont see any instant results. After 6 months of using this product, it cleared my blackhead and slowly seeing results in other areas. * I have been using this multi corrective face cream since its arrived on the market, Im 52, it has been a game changer since i traded up from their daily moisturizer( in which i stared at 30. It doing what it needs to do, im not getting wrinkles or dry skin and i use it alone & under make up. I'm often asked if im 35 so i have to give some credit to kehls for it. I love the line, its fine quality and i will never waver! * I bought this after many great reviews. I used it around 10 times and thought it was sunburn because I was red and sore. I switched to e45 then another brand and I was fine. I then tried it again after a couple of weeks and it stung my face again! I usually don't have sensitive skin and I'm gutted I spent so much and now can't use it * Every single thing on my face 'balls up' when I use this moisturizer, including when I use it alone.  It does not absorb into my skin, but just sits on top. I've tried it in so many combinations and it's just incompatible with other skin care and foundations (I've tried several foundations -high end & low end- with same results).  I've also tried using it with serums, different primers, different sunscreens and alone with the same result. This is a hard pass for me."

I live in a high humidity area and it works great! * After applying other serums or makeup this product began to peel off my skin. * I have cystic and acne and everytning makes me break out but this didn't. I wouldn't say it helped my acne any, but i didn't break out bad and that's what i'm looking for :) the pump is awful though, barely works, wish it came in a different container. * i love this product but most of the bottle is air and only filled around halfway with the product. it is a wonderful product to help ease your acne but you definitely need to be willing to pay a lot for it and the select amount that you will get from the bottle * After two or three uses my entire face became red where I had applied it. Cannot figure out which ingredient i would be allergic to. Put Cortizone and neosporin all over my face to calm it down. * Just seemed it wasn't worth the money. It didn't last all that long.

It makes me look so pale. I am so surprised given the price and the fact it is supposed to be a ""daily moisturizer."" Would not waste your money. * I loved the fact that it had hyaluronic acid and SPF in one, but after putting it on, I realize it's definitely not for me. I hoped the reviews were wrong, but it definitely leaves a white cast over your skin, and made me look super pale, despite the fact that I have a fair, medium skin tone. * I have tried almost every mineral sunscreen under the sun. I'm fair skin, freckles, burn easily, break out easily and this sunscreen moisturizer has been amazing. There is a white cast initially but I rub the product between my fingers before applying and it blends within 5 minutes! I never get sunburn on my face while wearing this.

It's very, very light, so it doesn't turn into an oily mess, but it's moisturizing enough so that my skin doesnt feel tight/dry after application. I love it. And to top it off, it's not too expensive. The search for a good moisturizer is over. God bless. * I like this product. Very good moisturizing for my skin. Doesn't cause break outs. It's a little sticky, but if you plan to put a product over it, it is not at all noticeable. Barely noticeable anyways, just worth mentioning. * This is such an amazing product!  I only make enough to buy the smaller size, but even that small size will last me almost a month, because it only takes a small amount to go over my whole face every night. * I have sensitive, combination, and acne prone skin. I have been using this moisturizer for the past 6 years and noticed a significate improvement in my skins overall health a few months into using this product. I love that it is fragrance free as well. * The original Neutrogena water gel mositruizer didn't work for me because of the fragrance. I'm very happy to see this mositurizer in a fragrance free version! This is a great moisturizer  for oily, sensitive skin. Its provides great hydration and is lightweight, non-irritating, non-comedogenic, and affordable. The new glass jar is a nice touch to make the product feel a bit more elevated. * I used the water gel for years, because it was the only affordable moisturizer I could find that didn't make me break out. I have combination skin. Now with the new formula, I am breaking out like crazy. I will not buy this again.

Nothing compares. * I have combination skin. This did not break me out. I love how the texture changes once you start to rub it in. However, i wish it absorbed into the skin more completely. My skin feels tacky after using this, so my hair sticks to it. Oversll good tho! * This was recommended by a black dermatologist over a year ago.  I use it in combination with the vit C serum, any Vit C serum will work.  I absolutely LOVE the way this both looks and FEELS on my skin.  It works great with my various varieties of sunscreen, and I've never loved how great my skin looks so much. HIGHLY RECOMMEND * So far I love this product. Gives my face a fresh glow and moisture during this cold weather. I'm not sure if it would be great in the summer. The only issue is that you must dry your skin thoroughly. For some odd reason the texture of the cream changes if there's a hint of water on the skin. * I have very dry skin, and have tried and used over 50 face moisturizers, and this is one of the worst ones. It is SO thick and does not sink into the skin, it feels like its just sitting on top of your skin almost like sunscreen. I REALLY wanted to give it a fair try so I tried it as an overnight moisturizer, and when I woke up my skin did not feel moisturized. * I wanted to try this because it's made with clean ingredients, and ended up being disappointed by it. It left my face feeling oily in some places, and sticky all over. * I absolutely adore this moisturizer! I started using it a year or two ago and I've gone through multiple jars. It's lightweight and the texture is amazing. Starts off as a cream but then it disperses and feels like water on your skin. It leaves your skin so hydrated and dewy looking!"

My skin is extremely sensitive and i also have a bit of rosacea.  Texture is a bit thick but it doesnt leave resedue like others mentioned and it does mouturize the skin well.  

It covers my redness as if im using a bit of foundation so thats also a huge plus, totally recommend!! * It broke my face out real bad.  Carrying it back. * Broke my skin out so bad, chalky trash in 2 weeks it ruined my skin. * Love the idea of the green pigment to cover redness but while applying this product it seems to leave a white film behind - similar to what looks like dry flaky skin. Multiple comments have said the same thing but also mentioned the discontinued formula that seemed to work for them & that they loved, which unfortunelty I have never tried but would love to. I believe the product shouldnt be as much as it costs, for what little it does. I see the idea of what it should be but the formula could be better. That leaves me to say, in regards to the old formula, if its not broke - why fix it??? * This product isn't moisturizing at all. It sits on top of my skin and does little to hide the redness. Would love the old serum. * I started using this product during a hard phase of my rosacea. At first it helped reducing the redness on my face and also helped me with the itching. However, after some days my rosacea went worse, so I dedided to stop using this product which actually made my rosacea to start going better.
I noticed that everytime I tried the product again, the roseacea would reactivate.

I know it has worked for others but my experience was not good. If you have sensitive skin, I dont recommend you this product. * Started working 15 mins after I applied it.  Next morning almost all of the redness gone.  Have a little more clearing up of the bumps but nothing works in a day.  Def recommend."

My skin is hydrated. * product smells awful!!! * Tried this moisturizer because i love the cleanser, but its the total opposite. Unlike the cleanser which is light, smells great and leaves skin feeling fresh, this moisturizer is thick, feels heavy on your face, and smells like artificial fruit. Also, the pump is terrible. * This moisturizer is absolutely amazing! My face is so soft and hydrated, I couldn't believe it. The smell is light and fruity. I'm so happy I gave it a try. * Though I do love the way this lotion feels on my skin, I won't purchase this again unless the packaging changes. It feels cheap and only works about 2/3 of the time.

I do wish there was a way to open it at the end to get the remaining product that the pump won't squeeze out though.. otherwise 5/5 fully recommend. I even love the scent as it has a hint of the suncreen smell but not too much. * The sunscreen itself is wonderful, but I feel like they really did a great job on the packaging. For some reason it feels more sanitary to use than dipping your fingers in (even though I do wash my hands between applying products). 

Anyway, I can wear this sunscreen alone. Makes my skin glow so I feel comfortable skipping foundation 😌 * This is my first time working with an spf moisturizer, and honestly I think it does fine. I have oily + acne prone skin so moisturizers are a hit or miss, my only problem with this is that it does take a bit longer to absorb than I would like, but once it sinks in it's perfectly fine. * This is my first time trying these products. I was looking for a sunscreen that would not burn my sensitive skin or my eyes.

This could be an issue for people who have sensitive skin. I have to say that other than being a possible irritant or allergy to some, this moisturizer is a really great consistency and lives up to all the expectations that it claims to have. As with any product that is new to your skin, proceed with caution and do a patch test. Its worth knowing :) * I love the toner and serum in this line but for whatever reason this lotion is just waaay too much for me. It would irritate my exzema and cause small/minor breakouts.

For the past couple of years, my skin had been declining rapidly. In just two days, it had improved so much that I no longer have a single dry patch on my face, chin, or around my nose. There's no redness either. After a full week of using it, my skin looks better than it has in five years. I've tried everything, including every facial and medical-grade product, but this is the only thing that works. I haven't tested it under makeup, and I only use it at night. * A little goes a long way! I had to trust that I didn't need to soak my skin in this to feel results. I'm just so used to cheaper products that you need a good dollop of. Before this cream I used to have painfully dry skin around my mouth and down the sides of my chin. This fall and winter I was able to avoid that all together with daily applications. Also the jar is kinda huge. I bought another jar about 2 months too early because I thought I had reached the bottom of my first jar. * Very hydrating and gentle formula. Your skin will have a health glow. * I have dry skin with psoriasis. No fragrance, feels luxurious, and keeps my skin really hydrated throughout the day.  I love how it doesnt irritate my skin even when my psoriasis is flaring up. If you have dry skin, I definitely would recommend this. If you have oily skin, I have a feeling this might feel too heavy for you. * I like how my face feels after using this. * I use this face cream as just an extra boost from my day today I use that about every 2 to 3 days just to get my skin a little more Moisture especially when it's cold, weather or dry weather * It takes a while to settle into the skin and peels under make up. Its just an ok cream. I dint think its eorth it for the price."
181,mac,hyper real skincanvas balm moisturizing cream,pimprod2037107,2605398," * I really like this moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. I have dry skin that gets worse in the winter, but by day three, I noticed a significant improvement and felt much less dryness. * I love this moisturizer. I use it daily as my skin prep before makeup. It keeps my skin so hydrated under foundation!! * This is perfect to moisturize the skin before applying makeup. Leaves your skin glowing and hydrated before foundation * This is the key to flawless makeup! I've used countless moisturizers and primers, and have never been quite happy with how my makeup blended on top. I wish I would have tried this sooner, but it was worth the wait. I have combo skin, and this is so smooth and hydrating, but not heavy or greasy. The smoothness is what makes me love how my foundation blends on top. I like a matte finish foundation, but they tend to be too drying and look dry on my skin. Not anymore! I get the smoothest, most plush looking effect from this moisturizer and my makeup looks better than ever! I highly recommend this! * True to explain, stays on, I see the difference in my skin. * I have noticed a HUGE difference in fine lines! Im 29 and constantly asked if im 22! * Used this product for 4 days, my entire face and neck broke out in a rash. I do not recommend this product to anyone that has sensitive skin."
182,origins,ginzing energizing gel cream with caffeine + niacinamide,pimprod2033869,2598935," * Brightens & moisturizes well without being oily. I pair this with Origins ginzing spf 30 and origins gizing refreshing eye cream. I've been using this combo since 2023 through two pregnancies and already acne prone skin. It keeps breakouts at bay while brightening my skin. NO PILLING. :) * So clean and light, it absorbs so well without fully disappearing. Leaves skin feeling clean and not greasy . * Probably one of the beat skincare products I've ever used. Wish I could afford to keep it in stock. * This eye gel is part of my every day beauty routine. A little goes a long way. It's very soothing and moisturizing. It does not settle in pores and it does not pill. I use it before I put on my tinted moisturizer. * Refreshing light citrus scent, cool on the skin, moisturizes without feeling heavy or greasy. * I was looking for cheaper dupe to the 100hr moisture surge from clinique and this was the only other moisturizer that has caffine in it. But the smell was too strong. Says theres essential oil inside but i never break out but i did. Go pay the extra 10 or get moisturizer surge. Also blackfriday and other holidays it goes on sale * I received a sample of this product in a big sample kit and decided to try it out. I had been using The Ordinary Niacinamide + Zinc for the longest time and after trying out the sample there is no going back for me. I had no idea but The Ordinary was causing breakouts which cleared up in a matter of days once switching to this. It makes my skin feel refreshed almost immediately and my skin looks brighter and plumper after just 30 minutes. Normally heavily fragrant products make me break out and cause my face to burn due to my sensitive skin but I have not had this issue at all with this product. It is a refreshing citrus smell which I absolutely LOVE the smell of citrus. After long time use my skin consistently looked brighter and I had less dry skin and fine lines. It is true that it does leave your skin feeling sticky but I always put my moisturizer on top of it and the stickiness is no longer an issue. I highly recommend this product!!"
183,peach & lily,rescue party barrier comfort cream,pimprod2042702,2617478," * Works incredibly well. My skin hasnt been clearer. * I love this brand and use multiple products by them. This one, however, caused a skin reaction the morning after I used it :( * I love this moisturizer. I'm about to run out after using this every morning and night for 2 months straight and I cant get enough of it. I noticed people were saying it had a really strong smell, but it's not really that strong to me and it's not that bad at all. I kind of like it to be completely honest. I would recommend the rescue party barrier restore serum before it too if your skin is still dry. I have dry cheeks from rosacea and a very oily and porous nose but this and a lot of their other products still work extremely well on my whole face. * I got this as a sample and had to get a full size. This helps the eczema on my forehead soooo much. If you are used to unscented products, you will not mind the smell at all. So happy I found this and Peach and Lily! * I bought this in combination with the relief serum to see if it will help with my mild redness. I am not seeing much difference after about six weeks. I also feel like my skin is even dryer than when I started. I will try out their hydration specific products instead to see if I can get the desired results. I also can't belive how small the package is for the price. I almost thought it was travel size. * I dont mind smell but this smells like cardboard and STRONG! * I have super reactive, sensitive skin. I was having a flare up from something and was getting desperate. I came across this moisturizer online when I remembered that I had a sample of this from a previous order. I figured my face is already freaking out so if it doesn't work it won't be much worse.. The sample is small but even after using just a little bit I could tell my face was starting to calm down. By the end of the day, I had ordered the full size and another P&L product lol. I don't know if I will use this everyday or just when my skin is freaking out on me but I am so grateful for this product! Anything that helps me get my face to calm down is a winner in my book. I am absolutely miserable when I get those flare-ups and in about 24 hours I am feeling much more comfortable and normal. Hopefully this continues to be a winning product for me. Oh and yes, there is a play doughy smell but it is not bad at all! It goes away very quickly. Frankly, if you care about the smell I don't think your skin needs this enough. I'd slather my face in dead fish to get my face to feel better when it's reactive and angry if that were the solution lol."
184,osea,atmosphere protection cream,pimprod2017698,2570072," * Gives me HORRIBLE acne. Im not very acne prone but everytime I use this my face will breakout in unusual places for the next few days. * ive been using this since january 2024 & i love it so much! i got a free sample of the atmosphere cream and it def made me want the larger size. For referance i used to use the neutrogena hydroboost moisturizer haha this stuff is 10x better. Although it is a bit pricey I think its totally worth it. My skin glows like no other! I dont wear makeup so its important for my skin to be on 10 at all times. I also have combo skin and it doesnt make me feel oily or anything. Lastly, I bought the bottle at the beginning of April and its now Sept and ill probably buy another by the end of this month.. so the money goes a long way!! * I enjoyed using the product, the packaging is really good. It has a really nice smell without being strong. The only thing I don't like is that it's a bit pricey for the quantity. * They changed the formula and the smell is completely different. I used to love this product because it smelled like a spa. The new formula also does not feel as rich on the skin. This will be my last bottle. Too pricey and it is near impossible to get the last 1/4 of the product out of the jar, * I purchased this cream and overnight cream for my face along with the body lotion ..WELL
They all smell the same overnight and Day facial cream is the same to me 
I spent over $100.00 on two facial products are the same .
won't buy it again * Lightweight, smells great and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. * Ok seriously Ive tried thousands of products over the yeara because i have sensitive ans acne prone skin! Ive been using this every day sometimes twice a day if i rememebr and its kept my skin CLEAR!! Even with the return of rhe mask mandate at work its protected my skin from my ""maskne"" ive had theoughout the pandemic. Would definetlt recomend this. This trial ive used this alone for about a month and a half."

I threw it away. * This is my favorite cream. I have dry skin that occasionally (monthly)breaks out. This makes my skin feel so nice and my foundation goes on like a dream! I love the light scent as well. 10 out of 10! * Lighter than extra firming but felt sticky when used after toning. Heavy fragrance not good for sensitive skin flared my rosacea. Did make my dry skin soft but returning this one, * I love the fragrance.  I did t find it overwhelming.  I also like how quickly absorbs into the skin and doesn't have yhat greasy feel after on the tace.  I typically layer this with serums.  I tried it in the colder dry months and makes my skin feel  hydrated. * I had been use this product over 20 years 
It worked very good on my skin. * This is marketed for normal-dry skin but I have combo-oily and my skin drinks this! Also not marketed for my age range (20s), but if you're looking to splurge, this is it! I bought it on a whim as a Beauty Steal and I would absolutely buy it again. It's super hydrating but lightweight, not greasy, great for sensitive skin, and leaves me with a healthy glow! This moisturizer has helped to smooth my skin especially as I'm dealing with breakouts - gives me better glass skin than some Asian beauty products that claim to do so. Love love love! * A light moisturizer that delivers maximum hydration.  I have always had good results from Clarins products."
186,peter thomas roth,firmx collagen moisturizer,pimprod2014564,2561084," * Im really surprised by the negative reviews. I got a sample of this cream ans love how my skin feels ans looks when i use it. The price is exorbitant and is the only thing keeping me from making it my usual night cream (i work in retail so it takea half a shift to pay for it). I'll jusy have to watch for sales! * I bought the collagen cream to replace collagen masks. I am very pleased with the results after just a few days. After cleansing and toning, I massage a small amount into my skin. I allow it to dry completly and then use Philosohy Miracle Worker face cream over top of it. This gives me smooth, glass skin all day. My skin texture has markedly improved since adding the collagen cream. It is key to properly massage the collagen cream in and letting it dry before adding the second cream. I do not wear makeup, so I cannot speak to how it would layer. * I was really excited to try this and after a few weeks notice no results. * Leaves my skin soft. Will repurchase * I blend this with the  prayer Thomas water drench sheet tint moisturizer. Blends great! Firms my skin and doesn't feel greasy or heavy.  I use this as a foundation.  Quite  expensive for the combo… but it works great with make up or just as a tinted moisturizer with mascara. * This is a great product and feels good on my skin, but I can't use it like other moisture products before applying my foundation because of pilling.. I now use only at night so I'm not putting anything over it. * I like it. I also drink collagen supplements so i think it works pretty well on top if it. Im only 23 so i dont have wrinkles to begin with but i will say that its pretty sticky going on and if you touch your face while its trying to dry than you will get the 'beads' like everyone else is saying but if you dont touch your face until its fully dry it will look normal"

Wish they'd reformulate it so I could go back to using it again. * I personally wasn't a fan of this product. First I want to point out the sales associates at Ulta are super sexist to men and I got passed multiple times every time I asked for help literally ignored me. But back to this product, it's very similar to sun screen I prefer a thicker face lotion like the 2-1 face & beard but that got discontinued. * After years of using Vasaline Intensive Care lotion on his face, I convinced him to try the Clinique For Men Broad Spectrum SPF21 Moisturizer.  He loved it!  For a lotion with sun scree, it's not greasy and  it absorbs into the skin nicely leaving no residue. * If you've ever had a reaction to a sunscreen this one probably contains your culprit. Wore once and broke out in a rash/hives where it was applied. I will now be avoiding oxybenzone. * Applied it at the store to test it out and also bought some, a few hours later had a giant bump on my chin. Going to rerun it tomorrow. * This is the only product my husband doesn't seem to have a skin reaction to. He has oily, sensitive skin. * My husband, who usually hates skin care products, is obsessed with this Clinique moisturizer. I paired this one with the anti-age moisturizer in the Clinique line and he's noticed a huge difference in his skin tone."

My skin looks juicy and healthy. My dark spots are fading and my pores are gone. Im in my 30's and this is an absolute yes! So rich and creamy! Its a treat for my skin * I recently tried out a vitamin C serum and unfortunately it was too strong. My skin became so dehyrdated, nothing was absorbing, everything burned. It was awful! I knew I needed something gentle yet could repair my skin barrier. I bought this and LRP's cica gel. Wow! My skin was back to normal and actually better within a week. Way quicker than I anticipated, given everywhere I read said it could take up to 3-4 weeks. This will forever live on my shelf, and I'll probably purchase the large bottle to use on my body once I finish up my current body lotion.  Thank you, thank you, thank you La Roche Posay! * Horrible. Make me break out so bad and get itchy and red with hives. Luckily it went away within the school day but would never recommend this. Tried a ""clean"" brand never again * This cream is the best for my stand mature skin. I use this in my face. * I have buy so many bottles of this product it just perfect for my skin type. It last all day and i dont even feel i need to reapply at all. The only negative i have to say its that eventually when its like 3/4 empty the product stop coming out and how is so thick its hard to take out. I wish it had a diferent bottle type. * I use this moisturizer either mixed w/my other face creams ,alone over serums or mixed with my bronzing drops. it's great when you have dry skin & a little goes a long way. I have bought the 6.76oz size & I need to get another. * This lotion makes my skin soft and dewy without being greasy.

I will always recommend using this product * I'm not sure why this happened if my skin is really good with salicylic acid in fact it prefers it then benzyl peroxide so I decided to try this out. I put it on overnight after my moisturizer as much as my pointer finger and I woke up the next day, my breakouts worse so I just stopped using it right then and there kind of disappointed was hoping for good results.🥺 * I love how it feels on my skin and i think it would add hydration to my skin. * My daughter tried the face wash and this gel and her face had a terrible reaction. No, no new foods or other items. She immediately began burning. Her face is like this on both sides and she has never had sensitive reaction to any other product. * I have dry, but clear skin. However, summertime + makeup = sweaty breakouts. So to stay on top of it, I started using this product once daily during my nighttime routine. Started working in just a few days of use. Now, instead of having several problem areas after a full day of wearing a full face of  makeup and sweating, I maybe have just small baby blemish that resolves itself overnight. It also does not dry out my skin more than it already is, if anything my skin has been feeling softer and more hydrated. I use La Roche Posay double repair moisturizer and it works well alongside it. With how well this has worked for me, I'm excited to try more products from them. Highly recommend! * i love this brand so much i've literally never been disappointed with any of their stuff but my makeup grips onto this like the hydro grip primer i am in love!! I've always had issues with layering and pilling no matter what i changed before but this product is crazy good and makes it easy, here to repurchase AGAIN. please good molecules never stop making this product and just try it especially if u have oily or combo skin"

195,peach slices,redness relief calming cream,pimprod2033305,2597521," * I was in need of a moisturizer and was drawn to this one because of its claims to reduce redness. My skin gets quite dry in the winter and unfortunately this was not enough to help it feel moisturized throughout the day. I needed to add extra hydrating serums with this moisturizer to keep my skin from feeling tight. It may be a good summer time moisturizer though! I also don't think it helps a lot with redness. I have persistent redness around my nose and cheeks and I didn't really notice a difference. It does give a nice glow after the initial application, but does not really lock in moisture. * I have dry, acne prone skin and was worried this wouldn't provide enough moisture or break me out but it's just as moisturizing as thicker lotions and didn't cause any breakouts/clogged pores! My face is naturally a little red and this does help tone it down a bit. It absorbs well and doesn't pill when mixed with other skincare or makeup. * This has helped with my rosacea and my dryness on my chin and face in general doesn't feel oily or sticky, feels very light on my face! * i have sensitive skin and struggle with some redness so i bought this product. it caused a real bad reaction, my face flared up in splotches and it burned for a few hours * My skin gets better and better (and less red). I also use Burt's Bees facial oil (oil first, then cream). And I added a cold rinse when I'm done cleansing my face or in the shower. I'm so pleased with the results. The weight of this cream is just right - my skin feels healthy but not greasy or heavy. * Disclaimer: I do not use this for the redness relief 
This is by far the only moisturizer that has worked for me and my dry skin. I couldn't justify getting it again after the first time despite it working because of the price but after spending probably even more money trying to find another moisturizer that works for me I realized nothing works like this does. It actually obsorbs into my skin and leaves it hydrated unlike other moisturizers where they go on and my skin still feels dry no matter what. It makes my face look glowy and dewy and I love that feeling so much bc I don't even have to use a lot either! But I feel like it is a bit expensive for how little you get but I'm willing to look past that since this is the only thing working for me. * I have sensitive skin and I struggle with eczema flair ups around my face and eyes. I bought this during one of my worst flair ups. This, with the matching cleanser, single handedly balanced my skin back to normal. This is a very nourishing, light weight moisturizer that feels so calming and soothing on my skin and helps reduce my redness. I will say I get the best results if I double moisturize with this product. I have tried switching up my skincare since I first started this product and everytime I get a flair up. Once I start using this moisturizer and the cleanser again, my skin resets back to normal. This also layers nicely under makeup and is nonburning on eczema patches. I love this product and cant recommend it more."

I have dry skin, and I think it feel wonderful, but I would imagine someone with lily skin not liking this product. 

I'm pretty fair, so white cast isn't something I worry about, but I imagine if you have darker skin you might need to spend some time getting this to rub in fully. 

I use this everyday on top of vit C, and have had some of the best skin of my life. I've used almost 2 tubes and am getting ready to buy a third. * A little goes a long way.  Blends in nicely.  Recommended on Yuka app for clean beauty. * Loved this on my skin! Doesn't irritate or clog pores. Sits well under my foundation and doesn't pill or leave white marks. * The formula is so dense it feels heavy on the skin. I know it's a mineral sunscreen but it leaves such a noticeable white cast. Don't even think about putting other products under because every single one I've tried has pilled off when I go to rub it in * I have very sensitive skin, vanicream is the only brand I have found that doesn't cause a breakout or dry out my  very dry skin. the only con I have for this SPF is it is really oily the first 30ish minutes after applying, even on my very dry skin. I would purchase again though due to being the only product that hasn't caused a breakout or dried out my skin. I love that it is 100% mineral sunscreen as I am allergic to chemical ones. * it was very oily on my skin, left a white cast, and when i put makeup on top of it it made it very patchy * I wanted to love for the spf + moisturizer but it left my skin feeling sticky. I have dry skin. It felt like my skin wasn't absorbing it. It felt like no mather how mucb you rub it in it wont absorb. It also has a white cast, I usually never minded it but with this one I did."

I have very dry and mature skin and generally need a very thick moisturizer so, thus one surprised me!  It's super light, absorbs very quickly and keeps my skin moisturized all night. * One of the best moisturizers ive used and ive used quite a few.

I am a minimalist when it comes to my daily makeup routine, so this fits in perfectly. I use it about 5 minutes after my skincare products dry and then put this on along with some bronzer, under eye concealer and mascara and I am good to go. It covers up redness and slight imperfections in my skin, but does not look at all like I'm wearing foundation/makeup. It does leave my skin a little glossy and take a little time for it to soak into the skin, but I'm OK with that especially for this price point. * Used so many expensive brands. Bought this for a trip and is now my go to! * this product is all water and some moisturizer * I did not love this product but im sure it works for some people * I did not love this product but im sure it works for some people * Some say this is too oily for them, but I didn't mind the consistency. I usually go barefaced but I like to do eye makeup sometimes, and enjoy a good base, but foundation sucks on me, separating and drying the skin. I use this sparingly, tapping on only certain areas with redness, and it works great. I blend it out, and because I'm a bit more fair than the hint of olive I might dab a bit of foundation in a couple spots, and it looks great. compared to other green products 3 times the price, I prefer this. the other ones always have dried me out and sank into pores/lines, looking chalky, but when I wear this I look moisturized and alive. * Figured this would be a good option for when going to the gym or small errands but it's just not good. It leaves my face feeling greasy/oily plus it barely covered my redness."

Taking it back * but, unfortunately I don't. I have really oily skin & thought the gel texture would be great for me. -I DO like that, but after using this every morning for a week my skin started to break out a little. I kept using for another week to see if my skin was just purging. I'm still have the breakouts. I normally don't have that happen with other facial moisturizers I've used. I don't have sensitive skin. Sad, but I am returning this product and going back to my regular moisturizer. * I don't have sensitive skin.

I use Olay sensitive during the winter months and usually add Neutrogena SPF, but I found this product this spring and decided to try it. I absolutely love. I use serum first and then this. I absorbs nicely and doesn't leave my skin sticky. I use under my eyes and my eye lids and I do not experience any burning. I occasionally use powder foundation and it holds all day. the scent is nice and not over powering like other products. * Wanted to love this product however it burns my eyes!! * Great product. * I can only put this on about half of my face because of how incredibly badly it makes my eyes sting. Even if I take care to avoid the eye area, it creeps in them somehow. Feels nice as a moisturizer but it makes me look more sweaty/oil slick than glowy. Have to completely cover my face with setting powder for my skin to not look wet. * this product provided a good moisturizer for my skin but it left my skin oily. I used it with a hydrating serum after but I also used the moisturizer by itself and it still made my skin oily. It made my face smell like sunscreen but it helped with an initial layer of sun protection. If it wasn't so oily I would like this product."

Absolutely love and the travel size is perfect for me! * I was looking for a product that would give me thick and creamy and this one does just that! Need to use a very little amount to get the job done! Not greater clogging at all! * 👍👌 * I absolutely love this cream! It's kinda pricey especially for such a small container but overall it works great :) * This product is not magic. It's an OK moisturizer. Doesn't really have any pleasant or offensive smell. May have made my face slightly softer, I didn't notice any improvement and wrinkles. My main issue is the cost and also the travel sized container would require you to bring Q-tips or an applicator with you. You can't fit even a finger into the tiny opening to get the product out. Will use what I have, but wouldn't buy again. * I wouldn't buy again- it was super annoying because of the pilling."

I trusted them as an early brand for clean beauty, when that category was much (much) smaller. While this product smelled amazing, and soaked in great...I started breaking out. I couldn't figure it out for a week!

Not only are octyl salicylate and octocrylene not reef safe, but they also break me out terribly with what feels more like a burn. Stay away, if not for yourself - for the environment. * I was very excited to find a daily moisturizer with the bonus of having sun protection. However, I don't want to smell like I'm going to the beach at work (or anywhere else for that matter). It's kinda heavy and makes your eyes water from burning. * I absolutely love this moisturizer!! It is a bit greasy but if u have dry skin this is my go to. I love the subtle smell too! I would recommend this. Just don't get it near your eyes if possible. It will burn ur eyes * it's a bit greasy even after soaking into my normal skin, and has been causing me to break out. It smells amazing and feels nice, but I really miss the Sea &C magnifying primer that was discontinued. The finish was better and didn't make me break out at all. * I don't know why I thought that maybe this time regular American chemical sunscreen actives wouldn't burn the crap out of my face. This product irritated my skin really bad. I bought the whole line and had such bad breakouts and dry skin that it took at least two months to regain even a semblance of normal skin and I only used the line for at best two weeks (but the sunscreen was only once on the face). I was using this on my chest as sunscreen until I started breaking out there too. I have had a bad reaction to nearly all of Pacifica's products and I think I'm done even trying. * The moisturizer works great and smells amazing. However, it's not the best for oily skin. I have combination oil skin and my skin gets very, very oily with this after a few hours. I gave it 4 stars just for that reason. If you have normal or dry skin, I think this would work better."

It keeps my skin so hydrated (with no breakouts) during these dry winters and summers in utah. Amazing product. I dont see myself switching moisturizer for a long long time.

Their thermal spring water and cicalfate balm is amazing. However, this has such a strong fragrance I'm afraid I will have a reaction to it."

Fragrance is subtle. Only need a little, absorbs quickly but keeps my face hydrated all day. Doesnt clog my pores or cause breakouts. Layers well under my sunscreen and makeup. There is a version with spf but its not enough, and it feels heavy. I prefer this version, and layer my spf50 over this. Also love that its refillable. * Leaves my face feeling hydrated and plumped and smooth * I rarely get irritated skin from a skincare product, but this cream irritated my face so badly. After applying in the morning, by nighttime, my skin was red, itchy, and breaking out. Over the next few days. my face was super dry and peeling. Not sure which ingredient was the cause but this cream was disappointing, had to return. * This product make my skin soft and smooth, only little bit is enough for the skin * Really love how this isnt greasy or sticky. The scent is nice. My makeup looked so good over it w a primer, but I'd prefer it had a sunBLOCK. SPF 40, at least. I feel naked w/out more sun protection. Otherwise, loved it."
207,avÃ¨ne,tolerance control skin recovery balm,pimprod2026570,2586856," * I tried this product for 2 weeks and I now have dry flaky skin on my cheeks and nose. I bought this product because I have sensitive skin that gets a little drier in the winter months, but my skin has never been this dry in my life! 
Pros: it dries quickly and applys nice under makeup. Not greasy. 
Cons: dried up my skin into a flaky mess. * Since I have hypothyroidism, my skin was always super dry and I would have a lot of rashes as a result. But, this lotion is sensitive enough not to irritate my skin furthermore and durable enough to lock in moisture to eliminate dryness without clogging up my pores. Happy i came across this brand because I have wasted a lot of money before finding this product. * Please never remove this. It's the only moisturizer I've ever been able to use without triggering my acne!! I never have any product related breakouts anymore!! Finding a good moisturizer that worked for my skin was soo hard. This is so perfect and I've been using it for probably a year now. * I use retinol and aha products regularly so every now and then my skin peels and gets red and sensitive. I have tried a lot of soothing and calming products on the market to fix my occasionally irritated skin but so far this one is the only one that doesn't hurt when applied and that actually calms my skin down. I have used both its cream and balm version. They are both great but I like the balm one a little better. * Glides onto the skin nicely and leaves a nice hydrated finish to the skin. Very soothing for dryness without clogging pores * In recent years i've developed excema on my eyelids, chin & ear lobes. I've tried so many moisturizers that claim to help reduce redness and lock in moisture, but it wasn't until I found this product that my skin changed for the better. I bought the 3 pack sample with the facewash and thermal water and fell in love with all. 

First purchased back in September 2022 & still using the same 3 products today. I even tried to change back to some old products that used to work for me and my skin returned to the brittle and scaly old self that used to be. I remain consistent with this brand, and they have shown me love back, my skin soaks this stuff in and doesnt break me out whatsoever. 

Super gentle and refreshing. One of my favorite pros is that it leaves my irritated and stinging skin, smooth and calm. if you have irritated skin that stings, even when you put your moisturizer on it, this product is definitely for you and will help with that sensation. * This is my favorite Avene product! So much that I finished my first tube and bought two more! It has been very helpful for my dry face this winter and I love using it at night over my serums."

Tighten plump and hydrated silky skin! I also use on my neck and chest. Staple in my routine now ! * I have tried many moisterizers and overnight moisturizers and THIS one is beat smelling best smoothing lifting brightening and cost efficient product with no bad reactions on my skin! No burn just smooth texture all day. I love this because most give me hwasaches the second i out them on becausebof fragrance but this smells sooo good without any pain to my eyes or head! I can't recommend enough, will be repurchasing! I bought when it was on thanksgiving sale! * PUR's Get A Lift moisturizer has become a staple in my beauty routine! I've been using it for a year and have purchased it three times now. I've only ever bought it when it's on sale, but I honestly think even at full price it would be worth it! I'm 34 with combo skin, leaning more towards oily. My skin is also flaking and peeling right now due to my prescription skincare treatment and the cold weather. This moisturizer does an excellent job keeping my skin hydrated without pilling or weighing it down, and it keeps the peeling down to a minimum, if any! Once it's absorbed, my skin looks nice and dewy instead of greasy, and I've seen improvement in both softness and texture of my skin. It does burn occasionally if I have patches that are particularly red/irritated, but the burning stops quickly and there's no irritation afterwards. The scent is light, sort of citrusy, and it doesn't linger. I use it every evening and one jar lasts me about 4-5 months. Overall I highly recommend this moisturizer! * This facial cream feels great on my skin. I use it daily to help with loss of elasticity and firmness, especially around the jawline. I really do think it's helped my 60+  yr. old skin. * This moisturizer feels amazing on my skin and so luxurious. I would buy again! * I bought this during black Friday sales and biggest regret was not buying more while on discount.

The formula feels amazing in my skin, it literally feels so luxe. And there is noticeable difference to my skin. I'm actually obsessed!"

As another review mentioned it seems to pill. * Made my foundation peel right off. The primer itself feels nice ans hydating but would not recommend putting makeup on top. * I use this product every day with or without makeup, it feels so nice on my skin and keeps it hydrated and gives it a nice glow. * Had such high hopes due to multiple influencers recommending this product. Didn't notice much difference in the appearance of my combo, dehydrated skin. Worst of all id the fact that this product PILLS and doesn't play nice with much of any other skincare products nor makeup. Really wanted this to work! * I used this religiously from the ages of 15-17 and it was my favorite makeup product. I reordered it on sale last week at the age of 25 and it is still so amazing, but not hydrating enough for me anymore. I love the smell, its super light but lingers in the best way. I will still use it and probably reorder but will be prepping with a heavier moisturizer before applying this under makeup. I also really love it for a no makeup makeup day because it just seems to make my skin even and glowy. * I just turned 44 and am feeling it. I purchased a bag of new products including this moisturizer on the recommendation of 2 employees. I wore it for the first time on Thursday with mascara and eyeshadow. A female coworker told me, ""I hope that this doesn't get me into trouble, but your face looks so good. You have the natural glow of someone that just had a good time."" So needless to say I will wear this every day for the rest of my life. * My skin isn't the most sensitive, but it does have random triggers that cause redness and irritation. My face broke out in red irritated blotches, especially near my eyebrows. Love FAB, but this one ain't for me :("

My skin feels smooth and fresh I recommend it. * Not as moisturizing as I would have wanted. My skin felt dry soon afterwards. Perhaps there is too much water in the formula which evaporates quickly. I prefer a slightly richer formula to nourish my skin. * I am in my late 20's and I notice my forehead was starting to have deep wrinkles and my neck was starting to form unappealing wrinkles. I tried this product out. After week, I definitely notice the difference on my forehead. The lines got softer. Definitely recommend trying the product out and add it to your skin routine."

I now use it every night and morning.  Like a miracle! * I have recently been dealing with dry patches on my face, especially around my nose, eyebrows snd chin. It was causing my face to feel extremely greasy, yet dry at the same time. When i would shower there would always be an insane amount of dead skin, and after using my regular products in my skincare routine my face was not feeling hydrated at all. I picked this up after doing some research and after one use my skin feels plump and hydrated! I have extremely fair and sensitive skin with alot of redness on my face and this product did not itritate my skin in the slightest. I applied after using La Roche Posay's gentle face wash for normal to oily skin and the difference I feel after this combo is insane. A little product goes a long way, as it is a little thik when cominb out of the tube but this is my new go to moisturizer! * I have been suffering from eczema for a while now and I didn't want to use my prescription anymore or cortisone lotions. I wanted to use something a bit more natural. This helps with itching, redness and bumps. It's moisturzing as well. I really love using this lotion and I wish I had found this sooner. * I have very severe eczema and I have tried everything for my face rash. This cleared up the redness in 1-2 days and it also is helping clear up the flakiness on my face. I use it on my body too and it helps and feels very nourishing. * I have psoriasis and eczema and I have tried all kinda lotions. None of them seemed to have helped but I came across this and gave it a try. 

My skin was instantly moisturized and it dulled the redness even the reduced flakiness by alot.

It is cooling on the skin and decent under a tinted moisturizer. * This product has helped my oiliness slightly, and did not irritate the sensitive areas on my face, and doesn't burn when applying.

There is no scent, which I appreciate. * I liked. * I have had trouble finding a good go-to lotion thats not greasy, and this is amazing. I use it everyday AM and PM, and it leaves my face feeling so smooth and clean without the feeling of a heavy moisturizer.

Not these and I love the moisturizer for morning and night. * My skin is always dry even after trying other moisturizers the next day its super dry.

With the larger amount I was using I didn't find it very hydrating and my face felt tight. It also left a white cast and was a little streaky. The absolute deal breaker was the burning in my eyes. I cannot open my eyes at all with how bad it is. Even after washing my face the burning sensation won't go away. A waste of money and a lot of tears. * I love the original Ultra Repair Moisturizer so I bought this one hoping it would be the same. I found it  hard to rub into my skin. It felt like it just sat on top of my skin. It also burned my eyes. Even when I'm careful not to get it anywhere near my eyes I end up tearing up pretty bad. * This burned my eyes horribly. * Feels amazing * Feels amazing * Not moisturizing at all and leaves white cast * I bought because I have dry skin.

The fact it contains the stable form of Vitamin C that most dermatologists prefer to recommend is of course THE reason to use it. I also LOVE that they didn't add fragrance to mask the  normal smell of the vitamin C ingredient. Yes, that odd ""hot dog?"" scent is just what the vitamin C smells like, and it dissipates in less than a minute. * Bought this product about a month ago, I was worried at first about spending so much money, but it was time to drop the dime. I'll be turning 35 soon and my skin was dull, dry and sometimes had red patches that would burn when using other creams, correctors and moisturizers. 
Since using this product my skin looks just as young and fresh as it did in my 20's!

I'm pretty picky with skin products since I worked in the beauty industry for decades and I'm in my 50s. I loved this so much I tried the triple repair thinking it would be even better for dry skin. Nope. This makes my skin feel and look so much better so I came back to this.  It's a perfect staple for long lasting moisture for face or body.. neck especially. It's nice and thick, has no scent and good for sensitive dry skin. Apply on damp skin! * I use this as my daily face moisturizer and it works great. This is a lotion, not a cream, so it's water based and works well for my oily skin because it absorbs quickly without residue. I like that it doesn't make it worse like other moisturizers (also doesn't cure my oiliness but thats not the point). It's an easy pump to grab in the mornings and has lasted me so long.

I've dabbled in other moisturizers, but nothing ever has the same consistency throughout the day as ky origins regime. I'm hooked!! * I have dry skin. I had high expectations for this product……. It didnt absorb and made my skin look so dry…. It also peeled off. It hust stayed on top of my skin and peeled off once dry. Bad bad bad * I think this product has been causing my skin to break out more than usual and leaving small red spots. I think maybe its just a little too greasy and oily. It does hydrate, but not quite in the right way. If youre in a jam and this is all you have around, its better than no moisturizer, but I wouldnt buy again. The smell is nice, if you like citrus, and it does have a refreshing feeling. Maybe if you dont drink any water and your skin is actually in need of oil and lots of hydration this might be a good product for you."
229,la roche-posay,"mela b3 uv daily moisturizer sunscreen, spf 30",pimprod2043466,2620363," * This product disappointed me. I tried it for about a week, and I woke up to three new acne spots, which was strange because the website claims it is non-comedogenic. However, when I looked into the ingredients, I was disheartened to find that it contains shea butter, which can clog pores, especially for those with oily skin. I really wanted to love it, but unfortunately, I can't. * AVOID WEARING UNDER MAKEUP - PILLING 
I always wear makeup under foundation/concealer and i usually keep my base routine super simple (e.g. water-based serum plus sunscreen). I applied this sunscreen under my makeup twice already and both times my foundation pilled and separated. I applied the foundation using a puff sponge. Now, I will only apply this sunscreen on no makeup days and will use as a hand sunscreen as well. * I love it * Introducing Mela B3 UV Daily Sunscreen featuring Melasyl, the multi-patented La Roche-Posay ingredient that was 18 years in the making. Also contains 5% Niacinamide. When used daily and reapplied as needed, this power packed combination corrects dark spots and skin discoloration while respecting the natural complexion of all skin tones.

Im surprised so many people like it. * This is the best hydrating cream ive ever tried, its so good love the way if feels on my skin and how it leaves my skin 10/10 recomend. It works amazing under my makeup and makes my base look better. Small issue is that I wish there was more product in the containers because it's so good and I have to repurchase way more than any other product I have. * This product has no SPF protection. This product does not penetrate the skin, so it is bot weirdly greasy yet the skin is dry/unmoizturized underneath the slippery surface. I do not recommend. * This is the most hydrating product that I use, and I have used a lot of different brands. It doesn't clog pores, it's smooth on my skin. I will keep on purchasing this great product! * Love this moisturizer. Not too thick and heavy but very moisturizing. Love how my face feels after applying this. Wake up with my face feeling so hydrated and soft. Would highly recommend. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't break me out. Doesn't have that strong perfume smell either. * I got this as a birthday gift sample. Let me just say this product did not disappoint. I have really dry skin especially in the winter and any other time its combo. I was recently in Canada, and I was so concerned about my makeup flaking because of how dry my skin was and no matter how much moisturizer from Dermalogica or La Roche Posay makeup was still flaking, even with primer. I even bought Mac moisturizer since I used their foundation and it still flaked even worse. I had to order the full size because no moisturizer has done this to my skin. Recommending to all my friends and family. * Honestly i loved the initial feeling if this, the crewm feels thick and cool and as you rub it together it turns kind of into a thinner consistancy. But with my dry, texured compromised skin it burned and felt like a weird slick silicone consistency, and my skin still felt dry. I read thet it has citric acid and lactic acid and that could be the burning? Or im allergic. Either way for something thats called a water barrier hyaluronic moisturizer it did not give that at all."

I love this. Put in in your PR * This is my new favorote SPF for my face. It absorbs quickly into the skin, does a great job protecting my skin from the sun, and smells divine. I have even worn it under makeup without any issues. * Great face lotion with spf. Lotion with spf that does not have a white cast on the skin. I love it and gives a great glow to the face * I received this sunscreen after attending their promotional walk for the launch of the product. I noticed the very next day I started getting micro bumps that resembled milia or granulomatous. I stopped wearing make up and switched to a gentle cleanser to see if those were the reasons however I remained applying the sunscreen to obviously help protect my face. To my surprise, my skin was only getting worse. It was starting to burn and itch. I've been allergy tested, and I don't have any. The day I didn't use the sunscreen, my skin condition immediately disappeared, so I went to look at the ingredients list. I don't know if Origins is using the oils from grapefruit, lemon and orange for fragrance purposes, but it does not list anywhere that they have extracted the furanocoumarins. After meeting with my dermatologist, I was advised that the citrus oils used in the sunscreen caused photosensitivity, and burned/ irritated my skin. If you are someone with darker or sensitive skin, I HIGHLY recommend AVOIDING this."

Started using this product again this week remembered why I love this! My face is becoming rehydrated again. The brightness is coming back and my rosacea is subsiding. I do have sensitive skin and this seems to do the trick to balance pH levels. If you have tried other products with no luck, try this product. Not every product fits everyone but this one is definitely worth the try. To me... worth every cent🙏 * 'My daughter is 14 and this product has been great for her acne * I love to try new products so I've experimented with a number of daily moisturizers with SPF like Drunk Elephant and Unseen Sunscreen and always come back to this Murad holy grail. It doesn't leave a white cast, is moisturizing, non-greasy, and doesn't pill under my makeup. I use this daily and a bottle lasts me roughly 4 months. I'm honestly shocked at other reviews saying they broke out as I have acne prone skin and never have but YMMV. * This is a decent sunscreen, rubs in fine and makes my skin soft. However this burns my eyes soooo bad. Obviously I know to not get sunscreen in my eyes, but it doesn't matter how carefully I put it on, my eyes burn. I have very sensitive & dry eyes and it just doesn't work. The Tula one in the yellow bottle, is the one I continue to go back too. * I was very excited to try this but was disappointed to find the results being similar to a drug store brand product not to mention this product caused my skin to break out and become oily. Never had those issues with my skin before starting to use this. Also the product just pours out of the bottle causing you to end up wasting product every time you use it which makes you run out a lot faster than you would expect. * I have heard great things about Murad so I finally decided to treat myself to this moisturizer. I wanted to love it SO bad but my skin has BLOWN UP with acne so bad, it's starting to really get to me. I used to struggle with acne but it had gotten to be almost non-existed until I bought this. At first I thought my pregnancy hormones had caused my flare up, and it could be a contributor, but this is really the only new piece of my skincare regimen and it seems like others have had the same bad experience as me too. Will be throwing it away and buying my old moisturizer. * As always, every experience can be different but I'll tell you mine: I have very sensitive skin , dry to normal, rarely have acne besides the occasional pimple. When I started using this, my face broke out like a crunch bar. TONS of bumps and several pimples. I started a new night cream at the same time so I wasn't sure, but as soon as I stopped using this my face cleared. It was pretty instant, at the end of the day the bumps were the worst and I would wash my face and wake up to no bumps (not what happens with typical acne). If you haven't heard of acne cosmetica, google it that way you can watch out for it with this product or any others. After looking closer I realized THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS SOME COMEDOGENIC INGREDIENTS (i.e. ethylhexyl palmitate)"

Im on day 2 and WOW my skin looks soooooo smooth and clear!! I noticed it got rid of my acne too!! 🥹 Love love it! Worth every peny! I used to buy the sunday riley luna sleeping night oil double the cost of this and have not seen this much improvement in such a short term like this!! * After a few days i noticed a cluster of bumps on my neck and chest area. I figured it was from something else like perfume, but then I noticed smaller bumps on my face. I don't consider my skin sensitive so i am surprised. I wish this worked out. * After having my baby, part of my postpartum recovery included extremely dry skin around my chin and T-zone area. It was SOOOOOO bad. My makeup application was the worst showing patchy skin. I tried so many things to help, including high-end luxurious products, but nothing worked until I tried this for weeks. I saw it changed the texture of my skin that included smoother and moisturized skin. I love it so much, I just bought a second one. The scent is also light. Nothing too crazy. This was good to my sensitive skin. Highly recommend!!!! * This product did make my skin feel feel and look amazing.  However, it also caused acne breakouts that I hadn't experienced in many years.  For that reason, I can't use this product.  I wasn't prone to breakouts so it was a bit surprising. * Smooth and penetrates well. Skin feels soft and smooth"

After i wash my face and dry/damp, I then use the water cream and let that sink into the skin. its very light weight and feels really smooth on the skin. 
It wont be a single step hydrate cream but it really does help! I like to put on a moisturizing lotion after it sets and my skin has never felt better! * I have normal to dry skin and this doesn't do the job. Maybe it is just for oily skin. Even when I use HA and/or oil serum. Feels like it barely does anything after I apply it. But it doesn't clog pores which is nice. I will save it for summer when it is more humid, but I'll have to find another moisturizer to get through winter. * this is SUCH a great moistuizer and SUCH a good price for as much as you get as well as the skin benefits too. I litterally tell everyone i know about this one * Really good moisturizer. Even with oily skin, this product works for me! Sadly I can't just run to Ulta to pick up a new tub anymore :( Thankfully it's not completely gone from the lineup! * I was tired of having to repurchase an expensive moisturizer until I gave this product a try!

I'm 43, menopause. My skin is desperately dry, withered, wrinkled, lost density, and now acneic. 😫
This cream is sensational. I live in arid dry cold Colorado and this cream is very viscous - like elmers glue! It remains on the skin hours later, sealing in plumping moisture, but NOT occlusive. Great ingredients list, zero fragrance, and wears well under tinted SPF. High shine though - so I use a setting powder over it in some places. Not causing break outs, and lessens the appearance of fine lines. * Glass packaging that in my opinion preserves the product better with excellent ingredients and a texture of a fine cream that absorbs completely into the skin without leaving it oily and contains a soft scent. * I love it let my face rest moisturizer * This is rhe perfect not to heavy moisture but not to light! I gave this to my 3 year old and she absolutely loves it! I bought it a week ago and she alresh needs a new one! But im not even mad because it is so amazing! Eveeyone needs to buy this it is so good! * On the first and only try after putting it on,I felt a burning sensation and left my skin irritated. * I have dry skin and currently living in a dry climate as well. Ive tried the normal magic cream and it has vegetable oil, fragrance, just a lot of junk. Especially when my forehead can get closed comedones and breakouts easily. I took a gamble and bought the mini and fell in loveee!!! I am so dry in some areas i often peel, so i was prepared to give this away or return (i cant do gel or gel creams becuase of my dry skin). But i was so shocked at how hydrating this is and it make my skin so shiny and glowy and layers so beautifully under makeup. As a sensitive skin girly too, fragrance free is so important to me as fragrances can be irritating. Also, CT is certified cruelty free by leaping bunny, as a girl who lovess animals and only shops cruelty free, so important! Ive since bought the water cream set with the full size and mini that's on the way and I can't wait! Just try it!"
237,beautybio,the zenbubble oil-free calming gel cream,pimprod2019384,2572411," * Someone at ulta recommended me this one, really pricey to me, I usually dont spend over 30 on moisturizers, but this is one of my favorites (not enough for me to consistently buy it though). Goes on light, a little goes a long way I'd say, I have combination skin that used to be really oily but now is rather dry, I'd say it's fine for all skin types personally. Also it comes out by pressing down on it, whenever it runs low you can twist to get the rest of it. I was stressing out trying to get it out before realizing it opens. Again, would buy this all the time if not for the pricing, but pretty worth it * I've purchased this two times now and am loving how light it feels on the skin while being super hydrating for my dry skin. The container pump makes it so easy to apply. * I got this and the eye cream, both burned my eyes and skin. I am sensitive but don't usually break out in a few hours from a product. Also were very sticky long after applying just them and no other products for self testing. * Far from a moisturizer but in fact left my skin super oily. * Hands down the best makeup primer EVER. Its too good. My makeup looks freshly applied all day long. I csnt say enough about it. * I spent alot on this and it did nothing for me. I like how the product is provided. The moisturizer itself caused skin irritation after I used appropriate face cleanser foe skin type. Not for eczema prone or sensitive skin! * The formula is fine—nothing amazing—and there are similar moisturizers at a more affordable pricepoint. I have combo sensitive skin and it didn't irritate my skin. I do really like it when i mix it with my retinol oil at night as it helps dry down the oil faster and keep in the moisture. The packaging is my favorite part with the pump top. When i'm out of this, i'll refill it with my cetaphil night cream. I got it when it was half off but i still think it's too expensive for what it is."

I love a milky SPF for layering other products but even with a heavy moisturizer underneath it dried my skin and caused peeling and flaking * I go through sunscreen like its nothing because I tend to burn easily. This one is lightweight and comfortable. I wear it under makeup without any problems like some cause. The only downside is the price for the size youre getting, but otherwise I love this product and will be buying it again. * I love the texture and feel of this sunscreen and it doesn't cause acne for my very sensitive skin. Downside is it goes quickly and the price point is too high. * I have sensitive, dry skin. I'm newer to using sunscreen daily. I researched many brands and this had great reviews, so I bought it hoping for the best. Using it over my serums has helped them work their magic. My dark spots have eased up and my expression lines are less prominent. My skin is more hydrated and plump. I plan to keep using this because ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" and it works perfectly for me! Also, sometimes when I introduce a new product, my skin has a bad reaction (redness, irritation, breakout) and this sunscreen has not caused any negative reactions."

Love it * My skin feels smooth and moistureized. * This is my night cream ever night.  It works, It does not irritate my skin. What's not to love about that? * I received a sample of this and did wear sunscreen during the day. The first night it went on everything seemed fine. It went on with no problem. The second day I felt a little tight itching? By the third day I started seeing peeling around my nose and my face felt itchy and burny. Not an overwhelming itch but enough to recognize I'm having a bad reaction. Peeling, itching and a slight burning sensation. I didn't use makeup the first two days but when I put makeup on the third day, it went on blotchy and I could see the irritation on my cheeks, mostly below my eye area. I'm Pacific Islander, NC30 and in my 40's, sadly this product is not for me. * Product is usually good. But got a bad batch and felt bad so I didn't bring it back.

It's nongreasy, unscented formula glides onto the skin smoothly. It's lightweight and is great for morning and night use. I like it so much that I went back to buy more ""good light"" products! * My new go to moisturizer! I have sensitive combo skin and my skin just loves the hydration this leaves all day. My skin feels so soft and healthy after using it. Nice enough in the summer alone but even better for the fall/winter in the midwest over their abc oil. Fragrance free too. * I really like this face cream for the winter. I live in a high desert climate and have combination skin; this isn't great for all year long but in the winter it's perfect especially after a day outside in harsh conditions. Definitely not lightweight and would be too heavy/ oily for someone with oily skin or in a humid climate but it's great when I need it! As a bonus, I love the packaging. It's not my holy grail and it's more expensive for the size than some other creams that do essentially the same thing but it does it's job well! * Im very picky on what i use on my skin, and this is my holy grail!! I just purchased my 4th bottle today. Its thick and will last all night keeping you moisturized. Its light scented as well! The bottle isnt super huge and its a bit pricey but definitely worth it! * This moisturizer is nothing short of amazing! Perfect! I've tried them all. This is rich, thick, and best of all..no scent! This pairs so nicely with the milky toner and my retinol and vitamin C regiment. * This stuff is by far the top budget-friendly cream I have purchased! It rivals the ones that are over $100."

After using this moisturizer, I have had several instances of bad luck with getting a new pimple the next morning. The texture and application (no burning) of this product are fine. It does its job to moisturize the skin. However, not without suffering more blemishes sadly. I picked this while trying to find noncomedogenic moisturizers with clean ingredients according to Yuka, but my mom helped point out to me later this has vegetable oil in it… Cool! 🙃 * its just perfect and a little goes a long way * I dont really know what people are saying about this product, most people are saying its lightweight and non greasy but it feels so heavy, sticky, and greasy on my face, maybe just not for me but I won't be buying this again * I have sensitive skin and this works well for me. Love that it isnt too heavy on my combo/acne prone skin * I was hoping this product would work well on my acne-prone skin, but it doesn't seem to do much for me. It doesn't absorb very well into the skin so the more you use the more ends up sitting on your face. The claims about this moisturizer being pre-biotic don't seem to mean much.

Now I'm just praying these new wrinkles fade. * It's just temporary, so keep that in mind. * These are not very strong and theyre small. If you havent tried ""frownies"" i suggest trying those. Theyre cheaper for a larger quantity and better results. * I tried these on a few spots on my face, under eyes, smile lines, and 11 lines on forehead. I honestly wouldnt bother using these under your eyes because the adhesive is so strong it pulls at your skin even with wetting them. They did work well on my smile lines and 11 lines but they just soften the wrinkles, my results only lasted about 1 week.

253,kinship,supermello hyaluronic gel cream,pimprod2017767,2569973," * I wanted to love this product! The smell/texture is lovely.

Unfortunately, while sporting a ""clean ingredients"" tag and a tag from the national eczema association, I found the product to be highly irritating when I had a flare up. I only used it once during that time, and then after taking a second look at the ingredients, I found out that ""phenoxyethanol"" is a known potential allergen, irritant, potential endocrine disruptor, and the manufacturing process is highly polluting. In other countries the ""safe"" threshold for this ingredient is 1%, but it's hard to determine how much one is exposed to if applying daily/multiple times a day. Of course, there is no such regulation in US, so who knows how much is in this cream. 

At the same time I bought this, I tried products from cocokind which I highly recommend! They have a great price point and really are ""clean"" from what I have used so far, although one should always do their own research. While I was still having an eczema episode, I found using a homemade oatmeal paste + cocokind's chia seed oil was very helpful to get me through the dry itchiness. 

TLDR: not a clean product, could be irritating, check out cocokind. * I've been being treated for cancer for about a year and a half, now. Almost 6 months of that has been chemotherapy. Most products cause acne and rashes on my skin, since being on treatment. 
Pros: Did not irritate my overly sensitive skin. Smells good. I don't understand all the complaints about the smell. It is light and nice. It is kind of like marshmallows, but better. 

Cons: it moisturizes, but not enough while going through chemo. It feels great when I first put it on. But, after a few hours my skin feels tight again. Kind of like how vaseline can trick you into thinking your skin is moisturized at first. Hours later the surface of your skin feels tight and dry like a sunburn ready to peel. 

For the price, thete are much better options. Philosophy moisturizers are a lottle cheaper and give better longer lasting results for me in terms of moisture. * This is my 3rd time repurchasing this moisturizer. Unreal/ must try! * I do not want my face smelling like vanilla frosting but it did the whole time I used this. My fault but I'd literally have to hold my breath * Earlier this year my dermatologist informed me I have seborrheic dermatitis. I've been using ketoconazole shampoo which definitely helps but I still found myself needing to use cortisone cream on my face (gross!!). So I was researching moisturizers good for dermatitis and while Supermello isn't specifically marketed for dermatitis (it does list eczema) I thought it sounded like it may help. I am SO GLAD I gave it a chance!!!!! its been about 2 weeks now and my face is looking the best it's looked in several years. Patches that I thought were stubborn acne have been clearing up and are almost totally gone. the hydration level us just right so I feel moisturizes but don't get greasy as the day goes on. It does smell REALLY lovely with the light vanilla/Marshmallow aroma. Definitely worth trying if you have skin conditions that make you red/itchy! * I got this as a sample and wowww the smell is so good! It's very creamy so a little goes along way! Im so happy I got it as a sample because now Im definately buying more. I love this brand and it also makes my skin glowy and so soft. I love how my skin feels I usually use their Vitamin C then put on this cream and it leaves my skin poreless and soft. * My skin burns from water, I swear. I am incredibly sensitive to everything. My skin chaps, get red and raw, itches and burns. I have tried most of the major 'sensitive' skin moisturizers high to low end, and this is the absolute winner. Keeps my skin moisturized and smells great. I have found it does not do well under makeup so I only use at night and for the first time, thats enough moisture for me."

It is hydrating yes, but it feels heavy on my skin and takes a while to absorb. While i dont hate it, i like my moisturizer to feel light and refreshing, so i wont be getting this again * This cream feels nice on the skin at first and has no discernable fragrance. Over time it started to sting my skin, caused the worst break out I've ever had and made my skin red and puffy. I have no allergies. * It's a gear product, I just wish it came in a 2.0 Ounce pump bottle like the atmosphere protection cream! * This is a lovely cream, it feels light on my skin. I use it at night. My skin feel soft and hydrated in the morning. I especially love that it is cruelty free. * This is my go to day moisturizer. Keeps my skin hydrated all day without being greasy! * I've used this moisturizer multiple times. It's a great Summer moisturizer, light and refreshing. Lasts about 2 months. * I cant get over the smell! But overall great hydration!!"

Def buying another tube! * I have and oily T section and my skin becomes especially red or dry around my cheeks and chin right before my period. I've tried a lot of SPF and finally found one that doesn't leave me ultra shiny and oily.  I really like this product and will keep using it! Only downside is that I think some of the oils in the product settled and the last couple of uses did leave my skin somewhat shiny but other than that, my skin was left soft and even toned! * Contains harmful chemicals that damage our coral reefs. Please make smart consumer choices, this sunscreen is not environmentally safe and my face broke out when using it :( * this sunscreen gave me such a healthy glove, and my skin did not feel oily or greasy at!!!! I used to have the Laroche poosay (I hope i spelled it right) sunscreen, and it would make my skin shiny, but it all oily. I have normal skin and I really love this product. * I'm in my 30's and have always had acne prone, oily skin. A few years ago, I was able to clear up my skin with a strict morning and night routine that includes prescription creams, but every time I would try using SPF, I would immediately break out. I've tried dozens of prestige and drugstore brands! This moisturizer with SPF is the first that hasnt caused a single breakout. I've been using it for over a month now and I will continue to as long as its on shelves. * This product is okay as a moisturizer and sunscreen but leaves you shiny looking. It also does not work well under makeup at all. I learned the hard way after I was almost completely done with my makeup and it began lifting and leaving ugly peeling patches when i used a powder brush. For the price, theres way better sunscreens out there. The murad sunscreen in a blue bottle is about the same size and the same price but works amazing. * I switched to this sunscreen and my pores and oily skin were controlled also my skin felt amazing! I could t rebuy it because I was pregnant but whenever I get my hands on this again I would gladly stick to this only. The only con is the size and price"

I would DEFO recommend and I am looking forward to re-purchase. * Broke my skin out badly right away. * Love this product!! * A little goes a long way. It's so wonderful feeling. You have to experience this to believe it. My skin has become so soft and younger looking. I will definitely keep this in my beauty routine * I mean it...when I say I am nearly 30 and struggled with hormonal skin since I was 12..I have spent SO much money on skincare products, it's insane. Recently I bought a $150 moisturizer claiming it was magic, when THIS..PUR Cloud Cream (for a fraction of the price)..was all I've ever wanted and needed. It is the silkiest product and it just melts into the skin like a drink for your pores. I mix it with a dab of Charlotte Tilbury ""beautiful skin"" foundation and I feel like a million bucks. Immediate confidence boost. It's just enough tint to perfect the redness from my acne and scars...and it leaves the most gorgeous finish, like I just got back from the medspa and my skin is plump, hydrated, and GLOWING. I got this as a sample from Ulta and I had to come back here, buy the full size immediately, and leave a review. I knew nothing about it so when I searched it up I was expecting this to be much more expensive. A double win for it's attainable price!! Please never discontinue. * I am allergic to tocopherol acetate, and this is the only moisturizer I can find at Ulta without it. Thank goodness it works well. Feels nice, not greasy. Absorbs quickly, and isnt strong smelling. * This is one of the only things I can use on my face! I dont have to worry about my face sweating when
I wear it. It is lightweight and is scent free!"

Great product! * Truly oil free. I have oily skin so I can immediately pick up on oily products. Very light weight and good texture. Best I've used so far. * Great product * I had started using the Bareminerals Skin Longevity line but didn't quite care for the daily moisturizer with sunscreen so I bought this product.  I am 60 yoa and have struggled with acne and skin problems since I was a teenager.  I believe it's mostly due to bad genes because my sisters and daughter also had acne problems. This moisturizer absorbs well, but because it is oil free, it doesn't leave my skin shiny or greasy looking. It makes my skin feel fresh and smooth. I do not look my age and I believe that using these Baremineral products contribute to my better looking skin. * I use this daily after cleansing. It is light-weight but easily covers my face & neck. It isn't oily at all. I have used other products in the past. They cause breakouts and leave my face feeling greasy all day or soak in immediately & don't create a good foundation. * Best moisture I have ever used. A little goes a long ways.  My skin has never felt or looked this good. Absolutely love this product.  Please don't ever stop selling this."

I noticed how smooth, how easy to smile it was, and what a big difference it was from the previous years. Using the whole set it's very expensive but if you are careful and use them as indicated they last.  I bought mine on October 2022 and run out of them in February 2023 bravo!!!  And that was because I had to travel to different countries so I ended taking small amounts in my containers when I when to Europe. Then on my way back I travel to Mexico so I took all the bottles because I was going to stay there 3 months. Then my set got finished there   I checked in the fine stores in Mexico but there were no Refills so I had to I'm wait till I return to USA to buy them. I'm strongly recommending the Lancôme Absolute products they all wonderful! Use them carefully and daily! * I love this product, and I've tried quite a few high end moisturizers. I'm 52 a post menopausal. I only gave it 4* because of the price, and the fragrance.  Most over the age of 50 will likely remember a bottle of White Shoulders sitting on their grandmother or mother's vanity, and that's what the smell of this cream reminds me of. Very floral and not just roses. I can live with the price, but I would definitely give it 5* if Lancôme would make a fragrance free version. The fragrance doesn't linger, but the smell reminds me of what old women smelled like when I was a child."

I have combination/oily skin and as much as I loved the products I always struggled with oiliness. I decided to take a break a couple years and I regret it. My skin has significantly changed and not for the better. I tried so many new products and nothing compared. I came back to Estee Lauder and decided to try this Nutritious line, and I absolutely love it!!! This one does not make me oily or shiny and I love the way my Estee Lauder foundation sits on my skin. I will say I bought a whole regime and I'm using the Nutritious essence and moisturizer, and the Perfectionist serum and SPF. I got them on sale during Black Friday sales recently and I couldn't be happier. I can say this moisturizer is making all the difference for me. * Not for me feels to heavy * I have quite dry skin and this product just doesnt work with my skin type. Makes my face look and feel dehydrated. I can maybe understand why this would work for oily folks but not enough for dry skin. * I got this creme in the Glow kit. When I cleanse my face, I apply it as a standalone and immediately see my face turn red. I have sensitive skin, plus large pores. :( * I don't see the hype. Texture of cream felt like light face lotion and went on just the same. I've used it twice as an over night mask and I woke up with dry skin. My Elemis night cream is 5x more nourishing than this ""face mask"" cream. * I live in the Arctic and the cold sucks any moisture out of my skin. I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts from moisturizers and new products. Basically if you touch it, it's going to have issues. I received a sample of this with my last makeup order and this stuff is amazing! I have been using it as my daily moisturizer and my skin is soft, hydrated, and most of all clear!

So purchase if they have original * In my constant quest for skincare products that deliver real results, I recently tried the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid. This lotion claims to gently exfoliate, boost cell turnover, and provide deep hydration to uncover softer, smoother skin. Let's dive into my experience with this multi-tasking formula.

The lotion is non-greasy and lightweight, making it perfect for daily use. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and hydrated without any heavy residue. The product is fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for those with sensitive skin or a sensitivity to strong scents. The natural smell from the lactic acid salts is subtle and varies slightly depending on your skin's unique pH, but it's not overpowering or unpleasant. * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is revolutionary! It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy!"

It is kinda crazy because I've been using Bare Minerals makeup for 25+ years and never considered the skin care products. On impulse, I picked this up and I'm really glad I did. My skin is really happy. In two weeks it has reduced redness, dryness, and you can't see the lines on my forehead anymore.

Yes, it does pill if it is not the last step in your routine. It is my 2nd to last step, and depending on how long I wait to apply the oil afterwards, affects how intensely the moisturizer pills. The moisture and effectiveness is worth it though. If I can't give a good 10 minutes before applying oil, then I will just skip the oil that night. * Biggest disappointment from Ulta so far… not moisturizing… for some reason it dehydrates my skin… dont waste your $$$ * This works great! A little goes a very long way. It's very moisturizer yet not oily. I love this night cream. * Doesn't absorb into the skin as quickly as I would like, but once it is, my face and neck are so bright and refreshed. * Keep The Phenoxyethanol out of products please! 
If Europe can ban Endocrine disruptors why cant we. 
This is like the only ""clean brand"" in the states. So dissapponting.. * I have combo acne prone skin for reference. 
This is like a light watery lotion but absorbs like a rich cream. It soaks right in and paces a velvety, supple feeling that I love. Sometimes my skin is drier so I could see me being able to use this during the day also without being too heavy. It does have a scent. It's like candy strawberry and flowers. It's light and goes away very shortly. You only need a little of this because it spreads so well. It can be easy to go overboard. I think this is definitely worth the money given the ingredients, packaging and how long this will last. Especially compared to other creams. I don't breakout but wake up with super soft, nourished skin. * I want to love this product so badly but the fragrance/essential oils in this caused my eczema to flare up. I'm so sad but I know it's on me for buying something with fragrance, natural or not. Otherwise I think it's a nice product it wasn't drying or anything and the texture is really nice just wish they had a fragrance free version. I will stick with the vegan ceremide cream"

It works for me. * It left my skin very oily and I bought it because it was supposed to be matte. * I usually break out from sunscreen. Even the one my dermatologist prescribed! I went out on a limb to try this 2 in 1 sunscreen and it did not disappoint. Great mattifying and no white cast (I'm a brown skin gal) yet moisturizing. I took this on vacation and it withstood the very hot heat and sun. Two thumbs up for me. * My previous tube was great. Mattified the skin. Absorbed quickly. It did not make my skin oily. This newest tube is not good. While it still absorbs quickly it does not mattify my skin. I am very oily in a couple of hours if not before. I must note that i do shake the tube before use so i dont think im missing anything. * I used this as a cheaper alternative toy usual SPF  but it was greasy and broke me out. If i dont shake it i can see the oil. * I bought this sunscreen on accident because I thought it was a free gift and didn't check until I picked it up in store. However, I decided to use it because I needed a new sunscreen and surprisingly, this worked very well for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it sits on top of my other skin care products very well. This is also the first sunscreen that hasn't irritated my skin or burned my eyes which I truly appreciate because every sunscreen I've worn in the past had an extremely painful reaction on my eyes.

Yes, the one product is smaller than they said in the details, but all of these still last a long time. The face wash has a really nice light citrus smell. I havent used the moisturizer yet because I couldnt read what it was exactly or when to use it (before looking it up) because the white writing on the transparent container was impossible to read on top of being partially rubbed off.

The scent is mild for me personally, I love that it smells like fruit loops lol. Packaging also gets a 10/10 the glass bottle definitley makes it worth the price. Will be repurchasing once I run out (it lasts forever!) * This product has truly shocked me. I have some staple products that I know give my face a glow like no other, but I can't use them every day because they only give me that glow with a few days between uses. I have used this product every day and night for a week, and EVERY SINGLE DAY my face has been almost unrecognizable. I feel pretty with no makeup on for the first time in my life, my makeup sits better on my face when I do use it, and the glow lasts ALL day, well into the night. Oh my goodness, no wonder it's sold out. You can even get away with no moisturizer with this product (I know because I forgot to put moisturizer on one day, that's how good this feels on my skin). For the record, I live in Florida, and have extremely dry skin which actually over produces oil to overcompensate in the humidity. Usually products like this make me break out, but this feels AMAZING. I never have products make my skin glow and not feel oily, but this one really works. This is not a paid review, I only tried this product because of the reviews I saw, bc I'm a creature of habit. I hate trying new products and am terrified of using my skin to test things out. The reviews were the ONLY reason I tried this and this did not disappoint. * Very hydrating on my sentive cobination skin. * I was told about this product through a podcast I listen to. I was currently using the Byoma milky toner and liked it, but still felt my skin could be better/more hydrated. I struggle with small dry spots depending on the day and just overall dryness. After trying this - mid winter- my skin has been supple and stays hydrated throughout the day. I was weary about trying just another toner but this one has surpassed my expectations. It has a light scent but it's manageable. I use a lot of the product at once so I only wish it came in a larger size. It's gentle and haven't noticed any skin irritations. * I hardly ever actually finish a product and if I do it's because I love it so much I can't find a replacement. This is that good- it's my holy grail moisturizing toner and it makes my skin feel so firm but not tight, and so glowy and moisturized! Just bought another one! * I cannot be without this toner ! Just ordered my third bottle, I use it daily and absolutely love it! It has helped so much with my skin, it does not iritate it at all (i have sensitive acne prone skin with rosacea) and leaves it feeling so smooth! I have not been breaking out as much since using this, in fact this product helps to keep my skin at bay when it comes to breakouts and random pimples. Cannot recommend it enough! * Very light toner, makes my skin look and feel amazing, I definitely notice that my skin looks rougher when I run out and don't have a back up bottle."

Aveeno, please don't change this formula ever!! * I am happy this product does not dry out my skin, but I don't feel it will protect my face from sunburn.  That being said, my face was peeling because of the high strength of my lotion. At least it is now not peeling. * The moisturizer did help with my overall skin/was a decent moisturizer, but the pilling is/was so bad, almost constant, even hours after application. It also doesn't sit well under any make-up, even a just light skin tint. The smell is strong, but it honestly just smells like soap so that wasn't an issue for me and I kind of liked it. * This product is light and smells good.  I love that it has SPF. * I've used it for over 10 years. There's been changes with it over the years, but my skin soaks it up like a sponge and leaves me glowing. * Broke me out in hives!

It hydrates without feeling as greasy as the OG, and my skin feels more balanced through the day. I took off one star because it has a smell I can only liken to algae? Sort of a bad, musky, salty smell. But the product is good and I recommend it if you can handle the smell for a half hour until it disspates. If you're sensitive to smells like this I could see it being a problem for you. * I bought this by accident when I was trying to buy the 24-7 day and night moistue. First thing  I noticed was the color, which made me realize I had bought the gel cream. The weightless texure is nice but the smell is absolutely awful. I will not be using this product due to the smell. * I bought this when my previous moisturizer was about to run out. This was on sale and the reviews seemed overall positive. I've used it twice and it's going in the trash. It has a nice, lightweight feel on my skin but the smell is awful. I can't tell if it's supposed to be scented or if it's the smell of just the ingredients but it smells like it's gone bad. There are so many other moisturizers out there that work well, are half the price, and don't leave you smelling like something expired. * Absolutely love this! I never put lotion on my face and just started using this product and I get so many compliments now how nice I look and young. I am almost 45 but I don't look it. * My beauty consultant, Beautifull (yes! that is her name) is the best in the business! I had so many questions when I was looking for a skin routine. I must say my skin is WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. She is located in North Texas! * I stopped buying moisture surge (and clinique in general) earlier this year, and searched for a comparable moisturizer all of 2024. Out of the 15 products I tried this year, this has been the best option by far. I honestly think this gel moisturizer is even better than Clinique's because it's fragrance free and 100% cruelty free. So many moisturizers are also too heavy for my sensitive and acne prone skin, but this is so lightweight and absorbs quickly. It's definitely worth the price, and a little goes a long way. * This is so light and so hydrating, it does not leave any sticky residue on the skin and no harsh smell. It cools the face and gives it a nice glow"

I need it to be moisturizing without making my skin greasy, the texture can not be runny, and it needs to be a high enough SPF without leaving a white cast and feeling/smelling like sunscreen.

I own the tinted version as well, but feel like the tinted makes me look greasy after an hour... where as this version is more of a satin finish where I do not look greasy throughout the day (maybe a little bit on my nose after 6 hours of wear). If you're sensitive to chemical sunscreens, I will say I notice my eyes get a tad bit irritated from it after about 6 hours of wear also. I try to not get close to my eye area, especially on my eyelids with this version. Overall would repurchase. The Paula's Choice Youth Extending Fluid is very close to this with 50spf and I feel doesn't give me the sensitivity. * I work at ulta and I personally would not recommend this to anyone. Ive tried to use this many different ways and everytime Ive used it, it pills up immeditaly even with no other product and others that are also water based. * Have complained about packaging previously -- the convex bottom cap will not sit upright on shelf / counter. Then I couldn't access any product from the pump / tube so I returned it for an in-store replacement. This tube feels light weight-wise, but I am able to pump product out of tube. Suggest you return to previous packaging that had no issues. Meanwhile I'm looking around for a replacement. * Perfect sunscreen.  Lightweight yet moisturizing. * I used my sister's.  I really liked it.  Easy to use, it didn't leave a white cast, I like everything about it.  I have to buy my own now.  My sister won't let me have hers! * I have been on the hunt for months for a moisturizer with SPF that isnt overly dewy in order to skip a step in my routine and thought this might be the answer based on the reviews I read. This might work great if you wear foundation daily or are under 30 with no texture, and yes this doesnt feel greasy or oily BUT it makes me look greasy and oily. I only spot conceal on most days and when I use this I have to put powder on my face because it makes me look so shiny, and the powder doesnt really stick in areas i dont have makeup on. For the price I really dont think i will keep it."

I was trying popular name brand skin care products that left my skin super dry and within seconds of having a small application … I could actually feel my skin hydrating. Soft and smooth and smells nice too. Love this product and recommend to my friends and family. * I bought this and absolutely love it!! I will definitely buy it again!! * Each day i used it, i felt it burn my face as i put it on. It also didn't go with my primer and other products i use * Heavy and stucky, made my skin itchy.. Heavy fragrance. I wanted to love this so much. Very overpriced 
Miss my moisturizer that was discontinued for what reason why??? * goes on heavy at first, but quickly turns lightweight as it soaks into and hydrates your skin. Only downfall is the price. * Amazing and so hydrating! * WHY DID THEY DISCONTINUE CHANEL HYDRA BEAUTY CREME RICHE? THEY REPLACED WITH WITH A CHEAPER VERSION THAT HAS GREASY LITTLE MICROBEADS IN IT? WHY WHY WHY?"

I really enjoy the product and like my skin doesn't feel super greasy. My only minor issue, is the smell is a bit odd for me, it's very tolerable it's just a bit odd for me. Also, this is better suited for summer time and warmer climates and can feel a bit drying in the winter so just be aware of that as well. But overall great product * Love this product, I have been using it for 2+ years. No scent, lightweight, absorbs well. I love this gel moisturizer. * I thooght id like this lighter gel facial moisturizer because i habe pretty pily skin bit ots jist notnfor me. Ive been using prodicts to help ansorb oil and actually need a PM moisturizer bit this one does not do the trick amd atill leaves my fave feeling dry at night. I think i will ne switching bavk to the  Dermalogica skin smooyhing moisturizer afyer im done with this bottle. * this keeps my skin hydrated. its great for the oily places on my face. * Great for oily, acne prone skin. It's very lightweight + smells good (even though it's not a scented product). The packaging isn't the most aesthetic but that doesn't stop it from being an amazing product! You can also get this product in their acne clearing kit, along with a foaming face wash and spot treatment. Love it! * Got this moisturizer as a wake me up for the cooling effect, but the amount of product doesnt even cross the verticle E in ""clear"" written on the front of the bottle. Highly disappointed because had i noticed before using it, I would have returned it. * As someone that's been struggling with finding a good moisturizer for my oily skin I am very impressed I struggle with oily skin so bad and it his moisturizer doesn't leave a shine and controls the oil :)"
277,pacifica,vegan collagen every day lotion spf 30,pimprod2017151,2566493," * We accidentally ran out of this, and we will never take this product for granted again! * It was just too greasy it started to break my skin out * I generally love Pacifica and have only purchased vegan/cruelty free products for the past 30 or so years. My usual store didn't have Andalou SPF face lotion anymore, which I've used religiously and happily for many years, and this was the closest alternative. I have never had a bad reaction to any lotion but this one irritates my eyes horribly, to the point of not being able to drive safely and having to wash my face and flush my eyes. Do not recommend! * I love this brand and I was excited to find a daily moisturizer from them with spf and even went through several bottles but I had to stop using it because it caused my eyes to burn and water profusely. I would also add that it has a very oily finish, so if you have oily or combo skin, this likely isn't for you. * I've used this through a couple of bottles. My skin takes time to adjust to products (hence why the couple of bottles). 

I love that it is cruelty free and has vegan collagen. I love that it has SPF 30, a must for me, BUT it smells like sunscreen. It is definitely moisturizing, I don't have an issue with dry skin, BUT it's rather greasy. My daughter has even commented that my face is really greasy when I wear it (not really the vibe I'm going for). The chemicals burn my eyes as the day goes on. If I even wipe my eyes, it takes me minutes to wipe away whatever traces of this moisturizer is around my eyes. If I regularly wore makeup, this would be extra problematic. If you wear contacts, I do not recommend this. Imagine that burning getting caught up under your contacts.

I really, really wanted to love this because I didn't want to go through having my skin adjust to a new product, but I can't justify it based on it being a habit. * As mentioned by others, this would be more accurately described as ""SPF 30 sunscreen with collagen."" Smells exactly like a normal drugstore sunscreen. It's light and doesn't feel too greasy (but there is still a bit of that feeling). Overall it's ok * Just finished my bottle and ordered another one.  I have sensitive, adult cystic acne, 44 yr old skin that is in the normal to dry stage. This product:
1) has a sunscreen like feel to it when you first apply it, then it fades away
2) has a great glass bottle that you can get ALL of the product out of!
3) Spreads well- at little goes a long way- to much will make it sticky and it won't dry down fast
4) plays well with Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid serum and PUR love your selfie foundation."
278,clarins,extra-firming & smoothing night moisturizer,pimprod2031267,2592833," * This was recommended to me by an employee. I have never used clarins before so I took a leap of faith. Big mistake. 

It does nothing for my skin… super greasy, no firming, and makes my skin look worse. For the price I expected at least a decent product. In my opinion there are SO many great moisturizers out there that out perform this and are cheaper. * Bought this because I like the day cream version a lot.  This however was just not a great formulation for me.  It simply NEVER absorbs into my skin and then it just rubs off on my pillow case or hands eventually.   And I don't use an excessive amount because of the price tag.  I'm a big fan of using the minimal amount required.  It's too late to return it, so it's just going to move into my graveyard of products that I can't bare to throw away because, $$$, but just don't work on my skin.  Le sigh.  But, I still love the extra firming day cream and all my other Clarins products.  I would recommend trying a sample of this before buying if possible so you know if it's a good consistency for your skin. * Excellent result 👍 * Light weight, non greasy.  Plant enriched.  Vegan.  Long lasting.  Eco friendly packaging. * Really recommend this line for girls after 50. I feel my face firming after second week and continue improving. * This product is amazing!"

It also went bad pretty quickly and started to smell like pungent onions (no smell initially). * Great intro to retinol. I have sensitive, acne prone, oily skin. This did not irritate my skin, and honestly it has improved my acne. My skin has never looked better with Cosrx and i've been struggling with my skin since middle school. I am now 26. * This stuff is GOLD. I had never used retinol and read that a small percentage is the best way to start and wow. Every night I put this on my skin is instantly dewy, glowy, and looks so fresh. It's been a game changer in my skin care routine"

But the product is hydrating but does not reduce redness as much as i hoped it would. * Helps SO much with redness from sun damage! * I Have Used This Toner For Over 5 Years & I Have Loved It. Its The Only Toner I Go Back To Because In Its First Use You Can See The Dirt That Is Removed From Your Face & In Every Use. You Can Visually & Physically Feel/Tell The Difference When Using This Product. I Like To Add Some Into A Spray Bottle & Then Remove Excess With A Cotton Pad. This Also Helped Me Years Back When I Was Having A Long Going Acne Breakout. I Have Not Had Any Problems With This Product & Will Continue Using. * I did not find this product to be soothing. Instead of reducing redness it seemed to make my skin more red. It left my skin feeling sticky instead of moisturized. My skin is a little sensitive, but i dont usually have to stop using products without finishing them. * I have mild rosacea. I am not consistent in my skincare routine, I will get some surface acne.   I implemented it into my current routine and used it consistently for 3 months. After about 6 weeks, I tried some variations to ensure that there wasn't interaction with what I was using. It did not exacerbate redness or irritate; however it also, did nothing else. The earthy smell dissipates as it dries. Nothing changed  I would not waste my money in the future on this particular product. * I have rosacea and this product helps to soothe redness and prevent further reactivity. It feels good on the skin and smells great."
281,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial advanced repair barrier cream,pimprod2036682,2603779," * Good but expensive and not much product!! * Pricey for the small amount you get but it definitely feels amazing and a little goes a long way!! * This product has helped save my skin! Wearing the mask during Covid killed my skin barrier and I have not been able to revive it. Every product I have tryed has given me cystic acne or i have had a horrible reaction to it. And just when I thought all hope was lost this 💎 was recommended to me. I was a little weary as its a cream and feels like a balm. I am oily to combo and anything thick just make we more oily. This absorbs great as long as you dont over use it so find your sweet spot. Start out with a little cuz it goes a long way. This helps Hydrate my skin while I useing active to clear it up my breakouts. * While it does feel nice initially when you put it on that fades quickly and just makes my face feel tight. Absolutely not worth the price point. There are more hydrating options out there. * I have dry, sensitive skin & this cream has been a game changer for my skin. I love that this balm doesn't have shea butter like most balms because i suffer from acne & cannot use that ingredient on skin. This cream has cleared my acne (i assume because it has salicylic acid) & my skin just looks & feels so much healthier. I love it so much, but like someone else said in the comments…I wish they made a bigger size because i go through this stuff so quick since i use it day & night. * I have extremely dry skin. It's very sensitve and reactive due to an autoimmune disease. I can use hardly anything on my face. I use and like the Kiehl's cica but thought this would be better with the colder temps now. It's not. Skin is dryer and I can tell my skin barrier is unhappy now. It reminds me of using body lotion on your face (which I've tried a few times) it leaves a chalky matte finish too. Not good for my middle aged skin. 
Their Cica cream is far superior and so is anything by Ursa Major for all you out there with unhappy dry skin. This doesnt cut it as a facial lotion. * This is vry healing on my dry skin. It gave me a couple of whiteheads on my face, but I noticed that it really calmed the redness. It's a trade-off. I would rather cover a pimple with a little makeup rather than cover up the redness all over my face."

I've not only purchased the entire live for myself but family members and it's worth every penny. A LITTLE goes a long way! * The best face cream I have ever used. * This face cream was so expensive and I felt it didn't work for me. It made my face very sensitive and my foundation didn't stay well on top it. I was disappointed but will try something new. * I am loving the results of these products. * I've tried MANY MANY moisturizers. this one is THE BEST hands down! Use it day 1 and your face feels like a babys butt the very next day. That's how fast and amazing this stuff works. Nothing will make your skins feel this soft and supple. And no breakouts! (a few moisturizers make me break out for some reason but not this) The only downside is the price; it's horrendously expensive so I hafta wait until my bday & xmas gift cards and rewards points to buy it so I only buy it about once a year. A little goes along way so I can make it last a few months. I'm 56 with normal to dry skin. * I have used it for a week now. Like the way my skin feels I use it at night. Packaging is a little over the top. Contents is a lot smaller than it appears from the outside.

This is the first primer that i have used that doesn't leave my face looking dry & patchy after using foundation & powder. It also is very cooling so be careful around your eyes. It's also very good for sensitive skin & hasn't caused acne tk break-out. The only reason I'm taking a star off is because I don't really see any difference with my pores.

I do like it, I can feel how it seems to be tightening my skin.. But, i havent noticed any difference. I have noticed at the very top where my hair line is, it gets super dry. I am not sure if it is the moisturizer or what but i have tried several different shampoos and conditioners and still have the problem. But i havent tried a different moisturizer yet. The smell does not bother me, it does smell good. I do feel like it isn't as moisturizing as it should be though… I really wish I could find the old Chanel Hydra Micro Creme! 

Honestly, I believe this moisturizer just depends on your skin type. I use it with my Chanel foundation.. I am still iffy about it because I feel like it also shows my ""fine lines"" more but I am not very good with all of this anyway.

This lotion promises a lot—gentle exfoliation, brightening effects, and hydration—all while being safe for sensitive and acne-prone skin. 

By the end of the week, my skin looked more even-toned, and some of my dark spots had started to fade. The gentle exfoliation from the lactic acid helped in renewing my skin without causing any irritation or redness—a common issue I face with more aggressive exfoliants. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid exceeded my expectations! This dynamic blend of lactic acid and vitamin C not only brightens my complexion but also gently exfoliates. My skin feels smoother and looks more radiant. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula makes it ideal for use under makeup. This lotion has swiftly become one of my top choices for achieving a glowing, healthy appearance. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C is perfect for my normal to dry skin. It also brightens and evens out my skin. I love to apply it when my legs are out for a natural glow! * Looking for bright and radiant skin? Look no further! The lightweight moisturizing lotion contains 7% lactic acid for gentle exfoliation and Vitamin C for skin that will look glowy and fresh! My skin looks smoother and softer after just a few days! * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid is a staple especially for the Summer. I'm always on the hunt for some sort of vitamin c lotion. Since we have hard water that can be so tedious. Not only does it help repair my skin but I also get to brighten my skin at the same time. * I'm a big fan of the AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid AHA! This product truly brings out the radiance in my skin with its brightening formula that gives me a nice glow. I already own a few AmLactin products, but this one stands out to me because of its amazing scent – a lovely hint of cocoa that I adore. I believe this ingredient plays a part in maintaining the health and glow of my skin. I've noticed that the Vitamin C in this lotion is really working on evening out my skin tone and keeping it super smooth!"

300,olay,regenerist vitamin c + peptide 24 hydrating moisturizer,pimprod2027778,2586031," * After 1st small application my face began to burn. I had to wash it off. Returned it to the store. This one is not for me but Olay doesn't make it easy to know which one of their products to use. * I purchased this moisturizer from Ulta and it arrived within a few days. I use the product both morning and evening even if I am supposed to only use it once a day. My skin appears brighter and it is definitely smoother. I even use it on my neck but so far I haven't noticed a difference there. * This smooths my face and doesn't cause breakouts which so many moisturizers do. I haven't found a moisturizer yet that doesn't break me out. It lasts all day and works well underneath your makeup or by itself. I definitely plan on continuing to use this. * A couple months back I went on vacation to the Bahamas where my skin ended up breaking out very badly.  I brought this moisturizer with. It felt like my face was burning off and every time I took a shower more skin peeled off my face. It was the most miserable time ever. I assumed it had something to do with the trip. A couple days ago I tried this product again, the next morning the same thing happened, immediately this time. My face is burning, feels hot to the touch, bright red and is breaking out with little bumps all over and starting to do that gross oozy thing again. Now I realize it's this moisturizer. It might be awesome on some, just not me. I really wanted to like this product but I wouldn't wish this horrible reaction on anybody. So I guess just be cautious and if you notice something doesn't feel right, stop using it immediately. * This stuff isnt just great for your face, but can work on other sensitive areas too. I had dark marks/hyperpigmentation left behind from a medical adhesive left on my thigh too long, and this genuinely helped to fade those lines to a point where they are less noticeable * I love the way this smells. I use it in the mornings, a little hint of citrus smell is nice to give you a little wake up. Goes on a little sticky, but drys smooth and soft. Definitely recommend. * I've been a licensed esthetician for over 5 years and also an Ulta employee. I got this as a gift for the holidays and had no interest in trying it. I'm such a skincare snob. Well, I tried it. I absolutely love this moisturizer. I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear it because I'm glowing."
301,chanel,hydra beauty camellia water cream illuminating hydrating fluid,pimprod2029968,2544825," * Absolute favorite! Feel complete with it. * I use this before my foundation and I get so many compliments about how my face looks as soft as a baby! It truly makes my face feel soft and look better than ever with makeup, I don't look cakey. I use this with a water-based mac foundation and set with a charlotte tilburry powder. * 1st time I purchased this.  Great for Arizona summers. * Nice light not too heavy. Light scent. Does not irritate my sensitive skin. Calming. Definitely a favorite face cream. * I bought this and absolutely love it!! I will definitely buy it again!! * I have acne rosacea along with endometriosis, so my skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and breakouts so easily. I have tried every moisturizer from the drugstore to my dermatologist prescriptions, and nothing, I mean nothing has compared to this. this has not made my face itch, burn, or breakout. it actually took away about 90% of my redness in the first 24 hours i used it. i never thought Chanel would be my life line, but its now my holy grail. if you are truly sensitive, and not just ""sensitive"" like the majority of women say and they use like Cerave on their skin, but seriously have sensitive skin, try this out. you wont be disappointed. id rather pay more for quality ingredients than anything from a drugstore. * I have been a hardcore Charlotte Tillbury Magic Cream fan. I started using tretonin so it was suggested I use this moisturizer before and after applying the tretonin. I absolutely love it. It's extremely moisturizing and smells amazing. My face is very dry but after using this it feel so soft and smooth. It's kind of small for the price but I love it so much I will suck it up."
302,vichy,minÃ©ral 89 fragrance free cream,pimprod2039914,2613655," * Yes, I know the packaging isn't sexy or exciting. And no, this product probably isn't trending on Tiktok at the moment. However, this is one of the absolute best and most luxurious face creams I've ever used, and at a desirable price point. It leaves my cracked, painful and psoriasis-prone face plump, dewy, glowy and hydrated for the entire day or night. It performs better than the majority of my high end brand creams do and is extremely gentle. Highly recommend trying. * It moisturizes my skin too much! It looks great under makeup, you wake up as if you had just washed your face, I love it! Super moisturizing. * I am of the darker persuasion in her late 30s and it is hard to find a moisturizer that does not over power you with the smell. But this, this one is lovely. It goes on like butter ladies. Trust me it blends well with other products too. * This cream smells like the airplane cabin bathroom pink hand soap, which is slightly offputting. It also feels thick and heavy without seeming to sufficiently moisturize my face, so I think this formula just isn't for me."
303,cetaphil,healthy renew purified peptides broad spectrum spf 30 day cream,pimprod2041297,2611322," * This absorbs nicely and I think it's working. * Feels heavy and uncomfortable.Definitely not suitable for acne prone/oily skin.If you have dry skin this is for you. It leaves a beautiful glow and deeply hydrates but again, not for oily skin or if you leave in hot weather.Too heavy for a day cream * I got this product with high hopes. It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy. I don't like the packaging, but i've noticed a lot of brands going this route so its whatever. I would recommend it though."

All around my face and under chin. My money just went to waste. SO DISAPPOINTED * It really makes my skin look like glass! Would love to try the mist also * As other reviewers said it causes little white pumps on my t zone area and it doesn't do anything. * This product is very moisturizing I have been using this for 2 weeks and it's amazing * not a bad moisturizer but not the greatest either. its great for warmer weather since its lightweight and doesnt make your skin greasy. the moisture doesnt last all day through the colder weather though. * not a bad moisturizer but not the greatest either. its great for warmer weather since its lightweight and doesnt make your skin greasy. the moisture doesnt last all day through the colder weather though. * I was looking for a hydrating moisturizer that would not leave my skin looking oily but I'm still seeing some dryness around my problem areas

I'm not a fan of the aluminum tube it comes in but that's not a deal breaker for me. Run to buy this! * This PM Hydration to rebuild and protect your bodies best defense, your skin barrier is incredible! I have very sensitive skin and so many issues with my skin from aging, etc and  this night cream is the answer. My spouse Loves it and uses it too! * Great price point, and appealing ingredients for my skin type. I don't know why, but it seems to sap water out of my skin. Long term use gave me dryness and temporary wrinkles. It might be due to my climate. * So moisturizing and i have noticed a huge difference in my skin when i wake up, softer and clearer. I have oily acne prone skin and I've experienced no breakouts or excess oil during the day. * I got this whole line on a whim and i can definitely say its healed my skin barrier and got rid of my acne. This stuff goes on smooth and feels so good on my face, i wake up very refreshed, the spf in the morning version is a plus. Thank you ROC🧡😁 * I've been struggling with adult acne for about 2 years now. One of the things I've learned is if your skin barrier is shot - you're not going to heal your acne. This product has significantly improved my skin for the better. It truly does what it says: improves skin barrier. It also will help heal a breakout literally overnight which is amazing! * Been using it at night after my HA application and waking up with silky soft skin with faded blemish appearance. Will buy again."

I haven't used it long enough to notice if it helps with wrinkles but I will let you know later. Some moisturizers feel sticky when you put it on, this one does not. It also has a nice smell to it. * I have been using this Hydrating cream for over one year now. I like how it works and how it makes my skin feel. * found this product on sale and thought I would give it a try, and so far, I really like it - feels nice and haven't had any bad reactions, nice find * Wow! I was blown away by how effective this max hydration cream by ROC is! When you first apply this you can feel it deeply hydrating your skin. It's fast absorbing and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. After about a week of use i started to notice a slight reduction of my visible fine lines and wrinkles. After about 3 weeks to a month of use I have much firmer skin. This cream is amazing! 
Contains Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol for maximum results. Dermatologist tested. Paraben free. Non comedogenic. Non irritating and fragrance free. 
I received this product free from Roc & PinchMe. * So gar I'm enjoying the  line smoothing max hydration cream. It's a bit thicker than I anticipated but it's creamy enough the it goes on smooth. After just a few days I noticed how hydrated my skin feels. I can't wait to see what the future holds in continuing this product.  Because I sure need it. Retinol these lines honey.. retinol these lines lol. Thanks ulta * ١like the effectiveness, moisturizing, and skin softness of the product. They mention it works well, leaves their faces feeling hydrated, and is the absolute best moisturizer they have ever tried. Some appreciate wrinkle reduction and the skin look. However,I have reported that the product can irritate sensitive skin and burn their eyes. Opinions are mixed on the scent and value for money. * Love the feel of my skin after putting this on. It's feel so soft."

I dont Understand why skincare companies think they need to add such strong fragrance to their products. Will be returning this product. * I started using this about a month ago and I love it! So this will now be two of their skincare products I really like and does the job. And again, affordable! I use it in my morning routine and feels great! Goes on smooth and light weight. I would recommend! * I just bought this came home put it on and instantly got a headache from the strong perfume smell. It's like they dumped a whole bottle of floral old lady perfume in this moisturizer. I looked at the ingredients and it actually says perfume and that shouldn't be in a face moisturizer. Returning this immediately * I used it for the first time a month ago … my skin is glowing    It looks firmer and I definitely will buy again * I dont know what it is about this product but even if it is the onky thing I wear that day it atill peels and clumps on my skin after it dries.

VERY good for moisturizing before doing your makeup. I live in Boston but also part in Florida and this product does not fail me. * I really wanted to love this. It smells amazing, it goes on feeling really nice and moisturizing. a little goes a long way. But the dry down is where it gets bad. it feels tacky and sticky and a weird gritty feeling that i just can't get past. It's hard to really describe but i just know i do not like how my skin feels after using this. I can't decide if i want to return it immediately or give it a chance for a week. It was a lot of money to spend to not love a product i use twice a day. * There's something about this that just feels a little luxurious. I purchased this on a black Friday sale otherwise I don't think I would've spent the money. Now that I've used it I will definitely repurchase in the future, even at the regular cost because I think it is worth it. I have oily skin and most moisturizers leave my skin oily because they are just too thick and creamy. This moisturizer is very thin and watery and glides on your face very smoothly and doesn't leave me feeling oily. I'm also a big fan of the rose smell. * this product is incredible!so glowy and hydrating!! also feels so luxurious! * I love that it's not greasy. I have acne prone skin and it doesn't make me break out. * Love this moisturizer!

313,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial moisturizer spf 30,pimprod2002927,2536697," * A great product. * This may be a decent moisturizer for winter or indoor not sweating use. Do not use for outdoor activities. It will burn your eyes SO badly. I don't have sensitive eyes or skin but I was practically blind on a summer hike. Horrible! I expect more from a brand like this. * I do have to say I only just tried this product so I'm unsure if it will break me out in the future. However it feels lovely on my skin. Before I applied this product I had some slight dry patches on my skin and it noticeably reduced the dryness. It didn't leave any white cast on my skin (I do have very fair skin though) and it made my skin looks very dewy and glowing! I would definitely recommend this product :) * I really do not understand the bad reviews. This is a great moisturizer with SPF in it. I personally like an all in one product and with 4.2 ounces you get a good value for your money. Not only does this have great ingredients, it is hydrating, sinks into your skin very easily, doesn't leave a white cast, and does not make your eyes burn. My skin glows after applying and it also wears SO well under makeup!! I do not find this sunscreen to be greasy at all. It actually makes me less oily throughout the day compared to the other SPF moisturizer I was using previously. I was using the Cerave AM lotion but wasn't in love with it as it took a lot of TLC to blend in and made my makeup pill. I was recommended this product by a friend and I am so glad I bought this. For those concerned about fragrance I notice a very very slight sunscreen smell but it doesn't bother me and I am someone who is sensitive to scents. This is a chemical sunscreen so some people may be sensitive to that. I am someone who isn't. I prefer chemical sunscreens anyway because they usually do not leave a white cast and are more hydrating. Mineral sunscreens are always too drying for my skin and leave too much of a whitecast. * I love this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I just love how it applies and how moisturized my skin feels afterwards. * It's ok. Def more of a sunscreen feel. Doesn't leave a white cast but takes a while to soak in. I have to wait quite awhile before I can begin applying my makeup. Like a lot of Kiehl's products but won't buy this one again. * I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now and I swear by it. I put it on in the morning before applying my makeup and it works perfectly. I've found that some moisturizers make my foundation look kinda wonky, but my makeup goes on top of this one nicely. Also, I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this product. I'm never going back!"

My dermatologist gave me a sample of the Cetaphil cream and I love it. I repackage it in a squeeze bottle for easier application. * I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin and this moisturizer is great! It is truly frangrance free: no chemical smell, just completely neutral. It is not greasy and it absorbs quickly. I like that it's in a tub so there's no product wasted. * Love how it makes my skin soft . & helps my old skin with age spots & bruising * my sensitive skin gets dry over time and this helps it a lot. I am 10 years old and I live in Florida so this is a must-have * This product received the National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance, as listed on the NEA website. I passed over this product for years because the package does not include the seal. I was absolutely missing out. This jar cream is the best body moisturizer I have ever used on my eczema, dermatographia, contact dermatitis, and other skin disorders. It has absolutely helped my skin heal from flare ups as well as help prevent new ones. I do not use this on my face so I cannot speak to its effect on acne. It's comforting and relieving to know I have finally found something to mitigate the suffering. No more intense burning pain just from water or scratching until the skin is raw. This is not a beauty product to me, it's a medical necessity helping my quality of life. Be patient and give this a try, your skin will get better. * Im currently using this moisturizer along with a 10% Benzoyl peroxide cleanser and its the best. My skin type is dry but acne prone fyi. This moisturizer can be used for the face and body and my skin does not feel dry or tight, Simply moisturized."

It is already half way gone with only using it a half full of times because the lid does not lock and stay in place! Highly disappointed. * I need C10 now! * Vitamin C does wonders for your skin. I use this for daytime care in conjunction with the Redermic R in the evening. It's a great combo ! * I use Redermic C every morning as my moisturizer.  I put it on, let it stay on a few minutes to absorb, and then apply my foundation and other makeup. * I use for 1 year and my skin now looks better, my Dermatologist recommended it 👌🏼 * I used to use Dr Perricone products which are great but pricey so I read about the LaRoche line and some have gotten rewards from New Beauty Magazine. I gave it a try and I am very happy with the results ! I use Redermic R every other night and the Redermic C everyday in the morning.

The idea that it helps to brighten the skin without Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) won me over. I find Vitamin C can be too aggressive on my skin. * I love this moisturizer!

It has an extremely soft, lightweight texture so its great for daily, but also has so many brightening, moisturizing, and mild resurfacing properties, its also great for my evening regimen as well.

A little bit goes a long way and works great for my combination skin. * I think this is best moisturizer I've ever used and can't believe how great it makes my skin feel. I have only used it so far in the dead of winter and it makes me feel completely moisturized, like I just left a facial. I also have rosacea and sensitive skin and this hasn't bothered me at all.
