It is an amazing product. * I have used this product for over a year.  Application smoothly and boy does it feel good.  Definitely does it's job. * I love the way it makes my face feel * My daughter loves this stuff!!!! * Though this moisturizer is a bit pricey, this product is truly amazing. Ive been usikg this moisturizer for about 3 months now ans my sensitive skin has been GLOWING!! I have combination skin, and this product hydrates it all. I highly recommend this product if you have the extra cash! * Love the feel on the skin and moisture on the skin * This moisturizer is so good it sinks right into your skin and then keeps your skin moisturized for a long time goes well with any foundation.  It is a little pricey but I think it's worth it"

So hydrating💜💜 * it took me a while to decide whether or not I wanted to buy this, but once I did, I did not regret it. I highly recommend this for sensitive skin. the results are Wonderfull. * I love this overnight mask. my face is always so nicely hydrated in the morning without being oily. perfect for the dry winter months * DO NOT BUY THIS THIS BROKE ME OUT SO BAD! I EVEN GAVE IT TWO EXTRA TRIES! THIS MADE ME BREAK OUT ALL ON MY CHIN AND MY FOREHEAD I WANTED TO LIKE THIS AND ENJOY IT BECAUSE I LOVE SOME OF BUBBLES PRODUCTS LIKE MORNING RAYS BUT THIS IS JUST NOT IT I MEAN IT MIGHT GOOD FOR SOME SKIN TYPES BUT NO FOR ME! * this is so hudrating and a nice pick me up even if u have combo skin. I only use once or twice a week because it has Shea butter in it, which is kind of heavy for my skin, but it doesn't break me out * Woke up with less bumps on my face and my skin felt cleaner"

3,philosophy,hope in a jar smooth-glow multi-tasking moisturizer spf 30,pimprod2037931,2605578," * I was NOT expecting this. I loved the original Hope In A Jar. Then when I couldn't find it anymore, around 2014, I stumbled upon the Renewed Hope in a Jar, and I had actual hope. I was not pleased with it. That turned me away from Philosophy for about 10 years. Then i saw this. When I finally had the motivation to look at Philosophy again and get that beloved Hope In A Jar, I looked for it and found what I believed was IT. I washed, toned and prepped my skin for a luxurious moisturizer, and then my face immediately started burning, especially around my nose. I was not expecting this and I was definitely not welcoming this. Once I inspected the jar, i realized it was Hope In A Jar--Smooth Glow. I don't know what that ""smooth glow"" is supposed to do, but it's definitely NOT smooth OR moisturizing. * Purity is the best face wash . I've been using it for many years. It's gentle and yet cleanses thoroughly. It leaves my face clean, not dried out, and refreshed! I keep the convenient pump bottle in the shower for my daily morning face wash!  It starts me out every morning with my happy face. * Does not dry out your skin...does not contain items you don't want...no need for additional product for eye makeup removal * I got a little bottle in a sampler pack and HAD to buy the big bottle. I love the scent and my skin feels lovely and bouncy after a short time of using it. * This is pricier, but worth it! I have combo dry and oily skin, and this always leaves it feeling fresh and clean and u really don't need to double cleanse if u use this. * This truly is my skins favorite choice for a moisturizer. * I have been reading about facial serums. It seems that their usage is alleged to help firm skin, reduction of fine lines and wrinkles. It's to be utilized with s moisturizer. This particular serum has not irritated my sensitive skin. It leaves my skin feeling soft."
4,drunk elephant,protini polypeptide firming moisturizer,pimprod2028061,2588434," * Solid option—moisturizes and rich but not heavy. Absorbs easily. Goes well under makeup. Does not irritate my skin—yay! * I have never in my life found a moisturizer that contains all of the incredible ingredients this one does. Seriously, just look it up on incidecoder. I have been using this moisturizer for years, regardless of price, and will use it for the actual rest of my life if this formula never changes. Some other DE products can be hit-or-miss, but this is a true holy grail for me. * I have very sensitive skin! Big pores acne for years. I'm 38 and never use face moisturizer because I feel like since my skin is an oil pit already it was gonna make it worse but I'm in love. Soft and gentle on my skin. 2 weeks already and will continue to use . * I received this peptide gifted by Drunk Elephant to try for a couple of weeks. I've really enjoyed using it. It has a very faint smell and the peptide leaves my face feeling hydrated and soft after using it. * This moisturizer never lets me down!!!This whole brand is amazing. I highly recommend. * Why is every review of this product from a gift!?! I have been using this for a few years now and several months ago, there was a recall on the product. After the recall, I began purchasing again and the formula is not the same at all. It's heavy, doesn't absorb well and the texture is just different. It is definitely no longer worth the cost and I am looking for a replacement. * i tried to love this, since i use their lala moisturizer which is great and i also use some of their serums, however this caused me to break out badly, and i'm not a fan of the texture. its not worth the price, the lala retro cream is better"
5,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial cream with squalane,pimprod2002804,2540233," * My daughter and I love this product. We do the 30min drive to Ulta in a different town just to buy it. Definitely beats the other creams we have tried. * it broke me out really bad * I was a Peter Thomas Roth water drench cream fan for its light feel and hydration, but it's expensive. I thought this give Kielhs a try and I love it (and the lower price!). * I use to have to shave my face everyday to get all the access skin off because of my acutane making my skin dry, this moisturizer helped a lot. I was able to put on makeup with out it being patchy, it is VERYY thick and best for over night use. * Great product * Soooo I've got dry skin. This is a new thing for me as I spent 24 years having oily skin and then BAM you hit 25 and it's dry. Now I'm a black girl and if its one thing my momma taught me it was how to moisturize. I don't feel like this product does enough for it to be priced the way it is. I do not feel it offers superior moisture or leaves my skin looking better than my KPL LPS lotion. It's nice sure, feels great, but what are the real benefits that make it worth so much? I've been using this for about 6 months now and I just dont feel like it's giving me the moisture. * I love this product! Helps with break outs. I haven't broke out in months! And my face is so glowy!"

7,tula,24-7 weightless moisture day & night gel cream,pimprod2045112,2624255," * The packaging is cute. I wish they wouldn't claim they are ""clean"" because they definitely aren't. They have artificial dyes not to mention other ingredients that aren't great. I feel it would be a good amount for the price if it was made better. Oh well * Very effective, super absorbent and makes my skin feel so hydrated. I honestly love it. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The packaging was simple. I love the scent and ingredients! The scent was very nice and floral. The texture was very smooth and not sticky or greasy. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Surprisingly enjoyed this a lot! The texture is exactly what it says very much lightweight gel like formula - very similar in my opinion to the Peter Thomas Roth one but more affordable which is a huge win. Would I use it over my tatcha water cream maybe not but it will stay in rotation! Little to no scent which I enjoy * I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. 

Let's just start of by saying there is no weird smell what so over. The packing is great because I carry it with me everywhere and doesn't spell despite it's more watery like texture. This is a great moisturizer for girlys that don't like to feel sticky or oily afterwards (because this product does not do that). I would definitely purchase again. * I received this item free in exchange for my honest review. The light, gel like formula of this moisturizer is perfect for the warmer weather. It wears wonderfully under makeup without being too heavy. Leaves the skin glowing and smooth! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I love how lightweight and moisturizing this cream is. It doesn't have any harsh smells or anything. It's so good, I've been using it day and night. It has my face feeling amazing!"
8,it cosmetics,confidence in a cream anti-aging hydrating moisturizer,pimprod2033684,2598796," * Love this stuff - its my go to! * Have used this product for several years works very well keeps you face feeling smooth and keeps those lines out of your face in control.  I am over 64 years old, and have received compliments about my face complexion and  they can't believe it! * Was great at first but it give you a heavy sticky feeling after application which is weird. Usually good creams don't give you that tacky feeling and they absorb right into your pores. Then it clogs all my pores every time I use it and i get tiny bumps everywhere. I wouldn't recommend. * I tried a travel size of Confidence in a Cream to see how it reacts to my mature skin. I'm happy it is moisturizer that is gentle in my skin and I'm seeing a softer skin. Chrissy was my tech and she was amazing and quite knowledgeable about skin - even mature skin like mine. She picked out each type of makeup I was looking for and I'm looking forward to revisiting her and purchasing additional products she recommends. I'll be back to buy a full size Confidence in a Cream Anti-Aging Hydrating Moisturizer by IT Cosmetics. * I love this moisturizer for am/pm usage. The formula is rich without feeling oily. I have somewhat mature (40yo), dry skin. This product also does well under makeup. * I have used many IT products for years love what it does for me. I wait for sale and pick it up * IT Cosmetics used to have a Pink facial cream for the mature skin. I can't seem to find it anywhere. ULTA used to carry it all the time. Do they just not make it anymore?"

10,the ordinary,natural moisturizing factors + ha daily moisturizer,pimprod2007113,2551163," * Ive been using this nearly 3 weeks! I broke out in hives an i thought maybe its stress.. now i have about 15 black heads! Ive also grown 2 white heads its been a nightmare with this product!! Im going back to my Fenty Skin/Clinique * I tried this out because I needed to get away from SkinMedica Ultra Sheer Moisturizer for the price point. I have combo skin and it is sensitive to the point where something may feel nice but may also clog my pores. I am prone to oil in my t-zone. If I don't moisturize, my skin flares.

This all being said, I just started using this cream and can say it can seem thick or heavy. I would recommend you just give it a second to settle in and be absorbed because my skin eats this UP. I was prepared to return this but am hoping it is my new moisturizer!

Previously, I actually had some clogged pores from trying to use the very end of the SKM bottle. After a few days of this, they are gone! And no dry spots! My face is super soft and my t-zone is very minimally greasy. 

A little goes a long way. * Im a mua starting out and i bought this moisturizer because of the nice and hygenic packaging and the ordinary always has basic ingredients. I tried this on two different girls and both times it caused the makeup to slide off and seperate and it literally pills off like dead skin. Just no. * It is so moisturizing. It is easy to dispense and it does not irrirate my skin. You do not need to dispense a lot because a little goes a long way. * This moisturizer worked great for me. I have combo skin, my t-zone gets oily. I think this works better for the colder months (10-40 degrees) now that it is starting to get warmer (40-70 degrees) it does feel a little heavier. It feels oily in the beginning but through out the day my skins seems to absorb the product pretty well thus making the oilness go away. * This is my hg face moisturizer. I have normal-dry skin and this has never let me down. Been through several tubes of this stuff and I'll continue to purchase! * Ive been a hunt for an affordable face moisturizers and ive tried a couple and i thought i would give this one a try since Im a fan of The Ordinary but dont get this one. It doesnt even moisturises my face, it feels like it just sits on my face and i believe it does. One night i applied it and the next morning when i rinsed my face, I felt it on my hands, which no moisturizer has ever done that before. My face feels dryer when i apply this vs. not putting anything on my face."

I tried it with Ester Lauders Hydra Rescue and Patrick Ta's Foundation and it just slipped right off after two hours. I used setting powder, pressed powder, and setting powder and my t-zone got patchy. I would recommend this to people with normal to dry skin. * I have horribly dry and uneven skin due to PCOS and thyroid issues. This primer is perfect! It smooths everything out and my makeup stays on longer and is luminous and dewy as a result! I love all of my Bobbi Brown products, but this just became a new favorite! * I love It so much! It makes my makeup look flawless! * I cannot say enough of this product.  I bought the smaller size to try it out and loved it.  It's smooth going on your face.  I use a serum first then this moisturizer and primer.  Being in my 60's, it covers my fine lines and pores.  I just wait a few minutes and put on my foundation.  Goes on like butter!  Ending up buying the larger size. * Very disappointed with container and price"

13,la roche-posay,cicaplast balm b5 soothing therapeutic multi purpose cream,pimprod2018263,2570171," * I got this because the reviews said it helped with post skin treatment healing and any perioral dermatitis. I had been using topical steroids on and off for months that would clear up the issue, but it would come right back after eating something I am sensitive to. This moisturizer clears the dermatitis right up. I havent had any flare ups in awhile! * For reference, i have extremely dry and sensitive/acne prone skin- for whatever reason this seemed to have clogged my pores every time i use it my whole face develops milia (tiny pimples) everywhere…. I expected this to be better but unfortunately it is very over hyped, over priced and overall disappointing. Will not be repurchasing * I love this hand cream. It has niacinomide so it helps with oils and doesn't make your hands feel greasy. It's such a good purchase. It's a BIT expensive but like I've had mine in my bag for about 3 months and I'm just starting to run low. Live Laugh Lourve her * I damaged my skin barrier so I was red and irritated and looking for something to help soothe my skin and this worked perfectly. I was skeptical at first because it's marked toward dry skin and I'm very oily but I noticed the difference in my face almost immediately. Will continue to repurchase. * Love love the texture but it leaves a white cast. * I wish this came in a bigger tube, I love it so much. It's really thick and going on it takes a little bit to really soak in. 
I had really bad acne for awhile related to a health condition and this is 100% my nighttime recommendation for fading them. It also does an amazing job at rehydrating my skin and I use it on my hands as well when they get chapped from the dry air. * it didnt make that much if a difference in my skin, i feel like there is better products for the same price or cheaper. The tube is pretty small. i have sensitive skin and it didnt break me out. It might work better for someone who had a different skin type than me. i have combination skin"

I will say its worth it.🤷🏻‍♀️ * Smells good * It's fabulous!!! * I keep buying this. It absorbs great and causes no irritation. Just a nice daytime moisturizer. * This moisturizer is the absolute best I have used in years. Even with the SPF, which is a bonus, I would wear this around the clock. It feels like velvet going on your skin, and feels so divine. Very moisturizing without leaving behind any feeling.Absolutely so comfortable to wear. * I have been using this for 8 years i love that is a moisturizer with sunscreen and believe i apply once and never get burned. It gives your skin a health glow without looking sticky, shiny. I hope they never discontinue making. Try it you love it. My daughter also uses and she has acne prone skin and she also loves it"

At first, i would use it occasionally here and there in conjunction with my other moisturizers. I didnt notice much bit it definitely wasnt as moisturizing as others. Id always have to put another one on top. More recently, i went on a week long trip and only brought this to pack light. The more i used this, it would burn and tingle every time i put it on, throughout the day i would notice my face would be SOO tight and dry. Few days later, i developed dry flakey patches by the corner of my mouth and chin. It got so uncomfortable i had to go out and buy a new moisturizer on my trip!

Def recommend if you are in your 30's. * Lite but so much moisture * The texture/consistency/smell is top tier. 

I had gotten a full size last year, decided to try the matcha pudding one to see if I love it the same and while that one has it's place, I ultimately gave it to my mom and repurchased this cream instead. 
You can use for AM and PM but I personally only use this at night. It's perfect, I love it and HIGHLY recommend. * Ive been usung this moisturizer every day fir almkst 2 weeks now. I love how lightweight it feels for the day time and it sits well under sunscreen and make up. The smell isnt too strong either which i appreciate. I have sensitive/combo/acne prone skin and this hasnt caused my skin to break out or become irritated at all. * It must be fate. I received this product by mistake in an online order. I was told to keep it. Ok. So why not try it? Loved it so much I just bought another jar! For me it's a perfect daytime moisturizer. Primer and foundation apply more smoothly.

Issue is, after a while of daily use, my skin would feel dry; even patchy. Wouldn't wear underneath make-up, for sure. * I was using the glow watermelon and it was alright but my skin now is so soft and looks so healthy and it really glows without feeling greasy or making me look super oily"

This one, although not a dupe, is a good replacement. It leaves my skin soft, glowy, & hydrated. Be careful if you have oily skin… you only need the tiniest dime-sized amount… the jar could last you forever.

It's hard for me to find skincare products that don't pill under SPF, but this is one of the best. Great for daytime any nighttime, but if you're using at night, I would recommend adding an oil ot an occlusive like vaseline to lock the moisture in, because it does dry quickly. * I use the COSRX Snail Mucin Cleanser, Power Essence Serum, Eye Cream, and All In One Cream, combined with a Mario Badescu toner and a multitude of The Ordinary treatments to form a personalized and highly effective skin care regimen that has made my skin look and feel tighter, firmer, healthier, and younger. On days when I'm in a rush, the Snail Mucin line is my go-to and is effective on its own, but combined with a few Ordinary products, it's the most amazing skin care regimen I have ever used. This moisturizing cream does have a very unique texture when you first apply it, but it is far and away the best!! It tightens, firms, moisturizes, and protects!

Worth the money on a per ounce basis when compared to many drug store brands and consistently works well with my skin, especially when on retinol. And I love that they have two other weights of moisturizers for when I'm not testing my skin barriers last nerve! * Lovr this stuff. Loggteright but actually moisturizes. Would buy again * It is easy to use.  A little goes a long way, so you don't have to use a lot.  It makes my face feel good, not greasy or tight. * I've used this moisturizer for years.  I'm 65+ and this really hydrates and rejuvenates so well!  I love this product. * I was trying to upgrade my skincare routine with a daytime product that could also serve as a face sunscreen. Since I was already using Dermalogica eye cream, it made sense to look at their other products. I don't know how I ended up with this. Not what I expected and certainly not worth what I paid. I guess I'll use it as a night cream."

It does pill quite eaisy. I would also say it's not the best option for sensitive skin, as it made mine have red patches. * I've used this product for a few years now. Not only does my extremely sensitive skin love it, it is rated excellent by apps that rate beauty products by the healthfulness of the ingredients. * Excellent moisturizer for my combination skin.

Does anyone know if Ulta has old stock formula they have purchased recently? I tried to find question section. So purchase if they have original * In my constant quest for skincare products that deliver real results, I recently tried the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid. This lotion claims to gently exfoliate, boost cell turnover, and provide deep hydration to uncover softer, smoother skin. Let's dive into my experience with this multi-tasking formula.

The lotion is non-greasy and lightweight, making it perfect for daily use. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and hydrated without any heavy residue. The product is fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for those with sensitive skin or a sensitivity to strong scents. The natural smell from the lactic acid salts is subtle and varies slightly depending on your skin's unique pH, but it's not overpowering or unpleasant. * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is revolutionary! It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy!"
32,dermalogica,skin smoothing cream moisturizer,pimprod2000019,2536765," * I love this moisturizer. My esthetician suggested I use this to balance my combination skin, and it has been really helpful! It's definitely a better option than the benefit porefessional I was using before. * This is a fine moisturizer but my skin is no smoother after 9 months of daily use. Probably not worth the price. * I'm very impressed with how long my face stayed moisturized. All night! Wish it was more affordable however * This product makes my skin look soooo smooth. It is not greasy at all and my makeup goes on top of it perfectly. * This moisturizer works good for me. I am extremely oily and it's more like a lotion and it leaves my skin soft and supple and it brightens my skin which is dull. * I've only been using this product for about a week and bought thr travel size to try it out, but I can tell already my skin has never felt and looked better! For about over a year I have been struggling with my face (ezcema, acene, other dry spots, discoloration) and Cerave products were my holy grail, until it wasn't, since then I have tried numerous products, spent $$$$ and nothing work. For the last 3-4months I have been using La Roche Posay face wash & face moisturizer and its been blah. I have only been using it bc i refused to try something else and spend more money. Finally, my sister suggested Dermalogica and OMG!! All this time I had been suffering. I bought the travel size to test it out bc the full size are pricey, but let me tell you, I don't care they are expensive anymore. I have already purchased the full size products and have a full regimen for my facs. Like I said, 

I've only been using the face mositurizer, face wash, the blue bottle exfoliter (twice a week), and the brightening kit (only at night) (all travel size) and my face looks & feels amazing. 

These are expensive products, but theres a spanish saying ""lo bueno cuesta"", in english ""the good things cost"" and with these products, I can agree. Also, a little bit really goes a long way. For the face wash, I only use a pea size and its really more than enough and prettu much same off all other products. * It moisturized my face so good. Unfortunately, i cant stand the bad smell…its so bad!"

Soon as i stop using it, my skin calms down. Now i stay away from hyaluronic acid products. For moisturizing * I love this moisturizer! It is luxurious on my skin. I wish it was so freaking expensive. I purchase the refill to fit in my original glass jar. I get soo many compliments on my skin i look like I just had a facial. The glow is the best in the west. I have not found anything that compares. Splurge and give it a try. It is a thicker cream, but absorbs beautifully into skin. I would give a good estimate that a 1.7oz container lasts me about 3 months using it once a day, sometimes two. * this makes my skin feel like a flipping new- norn baby! (and their bottom) it has a delectable  scent and my skin eats this up and up and up and up over and over again! love! * Does it do what it's supposed to do? Yes. 
Does it do it better than a drugstore brand? Absolutely not. 
It smells like my grandmother, which could be a ""pro"" for some but not for me. Very ""Old Rose"" scented. 
I would not purchase this again.
It's just Meh * So much improvement in my face and neck.  Also the back of my hands. * This product makes my skin so soft, so supple and hydrated! Highly highly recommend. A little pricey but so worth it! * These product smells like natural skin care. I did not check the ingredients, though. It feels rich and luxurious. You do not need a lot to cover your entire face which helps with the price tag. I think it's nice & moisturizing! It pairs beautifully with the corresponding serum."

I love it so much, I bought one for my mother well! * After 1 month of use this is NOT for me. I have DRY mature skin so I am use to applying a thicker, richer formulation but this one just doesn't spread well. After 1 month no difference. I am disappointed because of the cost, have had better results with less expensive creams, of which I will go back too. Also I wish I could upload a picture I took of a big gap in the container, it's an air pocket therefore product is missing. * Love the creaminess of the moisturizer. * I have purchased this before, and it does not feel greasy and makes your skin very soft. * It keeps my skin supple and looking younger than my years. I think.  Love it! * I'm a big fan of Estee Lauder and to purchase this cream for half price was a no brainer. Wish this would happen more of her products.

I finished up my existing skin care items and decided to add the serum and moisturizer to replace what i ran out of. I have only used these products for a week, and they were the only things to change about my routine, and this morning i woke up to my face being swollen and itchy, a rash forming, and the skin surrounding my lips and my lips themselves being so unbearably dry and painful. If you have sensitive skin and are looking to try a new brand, I don't recommend these at all. I had to take some Benadryl just to help calm the reaction down. * I purchased the smaller size to test it out and ended up loving it.  I love that it's water based & gel like.  It's not heavy but is moisturizing. I gave it one star because it doesn't have SPF in it, but they do offer a separate product with SPF. * The packaging is awful. The pump never pumped anything so I took it off and there was no straw attached to it at all. Now I have to smack the bottle on my palm to get anything to come out. Not worth the month since I can't get all the product out. The product itself is great. * I've repurchased this because its excellent. Hardly has a scent and is non-irritating for my acne-prone skin. My only gripe is its not really suitable for under makeup because it goes on slightly tacky, so I took off one star for that. * I was bery exited to use this product, it was not a gel moisturizer like I planed, it was a ""gel like "" moisturizer that is too heavy for warm temperatures * This moisturizer is the best! I have sensitive combination skin and this has worked so well. * I was a little scared by the packaging that it might have a strong chemically smell or irritate my skin. I was thankfully wrong! I have the most extremely sensitive and acne prone skin, and omg I was so happy I found this product!

I had a sample of this from an ulta free gift promo and my lord this saved my face so fast. I didn't have the watery experience but maybe because mine was a sample it was produced more recently. at first it went on like a white zinc cream and I was like oh lawd no, but then after a couple minutes it dissolved into almost an aquaphor like texture. my skin absorbed about 90% of the product and the rest sits like a protective barrier. my skin feels so much better. I'm definitely getting a full size this is top notch stuff. * this is the most amazing cream you could ever use, i know its watery, but this water is beneficial!! 
my skin feels so soft and hydrated * The cream and liquid separated. Ive tried shaking to mix back together but doesnt work. * This cream is perfect for barrier repair and good for all skin types, however, it is a well known issue that the product in each and every tube is separated. It was rare for me to actually go into a ulta store and find one that wasnt separated. 

Tips for purchasing: make sure to buy it in stores as you are able to shake the box to check if the tube is separated. If you shake it and hear water, do not buy! 

Another tip is there is a fix. Set the item in warm water for 5 minutes, take it out and massage the tube, place it back in for another 5 minutes and repeat. There will no longer be a separation issue but the cream night have a blue tint, which alot of ppl are afraid of. * I have tried multiple topical antibiotics for 4 weeks for my perioral dermatitis and nothing has helpled. I bought this 6 days ago and has dramatically improved the irritation. Also, I never do reviews so IYKYK * I purchased this product after trying for about a month to get rid of a rash that I now know is perioral dermatitis. I tried several products and everything irritated my skin and made it worse and it actually made my dermatitis spread even more across my face. When I tried the cicilfate It burns at first just like a tingling sensation, but I trusted the reviews and I leathered it on and left it on almost 24/7. I was able to get it completely off of my face in about a week of constant use. I will say the smaller package is a lot less watery than the big one the big one has a lot more water, but the benefits outweigh the packaging issues. 100% recommend anybody with these facial dermatitis problems. Try it don't combine out with anything else. Only use this and I think it's what I would recommend to anyone with these issues."

While it has a nice texture and the ingredients look fabulous, this cream resulted in the worst allergic reaction I've ever experienced. After two uses, my skin was visibly red, tingly, textured, and incredibly itchy. Unfortunately think this damaged my barrier as my skin is still recovering using other tried and tested products. If you have sensitive skin, I'd skip. * Oh how I wanted to love this. The ingredient list looks nice, and I'd heard good reviews, but unfortunately this cream just did not work out for me. I have no idea what's causing it, but this moisturizer somewhat burns my skin every time I apply it. It also seems to be making my facial eczema worse. The texture is different, more of a whipped consistency, but still hydrating. I feel like my skin might need more moisture though. It's also expensive for what it is. Unfortunately it's too late for me to return it, and since it was pricey I'm going to use it up anyways, but I would not repurchase. Honestly you can find many just as good-if not better face creams out there with similar ingredients, that cost much less. * Made skin dry and itchy, not moisturizing. * I use this over the mad hippie super A serum, at night before I go to work. And I love this product. I don't use it twice a day but you probably could if you wanted to. This also feels like a rich moisturizer after I use the mad hippie enzyme scrub, it just makes my skin feel wonderful. I have acne prone skin and also wanted something good for anti aging, since 30 was approaching. * I wanted to love this product. I wanted a night cream with collagen & this has mostly good reviews. But the morning after the 1st time using it, I had 2 huge red zits (which is unlike my normal skin). Every time I use it, I break out the next morning. * Love how soft this cream makes my face feel!

This product is definitely not the one for me. * This product always peels on my face, whether I use it on its own or with other products. * I love it * This was the opposite of a moisturizer for me.

I only need to blot once a day at work instead of three! * I have used FAB products before. Always liked their daily moisturizer but i have oily skin so it didn't help, but this oil control moisturizer helps a lot. My skin doesn't look as shiny. Perfect product for summer. It is not heavy at all. * In my search for an oil-free moisturizer this was recommended. I used this for a month and loved it. No breakouts, controlled my oily skin and seemed to work really well. So, I stocked up and got more. I noticed something was different after the 3rd use of the new jar. I started breaking out. I haven't broken out in almost 3 years. I was confused and continued to use it because why would it start breaking me out now? I loved the first jar. I'm not sure if the formula changed or if my skin is just being finicky. 

Overall, I recommend the product because it seems to be very good. It's a struggle for us oily girls to find products that offer us a balance of hydration while keeping oil at bay. I hope it works for you if you try it :) * Ever since Neutrogena discontinued their Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin - my holy grail of moisturizers - I have been desperately searching for a replacement that will keep my breakouts under control without over-drying my skin. The search is finally over - this is it!! My skin starting clearing up and looking healthier after the first overnight application! I've now been using it for 2 months and it's continued to significantly reduce my breakouts (in frequency and duration) without drying out my skin. The only downside is that the container is about half the size I was assuming it would be, based on other FAB products I've purchased. (Although that's on me for not looking at the size printed on the front of the product.) Each container lasts me a little over 2 months with one application per day on my face and sometimes neck and/or chest. Honestly though I'm in love. * Ive used this product for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin and have used several different face moisturizers over the years and this is the only one that keeps my face from getting super shiny by the end of the day, even with serums underneath it. It WORKS so to me its worth every penny! * This is the best moisturizer I have ever found for my oily skin! I have an oily t-zone and this keeps my skin from becoming oily all day. I worked an 8-hour shift wearing this and when I got home my forehead was still dry, but not peeling, it just felt finally normal. I use this on my entire face, but keep in mind you can use it only in certain areas that you struggle with oil, so don't let other reviews about dry skin deter you. With winter coming up I may begin to only use this on my oily areas and another moisturizer on others, but this is literally the holy grail moisturizer for anyone struggling with oily skin. * I have combination skin and this has saved my skin texture and made it so soft. The consistency feels so nice and it's not overly drying even in my dry areas. Feel like it's reduced some redness as well."

The Rx Milk Moisturizer was so much better * This profuct is watery and only made my skin more dry * This is a thin/lightweight formula to begin with, but it also comes out of the pump separated and extra watery. No matter hiw mich I shake the bottle to mix it, mostly water comes out when I pimp it. Really disappointed given the price and decent reviews! * This moisturizer is everything!! The creamy lotion penitrates the face leaving it soft and radiant. I get quite a few comments ""your face is glowing"". * I think im on my fourth bottle of this moisturizer and I'm planning to buy another soon. I love the way it sits on my skin and keeps it hydrated for the whole day! And it blends so well with face oils and serums. I like to mix it with the purple nighttime serum from beekman and it leaves my skin so healthy and smooth. My only issue so far has been that the quality is not always consistent. I've had bottles that are good to the last drop, but I had one where the product started to separate about half way through and essentially became unusable. Another came to me already separated and I had to return it. It's annoying but the pros still outweigh that con for me. * Do not reccomend for sensitive skin"

48,beautycounter,countercontrol matte effect gel cream,pimprod2038172,2606559," * If you truly have oily skin, you know the difference in a review from someone with oily skin vs someone whos skin gets oily.  I have oily skin and probably spend upwards of $1K a year on products trying to find things that actually do as they claim, and this is one of them.

I was a little reluctant to purchase this as the price is pretty high for a brand I've never used, but I'm glad that I took the risk on it.  Prior to this moisturizer I was either using none at all (because most others just make me more oily, dont need redundant products on oily skin), or I was using the La-Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Matte one which didn't do much for me. Obviously how this will work for you is going to be different for everyone, and the other products you use prior to your moisturizer will make a difference as well.

For reference I am a 28 yr old female, white/Caucasian.  My morning routine is: wash with a clay based cleanser (Dermalogica), tone (Fenty Skin), hyperpigmentation serum (Good Molecules), niacinamide/zinc serum (Sunday Riley), then this moisturizer. The consistency of this product is great for oil as it is a gel based product, but it comes out more opaque white than clear which is fine. It does not have much of a fragrance that I have noticed, but I'm not sensitive to fragrance so I wouldn't be one to say. When I put this on it almost feels as if it is a crossover between a moisturizer and a makeup primer that blurs your pores.  Now it does not make your pores go away by any means, but it does HELP.  Immediately after applying my skin is definitely mattified but again, not completely shine free as if it is a primer with the sole purpose of making your skin look like it has powder on it. It does not make my skin feel tight and dried out, it genuinely makes me feel moisturized and smooth without the glowy look that normal moisturizers do. From my experience it definitely does not keep me matte for 8 hours, I would say after about 3-4 hours I start to see shine on my face to the point where I feel the need to blot if I were going out somewhere (this is all without wearing makeup or anything on top of my morning skin routine, I work from home).

If you truly have an oily/combo skin type this is not going to be your holy-grail product that makes all of your problems disappear (will continue to search for it), but if it is within your budget for a product of this type then this is 100% top 5 best moisturizers for oily skin on the market right now in my opinion after having used this for a few weeks now.  Would repurchase (and I rarely ever find products I do)!  

I also just want to throw out there that I did buy this on my own, was not asked/paid to write this, and I think this is either my only review I've ever written on Ulta or one of a few over a span of years that I don't even remember. * The packaging is very luxe but the pump feels like its empty and its still half full. It doesn't mattify anything but it is a nice mix of a gel and lotion and a lightweight moisturizer. This is an MLM and I do feel it's overpriced for what it is. It's pretty basic. * Matte effect that works great as a moisturizer/ primer for oily skin types"
49,good molecules,lightweight daily moisturizer,pimprod2023937,2582316," * I love the brand Good Molecules due to how little product I need to cover my face. The moisturizer leans on the more oily side in my opinion, but once it soaks into the skin there is no oily feeling on the skin. I find it works well under my makeup during the day as well. * I'm not sure I would describe this as ""lightweight""- it feels quite rich, but I prefer that! My skin is balanced/normal with some dryness. This product has no fragrance, works well under makeup, and unbeatable price. I love it! * Best moisturizer. Great for keeping skin plump. * No irritation and so good on my skin * I previously used a well-known face wash and moisturizer for years until I discovered that both contained endocrine disruptors, which mess with hormones. I did my research, found this brand, and gave it a try. For context, I used this mosituzer and the Good Molecules Hydrating Facial Cleansing Gel twice a day (and nothing else) and within 4 days I could tell a noticable difference! I absolutely love it and my face feels very clean and soft!! A few notes: 1) a little bit goes a long way, which makes it pretty affordable and 2) it does provide a white cast when you first put on the mosituzer, just spend the extra time to really blend it into the skin. In addition, I used to have difficult with past products making my skin oily half way through the day and I did not have that issue with this product. While I found this product to contain clean/healthy ingredients and provide amazing results, I recommend everyone do their research on the ingredients within their skincare products. * This facial moisturizer has been my go-to for over a year! It is so moisturizing, yet still lightweight feeling.  My skin looks and feels so good using this and it has never made me break out. I always make sure to have it, if I am running low you better believe I bought a backup. * I have dry, sensitive skin that's prone to rosacea and this product was fine for me. It's lightweight and absorbs into my skin quickly, but it isn't as hydrating as I need for the desert climate I live in. I could see it being good for the summer or in more humid environments."

Of all the lines I've used this is definitely my favorite. * This is the only product that I've found to keep my VERY dry skin moisturized all day. Pricey, but it works for me so I will buy again. * I've been using Moisture Surge Intense for over 5 years now. I have very dry skin due to an auto immune and this has been the only moisturizer on the market that I have found that actually moisturizes my skin. It not only gives my skin a beautiful, dewy, and hydrated look/feel, but it also blends well with most of my foundation. * Moisturizes my thirsty skin without being greasy! * I have mature skin and have been looking for something that was good for super dry skin and this has been great! * This product saved my life!!!  I'm going through menopause and my skin changed big time!  It turned into skin dryer then the Mojave desert!  Nothing was working anymore & my makeup looked terrible until I found this MIRACLE IN A JAR!!!  It saved my skin and I was able to be confident wearing my makeup again!!!  Please do not stop making this!!!  If you are a menopausal woman with extremely dry skin try this product!! It will save your life!!  It's also amazing on my dry winter hands too! * I absolutely love this moisturizer it's not to heavy but very hydrating."

At first I was using too much and it pilled on me. Using the proper amount gives all dsy hydration. * I am a devout Chanel Sublimage fan but wanted to try a ""clean"" line. This product listed shea as an ingredient as does the aforementioned. Well, my skin hasn't been clearer, pores smaller, literally no makeup other than a mineral spf. I'm stunned with the results in two weeks. Please try this if you have combo or dryish skin...young or mature. * I use IT face cream and love it but wanted to more moisture in my skin.  this product is amazing and I am so glad I found it.  Makes my skin feel so soft.  Love it!! * This moisturizer is moisturizing, however there are better, less expensive great ones out there.

I am very allergic to the products * Absolutely HATE this cream. Made my skin break out in tiny pimples that I am having a hard time getting rid of.

54,belif,the true cream - aqua bomb hydrating moisturizer,pimprod2043259,2619876," * I rarely do reviews and only when I really feel I can recommend a product.  I've been using belif True Cream- Aqua Bomb Hydrating Moisturizer since Fall of 2024 and have enjoyed it since day one.  It has a very nice gel-like consistency,  a light botanical fragrance, absorbs quickly, and provides a nice base for makeup that doesn't pill.  I'm in my late 50s so dryness is more of a concern but still get the occasional blemish. I also have sensitive skin and this moisturizer is very safe and gentle to my skin. It feels so refreshing when I put it on in the morning and in the evening after washing my face.  It's the part of my skin care routine that I look forward to the most! * Used to be the only thing i could use without breaking me out but with the new formula the added ingredients already have broke me out-_-
Go back to old formula PLS PLS PLS * Love the gel feel * I go back to this moisturizer time and time again, due to the fact that it is the most beautiful texture & delivers consistent results. Water-gel texture, no harsh fragrances, makes skin instantly feel smoother and also looks great under makeup. I recommend this constantly for my dehydrated friends! * I got this product as a sample and fell in love almost immediately. It's not greasy like most lotions and creams and it absorbs quickly. However, it's not labeled as cruelty free which is a big no from me. I googled it to find they do sell to mainland China, where animal testing is still required. So even though Belif doesn't test on animals themselves, they sell to countries that do. Unfortunate and disappointing, but no thanks! * I absolutely love this product,     it makes my skin very smooth * I have very dry skin and it is very picky! Never thought that a gel based product would work for me but it does. I apply it over sunscreen during the day and it doesn't pill like every other product. It also has a light, fresh, and beautiful scent. I'm a repeat customer."

Unfortunately it created a peeling like feeling combined with my makeup which has never happened before. 

I also feel like it makes my face red. 

The one thing I like most is the design, jar allows you to get every drop of product which is appreciated! * I've tried applying this alone and with my regular skincare routine and it pills up under makeup no matter what. Seems fine alone but still got kind of peely on the neck. * The first half of this jar was perfect but the closer i got to being halfway through this product it began to pill. Was pretty upset * This is my fIrst review. I have spent thousands on skincare for fine lines and milia. I have had lasers, injections, etc. This cream has completely erased my fine lines and almost completely eradicated years of milia around my eyes. I have my best friend hooked and I will never purchase a different cream. With that being said, it is not for sensitive skin. In my experience, anything that is this effective is not going to be gentle. I do not have sensitive skin. I can feel some burn, but no redness or reaction. I am 48 and I now have my skin back from my early 30s. I only wish that i would have had this then. * I haven't had any issues with this product besides the fact that it has a pretty bad smell to it so it's not enjoyable to put on. * I was super excited to use this moisturizer as it had SPF in it. But I am utterly disappointed. It caused severe eye irritation that i had to go see an ophthalmologist. No sunscreen has caused me such reaction so i was worreid. However i do think it's a good moistirozer with SPF but its just not for me. * This moisturizer initially feels amazing on the skin, and it worked well under my makeup. However, after a few hours, my eyes began to burn and sting! It happened on 2 separate days so i know that it is this moisturizer. Again, i really wanted to like this but it really irritates my eyes."

I know the reviews aren't good but; I had a  free sample of the face wash first, so I knew i would like it. I would say this if u don't like scented or oil on ur face, then pass on this. I love alot of moisturizer on my face so it doesn't bother me at all! Also I have eczema and it doesn't break me out although it's scented 😳 I love it! Love it! * Sometimes when I buy kits, I'll use most of them (but not all of them). With this kit, I use every single one of the products in here and I LOVE them! * I am SO VERY HAPPY I was able to purchase this set for my BIRTHDAY MONTH!!!!!  I am officially 51 years old.  My skin is incredibly HAPPY!!!!!  I have used TULA products for the past 6 years and when i saw this particular set on sale during the 21 days of beauty I HAD TO BUY IT!!!!!!!!  PLUS i was able to use my 20% off AND my ULTA REWARDS!!!!!!  So i got this for a STEAL!!!!!  OK so NO More bragging about me.  TULA has some of the ABSOLUTE BEST ANTI AGING AND SPECIFIC ROUTINE ADDRESSING PRODUCTS!!!!!!   I have had issues with drying skin around my mouth (upper area to chin).  And i have used everything under the sun!  However when i got to use the TULA 24/7 cream:  I WAS INCREDIBLY HAPPY!!!!!!!!!  Finally my skin is HYDRATED AND FEELING WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!  And I not oily on my forehead or nose!!!!!!!!!!  Love, LOVE TULA PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!! * This product made my oily face feel even greasier. * I did not like any product in this bundle. The facial cleanser doesn't get makeup off well. The moisturizer left my skin greasy, The brightening undereye stick didn't do anything but make my concealer go on wrong. * I love tula and a lot of there products however, definitely try one of there products before getting this bundle! I have sensitive skin and rosacea, i tried there firming moisturizer first before i bought this to see if i would have a reaction to tula products
The bundle is definitely a great deal and so far i have no issues or no break outs, its been a week! * Tula has helped my skin so much! I was scared to use it at first because my skin is so sensitive! But since ive been using i dont get big painful breakouts anymore! My skin is clear, soft, and glowing! I also used to have the little sweat bumps on my face, completely gone since using this! It did take about two weeks to see the results! So if you wait youll see the difference!

This is it! Love the clean ingredients and that it doesnt have much of a smell. My husband has even started using it, and that is saying something. * I have tried so many moisturizers. I have sensitive skin and I am also very careful with certain ingredients I use on my skin. This is the best moisturizer, it's hydrating but not greasy and great for day or night. I just mix it with my sunscreen in the morning. * I wanted to love this moisturizer because its clean- I didn't even mind the smell even though some complain about it. But I noticed after several weeks of use, I had many blackheads on my nose and chin. I didn't realize it wasn't non-comedogenic so that was on me for not paying attention. If you have acne or get breakouts, I wouldn't recommend this. * I wish the people who get the products for FREE other wise known as influencers would just be honest. I found it no big deal I've used other products for alot less money, but the 5 ⭐ crews won't be getting free stuff if they don't give a high score. Wait a few weeks to buy it and if you don't like return it, so this is an HONEST review. * Love it!! * I highly recommend this! I kept finding moisturizers that either broke me out or pilled on my face (deal breaker). This one does neither and keeps my face moisturized. It is on the pricey side, but I bought it on sale. The only thing I don't love is the smell. At first it just smells like nothing, but once I rub it in it's almost a chemical smell? Not sure, but I'll take that over not breaking me out. * It goes on like silk and makes your face feel soft and smooth. Feels good after I put on my toner and serums and then it's like a nice after finish. Good smell. Overall the best moisturizer I've used. Somewhere between a gel and a cream"

What I CANT use: PGA, HA, AHA's, Niacinamide, Shea Butter. After thorough research, I bought this product. I've been using this product for exactly 22 days (April 6th 2025). Within these 22 days my skin had had a massive improvement with my acne. Skin texture is smoother and more even. HOWEVER, something in this product is irritating my lips horrendously. Within the past 22 days I've had 4 irritation bumps appear just on my lips. After the first one appeared on April 15th, I immediately scheduled a visit with my dermatologist fearing the bump was something more sinister. Everything sinister was ruled out. She stated that it was likely a fordyce spot or a bump from something irritating my lip. At the time, I didnt equate the bump to the moisturizer. It went away after 5 days. But then another one appeared just two days later and I was at a loss. Ive NEVER had any issues with my
Lips. I couldnt understand why all of the sudden my lips looked like that. Terrified, i cautiously put on this moisturizer in the morning, avoiding my lips, and I havent had any appear for a week and a half. Yesterday, in a rush I applied this moisturizer and forgot to be careful around my lips. I woke up this morning with TWO bumps on my lips… unfortunately confirming that this product is the culprit of the bumps. I will be returning. * n/a * There has been something off with my skin though.It's flaking and dry, but I'm not sure if it had to do with the bubble. I think it might just be my skin overall. But my skin's been flaky and very dry. But it is a very good product and feels very hydrating on the skin. * I don't really like the smell of it, but it's a good base if you're into skin care smoothies like me * I was influenced to buy he bubble mosturizer.I have sensitive skin and i noticed after i used it i would start itching on my jaw and my neck.This gave me a rash!!!!Do not buy if you have sensitive skin instead you should go for cetaphil * I love this product. It's so hydrating and the packaging is so much fun. I definitely would recommend if you don't want your kids to be all in the retinal stuff which is bad for them.

He won't use anything else on his face now. * I have been dealing with some dermatitis and I have stripped my skin care down to cleansing and moisturizer.  The moisturizer was not doing much to keep my sensitive combination skin hydrated so I gave this a try with 100% on my Yuka app, i thought why not. I was a it nervous to try something new and I am glad i gave it a try. Let me tell you, I saw a major improvement from just one application. I hate the cost but I am loving the results. I am 47 and have been using it for a week, I can usually tell if I something will work with my skin within a few days because of how sensitive it is. This was a winner for me. * I had a retinol bad reaction and created redness and texture in ALL my face, with a gentle cleansing and this cream it healed in just a few days. * This is the perfect step for clean beauty skin.  Gentle cleansing that helps clear the pores and remove dead skin cells.  I find it makes a huge difference in achieving a bright, beautiful, healthy glowing face. * The best cream to help repair your skin barrier * Simply the best. Restorative, calming, balanced, and luxurious. This has been my go to for about a year and have gone through about 10 bottles. Does not break me out, helps calm my skin down when dry and irriated, and has totally repaired my barrier. Currently using tret .025% and a compound of azaelic/spirono/nicotinamide for hormonal acne, and this repair cream keeps my skin from drying out into a red crusty flake. I use it year round, hot muggy summers to dry cold winters. Worth it. * I love this product because my skin is so dry but i started to get a reaction around my eyes 😭😭"

The texture is exactly what it says very much lightweight gel like formula - very similar in my opinion to the Peter Thomas Roth one but more affordable which is a huge win. Would I use it over my tatcha water cream maybe not but it will stay in rotation! Little to no scent which I enjoy * I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. 

Let's just start of by saying there is no weird smell what so over. The packing is great because I carry it with me everywhere and doesn't spell despite it's more watery like texture. This is a great moisturizer for girlys that don't like to feel sticky or oily afterwards (because this product does not do that). I would definitely purchase again. * I received this item free in exchange for my honest review. The light, gel like formula of this moisturizer is perfect for the warmer weather. It wears wonderfully under makeup without being too heavy. Leaves the skin glowing and smooth! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I love how lightweight and moisturizing this cream is. It doesn't have any harsh smells or anything.

This is the only moisturizer I am able to continually use that actually works for my skin. I am dry and acne prone. 
I will usually develop irritations to products as I continue to use them (just some examples - La Roche Posay cleanser, Cocokind moisturizers, Clinique moisturizers, Aveeno oat cleaners, First Aid Beauty moisturizer, the list goes on with high end and drugstore products that end in irritation and sometimes acne flares). 
This cream can be Applied during my most irritated times and does not burn one bit. This is truly the only item i am extremely loyal to and recommend to EVERYONE. * This is amazing for rosacea and sensitive skin. * I almost exclusively use Avene at this point because I break out with the teeniest of fragrances. As I've gotten older, my rosacea has taken center stage. This calms it down. A tube lasts months. This lays perfectly under every makeup I use with no pilling. I don't tend to wear tons of foundation because my skin is absolutely radiant, but I can use full coverage MAC, Tarte, Dior, it all goes on flawlessly.  I layer different skincare year round but this is my always moisturizer. * I've tried many moisturizers and serums to fix my skin barrier after I destroyed it doing a 10 step care routine. So far, this works to make my cheeks less red without giving me acne. It also lessened a wrinkle caused by an acne scar. * I originally bought this product when it was on sale. I liked it well enough, but it ended up taking a backseat to my other well-loved lotions and creams. Then I got pregnant and developed cystic acne on my chin that was painful, and I couldnt get it to go away. I tried switching out my favorite Cerve nighttime cream for this Avene cream and OMG those large, deep pimples cleared up in a matter of days!

And this good amazing with moisturizer  i love it this my 5th time buying it. * I recently started using this product, every other day, 2 weeks today to be exact , I can see results. 
My skin is brighter, smoother and I notice my pores are tighter. * I like the retinol product itself, I have noticed it really helping with some discoloration and it is not too harsh which is great. However, the packaging is, in my opinion, terrible. Once you get down to less than half the product left, the material is so stiff that it hurrs my fingers to try and squeeze out. I am going to have to cut into it in order to get all of the product out. This makes me not want to repurchase. The product for the price is good but the packaging is so annoying that I was motivated to write a review dedicated to it. * As a43 year old, I've started noticing dark spots on my cheeks and forehead, but using this cream, every other night has lightened them up a huge amount! Now I've bought a bottle for my 19 year old daughter because she insists on tanning and has a few spots on her face. This cream will absolutely help her too! Love it * Really gentle and does what it's supposed to do. I have been using this for more than 6 months now and I will keep buying it. * this is THE retinol i use and i will die by this product. the retinol my dermatologist prescribed me was okay but too harsh and i think my slin barrier ultimately was ruined because of it. but this is gentle and creamy. my skin has never been this clean and even the infrequent pimples that show up, disappear withon a day or two… also i should add that i use other good molecule products like the super peptide and the daily brightening serum. instead of thinking about how to use products to remove all the acne/skin issues you have, think about how to use products to help your skin barrier heal so it can do its job!"

I have tried many moisturizers and I have finally found one that works! * the product seems good but if you know what some of the ingredients in this does to your body you will not want to apply this to your skin ever.. lots of endocrine disruptors which is thyroid issues along with a host of others.  some of the ingredients have to be authorized for manufacture to continue use. * I got some of this with a Lancome gift. I love the way it moisturizes and doesn't leave a greasy feel. Skin on my face feels so soft all day long. Had to buy a full size and now the gift one is in my travel bag. * My mother bought this product and I noticed it had a strong fragrance to it. Now I'm not a dermatologist, but I have enough knowledge to know that anything fragrance is horrible for your skin. Anyway, my skin broke out in hives when I tried this product, along with acne. Please don't buy skincare from Lancome, it's not the best for most people. * I love how this looks on my skin! It's matte but hydrating. Happy that it has hyaluronic acid as well. My makeup looks so good now! I used to use tatcha but didn't like oily it made my skin look. This will now be my go to! * I have normal to dry skin, but a lot of moisturizers will clog my pores if i sleep in them. I just stopped wearing a mositurizer to bed altogether for a while for this reason. When I saw the ingredients in this I became curious and decided to give it a try. My skin is so hydrated and looks beautiful in the morning! Also, if i develop a blemish during the day, I will still slap this moisturizer on top of it at night and not only does it not make it worse, it actually heals it and my skin clears up so much faster! Highly recommend this product. * This was recommended to me by the consultant and I love it."
79,good molecules,lightweight daily moisturizer,pimprod2023937,2582316," * I love the brand Good Molecules due to how little product I need to cover my face. The moisturizer leans on the more oily side in my opinion, but once it soaks into the skin there is no oily feeling on the skin. I find it works well under my makeup during the day as well. * I'm not sure I would describe this as ""lightweight""- it feels quite rich, but I prefer that! My skin is balanced/normal with some dryness. This product has no fragrance, works well under makeup, and unbeatable price. I love it! * Best moisturizer. Great for keeping skin plump. * No irritation and so good on my skin * I previously used a well-known face wash and moisturizer for years until I discovered that both contained endocrine disruptors, which mess with hormones. I did my research, found this brand, and gave it a try. For context, I used this mosituzer and the Good Molecules Hydrating Facial Cleansing Gel twice a day (and nothing else) and within 4 days I could tell a noticable difference! I absolutely love it and my face feels very clean and soft!! A few notes: 1) a little bit goes a long way, which makes it pretty affordable and 2) it does provide a white cast when you first put on the mosituzer, just spend the extra time to really blend it into the skin. In addition, I used to have difficult with past products making my skin oily half way through the day and I did not have that issue with this product. While I found this product to contain clean/healthy ingredients and provide amazing results, I recommend everyone do their research on the ingredients within their skincare products. * This facial moisturizer has been my go-to for over a year! It is so moisturizing, yet still lightweight feeling.  My skin looks and feels so good using this and it has never made me break out. I always make sure to have it, if I am running low you better believe I bought a backup. * I have dry, sensitive skin that's prone to rosacea and this product was fine for me. It's lightweight and absorbs into my skin quickly, but it isn't as hydrating as I need for the desert climate I live in. I could see it being good for the summer or in more humid environments."

It is really lightweight and not greasy it is really comfortable and there is NO SMELL which is even better for me. I like unscented face products. I had no issues with breakouts or anything when using this product. Love that it is also reasonably priced. * I usually buy the same face cream but it is really expensive and this product is a quarter of the price and is amazing. The cream is thick and so moisturizing. My skin loves it. Whoever thinks only the most expensive products work haven't tried this. Do your skin and wallet a favor and try for yourself! * Wanted to love this but it pills :( * This is my second purchase of ELF face cream and I love how it feels on my face. It feels hydrating and it has a luxurious feel to the cream. It smooths out nicely and doesn't feel greasy. The price is pretty good too! * I am in my 40s a brown girl, I have always used Elf primers but nothing else from the brand. Recently started using  other products all excellent. 
     This is so hydrating , clear up my face and 
I look stunning. Skin bounced back to life . * This product made my skin feel hydrated, but very itchy. It has niacinamide in it, which appears to be an irritant for sensitive skin. Sadly, I needed to discontinue use. * My skin has always been really sensitive and not the easiest to take care of I have a mix of dry and oily skin making it hard to take care of but this literally saved my skin and I will never go back. 1000% reccomend"

I had stopped using it because I thought it was breaking me out (turns out it was another product) but went back to it when I did have a really bad breakout and it completely cleared it! * i feel like i barely need a primer, it's so good! hydrated and softened my skin so well * this is my favorite face moisturizer. it's decent price for a face moisturizer, and i've never noticed any issues after using it. it does it's job, and I love how lightweight it feels on my face. plus, it lasts so long for a small bottle. * I started using this product as my face tends to be oily and at the very beginning, it was working perfectly - not oily residues for sure. Issue is, after a while of daily use, my skin would feel dry; even patchy. Wouldn't wear underneath make-up, for sure. * I was using the glow watermelon and it was alright but my skin now is so soft and looks so healthy and it really glows without feeling greasy or making me look super oily"

It happened 2-3 times because at first I wasn't sure if it was this product or not. It does have a smell to it but I don't find it overpowering. For the few times I used it, it did seem to moisturize well. I'm glad this works for other folks :) * My girlfriend is trying it, because this is the wrong one that I bought.  She likes the day cream with 25 SPF. So far no complaints with her using it for a week now. I'm going to buy her the Lancome Aquagel SPF 50 for a base of her make-up and sun protection and see if they work well together. She already uses the Lancome Rose water Lotion and Toner. * The cream works well but it has a strong fragrance. I have used this cream for about a month and the fragrance is too much for me. I will continue to use it but wish there was a fragrance free version. * I have used this product for years, it clears my face leaves it smooth and young looking. I recommend this product * I bought the Lancome holiday gift pack with this included. Otherwise I don't think I would've ever bought it. Out of the entire set this is the one I use consistently because of the way it feels. Woke up today and forgot I used to have age spots. They're gone. * This has a strong perfume smell.  I bought it half off during days of beauty.  Reviews are good but that strong perfume smell.  might use it on chest instead of face to use up. * Ive tried a lot of face creams, this is definitely in my top 3. This cream is ideal for mornings where you want something moisturizing but not too oily. I can also see a difference in brighness and fine lines. I also feel like this cream works with most skin types. I have dry skin and it works well as a day cream."

The duo smells nice and feels jice going on. Howecer this juice was not worth the squeeze and the dispenser clogged easily and often. * I went to buy a product that was highly recommended. The store associate introduced me to the Juice line, and it is the first product line that I honestly felt almost instantaneous results. * I started with the samples and i was really hoping I would hate it since it is so expensive. Unfortunately I loved it, and now I'm forced to spend a fortune on skincare. Use with their vitamin c, primer, foundation and translucent powder and your aging face will thank you, but your bank account won't. * I love juice beauty's products so I couldn't wait to try this product! I used it night cream the first night I got it and woke up and washed my face and placed on the day cream. Moments afterward my face began to feel very itchy and uncomfortable. If I would itch it would leave scratch welts all over my face (what it looks like when a dog jumps up and scratches you is the best way to describe it), followed by an itchy sensation from my head to my toes. Once I would itch I would get little hive bumps and the scratch welts all over my body. Very sad this product did not work out for me, but wanted to warn others that have sensitive skin."
84,fresh,rose deep hydration face cream,pimprod2025112,2584148," * Love the texture and smell of this cream. I use it everyday in the morning after my cleanser. It feels refreshing and lightweight. * Love the day and night cream * Huge fan of fresh products. Received in a sample and then bought the full size. Within 6 weeks my skin got so dry, tight, and inflamed. Acne sprung up. The skin especially around my chin / jaw / cheeks started cracking and scabbing. It smells and feels so nice but the end result over time was not good. Switched my moisturizer and immediately the cracking, inflammation, and acne went back to normal. 

Love Fresh but not this product. * They dont give that much product to see if it does anything and it clog my pours more * It works great. Its not greasy. It absorbs well, and my skin is soft. My sensitive skin is not adversly affected in any way. It's a good moisturizer, and it's light scent smells great. * I wanted to love this moisturizer because I've loved other products from Fresh and I love the scent, but it was very disappointing. I used it at night after my full routine, and noticed within about 30 minutes that my skin felt tight (not moisturized). It was like the product had dried into a layer sitting on top of my skin. The next morning my skin didnt feel well-hydrated at all, in fact I had dry patches in areas that would typically be fine with previous moisturizers I've used. Unfortunate for the high price point, but maybe it's just not for me. * I really really wanted to love this moisturizer because of the texture, fragrance and overall feeling when putting it on but the peeling is crazy! For the price this product should not be peeling off pf my face within 5 minutes of me putting it on. Love the texture + fragrance but hate the peeling."

This one is just too much and too long. If Lancome had a frangrance-free option I would prefer it but returning because I can't get past the smell. Bought it during half off sale. I definitely wouldn't pay full price. * Great product * It's smooth lite smell one of my favorites * I was so excited to try this product but unfortunately it didn't work out for me. For reference I was in shade 420 N in their foundation. This product does indeed leave a white cast and makes me look grey. This product leaves me feeling very greasy and if you add even the slightest too much of the product it moves and disrupts foundation put on top of it. I don't ever mind the price of a product so long as it works and sunscreen is so important is good to invest on a product that's literally protecting you but this isn't it. * Bought this when on sales. Its the best combo sunscreen with vitamin, primer and sunscreen all in one.  Love it! * This has way too much fragrance and smells like old lady perfume. Shame on me for not reading the ingredients, but not many of the recent reviews mention a strong perfume scent. But if you look at them, it has added fragrance.

The sunscreen itself is ok, but I wouldn't call it lightweight. It's definitely a thicker moisturizer/sunscreen and probably best suited for dry skin. My combo skin wasn't overly greasy, but for me it is just too heavy for daytime use. Also, It didn't do anything to help my makeup look better or last, so not that great as a primer.

I got it during the 21 days of beauty, and even at half price, it's way too much for this product. Other than vitamin E, there are no real skincare benefits in it. There are so many better sunscreens. I hate waste so I'll probably continue to use it as a body sunscreen. But with all the fragrance it's not going anywhere near my face."

It is on the thicker side but it spreads nicely and doesnt pill when paired with clinique moisture surge 100H or peach and lily's matcha moisturizer (my two HG moisturizers). You need your moisturizer to dry for 15 minutes and THEN apply your spf, this dramatically reduces it from pilling. It does look very orange when dispensed but it gives me a great sheer tint that looks like I put makeup on, its beautiful! So I wear alone typically on non-makeup days but does work very well as a primer as well (I use IT cosmetics CC+ foundation in light warm medium. For reference, I am also WN04 Bone in Clinique even better makeup so light/med and the tint works great for me. Wish it came in a bigger bottle!

I will not be running out of this all year round! Woohoo * Can't get over the tacky texture - not expected at this price point.  I'll be going back to the Shiseido sunscreen - still haven't found anything better.  Really disappointed. * I'm pretty fair and wore this every day in Aruba for a week without having to reapply throughout the day. Great sun protection and light weight. My new go to product in the summer * Also the closer you get to the bottom of the tube it begins to pill * I use this in addition to my moisture surge. I love the hydration of moisture surge and love the finish of this sunblock. Everybody I have let try (varying skin types and shades) has looked amazing after using this. Your skin will look more evenly textured and smooth after using this. Its like wearing makeup, but you're not and it looks super natural. It also works fantastic under make up. Great primer. I have rosacea and acne prone skin that is sensitive and out of all of the products I have ever tried, this and moisture surge hydrate and protect the best. I have dry combination skin. * I have been using this product daily for over a year. I really like it and I feel it smooths the skin and helps prevent sun damage."

Does anyone know if Ulta has old stock formula they have purchased recently? I tried to find question section. So purchase if they have original * In my constant quest for skincare products that deliver real results, I recently tried the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid. This lotion claims to gently exfoliate, boost cell turnover, and provide deep hydration to uncover softer, smoother skin. Let's dive into my experience with this multi-tasking formula.

The lotion is non-greasy and lightweight, making it perfect for daily use. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and hydrated without any heavy residue. The product is fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for those with sensitive skin or a sensitivity to strong scents. The natural smell from the lactic acid salts is subtle and varies slightly depending on your skin's unique pH, but it's not overpowering or unpleasant. * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is revolutionary! It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy!"

My skin felt so plump and hydrated, with slightly reduced redness. I'm saving up to put this amazing cream again. The texture is thick, but absorbed well. Love it a lot!! * This product is very thick and little bit goes a long way.  I have been using it consistently for a week and my skin feels so soft. My skin has the tendency to be very dry and flaky especially with it being so cold and windy.  My skin is loving the extra moisture it is getting. * Perfect addition to my night time skin care routine. So buttery and moisturizing. It is too thick for me to use during the daytime under my makeup, but I just use the original tula for that :) * This is an excellent moisturizer for dry and irritated skin!I use it nightly after my prescription acne treatments and it really helps keep my skin hydrated and is very soothing. * I got this as a sampler and used it for about a week.  Everytime i put it on, it burned my face. I thought maybe it was one of the other serums i had on that was having a reaction to, but slowly began to realize it was this moisturizer. I am not experiencing a rash in my eye areas and cheeks. * I have combination, sensitive skin. I generally use a light weight moisturizer daily after showering and sometimes at night when I actually bother to wash my face. It's always worked great but I was experiencing a little bit of dryness so I decided to try this. It didn't irritate my skin at any point but it also didn't moisturize my skin. Trying to wear makeup only magnifies the dryness/flaking (and it's a hydrating CC cream). * I like to wear this at night. I put it on as the last step to my routine at night. It locks everything in beautifully and my skin feels nice and soft in the morning.

I've never tried it on under makeup as I light lighter creams under makeup."

I love how moisturized it leaves my skin & i love how i can go out with out any makeup and my skin looks so GREAT. It's seriously worth it. * I bought this as I was searching for an affordable dupe of the Tatcha moisturing cream. This is really close to it as it is hydrating, leaves your skin feeling and looking supple, and decent price point. Korean are known for their products and this one does not disappoint even during the winter dey weather, it hydrates and sits well under makeup.

Then when I couldn't find it anymore, around 2014, I stumbled upon the Renewed Hope in a Jar, and I had actual hope. I was not pleased with it. That turned me away from Philosophy for about 10 years. Then i saw this. When I finally had the motivation to look at Philosophy again and get that beloved Hope In A Jar, I looked for it and found what I believed was IT. I washed, toned and prepped my skin for a luxurious moisturizer, and then my face immediately started burning, especially around my nose. I was not expecting this and I was definitely not welcoming this. Once I inspected the jar, i realized it was Hope In A Jar--Smooth Glow. I don't know what that ""smooth glow"" is supposed to do, but it's definitely NOT smooth OR moisturizing. * Purity is the best face wash . I've been using it for many years.

It also is a fantastic retinol seum in cream! Goes on smoothy and feels good on the skin. * I buy this It product when it is on sale,  as the product itself is OK.   HOWEVER, I wish they would change the pump lid....it works a few times and then stops.  You end up having to unscrew it just like a normal jar to get the moisturizer out.

96,vanicream,moisturizing cream pump,pimprod2042406,2619667," * I wanted to love this moisturizer, I really did.

I have really dry skin around my eye area (like red, itchy, raised/inflames, peeling skin around the eyes in the winter), normal on the lower half of my face, and oily on the forehead. So im definitely a combination skin type, and i had heard great things about vanicream, and my sister uses it, so when i first got into skincare, I thought it would be a good option.

This moisturizer is SO THICK. Unbelievably thick. And hard to spread. 

I do an oil cleanse routine, as i have a lot of sebaceous filaments and clogged pores but not too much acne issues. I would oil cleanse, and use my toner. At this point in my routine, i would feel like my pores were so clear and my face was so shiny.

Then, i would apply my vanicream, and it was like my 10 minutes of previous skincare didn't exist. It's like i was watching the moisturizer clog my pores back up.

It also feels like this moisturizer never soaks in. Any contact my face has with any object just seems to get slimy again from the moisturizer, which is a big issue seeing as i wear glasses constantly and a cpap at night. So im constantly pushing my glasses back up and cleaning off the bridge, and my cpap just leaks in the middle of the night with mask farts because the silicone is slicked with moisturizer, even if i applied it 3 yours before bedtime.

I will say, i havent had issues with dry skin around my eyes since i started using it. So if you dont care to minimize pores or get rid of your sebaceous filaments, and are mroe worried about treating intense dry skin, go for it. This is your moisturizer. Otherwise, its almost like youre ruining the entire purpose of your skincare. * Everyone raves about how wonderful this stuff is so i thought I'd give it a try. It leaves your skin feeling horribly sticky! I've used it twice, thinking maybe i used too much this first time. Nope, still sticky and gross. So disappointed! * i use this as my moisturizer at night and it helps my dry skin so much! it lasts forever too. * I layer this on top of ny retinol at night wnd it keeps my face well moisturized * Let me just say I was excited to use this product until I actually used it! I have very sensitive skin and after seeing so many positive reviews/ recs from friends I decided to try it… This is the only thing I have changed in my routine and when I say my acne hasn't been this bad in a long time I mean it. It is SO so bad. Everywhere (face,neck,chest, upper arms) I used it is breaking out. Definitely returning this product! * this is the only moisturizer I can use on my sensitive dry skin. I've used it for years along with their gentle face wash. * I have extremely sensitive skin and live in a dry climate. I have tried multiple moisturizers ranging anywhere from more natural, low-ingredient to high-end, dermatologist grade. Everything either made me breakout, left my skin red and still dry, and in some cases even caused chemical burns. I've tried brands like CeraVe, Ethique, Clinique, Dermalogica, etc. and none seem to help. After doing some research, I saw others say this low-ingredient, fragrance-free moisturizer helped them. After only a few uses, I was AMAZED!! My skin stayed hydrated all day, was noticeably less red, and wasn't breaking out. 
I would say maybe start with the lotion if you're on the oily side or live in a more humid climate. But as someone with already dry, sensitive skin and living in a dry climate, this has worked WONDERS. Cannot recommend enough. I hope the formula never changes!"

I guess it works okay even though it's really heavy for a day cream and I'm 53 so I wear heavy creams during the day! But the thickness of this is like a night cream, but of course night creams don't have sunscreen so weird. I just can't get past the smell so it's sort of doesn't matter how well it works. * I tried this as it was on sale. Been buying No. 7 for years. While the product felt great on my skin, there was an off scent I can only describe as throw-up. Really bad. My daughter concurred with me, and I ended up tossing it. Would not recommend. * When I opened this it smelled weird. I thought maybe it was old. I stirred it up and it still kinda smells but I am dealing with it. * been using this for 3 months and you can still see my hyperpigmentation. for a product so expensive I expect it to work in less than 3 months. I use the serum and the night cream as well and my skin still is not cleared up. * Received this as a full size sample.  It goes on super shiny and does not get absorbed into the skin, and I have oily skin as is, so I end up looking ridiculously oily and shiny all day.  Might be fine for someone with very dry skin but avoid if you're combo or oily * Fabulous product. * Was part of GWP. Nasty ingredients. Chemical sunscreens, BHT and more. Will be tossing this GWP."

I use this in the AM and PM paired with retinol, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and vitamin c serum. this is light enough to apply before SPF without feeli g too heavy. * Another good skincare product! The only downside is when you get down to the end, you can't really tell if you've used it all or not, so I keep pumping it. * I have been Cerave moisturizing cream for years as it has been the only cream that has worked for my dry eczema prone skin, so I thought I would give this a try. I have combination skin that is more on the oily side. I liked the texture and feel of this product. Unfortunately I ended up having a terrible reaction to it - red bumps all over my face. :( * I like that it's super light and does add a lot of moisture.  It also doesn't have sunscreen, which is what I was looking for.  (I always wear sunscreen outside, but if I'm just going to be inside at the office, I'd rather not have it.)  It's a little pricey for the volume.  Because it's the thick plastic tube, you think you're getting more than you are.  Mine is depleting quickly.  I also wish it had different packaging in general, environmentally. * I have used this for almost a year now and my skin loves it!   My skin is very dry and sensitive, so I can only use certain products.    This is an awesome product, it helps with dryness and is not heavy or greasy.  Your skin can still breathe after using this, it's so light and refreshing. * this might be my favorite cerave moisturizer. i first tried it in May this year alongside another new product Vanicream Vitamin C. all summer this was my favorite combo.
vanicream vitamin c + cerave gel moisturizer + hero cosmetics force shield spf. 

it made my sensitive, skin happy all summer. I'm going to keep it going the rest of the year. * Great, light weight moisturizer for summer months.  Non greasy, and absorbs quickly.  No residue on my hands.  My face feels hydrated and soft all day long.  Would highly recommend and I plan to re-purchase for next summer!

I tried it once and it broke me out! Now I've spent weeks trying to clear up my skin. * I went into Ulta looking for a new, clean face cream, eye cream and face tint. Ended up buying all of that and the primer. I've been using it all for 5 days now. My skin has never been dryer!! It's all going back! Almost $300 and, for me, it's awful. * Based on the reviews, wanted to try out something new. I was in search of a better moisturizing cream. This wasn't it. First off, is it me or does it smell like Windex? The worst part, ended up with some serious cystic acne. And I'm over 60 years old! Extremely disappointed. Would not recommend."

Unfortunately, when I tried the sample I was traveling in England for the holidays and it was overcast and dreary. When I tried it at home, I was outside for about an hour in the morning... and got burnt. The SPF just doesn't hold up to the Southern California sun. * Absolutely love Elemis!!!! Great moisturizer that never disappoints. It's my final step in my skincare routine and couldn't live without it. Plus, it smells divine! * I have been using Elemis Pro collagen Marine cream with SPF 30 for several years. My shin is smoother and more even toned, plus it keeps me from forgetting to use sunscreen. * I first got as a sample. Then I purchased the full size. Appreciated the 50% discount. * This is the best lotion with sunscreen. I was lucky to get it on the daily sale so paid half the price. otherwise, I would never be able to afford this. But so far, it's worth every penny. I have been using Mario Badescu for maybe 15 years-the oil free spf 30 moisturizer. It always has made my face red after applying and then of course I use my Jane Iredale loose powder to cover the redness and even out my skin. So now with this product, so no red face and it slides on nice and easily. It has a slight fragrance which is lovely and it doesn't bother my sensitive skin. I would give it a try if you're able. So far, it's been great for me. * Its over 100 dollars and its not a good product! And only onr ounce! DO. NOT. BUYYY! * Amazing face cream with spf. I love EIemis.... just wonderful"

108,e.l.f. cosmetics,holy hydration! face cream spf 30,pimprod2025445,2582406," * I've been using the e.l.f. Holy Hydration! Face Cream with SPF and honestly, I love it. It's super hydrating without being heavy or sticky, and it doesn't feel like you're wearing sunscreen at all—which is rare. It feels just like a nice face cream, not tacky or greasy like some SPF products.

One of my favorite things about it is how easy it is to reapply. I like to reapply sunscreen throughout the day, so having it in this cream format just makes sense—it's convenient and feels good on the skin. The fragrance is subtle and pleasant, and it leaves my skin looking fresh and healthy.

For me, this works even better than a skin tint with SPF. With skin tints, you usually need to apply a thick layer to get proper sun protection, and that just ends up looking off, especially on textured or acne-prone skin like mine. With this cream, I can just apply my regular amount, get hydration and sun protection, and then spot-conceal any areas if I want extra coverage.

I have sensitive, acne-prone, and textured skin, and this cream hasn't irritated it at all. I don't wear makeup every day, but I do wear this every single day. It's become a staple in my routine. * I love that it has SPF 30. What a bonus! * This product has helped my skin so  much. I have very dry skin. Most sunblocks only focus on doing the job of keeping your skin from getting a sunburn. This product goes above and beyond the call of duty by also being a very good moisturizer. * Keeps moisture in and having spf 30 is a bonus!! * This is a moisterizer I have repurchased a few times, and am always pleasantly surprised. While it is not the richest moisterizer, which I prefer for night time, it is great for day time use, especially for oily skin. It's very light and airy, and super hydrating. My skin feels like it takes a big drink of water when I use this. I have combination skin and a history of cystic acne, and find this to be good fo sensitive skin and doe snot clog pores or feel heavy. The reason I am rating this 4/5 is because I think it could be slightly richer. I seem to go through this jar more frequently than other moisterizers. * I've tried other daily moisturizers with SPF 30, and they still felt like moisturizers. This one feels very much like sunscreen and also smells like it. It is only ok for hydration, and doesn't feel as gentle on the skin as other similar products I tried. * Will be buying again.

This stuff is phenomenal! My fine lines are lessened this is so hydrating and amazing!! This os definitely staying in my skincare routine * As a teenager with dehydrated skin, I'm a little picky with my moisturizers. Some are extremely expensive or they're too water, too thick, or just don't have the best texture. I accidentally discovered this moisturizer while looking for a new one to replace my cerave, and I ordered it. I immediately fell in love! It's long lasting, gives me dewy skin, VERY long hydration and wears amazing under makeup. A little goes a long way, and putting too much will probably make your makeup pill. I use this day and night or when I wash my face. I highly will recommend this for dry skin, I've gotten many of my friends to use this and they love it! * I have spent the last couple of years- yes, YEARS- trying to find the perfect moisturizer. I've tried them all: Eminence, Peach and Lily, Tatcha, Avené, Vanicream, The Ordinary, CeraVe, Neutrogena, Orgins, PTR, stuff from the spas I worked at (I'm a licensed Aesthetician) plus more and nothing has been my favorite. 

I wouldn't see great results or they'd break me out either in fungal acne or white heads, my skin would feel greasy or be flakey. I have sensitive, combo skin thats very acne prone and rosacea to top it all off. I finally broke down and asked an Ulta worker for their opinion and they brought me to this. I was hesitant but bought it anyways. 

My skin has seriously never looked better!! Fine lines? Gone. Redness? Where?? Breakouts?? Haven't heard of her. I cannot talk about this enough! If you're stuggling like I was, PLEASE buy this asap. I can't get over the fact it's $25- you get so much and just a little bit goes a long ways. I'm obsessed. I would never write such a long review but the people need to know! * Super hydrating and leaves my skin dewy * I am a licensed Esthetician & have never had acne.

Bought it for my boys. * Works wonders and helped with my bacne * My dermatologist recommended CeraVe SA for my psoriasis flare ups and it's been very helpful.  I prefer it to using steroids or other topical prescriptions whenever possible.  Great product. * Super expensive… but this is the only lotion that doesnt cause breakouts on my back and I actually notice the amount of back breakouts have lessened when i use this. 
Makes my skin feel really soft instead of just coated. * I could have sworn I remembered this being a holy grail product for the acne on my back and shoulders, and I also remembered it being significantly less expensive than it is now. Now, it contains mineral oil and has done nothing to help my body breakouts - in fact I feel more greasy and more broken out than before! Works okay for other parts of my body less prone to acne (like fighting ingrown hairs on legs, etc) but it's just too expensive for the ingredients list now."

So far this product has left me pleasantly surprised, it didnt leave me a greasy mess at the end of my work day. I will add that I hydrate and moisturize well before applying this to keep my skin balanced. I think that others who say they are left greasy probably have dehydrated skin. Making sure you not only moisturize your skin but hydrate it as well! * This did nothing for pores or oiliness.  Wish I could still return it. * Does not mattify or control oily skin.  Just terrible! * I beg you Murad, never get rid of this product. It has changed my skin so much. I used to fight my oily skin constantly. With this I feel like I have normal skin I don't have to worry about mid-day.   I stop myself from overstocking because I'm scared it'll stop being made. If you have oily skin I implore you to give this a try. * This is fine on its own for a workout, but it pills horribly if you put any makeup on top. No oil control. Very thick formula that does'nt spread easily, so you'll go through the tube very quickly. * I have oily, sensitive skin so it is very difficult for me to find a daily sunscreen.

If I could recommend another product that pairs extremely well with this, and I have seen immediate improvements from, it would be the pink skin barrier serum. I use two pea sizes of this, after the serum, and it covers my face, neck, and décolletage. * First I purchased the gel moisturizer, and it made my face sticky.  I purchased this moisturizer hoping it would absorb better with it being a cream.  I was wrong.  Up to an hour later, and it's still not absorbed enough to put powder foundation on.  Not impressed. * Using for more than a year now. Obsessed with this. * Love this effective, hydrating, perfect weight and budget friendly moisturizer. * The better formula for my mature skin and it is effective. * I live in the arctic, and have the world dryest and sensetive skin. This moisturizer gives the thick greasy feel i have searched forver for. Your face will soak up the grease, so if im going to use it under makeup i usually wait 30min or so for that. For days/nights im really dry ill use the rosehip oil under this cream and *chefs kiss*. My dry skin has never had a happier winter- i can wear foundation again without getting dry patches!! * I think this moisturizer is quite nice, probably a bit on the pricier side for TO but regardless still a decent product. I would say the only downside is that this would probably benefit someone that doesn't have dry skin, (which is odd considering it's labeled as ""rich"") or if you're doing a full routine with serums, or toners, etc since you'll have that added moisture.

Im 27 and have been struggling with the appearance of genetic facial expression wrinkles :( hopefully ive found my holy grail !! * I will not be buying this cream again or recommending it. This product has a very thick and heavy consistency and a very strong perfume smell.

Overall, I don't hate it, but it really did nothing for my skin. * I love it! I have a combination skin. My t zone always gets oily with white heads.

Disappointing. * I am a big Dermalogica fan, however, this product was a disappointment.  I cannot use it for daytime under my makeup as it causes a ""pilling"" effect as I apply my foundation.

It absorbs well, softens skin, and doesnt leave skin greasy or tacky. I would buy a big bottle of this. I wish it werent so expensive. * I was looking for something that might be better than the Cerave lotion I was using for a long time that had parabens in it. My skin is sensitive and lots of things tend to irritate or break me out. Nothing changed but this lotion. I don't know what's in it that did it, but I immediately started breaking out. It claims to be for sensitive skin, but I'll take the parabens over that. And they've recently taken them out. So I won't be using this lotion."

The pump never pumped anything so I took it off and there was no straw attached to it at all. Now I have to smack the bottle on my palm to get anything to come out. Not worth the month since I can't get all the product out. The product itself is great. * My skin was getting dry and patchy, and I stumbled upon this moisturizer. I decided to give it a shot and boy was that a good decision! In a matter of 3 days my skin went from dry to hydrated and plump! ❤️ * I have sensitive combination skin, and this was just okay. I was expecting it be much more moisturizing than what it was, and it didnt really inprove my skin any. It didnt make it worse - so thats a plus - but there are definitley better moisturizers out there. Would really only recommend if you have fairly normal/unproblematic skin. * I love this moisturizer! It's great at hydrating my aging, sensitive skin. It feels good when it goes on, and doesn't feel like it dries up quickly. 

My only complaint is the packaging. It's really hard to get all of the product out of the bottle, when you are near the end. 

But that won't stop me from purchasing again! * These products came highly recommended by a biochemist on tiktok .

It leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated. * I had a sample of this and enjoyed it so I was happy to get the full size. It doesn't smell like before. Before I felt like it had no scent and now it has a chemical kind of scent. It's still moisturizing and I enjoy using it so one star off for the scent. But that's clean beauty for you. * Leaves my skin smooth and hydrated. I use it with the TBT Serum. I have just been using Dime since December and I truly love it and see a huge difference in the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles. I have found this to be very effective and no irritation or discomfort. * I recently purchased Dime DBT Cream, but I'm quite disappointed with the changes in its ingredients. After comparing the product's box and the website, it's clear that the ingredients listed are significantly different. One notable change is that Bakuchiol, which used to be a key ingredient, is now listed near the bottom of the ingredients list. Meanwhile, VP Copolymer, which was previously much lower, is now near the top. This shift raises concerns about the formulation and effectiveness of the product. I'm a little frustrated that the ingredients have changed without clear communication or transparency. If you're someone who trusted the original formulation, be cautious and do your research before purch * Was looking for an alternative to retinol during my pregnancy, and found this. I use this with the TBT oil and my skin has been doing so well. My breakouts have cleared, and my skin overall just feels great. Hoping that this will help with spot corrections due to pregnancy. I've tried so many products in the past, and I'm so glad I found this. * This product made my face all fricking acne and never buy it it makes you get rinkles faster if I were you don't ever buy this product in your life!!!!!!!🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮😡😡😡😡😡"

It caused redness on my cheeks. Product was way too heavy. I have combindation type skin. This product might be better for 50+ * I usually don't mind fragrance in cosmetics and skincare products but the fragrance in this is so strong it will irritate your eyes if it gets near your eye area which is not ideal for when you do not have time/money to apply an eye cream separately. It's not a nasty fragrance but it is very irritating to the eyes, but if you happen to get it near the corners of your mouth it will gross you out... it's inconvenient because other facial moisturizers for the same price aren't this much of a hassle. I like Clarins but they need to tone down the fragrance in their facial products. * Excellent product u can see the results immediately * My face is sensitive and oily to normal. This one moisturizer does it all for me. I'm scared to change. * This is an amazing day moisturizer that adds glow, is lightweight but has a luxurious, thick feel to it, smells heavenly (but very light). Filled with natural extracts and antioxidants, it has made a day for my combo skin in late 30s. My skin looks renewed: plump and radiant. Overall, this is better than many other more expensive options and even produces better anti-aging effects on my skin, compared to Clarins' own anti-aging line. I have purchased 3rd jar, and will probably stick with it moving forward as it is very good for my sensitive skin and doesn't clog pores, irritate, or dry it. Love it!!! * I am 55 with very dry skin. I tried this with the other Clarin's serums and even topped it with a vitamin C oil. I dont think it will work for winter. And, I dont see it working for a nightine cream during the winter. It would be a nice moisturizer for summer I believe if you have dry skin. 
For all the other skin types it might work well for you. * I really love this product. I've alternated between a variety of higher end brands over the last 14 years and this is my favorite, and I have tempermental skin. It's so worth it."

Whenever i wear it it makes my skin drier than it was before in a few hours and makes my skin really greasy and oily. Plus the price is really high for the mini tbat I bought. I don't recomend this and i will not be repurchasing. The only pro is that there is no whitecast. * Finally a 50 spf sunscreen that doesn't leave a white residue. * Easy to use, you don't need much, not greasy, smooth and no sun gets through!!  Love it! * This product is definitely worth the hype. I'm convinced my skin looks different after just eight weeks of testing this serum, some acne scars have disappeared and my acne has toned down a bit. My complexion is more radiant overall.My skin became significantly more radiant—there's now a luminous quality to it. My favorite part about the serum is how the results build over time. I've grown more confident about my bare skin and it's because this product gave me a more radiant, even complexion. Gifted by * Gifted by Supergoop. Okay, let's talk about a sunscreen that actually does everything—this is the Supergoop! PLAY Everyday Face Lotion with SPF 50, and yes… it really is that good. No white cast, no weird residue, no sticky finish—just smooth, clear protection that disappears into your skin. It's fragrance-free, so it's perfect even for sensitive skin days * Perfect sunscreen to keep in your bag! I live in a very sunny climate so sunscreen daily is a must! Supergoop has amazing sunscreens and I love using this one daily. It's seamless and adds a nice glow to your skin! Gifted by super goop. * Gifted by Supergoop. Facial sunscreen spf 50.

Love * I have super sensetive skin and cystic acne and I had not found a moisturizer that didn't break me out until i found this, ive repurchased so many times i recommend this to everyone! * I've tried so many Moisturizers for my dry skin and this one has definitely been the best. My state is very dry and I already have dry skin in the first place and this leaves a very nice cooling feeling and it leaves my skin looking so nice and soft * I purchase .5 ounce and I didn't realize how little I got.  it is trial size.  it isn't worth the money I spent and I will be returning it!!!! * There is nothing wrong with this cream. It's good for mild psoriasis, gentle on flakey skin and non-comedogenic. But I don't find it better than most other moisturizers and treatments for my occasional flakes. I find azelaic acid and retinoids produce better results, so this cream doesn't add much to my skincare routine. I'll use this up, but I don't see myself repurchasing this. * I have alwasy had sensitive skin and recently i just got really bad cystic acne and needed moisturizer that didnt sting my face and this did not bother my skin at all!

I learned the teick is to keep it deeply moisturized. So, ill jse the regukar snail rescue moisturizer and then layer it with this one in the am and pm and my winter acne was no more! Its also non-comodogenic, alcohol free, and cruelty free. Amazing product higgky recommend! * I have combination skin: oily t zone and super dry everywhere else. This moisturizer somehow makes my skin more dry. I guess it would be good if you have oily skin all over your face. * I use a retinol product and use this moisturizer on after. this is the perfect moisturizer for oily skin.  it's not too light but not too heavy. feels great. I'm on my 4th bottle and feel that the ingredients do work * I wanted something a little more intensely moisturizing for winter since it's been sunny but dry.

126,the ordinary,natural moisturizing factors + beta glucan,pimprod2039174,2609860," * The ingredients looked great, and I really wanted a lightweight gel moisturizer as mine are all too heavy, and the texture of this initially felt great. However, it is SO drying. I put this on and then 10 minutes later my face is uncomfortably dry for the rest of the day. I can't use this on its own and need to layer another moisturizer on top of it. * This product feels like Iam putting a slimy hair product on my face.  Nice feel after but you really have to wash your hands. I tried rubbing into my hands but had a ick feel. * A great product at a great price. * Been looking for a good moisturizer for my combo skin. This one hit the mark. Dont have to use that much either and it keeps my face moisturized and oil under control. * This product made my skin feel really tight, if you don't want your skin feeling tight, I would not recommend. * After purchasing this moisturizer for a second time, its a hard no. I knew it was more for oily skin so I bought the squalene oil (which is amazing!!!) to help. However after 20 minutes the moisturizer was piling from my skin. I tried using it without my other skin care products but it wss still piling. I loved how it made my skin look and feel but I couldnt wear it at all. * This product has been the ULTIMATE GAME CHANGER for my skin. I have ALWAYS had rough, dry, sensitive skin on my cheeks, with barely a little oil in my T zone. I would also get sebaceous filaments in the T zone (probably because my skin is always super super dry). 

I have tried EVERYTHING to fix this. I thought I wasn't exfoliating enough, or perhaps I simply needed to add more oil products. Everything I tried only made it worse. Then I saw this product and thought maybe what I really needed was a different tactic. Maybe instead of oil based products, I should try doing the opposite. So I grabbed this. 

Within two weeks, the red areas of my skin lightened up - I have had red blotches my entire life so right away, I know somethings up. The sebaceous filaments stopped coming back as fast. My skin stopped being so rough in texture, turning soft and smooth. I stopped needing foundation. No breakouts, nothing. My skin is practically glowing. It's also bouncier???!!

TOTAL GAME CHANGER!

I gotta say though, I was surprised because it acts like a mask more than a moisturizer but I ultimately decided to trust the process. I apply it in the morning, and unlike the oils, it doesnt get absorbed by my skin, or simply get wiped off throughout the day. So if you're expecting it to feel and act like a typical cream, you might be confused when this simply seems to dry on your face. Like I said, it's more of a mask, locking in the moisture, keeping your skin hydrated all day long. 

I put it on in the morning before I leave the house, then again right after cleansing at night before bed. I LOVE that it doesn't wipe off onto my pillow while I'm sleeping. I love that I can simply apply makeup right on top of it with zero issues and it still stays. It has even helped my under-eye area??? 

This stuff is crazy good. I wanted to know what the magic is so I looked up beta-glucan skin benefits and yup, it forms a protective barrier, increases collagen, is anti-inflammatory, and its anti-microbial. I really dont know how this one isnt a cult fave yet. 

I purchased this in store after looking at it here in the app."

Almost like I used nothing, really disapponted usually I enjoy gel moisturizers. * I was trying to find a cheap alternative and thought possibly this would work but it didnt. * I love this product. I usually buy three at a time. Ive used other big name brand products compared to this and they didnt work as good as this one. * I needed a oil free moisturizor because I have combination skin. Chose this moisturizer based on many positive reviews. I was not down this moisturizer is ideal for combination skin. I love ELF * As an oily skinned gal I usually love gel moisturizers but this is a total miss for me. It makes my skin feel dry and tight and I'd probably be better off just letting my natural oils do the work. An extra star only because it absorbs really fast and is lightweight. * I don't LOVE this moisturizer but I don't HATE it. I didn't buy this but it was given by my mom because she has oily skin and she felt like this did nothing. When she said I could have it I tried it out and at first I thought she was crazy because it was hydrating. Overtime it lost it's moisture and became very dry. I haven't seen any improvements to this and this is really the only moisturizer I have been using. I felt like over time it made my skin flakey, clogged, and dry. Disappointed, however, the packaging is very nice and the texture of the moisturizer is nice. But I felt like it did nothing. * I've never used ELF products before and was recommended this as a replacement for my First Aid Beauty coconut water moisturizer and was pleasantly suprised! I like the texture and the light scent. I feel like it has kept my skin balanced and not caused more acne and for 1/3 of the price, I love that!"
128,byoma,moisturizing gel cream spf30,pimprod2039807,2611682," * I have combination skin and have tried SO many sunscreens. They never work because they either don't rub in well, pill, or have a white cast. Not this one! It blends perfectly, wears well with makeup, and feels moisturizing! Can't recommend this enough * Its a great moisturizer that spreads evenly and blends in well, leaving a great glow on the face. BUT once makeup goes over top, it pills soooo badly. I've trued changing foundations and skin prep and it is the same result every time. * This SPF is one of my favs and I always get compliments on my skin being glowy when I wear it! 10/10 recommend. Didn't break me out either! * Not that I had irritation after this, but for my skin gel moisturizers work better, this one was heavy on the cream. I don't remember what my skincare was like back when I used this moisturizer at the end of my routine, but I just felt like it was taking forever to rub in and not really moisturizing my face. Personally felt more like a lotion than a gel cream. If this one doesn't work for you either I'd suggest Byoma's other product, the pink gel moisturizer is what I kept using after this one. * I wanted to like this. Seemed good cause its a light gel moisturizer and goes on nice.  Liked that it has spf. But once it drys on your face it pills so bad. Just makes a mess especially of your layering makeup on too. Definitely would not recommend. * I wanted to love this but it pills sooooo bad!! * I have tried so many different brands of sunscreen. I have very senstive, acne prone, oily skin. This is the first sunscreen that hasnt caused me to break out, leave a white cast, or make my skin burn. And it feels so nice on your skin."

It has left my skin feeling absolutely amazing! Obsessed with this product. * I have not worn any Lancome products besides their glosses but tried this when I was inside of Ulta then walked around the store. Omg! What a difference. The redness in my cheeks and by the corners of my nose went away. And my skin looked immediately brighter. The feel of the creme itself is SO luxurious and you only need a little bit so it will last a longer time (of course we want that with this price lol) * I love this product and ordered it online for a mother's day gift. However, I somehow got a refill, so it came in a plastic container with a tear-away foil cover and no jar. I didn't even know refills existed for this. I didn't have a container to place it in (other than using a cheap Ziploc bag), so it would have dried out. Hence, I had to return it. I'm not sure if others have had this issue, but Ulta, please be aware! * Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo my mom is a dermatologist and she loves it!!!!!!!! * I have been using this cream for about a month and a half. It feels pleasant and smells beautiful, but does not live up to its claims in my experience. My face does not feel fully hydrated by the end of the day, never mind 24 hours. I have not witnessed brightening or firming. A big selling point (and likely excuse for the huge price tag) is the Grand Rose extract, which Lancôme does a poor job explaining the benefit of. Luckily I had Ulta points to use on this cream, and not my own money. I got roped into the illusion of grandeur and prestige with this Absolue cream. Don't be like me. Much more effective and affordable creams are available on the market. Research ingredients; rose extract offers unremarkable and lackluster benefits. Perhaps the Pro-Xylane and shea butter can, but certainly not in this formulation. * This product is amazing! Expensive as heck but amazing. I originally tried this as a sample and noticed a difference from just the sample. My skin has NEVER felt so soft and smooth! Make sure to purchase when there's a 20% off code otherwise it's a lot. * Most say ""it softens the skin""  Goodness ladies, you can ""soften skin"" with products that are free of chemicals and work to soften.. A cream at this ridiculous price should do more than ""SOFTEN"".. I received a teeny tiny sample of it .. Sorry I don't believe one can see any difference whatsoever with 4 drops of a cream with a strong perfume smell.  I have sensitive skin and perfume is not something I want in a cream"

Obsessed!!! * Took me a few times to realize a tiny bit goes a long way but the scent is soooo nice!
My skin is soft and when I wake up I glow!  Ive gotten so many compliments on my skin and I recommend this product every time. 
Ive used every night the last three weeks and its really the best night cream ive had! * I love the rose collection, so I wanted to try the lotus cream. It is a nice texture in a beautiful jar, but is heavily fragranced. After one use, I woke up with a red pimple on my cheek and my pores appeared larger.  I will only use on my neck now. * As I age, I notice I need a bit more heavy face creams. However, I don't want to over do it. I'm in my late 40's and this face cream really helped me to feel youthful again. I combine it with the tea tree serum. I feel perfectly hydrated without being weighed down. * Bought the full-size jar after receiving a sample. It's a nice weight without feeling heavy or greasy. Light, pleasant scent.

I'm on my 4th bottle I like it that much!! * Recieved a sample and used on my seriously purging skin. It never irritating my sensitive skin and actually felt soothing. It took hours to ansorb into my skin and left a slightly greasy feel. I awoke this morning to very happy skin - hydrated, smooth, plump and slightly firmer. Once my current moisturizer is empty, I'll be purchasing. * This is my second time repurchasing. I hate the price but this has made a significant difference in my skin. I have sensitive dry skin and this has given my skin the moisture it needs and an amazing glow. I see others are complaining about it being ""greasy"" i havent had that issue.

I've experienced no breakouts from this product, it really soaks into my skin, and it out preforms products I've used that are 3x the price. I immediately got my brother on this (he also experiences quite a bit of acne) and he said his skin has never felt better. If you're oily, please give this a try. * As an avid moisturizer, I always love to try new products that are clean and great for the skin. This one in the beginning was good, however, overtime I found my skin becoming extremely dried out and was wondering why! I applied more of the moisturizer in hopes to re-introduced moisture, but realized in the end it was the actual moisturizer that was drying my skin out! The only way I Came to this conclusion is when I use the moisturizer by itself so I could figure out why my skin was so incredibly dry. In the end, I'm finding myself using under eye retinol in hopes to Clear my wrinkles that formed after using this moisturizer. I have never in my life had so much wrinkles under my eyes and I'm actually very shocked. I'm still trying to fix my under eye wrinkles till this day and will never purchase this product again. * Really nice lightweight moisturizer. Perfect for me when so many other moisturizers feel like they smother my skin. I use this with their serum under my makeup every day and its the perfect foundation for my foundation. Makeup stays on without my face getting shiny or oily, and using the serum, moisturizer, and cleanser has really helped clear up my skin from all the breakouts. When I stopped using it, my skin went berserk, so I'm back to using it and my skin has calmed down and started to heal again. Its really amazing stuff. * I got a sample and would always look forward to applying this on my skin so i decied to purchase a full size. Its very soothing and hydrating.

It has this water-gel like consistency but its really smooth to apply without that greasy feeling. i love how this made my skin feel however I think the snail mucin isn't personally for me.

It does not cause any irritation and is suitable for use in any weather conditions. Its texture is quite pleasant, and I would definitely recommend it to others. * This moisturizer did not absorb in to my skin and after a couple hours my skin felt dry and tight. It left a layer of cream just sitting on top of my skin. For the price, my skin should be at the very least moisturized * Fragrance is not good for the face, especially for skin of color. Fragrance is one of the leading causes of contact dermititis. It is otherwise a grear profuct, they just need to refomulate & remove the fragrance! * This is my first time using an Ester Lauder product and I'm really impressed. I never write reviews but honestly the improvement in my skin's uneven tone/hyperpigmentation and fine lines- especially on my neck, have  improved considerably.

I've tried it with different serums and oils - no matter what combo I try, it pills terribly. Today, since I had no plans to leave the house, I decided to try it without any other product. You guessed it....it still pills, not as much as when it's combined, but annoyingly nonetheless. I'm quite disappointed. * I really tried liking this product, I've absolutely loved all my PTR products and never had a bad experience but the smell is extremely unpleasant and th product pills like crazy. I originally tried this as a face moisturizer under my Supergoop makeup primer and noticed the pilling and originally though it was a reaction between ingredients so I switched to using it at night and when I used my face oil on top I had the same problem with pilling. if I put any product on top of this moisturizer it always pills up and I have to try to wipe my face after application. I have used different moisturizers under my makeup primer and face oils and have never encountered this problem. Moisturizer is never my final step in my skin care routine morning or evening so it is extremely difficult to use and not have it pill up. I have to skip steps to be able to use this moisturizer and if the smell and texture/consistency blew me away I would consider it but it overall leavs me super disappointed. Will honestly just end up throwing out what I have not happy with the product at all, I can easily find much better results and moisturizers overall * I have very sensitive skin and have been trying to find a product that works for me for so long!

141,l'orÃ©al,revitalift triple power anti-aging moisturizer - fragrance free,pimprod2009091,2554031," * Very cooling, moisturizer, and good for my skin. * L'Oreal Paris Triple Power Face and Neck SPF 30 is a decent, affordable everyday moisturizer with SPF 30. It hydrates well and is readily available. However, it can feel heavy, has a noticeable fragrance, and doesn't produce dramatic anti-aging results. Best for normal to dry skin, it's a good option if you prioritize affordability and sun protection.  If you have oily or sensitive skin, or dislike fragrance, consider other options. * L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Face and Neck Moisturizer SPF 30 with Pro-Retinol, Vitamin C & Hyaluronic acid is perfectly packaged. With its thick moisturizing consistency I'd say it's a little thicker than anticipated and took some getting used to. Also, I'm an extremely sensitive skinned person that breaks out easily with some scents & comedogenic products. After several weeks of usage I did feel it smoothed my neck, however I did experience some breakouts on my face. I would probably use this product as more of a summertime SPF than a daily moisturizing cream. * 'LOreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer, Pro Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin C to Reduce Wrinkles, Firm & Brighten Skin really does what it claims and MORE! I use this in the morning after I wash my face, but before applying my foundation for the day. It's an integral part of my routine to also use this in the evening after I remove my makekup for the day, but before bed. This leaves my skin hydrated yet moisturized, but also acts as a solid base for my foundation making it not only stretch farther but also moisturizing my skin and helping with fine lines and wrinkles that come with aging. I LOVE the versatility of this product and its light scent. This is one of my most favorite staples and I highly recommend L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer, Pro Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin C to Reduce Wrinkles, Firm & Brighten Skin. Give it a try, I think you'll love it. * Don't be fooled by the little jar, this cream packs a lot of punch. One of the best things about it, is that it pulls double duty as a day cream with the SPF and night cream. Using it at night gives the skin that little bit of extra moisture needed for night time. I can definitely see a difference in my skin after using this for almost a month.  I was given this product in exchange for an honest review * Such a perfect day cream! I received this product about a month ago and have been consistently using it day and night. Even in the winter, I can go all day and night with my skin not only feeling baby smooth soft, and not greasy or shiny. When putting it on, I was struck by the thickness of the cream, yet it slides on easily and just melts into the skin. I am so happy it has spf 30, so I feel confident using it during the daytime. It doesn't roll on the skin, and also does not make my makeup slip off. I could barely smell a scent, and it just lifts up the face and gives it a nice, subtle glow. I also noticed a marked improvement in the texture on my neck. Love it!! * I received This free in exchange for my honest review. This one now replace my much more expensive lotion. It has wonderful ingredients and left my skin feeling so smooth. Blurred my lines and pores. I love the scent of this. I will definitely be repurchasing this. Works much better than the more expensive brand."

This helped clear that up in about a week. My skin feels very hydrated and much happier. * Great moisturizer! * I have cancer and I get radiation treatments 5 days a week. By week 5 my underbelly was super bright red. It looked exactly like the time I sat in the sun all day every day for two weeks straight in Hawaii when I was 15 years old. Quite a nasty sunburn but this one didn't hurt. The nurses told me to use Aquaphor, but 3 days of Aquaphor did nothing at all, so I bought this hoping it would do something better than nothing. I slept with it overnight and the morning after it was half as red and looking really good. I now have a newfound respect for Oatmeal as an active ingredient. * I have been using this for years but since they changed the formula I developed a rash around my eyes and rashes on my face. I opened a new tube and within a few hours of using my skin burned and felt like tickling on my face. Definitely not for senitive skin!!! * I have been using this for years but since they changed the formula I developed a rash around my eyes and rashes on my face.

I love how my skin feels with this product. I get so many compliments on my skin. It makes my skin glow and helps with my fine lines. * I've gotten so many compliments on my skin as soon as I started using this. It works really well with other products as well so it's the perfect ending to my am/pm skin routine. * I love this so much along with facelift and neck cream * Feels good and I look forward to my day and nightly routine now.  It's been 1 week and I already see and feel the changes in my skin. * I wish I would have bought multiples during the big sale. This cream is ideal as a night cream. It makes my skin soft, bright and plump. The consistency of this cream is also ideal for the neck area! This definitely my top 3 face creams. * I am almost 55 and this stuff is amazing. It pairs well with makeup and gives your skin a glow! I can't live without this product. Also, there is a definite noticable difference!!! I wish this was gifted- but this an honest opinion!! * I love this product and have been using it for years. It makes your skin feel so hydrated and it minimizes fine lines.  I am in my 60's and if I don't use this product I can definitely notice a difference.  This product was not gifted to me by strivectin though I wish it was."
144,strivectin,super-c spf 30 vitamin c moisturizer,pimprod2022788,2574715," * I love how moisturizing this is but that where the good vibes stop. It smells like sunscreen and burns my eyes!  I use a separate eye cream so it shouldn't be getting into my eyes but some how it still does. I wish I could love it but I've found something less creamy that acts more like a primer and doesn't make my eyes burn and water all day 😢 * Makes my skin look beautiful! * And gave me a bad taste in my mouth. Going back to Mario Badescu. Not worth the extra sun protection. * This is a great one step. Works well for dry or combo skin. Love the texture. Its also THD Ascorbate. * nice * I am a redhead with freckles and sun/age spots. I bought this cream to use on ny face both for the SPF and to fade freckles. My skin had some sensitivity issues a couple weeks after I started using the product - redness, small blisters and peeling. It might've been this product, might not, but i still have not recovered. Waited too long to return it and so I started using on my neck and chest without issues. I wear a lot of V-neck tops, and noticed my freckles and dark spots faded surprisingly quickly! I'm not sure if I will buy it again, but it DOES work. On the downside it has an unpleasant citrus scent. Im not usually bothered by scents but I'm not fond of this one. * Left my skin greasy and shiny but did not moisturize my skin. Would not recommend to use, did not see any improvement in my skin just felt like putting oily sun screen on my face."

It is nice and light, great for daytime or nighttime wear. It absorbs so nicely and my skin feels super hydrated! * I've been trying to replace my Tatcha water cream bc its so expensive. This one, although not a dupe, is a good replacement. It leaves my skin soft, glowy, & hydrated. Be careful if you have oily skin… you only need the tiniest dime-sized amount… the jar could last you forever. If you use too much it could become oily and heavy. * Anything philosophy I love, so when I saw this it was a must try. It is AMAZING. Makes my skin feel amazing, the scent is amazing, I will be buying again! * Hope in a jar is a great product. Never used it for years. It's unfortunate that the price has sky rocketed * I love this moisturizer, but not the price lol. I managed to snag it during the 21 Days of Beauty and since I had a gift card I got it for cheap. It leaves my face feeling hydrated, but not sticky or heavy. * I've been looking for a good moisturizer and I think I finally found it!  I got this on the Ulta beauty steals 50% off sale.  I hope it goes on sale again! * Best gel like face cream ever. Works fabulous under makeup."
147,dime,dewy day cream: rosehip + tremella,pimprod2039423,2612541," * I use the full Dime skincare line, and it's the best I've ever used. I'm 58 and needed a change about a year ago as I started to see changes in my skin. I also wanted to start using a clean product line. I found Dime, and it's been amazing. The Dewy Day cream is in fact dewy! I often start applying this and hear myself say outloud, ""Ahhhh."" It just feels so good going on and does it's job well. Perfect for daytime and under makeup. * I dislike fragrances and for some reason, it is difficult to find skincare without it.
This brand is my new go-to.  It is light, dewy, and does what i need it to do.  I also love the price. * I've used this moisturizer a few times. So far I'm liking it, it goes on smoothly and doesn't feel sticky. * I love the sleek, black packaging. However, I do not understand all the good reviews.  I have extremely oily skin, and this ""dewy"" cream made my skin very dry and tight every time I used it. I very much prefer the dewy skin cream from Tatcha. * Im almost done with it and can say that im disappointed it was not hydrating. I put a good amount too to make sure and nothing. I really liked the toner so i wanted to try the day cream but i honestly didnt like it. For the price you could spend the same or spend a little more and get a better product * I've tried many many moisturizers over the years ranging from $45-$200 and this one is my absolute favorite! It'll be the one i get from hear on out. Im 49 and in my llayer year have experienced dry skin. Which looks like old skin . But this moisturizer is so good my skin looks younger! * I recently had almost a chapped texture to my skin I'm not really sure why but this cream is so hydrating it took care of all the issues I was having. A little goes such a long way. I have pretty sensitive/combination skin."
148,beautystat cosmetics,universal c skin refiner 20% vitamin c brightening serum,pimprod2030149,2592489," * I wanted to like this but the prodcut has shimmer in it and there is no reason why an eyecream should have shimmer in it. Also the dispensor is really bad the product is runny so when you press the pump you get wayyy more prodcut then you need so your wasting product, lastly the product stinged my eyes. * I purchased the serum in spring. It is sticky, also hard to spread evenly. Doesn't work with moisturizer or foundation. The residue on finger looks like a thin pale film. Hard to dispense from the bottle. Suggest to improve the packaging. Do not recommend. * The formula has a gritty texture which irritates my sensitive skin (burns), but it's light enough and easy to apply * Used twice and threw away. Silicone like texture is a no for me. Hate the way it feels on my skin, like it sits on top rather than soak in. * I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. This is a bit on the denser, lotion side and has a light to fair, skintone coloration. I feel the color of it gives a brightening appearance to my under eye areas. It does make my skin feel rather silky soft and hydrated. I haven't seen any permanent results as far as lightening goes, as I've only been using this for 2 weeks. Happily I haven't had any uncomfortable sensation, nor any irritation from this Vitamin C product. * I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. This has a slightly denser type of lotion consistency. I can feel a slight tingle with this sometimes in weakened areas of my skin. But, it's slight and quickly dissipates. I did have some pilling in the beginning, but adjusted my other products and that alleviated the issue. As far as how it makes my skin feel, not greasy, definitely refined more than prior to my 2 weeks of use at this point. I cannot attest to brightening attributes at this short time of usage. I have not experience any skin irritation issues from the use of this product. * All the different purposes this BeautyStat Universal C Skin Refiner Brightening Vitamin C Serum can be used for is great! It's also wonderful how much pure vitamin c is in it, that it is fragrance free, and can be applied to all types of skin! At the same time though it also contains many harmful, toxic ingredients that unfortunately makes it not safe and cancels out its benefits. If It was made without those ingredients and with only natural, healthy ones then it would be perfect and super helpful!"

I little goes a long way and  it completely covers my face with delightfuly dewy hydration. * This product is HEAVILY scented snd burned my sensitive skin. Its a no for me. * This moisturizer does hydrate but there's some pretty big cons. 
-Not for oily skin. Leaves the skin very oily a few hours after application.
- Not non comedogenic. Caused a lot of new breakouts.
- Fragrance is strong * I got this in a travel size in a gift set and was excited to use it on a long weekend trip. As soon as I opened the packaging, I was hit with the aggressive smell of this product and was transported back to my grandmother applying her heavily scented products in my youth. Since I had no other moisturizer with me, I used it and my combo acne prone skin informed me that I had offended it with the noxiously scented product. My skin was irritated and my husband, who has the worst sense of smell ever, could smell this product through a couple layers of product.

So needless to say, I do not recommend this product. * I had a bad experience with this cream. I have used this brand for many years because its products are made with high-quality ingredients, and it always tries to take care of the skin. But this cream, besides having a horrible and extremely strong smell, filled my face with pimples, made me look like a teenager, and dried out some areas of my face. It was a total disappointment. * loved the way it made my skin feel
but can't get past the strong fragrance * The texture of the cream is very light. I like how it applies smoothly on the skin. But it has a strong baby powder smell and it makes my skin look so greasy after a while."

I feel so much more confident as a 24 yo in my aging skin. Gentle and effective. Love avene products! Just the best * Let me start off saying I really DO like this! I have 36yo DRY skin and I was getting a little peeling and dry patches from my Rx Tret. once a week, but had zero irritation using this every night! It's a pretty thick cream consistency so not the easiest to spread on its own IMO. I like to use a serum before this Retrinal .5% to help it glide on the skin easier. One pump usually does it, but sometimes I add just a tiny bit more if I feel like I didn't get even coverage. It's definitely a long term product so don't expect immediate results. I DO wish Ulta carried the 1.0 version of this instead of just the .5%. * I just bought this product and I am loving it. I can't speak on results yet but as someone with oily/acne prone  skin, I feel like I finally found an anti-aging product that absorbs well and doesn't break me out. It may feel slightly ""heavy"" at first but it absorbs. Great for sensitive skin, as well! So happy I found this brand * I tried a couple of retinal creams, and had breakouts and/or burning. Having used many Avene products with great results, I took their skin quiz online, and this product was recommended. It is a great alternative to retinol, at a very low dosage so you can start to build use. I've had great success with it, and it is helping with fine lines around my eyes. I can use it every night with absolutely no irritation."

It did! I have sensitive skin, both oily and dry if that makes sense. This product goes on smoothly, blends in vs. typical sunscreens that never seem to soak into the skin. I will say I noticed a pretty strong scent of sunscreen when I first opened it. Now, just a few days later, I don't notice it at all. I love how this makes my skin feel hydrated but not oily.

My face started stinging and itching after the second use and it doesnt go on as smooth. * i loved this product for so long, but didnt realize that it what was breaking me out. i tried a different cleanser, added an exfoliater etc. NOTHING would get rid of the harsh bumps all over my face. not until i researched and found out it had safflower it in which (can) support fungal acne. i have dry, sensitive acneic skin so this may work for others but definitely not for me. very disappointed and wish i found out sooner. not even 3 days after stopping this product, my skin is clearing up. * I used to be a big fan of the Superscreen Daily Moisturizer, and although they kept the packaging the same, they changed the formula and the name to Superscreen Hydrating Daily Cream. I think brands should be more transparent about informing their customers that they're actually buying a different product than what they're used to. The consistency of the new cream is thicker and harder to spread, but what stands out the most to me is the smell: somewhere in between Play-Doh and generic baby sunscreen. My partner has sensitive skin around his eyes, and the old formula didn't cause him any burning, but the new one does. I wouldn't buy this again. * I bought this because it had avobenzone but no octocrylene (at the time). Great texture but I reacted badly to something in it. Guessing it was the algae because I've used the other ingredients before without issue."

Felt very similar to the Tula Dew Your Thing moisturizer. I never woke up with any breakouts when I used this at night. However, I don't know if this would be suitable for somone with acne as I feel like it does just sit on the skin. * So many people like this product but i dont know why. I put it on and it feels nice at first but then within the hour I'm dry again and its like i didnt put any moisturizer on at all. I tested this out for 2 weeks and my face feels rough, its like this ruined the texture. So weird. * why would u guys change something so good it makes no sense at all, never buying again the new formula is not nearly as good * I love the moisturizer so much i bought the larger size * This moisturizer is great! * I been using Neutrogena products almost 20 years and always coming back for it for moisture. * I have a super dry skin as well as eczema and this is the first moisturizer that is so mild without causing any issue as well as keeping my skin fresh and vibrant throughout the day!

I LOVE IT!!! It blends GREAT (especially for a product with SPF), isn't greasy, doesn't make my skin oily or shiny, has not caused a breakout, and I can see a clear difference in the moisture level of my skin in just a few days. Anti-aging creams normally make my skin totally freak out, but this one is all good, no bad. Really glad I happened upon it! * This contains Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene....FYI * I joke that this is my old lady face cream because it smells like a bouquet of roses. However, it really does give the skin a lifted appearance and tightened feel. The daytime version has some SPF and wears nice under makeup. I wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin because of the fragrance. Also, I noticed on very dry winter days the product does not have enough moisture for my skin * I received this as a sample size from Estee Lauder and I can't wait to buy a full size. This is why I love samples, It lets me fiind out what I love without spending a fortune first.  It has the faintest fragrance that is subtle but lovely. It goes on so smooth and is just pleasant to use. My only complaint is the price. Some of us would buy this brand more often if we weren't priced out of the market. This is why I gave it a four. Otherwise, a five all the way. * This smells like febreeze and it doesn't go away when you rub it in :( save your monies * I use this product daily.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. It did not irritate my skin, which can sometimes be an issue for me.  Makeup base glides on smoothly over this moisturizer.  It is my absolute favorite. * I wish I could use this product as it seems to work well. However the fragrance is too strong and irritating."

For this price there must be something better out there! * I use this morning and night along with the face and eye serum (same brand) followed by sunscreen (only in the morning). I can truly say that this stuff along with the face and eye serum works. I used to have very dry skin, but not anymore. Also, the hormonal acne I get occasionally is under control. Lastly, the wrinkles are diminishing. Totally worth every penny. * I see smoother skin , brighter skin , less fine lines and an overall younger look * I do love this product, it's true to all things advertised - A little bit goes a long way as I purchased this a few months ago and still have more than half of it left. I did not want to write a review until I was certain I was satisfied based off of the huge expense...

I say this because i am bukachiol exclusively and if that is you, this review is for you. I am a skin care junkie, although a clean formula must haver because i am skin sensitive and have extreme sensitivities. I tend toward high end brands but i always, always come back to cocokind and the ressurection cream is hands down the only rivh cream i bother to buy after trying a lot of other high end clean beauty brands. That's it, that's the bottom line. This is my holy grail. There's some other things that perform just as well but they do not have the volume or price. There's just no reason to iverspend when this is EVERYTHING. I can agree the texture is incredibly thick but also, i think if you are using wo much that the tecture is bothering you or it won't absorb, you are using tooooo much. It doesn't take a lot! I used this year round, but especially in the winter. * This is ok. I thought id love it, but i dont. The texture is not amazing or luxurious. Its a little weird. It doesnt give the greatest experience to apply, but it works. Its moisturizing without being greasy, and is not dewy at all but actually matte.

It is so lightweight on my skin! When I have my makeup on and I use this to take it off with it doesn't work the best!! If you use something with it like a wash cloth it works a lot better!! * It's good and cleans well, but I prefer a setting cleanser. It burns my sensitive skin. * I am thinking its similar cerave acne cleaner but this cleancer break my skin so badddddd * I have oily combo skin and this left my face SUPER ""shiny"". I wouldn't say greasy but it looked like it 🥲. It isn't really foamy either. So I'd say it's probably too stripping for anyone with my skin type. Just didn't work well with my skin unfortunately. I returned it for a different product. * When I first bought this product, I thought it was gonna wear good on my face because you know foaming cleanser works very good on oily skin which I have. so when I first bought it, I used it then the next day I started feeling like my skin and very irritating and like kind of burning when it felt like my skin was like a little like oily like real oily. And then I have bumps all of my cheeks, and I felt like my pores were clogged very bag. So I threw the shelf in the trash and then I went to go use my regular soap, which is turmeric soap, but my turmeric soap doesn't really help. But yeah thats all.

We noticed that her wrinkles looked smoother after a few uses and what a healthy glow. Will buy again. * The cream never settled into the skin and made my skin feel dryer. Also, makeup did not apply nicely after it was on. * At first i liked it, but this product is extremely overpriced. I didnt notice a difference in my skin and it started to smell awful after a month * Hands up the best moisturizer for dry, aging skin. Incredible all-around. * I did a ton of research snd was super excited to try this eye cream. I have very dark circles around my eyes and I was thinking this product would help with that. Unfortunately when i put it on, it makes the skin around my eyes buuuurrrrn. My eyes also arent that much more moisturized for such a thick cream. If you have sensetive skin, dont buy, its burns and is too expensive to try. 

Also, the deeper i dug, the more reviews i found that were written by people who were traded the product for free in return for a product review. Should have done more research…."

Have used it a couple years now.  Non-reactive on my sensitive skin and feels wonderful on.  I believe it has made a difference in the texture of my skin and improved my neck wrinkles. * Finding the right skin care routine is never linear since it varies person per person. I have sensitive combination skin and I always struggled to find a product that didnt give me that greasy glow. 

This product is light yet hydrating enough that it doesnt require a lot of product. While the price tad is high, the big container last me 2-3 months depending on the weather. 

I would recommend you get a sampler size and try it out for 3 months because you wont see any instant results. After 6 months of using this product, it cleared my blackhead and slowly seeing results in other areas. * I have been using this multi corrective face cream since its arrived on the market, Im 52, it has been a game changer since i traded up from their daily moisturizer( in which i stared at 30. It doing what it needs to do, im not getting wrinkles or dry skin and i use it alone & under make up. I'm often asked if im 35 so i have to give some credit to kehls for it. I love the line, its fine quality and i will never waver! * I bought this after many great reviews. I used it around 10 times and thought it was sunburn because I was red and sore. I switched to e45 then another brand and I was fine. I then tried it again after a couple of weeks and it stung my face again! I usually don't have sensitive skin and I'm gutted I spent so much and now can't use it * Every single thing on my face 'balls up' when I use this moisturizer, including when I use it alone.  It does not absorb into my skin, but just sits on top. I've tried it in so many combinations and it's just incompatible with other skin care and foundations (I've tried several foundations -high end & low end- with same results).  I've also tried using it with serums, different primers, different sunscreens and alone with the same result. This is a hard pass for me."

It makes me look so pale. I am so surprised given the price and the fact it is supposed to be a ""daily moisturizer."" Would not waste your money. * I loved the fact that it had hyaluronic acid and SPF in one, but after putting it on, I realize it's definitely not for me. I hoped the reviews were wrong, but it definitely leaves a white cast over your skin, and made me look super pale, despite the fact that I have a fair, medium skin tone. * I have tried almost every mineral sunscreen under the sun. I'm fair skin, freckles, burn easily, break out easily and this sunscreen moisturizer has been amazing. There is a white cast initially but I rub the product between my fingers before applying and it blends within 5 minutes! I never get sunburn on my face while wearing this.

It's very, very light, so it doesn't turn into an oily mess, but it's moisturizing enough so that my skin doesnt feel tight/dry after application. I love it. And to top it off, it's not too expensive. The search for a good moisturizer is over. God bless. * I like this product. Very good moisturizing for my skin. Doesn't cause break outs. It's a little sticky, but if you plan to put a product over it, it is not at all noticeable. Barely noticeable anyways, just worth mentioning. * This is such an amazing product!  I only make enough to buy the smaller size, but even that small size will last me almost a month, because it only takes a small amount to go over my whole face every night. * I have sensitive, combination, and acne prone skin. I have been using this moisturizer for the past 6 years and noticed a significate improvement in my skins overall health a few months into using this product. I love that it is fragrance free as well. * The original Neutrogena water gel mositruizer didn't work for me because of the fragrance. I'm very happy to see this mositurizer in a fragrance free version! This is a great moisturizer  for oily, sensitive skin. Its provides great hydration and is lightweight, non-irritating, non-comedogenic, and affordable. The new glass jar is a nice touch to make the product feel a bit more elevated. * I used the water gel for years, because it was the only affordable moisturizer I could find that didn't make me break out.

It does not go on the skin smoothly. It leaves a greasy sticky residue on my fingers. Since using it, I have not seen or felt any skin benefits. I have stopped using this and prefer my Elemis collagen spf cream instead. * Only moisturizer that doesn't stuff up my nose. I tried clinique also and couldn't use it. Love their products. * New favorite! Absolutely love how the texture of this moisturizer changes as you rub it in. It melts down almost like water, really feels like your skin took a huge drink of H2O. It does take a while to sink in though, so if dewy finishes aren't your thing I'd pass on it. Best for nighttime use. * Better than the expensive stuff by a landslide. Ive been using this and gifting this to family and friends for many years. Nothing compares. * I have combination skin. This did not break me out. I love how the texture changes once you start to rub it in. However, i wish it absorbed into the skin more completely. My skin feels tacky after using this, so my hair sticks to it. Oversll good tho! * This was recommended by a black dermatologist over a year ago.  I use it in combination with the vit C serum, any Vit C serum will work.  I absolutely LOVE the way this both looks and FEELS on my skin.

Super gentle on the skin and great for sensitive skin as well. * I have rosacea 1. When it flares up, my cheeks get very red, irritated, hot, and become super sensitive to topicals. This product makes my cheeks feel itchy and the green tint is super patchy in coverage. Does it his some redness? Sure…but my face looks blotchy. 

I previously tried a sample of the rossliac cream from my dermatologist and it was too thick and this is only slightly better in texture. * I wanted to give this green tinted moisturizer a shot since I have a mild form of rosacea, where my skin turns red from the littlest bit of sun exposure or high tenperatures. After applying, it didn't moisturize at all, the green pigment clung to dry patches on my skin highlighting them, and even though its frangrance free it had an overbearing scent of milk from a jug. Sadly had to return it. * My MIL who is a dermatologist gave me this moisturizer.  My skin is extremely sensitive and i also have a bit of rosacea.  Texture is a bit thick but it doesnt leave resedue like others mentioned and it does mouturize the skin well.

Unlike the cleanser which is light, smells great and leaves skin feeling fresh, this moisturizer is thick, feels heavy on your face, and smells like artificial fruit. Also, the pump is terrible. * This moisturizer is absolutely amazing! My face is so soft and hydrated, I couldn't believe it. The smell is light and fruity. I'm so happy I gave it a try. * Though I do love the way this lotion feels on my skin, I won't purchase this again unless the packaging changes. It feels cheap and only works about 2/3 of the time.

This was the first time I've used a moisturizer by Coola. I've heard a lot about this brand and have always been curious about this company. Anyways this moisturizer was smooth, comfy, and lightweight on the skin. I love the fact it has sunscreen and it's a 2 in 1 product. This cream isn't too greasy on my skin and is easily absorbed, usually, when I wear sunscreen it is clear so I don't have to deal with a white cast and greasiness. My skin felt refreshed and awake when I used this. I love that it has water-like hydration, anti-pollution, and digital de-stress. These are some of the ingredients that I haven't in any other products before. Plus it is cruelty-free, vegan, and antioxidant-enriched. * I'm absolutely thrilled with this sunscreen, and I love that it's vegan, clean, and cruelty-free. One of the standout features for me is its incredibly lightweight texture, which leaves no white flashback or residue on my skin. It glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly, without any greasy or sticky feeling. Another huge plus is that it's fragrance-free, which is perfect for my sensitive skin. Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with this sunscreen and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality, eco-friendly option.""Product was received as part of an educational promotion."" * I LOVE this stuff! Very high SPF, and it's sanitary because it comes out through a pump at the top rather than needing to stick your fingers in a jar. I have ~normal to slightly dry skin, and I LOVE the moisture and glow it gives, without or with makeup on top. I do wish there was a way to open it at the end to get the remaining product that the pump won't squeeze out though.. otherwise 5/5 fully recommend.

This creme not only made my skin feel smooth and hydrated, but also looks more radiant. * While I received a free product from RoC, I definitely am not being compensated for this and wanted to share that I did love the product. The retinol correction max daily feels amazinng on my skin and my skin overall feels softer and more supple after using it for a month. I didn't notice any changes the first 2 weeks but after a full month, I am loving how my skin is feeling. * The texture was good. The smell was not strong, but I like it. The effect was excellent! My skin is dry. I could feel it affected on my skin only one day.

I apply it mostly at nights and make sure to apply spf in the morning. * I really enjoy the texture of this creme, and I love how it has left my skin both feeling and looking. I have hard water, and my skin has been really showing it lately. This has helped a lot. I've had no irritation, and found no noticeable scent which usually bother me.

I'm extremely pale with a lot of redness and this made me look orange and it felt really heavy on my skin. Made my makeup peel. So disappointed. Do not recommend. * I have a pretty fair skinton, with pink undertones and oddly enough sometimes I use this as foundation. It gives you a clear and smoother looking skin and feels weightless. Once you put the  product on yohr face irs green but once you rub it into your skin it turns into your skin tone and I would say it does cover up redness pretty nicely, not all the way put like 80% covers red spots (minor pimples, and such) it also last up to 8 hours and is buildable/wearable with makeup products such as concealer. * I purchased this, however I have rosacea it did not assist in helping color correct my skin at all. Waste of my money wish I had been able to find the receipt so I could take it back. Empty promises just like most color correcting cosmetics. * Attn pale people - this will not work for you. I should have read the reviews. It has potential and will be beautiful if you are light to medium toned. * This goes on green and adapts to your perfect skin color to cover up redness and soothe. I absolutely love it. * I have rosacea and this is a godsend. This blends into the skin so seamlessly. Sometimes color correctors will make my skin look dry or the pigment will sit in my huge pores and I hate that. Perfect to spot treat just my cheeks. I like that this is skin care rather than makeup, because I have acne prone skin so I try my best to keep my skin care minimal. 10/10 I recommend * This rescue balm by Hero works great on my periodic rosacea. It blends in well and matches my skin perfectly. It's not heavy, but covers well, making it a great addition to my daily make up routine. This balms starts out green then turns skin toned. This works great under my concealer, making sure no redness peeks through. It's a good value too. A little goes a long way."

I love the dewy finish on my skin, but I wouldn't recommend for oily girls. This has Propolis at the very top of the ingredient list, so you know you're getting all the benefits for an affordable price. Not to mention it's fragrance free! I pair this with a peptide eye cream & it has diminished my fine lines * In lieu of my 5 star rating, this product sadly ended up in my ""can't use"" category. I absolutely loved EVERYTHING about the whole Propolis line, but unforturnately Propolis is an allergen tested during an allergy patch test and mine showed a trace reaction which my allergist informed me to avoid any allergens even if it is only a trace. This could be an issue for people who have sensitive skin. I have to say that other than being a possible irritant or allergy to some, this moisturizer is a really great consistency and lives up to all the expectations that it claims to have. As with any product that is new to your skin, proceed with caution and do a patch test. Its worth knowing :) * I love the toner and serum in this line but for whatever reason this lotion is just waaay too much for me. It would irritate my exzema and cause small/minor breakouts. I have dry/reactive/acne prone skin so moisturizers are a challenge for me * My skin loves it! My pores look smooth, its calming & hydrating without looking greasy. A little goes a long way. * I LOVE THIS! My skin took around a week to really settle into this as my face reacts to new things. However once i got into the routine of using this, my pores look smooth, my skin is plump, and is overall hydrating without looking greasy. It also calms down the redness I have on my cheeks. A little goes a long way. I finally found a moisturizer that works for me."

This fall and winter I was able to avoid that all together with daily applications. Also the jar is kinda huge. I bought another jar about 2 months too early because I thought I had reached the bottom of my first jar. * Very hydrating and gentle formula. Your skin will have a health glow. * I have dry skin with psoriasis. No fragrance, feels luxurious, and keeps my skin really hydrated throughout the day.

I use it daily as my skin prep before makeup. It keeps my skin so hydrated under foundation!! * This is perfect to moisturize the skin before applying makeup. Leaves your skin glowing and hydrated before foundation * This is the key to flawless makeup! I've used countless moisturizers and primers, and have never been quite happy with how my makeup blended on top. I wish I would have tried this sooner, but it was worth the wait. I have combo skin, and this is so smooth and hydrating, but not heavy or greasy. The smoothness is what makes me love how my foundation blends on top. I like a matte finish foundation, but they tend to be too drying and look dry on my skin. Not anymore! I get the smoothest, most plush looking effect from this moisturizer and my makeup looks better than ever!

I've been using this combo since 2023 through two pregnancies and already acne prone skin. It keeps breakouts at bay while brightening my skin. NO PILLING. :) * So clean and light, it absorbs so well without fully disappearing. Leaves skin feeling clean and not greasy . * Probably one of the beat skincare products I've ever used. Wish I could afford to keep it in stock."
183,peach & lily,rescue party barrier comfort cream,pimprod2042702,2617478," * I dont have very senstive skin but i had a reaction to anothet product that caused my skin to become flaky and very dehydrated. Since this was advertised as something to restore skin barriers and comfort the skin, i busted it out. Boy, it doesn't comfort my skin at all. It makes my skin sting and red, while not being moisturizing. It also has a smell that smells as though it went bad…very plasticky smell that is heavy. I'll be using the rest of the product on my body as it does nothing for my skin and smells horrible. * Let's get the smell out of the way: it actually reminds me of clay masks. But it's not like I can smell it more than 3 minutes after applying, so even if I didn't like it (I don't mind it), it wouldn't matter too much.

More importantly, this stuff has SAVED my skin. I had tried so many creams and yet every time I would put on makeup, the little dry flakey patches on my forehead would be highlighted. After using this only a couple of times I noticed I stopped seeing those patches.

It feels really thick and soothing but it doesn't sit annoyingly on top of my skin. I've used it after IPL and felt not even a ghost of a sting. It helped me heal quickly after spending too long in the sun. Seriously if you have dehydrated skin issues or need a bump of soothing, gentle care this is your cream.

If I had a gripe I guess it would be that I wish it came with more product for the price. But it lasts longer for me because I only use it at night. * I purchased this when looking for a creamy moisturizer to help battle the dry winter air. I do like the texture but it did make me break out. It does smell a tad funky - reminded me of rancid oil similar to expired essential oils or nuts - but it's not too strong to be a deal breaker. I'll use it as a hand cream to finish the jar. * This has transformed my skin for the better. It has significantly helped the texture and my rosacea. The smell just smells like unscented cream and is unoticeable once you apply it. * It really helped my sensitive skin come back to its healthy stage 
Will keep using * Love this product.  I use it everyday to keep my face feeling and looking healthy! * My friend gave me this cause of the smell but it honestly doesn't bother me. Its not even an awful smell its just an awkward smell. You wont smell it after its on your face. Other than that, its very hydrating my skin looks and feels amazing after applying. Very glass skin like. Definitely does what it says it does!!"
184,osea,atmosphere protection cream,pimprod2017698,2570072," * I decided to buy this and try it out because I have heard awesome things about this brand and im OBSESSED! This is for sure going to be a staple in my house from now on! It smells like a baby and my skin is so soft! * Gives me HORRIBLE acne. Im not very acne prone but everytime I use this my face will breakout in unusual places for the next few days. * ive been using this since january 2024 & i love it so much! i got a free sample of the atmosphere cream and it def made me want the larger size. For referance i used to use the neutrogena hydroboost moisturizer haha this stuff is 10x better. Although it is a bit pricey I think its totally worth it. My skin glows like no other! I dont wear makeup so its important for my skin to be on 10 at all times. I also have combo skin and it doesnt make me feel oily or anything. Lastly, I bought the bottle at the beginning of April and its now Sept and ill probably buy another by the end of this month.. so the money goes a long way!! * I enjoyed using the product, the packaging is really good. It has a really nice smell without being strong. The only thing I don't like is that it's a bit pricey for the quantity. * They changed the formula and the smell is completely different. I used to love this product because it smelled like a spa. The new formula also does not feel as rich on the skin. This will be my last bottle. Too pricey and it is near impossible to get the last 1/4 of the product out of the jar, * I purchased this cream and overnight cream for my face along with the body lotion ..WELL
They all smell the same overnight and Day facial cream is the same to me 
I spent over $100.00 on two facial products are the same .
won't buy it again * Lightweight, smells great and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin."
185,clarins,hydra-essentiel silky moisturizer with double hyaluronic acid,pimprod2037565,2606367," * My skin is sensitive to breakouts. Usually when I use a very hydrating cream, I get pimples all over. This is the only cream that consistently gives me amazing results. No breakouts ever and applies like butter - super luxurious feeling (been using for a year now). So many other popular brands clog my pores badly. My skin stays clear with this and will continue to purchase for a long time. * i used this cream for months and it was perfect for my skin. Then they reformulate and now i can't use it al all. It gives me breakouts like I've never had before.  The same thing happened with the pink jar set. * My sensitive face started getting bumpy, red, and itchy after the first week of use. I threw it away. * This is my favorite cream. I have dry skin that occasionally (monthly)breaks out. This makes my skin feel so nice and my foundation goes on like a dream! I love the light scent as well. 10 out of 10! * Lighter than extra firming but felt sticky when used after toning. Heavy fragrance not good for sensitive skin flared my rosacea. Did make my dry skin soft but returning this one, * I love the fragrance.  I did t find it overwhelming.  I also like how quickly absorbs into the skin and doesn't have yhat greasy feel after on the tace.  I typically layer this with serums.  I tried it in the colder dry months and makes my skin feel  hydrated. * I had been use this product over 20 years 
It worked very good on my skin."
186,peter thomas roth,firmx collagen moisturizer,pimprod2014564,2561084," * Im really surprised by the negative reviews. I got a sample of this cream ans love how my skin feels ans looks when i use it. The price is exorbitant and is the only thing keeping me from making it my usual night cream (i work in retail so it takea half a shift to pay for it). I'll jusy have to watch for sales! * I bought the collagen cream to replace collagen masks. I am very pleased with the results after just a few days. After cleansing and toning, I massage a small amount into my skin. I allow it to dry completly and then use Philosohy Miracle Worker face cream over top of it. This gives me smooth, glass skin all day. My skin texture has markedly improved since adding the collagen cream. It is key to properly massage the collagen cream in and letting it dry before adding the second cream. I do not wear makeup, so I cannot speak to how it would layer. * I was really excited to try this and after a few weeks notice no results. * Leaves my skin soft. Will repurchase * I blend this with the  prayer Thomas water drench sheet tint moisturizer. Blends great! Firms my skin and doesn't feel greasy or heavy.  I use this as a foundation.  Quite  expensive for the combo… but it works great with make up or just as a tinted moisturizer with mascara. * This is a great product and feels good on my skin, but I can't use it like other moisture products before applying my foundation because of pilling.. I now use only at night so I'm not putting anything over it. * I like it. I also drink collagen supplements so i think it works pretty well on top if it. Im only 23 so i dont have wrinkles to begin with but i will say that its pretty sticky going on and if you touch your face while its trying to dry than you will get the 'beads' like everyone else is saying but if you dont touch your face until its fully dry it will look normal"

Mild and fragrance free. SPF 21 sun protection.
Sooths, moisturizes, and protects. 
Perfect for sensitive skin. 
The only problem is that it is rather pricey. 
A product like that in a tube that size, should not cost any more than $30. * My husband uses this product and has me order it again and again as it provides a good moisturizer to his face and keeps him safe in the sun!!! * Loooooved this SPF moisturizer, it worked perfectly on my face and did a great job protecting my skin from UV rays all day, but after finding out how potentially harmful oxybenzone can be I stopped using it & switched to a Cetaphil moisturizer instead. Wish they'd reformulate it so I could go back to using it again. * I personally wasn't a fan of this product. First I want to point out the sales associates at Ulta are super sexist to men and I got passed multiple times every time I asked for help literally ignored me. But back to this product, it's very similar to sun screen I prefer a thicker face lotion like the 2-1 face & beard but that got discontinued. * After years of using Vasaline Intensive Care lotion on his face, I convinced him to try the Clinique For Men Broad Spectrum SPF21 Moisturizer.  He loved it!  For a lotion with sun scree, it's not greasy and  it absorbs into the skin nicely leaving no residue. * If you've ever had a reaction to a sunscreen this one probably contains your culprit. Wore once and broke out in a rash/hives where it was applied. I will now be avoiding oxybenzone. * Applied it at the store to test it out and also bought some, a few hours later had a giant bump on my chin. Going to rerun it tomorrow."

It is slightly oily, but sometimes that's what you need. * If you use it alone its great, but while I was applying this to a client I realize it started pilling, so definitely do not use it underneath makeup, she said it felt great on her skin * I have extremely dry skin.  Most products are water based and my skin just absorbs it, leaving me dry. This lotion keeps my face and skin moisturized. * Be careful! I went to reorder this and noticed that they added mineral oil to the ingredients which is a known carcinogen! This is not listed in the current bottle i have. I loved the moisture this gave me but will not use again with this ingredient. * Holy grail moisturizer! Huge bottle that lasts for ever and i can use it on my body too!

I will always recommend using this product * I'm not sure why this happened if my skin is really good with salicylic acid in fact it prefers it then benzyl peroxide so I decided to try this out. I put it on overnight after my moisturizer as much as my pointer finger and I woke up the next day, my breakouts worse so I just stopped using it right then and there kind of disappointed was hoping for good results.🥺 * I love how it feels on my skin and i think it would add hydration to my skin. * My daughter tried the face wash and this gel and her face had a terrible reaction. No, no new foods or other items. She immediately began burning. Her face is like this on both sides and she has never had sensitive reaction to any other product. * I have dry, but clear skin. However, summertime + makeup = sweaty breakouts. So to stay on top of it, I started using this product once daily during my nighttime routine. Started working in just a few days of use. Now, instead of having several problem areas after a full day of wearing a full face of  makeup and sweating, I maybe have just small baby blemish that resolves itself overnight. It also does not dry out my skin more than it already is, if anything my skin has been feeling softer and more hydrated. I use La Roche Posay double repair moisturizer and it works well alongside it. With how well this has worked for me, I'm excited to try more products from them. Highly recommend! * i love this brand so much i've literally never been disappointed with any of their stuff but my makeup grips onto this like the hydro grip primer i am in love!! I've always had issues with layering and pilling no matter what i changed before but this product is crazy good and makes it easy, here to repurchase AGAIN. please good molecules never stop making this product and just try it especially if u have oily or combo skin"

195,peach slices,redness relief calming cream,pimprod2033305,2597521," * I personally love this one, but it's gone too soon because it's liquidy (i like the consistency though). I mix it with a bit of Cortisone and its a great moisturizer with redness calming effect. I wish I could afford to buy one every month. * I LOVE this stuff! I had acne and a horrible red rash all over my neck. Used this after my nightly shower, and woke up with an 80% reduction of redness. Used it again that morning, and the redness was gone by that night. I use it religiously to keep my neck hydrated and rash free. I highly recommend it! * A couple years ago my face started getting really red and patchy. I tried a few other moisturizers and none of them helped. I found out that my redness is caused by Post-Inflammatory Erythema so I started looking for products to calm inflammation and decided to give this a try and I'm so glad I did! I use the matching cleanser and I noticed relief right away. With continued use of the cleanser and this moisturizer, along with a few other products, my redness and inflammation have calmed down so much it's crazy. It's very lightweight and a little goes a long way! I like that it doesn't start to pill if I accidentally use too much and it's great under makeup. I don't even use a primer anymore, I just make sure this moisturizer has had enough time to settle into my skin before applying foundation. It can make your skin look a little greasy if you use too much or don't rub it in enough but I just use an oil absorbing sheet and gently pat my face to relieve that. Overall I'm very happy with this product line and will definitely keep coming back! * I basically got a chemical burn from a name brand ""for acne prone sensitive skin"" face wash. Then I had to try every moisturizer for sensitive acne prone skin to keep it from being so dry.
After one use, the dryness/redness is GONE this morning! It doesn't burn/sting. It's not greasy. ♥️ * I bought this product because I love their Snail Rescue Serum plus I struggle with redness in my cheek and nose area, especially in cold/dry weather. This product does little (if anything at all) for my redness and it's very greasy looking for daytime use. It's also a gel, not a cream, which I usually love but it didnt sink into my skin the way gels usually do. I ended up just using this as a nighttime barrier during winter and it was nice because it definitely has moisturizing properties, however, I would not purchase again because it doesn't do what it says it does plus it's pretty pricey for the amount you get. * This has been the only thing ive found to help with my hot flashes for my face! Calms it down fairly quick! * I was in need of a moisturizer and was drawn to this one because of its claims to reduce redness. My skin gets quite dry in the winter and unfortunately this was not enough to help it feel moisturized throughout the day. I needed to add extra hydrating serums with this moisturizer to keep my skin from feeling tight. It may be a good summer time moisturizer though! I also don't think it helps a lot with redness. I have persistent redness around my nose and cheeks and I didn't really notice a difference. It does give a nice glow after the initial application, but does not really lock in moisture."
196,vanicream,facial moisturizer broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2042402,2619672," * I would say this is an ""ok"" sunscreen for others but not for me. I have sensitive oily/acne-prone skin and I feel that this sunscreen is a little to greasy. It also kind of leaves a white cast but its only noticeable if you stare. * This is everything in one. It moisturizes without making me greasy or a weird color. And my favorite part is that it has spf 30 so it's perfect for everyday * I was on the quest to find a budget alternative to the Supergoop Mineral Sheerscreen I had been using for a while. I stumbled upon this, which is friendly for my sensitive skin in all the right ways and it even doubles as a moisturizer that includes 5 ceramides! Thus, I decided to give it a try, and I am so happy I did! This is even better than my previous sunscreen! It's cheaper, larger, less thick on my skin, more hydrating, better ingredients, does just as good underneath my makeup and it also doesn't leave as much of a white cast, but I rub it in good and don't usually notice a cast anyways with mineral sunscreens because I have pale skin. So please do yourself a favor if you have sensitive skin and don't mind a mineral sunscreen that's also a moisturizer and honestly a makeup primer for me as well :) By the way, I also have dry skin naturally so my skin drinks it, but this might be too thick for people with oily skin or combo. * I had to stop using chemical sunscreens because they would cause my eyes to water or sting. This is the first mineral sunscreen that doesn't pill on me. 

I have dry skin, and I think it feel wonderful, but I would imagine someone with lily skin not liking this product. 

I'm pretty fair, so white cast isn't something I worry about, but I imagine if you have darker skin you might need to spend some time getting this to rub in fully. 

I use this everyday on top of vit C, and have had some of the best skin of my life. I've used almost 2 tubes and am getting ready to buy a third. * A little goes a long way.  Blends in nicely.  Recommended on Yuka app for clean beauty. * Loved this on my skin! Doesn't irritate or clog pores. Sits well under my foundation and doesn't pill or leave white marks. * The formula is so dense it feels heavy on the skin. I know it's a mineral sunscreen but it leaves such a noticeable white cast. Don't even think about putting other products under because every single one I've tried has pilled off when I go to rub it in"

I use Hyra Zen twice a day - morning and when i get home from work i wash my face and apply it again. I also been keeping it in the fridge lately and love it. I have gotten many compliments. I facetimed my brother one day - he said sis you look good! He said your skin looks great, what are you using lol. I laughed, thanked him, told him I have no makeup on, then told him I use Lancome Hydra Zen Glow but I put it on like 10-12 hours ago, like at 5am when I was getting ready for work lol  When I finally got home I put all the Lancome products I have together, took a pic and sent it to him. * Ive been using this product for 6 months and the benefits have been amazing. I have a dark complexion and it does wonders on my wintery dry skin. I am about to purchase my second bottle!!!! * messed up my makeup every time I used it. had to trash all my makeup sponges * It feels great in my face * Too sticky and didn't get any benefit from this one. * A beautiful moisturizer for the Summer.  I have very dry and mature skin and generally need a very thick moisturizer so, thus one surprised me!  It's super light, absorbs very quickly and keeps my skin moisturized all night. * One of the best moisturizers ive used and ive used quite a few. I honestly it better then even the more expensive, better reviewed competitors (like Tatcha or Glow Recipe). The smell is strong but it works really well and makes my skin glow and feel good."

I've been using this for about 3 weeks and the wrinkles have diminished…I love this product. I haven't used Clinique in years and I decided to try it again after using a lot of the newer skin care lines. Thank goodness I decided to go back…CLINIQUE IS THE G.O.A.T. * I am older and thought this product would be great for me.

To my surprise, NO Green tint at All whatsoever and the color straight out of the tube is a orangey color thats not suitabel for fair skinned gals, also it dod cling to dry patches and pilled up some. Im Still on the Hunt for a product that can address my own skin concerns & for my skin tone also. Truly disappointing P&L!!!!!  
P.S. (I am a long-time fan of P&L lines and products, so w/this one, they really missed the marker) 
***It would NOT allow me to upload my pic of the product for reference either😠 * Im always looking for products that help with my rosacea and i love this brand so i thought i would try it out. Just like all the other reviews say, first time trying to use it literal liquid came out. It got literally everywhere, i will be returning it. * Definitely have to shake this product quite a bit because it separates but its so worth it. My skin is so even and hydrated without feeling sticky. I suffer from flushing/minor rosacea and I swear this keeps my face from overheating and the coverage is perfect looks like skin not too orange in my opinion. * mine came out all separated and smells weird, kind of off..tried some on my hand and when I eventually got the pigment and liquid to mix it was orange and cakey * The very first time I opened it, a huge jet of water came out. After thay I could not even shake it enough to get a usable product. Is not shelf stable ar all. * The product didn't even come out of the container; a watery substance cam out.

I use Olay sensitive during the winter months and usually add Neutrogena SPF, but I found this product this spring and decided to try it. I absolutely love. I use serum first and then this. I absorbs nicely and doesn't leave my skin sticky. I use under my eyes and my eye lids and I do not experience any burning. I occasionally use powder foundation and it holds all day. the scent is nice and not over powering like other products. * Wanted to love this product however it burns my eyes!! * Great product. * I can only put this on about half of my face because of how incredibly badly it makes my eyes sting. Even if I take care to avoid the eye area, it creeps in them somehow. Feels nice as a moisturizer but it makes me look more sweaty/oil slick than glowy. Have to completely cover my face with setting powder for my skin to not look wet."

On the side note, there is literally no difference between the before and after photo for wrinkle reduction…not sure what its trying to show LOL, I sure didn't see major changes on my skin. * the product is very hydrating and great for the winter. downside is that it leaks a little bit. * My first time ever trying this moisturizer and I use it before putting on my makeup and I definitely see a big difference in my complexion and overall look of my skin! Absolutely love and the travel size is perfect for me! * I was looking for a product that would give me thick and creamy and this one does just that! Need to use a very little amount to get the job done! Not greater clogging at all! * 👍👌 * I absolutely love this cream! It's kinda pricey especially for such a small container but overall it works great :) * This product is not magic. It's an OK moisturizer. Doesn't really have any pleasant or offensive smell. May have made my face slightly softer, I didn't notice any improvement and wrinkles. My main issue is the cost and also the travel sized container would require you to bring Q-tips or an applicator with you. You can't fit even a finger into the tiny opening to get the product out. Will use what I have, but wouldn't buy again."

I trusted them as an early brand for clean beauty, when that category was much (much) smaller. While this product smelled amazing, and soaked in great...I started breaking out. I couldn't figure it out for a week!

Not only are octyl salicylate and octocrylene not reef safe, but they also break me out terribly with what feels more like a burn. Stay away, if not for yourself - for the environment. * I was very excited to find a daily moisturizer with the bonus of having sun protection. However, I don't want to smell like I'm going to the beach at work (or anywhere else for that matter). It's kinda heavy and makes your eyes water from burning. * I absolutely love this moisturizer!! It is a bit greasy but if u have dry skin this is my go to. I love the subtle smell too! I would recommend this. Just don't get it near your eyes if possible. It will burn ur eyes * it's a bit greasy even after soaking into my normal skin, and has been causing me to break out. It smells amazing and feels nice, but I really miss the Sea &C magnifying primer that was discontinued. The finish was better and didn't make me break out at all. * I don't know why I thought that maybe this time regular American chemical sunscreen actives wouldn't burn the crap out of my face. This product irritated my skin really bad. I bought the whole line and had such bad breakouts and dry skin that it took at least two months to regain even a semblance of normal skin and I only used the line for at best two weeks (but the sunscreen was only once on the face). I was using this on my chest as sunscreen until I started breaking out there too. I have had a bad reaction to nearly all of Pacifica's products and I think I'm done even trying. * The moisturizer works great and smells amazing. However, it's not the best for oily skin. I have combination oil skin and my skin gets very, very oily with this after a few hours. I gave it 4 stars just for that reason. If you have normal or dry skin, I think this would work better."

Fragrance is subtle. Only need a little, absorbs quickly but keeps my face hydrated all day. Doesnt clog my pores or cause breakouts. Layers well under my sunscreen and makeup. There is a version with spf but its not enough, and it feels heavy. I prefer this version, and layer my spf50 over this. Also love that its refillable. * Leaves my face feeling hydrated and plumped and smooth * I rarely get irritated skin from a skincare product, but this cream irritated my face so badly. After applying in the morning, by nighttime, my skin was red, itchy, and breaking out. Over the next few days. my face was super dry and peeling. Not sure which ingredient was the cause but this cream was disappointing, had to return. * This product make my skin soft and smooth, only little bit is enough for the skin * Really love how this isnt greasy or sticky. The scent is nice. My makeup looked so good over it w a primer, but I'd prefer it had a sunBLOCK. SPF 40, at least. I feel naked w/out more sun protection. Otherwise, loved it."
207,avÃ¨ne,tolerance control skin recovery balm,pimprod2026570,2586856," * I tried this product for 2 weeks and I now have dry flaky skin on my cheeks and nose. I bought this product because I have sensitive skin that gets a little drier in the winter months, but my skin has never been this dry in my life! 
Pros: it dries quickly and applys nice under makeup. Not greasy. 
Cons: dried up my skin into a flaky mess. * Since I have hypothyroidism, my skin was always super dry and I would have a lot of rashes as a result. But, this lotion is sensitive enough not to irritate my skin furthermore and durable enough to lock in moisture to eliminate dryness without clogging up my pores. Happy i came across this brand because I have wasted a lot of money before finding this product. * Please never remove this. It's the only moisturizer I've ever been able to use without triggering my acne!! I never have any product related breakouts anymore!! Finding a good moisturizer that worked for my skin was soo hard. This is so perfect and I've been using it for probably a year now. * I use retinol and aha products regularly so every now and then my skin peels and gets red and sensitive. I have tried a lot of soothing and calming products on the market to fix my occasionally irritated skin but so far this one is the only one that doesn't hurt when applied and that actually calms my skin down. I have used both its cream and balm version. They are both great but I like the balm one a little better. * Glides onto the skin nicely and leaves a nice hydrated finish to the skin. Very soothing for dryness without clogging pores * In recent years i've developed excema on my eyelids, chin & ear lobes. I've tried so many moisturizers that claim to help reduce redness and lock in moisture, but it wasn't until I found this product that my skin changed for the better. I bought the 3 pack sample with the facewash and thermal water and fell in love with all. 

First purchased back in September 2022 & still using the same 3 products today. I even tried to change back to some old products that used to work for me and my skin returned to the brittle and scaly old self that used to be. I remain consistent with this brand, and they have shown me love back, my skin soaks this stuff in and doesnt break me out whatsoever. 

Super gentle and refreshing. One of my favorite pros is that it leaves my irritated and stinging skin, smooth and calm. if you have irritated skin that stings, even when you put your moisturizer on it, this product is definitely for you and will help with that sensation. * This is my favorite Avene product! So much that I finished my first tube and bought two more! It has been very helpful for my dry face this winter and I love using it at night over my serums."

A little goes a long way and my face looks and feels hydrated. * The smell is natural and calming. The feel is natural and clean * Literally spanks for the face !!! Tighten plump and hydrated silky skin! I also use on my neck and chest. Staple in my routine now ! * I have tried many moisterizers and overnight moisturizers and THIS one is beat smelling best smoothing lifting brightening and cost efficient product with no bad reactions on my skin! No burn just smooth texture all day. I love this because most give me hwasaches the second i out them on becausebof fragrance but this smells sooo good without any pain to my eyes or head! I can't recommend enough, will be repurchasing! I bought when it was on thanksgiving sale! * PUR's Get A Lift moisturizer has become a staple in my beauty routine! I've been using it for a year and have purchased it three times now. I've only ever bought it when it's on sale, but I honestly think even at full price it would be worth it! I'm 34 with combo skin, leaning more towards oily. My skin is also flaking and peeling right now due to my prescription skincare treatment and the cold weather. This moisturizer does an excellent job keeping my skin hydrated without pilling or weighing it down, and it keeps the peeling down to a minimum, if any! Once it's absorbed, my skin looks nice and dewy instead of greasy, and I've seen improvement in both softness and texture of my skin. It does burn occasionally if I have patches that are particularly red/irritated, but the burning stops quickly and there's no irritation afterwards. The scent is light, sort of citrusy, and it doesn't linger. I use it every evening and one jar lasts me about 4-5 months. Overall I highly recommend this moisturizer! * This facial cream feels great on my skin. I use it daily to help with loss of elasticity and firmness, especially around the jawline. I really do think it's helped my 60+  yr. old skin. * This moisturizer feels amazing on my skin and so luxurious. I would buy again!"

As another review mentioned it seems to pill. * Made my foundation peel right off. The primer itself feels nice ans hydating but would not recommend putting makeup on top. * I use this product every day with or without makeup, it feels so nice on my skin and keeps it hydrated and gives it a nice glow. * Had such high hopes due to multiple influencers recommending this product. Didn't notice much difference in the appearance of my combo, dehydrated skin. Worst of all id the fact that this product PILLS and doesn't play nice with much of any other skincare products nor makeup. Really wanted this to work! * I used this religiously from the ages of 15-17 and it was my favorite makeup product. I reordered it on sale last week at the age of 25 and it is still so amazing, but not hydrating enough for me anymore. I love the smell, its super light but lingers in the best way. I will still use it and probably reorder but will be prepping with a heavier moisturizer before applying this under makeup. I also really love it for a no makeup makeup day because it just seems to make my skin even and glowy. * I just turned 44 and am feeling it. I purchased a bag of new products including this moisturizer on the recommendation of 2 employees. I wore it for the first time on Thursday with mascara and eyeshadow. A female coworker told me, ""I hope that this doesn't get me into trouble, but your face looks so good. You have the natural glow of someone that just had a good time."" So needless to say I will wear this every day for the rest of my life. * My skin isn't the most sensitive, but it does have random triggers that cause redness and irritation.

I've already noticed changes and will continue to use Tula! * I love this moisturizer. I have sensitive skin that becomes dry and dull in the winter. The moisturizer does not irritate my skin and keeps my skin moisturized all day long. It smells great too! * 1.7 oz of product which will last you barely a month. for the price it is not worth it. * The product is okay, but not worth the cost.

I would recommend it 👍🏼 * I have always had problems with my skin, i have dry patches around my nose and mouth constantly but recently my forehead has had pealing skin and it has been so dry and anything I have used in the past has either burned or made it worse. I saw this and I gave it a try, I use this after I wash with the oil cleanser of the same line and i do use a lot of the moisturizer but it doesn't irritate or burn my skin, it has stopped the patches and pealing skin. It has also made my skin look more glowy and a lot softer. 10/10 recommended for very sensitive skin (I do have dermatitis also) * This worked incredibly well on my  eczema.  It helped with the dryness and itching.  This is the second tube I purchase and since it was on sale, I stocked up. * ive been dealing with the worst skin issues for almost a year and this is the first product ive used where I actually see RESULTS with my redness and flaking slowly going away. My skin is going back to feeling soft and i could cry of happiness im so happy i found this!! * I purchased and used the whole bottle, and even though I loved it I decided to try other brands. And after  using other eczema creams I will come back to this and repurchase the product. It absorbs well and fast, and it doesn't feel heavy. It feels smooth and it is very hydrating for those lingering super dry eczema spots. * My face suddenly became red and began burning and peeling.  I used this cream and it cleared up overnight!  I now use it every night and morning.  Like a miracle! * I have recently been dealing with dry patches on my face, especially around my nose, eyebrows snd chin. It was causing my face to feel extremely greasy, yet dry at the same time. When i would shower there would always be an insane amount of dead skin, and after using my regular products in my skincare routine my face was not feeling hydrated at all. I picked this up after doing some research and after one use my skin feels plump and hydrated! I have extremely fair and sensitive skin with alot of redness on my face and this product did not itritate my skin in the slightest. I applied after using La Roche Posay's gentle face wash for normal to oily skin and the difference I feel after this combo is insane.

Could be a good fit for someone without dryness. * Beware that this product might burn your skin. I used it as recommended and it left bright red marks on my neck and face. * This might be fine in the summer but definitely not moisturizing enough for me in fall/winter. I find my skin is oily and tight half way through the day. It is cooling on the skin and decent under a tinted moisturizer. * This product has helped my oiliness slightly, and did not irritate the sensitive areas on my face, and doesn't burn when applying. It soaks in quickly, and my skin feels refreshed afterward. I don't see why I wouldn't continue to use this product. There is no scent, which I appreciate. * I liked. * I have had trouble finding a good go-to lotion thats not greasy, and this is amazing. I use it everyday AM and PM, and it leaves my face feeling so smooth and clean without the feeling of a heavy moisturizer. I would compare this to the belif aqua bomb, just even more lightweight. * I have sensitive skin so I was scared to try a new moisturizer.

Bad bad breakout followed. I will be putting this right in the trash where it belongs since I never want to make that mistake again. Overpriced for something that harmed my skin. * I bought this one and took it back the next day. Like, it's ok but i used it and it left a bad white cast behind that would not rub in. I took mine back and got the one without the suncreen and its great. Its the same exact thing - just without the suncreen. * I love everything from First Aid Beauty & had high hopes for this.  Very disappointing!  It's thick, doesn't absorb into your skin, just sits on top.  It also pills terribly-even hours later! * I love this brand but this product is awful:( I found the moisturizer pretty thick and ended up having to use a decent amount to even cover my face. With the larger amount I was using I didn't find it very hydrating and my face felt tight. It also left a white cast and was a little streaky. The absolute deal breaker was the burning in my eyes. I cannot open my eyes at all with how bad it is. Even after washing my face the burning sensation won't go away. A waste of money and a lot of tears. * I love the original Ultra Repair Moisturizer so I bought this one hoping it would be the same. I found it  hard to rub into my skin. It felt like it just sat on top of my skin. It also burned my eyes. Even when I'm careful not to get it anywhere near my eyes I end up tearing up pretty bad. * This burned my eyes horribly. * Feels amazing"

Super happy i found thid snd will pribably be using this forever! * I would use this even if it didn't contain Vitamin C because it is so moisturizing; it is like a layer of protective cushion for your skin. The fact it contains the stable form of Vitamin C that most dermatologists prefer to recommend is of course THE reason to use it. I also LOVE that they didn't add fragrance to mask the  normal smell of the vitamin C ingredient. Yes, that odd ""hot dog?"" scent is just what the vitamin C smells like, and it dissipates in less than a minute. * Bought this product about a month ago, I was worried at first about spending so much money, but it was time to drop the dime. I'll be turning 35 soon and my skin was dull, dry and sometimes had red patches that would burn when using other creams, correctors and moisturizers.

It left a silicon film on my skin that never sank in. I also think it was irritating my skin due to the layer on top. I don't know who this would work for. Not enough moisture for dry skin and a greasy film that wouldn't go with oily skin. * ""I really love this product for what it offers. Some reviews mention that it doesn't fully absorb into the skin and just sits on the surface, but I'm not sure it's meant to absorb completely. What matters to me is the dewy glow it gives, which I absolutely love. One tip: make sure to keep your hair pulled back when applying, as the residue can leave your hair feeling oily. Overall, I'm a big fan of this product. I started with the travel size, and now I've splurged on the full size. I'll definitely repurchase! * I would have give it a 5 if it were based on how well this product hydrates your face. However, after applying the product to your face it gives off this oily texture and just throws the product all the way off. You would need to sctually wash your hands to get that oily feel from ur hands. Nonetheless, ok moisturizer. * It leaves a coating on your face, it does not seem to actually sink into the skin, rather make it look wet/greasy. I'm disappointed as I'm looking for something that gives a lot of moisture. * Skincare is something I'm extremely passionate about and this is the best moisturizer I have ever used! I have never used a moisturizer so thick yet not greasy, moisturizing but doesn't remain ""wet"" on the skin. It absorbs beautifully and provide the perfect balance. It's absolute magic! * So I have extremely dry skin, my whole face gets flaky like lizard skin and leaves little white flecks all over my face (like face dandruff!). I have found that First Aid ultra repair cream has definitely stopped the flaking and dryness which is great! However, after receiving a free sample of this on my birthday I have found that I definitely like this so much better.

This not only relieves that dryness but also somehow leaves my face looking plump and fresh with a nice dewy glow. I mean it really leaves my skin looking incredible all day.

A little goes a long way, meaning IT CAN BE VERY EASY TO USE TOO  MUCH! Using too much of this definitely will leave your skin feeling heavy and greasy and looking greasy too, not great. Definitely be careful with that but overall that's the only downside I've found to this moisturizer. * I was given a sample size of this and loved the results so much that I bought the full size product 3 days later! The feeling on your skin is like you're rubbing in water."

I love this. Put in in your PR * This is my new favorote SPF for my face. It absorbs quickly into the skin, does a great job protecting my skin from the sun, and smells divine. I have even worn it under makeup without any issues. * Great face lotion with spf. Lotion with spf that does not have a white cast on the skin. I love it and gives a great glow to the face * I received this sunscreen after attending their promotional walk for the launch of the product. I noticed the very next day I started getting micro bumps that resembled milia or granulomatous. I stopped wearing make up and switched to a gentle cleanser to see if those were the reasons however I remained applying the sunscreen to obviously help protect my face. To my surprise, my skin was only getting worse. It was starting to burn and itch. I've been allergy tested, and I don't have any. The day I didn't use the sunscreen, my skin condition immediately disappeared, so I went to look at the ingredients list. I don't know if Origins is using the oils from grapefruit, lemon and orange for fragrance purposes, but it does not list anywhere that they have extracted the furanocoumarins. After meeting with my dermatologist, I was advised that the citrus oils used in the sunscreen caused photosensitivity, and burned/ irritated my skin. If you are someone with darker or sensitive skin, I HIGHLY recommend AVOIDING this."

Started using this product again this week remembered why I love this! My face is becoming rehydrated again. The brightness is coming back and my rosacea is subsiding. I do have sensitive skin and this seems to do the trick to balance pH levels. If you have tried other products with no luck, try this product. Not every product fits everyone but this one is definitely worth the try. To me... worth every cent🙏 * 'My daughter is 14 and this product has been great for her acne * I love to try new products so I've experimented with a number of daily moisturizers with SPF like Drunk Elephant and Unseen Sunscreen and always come back to this Murad holy grail. It doesn't leave a white cast, is moisturizing, non-greasy, and doesn't pill under my makeup. I use this daily and a bottle lasts me roughly 4 months. I'm honestly shocked at other reviews saying they broke out as I have acne prone skin and never have but YMMV. * This is a decent sunscreen, rubs in fine and makes my skin soft. However this burns my eyes soooo bad. Obviously I know to not get sunscreen in my eyes, but it doesn't matter how carefully I put it on, my eyes burn. I have very sensitive & dry eyes and it just doesn't work. The Tula one in the yellow bottle, is the one I continue to go back too. * I was very excited to try this but was disappointed to find the results being similar to a drug store brand product not to mention this product caused my skin to break out and become oily. Never had those issues with my skin before starting to use this. Also the product just pours out of the bottle causing you to end up wasting product every time you use it which makes you run out a lot faster than you would expect. * I have heard great things about Murad so I finally decided to treat myself to this moisturizer. I wanted to love it SO bad but my skin has BLOWN UP with acne so bad, it's starting to really get to me. I used to struggle with acne but it had gotten to be almost non-existed until I bought this. At first I thought my pregnancy hormones had caused my flare up, and it could be a contributor, but this is really the only new piece of my skincare regimen and it seems like others have had the same bad experience as me too. Will be throwing it away and buying my old moisturizer. * As always, every experience can be different but I'll tell you mine: I have very sensitive skin , dry to normal, rarely have acne besides the occasional pimple. When I started using this, my face broke out like a crunch bar. TONS of bumps and several pimples. I started a new night cream at the same time so I wasn't sure, but as soon as I stopped using this my face cleared. It was pretty instant, at the end of the day the bumps were the worst and I would wash my face and wake up to no bumps (not what happens with typical acne). If you haven't heard of acne cosmetica, google it that way you can watch out for it with this product or any others. After looking closer I realized THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS SOME COMEDOGENIC INGREDIENTS (i.e. ethylhexyl palmitate)"

The serum has sadly been terribe. It evaporates almost before you can rub it in and after 3 days of usage steated to make my skin peel and flake and I do not have sensitive skin. I will be returning this product and would highly recommend you do not spend any money on it! * gives my skin a healthy glow. no irritation and I'm sensitive. * Im 26 yrs old nursing school, full time job and full time mommy to a toddler, i looked older and tired all the time no matter how much make up i would put on. Im on day 2 and WOW my skin looks soooooo smooth and clear!! I noticed it got rid of my acne too!! 🥹 Love love it! Worth every peny! I used to buy the sunday riley luna sleeping night oil double the cost of this and have not seen this much improvement in such a short term like this!! * After a few days i noticed a cluster of bumps on my neck and chest area. I figured it was from something else like perfume, but then I noticed smaller bumps on my face. I don't consider my skin sensitive so i am surprised. I wish this worked out. * After having my baby, part of my postpartum recovery included extremely dry skin around my chin and T-zone area. It was SOOOOOO bad. My makeup application was the worst showing patchy skin. I tried so many things to help, including high-end luxurious products, but nothing worked until I tried this for weeks. I saw it changed the texture of my skin that included smoother and moisturized skin. I love it so much, I just bought a second one. The scent is also light. Nothing too crazy. This was good to my sensitive skin. Highly recommend!!!! * This product did make my skin feel feel and look amazing.  However, it also caused acne breakouts that I hadn't experienced in many years.  For that reason, I can't use this product.  I wasn't prone to breakouts so it was a bit surprising. * Smooth and penetrates well. Skin feels soft and smooth"

I did give it a couple of more tries but the same thing happened. Not for sensitive facial skin. * It's not oily and doesn't leave your skin looking shiny instead a healthy glow. * Someone like myself with dry skin, this is a wonderful step for skin care. After i wash my face and dry/damp, I then use the water cream and let that sink into the skin. its very light weight and feels really smooth on the skin. 
It wont be a single step hydrate cream but it really does help! I like to put on a moisturizing lotion after it sets and my skin has never felt better! * I have normal to dry skin and this doesn't do the job. Maybe it is just for oily skin. Even when I use HA and/or oil serum. Feels like it barely does anything after I apply it. But it doesn't clog pores which is nice. I will save it for summer when it is more humid, but I'll have to find another moisturizer to get through winter. * this is SUCH a great moistuizer and SUCH a good price for as much as you get as well as the skin benefits too.

I have dry skin with dry patches and while this doesnt get rid of the patches it definitely relieves them the most compared to other products. Better than drunk elephant and better than cerave. The only con is it is soooo expensive. It it honestly worth it to me * I received this product for free and I loved this product so much! It was so lightweight and hydrating, also leaving me with a total glow! Would highly recommend this product if your looking for a lightweight moisturizer. * This is the absolute best moisturizer and provides a beautiful glow. The 1.7 oz jar last me 3-4 months and leaves my skin supple. * This review is 100% honest & true: 
I'm 43, menopause. My skin is desperately dry, withered, wrinkled, lost density, and now acneic. 😫
This cream is sensational. I live in arid dry cold Colorado and this cream is very viscous - like elmers glue! It remains on the skin hours later, sealing in plumping moisture, but NOT occlusive. Great ingredients list, zero fragrance, and wears well under tinted SPF. High shine though - so I use a setting powder over it in some places. Not causing break outs, and lessens the appearance of fine lines. * Glass packaging that in my opinion preserves the product better with excellent ingredients and a texture of a fine cream that absorbs completely into the skin without leaving it oily and contains a soft scent. * I love it let my face rest moisturizer * This is rhe perfect not to heavy moisture but not to light! I gave this to my 3 year old and she absolutely loves it! I bought it a week ago and she alresh needs a new one! But im not even mad because it is so amazing! Eveeyone needs to buy this it is so good!"

Goes on light, a little goes a long way I'd say, I have combination skin that used to be really oily but now is rather dry, I'd say it's fine for all skin types personally. Also it comes out by pressing down on it, whenever it runs low you can twist to get the rest of it. I was stressing out trying to get it out before realizing it opens. Again, would buy this all the time if not for the pricing, but pretty worth it * I've purchased this two times now and am loving how light it feels on the skin while being super hydrating for my dry skin. The container pump makes it so easy to apply. * I got this and the eye cream, both burned my eyes and skin. I am sensitive but don't usually break out in a few hours from a product. Also were very sticky long after applying just them and no other products for self testing. * Far from a moisturizer but in fact left my skin super oily. * Hands down the best makeup primer EVER. Its too good. My makeup looks freshly applied all day long. I csnt say enough about it. * I spent alot on this and it did nothing for me. I like how the product is provided. The moisturizer itself caused skin irritation after I used appropriate face cleanser foe skin type. Not for eczema prone or sensitive skin! * The formula is fine—nothing amazing—and there are similar moisturizers at a more affordable pricepoint. I have combo sensitive skin and it didn't irritate my skin. I do really like it when i mix it with my retinol oil at night as it helps dry down the oil faster and keep in the moisture. The packaging is my favorite part with the pump top. When i'm out of this, i'll refill it with my cetaphil night cream. I got it when it was half off but i still think it's too expensive for what it is."

I think it lives up to it's claim: my face appears to be smoother, feels softer. * Bummer that this is now 5 mL smaller than before but costs exactly the same. * Not great for sensitive skin. I love a milky SPF for layering other products but even with a heavy moisturizer underneath it dried my skin and caused peeling and flaking * I go through sunscreen like its nothing because I tend to burn easily. This one is lightweight and comfortable. I wear it under makeup without any problems like some cause. The only downside is the price for the size youre getting, but otherwise I love this product and will be buying it again. * I love the texture and feel of this sunscreen and it doesn't cause acne for my very sensitive skin. Downside is it goes quickly and the price point is too high. * I have sensitive, dry skin. I'm newer to using sunscreen daily. I researched many brands and this had great reviews, so I bought it hoping for the best. Using it over my serums has helped them work their magic. My dark spots have eased up and my expression lines are less prominent. My skin is more hydrated and plump. I plan to keep using this because ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" and it works perfectly for me! Also, sometimes when I introduce a new product, my skin has a bad reaction (redness, irritation, breakout) and this sunscreen has not caused any negative reactions."

Love it * My skin feels smooth and moistureized. * This is my night cream ever night.  It works, It does not irritate my skin. What's not to love about that? * I received a sample of this and did wear sunscreen during the day. The first night it went on everything seemed fine. It went on with no problem. The second day I felt a little tight itching? By the third day I started seeing peeling around my nose and my face felt itchy and burny. Not an overwhelming itch but enough to recognize I'm having a bad reaction. Peeling, itching and a slight burning sensation. I didn't use makeup the first two days but when I put makeup on the third day, it went on blotchy and I could see the irritation on my cheeks, mostly below my eye area. I'm Pacific Islander, NC30 and in my 40's, sadly this product is not for me. * Product is usually good. But got a bad batch and felt bad so I didn't bring it back.

It's nongreasy, unscented formula glides onto the skin smoothly. It's lightweight and is great for morning and night use. I like it so much that I went back to buy more ""good light"" products! * My new go to moisturizer! I have sensitive combo skin and my skin just loves the hydration this leaves all day. My skin feels so soft and healthy after using it. Nice enough in the summer alone but even better for the fall/winter in the midwest over their abc oil. Fragrance free too. * I really like this face cream for the winter. I live in a high desert climate and have combination skin; this isn't great for all year long but in the winter it's perfect especially after a day outside in harsh conditions. Definitely not lightweight and would be too heavy/ oily for someone with oily skin or in a humid climate but it's great when I need it! As a bonus, I love the packaging. It's not my holy grail and it's more expensive for the size than some other creams that do essentially the same thing but it does it's job well! * Im very picky on what i use on my skin, and this is my holy grail!! I just purchased my 4th bottle today. Its thick and will last all night keeping you moisturized. Its light scented as well! The bottle isnt super huge and its a bit pricey but definitely worth it! * This moisturizer is nothing short of amazing! Perfect! I've tried them all. This is rich, thick, and best of all..no scent!

The product is heavier than most but I feel it does a great job of hydrating my skin. The biggest con I have is the blue painted lid on the jar peels and leaves blue fragments of paint in the product, thus it going on my face.

It's become a staple in my skincare routine, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a simple, effective moisturizer. * This is a very hydrating moisturizer!

I agree with others it's a little tacky feeling but subsides fairly quick. That being said I give it 4 stars. My skin after a few days is more hydrated and healthier looking. * As someone who is always looking for the absolute most lightweight possible lotion, this is a great option for keeping winterttime dryness away without feeling weighted down.

I picked this while trying to find noncomedogenic moisturizers with clean ingredients according to Yuka, but my mom helped point out to me later this has vegetable oil in it… Cool! 🙃 * its just perfect and a little goes a long way * I dont really know what people are saying about this product, most people are saying its lightweight and non greasy but it feels so heavy, sticky, and greasy on my face, maybe just not for me but I won't be buying this again * I have sensitive skin and this works well for me. Love that it isnt too heavy on my combo/acne prone skin * I was hoping this product would work well on my acne-prone skin, but it doesn't seem to do much for me. It doesn't absorb very well into the skin so the more you use the more ends up sitting on your face. The claims about this moisturizer being pre-biotic don't seem to mean much.

I look 15 years older. Literally does the opposite of what it's suppose to. Now I'm just praying these new wrinkles fade. * It's just temporary, so keep that in mind. * These are not very strong and theyre small. If you havent tried ""frownies"" i suggest trying those. Theyre cheaper for a larger quantity and better results. * I tried these on a few spots on my face, under eyes, smile lines, and 11 lines on forehead. I honestly wouldnt bother using these under your eyes because the adhesive is so strong it pulls at your skin even with wetting them. They did work well on my smile lines and 11 lines but they just soften the wrinkles, my results only lasted about 1 week. Personally I'd invest in a good quality eye cream over using these patches. * I love this idea and if it worked it would be cool but they don't stay on - followed directions to a ""t"" and still fell off within the hour.

Bought 3 times before yall went and raised the price by $14. Not worth the price IMO. I feel there are better products for that price point. * I got this to keep my face from getting dry this winter. It works very well so far. The only thing I question is the fragrance, which is delightful, but probably not so good for my skin. * I wanted to love this product! The smell/texture is lovely.

Unfortunately, while sporting a ""clean ingredients"" tag and a tag from the national eczema association, I found the product to be highly irritating when I had a flare up. I only used it once during that time, and then after taking a second look at the ingredients, I found out that ""phenoxyethanol"" is a known potential allergen, irritant, potential endocrine disruptor, and the manufacturing process is highly polluting. In other countries the ""safe"" threshold for this ingredient is 1%, but it's hard to determine how much one is exposed to if applying daily/multiple times a day. Of course, there is no such regulation in US, so who knows how much is in this cream. 

At the same time I bought this, I tried products from cocokind which I highly recommend! They have a great price point and really are ""clean"" from what I have used so far, although one should always do their own research. While I was still having an eczema episode, I found using a homemade oatmeal paste + cocokind's chia seed oil was very helpful to get me through the dry itchiness. 

TLDR: not a clean product, could be irritating, check out cocokind. * I've been being treated for cancer for about a year and a half, now. Almost 6 months of that has been chemotherapy. Most products cause acne and rashes on my skin, since being on treatment. 
Pros: Did not irritate my overly sensitive skin. Smells good. I don't understand all the complaints about the smell. It is light and nice. It is kind of like marshmallows, but better. 

Cons: it moisturizes, but not enough while going through chemo. It feels great when I first put it on. But, after a few hours my skin feels tight again. Kind of like how vaseline can trick you into thinking your skin is moisturized at first. Hours later the surface of your skin feels tight and dry like a sunburn ready to peel. 

For the price, thete are much better options. Philosophy moisturizers are a lottle cheaper and give better longer lasting results for me in terms of moisture. * This is my 3rd time repurchasing this moisturizer. Unreal/ must try! * I do not want my face smelling like vanilla frosting but it did the whole time I used this. My fault but I'd literally have to hold my breath * Earlier this year my dermatologist informed me I have seborrheic dermatitis. I've been using ketoconazole shampoo which definitely helps but I still found myself needing to use cortisone cream on my face (gross!!). So I was researching moisturizers good for dermatitis and while Supermello isn't specifically marketed for dermatitis (it does list eczema) I thought it sounded like it may help. I am SO GLAD I gave it a chance!!!!! its been about 2 weeks now and my face is looking the best it's looked in several years. Patches that I thought were stubborn acne have been clearing up and are almost totally gone. the hydration level us just right so I feel moisturizes but don't get greasy as the day goes on. It does smell REALLY lovely with the light vanilla/Marshmallow aroma. Definitely worth trying if you have skin conditions that make you red/itchy!"
254,osea,seabiotic water cream,pimprod2027013,2587124," * Osea's website markets this as being for all skin types, so I tried it. I always thought I was oily/combo skin and wanted a less greasy look so I went for this.

Turns out, either my skin may have been the dry type (this product dried it). Its hard to say. It wasnt very moisturizing and I'd say more dehydrating, as my forehead developed dehydration lines and skin overall looked dull/aged. 

Id been using a different product brand religiously for years before switching and never had any dullness, no dry skin, always bright and wrinkle free, hydrated and clear. Ultimately switched back. * Osea is my favorite skincsre brand! This is literally the  only product ive tried i'm not in love with. It is hydrating yes, but it feels heavy on my skin and takes a while to absorb. While i dont hate it, i like my moisturizer to feel light and refreshing, so i wont be getting this again * This cream feels nice on the skin at first and has no discernable fragrance. Over time it started to sting my skin, caused the worst break out I've ever had and made my skin red and puffy. I have no allergies. * It's a gear product, I just wish it came in a 2.0 Ounce pump bottle like the atmosphere protection cream! * This is a lovely cream, it feels light on my skin. I use it at night. My skin feel soft and hydrated in the morning. I especially love that it is cruelty free. * This is my go to day moisturizer. Keeps my skin hydrated all day without being greasy! * I've used this moisturizer multiple times. It's a great Summer moisturizer, light and refreshing. Lasts about 2 months."

This moisturizer is the first perfect combo of moisturizer and SPF I have found without it making my T zone worse or my chin flaky! Def buying another tube! * I have and oily T section and my skin becomes especially red or dry around my cheeks and chin right before my period. I've tried a lot of SPF and finally found one that doesn't leave me ultra shiny and oily.  I really like this product and will keep using it! Only downside is that I think some of the oils in the product settled and the last couple of uses did leave my skin somewhat shiny but other than that, my skin was left soft and even toned! * Contains harmful chemicals that damage our coral reefs. Please make smart consumer choices, this sunscreen is not environmentally safe and my face broke out when using it :( * this sunscreen gave me such a healthy glove, and my skin did not feel oily or greasy at!!!! I used to have the Laroche poosay (I hope i spelled it right) sunscreen, and it would make my skin shiny, but it all oily. I have normal skin and I really love this product. * I'm in my 30's and have always had acne prone, oily skin. A few years ago, I was able to clear up my skin with a strict morning and night routine that includes prescription creams, but every time I would try using SPF, I would immediately break out. I've tried dozens of prestige and drugstore brands! This moisturizer with SPF is the first that hasnt caused a single breakout. I've been using it for over a month now and I will continue to as long as its on shelves. * This product is okay as a moisturizer and sunscreen but leaves you shiny looking. It also does not work well under makeup at all. I learned the hard way after I was almost completely done with my makeup and it began lifting and leaving ugly peeling patches when i used a powder brush. For the price, theres way better sunscreens out there. The murad sunscreen in a blue bottle is about the same size and the same price but works amazing. * I switched to this sunscreen and my pores and oily skin were controlled also my skin felt amazing! I could t rebuy it because I was pregnant but whenever I get my hands on this again I would gladly stick to this only. The only con is the size and price"

I would DEFO recommend and I am looking forward to re-purchase. * Broke my skin out badly right away. * Love this product!! * A little goes a long way. It's so wonderful feeling. You have to experience this to believe it. My skin has become so soft and younger looking. I will definitely keep this in my beauty routine * I mean it...when I say I am nearly 30 and struggled with hormonal skin since I was 12..I have spent SO much money on skincare products, it's insane. Recently I bought a $150 moisturizer claiming it was magic, when THIS..PUR Cloud Cream (for a fraction of the price)..was all I've ever wanted and needed. It is the silkiest product and it just melts into the skin like a drink for your pores. I mix it with a dab of Charlotte Tilbury ""beautiful skin"" foundation and I feel like a million bucks. Immediate confidence boost. It's just enough tint to perfect the redness from my acne and scars...and it leaves the most gorgeous finish, like I just got back from the medspa and my skin is plump, hydrated, and GLOWING. I got this as a sample from Ulta and I had to come back here, buy the full size immediately, and leave a review. I knew nothing about it so when I searched it up I was expecting this to be much more expensive. A double win for it's attainable price!! Please never discontinue. * I am allergic to tocopherol acetate, and this is the only moisturizer I can find at Ulta without it. Thank goodness it works well. Feels nice, not greasy. Absorbs quickly, and isnt strong smelling. * This is one of the only things I can use on my face! I dont have to worry about my face sweating when
I wear it. It is lightweight and is scent free!"

Great product! * Truly oil free. I have oily skin so I can immediately pick up on oily products. Very light weight and good texture. Best I've used so far. * Great product * I had started using the Bareminerals Skin Longevity line but didn't quite care for the daily moisturizer with sunscreen so I bought this product.  I am 60 yoa and have struggled with acne and skin problems since I was a teenager.  I believe it's mostly due to bad genes because my sisters and daughter also had acne problems. This moisturizer absorbs well, but because it is oil free, it doesn't leave my skin shiny or greasy looking. It makes my skin feel fresh and smooth. I do not look my age and I believe that using these Baremineral products contribute to my better looking skin. * I use this daily after cleansing. It is light-weight but easily covers my face & neck. It isn't oily at all. I have used other products in the past. They cause breakouts and leave my face feeling greasy all day or soak in immediately & don't create a good foundation. * Best moisture I have ever used. A little goes a long ways.  My skin has never felt or looked this good. Absolutely love this product.  Please don't ever stop selling this."

I noticed how smooth, how easy to smile it was, and what a big difference it was from the previous years. Using the whole set it's very expensive but if you are careful and use them as indicated they last.  I bought mine on October 2022 and run out of them in February 2023 bravo!!!  And that was because I had to travel to different countries so I ended taking small amounts in my containers when I when to Europe. Then on my way back I travel to Mexico so I took all the bottles because I was going to stay there 3 months. Then my set got finished there   I checked in the fine stores in Mexico but there were no Refills so I had to I'm wait till I return to USA to buy them. I'm strongly recommending the Lancôme Absolute products they all wonderful! Use them carefully and daily! * I love this product, and I've tried quite a few high end moisturizers. I'm 52 a post menopausal. I only gave it 4* because of the price, and the fragrance.  Most over the age of 50 will likely remember a bottle of White Shoulders sitting on their grandmother or mother's vanity, and that's what the smell of this cream reminds me of. Very floral and not just roses. I can live with the price, but I would definitely give it 5* if Lancôme would make a fragrance free version. The fragrance doesn't linger, but the smell reminds me of what old women smelled like when I was a child."

The product is nicely presented but it just add a layer of products to my skin with no benefit and perhaps add to my dry skin issue. * I've used several Estée Lauder skincare, especially the Daywear moisturizer with SPF for 18 years. I have combination/oily skin and as much as I loved the products I always struggled with oiliness. I decided to take a break a couple years and I regret it. My skin has significantly changed and not for the better. I tried so many new products and nothing compared. I came back to Estee Lauder and decided to try this Nutritious line, and I absolutely love it!!! This one does not make me oily or shiny and I love the way my Estee Lauder foundation sits on my skin. I will say I bought a whole regime and I'm using the Nutritious essence and moisturizer, and the Perfectionist serum and SPF. I got them on sale during Black Friday sales recently and I couldn't be happier. I can say this moisturizer is making all the difference for me. * Not for me feels to heavy * I have quite dry skin and this product just doesnt work with my skin type. Makes my face look and feel dehydrated. I can maybe understand why this would work for oily folks but not enough for dry skin. * I got this creme in the Glow kit. When I cleanse my face, I apply it as a standalone and immediately see my face turn red. I have sensitive skin, plus large pores. :( * I don't see the hype. Texture of cream felt like light face lotion and went on just the same. I've used it twice as an over night mask and I woke up with dry skin. My Elemis night cream is 5x more nourishing than this ""face mask"" cream. * I live in the Arctic and the cold sucks any moisture out of my skin. I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts from moisturizers and new products. Basically if you touch it, it's going to have issues. I received a sample of this with my last makeup order and this stuff is amazing! I have been using it as my daily moisturizer and my skin is soft, hydrated, and most of all clear!

So purchase if they have original * In my constant quest for skincare products that deliver real results, I recently tried the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid. This lotion claims to gently exfoliate, boost cell turnover, and provide deep hydration to uncover softer, smoother skin. Let's dive into my experience with this multi-tasking formula.

The lotion is non-greasy and lightweight, making it perfect for daily use. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and hydrated without any heavy residue. The product is fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for those with sensitive skin or a sensitivity to strong scents. The natural smell from the lactic acid salts is subtle and varies slightly depending on your skin's unique pH, but it's not overpowering or unpleasant. * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is revolutionary! It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy!"

It is kinda crazy because I've been using Bare Minerals makeup for 25+ years and never considered the skin care products. On impulse, I picked this up and I'm really glad I did. My skin is really happy. In two weeks it has reduced redness, dryness, and you can't see the lines on my forehead anymore. So if you want results without all the harsh chemicals this is the cream for you. * Been using this for a couple of years. This product usually lasts me 5 months. Am glad for that! * I love how it feels as I am applying it. It feels wonderfully soft and smooth. Will be purchaching more! Love It! * My skin was looking dull and dreary.

265,pacifica,future youth moisturizing super cream,pimprod2042626,2617977," * Just as it says in the title. I use this moisturizer in my night routine because of how moisturizing it is. 
Yes, it does pill if it is not the last step in your routine. It is my 2nd to last step, and depending on how long I wait to apply the oil afterwards, affects how intensely the moisturizer pills. The moisture and effectiveness is worth it though. If I can't give a good 10 minutes before applying oil, then I will just skip the oil that night. * Biggest disappointment from Ulta so far… not moisturizing… for some reason it dehydrates my skin… dont waste your $$$ * This works great! A little goes a very long way. It's very moisturizer yet not oily. I love this night cream. * Doesn't absorb into the skin as quickly as I would like, but once it is, my face and neck are so bright and refreshed. * Keep The Phenoxyethanol out of products please! 
If Europe can ban Endocrine disruptors why cant we. 
This is like the only ""clean brand"" in the states. So dissapponting.. * I have combo acne prone skin for reference. 
This is like a light watery lotion but absorbs like a rich cream. It soaks right in and paces a velvety, supple feeling that I love. Sometimes my skin is drier so I could see me being able to use this during the day also without being too heavy. It does have a scent. It's like candy strawberry and flowers. It's light and goes away very shortly. You only need a little of this because it spreads so well. It can be easy to go overboard. I think this is definitely worth the money given the ingredients, packaging and how long this will last. Especially compared to other creams. I don't breakout but wake up with super soft, nourished skin. * I want to love this product so badly but the fragrance/essential oils in this caused my eczema to flare up. I'm so sad but I know it's on me for buying something with fragrance, natural or not. Otherwise I think it's a nice product it wasn't drying or anything and the texture is really nice just wish they had a fragrance free version. I will stick with the vegan ceremide cream"

I need to use items with SPF already in it, or ill forget. * After reading all the promises I thought this SPF would be perfect, but like other reviews mention this doesnt dry matte at all and I need to use a powder after applying. For the high price this should do what it says. Sounds like there was some sort of change in the formula that ruined it. * This was recommended by my esthetician. And it works well for me. I like that it has sun screen in it and it doesnt seem to make my face oily at all. It works for me. * It left my skin very oily and I bought it because it was supposed to be matte. * I usually break out from sunscreen. Even the one my dermatologist prescribed! I went out on a limb to try this 2 in 1 sunscreen and it did not disappoint. Great mattifying and no white cast (I'm a brown skin gal) yet moisturizing. I took this on vacation and it withstood the very hot heat and sun. Two thumbs up for me. * My previous tube was great. Mattified the skin. Absorbed quickly. It did not make my skin oily. This newest tube is not good. While it still absorbs quickly it does not mattify my skin. I am very oily in a couple of hours if not before. I must note that i do shake the tube before use so i dont think im missing anything. * I used this as a cheaper alternative toy usual SPF  but it was greasy and broke me out.

Yes, the one product is smaller than they said in the details, but all of these still last a long time. The face wash has a really nice light citrus smell. I havent used the moisturizer yet because I couldnt read what it was exactly or when to use it (before looking it up) because the white writing on the transparent container was impossible to read on top of being partially rubbed off.

I picked it up on a whim and now I use it every morning after cleansing and before moisturizing. Its make your skin supple and moisturized. The scent is mild for me personally, I love that it smells like fruit loops lol. Packaging also gets a 10/10 the glass bottle definitley makes it worth the price. Will be repurchasing once I run out (it lasts forever!) * This product has truly shocked me. I have some staple products that I know give my face a glow like no other, but I can't use them every day because they only give me that glow with a few days between uses. I have used this product every day and night for a week, and EVERY SINGLE DAY my face has been almost unrecognizable. I feel pretty with no makeup on for the first time in my life, my makeup sits better on my face when I do use it, and the glow lasts ALL day, well into the night. Oh my goodness, no wonder it's sold out. You can even get away with no moisturizer with this product (I know because I forgot to put moisturizer on one day, that's how good this feels on my skin). For the record, I live in Florida, and have extremely dry skin which actually over produces oil to overcompensate in the humidity. Usually products like this make me break out, but this feels AMAZING. I never have products make my skin glow and not feel oily, but this one really works. This is not a paid review, I only tried this product because of the reviews I saw, bc I'm a creature of habit. I hate trying new products and am terrified of using my skin to test things out.

Aveeno, please don't change this formula ever!! * I am happy this product does not dry out my skin, but I don't feel it will protect my face from sunburn.  That being said, my face was peeling because of the high strength of my lotion. At least it is now not peeling. * The moisturizer did help with my overall skin/was a decent moisturizer, but the pilling is/was so bad, almost constant, even hours after application. It also doesn't sit well under any make-up, even a just light skin tint. The smell is strong, but it honestly just smells like soap so that wasn't an issue for me and I kind of liked it. * This product is light and smells good.  I love that it has SPF. * I've used it for over 10 years. There's been changes with it over the years, but my skin soaks it up like a sponge and leaves me glowing. * Broke me out in hives!

Would I use it over my tatcha water cream maybe not but it will stay in rotation! Little to no scent which I enjoy * I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. 

Let's just start of by saying there is no weird smell what so over. The packing is great because I carry it with me everywhere and doesn't spell despite it's more watery like texture. This is a great moisturizer for girlys that don't like to feel sticky or oily afterwards (because this product does not do that). I would definitely purchase again. * I received this item free in exchange for my honest review. The light, gel like formula of this moisturizer is perfect for the warmer weather. It wears wonderfully under makeup without being too heavy.

This is the first sunscreen I have ever used on my face that didn't eventually make me feel like a greasy slob later in the day. I have very dry skin and it feels just as luxurious as any other high-end moisturizer that I put on my face as well as giving my skin a plump, glassy finish. I have noticed some occasional mild burning on the skin around my eyes, but only when I use it in conjunction with certain other products. I just now avoid using those two products together. I will definitely be re-purchasing this SPF. Hopefully itll be half price on an upcoming sale. * I am veryyy picky when it comes to SPF moisturizers. I need it to be moisturizing without making my skin greasy, the texture can not be runny, and it needs to be a high enough SPF without leaving a white cast and feeling/smelling like sunscreen. When i had to switch spf moisturizers because of an allergy to my old one, i was stressed that i'd never find another product that could tick off all my boxes, but then i found this one! * I love the original moisturizer and now with SPF is amazing. I own the tinted version as well, but feel like the tinted makes me look greasy after an hour... where as this version is more of a satin finish where I do not look greasy throughout the day (maybe a little bit on my nose after 6 hours of wear). If you're sensitive to chemical sunscreens, I will say I notice my eyes get a tad bit irritated from it after about 6 hours of wear also. I try to not get close to my eye area, especially on my eyelids with this version. Overall would repurchase. The Paula's Choice Youth Extending Fluid is very close to this with 50spf and I feel doesn't give me the sensitivity. * I work at ulta and I personally would not recommend this to anyone. Ive tried to use this many different ways and everytime Ive used it, it pills up immeditaly even with no other product and others that are also water based. * Have complained about packaging previously -- the convex bottom cap will not sit upright on shelf / counter. Then I couldn't access any product from the pump / tube so I returned it for an in-store replacement. This tube feels light weight-wise, but I am able to pump product out of tube. Suggest you return to previous packaging that had no issues. Meanwhile I'm looking around for a replacement. * Perfect sunscreen.  Lightweight yet moisturizing. * I used my sister's.  I really liked it.  Easy to use, it didn't leave a white cast, I like everything about it.  I have to buy my own now.  My sister won't let me have hers!"

I really enjoy the product and like my skin doesn't feel super greasy. My only minor issue, is the smell is a bit odd for me, it's very tolerable it's just a bit odd for me. Also, this is better suited for summer time and warmer climates and can feel a bit drying in the winter so just be aware of that as well. But overall great product * Love this product, I have been using it for 2+ years. No scent, lightweight, absorbs well. I love this gel moisturizer. * I thooght id like this lighter gel facial moisturizer because i habe pretty pily skin bit ots jist notnfor me. Ive been using prodicts to help ansorb oil and actually need a PM moisturizer bit this one does not do the trick amd atill leaves my fave feeling dry at night. I think i will ne switching bavk to the  Dermalogica skin smooyhing moisturizer afyer im done with this bottle. * this keeps my skin hydrated. its great for the oily places on my face. * Great for oily, acne prone skin. It's very lightweight + smells good (even though it's not a scented product). The packaging isn't the most aesthetic but that doesn't stop it from being an amazing product! You can also get this product in their acne clearing kit, along with a foaming face wash and spot treatment. Love it! * Got this moisturizer as a wake me up for the cooling effect, but the amount of product doesnt even cross the verticle E in ""clear"" written on the front of the bottle. Highly disappointed because had i noticed before using it, I would have returned it."
277,pacifica,vegan collagen every day lotion spf 30,pimprod2017151,2566493," * It's a cute bottle but it jsut smells like straight sunscreen. It's not that greasy but it's nothing special. * Love this for daytime. Light, and I don't need very much. Gentle on my sensitive skin. * We accidentally ran out of this, and we will never take this product for granted again! * It was just too greasy it started to break my skin out * I generally love Pacifica and have only purchased vegan/cruelty free products for the past 30 or so years. My usual store didn't have Andalou SPF face lotion anymore, which I've used religiously and happily for many years, and this was the closest alternative. I have never had a bad reaction to any lotion but this one irritates my eyes horribly, to the point of not being able to drive safely and having to wash my face and flush my eyes. Do not recommend! * I love this brand and I was excited to find a daily moisturizer from them with spf and even went through several bottles but I had to stop using it because it caused my eyes to burn and water profusely. I would also add that it has a very oily finish, so if you have oily or combo skin, this likely isn't for you. * I've used this through a couple of bottles. My skin takes time to adjust to products (hence why the couple of bottles). 

I love that it is cruelty free and has vegan collagen. I love that it has SPF 30, a must for me, BUT it smells like sunscreen. It is definitely moisturizing, I don't have an issue with dry skin, BUT it's rather greasy. My daughter has even commented that my face is really greasy when I wear it (not really the vibe I'm going for). The chemicals burn my eyes as the day goes on. If I even wipe my eyes, it takes me minutes to wipe away whatever traces of this moisturizer is around my eyes. If I regularly wore makeup, this would be extra problematic. If you wear contacts, I do not recommend this. Imagine that burning getting caught up under your contacts.

I really, really wanted to love this because I didn't want to go through having my skin adjust to a new product, but I can't justify it based on it being a habit."
278,clarins,extra-firming & smoothing night moisturizer,pimprod2031267,2592833," * This was recommended to me by an employee. I have never used clarins before so I took a leap of faith. Big mistake. 

It does nothing for my skin… super greasy, no firming, and makes my skin look worse. For the price I expected at least a decent product. In my opinion there are SO many great moisturizers out there that out perform this and are cheaper. * Bought this because I like the day cream version a lot.  This however was just not a great formulation for me.  It simply NEVER absorbs into my skin and then it just rubs off on my pillow case or hands eventually.   And I don't use an excessive amount because of the price tag.  I'm a big fan of using the minimal amount required.  It's too late to return it, so it's just going to move into my graveyard of products that I can't bare to throw away because, $$$, but just don't work on my skin.  Le sigh.  But, I still love the extra firming day cream and all my other Clarins products.  I would recommend trying a sample of this before buying if possible so you know if it's a good consistency for your skin. * Excellent result 👍 * Light weight, non greasy.  Plant enriched.  Vegan.  Long lasting.  Eco friendly packaging. * Really recommend this line for girls after 50. I feel my face firming after second week and continue improving. * This product is amazing!"

It also went bad pretty quickly and started to smell like pungent onions (no smell initially). * Great intro to retinol. I have sensitive, acne prone, oily skin. This did not irritate my skin, and honestly it has improved my acne. My skin has never looked better with Cosrx and i've been struggling with my skin since middle school. I am now 26. * This stuff is GOLD. I had never used retinol and read that a small percentage is the best way to start and wow. Every night I put this on my skin is instantly dewy, glowy, and looks so fresh. It's been a game changer in my skin care routine"
280,origins,dr. andrew weil mega-mushroom soothing treatment lotion,pimprod2031368,2593778," * I put this in a small spray bottle to use as it's a liquid and don't want to waste any. * I thought i was getting a cream lotion but no, this is a liqued, you apply it like a serum/toner before your serums and moisturizers. But the product is hydrating but does not reduce redness as much as i hoped it would. * Helps SO much with redness from sun damage! * I Have Used This Toner For Over 5 Years & I Have Loved It. Its The Only Toner I Go Back To Because In Its First Use You Can See The Dirt That Is Removed From Your Face & In Every Use. You Can Visually & Physically Feel/Tell The Difference When Using This Product. I Like To Add Some Into A Spray Bottle & Then Remove Excess With A Cotton Pad. This Also Helped Me Years Back When I Was Having A Long Going Acne Breakout. I Have Not Had Any Problems With This Product & Will Continue Using. * I did not find this product to be soothing. Instead of reducing redness it seemed to make my skin more red. It left my skin feeling sticky instead of moisturized. My skin is a little sensitive, but i dont usually have to stop using products without finishing them. * I have mild rosacea. I am not consistent in my skincare routine, I will get some surface acne.   I implemented it into my current routine and used it consistently for 3 months. After about 6 weeks, I tried some variations to ensure that there wasn't interaction with what I was using. It did not exacerbate redness or irritate; however it also, did nothing else. The earthy smell dissipates as it dries. Nothing changed  I would not waste my money in the future on this particular product. * I have rosacea and this product helps to soothe redness and prevent further reactivity. It feels good on the skin and smells great."
281,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial advanced repair barrier cream,pimprod2036682,2603779," * Good but expensive and not much product!! * Pricey for the small amount you get but it definitely feels amazing and a little goes a long way!! * This product has helped save my skin! Wearing the mask during Covid killed my skin barrier and I have not been able to revive it. Every product I have tryed has given me cystic acne or i have had a horrible reaction to it. And just when I thought all hope was lost this 💎 was recommended to me. I was a little weary as its a cream and feels like a balm. I am oily to combo and anything thick just make we more oily. This absorbs great as long as you dont over use it so find your sweet spot. Start out with a little cuz it goes a long way. This helps Hydrate my skin while I useing active to clear it up my breakouts. * While it does feel nice initially when you put it on that fades quickly and just makes my face feel tight. Absolutely not worth the price point. There are more hydrating options out there. * I have dry, sensitive skin & this cream has been a game changer for my skin. I love that this balm doesn't have shea butter like most balms because i suffer from acne & cannot use that ingredient on skin. This cream has cleared my acne (i assume because it has salicylic acid) & my skin just looks & feels so much healthier. I love it so much, but like someone else said in the comments…I wish they made a bigger size because i go through this stuff so quick since i use it day & night. * I have extremely dry skin. It's very sensitve and reactive due to an autoimmune disease. I can use hardly anything on my face. I use and like the Kiehl's cica but thought this would be better with the colder temps now. It's not. Skin is dryer and I can tell my skin barrier is unhappy now. It reminds me of using body lotion on your face (which I've tried a few times) it leaves a chalky matte finish too. Not good for my middle aged skin. 
Their Cica cream is far superior and so is anything by Ursa Major for all you out there with unhappy dry skin. This doesnt cut it as a facial lotion. * This is vry healing on my dry skin. It gave me a couple of whiteheads on my face, but I noticed that it really calmed the redness. It's a trade-off. I would rather cover a pimple with a little makeup rather than cover up the redness all over my face."

My 33 year old skin looks phenomenal! It's so moisturizing and soft on my skin with a beautiful glow. * Easily the BEST anti-aging deeply hydrating moisturizer I've ever used!!!! I've not only purchased the entire live for myself but family members and it's worth every penny. A LITTLE goes a long way! * The best face cream I have ever used. * This face cream was so expensive and I felt it didn't work for me. It made my face very sensitive and my foundation didn't stay well on top it. I was disappointed but will try something new. * I am loving the results of these products. * I've tried MANY MANY moisturizers. this one is THE BEST hands down! Use it day 1 and your face feels like a babys butt the very next day. That's how fast and amazing this stuff works. Nothing will make your skins feel this soft and supple. And no breakouts! (a few moisturizers make me break out for some reason but not this) The only downside is the price; it's horrendously expensive so I hafta wait until my bday & xmas gift cards and rewards points to buy it so I only buy it about once a year. A little goes along way so I can make it last a few months. I'm 56 with normal to dry skin. * I have used it for a week now. Like the way my skin feels I use it at night. Packaging is a little over the top. Contents is a lot smaller than it appears from the outside.

A little goes such a long way super hydrating and works well with my vitamin c!! * I been using it for 6 months and my skin is so beautiful and glowing * Definitly added to my skin care routine. I use Fenty Beauty's cleanser, toner and Moisturizer and after the fenty moisturizer soaks into my skin I then add this butter and its the missing piece the cherry on top! * My skin has been feeling dry for months this is the only thing that has helped make my skin feel close to normal again"

I wanted to try something new and saw good reviews for this product so I gave it a try and truly wish I hadn't. This moisturizer is heavy and sticky. It leaves my skin feeling…. just gross. It made my skin break out in these weird tiny bumps and caused an acne flare up. I would not recommend this product. * this is a very nice moisturizer BUT it pills horribly. it messes up the makeup i put on top of it everytime. no matter how much i rubbed it in. will be returned. * Melts onto my skin. Doesn't feel heavy * As someone who struggles with rosacea, its hard to find skincare I like. This moisturizes, calms, and makes my skin feel soft and supple without making it feel greasy. It's definitely a new favorite!"
288,nyx professional makeup,face freezie cooling hydration moisturizer + primer,pimprod2038044,2605421," * The texture looked interesting in store, and since I liked other NYX primers, I thought I'd give it a go. After multiple uses, I can confidently say that this product does nothing for me (literally). My skin feels no different when I put it on, and I haven't noticed it making my makeup look better or last longer compared to not wearing a primer at all. The cooling effect makes it not for use around the eyes, but that's exactly where I need my primer to focus on my concealer. Disappointed that NYX traded their Angel Veil shelf space for this product line… definitely not worth the price tag! * I really found this primer to be cooling soothing, and just overall a very good quality product before applying foundation. I would definitely buy it again. * Would not buy  this again..reminded me of that menthol bio freeze cream that's been water down about 90 percent..its aweful..it took forever to stop that feeling..and it made my eyes burn..even though I didn't put on eyes.. * I'm obsessed with this product.  The texture is like nothing I've ever felt.  It's somehow soft and fluffy/bouncy feeling but oh so cooling and hydrating on the skin.  I love it so much and use daily.  Will definitely repurchase! * Use daily * Great moisturizer/primary. I just put a serum on and then use this. It goes on smooth and lasts all day with no oil even though i have combo oily skin. I definiely recommend! * I have had extremely dry skin since i was born & i have tried dozens of hydrating primers from drugstore to luxury & this is by far is the best one that i have used. This is the first primer that i have used that doesn't leave my face looking dry & patchy after using foundation & powder. It also is very cooling so be careful around your eyes. It's also very good for sensitive skin & hasn't caused acne tk break-out. The only reason I'm taking a star off is because I don't really see any difference with my pores. I absolutely recommend this especially if most primers cause you to break-out."

I love how this also acts like a primer, my makeup stays on really well when I use this. * I got this wanting a moisturizer with spf since I have tinted moisturizer for makeup. This was not what I was hoping it would be. It was really sticky and it didn't really feel like moisturizer. I ended up returning. * I have very sensitive dry skin, I've been searching for over a year for the perfect mineral sunscreen that doesn't cause acne or dry me out, I think I've finally found it!!! it can feel greasy when you first put it on but quickly absorbs. I reapply throughout the day, and honestly LOVE this product. it's so amazing. I bought it on a whim thinking I would end up hating it too like all the others I've tried, but I believe I found my sunscreen!!! I've been using it for almost 3 weeks multiple times throughout the day!! * I love this sunscreen because of the high Zinc Oxide for UBA/UVA rays and the ingredients make me glow! It absorbs pretty quickly and you won't feel oily as the day goes on. No eye irritation. It does reflect the sun light away from your skin. * 100% my favorite ever. Yuka has it wrong I looked up the ingredients myself and this one is my favorite. * Horrible product it gave me a rash. Supper greasy and leaves a white cast.

A must have! * Best moisturizer I've used and I've used many.  A little goes a long way. * Ive been using this product for about a year now (i think) maybe a few months less than that.. I do like it, I can feel how it seems to be tightening my skin.. But, i havent noticed any difference. I have noticed at the very top where my hair line is, it gets super dry. I am not sure if it is the moisturizer or what but i have tried several different shampoos and conditioners and still have the problem. But i havent tried a different moisturizer yet. The smell does not bother me, it does smell good. I do feel like it isn't as moisturizing as it should be though… I really wish I could find the old Chanel Hydra Micro Creme! 

Honestly, I believe this moisturizer just depends on your skin type. I use it with my Chanel foundation.. I am still iffy about it because I feel like it also shows my ""fine lines"" more but I am not very good with all of this anyway. Lol * I unfortunately have sensitive skin, I find the fragrance to be irritating on me. Plus I have a bit of a break out coming in from hormones. I've been trying it for a while, I really wanted to love it. * Best product ever. * The No 1 Chanel line is phenomenal. I have 3 products now and will continue to add more. This is just what my ""mature"" skin needed. 
Thank you Katarina…Chanel and Ulta are lucky to have such a professional, knowledgeable and kind associate! * I got this as a sample and I immediately bought it once it ran out. I live in the desert so my skin gets really dry with the weather here, this moisturizer has been the only thing that's been able to hydrate my skin without leaving it greasy and my pores look like they're getting smaller.

GAME CHANGING * It burns and apparently I'm not alone. I don't have very sensitive skin. This immediately made my face hot and stingy. Then the oil production kicked up. This is not wearable for me. * I mix this with my sunscreen and foundation. It gives a subtle glow and a bit  of moisture. For reference I have oily skin and ive had no issues incorporating into my makeup routine. * I've tried their regular moisturizer before & I loved it. However, this makes me feel like my skin is burning when I put it on. it's not too moisturing either. * Have used GLAMGLO and it is no longer available. So, I did some research and started to use ELEMIS. I guess it's ok except for the bottle it comes in, terrible. Very hard to come out, I ended up cutting it open and put the contents in a jar. Advice, change the container * I got a sample from ipsy— ordinarily I would not go for shimmery products but this gives such a healthy, natural glow on mornings that i dont have time to slap on layers of serum.

The dispenser is also great for avoiding contamination and spoilage of product. I also use it on the backs of my hands to hopefully discourage age spots down the road. * I do not have 'sensitive skin' type and yet this severly dried out my skin and it felt painful like a sunburn. I gave it a few tries I thought my skin was drying out because of the cooler weather but nope, this was the culprit! I cannot even fathom paying full price for this product. * I dont like the scent. It smells good when you're putting it on, but then it makes your pillow smell like wet dog. This dried out my face horribly and created big dry patches under my eyes and above my eyelids. I have to return it. * My skin is extremely sensitive to new products, especially retinols. This took a few weeks to get used to, but I'm now using it almost every night. My skin has SO much more life to it! * I recently switched my skincare line from Lancôme to Kate Somerville and let me just say that my face hasn't looked or felt this good in years. I have seen more results in only a few short weeks than I ever did with Lancôme. AND this line is less expensive. It's a win win! * For the first two weeks, everything was fine.

A lot of gel creams dry down to nothing after an hour or two but this stays a lonnnng time. I literally use it like a nighttime rich cream, that's how nourishing it is. I tried the new vitamin c cream from Olehenriksen but its not as good as this OG one. May they never ever discontinue or reformulate! * My skin never looked better since using this entire line * you have no idea how many moisturizers I tried in my life and this became in my top 3. omg the glow I get with this is unreal. i get so many compliments from people about my skin when I use it. it doesn't break me out, it actually helped me clear my skin ! i will buy this again and again and I hope they will not change the formula! * I went on a trip and only brought this moisturizer for face and body. I got a little sunburn and used this and the burn went away over night with no peeling. I will forever use this as my after sun lotion. Highly recommend. * After using this product once I woke up the next morning with severe redness and achne-like bumps over my entire face!! I wanted to itch my face off it was so bad. Once I removed the product my face started to calm down. My skin is never sensitive like this, but it did NOT like this product what-so-ever!! * I wouldn't say that I am a fan of any skincare product, I hope they just do their job. Nothing has floored me like this skincare line. I bought this moisturizer because I bought the eye cream a couple weeks ago and LOVED IT. I can actually feel these products working on my skin. I've been blessed with normal skin and I can actually feel the benefits of this product. I feel moisturized and my skin feels ""alive"". I would highly recommend. * Big fan of Ole Henriksen products.

The patches on my legs are taking a little longer but it is improving every day, and the redness is fading.
It doesn't smell very nice. I know it's because they don't add any artificial fragrance and what you are smelling is the natural scent of the active ingredients. To get around that I mix it with some scented dry body oil.
I will keep using this! Bring it on, high-elevation dry winter climate, I found your match! * Purchased based on 5 star reviews but it smells like self tanner.

By the end of the week, my skin looked more even-toned, and some of my dark spots had started to fade. The gentle exfoliation from the lactic acid helped in renewing my skin without causing any irritation or redness—a common issue I face with more aggressive exfoliants. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid exceeded my expectations! This dynamic blend of lactic acid and vitamin C not only brightens my complexion but also gently exfoliates. My skin feels smoother and looks more radiant. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula makes it ideal for use under makeup. This lotion has swiftly become one of my top choices for achieving a glowing, healthy appearance. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C is perfect for my normal to dry skin. It also brightens and evens out my skin. I love to apply it when my legs are out for a natural glow! * Looking for bright and radiant skin? Look no further! The lightweight moisturizing lotion contains 7% lactic acid for gentle exfoliation and Vitamin C for skin that will look glowy and fresh! My skin looks smoother and softer after just a few days! * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid is a staple especially for the Summer. I'm always on the hunt for some sort of vitamin c lotion. Since we have hard water that can be so tedious. Not only does it help repair my skin but I also get to brighten my skin at the same time."

This one is not for me but Olay doesn't make it easy to know which one of their products to use. * I purchased this moisturizer from Ulta and it arrived within a few days. I use the product both morning and evening even if I am supposed to only use it once a day. My skin appears brighter and it is definitely smoother. I even use it on my neck but so far I haven't noticed a difference there. * This smooths my face and doesn't cause breakouts which so many moisturizers do. I haven't found a moisturizer yet that doesn't break me out. It lasts all day and works well underneath your makeup or by itself. I definitely plan on continuing to use this. * A couple months back I went on vacation to the Bahamas where my skin ended up breaking out very badly.  I brought this moisturizer with. It felt like my face was burning off and every time I took a shower more skin peeled off my face. It was the most miserable time ever. I assumed it had something to do with the trip. A couple days ago I tried this product again, the next morning the same thing happened, immediately this time. My face is burning, feels hot to the touch, bright red and is breaking out with little bumps all over and starting to do that gross oozy thing again. Now I realize it's this moisturizer. It might be awesome on some, just not me. I really wanted to like this product but I wouldn't wish this horrible reaction on anybody. So I guess just be cautious and if you notice something doesn't feel right, stop using it immediately. * This stuff isnt just great for your face, but can work on other sensitive areas too. I had dark marks/hyperpigmentation left behind from a medical adhesive left on my thigh too long, and this genuinely helped to fade those lines to a point where they are less noticeable * I love the way this smells. I use it in the mornings, a little hint of citrus smell is nice to give you a little wake up. Goes on a little sticky, but drys smooth and soft. Definitely recommend."

I will definitely buy it again!! * I have acne rosacea along with endometriosis, so my skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and breakouts so easily. I have tried every moisturizer from the drugstore to my dermatologist prescriptions, and nothing, I mean nothing has compared to this. this has not made my face itch, burn, or breakout. it actually took away about 90% of my redness in the first 24 hours i used it. i never thought Chanel would be my life line, but its now my holy grail. if you are truly sensitive, and not just ""sensitive"" like the majority of women say and they use like Cerave on their skin, but seriously have sensitive skin, try this out. you wont be disappointed. id rather pay more for quality ingredients than anything from a drugstore."
302,vichy,minÃ©ral 89 fragrance free cream,pimprod2039914,2613655," * Yes, I know the packaging isn't sexy or exciting. And no, this product probably isn't trending on Tiktok at the moment. However, this is one of the absolute best and most luxurious face creams I've ever used, and at a desirable price point. It leaves my cracked, painful and psoriasis-prone face plump, dewy, glowy and hydrated for the entire day or night. It performs better than the majority of my high end brand creams do and is extremely gentle. Highly recommend trying. * It moisturizes my skin too much! It looks great under makeup, you wake up as if you had just washed your face, I love it! Super moisturizing. * I am of the darker persuasion in her late 30s and it is hard to find a moisturizer that does not over power you with the smell. But this, this one is lovely. It goes on like butter ladies. Trust me it blends well with other products too. * This cream smells like the airplane cabin bathroom pink hand soap, which is slightly offputting. It also feels thick and heavy without seeming to sufficiently moisturize my face, so I think this formula just isn't for me."
303,cetaphil,healthy renew purified peptides broad spectrum spf 30 day cream,pimprod2041297,2611322," * This absorbs nicely and I think it's working. * Feels heavy and uncomfortable.Definitely not suitable for acne prone/oily skin.If you have dry skin this is for you. It leaves a beautiful glow and deeply hydrates but again, not for oily skin or if you leave in hot weather.Too heavy for a day cream * I got this product with high hopes. It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy. I don't like the packaging, but i've noticed a lot of brands going this route so its whatever. I would recommend it though."

And it really does make your skin look like glass! * Perfect lightweight moisturizer for hot summer days! * Heard some good reviews about it and I also happened to try their cleanser once and I liked it so I decided to give this a try and after a few days of using I BROKE OUT so bad. All around my face and under chin. My money just went to waste. SO DISAPPOINTED * It really makes my skin look like glass! Would love to try the mist also * As other reviewers said it causes little white pumps on my t zone area and it doesn't do anything. * This product is very moisturizing I have been using this for 2 weeks and it's amazing"

I'm not a fan of the aluminum tube it comes in but that's not a deal breaker for me. Run to buy this! * This PM Hydration to rebuild and protect your bodies best defense, your skin barrier is incredible! I have very sensitive skin and so many issues with my skin from aging, etc and  this night cream is the answer. My spouse Loves it and uses it too! * Great price point, and appealing ingredients for my skin type. I don't know why, but it seems to sap water out of my skin. Long term use gave me dryness and temporary wrinkles. It might be due to my climate. * So moisturizing and i have noticed a huge difference in my skin when i wake up, softer and clearer. I have oily acne prone skin and I've experienced no breakouts or excess oil during the day. * I got this whole line on a whim and i can definitely say its healed my skin barrier and got rid of my acne. This stuff goes on smooth and feels so good on my face, i wake up very refreshed, the spf in the morning version is a plus. Thank you ROC🧡😁 * I've been struggling with adult acne for about 2 years now. One of the things I've learned is if your skin barrier is shot - you're not going to heal your acne. This product has significantly improved my skin for the better. It truly does what it says: improves skin barrier. It also will help heal a breakout literally overnight which is amazing! * Been using it at night after my HA application and waking up with silky soft skin with faded blemish appearance. Will buy again."

This is my first time using this in my routine but I really like it and I am seeing a smoother face in the a.m. I am a ROC user and love their products. * I love the way it feels on my face. It is not oily or greasy. I haven't used it long enough to notice if it helps with wrinkles but I will let you know later. Some moisturizers feel sticky when you put it on, this one does not. It also has a nice smell to it. * I have been using this Hydrating cream for over one year now. I like how it works and how it makes my skin feel. * found this product on sale and thought I would give it a try, and so far, I really like it - feels nice and haven't had any bad reactions, nice find * Wow! I was blown away by how effective this max hydration cream by ROC is! When you first apply this you can feel it deeply hydrating your skin. It's fast absorbing and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. After about a week of use i started to notice a slight reduction of my visible fine lines and wrinkles. After about 3 weeks to a month of use I have much firmer skin. This cream is amazing! 
Contains Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol for maximum results. Dermatologist tested. Paraben free. Non comedogenic. Non irritating and fragrance free. 
I received this product free from Roc & PinchMe. * So gar I'm enjoying the  line smoothing max hydration cream. It's a bit thicker than I anticipated but it's creamy enough the it goes on smooth. After just a few days I noticed how hydrated my skin feels. I can't wait to see what the future holds in continuing this product.  Because I sure need it. Retinol these lines honey.. retinol these lines lol. Thanks ulta * ١like the effectiveness, moisturizing, and skin softness of the product. They mention it works well, leaves their faces feeling hydrated, and is the absolute best moisturizer they have ever tried. Some appreciate wrinkle reduction and the skin look. However,I have reported that the product can irritate sensitive skin and burn their eyes. Opinions are mixed on the scent and value for money."

I dont Understand why skincare companies think they need to add such strong fragrance to their products. Will be returning this product. * I started using this about a month ago and I love it! So this will now be two of their skincare products I really like and does the job. And again, affordable! I use it in my morning routine and feels great! Goes on smooth and light weight. I would recommend! * I just bought this came home put it on and instantly got a headache from the strong perfume smell. It's like they dumped a whole bottle of floral old lady perfume in this moisturizer. I looked at the ingredients and it actually says perfume and that shouldn't be in a face moisturizer. Returning this immediately * I used it for the first time a month ago … my skin is glowing    It looks firmer and I definitely will buy again * I dont know what it is about this product but even if it is the onky thing I wear that day it atill peels and clumps on my skin after it dries.

Great for light daily moisture coverage use after cleansing. * I have acne but also dry skin and this product was a solution for good hydration without adding any oil on my face. VERY good for moisturizing before doing your makeup. I live in Boston but also part in Florida and this product does not fail me. * I really wanted to love this. It smells amazing, it goes on feeling really nice and moisturizing. a little goes a long way. But the dry down is where it gets bad. it feels tacky and sticky and a weird gritty feeling that i just can't get past. It's hard to really describe but i just know i do not like how my skin feels after using this. I can't decide if i want to return it immediately or give it a chance for a week. It was a lot of money to spend to not love a product i use twice a day. * There's something about this that just feels a little luxurious. I purchased this on a black Friday sale otherwise I don't think I would've spent the money. Now that I've used it I will definitely repurchase in the future, even at the regular cost because I think it is worth it. I have oily skin and most moisturizers leave my skin oily because they are just too thick and creamy. This moisturizer is very thin and watery and glides on your face very smoothly and doesn't leave me feeling oily. I'm also a big fan of the rose smell. * this product is incredible!so glowy and hydrating!! also feels so luxurious! * I love that it's not greasy. I have acne prone skin and it doesn't make me break out. * Love this moisturizer! Definitely hydrating and it smells divine"
313,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial moisturizer spf 30,pimprod2002927,2536697," * A great product. * This may be a decent moisturizer for winter or indoor not sweating use. Do not use for outdoor activities. It will burn your eyes SO badly. I don't have sensitive eyes or skin but I was practically blind on a summer hike. Horrible! I expect more from a brand like this. * I do have to say I only just tried this product so I'm unsure if it will break me out in the future. However it feels lovely on my skin. Before I applied this product I had some slight dry patches on my skin and it noticeably reduced the dryness. It didn't leave any white cast on my skin (I do have very fair skin though) and it made my skin looks very dewy and glowing! I would definitely recommend this product :) * I really do not understand the bad reviews. This is a great moisturizer with SPF in it. I personally like an all in one product and with 4.2 ounces you get a good value for your money. Not only does this have great ingredients, it is hydrating, sinks into your skin very easily, doesn't leave a white cast, and does not make your eyes burn. My skin glows after applying and it also wears SO well under makeup!! I do not find this sunscreen to be greasy at all. It actually makes me less oily throughout the day compared to the other SPF moisturizer I was using previously. I was using the Cerave AM lotion but wasn't in love with it as it took a lot of TLC to blend in and made my makeup pill. I was recommended this product by a friend and I am so glad I bought this. For those concerned about fragrance I notice a very very slight sunscreen smell but it doesn't bother me and I am someone who is sensitive to scents. This is a chemical sunscreen so some people may be sensitive to that. I am someone who isn't. I prefer chemical sunscreens anyway because they usually do not leave a white cast and are more hydrating. Mineral sunscreens are always too drying for my skin and leave too much of a whitecast. * I love this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I just love how it applies and how moisturized my skin feels afterwards. * It's ok. Def more of a sunscreen feel. Doesn't leave a white cast but takes a while to soak in. I have to wait quite awhile before I can begin applying my makeup. Like a lot of Kiehl's products but won't buy this one again. * I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now and I swear by it. I put it on in the morning before applying my makeup and it works perfectly. I've found that some moisturizers make my foundation look kinda wonky, but my makeup goes on top of this one nicely. Also, I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this product. I'm never going back!"

Will be buying again and again * I started using retinol months ago, and my skin was so irritated that I had to put moisturizer on every hour to not be in pain. My dermatologist gave me a sample of the Cetaphil cream and I love it. I repackage it in a squeeze bottle for easier application. * I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin and this moisturizer is great! It is truly frangrance free: no chemical smell, just completely neutral. It is not greasy and it absorbs quickly. I like that it's in a tub so there's no product wasted. * Love how it makes my skin soft . & helps my old skin with age spots & bruising * my sensitive skin gets dry over time and this helps it a lot. I am 10 years old and I live in Florida so this is a must-have * This product received the National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance, as listed on the NEA website. I passed over this product for years because the package does not include the seal. I was absolutely missing out. This jar cream is the best body moisturizer I have ever used on my eczema, dermatographia, contact dermatitis, and other skin disorders. It has absolutely helped my skin heal from flare ups as well as help prevent new ones. I do not use this on my face so I cannot speak to its effect on acne. It's comforting and relieving to know I have finally found something to mitigate the suffering. No more intense burning pain just from water or scratching until the skin is raw. This is not a beauty product to me, it's a medical necessity helping my quality of life. Be patient and give this a try, your skin will get better. * Im currently using this moisturizer along with a 10% Benzoyl peroxide cleanser and its the best. My skin type is dry but acne prone fyi. This moisturizer can be used for the face and body and my skin does not feel dry or tight, Simply moisturized."

Helped minimize fine lines after minths of use . * Although I enjoy the smell, the bottle is manufactured so terribly that even the lightest pressure expels the cream outside and under the lid. It is already half way gone with only using it a half full of times because the lid does not lock and stay in place! Highly disappointed. * I need C10 now! * Vitamin C does wonders for your skin. I use this for daytime care in conjunction with the Redermic R in the evening. It's a great combo ! * I use Redermic C every morning as my moisturizer.  I put it on, let it stay on a few minutes to absorb, and then apply my foundation and other makeup. * I use for 1 year and my skin now looks better, my Dermatologist recommended it 👌🏼 * I used to use Dr Perricone products which are great but pricey so I read about the LaRoche line and some have gotten rewards from New Beauty Magazine. I gave it a try and I am very happy with the results ! I use Redermic R every other night and the Redermic C everyday in the morning. My skin looks and feels the same as when I used Perricone products. It consistently delivers."

The idea that it helps to brighten the skin without Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) won me over. I find Vitamin C can be too aggressive on my skin. * I love this moisturizer! Its my favorite to use day in and day out. It has an extremely soft, lightweight texture so its great for daily, but also has so many brightening, moisturizing, and mild resurfacing properties, its also great for my evening regimen as well. Ive noticed a lot of my dark spots evening out, and my skins surface looking more ""glass"" like. The Vitamin C & Beautyberry in this work together so well to be brightening & moisturizing. This is definitely one of my HOLY GRAILS!! * I seen a significant difference in my dark spots with this product! * This cream is amazing! It even tone my skin and took care of the dark spots.

Feels veey light on the skin and not oily. * I was very excited to try out this product bc of hearing great things and hoping that it would help lighten hyperpigmentation that I have on my face but after using it for a few months it did absolutely nothing. Its very light wieght and gives you a glow. Just disappointed. * I love the fresh scent and feel of this lotion. I look forward to using this each morning. * I love this moisterizer. I've tried so many, and my skin always lacked moisture and glow, even when the product stated it would do so. But this one delivers! Instant glow and hydration. I wake up with much better looking skin now. * I enjoyed the nice citrus scent and lightweight feel of this gel like cream. It absorbed quickly into my skin and left it feeling smooth and bouncy. I especially liked how intensely hydrating the cream is without feeling heavy on my skin. It's a delight, but so is everything else from this amazing Korean brand! I'll definitely be adding this to my skincare routine from here on out. I received this sample for free in exchange for my honest review. #pinchme #HAPPYPINCHER * A refreshing smell and feel on my skin. Perfect under foundation. * I had tried a sample of a belif moisturizer and was satisfied with it so when I saw this on sale I jumped on it. Some people complain about the scent but I really enjoy it. Kind of reminds me of fruity pebbles and makes me smile. A little bit goes a long way and works great for my combination skin."
319,panoxyl,am oil control moisturizer with broad spectrum spf 30 mineral sunscreen,pimprod2041857,2615401," * I saw a girl in Tiktok recommend this and figured I'd try since I'm always buying ANYTHING to help makeup. Oil controling primers, setting sprays, foundation etc. and I'm always very shiny by a few hours later. I thought I'd have to deal with it my whole life. I used this and the low level face wash together and WOW its crazy. Hours later, no oily face and even it last day to night to tge next day. At most if I push it, I barely have any oil. I'm so used to being extremely shiny, this is going to be a product I stick to!

It is not very smooth and liquidy/slippery to spread on your face. I use very little swiping motions, I more so like to pat it in my face. I think it does first have a white cast but I think it fades away since it sits on your face. And unlike other reviews I don't get any ""pilling"". Not sure if it's because I always put it on after a fresh clean and damp face. I don't dry my face at all when I'm putting it on. And I dont rub it in too much. I will say I think may be too strong for people who dont have a very oily face 😅. * My holy grail🙏🏼 * Listen to the comments when they say it's too thick and hard to rub on your face. It also leaves flakes on ur skin mid day * Wouldnt buy it again * I treat this moisturizer like a foundation rather than a traditional moisturizer. Works best if i apply section by section. I tap/dab it in rather than rubbing it in, then leave it alone. Playing with it too much will make it pill. Has a bit of a white cast, but it goes away as it sets. I have pale skin anyway, so i cant speak for other skin tones. Sits on my skin like a tinted moisturizer. Even blurs my pores. I dont wear makeup on my skin (only brows/eyes/lips) so i dont know how makeup will sit on it. Reduces oiliness on my skin throughout the day. Healthy glow instead of excess oil/greasiness. Works fantastic for me, but it wont work for everyone. * It's thick and heavy. It also pills even with just a small amount. It for sure does help with oil control but it looks horrible under makeup. Would not recommend. * I bought this moisturizer to replace one I could not find and I hate it. It is super thick and hard to rub into the face. If you touch it without it being fully dry it pills all over the place. On top of that it doesn't really control my oil. By the end of the day I still look like a greasy mess."
