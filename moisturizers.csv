A lil goes a long way with this product. Within the few days I noticed my skin had such a youthful glow. It made my skin look very hydrated and healthy. Very lightweight on my skin. My skin is really oily. And this product didnt make me feel greasy at all. I highly recommend this product.I do not recommend this product.Middle aged white gal. I started using this because it is oil free and my past moisturizers with oil made my skin break out. The breakouts stopped, but now my skin is too dry. Arrrgh! I can't find my happy medium!gel like texture but its super hydrating. i was recommended this product in the ulta store by a worker and it definitely was a great recommendationgel like texture but its super hydrating. i was recommended this product in the ulta store by a worker and it definitely was a great recommendationI am in my 50s and for the past 10 years I don't go out in public without some sort of foundation on my face.

This dried down some and I could feel some tightness on my face. Going back to drugstore cerave nightI would definitely recommend. This sleep mask worked miracles on my dry and oily skin. I love this and I will always use it. Totally recommend!I have been looking for a product to help hydrate my very dry and sensitive skin. I have rosacea and the middle of my cheeks are very sensitive to new products. After I started using this at night it help tremendously. Buy this ASAP!It helped my skin alotIt helped my skin alotI just purchased my second bottle. It does not irritate my rosacea. I feel my skin looks hydrated and plump in the morning.Cute packaging and decent smell, color, and texture! My tween cousin bought it and thanks to the product, she had started to develop  pimples.. not the best for young ages to use overnight or for young girls!"

It feels good as well as looks good. It is such a great product.I loved the non-spf Hope in a jar.  The store was out of that and only had this spf-30 so I bought this.  I returned it.  It doesn't feel the same.  It's greasy and pasty.  After applying makeup, my skin was shiny and oily!
  It doesn't sink into my skin like silk as the other smooth-glow moisturizer does. 
  If you're hoping this version feels like the original, you'll be disappointed.I got this as a trial size and have been hooked ever since.  It feels so nice after I wash my face.  It's not greasy or oily.  My skin really has looked nice and have gotten compliments.  Don't get the SPF30 with it though.  That was oily and pasty.  I didn't like that version.  I use another Philosophy brand with SPF for daytime use.I feel like I walkes out of a spa with this stuff on. Smells wonderful- refreshed ans ready! 

Doesnt feel too thick on face which I love.I've been using Hope in a Jar for many years. I love the way it feels on my skin and my skin never feel dry.This product has been a game changer in my skincare routine! I have been using it for the past month 2x daily and wow!! It really lightens my skin up and gives it a beautiful glow. I also see a difference in the appearance of my skin!! MUST BUY!I've loved this moisturizer for years. Unfortunately it is getting hard to find in-store locally."
4,4,4,drunk elephant,protini polypeptide firming moisturizer,pimprod2028061,2588434,"I previously used this product for 2 years but after my recent one ive noticed no difference , the product has changed and no longer does what is promised will not be purchasing againi've been on antibiotics clearing up a terrible reaction on my face to the protini cream. very harsh product - highly recommend staying away from.This moisturizer doesnt do that much for me. I used it one night and the next morning i woke up with a pimple on my face. I moisturizes okay but it just doesnt do anything for me.Tried this moisturizer out and it gave me a side effect of reddness underneath my eyes along with dry skin (eczema) under my eyes. I've never had eczema before in my life and got it after using the product so i had to discontinue.I really wanted to like this moisturizer, but i just couldn't. I have a longer skincare routine, and I added this to the list. I was doing really well with my skin before I added it. I had no acne or pimples whatsoever! but, unfortunately, I put this moisturizer just on my forhead (because of the polypeptides helping your wrinkles) and I noticed tiny little bumps on it. I also noticed that it is a bit oily.  I sadly cannot use it anymore, but maybe that's just my skintype. The only reason that I give this product 3 stars instead of 2, is that it feels good and cools your face when you put it on.This moisturizer was nothing to write home about. I used it consistently and even gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited until I finished the entire container, but I noticed absolutely NO difference in my skin. The product is thick, heavy, and greasy on the skin - which was terrible for me, as I live in Miami. I have used similar or better products and spent less money, so I will not be repurchasing. 

Only pro of this product is the packaging. I like the hygenic pump and will likely reuse it and fill it with a different moisturizer.I haven't even purchased, but i got a sample for my birthday gift. My skins been looking horrible all week, red and spotty. Used it Ã±ast night and when i woke up all the redness was gone. And my skin looked soooo nice. I guess now i gotta purchase!"
5,5,5,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial cream with squalane,pimprod2002804,2540233,"i got this product 3-4 weeks ago and i havent been putting much makeup on and i noticed blemishes under  my eyes so i stoped using the cream and switched to cetaphil and the blemishes went away.I have used the product for several years. It is lightweight and easily absorbed.I wanted to love this because it makes your skin so soft and it feels weightless - but everytime I've used this product I seem to breakout :(For the last 3 years I've been using a moisturizer that costs $60 for 1.7oz. I tried this because I had a coupon for a free mini. I was hooked after the first use! No pilling, no balling up. It absorbs nicely and my skin feels phenomenal!! I wish I would've tried this moisturizer sooner! My skin looks so plump and hydrated. The texture of this cream is very lightweight, but still feels very moisturizing. I have balanced to dry skin and I am in my 40s. I could see someone with oily skin not liking this especially if their skin is very oily. I love the squalane in this moisturizer. This is my new go to moisturizer, not only is it less expensive than the one I've been using, but it's also much better!!I was skeptical about the price but I have heard so much about this product and I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and it is great! Consistency is good and it's soft on my skin. I would recommend it to anyone.BEST  FACIAL  CREAM  I  HAVE  EVER  USEDI read other comments about it stinging when they put it on and should have listened. That being said, I do have sensitive skin, so if you don't I would still recommend this moisturizer.  It absorbs well and doesn't leave your face feeling greasy."

I found this in-store and decided to give it a try. My skin yearns for moisture but I didn't want a moisturizer that is heavy. I was using a lighter moisturizer for day and using a heavier cream at night. This does an excellent job of moisturizing both day and night. The moisture hangs on all day. My make-up glides on easily in the morning. I can now use one product instead of two, but I am considering trying the night cream. I have been using this for two weeks and I can see a difference in how my skin presents. It looks healthier. The lines arent as noticeable and the skin is more hydrated. I will keep using this product.The old formula was magical. The new one is absolute garbage. 
The old formula felt rich and moisturizing. The new one dries and leaves my skin feeling thirsty. 
I will not repurchase. I would give negative stars if it was possible.The old formula was magical. The new one is absolute garbage. 
The old formula felt rich and moisturizing. The new one dries and leaves my skin feeling thirsty. 
I will not repurchase.I loved this cream. It has the perfect thickness, its very hydrating, and it smelks axing. I also love that its a clean vegan cosmetic. Unfortunately after a few days my super sensitive skin gotca red rash. I stopped using it, took a break and retried it. Same thing. I hate having sensitive skin! If you do t have overly sensitive skin, try this moisturizer because i think youll love it.I turned 40 this year and decided to add more anti-aging products to my skincare regimen. This moisturizer is great for day and night. It smells amazing and a little bit goes a long way. My skin feels so soft and it absorbs well!  I don't have many fine lines but my laugh lines have definitely softened. It is pricey so I'm glad that I don't have to use a lot for it to be effective.This product broke my skin out horribly and caused huge bumps all over my skin!Let me start by saying I never used the old formula. I have extremely sensitive skin, and I was so scared to buy a moisturizer, or any skincare product for that matter, for several months. I went completely virgin with my skincare routine, by only washing my face and not using any makeup at all. When I initially applied this product, it slightly burned my face which concerned me. But I was adamant about making a routine out of this product because I needed SOMETHING to work for my dry skin. I'm glad that I did. After using this product for a month, I'm so happy with how much my skin has dramatically improved and I will continue to buy this product. It doesn't pill for me, unlike some of the negative reviews. It actually purged my skin if anything, and now my acne is almost completely gone. I'm so happy beyond words."

10,10,10,the ordinary,natural moisturizing factors + ha daily moisturizer,pimprod2007113,2551163,"I started using this a few years ago when it came out, is one of the only face lotions I can use that will not spark an eczema flair, yes menopause changed my skin, and this works well.  My young adult kids use it as well and no problems. They have tried many other ones. Dermatologists do recommend this as well since there is not a lot in the formulation than can cause break outs. I am allergic to fragrance (in the skincare realm that could be anything, you don't know till your face tells you). The price point is good.I have a difficult time finding a moisturizer that works for my normal skin. Most are too heavy and sit on top of my skin, feeling too greasy. I was very pleased with this moisturizer. It absorbed immediately, leaving my skin feeling moisturized without tackiness or stickiness.I love the ordinary's hylauronic acid serum, so i thought I'd try this moisturizer as I was in need of a new one. I have super dry and sensitive skin so I figured it would work great. I was wrong, this does not moisturize very well, takes too long to soak in and dare i say leaves a bit of a residue/film on my face. I really wanted this to work so i tried it for 3 weeks and it ended up not at all working for my dry patches and it broke me out. I'm not even acne prone! 
Id say if you have mildly dry skin this could work for you, but for my super dry individuals or anyone with sensitive skin i would skip this one.Wow this shocked me! This product is great doesnt feel greasy my skin feels baby smooth and i have dry senstive-somewhat acne prone skin. I was using a cerave moisturizer but it broke me out and it wasnt giving my skin any hydration at all. And for break outs this moistrizer works great with the Gycolic acid from this same brand as well!I love the Ordinary brand, but this is the first product of theirs I haven't loved. My skin feels dry after using it. It doesn't smell great either but if it worked, I wouldn't care.I love this moisturizer,  I purchased it after it was recommended from a dermatologist on YouTube. It's perfect for me and my sister who have dry skin because of our eczema but with a moisturizer like this we are well hydrated.I'm currently on my 4/5th bottle and I can't go back. Anytime I run out and have to substitute it for another moisturizer I end up breaking out or greasy. This moisturizer is the best quality for the price. Will always recommend."

It didn't matter if I put a ton of the moisturizer on and then product immediately after or is Inised sparingly and waited an hour.  It always pills.  Lastly, I don't see how this is also a primer.  It looks like regular moisturizer on my face.I have been looking for a good primer and this went worked wonders! I absolutely love it and highly recommend.the product works well ad a primer, but it why does it smell like flower perfume? I hate putting scented products on my face and this scent lingers even after make up is applied over it. Wish they would make it unscented, especially for the price point.I bought this in the 1.7 oz and love how far it goes you only need a small amount. I actually went baxk and ordered the 3.4 oz just to have a bigger one. My makeup stays on alot longer and looks great. Its also amazing to use at night time also. I recommend this product to use with or without makeup. Its a bit pricey but I definitely think its worth it.I definitely believe the hype now. This product is amazing, my skin feels so smooth and the product smells divine.This is truly a holy grail staple product in my kit! It's amazing for sensitive skin. Not only that it leaves the face with a subtle and hydrating glow for amazing makeup application or just by itself!I've been using the travel size as a primer and I enjoy it a lot so far. The formula smooths things out without drying the skin, and I only need a quarter-sized amount to cover my whole face. My only gripe is that it is really expensive. Plus, the scent is very strong. I don't mind the orange/citrus smell, but if that's a problem for you then i wouldnt recvomend because the scent is quite strong."

I stopped using all of the extras in my skincare routine because my face was not getting better. I found this product and I use it twice a day. Good for everything. My skin hasn't looked this great in a long time, i owe it all to this moisturizer. Redness immediately subsides. Stayed in the sun too long? Soothing and moisturizing, once again reduces redness. Calms my skin. Repairs my skin. I will buy 50 bottles just in case everyone finds out it is magical. 

Can leave a white cast if you use too much or don't rub it in well enough but i learned quickly that a little goes a long way.I originally was not going to review this because I didnt think it was doing anuthing for my skin but hydrating it.
I got this a couples months back because if the hype. For a while it was causing me to break out. 
I started using this with the Ordinary Salicylic Acid anhydrous solution (bc of my dry skin) at night only and it works wonders. I learned that you need to put a dime size amount on each section of your face. If your face isnt baby smooth after 5-10 minutes of you putting it on, put a little more. I promise this works wonders. If you decide to take my advice, also wear sunscreen!! UV rays in general damage your skin, so if you want clear skin wear suncreen.This is like magic in a bottle, helped heal extremely dry/damaged skin in less than a week! New skincare products tend to break me out but this one doesn't at all, it works best if you use a little at a time.My face has been bright red and burning hot for a few days due to eczema. Aside from the corticosteroid my doctor prescribed me a while back and Aveeno's oat cleansor, everything that touched my skin felt like it was burning. I had to be out in the hot summer weather today and couldn't take it anymore. I saw some dermatologists online recommend this for eczema flare ups, so I ran into Ulta and put it on as soon as I got back in my car. Almost immediately, the burning stopped and my redness went way down. Even though this product doesn't have any cooling effects, it felt like it did because of how fast it got the heat to leave my face. My face finally feels soft and soothed and several hours later, my redness is now gone. This stuff is magic for eczema. I will use this forever, at least as long as they continue to make this product.I used it today before going to sleep  , its a little thick , but it does feel very hydating and gave my skin a healthy glow , i also used it on my hands since they get dry due to dishes , i just wish for that price it was a little bigger or atleast they should give size options .I wish I could upload a picture of my skin. Put it on last night and woke up to half of my face full of pimples/hives and extremely itchy. Had a similar issue with a serum from this brand but wanted to give this product a try. Please be careful if you have sensitive skin."

Every time I begin to debate repurchasing (due to the price point), I get mistaken for being 24 even though I'm 30. I always end up back at Ulta getting another bottle. It's very moisturizing for how thin it applies to my face. I never feel greasy or like my skin can't breathe. I swear by this product... worth the money!I really like how this moisturizer makes my skin feel. Great to have high SPF the without it feeling heavy or sticky! No breakouts or irritation. It works well with the Dermalogica Intensive Moisture Cleanser and Daily Milkfoliant. I'm very happy with this product.I wish I could hate this because of the price but this is a great product. My skin is extremely sensitive and most facial sun screens make my face burn when I am in the sun, this one does not. It works great, goes on easy and doesn't bother my face.This moisturizer is truly great! I love that it saves me an extra step in my skincare routine with the SPF 50. I feel genuinely protected from the sun wearing it. I am someone with combination skin, dry, normal and oily areas, especially near my T zone and chin. I love how lightweight this feels on my skin compared to other SPF products, which feel overly thick and greasy. This moisturizer is very light and absorbs quickly, leaving a dewy look on the skin. The only things i dislike about this product are the smell. To me, it smells bad. It has a slight sunscreen smell, but theres another scent to it i cant quite place that im not a fan of. That, and i have to use several pumps to get it to cover my face and neck, so it seems like i have to use quite a bit of product at any given time. This wouldnt be an issue if the cost wasnt so high! I wish these products were more affordable because theyre amazing for sensitive skin. All in all, its a great product, and i will continue to use. I will definitelt be waiting for a sale before i buy again though.I have been using this moisturizer for 8 years! I love it! Like really love it. I am pretty loyal to dermalogica. This moisturizer is my go to everyday without miss. My skin is normal to oily in the t zone. I have never had a break out.I've used this product for a few years, and it lasted me awhile, but I just recently purchased again and it smells completely different!  It smells like sunscreen, which I get it has sunscreen in it, but it did not smell like it before.  I hate the smell of sunscreen, which is why I purchased it.  My makeup is also applying differently. I tried comparing ingredients but they're not listed on the back. Interesting!I love this product and have purchased it multiple times. It feels nice, it absorbs into my skin well without leaving a cast and without leaving a greasy feeling, and my makeup applies well on top of it. 11/10, will buy again when my current bottle is empty."

My face feels very hydrated after use and I have honestly seen a lot of improvement on lines around my neck! The product does feel a little thick applying, almost like a layer on top of your face if you use too much but that is my only complaint!Upgraded my skin care products and chose the perfect brand! This product only takes a very small amount and takes care of the face and neck. My only issue is it doesnt absorb quickly so I have to really rub it in. But after 1 day of morning and night use my skin is not red and patchy looking anymore. Very gentle on the skin and leaves my face feeling firm and tight!This stuff is fantastic!! I am pretty picky about my skincare products. I just bought my 3rd jar. It doesnt take much. The 1.7oz jar lasts two months, using it on face & neck. It almost comes to feel like a serum when it's being applied. 
Im coming up on being 50yrs-old this year, & this product is one of my Top 3 Favorite Moisturizers. I have dry skin & this moisturizer by itself makes my skin feel hydrated. 
It legitimately firms your face and neck, both. A few minutes after applying, you can pat/tap on your face & feel the results - skin that bounces back. Hexapeptide 8 (aka Argireline) is a great firming compound & it's listed toward the top. 
I use this day & night, & add over it a slightly heavier moisturizer for overnight. 

Try it!!I am not normally one to leave a review. But this product has exceeded all my expectations! I have very dry sensitive skin. From fall to summer it is tight, painful, and will even flake and crack. I have had some degree of pain on my face since October and it is now April. I went into ultra desperate for something that would help my dry painful skin that also was burnt from retinol. I was shown this as well as the Oasis serum. 
I can not tell you with one is better as I use them together. But within a few hours the pain was gone! Within 3 hours there was a visible difference in my skin and by the next morning it was a 180 degree turn around! It has been three days and each day I feel my fine lines and wrinkles are less viable swell as the redness and flaking are completely gone. I am a lifetime user now! I look forward to trying some of their other products as well.This one is full of peptides and the reason I purchased it.  It is perfect for me as a night time moisturizer and never feels too heavy but works wonders for my skin.smell is nice, felt really nice going on, but I've been using it a week and all the sudden I have all sorts of deep acne popping up, I've never had this problem before, and this is the only product in my routine that changedI have other things I use on my face - but I have recently been losing weight and my neck was getting all chick gullet-y. I swear by this. I am now ordering my 3rd jar of it. Smells great. No weird neck zits. I use it day and night and can't recommend it enough. Cannot vouch for it for the face. But it seems light so I may try it on my face soon."

This product is amazing, my skin feels so smooth and the product smells divine.This is truly a holy grail staple product in my kit! It's amazing for sensitive skin. Not only that it leaves the face with a subtle and hydrating glow for amazing makeup application or just by itself!I've been using the travel size as a primer and I enjoy it a lot so far. The formula smooths things out without drying the skin, and I only need a quarter-sized amount to cover my whole face. My only gripe is that it is really expensive. Plus, the scent is very strong. I don't mind the orange/citrus smell, but if that's a problem for you then i wouldnt recvomend because the scent is quite strong."

It is the best thing I've added to my regimen in a long time.The salesperson stated that the pineapple in this product should relieve the redness in my skin. This product created very red irritated skin follieing the third use. It took over a week to calm downNeeded a new moisturizer to try and was recommended this one. I used it and i was not a fan. I have used it for weeks, hoping that the use of it over time would help my skin. Instead, my skin feels worse, oily, and sticky. Every time i use it. Don't recommendI got thus product for free during one of my purchases, and let me just say, I am SOOO glad.
this was the first product I had from philosophy and I will be returning to buy this for myself and others â¡!
after getting this product I went and bought the mini exfoliating product they have and I pair those two together daily when I don't do my full routine:)
can't wait to try other products

Irritation,redness &dullness almost gone.This is a great moisturizer it leaves my skin hydrated, smooth and glowy it's gentle on the skin and doesn't have any added in fragrance.Should I do my serum, snail mucin and then the all in one cream, in my morning and night routine?I tried this product a few times, several months apart each. After each use I ended up with chemical burns on my face and neck. Do not buy this productI have been using this for almost a year and also repurchased as I have dryer skin naturally and this was very soothing. I have acne prone skin and this never causes breakouts, it's pretty neutral I feel like, so it won't cure acne but also will sooth your skin. I even feel like it's ""too moisturizing"" so wouldn't use on oily skin but I needed the hydration.My dad cursed me with his sensitive skin so I'm very selective on what I put on my face. This product is amazing for my acne-prone/texture skin and doesn't leave my face feeling tacky or red. For the size bottle you get it's not terribly priced either.It also wasn't super impressive. It was mid. It didn't cause acne / skin issues, but after 6 weeks of use i didn't feel improved them either"

If you have combination skin like me this wont be hydrating enoughI have very oily skin so was excited to try but it peels on me when I wear it alone or with sunscreenI have oily skin, i just bought this moisturizer have only used it twice. It is still early to tell if its working or not but I'm not sure how I feel about the moistureizer. It's definitely matte like it says. It almost feels drying to my face and doesn't feel hydrayting, but I'll see what happens.I decided to try this matte moisturizer after really loving the regular Double Repair version. The first week went well, but this week my face has been very itchy and uncomfortable. In fact, I just had to cleanse it off to get some relief. I'll still buy the non-matte formula, though.This La Roche-Posay Double Repair Matte Moisturizer supposedly provides comfortable hydration and helps reduce visible shine. And it does - then it pills. Its texture is lightweight and not too sticky. It makes my skin feel soft and look smooth. Then it pills. When I wear it with sunscreen, it pills. When I wear it with, or without, serums, it pills. Whether or not I exfoliate, it pills. When I wear it by itself, it pills. I literally just rest my cheek on my hand, and little shreds of moisturizer are left behind. There is something fundamentally wrong with the formulation of this moisturizer, which is very disappointing, because as I said, it does make my skin feel soft and look significantly less shiny. I won't continue to use it, and I don't recommend it to anyone else because of the pilling.I have very oily skin and have been on the hunt for a new skin care routine. I bought this about 5 days ago and use the face wash as well and my skin feels so much better and less oily. For those girlies who say they get a lot of peeling when they put makeup on should try water based makeup. It makes such a huge differsnce. I recommend this product and the face wash.Overall, I like this mositurizer. I can only use it at night because it pills up while I put on makeup. I have large pores that I'm trying to get under control, and this moisturizer is light and dewy. Absorbs quick."

I've tried everything to get rid of strawberry legs n old eczema bumps on the back of my arms and after about a week both are gone. 
the smell fades as soon as its dry N doesn't clash w/perfumeAHA works wonderfully effective but gentle for my dry and sensitive skin. This is my go to body lotion. A little sticky when first applied but in a while it gets absorbed into the skin. The smell is acceptable to me after long term use. I guess that is a price you pay for the results like any other effective ingredient. So happy Ulta is carrying my favorite body lotion now!!!Yes this does have a certain smell to it, but compared to how effective it is, ill deal with the smell. It disappears quickly. This has completely transformed my pre-teena acne covered back. I wish they made a face product as effective, but this is too strong to use on your face. HG product at our house.It amazing its been few weeks i had this big dark spot in my legs i been using this product its fading away.I have only used the product twice. I cannot yet say if it works, but the smell is not the greatest. It does not linger for very long on the body. I have eczema/dry skin. Again the smell is not favorable."

Not sure uf the formula changed or its just me but it definitely does not feel the same on my face as i remember. I remember being very hydrated and moisturized when i was given the facial, even the next day, whereas when i put this on, it feels like it disappears right away. On top of that, it is very scented like soa, which I don't like walking around and smelling my face all day. On top of that, as soon as i put on the moisturizer, it made my eyes feel the smallest sensation of burning a little bit. Will not be reourchasing again.This is my favorite dermalogica moisturizer! This is probably my favorite skin care brand!! Pricey but totally work it!This moisturizer is very hydrating. I do not think I will be using it though due to the smell, it smells horrible like mildew. If it smelled better I'd definitely recommend.These ingredients are amazing!!! I am 100% a fan. I have aging skin and after 5 nights of this in a row, I feel like I have a little glow! I already have been using their cleaner and love it, so this is a nice touch for after that. This was offered by dermalogica to review, and I'll be buying it again! FOR PRO COLLAGEN BANKING SERUMI have been using the Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Moisturizer for years. Its a great go to product for combination skin. It really does feel light weight and not greasy like some products I've used in the past. Recently, I was prescribed a retinol product, and my skin does appear a little drier than before which makes me think I'll probably move to the intense moisturizer, but prior to to use of the retinol this product was spot on for skin."

I have heard so many positive testimonials and read lots of reviews about Charlotte Tilbury magic cream and how wonderful it is. I wanted to try it out for myself. I was extremely impressed with how moisturizing and hydrating this silky smooth cream glides onto my face and quickly absorbs without making my face feel sticky or greasy. This gives a youthful glow to my skin without feeling or looking overly oily. This is a perfect base of moisture before my makeup routine. Charlotte Tilbury magic cream did not peel or make my sunscreen or makeup break down. I noticed that my skin looked firmer around my eyes and forehead after applying. I love how my skin feels like satin so soft after using. I'll most definitely will purchase a full size.Every Charlotte Tilbury product I have tried has been amazing.   The fragrance and feel of this moisturizer is perfect.I love the way this moisturizer feels.  It hydrates without feeling greasy.It feels great going on but it does nothing but break out my skin. My skin is moisturized right after but it doesn't stay. Too expensive for what it is for sureThis is expensive and I often find things I like at more reasonable prices but this is worth it. I use this with matte NARS foundation. And the combination is perfect, it doesn't  look too dry because my skin is moisturized but it doesnt move around and crease because it isnt greasyAfter receiving a deluxe and with low expectations, I was blown away with the results.

Next step should be a discount for auto replenishment customersâ¦I've been using this cream exclusively for the last year and can't go without it. I'm in my forties and get compliments on my skin all the time. I don't really have lines or wrinkles, but this keeps my face smooth and firm. The only con would be that it's heavily scented. I don't have sensitive skin, but can see the fragrance being an issue for those that do. Fantastic cream, though, and worth every penny.Must be loaded with fragrance as my eyes were totally fogged by cream, even just on forehead.

It is thick, occlusive, and helps heal the area over time. Great to use around the nose too for cold/flu/allergy season.I actually like this product. This was my first time buying it, and I was really freaked out by all the water that squirts out every time I used it. When I saw a few reviews here that mentioned it, I decided to use it anyway. Makes my skin feel very nice while using a retinoid, but it is super thick and greasy (probably moreso than formulators intended since so much water has come out of emulsion) so I only use it at night. I'm definitely concerned that the product is damaged or compromised.I have battled constant flair-ups of perioral dermatitis and rosacea for years. I have taken so many prescription antibiotics and creams. Nothing ever helped. Not one time did a doctor ever say, ""Let's work to get your skin barrier repaired because it's so damaged that this cycle is just going to keep repeating itself."" I came across this product from a TikTok video and decided to give it a try. Within ONE WEEK, my skin cleared up,  and I haven't had a reoccurrence in a month. My skin looks better than it has in years.Just like many other people here, this product is truly a holy grail. Particularly for my perioral dermatitis, which had been getting much worse recently with the change in weather. 

Also like others, my tube initially came with some watery excess when first opened. I scoured the internet to find a solution and found out that if you place the tube in a hot glass/bowl of water, the product will completely melt and resolidify WITHOUT any excess water. Before you send it back, I would try this. This product it 100% my new favorite and now I dont need to worry about the first day wateriness!!I got a sample if this product direct from avene when I purchased something from them thats not available at ulta. I loved it so I figured I would pick up a full size when i went to ulta today. Opened it up and super watery. So while i love the product something about what is in stock currently seems to be off. I recommend opening it up after buying but before leaving the store just to be safe.Upon covid erupting in 2019, somehow that same year i developed really bad perioral dermatitis. I had to have gone through at least 5 skin care routines before finally finding this brand. I use this and their moisturizer every single day and I havent had a flare up since! Granted i also swapped my toothpaste containing SLS too, but this cream saved my life. Its watery when first opened, and seems really messy, but eventually the product settles and works just fine. If you have dermatis, try this!I was really excited to use this product but when i opened it a lot of water came out. I tried shaking it but majority of the product is water. Super disappointed."

I have pretty sensitive skin, and it hasnt broken me out at all.I really like the texture of this cream, it feels very smooth. It is thick so its easy to put on too much.

Always liked their daily moisturizer but i have oily skin so it didn't help, but this oil control moisturizer helps a lot. My skin doesn't look as shiny. Perfect product for summer. It is not heavy at all.In my search for an oil-free moisturizer this was recommended. I used this for a month and loved it. No breakouts, controlled my oily skin and seemed to work really well. So, I stocked up and got more. I noticed something was different after the 3rd use of the new jar. I started breaking out. I haven't broken out in almost 3 years. I was confused and continued to use it because why would it start breaking me out now? I loved the first jar. I'm not sure if the formula changed or if my skin is just being finicky. 

Overall, I recommend the product because it seems to be very good. It's a struggle for us oily girls to find products that offer us a balance of hydration while keeping oil at bay. I hope it works for you if you try it :)Ever since Neutrogena discontinued their Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin - my holy grail of moisturizers - I have been desperately searching for a replacement that will keep my breakouts under control without over-drying my skin. The search is finally over - this is it!! My skin starting clearing up and looking healthier after the first overnight application! I've now been using it for 2 months and it's continued to significantly reduce my breakouts (in frequency and duration) without drying out my skin. The only downside is that the container is about half the size I was assuming it would be, based on other FAB products I've purchased. (Although that's on me for not looking at the size printed on the front of the product.) Each container lasts me a little over 2 months with one application per day on my face and sometimes neck and/or chest. Honestly though I'm in love.Ive used this product for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin and have used several different face moisturizers over the years and this is the only one that keeps my face from getting super shiny by the end of the day, even with serums underneath it. It WORKS so to me its worth every penny!This is the best moisturizer I have ever found for my oily skin! I have an oily t-zone and this keeps my skin from becoming oily all day. I worked an 8-hour shift wearing this and when I got home my forehead was still dry, but not peeling, it just felt finally normal. I use this on my entire face, but keep in mind you can use it only in certain areas that you struggle with oil, so don't let other reviews about dry skin deter you. With winter coming up I may begin to only use this on my oily areas and another moisturizer on others, but this is literally the holy grail moisturizer for anyone struggling with oily skin.I have combination skin and this has saved my skin texture and made it so soft. The consistency feels so nice and it's not overly drying even in my dry areas. Feel like it's reduced some redness as well.If you have oily skin this paired with the Oil and Pore Control Mattifier Broad Spectrum SPF 45 PA++++ works miracles. I started using it as a combo a couple of months ago and when I tell you My skin has never been better. I would produce so much oil that i wouldn't last an hour before i was an oil mess but using the moisturizer with the spf has helped so much i go through out the day with pretty fresh looking skin. Totally recomend!!!!!!"

I have had reactions to it but i also have used it for months on end and lived the results. you may be thinking ""oh she must have gotten different bottles over time ans had different results"". no. same bottle. ACTUALLY this is one of my biggest pros. Ive had this same bottle since CHRISTMAS ans just rand out in may. i don't use a full pump and it is plenty for all my skin and my neck!! (i have the regular sized container!) 

Now to be clear i have had adverse reactions, red hot face and uncomfortable skin feel. but i have found this only happens TO ME if i use it fresh outa the shower. so now i used a different moisturizer out of the shower and this one i used as part of my daytime routine and it works perfectly!! 

So all to sum this review up, know your skin. try again as long as you aren't genuinely allergic and listen to you bodys indications!! thank you!This stuff is a scam. The crazy blonde lady that helped me in ulta scammed me with the yuka app and then forced me to buy it. She saw my mom buying an eye cream and she forced her to buy a beekman one we both hate the brand and the products and we will never shop at ulta againHoly cow. Got this as a sample. Put it on and thought it had a minty cool feel on my skin. About five minutes later i looked in the mirror and looked like i was getting a chemical peel. I use samples all of rhe time. Dont recall having such a reaction. Won't recommend.I am over fifty and I use this as my moisturizer.  Even other sensitive skin moisturizers left me with breakouts. I hate the bottle though. The bloom either leaves me with too much moisturizer or not enough.

48,48,48,beautycounter,countercontrol matte effect gel cream,pimprod2038172,2606559,"If you truly have oily skin, you know the difference in a review from someone with oily skin vs someone whos skin gets oily.  I have oily skin and probably spend upwards of $1K a year on products trying to find things that actually do as they claim, and this is one of them.

I was a little reluctant to purchase this as the price is pretty high for a brand I've never used, but I'm glad that I took the risk on it.  Prior to this moisturizer I was either using none at all (because most others just make me more oily, dont need redundant products on oily skin), or I was using the La-Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Matte one which didn't do much for me. Obviously how this will work for you is going to be different for everyone, and the other products you use prior to your moisturizer will make a difference as well.

For reference I am a 28 yr old female, white/Caucasian.  My morning routine is: wash with a clay based cleanser (Dermalogica), tone (Fenty Skin), hyperpigmentation serum (Good Molecules), niacinamide/zinc serum (Sunday Riley), then this moisturizer. The consistency of this product is great for oil as it is a gel based product, but it comes out more opaque white than clear which is fine. It does not have much of a fragrance that I have noticed, but I'm not sensitive to fragrance so I wouldn't be one to say. When I put this on it almost feels as if it is a crossover between a moisturizer and a makeup primer that blurs your pores.  Now it does not make your pores go away by any means, but it does HELP.  Immediately after applying my skin is definitely mattified but again, not completely shine free as if it is a primer with the sole purpose of making your skin look like it has powder on it. It does not make my skin feel tight and dried out, it genuinely makes me feel moisturized and smooth without the glowy look that normal moisturizers do. From my experience it definitely does not keep me matte for 8 hours, I would say after about 3-4 hours I start to see shine on my face to the point where I feel the need to blot if I were going out somewhere (this is all without wearing makeup or anything on top of my morning skin routine, I work from home).

If you truly have an oily/combo skin type this is not going to be your holy-grail product that makes all of your problems disappear (will continue to search for it), but if it is within your budget for a product of this type then this is 100% top 5 best moisturizers for oily skin on the market right now in my opinion after having used this for a few weeks now.  Would repurchase (and I rarely ever find products I do)!  

I also just want to throw out there that I did buy this on my own, was not asked/paid to write this, and I think this is either my only review I've ever written on Ulta or one of a few over a span of years that I don't even remember.The packaging is very luxe but the pump feels like its empty and its still half full. It doesn't mattify anything but it is a nice mix of a gel and lotion and a lightweight moisturizer. This is an MLM and I do feel it's overpriced for what it is. It's pretty basic.Matte effect that works great as a moisturizer/ primer for oily skin types"

For years I was using  drugstore moisturizers that would leave me greasy, shiny, and give me clogged pores. When I switched to this moisturizer about 5 months ago, I was very scared my skin would go through purging. To my surprise this product had a great affect in my daily skincare regimen. I use this once in the morning and once at night, and it does not clog my pores or cause any acne! The only downside is this is a VERY lightweight product and during the winter it isn't always enough to soothe my dry skin. But with someone who has oily skin during summer months, this is perfect! There is also a lot of product in the bottle as well, and has a very nice light scent to it.I have very dry skin and have been trying to change my mosturizer so I decided to buy this, I sadly did not like it because it wasn't hydrating enough. So if you have very dry skin, this product may not work.I got this as a free sample with my purchase so I tried it that night along with The Ordinary niacinamide, didn't wake up with any break outs which to me is a win. I'm even more hormonal than usual this week iykyk which was even more amazing. I've been looking for a good simple day moisturizer and this definitely hit the spot. Reasonably priced for how much you get as well.I like this moisturizer alot. Good for the price and how much you get in the tube. I just wish they had a SPF version or a more moisturizing version for at night. But this is perfect for everything. Will buy again!it moisturizes well but i can like feel it on my face after it has a bit of a cooling effect but not in a good way i can feel it on my skin when i move my face. and a little goes a LONG way. i won it in a giveaway so im gonna use it all but i wouldnt buy it with my own money.Im more of a gel moisturizer person however this moisturizer works well! It isnt heavy and hydrates my skin perfectlyI have not ever been able to use creams or anything on my dÃ©colletÃ© area ever(I'm 49). My girl Kira (Ulta Estetition) showed me this brand. Amazingly it not only doesnt cause a rash, it has kept me from getting rashes. I can also use it when neck acts up from a past retinol burn. Love this product and love this brand!"

It has a greasy feeling and feels like it sits on top of the skin. I tried it 2 or 3 more times but the moisturizer migrates into my eyes and it burned my eyes pretty bad. Not a fan, I'll keep it to use for my neck/chest but not my face.This was the drink I needed for my skin this winter. IDK? why it has such a low * raiting? It soaked in amazingly and it feels smooth, practically facial cream.. It worked in as little as 2 days my skin plumped up No more dry patches. I will always have this on hand, and Of course it's clinique So, you know it won't burn or break you out! I highly recommend this product for people that have dry skin and wanna look refreshed & plumped again!! â¡Got this as a gift its really hydrating but almost too much it made me incredibly greasy definitely shouldnt be used as everyday moisturizer and more just as a trearmentthe product is greatCreamy.

This is defiantly it, it is not to oily either. Especially in the winter when my skin tends to need a little extra moisture. My boyfriend also uses this and absolutely love its.I have combo skin, and was on a hunt for a new moisturizer. After reading the reviews on this one, I decided to give it a try. I have used it for around a week now, and will be returning it. It sat heavy on my skin, and never would fully absorb. It made me look at feel greasy, and it pilled pretty badly.I'm usually a budget skincare girlie but I got a sample of this and have kept repurchasing. I love this on my skin at night. I use benzoyl peroxide and retinol and this still is able to keep my skin hydrated.Why change a good thing?? I used Aqua Bomb for years it was my holy grail moisturizer, never got greasy from it and it was so refreshing to use. They recently reformulated this product adding niacinimide, and the hydration is supposed to be ""longer lasting."" The only long lasting thing about it is the grease-ball effect I get after 8 hours of wear and little comedomes to round out the look. Bring back the original formula please!New formulation has changed this product away from why I originally liked it (had been using for nearly a decade). 

If you need an occlusive (sealing layer moisturizer) thats oiky skin friendly - this might be a good try 

It dries down with a thin smoothing silicone layer that sits on the skin and seals in products underneath 

WHAT CHANGED- does not feel as deeply hydrating / plumping, or skin calming. I had used prviously formulation as a deeply hydrating night moisturizer with great results; woke up with reduced fine lines, redness on skin resuced, more even complexion.   Now this is nothing special.I have combination skin and this has been my go to for YEARS. Its the only thing that deeply moisturizes my skin, doesnt cause breakouts, and it reasonably priced. This can withstand the most humid and coldest climates.I got this as a sample and I will definitely be buying more. Its silky smooth and makes my skin feel so soft. Its not greasy and it doesnt irritate my skin. Probably one of my fave facial moisturizers."

I assumed this would be the same especially since its a sunscreen moisturizer combo. However I was wrong!  The texture and finish is so so lovely. It's very lightweight and glides on nicely, moisturizes without leaving me feeling like a shiny greasy mess! It's perfect under make too. Highly recommend!It is weightless but it burns yours eyes terribly when you go to take it off ...and it's not sweat proof...for the almost $50 this is I expect more out of a spf moisturizer. There are drugstore brands that can offer the same for a way less price point. Definitely returning.For some reason, every other facial sunscreen I've tried either made my face red and hot, had a sticky texture, or made my skin bumpy and textured afterwards. This is the only sunscreen without any of these issues! It feels like a regular, lightweight moisturizer in every way, and washes off easily without any texture or stickiness.I love this moisturizer! it's super lightweight and there's no strong spf smell. it doesn't feel like i'm wearing anything and it doesn't break me out at all (like most sunscreens normally do)Unfortunately this is a miss for me. The texture is that of a mild moisturizer, which is great, but the chemical filters in this sunscreen leave a lot to be desired. It has a sunscreen smell that lingers, and also stings my eyes.The formula was a bit thick and strong smelling for my liking. For moisturizers, I need a thinner formula or else I get greasy really easily as someone with oily skin. In addition, I use the supergoop sunscreen and I feel like that provides a better base to prep my skin than this.I have dry skin, and I look for products that are super hydrating. This moisturizer is super lightweight, but gets the job done, and the fact that it has SPF makes it even better.  The hyaluronic acid gives my skin the hydration it needs!

This is definitely not for sensitive skin with all of the highly fragrant ingredients in it. I thought my face was purging but after two months, I couldnt take it anymore. Its been 3 months sonce stopping and im still trying to recover from the skin damage it caused. Not all skin types are alike but I think less basic skin care is probably best. The eye balm is nice and works with awaking but I also think it made my dark circles worse.My favorite is the so polished exfoliating scrub, but all of the products complement each other. I look forward to washing my face now!I have only used the moisturizer and toner so far but I love them both. The toner doesn't irritate my skin and the moisturizer does a great job without making my skin oilySo far, so good!I bought this set for my preteen daughter to help her establish a good skin care routine!

I have sensitive skin and I am also very careful with certain ingredients I use on my skin. This is the best moisturizer, it's hydrating but not greasy and great for day or night. I just mix it with my sunscreen in the morning.I wanted to love this moisturizer because its clean- I didn't even mind the smell even though some complain about it. But I noticed after several weeks of use, I had many blackheads on my nose and chin. I didn't realize it wasn't non-comedogenic so that was on me for not paying attention. If you have acne or get breakouts, I wouldn't recommend this.I wish the people who get the products for FREE other wise known as influencers would just be honest. I found it no big deal I've used other products for alot less money, but the 5 â­ crews won't be getting free stuff if they don't give a high score. Wait a few weeks to buy it and if you don't like return it, so this is an HONEST review.Love it!!I highly recommend this! I kept finding moisturizers that either broke me out or pilled on my face (deal breaker). This one does neither and keeps my face moisturized. It is on the pricey side, but I bought it on sale. The only thing I don't love is the smell. At first it just smells like nothing, but once I rub it in it's almost a chemical smell? Not sure, but I'll take that over not breaking me out.It goes on like silk and makes your face feel soft and smooth. Feels good after I put on my toner and serums and then it's like a nice after finish. Good smell. Overall the best moisturizer I've used. Somewhere between a gel and a creamOh my, this product literally STINKS! Unimpressed and just couldn't get past the smell. Not sure why it does but I definitely don't want it on my face."

I have somewhat dry skin that is sensitive and if I use too heavy of a moisturizer I can get those pesky white little balls of grease or bumps. But if I use a very lightweight lotion, it doesn't do enough for my face. So it's always been hard to find the right combination of moisture that it not too heavy. This has a wonderful mild scent, the texture of the cream itself is fabulous and feels luxurious when you use it. It sinks into your skin without leaving it feeling greasy and it has great ingredients too, plus comes in a glass jar. I do wish it was more of a pump or something I didn't have to use my fingers with but it's still totally worth it for me. I am 51 so I am not sure how much it is helping with wrinkles but I think it keeps my skin in great condition and I recommend you try it if you have problems finding the right moisturizer like I did!leaves my skin super soft and a perfect bouncy yet firm feel to it, has been an absolute game changer for my skincare routineI've got sensitive, oily/combo skin and nothing has impressed me more than this moisturizer! I just bought my second one and don't think I can ever live without it now! It does not leave a greasy residue whatsoever, smells and feels amazing!even though there's a scent I can't smell it and it doesn't break me out !!

I seen influencers use so much product but I seriously use one pump and thats enough. Wears well under makeup as well as the LaRochePosay spf. I highly recommend. The ingredients alone are phenomenal!This moisturizer leaves the skin glowy and plump looking exactly as advertised! If you don't already have oily skin it may feel a little too lightweight; I have acne-prone combo skin and find myself wishing it were SLIGHTLY more hydrating however it hasn't caused any more acne or sensitivity and seems to agree with my skin. On days where I feel extra dry I've been applying a thicker moisturizer on top and I haven't noticed any pilling.I love this moisturizer. I hate the bottle it comes in. I can appreciate some beefy, luxe-feelin' packaging as much as the next guy, but this heavy, thick glass bottle makes it a stupid hassle to use the second 50% of the product inside it. I don't need my ultra-lightweight moisturizer to come in a bottle so hefty and chunky that it would make the best choice for an improvised weapon of any product in my daily skincare routine.I have been looking for a good lightweight moisturizer. Ive never tried peach and lilly before but let me tell you this is it! My moisturizer before had left a bit of a film after applying. And my skin would be dry by the end of the day.

My skin looks more plump and smooth. I'm 40 years old and was shockingly called ""young lady"" today at the store. Only downside is that this is expensive so I will wait for coupons/sales in order to repurchase.Love the product.  It helps fight the dryness of my skin, and it feels wonderful going on.I have spent years and a fortune searching for a moisturizer that would help my dry skin. Nothing worked until I found this!!  It may seem a little pricey but it actually works and it lasts a long time. One pump is enough to cover my face and neck. I won't do without this and hope they don't change the formula or discontinue it!!This is an excellent cream to use during the harsh winter months in Chicago. My skin looks and feels so hydrated! Also love that it dispenses the correct amount to ise on your face!Love Dermalogica, but this is a huge miss. Very thick and sticky - it's like putting heavy sunscreen on your face. You can't put this on then go straight to bed as your face sticks to your pillow. This stickiness also feels itchy. So many other great Dermalogica products that feel much nicer on the skin and do a great jobI got this product on sale for the yearly (or bi-yearly?) ""love your skin"" sale. I've recently started using it and was amazed at how well it hydrates my skin and keeps my face from peeling after using tretnoin. I highly recommend it.Dont get me wrong its a good moisturizer but it did irritate my skin. I will not repurchase. I personally dont think it is worth the price at all. Youre better off buying a more affordable moisturizer but if you have the money then go for it. Dont forget its not the bestð"

For reference I'm 30 and have always had extremely OILY skin. They say you still have to moisturize even when you have oily skin so I began using this at night. This cream is so soft and easy to use over top of any other serums, eye creams, etc. I wake up and my skin is glowy and healthy. My breakouts arw pretty much non existent at this point. My acne scars are less promient and my skin looks so much better under my makeup and the makeup applies so much smoother. I use this with Peach and Lily Lactic Acid Serum and the Oasis serum and this routine is amazing. My oil production has balanced out so well, and I dont get as shiny throughout the day anymore! I am obssessed! Highly recommend!I love this. It gives me 100 hours of moisture no lie! I use in the PM. My face feels so smooth and plump in the AM. It's great over makeup.I love this. It gives me 100 hours of moisture no lie! I use in the PM. My face feels so smooth and plump in the AM. It's great over makeup.I'm so happy they made a moisturer that's more rich for dry skin. It's still very light like the other products but I've noticed the difference in my skin, it feels more hydrated.I purchased this along with the lactic acid serum BY Peach & Lily - combined they are just absolutely wonderful!  I have combination skin (more oily on my t-zone) and I have extremely finicky skin (when it comes to using certain products it tends top make me breakout) - but, not with these products.  I've been using them for about a week now and already see results.  I wake up to the most softest , hydrated skin!  The lactic acid serum definitely reduced my fine lines and my skin does feel more taught.I usually use the glass skin moisturizer but noticed my face was getting a little dry. This does so well for my dry skin & isnt too heavyI have combination skin, but my skin has been extremely dry recently due to the Midwest cold air and my use of retinoids. This cream is INSANELY hydrating and feels amazing on the skin. It's not too thick, at least for me. I have primarily been using this at night, and I wake up in the morning and my skin is still very much hydrated."

The reviews are correct, will start to pill horriblyI saw this recommended by a dermatologist for dry skin. This is useless cream that provides no moisture at all. Ibhave used twice a day for a week and my skin is so dry and flaky. I had high hopes, but very disappointed, even on the skin when you first apply it feels dry and night. No piling with makeup. I hesitate to try any other products.I have eczema, and have been searching for a moisturizer that effectively moisturizes & doesn't irriate my skin. This moisturizer burns my skin, and does not leave it feeling hydrated. I was under the impression that La Roche-Posay was for sensative skin, but this made my skin feel worse. Will not purchase again.This has been my go-to moisturizer for years! It's perfect for my sensitive skin, has a great texture (not too thin or too thick), and makes me so glowy. I use it year round â it's lightweight enough for summer yet hydrating enough for winter!Sadly I wish I throughly went through all the reviews before purchasing. This moisturizer goes on nicely, however once dry it crumbles and balls up in the skin.I wanted to love this but this moisturizer pills so badly"

I love the way it moisturizes and doesn't leave a greasy feel. Skin on my face feels so soft all day long. Had to buy a full size and now the gift one is in my travel bag.My mother bought this product and I noticed it had a strong fragrance to it. Now I'm not a dermatologist, but I have enough knowledge to know that anything fragrance is horrible for your skin. Anyway, my skin broke out in hives when I tried this product, along with acne. Please don't buy skincare from Lancome, it's not the best for most people.I love how this looks on my skin! It's matte but hydrating. Happy that it has hyaluronic acid as well. My makeup looks so good now! I used to use tatcha but didn't like oily it made my skin look. This will now be my go to!I have normal to dry skin, but a lot of moisturizers will clog my pores if i sleep in them. I just stopped wearing a mositurizer to bed altogether for a while for this reason. When I saw the ingredients in this I became curious and decided to give it a try. My skin is so hydrated and looks beautiful in the morning! Also, if i develop a blemish during the day, I will still slap this moisturizer on top of it at night and not only does it not make it worse, it actually heals it and my skin clears up so much faster!

For years I was using  drugstore moisturizers that would leave me greasy, shiny, and give me clogged pores. When I switched to this moisturizer about 5 months ago, I was very scared my skin would go through purging. To my surprise this product had a great affect in my daily skincare regimen. I use this once in the morning and once at night, and it does not clog my pores or cause any acne! The only downside is this is a VERY lightweight product and during the winter it isn't always enough to soothe my dry skin. But with someone who has oily skin during summer months, this is perfect! There is also a lot of product in the bottle as well, and has a very nice light scent to it.I have very dry skin and have been trying to change my mosturizer so I decided to buy this, I sadly did not like it because it wasn't hydrating enough. So if you have very dry skin, this product may not work.I got this as a free sample with my purchase so I tried it that night along with The Ordinary niacinamide, didn't wake up with any break outs which to me is a win. I'm even more hormonal than usual this week iykyk which was even more amazing. I've been looking for a good simple day moisturizer and this definitely hit the spot. Reasonably priced for how much you get as well.I like this moisturizer alot. Good for the price and how much you get in the tube. I just wish they had a SPF version or a more moisturizing version for at night. But this is perfect for everything. Will buy again!it moisturizes well but i can like feel it on my face after it has a bit of a cooling effect but not in a good way i can feel it on my skin when i move my face. and a little goes a LONG way. i won it in a giveaway so im gonna use it all but i wouldnt buy it with my own money.Im more of a gel moisturizer person however this moisturizer works well! It isnt heavy and hydrates my skin perfectlyI have not ever been able to use creams or anything on my dÃ©colletÃ© area ever(I'm 49). My girl Kira (Ulta Estetition) showed me this brand. Amazingly it not only doesnt cause a rash, it has kept me from getting rashes. I can also use it when neck acts up from a past retinol burn. Love this product and love this brand!"

I've since discontinued the product and have not had a breakout in 3 weeks. it was moisturizing and I also love the gel one. the cream may be too heavy for me, Im unsure.My skin is breaking out and itchy and burning.

Issue is, after a while of daily use, my skin would feel dry; even patchy.

The outside jar is much bigger than the actual inside pot that holds the product. Seems dishonest.This cream is magic in a bottle. My skin feels more hydrated, firmed, and my fine lines have minimized. Buying a backup now!!I can't yet speak to long term results but the immediate results are great so far. cream is light and fully absorbs in about 15 minutes. Skin is left soft smooth and natural not shiny or oily.  skin tone looks evened, pores blurred. lines are plumper and nasolabial folds appear firmed.

I used it night cream the first night I got it and woke up and washed my face and placed on the day cream. Moments afterward my face began to feel very itchy and uncomfortable. If I would itch it would leave scratch welts all over my face (what it looks like when a dog jumps up and scratches you is the best way to describe it), followed by an itchy sensation from my head to my toes. Once I would itch I would get little hive bumps and the scratch welts all over my body. Very sad this product did not work out for me, but wanted to warn others that have sensitive skin.This moisturizer is very thick and seems to be a great product with the exception of the smell. It is a vibrant apple/lemon like a candy. 
Reminds me of a teenage type product, unfortunately it is to potent to use at night, to try to fall asleep it just keeps me up.I love both the day and night moisturizer. The day is light and great under makeup, the night is thicker and really hydrates my skin. They also smell great!I had such high hopes for this product, but so far I am not as impressed as i hoped I would be. The price is kinda high to be honest, for the amount of product you get! I do love that it is natural ingredients. The fragrance was so strong though which was unexpected. It smells like lemongrass oil or a lemon head candy. Im not really a fan as i prefer light to no scent in my skincare products. Also it is way heavier of a formula than i was expecting, so I had to use a good bit of product to cover my whole face and neck area. And i feel like it just sits on the surface of my skin. The Daytime lotion was just as thick and hard to spread as the nighttime formula. I am not sure if i want to keep it or return it ð Don't really love it, or hate it it is just Okay.Absolutely love Juice Beauty skincare. I can't say the same about their makeup, but these moisturizers are a win! The scent probably isn't for everyoneâ¦ I've gotten used to it, but didn't love it right away. Very happy with the product performance, though.This product is the real deal. 100% worth the price. My skin is tighter and it glows! I've gotten so many compliments the last few months. Real results! Highly recommend.This is a decent product, but very pricey considering a full size is less than 2 oz (1.7 oz)!  Read the fine print; you cannot tell from the advertising that the containers are only 1/3 actual product.

I highly recommend giving it a try!Definitely love how thick it is, and creamy. But the downfall is for the priceâ¦ the cream should not peel on your skin after it dries. And smells heavily of roses. But it is a nice scent.For the price of this moisturizer it should not be pilling ðI am shocked by how well it works for my combo leaning towards oily skin! Hydrating but not greasy. Very highly recommend!The key with this moisturizer is WATER. I spray my face with Evian water after applying and rub it in. I swear this stuff will keep your face hydrated ALL DAY. I buy it over and over again.not a fan, the scent doesn't bother me, I like it and it doesn't bother my skin. what does bother me is that this pills up with my serums and even when I use the rose serum with the moisturizer it pills up so even using the same product line doesn't prevent it. 
thankfully I got this half off because it's totally not worth it imo.I usually love Fresh, and this toner & mousturizing cream felt wonderful on my skin. Until Mount Vesuvius happened on my forehead overnight. I've never had a zit or acne but suddenly my skin thinks it's 14 and bumping out! It is really too bad im allergic or it's highly comedogenic.

Goes on smoothly, not sticky and doesnt leave a white cast. It gave a me a bit of dewy look with the greasy shine.I love the product, I will purchase again this is my first time ever using sunscreen and I am so happy with the results a little pricey but it's worth it.It's a little earlier to say whether this is an awesome product. However, the Lancome fella was so knowledgeable and personable. I do wish it was a little thinner to make spreading easier.First of all, its such a tiny tube. It didnt apply as smoothly as I hoped. It is very rich, possibly a little to rich for my skin. I think i need something a little lighter so will most likely be returning this.I love this sunscreen primer so much! I have yet to find anything better and I've tried a lot of moisturizers with sunscreen. The only downside is the size of the tube.

This sunscreen has an odd smell to it.I've had such a hard time finding a face sunscreen that didnt mess with my skin or makeup and this is it! I'm obsessed with how easy it is to apply after my skincare and it was no issue at all with my makeup after application! It doesn't have a typical sunscreen smell.

I bought this on a whim and I'm so glad that I did! I use it everyday either on its own or under my makeup. I have light, sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. This product blends well over my other skincare and doesn't feel heavy. Its also beautiful under makeup. I'll keep repurchasing.Took me a bit to get used to this product esp after using city block spf 40, but is now a staple in my everyday morning routine.

I've tried everything to get rid of strawberry legs n old eczema bumps on the back of my arms and after about a week both are gone.

A little sticky when first applied but in a while it gets absorbed into the skin. The smell is acceptable to me after long term use. I guess that is a price you pay for the results like any other effective ingredient. So happy Ulta is carrying my favorite body lotion now!!!Yes this does have a certain smell to it, but compared to how effective it is, ill deal with the smell. It disappears quickly. This has completely transformed my pre-teena acne covered back. I wish they made a face product as effective, but this is too strong to use on your face. HG product at our house.It amazing its been few weeks i had this big dark spot in my legs i been using this product its fading away.I have only used the product twice.

First off I really like that SR is clean & cruelty free. I like that this cream comes in a glass jar, the smell is pleasant enough and the texture is so light, airy like mousse. I used this for 6 weeks and here is what I found. For day use after application I tried 2 different primers and they both pilled. Tried  w/o primer with 3 different brands of tinted moisturizers with SPF and it still pilled. So I could not use it for day. So using this for 6 weeks at night I personally did not see any of the promised results. It didn't bother my skin at all but then again my skin is not sensitive, I am over 55 too if that helps.   Glad others love this just not for me.This is an amaizng product! A little bit goes a long way also! I'm highly impressive quality and how nice my skin feels afterwards!Please spot test this if you have sensitive skin. I did a spot test behind one ear and had a reaction. It actually burned my skin. Its been 4 weeks and the area begind my ear is still irritated. May have worked for others but not me.Nice glow under make up.Purchased during an Ulta sale. I usually love Sunday Riley products, but was very surprised by this. This causes extreme pilling. To test that it was this and not some combination of products, I tried it in the morning with zero other products on my skin after washing my face. I did not put any other products on top of it. Rather than absorbing, it sits on top of the skin and pills and comes off if you touch your face!! Makes me feel very dirty. I truly do not understand the good reviews. The smell is strong (neroli), but that doesn't bother me.I use this in the mornings and can tell my face is more hydrated. I typically have reactions to vitamin C, and I have not noticed any breakouts or dry patches. I read complaints about the smell: it isn't fragrant,  just smells like turmeric.I was recently introduced to this brand from my birthday gift in March and I cannot get enough of there products! The afterglow  brightening cream is exactly what it says , your skin is hydrated and refreshed and glowing ! It has a scent but it is not overpowering at all . 
I will continue to try sunday riley products because so far I've fell in love with every one I've tried !!!"

As soon as I tried this a couple years ago, I immediately knew I would love it. I've tried to find cheaper alternatives and even another high-end brand, but I always regret it and can't wait to repurchase this one. It works really well under makeup and doesn't make my face feel greasy. As much as I've tried, I can't let go of this moisturizer!This moisturizer is the best I have ever used. My skin is so soft and smooth. The best part is how good it is under makeup. It gives my foundation a flawless finish. It truly is the best I have ever used and I am 54.I've used Tatcha, Dior, La Mer and those doesn't compare to how amazing this moisturizer makes my skin look and feel.!This is the best cream in the world. It has magical powers I swear. It has healed my skin, and my friends skin. If you have dry skin this needs to be in your routine. It is not cheap, which is the only con. But if you were to splurge on anything this is THE product. I have tried many moisturizers and nothing compares. It is creamy, but lightweight. It is not greasy and absorbs quickly. It cures dry skin, no exaggeration. Don't even think about it just get it.I've used this moisturizer daily for 8 years at night and nothing else holds up to the southwest's dry climate. No matter what other moisturizer I try (high end, drugstore, Korean skincareâ¦doesn't matter) I always end up coming back to this one.

After 2 weeks i am already seeing an improvement. The skin on my nexknis softer but more importantly it is helping with my wrinkles and crepey skin! I will finish the trial size and buy more if it keeps up! For anyone using remember that a little goes a long way so if it feels to thick or sticky use less when applying.Genuinely this is the first moisturizer that has actually plumped my fine lines"

I would only recommend this for a retinol beginner.The best cream ever that i have used!!I never break out but after using this product for a week I started getting cystic acne. I had to stop using it. It smells great though, absorbed quickly and made my skin feel very soft.A little goes a long way. After using once a day for about a week, and realized, ""Hey! My deep lines have melted away, and sl many pores just clean and clear as opposed to before using it.  I will never be without it if I can mange it. Great value, and smooth, clear, calm skin.It has taken a minute and definitely need to moisturize more but seeing smoother skin!!!love this moisturizer w/serum. So gentle, yet very effective."

It also pills WITH other cerave products which shocked me.I have tried so many face moisturizers and they are always heavy feeling on my face and i live in Florida and i usually feel a layer of sweat beads. This moisturizer doesnt feel like that and my face feels soft! This is my new favorite moisturizer for sure!I bought this and a la roche posay one- this one wins! It doesnt pill under makeup, its lightweight, and doesnt smell at all. I dont think its oil free based on the packaging, but it doesnt feel oily. I switched from the cream tub for the winter weather and to this for summer with the humidity and oiliness. I like the lid as well as it stands up in my medicine cabindtI have very oily skin, especially in my T zone. I love this. Ive been using it for about 1 year now currently on my second bottle. Its very light and doesnt leave my skin feeling full of oil throughout the day.I've been using this moisturizer daily for months now. It doesn't leave residue or a sticky feeling on my skin. The packaging is also great. We've all had to cut the ends off of our products in tubes to get out every last bit. That is NOT the case with this one. Mine is VERY near empty and the product is still coming out with the pump!I have spent soooo much money on a moisturizer for my oily skin. I tried this product and I am hooked!! it's soooo good!!! I highly recommend!!!I usually love gel moisturizers for my sensitive and acne prone combo skin but unfortunately this one left me disappointed. The consistency was nice immediately upon application, but within minutes my face felt super dry as if I hadn't applied a moisturizer at all. It certainly does ""absorb quickly"" as it promises. However I'd expect my skin to be left at least a little hydrated after absorption. I'll give it a star for being non irritating at least, because even the OG Cerave cream burns my face sometimes and this product did not.
I'll probably just end up giving this to my husband who has a much oilier skin type, hopefully it will work better for him than it did for me."

My skin itches and burns as well.Clinique really missed the mark with this one. For reference I have normal skin, 42, don't wear makeup. 
Great SPF, feels fine going on but once you start rubbing/massaging into the skin - white swathes cling to dry patches and remain white all day. Over rubbing causes this to pill. Anything applied underneath it causes this to pill. Touching your face causes this to pill. Fabric touching your cheeks causes this to pill.

Leaves my face feeling nice and hydrated while also providing protection. Doesn't feel greasyIts better than no SPF at all, but not my fav. Works best alone, not under makeup. Can be heavy and greasy and the sun protection isnt awesom (I burned after an hour). At least it's not expensive!This is my favorite inexpensive moisturizer, but the packaging is awful!

I prefer it to using steroids or other topical prescriptions whenever possible.  Great product.Super expensiveâ¦ but this is the only lotion that doesnt cause breakouts on my back and I actually notice the amount of back breakouts have lessened when i use this. 
Makes my skin feel really soft instead of just coated.I could have sworn I remembered this being a holy grail product for the acne on my back and shoulders, and I also remembered it being significantly less expensive than it is now. Now, it contains mineral oil and has done nothing to help my body breakouts - in fact I feel more greasy and more broken out than before! Works okay for other parts of my body less prone to acne (like fighting ingrown hairs on legs, etc) but it's just too expensive for the ingredients list now.It truly, magically removes the bumps after a few applications.Definitely made my bumpy skin smooth but it has parabens :( I wont be buying this againI'm super disappointed with this product and also shocked at all of the good reviews. This comes highly recommended by dermatologists and I was excited to try it. I have KP as well as psoriasis and this lotion made both WORSE. I wish I was joking. Immediately after putting this on, my skin would feel dryer and I thought I was just being crazy. But after 1 whole month of using this after every shower I can confidently say that this did not work for me. My skin is drier, my KP is worse; I've literally never had this many bumps on my arms before, and my psoriasis patches are even more irritated. Honestly super upsetting.Wow.

But I would recommend in the summer as a sunscreen of you have oily skin!!I used this for 5 years and it worked great. I have oily skin and it kept my skin matte and oil free for 12 hours. It's definitely expensive for such a small tube, but it was worth it. I dont know if there has been a formula change but my skin is now oily after a few hours. I'll be looking elsewhere.Im not sure if I just got a defective tube but it dispenses as soon as I unscrew the top which is wasteful and messy. The product itself is OK - it does a better job mattifying than a regular moisturizer but I will likely not buy again until I can be sure it is worth the money and not all have an issue dispensing the product. I will likely try something else in the meantime, especially for the money.I'm surprised by the low rating for this. I have very oily skin, and this keeps me matte for much longer. Helps make pores look a little smaller. Since I don't bake myself in the sun, I assume the SPF works fine too. I've never gotten burned when out and about. This is my new sunscreen forever.This is a nice product and I like Murad but it absorbs too quickly. I have purchased this moisturizer multiple times and everytime I mostly regret it because I always have to use a lot for my face to feel moisturized. If I don't put enough on I get dry skin flakes on my nose area or my skin just feels dry and tight. A little does not go a long way. It's definitely magnifying, I'll give it that."

Ive been aftuggling for what seems like forever to find a good moisturizer that wasnt scented or full of extra junk. Im in my 40's and tend to be really dry with some patches of oiliness at times and f moisturizer works really well for me. My only piece of advice is to either apply it a couple of hours before your make up, or to use it as an overnight moisturizer as it becomes very sticky on the skin when applied. it takes a long time for the lotion to sink into your skin, but when it does, the effect is perfection.This moisturizer goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling buttery soft.

It's way too expensive to not show any improvements.I love this product (this skincare line period). I havent been dissatisfied yet but im always sad when my bottle runs out. My only con is that its pricey but I feel like its worth it and my skin agrees. If I could only afford one thing I would hands down buy this. I recommend using at night because its not really all that lightweight but doesnt cause me to breakout. I can also mix with moisturizer from the same brand (or different) and it does not affect the performanceThis retinol does work.

Love it so much!I love all of Dermalogica products. This is like a mix of a cream serum compound to me but a cream texture. I have a tiny face and it takes two pumps to get the adequate amount I need for my face and neck. It dries on the skin very quickly but not dries like you cant feel it, dries like you can't spread it. So you have to get it everywhere you want quickly. Then it is very tacky so it should be the last thing you apply. If you apply anything afterwards you will get pilling. All that being said it does wonders for my skin. Leaves my skin glowing and fresh after i use it. It plumps it up and helps my pores as well skin texture. Its an amazing vitC face product. I find it hard to fall in love with vitC skincare products but always want to have one in my regimen. This has been the only one that truly does everything it promises to do. It does have some cons but i just dont use it on days I'm planning on wearing makeup. If you are a daily makeup wearer id recommend using it either hours before or in the evening. You get a good amount for the price. Its got a nice dispenser. Overall i give 5 stars cause not everything can be completely perfect in every aspect but if you get what you want from it can you really be upset.It does not feel weightless.

I actually use this as a serum, and I put the Dermalogica Age Smart SPF 50 on top of it. It lasts way longer that way and the moisturizing effect is insane. I am obsessed - Dermalogica has done it again!I put on makeup a couple hours after applying and it totally clashed with my tinted moisturizer, the texture was awful and it's very scented tooI have very dry flaky and sensitive skin and all other products tend to pill on my face. This product has been amazing at keeping my face moisturized all day long and I havent noticed any scent to it. I'm able to rub it all over my face and lips with no burning sensation and it feels lightweight and moisturized. I've not had a single pimple in the entire 2-3 months I've used this product!

I bought this La Roche posay moisturizer and it burned immediately.

I guess I'm still searching for my perfect affordable moisturizer.Literally the only moisturizer that has put my rosacea at ease. Only downside is it is quite expensive for such a small bottle.I have dry skin that can be sensitive to ingredients in moisturizers. I use two pumps of this on my face, twice a day after cleansing and serum. I apply serum to damp skin, let it soak in, then apply the moisturizer. Out of several sensitive skin moisturizers I tried so far, this is the only one that never makes me itchy or red. My skin is less flaky and inflamed than usual this winter so I think this is working for me and I will repurchase. It seems to layer well with other products and makeup.This product.... I cannot say enough great things!! I break out with a lot of moisturizers, but THIS ONE actually helped CLEAR my breakouts. It says on the box it's tested on allergy-prone skin, so I tried it and I'm SO GLAD I did. Also wearable under makeup and great for any time of day. Love this. Just went and bought another bottle!!!Don't claim to not change the formula when the ingredients are different on the packaging. It burns my face, caused acne, smells terrible. like why. why are brands changing things that are already big sellers???I am so upset. This was the only thing that worked for my sensitive, acne-prone skin. I recently ran out of the original moisturizer and bought this new one without realizing it had changed. In days, my skin broke out with painful acne all over my cheeks. 

Why would you reformulate something that worked for so many people? Safe to say, I am returning the moisturizer I bought and I'll have to look elsewhere for something that my skin will tolerate. Very disappointed in LRP. Please do the right thing and bring back the original formula.This product is not like the ultra eye cream. It's drying and tends to be sticky.  It's also peels when I try to use a concealer over it.  I will be looking for another eye cream."

Oily skin friendly!Finding a product like foundation or cream that doesnt irritate my skin (i have sensitive dry skin, psoriasis, eczema, acne) is a nightmare. I am irritated by hylaronic acid which is in everything now but not this!. I wanted a moisturing night cream with angi-aging properties. When i use this at night i wake up with skin looking plump and feeling refreshed. the TBT cream I will be repurchasing. 10/10 would recommend.I've been looking for a new moisturizer because the one I've been using for months just didn't seem to be doing its job anymore, and I saw positive reviews for this one. jI didn't realize this was a ""night cream"" when I bought it until I read the fine print on the packaging, but it's part of my daily/nightly skincare routine and my skin LOVES it! It actually moisturizes, and it's just been a week but I've noticed how plumped up and soft and youthful my skin looks. It's so much healthier! A little goes a long way, and you can always pop on a smidge more if needed but it's hydrating."

I just brought one and went on a road trip and i feel kike i wasted 1/2 the product. It leaks and separates everywhere. At the end of the day buy the smaller size. The chances of the product spilling are much more insignificant. Not worth the hassel.I'm white. I burn. The only  kind of tan I csn get is fake. Buy this stuff for yourself and family. Your parents need sunblock too and may not use it  The PA ++++ on the label indicates a higher than usual level of protection which means  it's the GOOD STUFF. Use it year round  and thank me laterI've been using this product for while now and i will never use another sunscreen bc this one is not only perfect to wear everyday but to use as a primer under makeup.The susncreen is easy to apply and leaves no white cast. The scent is pleasant as well. The only downside to this sunscreen is that it is very greasy/oily on. If you have really dry skin this may leave you ""glowy"", but not if you have oily skin.I love how this absorbs into my skin with no white cast! It leaves me so glowy and moisturized. This is favorite sunscreen and i use it EVERYDAY. so obsessed I recommend it to everyone.This sunscreen is easy to apply and spread on face and neck as well as body. It smells like citrus and does not burn my eyes like other chemical sunscreens ive used. I also like how there is a refill option to reduce waste. What I dislike about this sunscreen is how greasy it leaves the skin especially if you you apply a sufficient amount, Your face will look shiny. My skin type is dry and acne prone btw and it is hdrating enough over a serum in the morning and has not caused cystic acne."

My skin was not cracking anymore amd i could touch my face without it hurting. 10/10 would recommend, i'm already on my 3 bottel!I believed the young lady who helped was named Kat.

Sadly, it wasn't for me.Bought this trying out new moisturizers as my old one was discontinued. And THANK GOD I chose this. It doesnt feel oily at all, nor does it leave any film or stickyness. It comes as a clear gel but it almost melts into the water I spray on my face for when I moisturize. I was worried about it having perfume and my skin reacting to it, but it doesnt have a strong smell and it smells  clean, and like it has some SPF in there but I could be wrong. I was also worried about the amount of product since you can't seem to find anything that lasts anymore but it has plenty of product, plus I dont seem to need as much as other products, so it works out. This is definitely my new go-to moisturizer, my skin looks more clear and healthy and my redness has even gone down a bit. 10/10, 5 stars, would recommend.works pretty good definitely would recommendit is very hydrating and lightweight but my only problem is that it is sticky, if they fixed that it would be perfectIt was sticky and made my wrinkles more obvious"

Listenâ My makeup has never pilled so badly. Love her, but not for makeup days. So I'll use the rest of it for my dÃ©colletage area i guess , but pass on this if you are a makeup bb.The formula on this is great. The product is more of a gel than a lotion/cream which I do enjoy, however it leaves my skin looking oily. If you prefer your skin to look more dewy or glossy, this will do it for you. It's a good product but not for me.the minute this goes on your skin it feels great and moisturizing but after about 10 minutes it starts peeling of your skinYou can smell the spf but it goes on so smooth without a white cast. I've been using this in place of moisturizer in the morning and I feel like I can see a difference in my skin already! I do not wear makeup, but there is no pilling. I like the packaging and pump- mess free. Would recommend to a friend!I LOVE this stuff. Feels almost identical to my favorite summer fridays deep oasis moisturizer, but also has spf.

Omg! What a difference. The redness in my cheeks and by the corners of my nose went away. And my skin looked immediately brighter. The feel of the creme itself is SO luxurious and you only need a little bit so it will last a longer time (of course we want that with this price lol)I love this product and ordered it online for a mother's day gift. However, I somehow got a refill, so it came in a plastic container with a tear-away foil cover and no jar. I didn't even know refills existed for this. I didn't have a container to place it in (other than using a cheap Ziploc bag), so it would have dried out. Hence, I had to return it. I'm not sure if others have had this issue, but Ulta, please be aware!Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo my mom is a dermatologist and she loves it!!!!!!!!I have been using this cream for about a month and a half. It feels pleasant and smells beautiful, but does not live up to its claims in my experience. My face does not feel fully hydrated by the end of the day, never mind 24 hours. I have not witnessed brightening or firming. A big selling point (and likely excuse for the huge price tag) is the Grand Rose extract, which LancÃ´me does a poor job explaining the benefit of. Luckily I had Ulta points to use on this cream, and not my own money. I got roped into the illusion of grandeur and prestige with this Absolue cream. Don't be like me. Much more effective and affordable creams are available on the market. Research ingredients; rose extract offers unremarkable and lackluster benefits. Perhaps the Pro-Xylane and shea butter can, but certainly not in this formulation.This product is amazing! Expensive as heck but amazing. I originally tried this as a sample and noticed a difference from just the sample. My skin has NEVER felt so soft and smooth! Make sure to purchase when there's a 20% off code otherwise it's a lot.Most say ""it softens the skin""  Goodness ladies, you can ""soften skin"" with products that are free of chemicals and work to soften.. A cream at this ridiculous price should do more than ""SOFTEN"".. I received a teeny tiny sample of it .. Sorry I don't believe one can see any difference whatsoever with 4 drops of a cream with a strong perfume smell.

Absolutely fantastic! I've been using this dual-phase anti-aging firming serum for a few weeks now and I'm truly impressed. The combination of CAMU CAMU, hyaluronic acid, and green coffee bean extract has worked wonders on my skin. Not only does it feel firmer, but the fine lines and wrinkles are noticeably reduced. The texture is light and non-greasy, making it a pleasure to use. I highly recommend this serum to anyone looking for an effective anti-aging solution.Dermalogica phyto nature firming serum has a lot of powerful ingredients to make this serum amazing for fine lines and wrinkles.

Very happy with my purchase & will keep buying it! Mixes great with serums from Drunk Elephant & others alike, too.I started using this product in September of last year. I liked how light it was. I started to get tiny closed comedones all over my chin and occasional deep cystic pimples. Just recently I stopped and it is clearing up. Should have stopped soonerI got a tester as a bonus and absolutely had to buy a full size. This product is a great balance between price and effectiveness. But please for all thats good and nice CHANGE THE PACKAGING. This type of product really needs a pump bottle or something but this one is so hard to handle.I've never had breakouts like I've had with this. It makes me so sad because I wanted to like it so bad.

I just bought my second one as well.Great texture but made me break out and I never break out .I initially loved this as I am a big fan of the brand but towards the end of the product, it started adding conjunction to my face from over-moisturizing. Overall great and I would definitely recommend it as a night cream.To be fair I just started using it and so far my skin feels nice and looks hydrated but if they can work on anything immediately it should be the scent. It smells like something expired even though its isnt, woofI received a sample of this in an Ulta order. It wasn't boxed and I don't recall if the small sample had the ingredients on it. I used this twice and got the worst cystic pimple I have ever had it my life. The kind that kept coming back for 2 months before it finally shriveled up and died for good.
Looking at the ingredients now, I see that one of the top ingredients in it is coconut oil. Coconut oil is highly comedogenic, and in my experience, anytime a product includes it in the ingredients, I will suffer.
Highly recommend that people who are breakout prone, especially with coconut oil, avoid this."

But after it dries, my skin literally feels so soft and stays moist all day long. I love it! And the fact that it's actually created to be safe for sensitive skin is a huge bonus for me and is exactly what I look for in skincare products.

Don't recommendI got thus product for free during one of my purchases, and let me just say, I am SOOO glad.
this was the first product I had from philosophy and I will be returning to buy this for myself and others â¡!
after getting this product I went and bought the mini exfoliating product they have and I pair those two together daily when I don't do my full routine:)
can't wait to try other products 
I have sensitive skin (eczema) and would suggest â¡Love tjis product for my daughter and she loves it too. At her age this is exactly what a teenager/Lil lady needs for moisture and some cover up !!It absorbs quickly, which is nice, but there is so much perfume in this moisturizer. It is irritating to my skin."

A little goes such a long way. I have pretty sensitive/combination skin.Received a GWP sample from Ulta.

Opened to use and it has blooms of mold spores!

Yikes.

The product was never opened and never used. Promptly went into the trashI got this as a freevie and thank God it was a freebie. 0/10. If by dewy they mean greasy, then yes! I have normal-sometimes dry skin and I used it on a ""dryer"" day, it felt really gross and warm on my face. Very similar to vaseline. Thick and very difficult to wash hands after. Oil stains on my wash towel. I didn't have the red and blotchy allergic reactions like a lot of the other receiws, but this is glorified vaseline."

The texture is so soothing and hydrating, it's like both a cream AND a gel, which absorbs even faster into my skin. I love the improvement it made in my overall skin health. My complexion is brighter and my skin is smoother than it was before I began regularly using it daily. It's non-irritating, but it slightly tingles until your skin gets used to the potency of the Vitamin C. It is a great product and perfect for all skin types! I Have combination skin that is dry and oily. This is so soothing and hydrating without clogging your pores! It makes your skin complexion brighter and more radiant!This eye perfector reduced my eye circles by alot! I see a big difference & so do all my friends & family. I get tons of compliments. I would definitely recommend!Love this BeautyStat Serum!  Absorbs so quickly and plumps up my skin. Does not pill or cause makeup to streak. I will be purchasing this again.

I sometimes can't wait for this step in my skincare routine. I just love how good it feels going on.  It locks in moisture without feeling oily, too thick or too heavy.This gel moisturizer seeps into the skin nicely, a little goes a long way. I have eczema, when it was super raw this did sting a little. The baby powder smell is OK, didn't bother me and I didn't love it either. This gentle yet effective for dry skin days. I love that it's non-comodogenic, for reference I have oily/dry combo skin that is acne prone.I wish this product was fragrance free. It has a very strong baby powder fragrance. The product itself works beautifully but the fragrance is so strong I can't use it.I absolutely am in love with this product it literally makes me look ð like a movie star every time I put it on and did I mention that I don't wear any makeup up this product is a blessing from God periodâ¼ï¸ðListen to the reviews, im not one to be picky about fragrance but the smell of this is overwhelming!

It may feel slightly ""heavy"" at first but it absorbs. Great for sensitive skin, as well! So happy I found this brandI tried a couple of retinal creams, and had breakouts and/or burning. Having used many Avene products with great results, I took their skin quiz online, and this product was recommended. It is a great alternative to retinol, at a very low dosage so you can start to build use. I've had great success with it, and it is helping with fine lines around my eyes. I can use it every night with absolutely no irritation."

Great texture but I reacted badly to something in it. Guessing it was the algae because I've used the other ingredients before without issue.DO NOT BUY new formula is horrible. Not the same product whatsoever. Why ruin a great product everyone loved?? Makes no sense. Ive gone through at least 10 of these moisturizers and now i will no longer purchase. And the new scent is a crime against humanity.This used to be SOOOO awesome.  Now my face oily by 10 am and feels very irritated.  Also broke me out for the first time in a while.  Had zero issues with the old formula.  I really hope they change it backWhat a great and rich sunscreen! The texture of this is super rich and hydrating while feeling so comfortable on my skin. I love that it doesn't leave a white film over my skin, it just soaks right in. Gifted by SupergoopThis was my holy grail of moisturizers with sunscreen for years. It kept my skin hydrated without making it greasy, had no scent, played well with any eye cream I paired it with and never broke me out. Since the formula change, this has given me nothing but problems.
First is the scent. IT REEKS. It smells like a burning pit and the smell does NOT dissipate. I am super sensitive to scents and the old formula had a slight smell to it but you didn't notice it after you put it on.
Next, the consistency is now a bit chalky and not as creamy as it used to be.
Lastly, the hydration is gone. My skin is dry about 45 minutes after I put this on. Now, that could be mostly due to my skin hating the new formula, so take this as you will.
I hate that I have to stop using this. It was a decent price and worked well for me which can be hard to come by, but I'll sadly have to give it up.Leave my skin oily and shiny , but i still use it because it was blending good with my make up and wasn't leaving a white cast on my skin until i checked the actives ingredients are not recommended for breastfeeding (actually not good for anyone) and it has a sunscreen smell so  im switching to a mineral susncreen.This looks like I'll  be fhe first non-incentivized review. I love the unseen sunscreen and was so excited to try a rich cream with spf as i have very dry skin. The texture of the product when i tested on my hand was so nice and absorbed great. However, when I applied it to mt face for the first time i noticed a HORRIBLE smell. It smells like a chemical plant and it lasts the entire time its on my skin. I'm not usually too picky about how fragrance free products smell but this is so bad I have to return."

It is wonderful for my 60 year old skin.Exelente productoI used the Gel-Cream for many years. Used this once and my face was burning and red like a bad sunburn for 2 days.  Bring back the old, amazing formula!! So upset about this!!Just didn't feel the benefit, not an effective moisturizerThought I loved this product for about a month. I have very sensitive skin so it's hard to find a good moisturizer. This one scanned 100% on Yuka and is noncomedogenic so I figured it was great. 

However, I bought a new jar a last week and started getting dry, flaky patches of excema all over my face. I also have noticed tiny specs of glitter but I thought maybe it was makeup. 

So I just put it all over my (clean) hands and they immediately started BURNING and broke into a blotchy rash. It felt like micro cuts, how it feels when I wear super glittery eyeshadow. 

So I took a video with flash, and sure enough teeny tiny specs of shiny micro plastics flashing back at me. GLITTER. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Will not repurchase. This is EVIL NEUTROGENA!!!!!

I had never had this happened!and I've tried a couple of face creams over the past few years. I will be returning and not buying again. I wanted to think this was just me and my skin but after reading reviews i see this has happened a several people.

I LOVE IT!!! It blends GREAT (especially for a product with SPF), isn't greasy, doesn't make my skin oily or shiny, has not caused a breakout, and I can see a clear difference in the moisture level of my skin in just a few days. Anti-aging creams normally make my skin totally freak out, but this one is all good, no bad. Really glad I happened upon it!This contains Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene....FYII joke that this is my old lady face cream because it smells like a bouquet of roses. However, it really does give the skin a lifted appearance and tightened feel. The daytime version has some SPF and wears nice under makeup. I wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin because of the fragrance. Also, I noticed on very dry winter days the product does not have enough moisture for my skinI received this as a sample size from Estee Lauder and I can't wait to buy a full size. This is why I love samples, It lets me fiind out what I love without spending a fortune first.  It has the faintest fragrance that is subtle but lovely. It goes on so smooth and is just pleasant to use. My only complaint is the price. Some of us would buy this brand more often if we weren't priced out of the market. This is why I gave it a four. Otherwise, a five all the way.This smells like febreeze and it doesn't go away when you rub it in :( save your moniesI use this product daily.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. It did not irritate my skin, which can sometimes be an issue for me.  Makeup base glides on smoothly over this moisturizer.  It is my absolute favorite.I wish I could use this product as it seems to work well. However the fragrance is too strong and irritating."

Only downside is that this is expensive so I will wait for coupons/sales in order to repurchase.Love the product.  It helps fight the dryness of my skin, and it feels wonderful going on.I have spent years and a fortune searching for a moisturizer that would help my dry skin. Nothing worked until I found this!!  It may seem a little pricey but it actually works and it lasts a long time. One pump is enough to cover my face and neck. I won't do without this and hope they don't change the formula or discontinue it!!This is an excellent cream to use during the harsh winter months in Chicago. My skin looks and feels so hydrated! Also love that it dispenses the correct amount to ise on your face!Love Dermalogica, but this is a huge miss. Very thick and sticky - it's like putting heavy sunscreen on your face. You can't put this on then go straight to bed as your face sticks to your pillow. This stickiness also feels itchy. So many other great Dermalogica products that feel much nicer on the skin and do a great jobI got this product on sale for the yearly (or bi-yearly?) ""love your skin"" sale. I've recently started using it and was amazed at how well it hydrates my skin and keeps my face from peeling after using tretnoin. I highly recommend it.Dont get me wrong its a good moisturizer but it did irritate my skin. I will not repurchase. I personally dont think it is worth the price at all. Youre better off buying a more affordable moisturizer but if you have the money then go for it. Dont forget its not the bestð"

It is thick yes but keeps the moisture in and doesn't sting. Love it.This is only my second day using this product and I was going to wait longer to review it but every time I use this cream I am amazed at how my skin literally drinks it up. I have combination to oily skin. Acne prone skin since I was a preteen. I recently reintroduced a retinoid (about 2 months ago) to my night time routine (every other night) and my skin has been feeling so dehydrated and oily at the same timeâ¦ so ive been on a hunt to find a hydrating cream. Something that doesnt sit on my skin and definitely not something that I have to constantly reapply bc my skin feels dry again. 
I know the texture can throw some ppl off but I love it. If nothing else has been working to hydrate your skin, GIVE THIS A SHOT!I previously wrote a positive review, but after a couple of weeks of use, I have to update. This moisturized well, but it consistently caused a breakout. It was a zit in a different place every time I used it. Maybe this would work for someone with less acne-prone skin.Yes, it has the consistency of glue. I personally would only use it at night. That said, it really soaks in after a few minutes and I wake up with moisturized skin. Very reasonable price for this effective, cruelty free product.Works great; a very nice, hydrating cream. However, I probably won't be repurchasing because its consistency was thick and felt like glue.I received a product sample as GWP and am so thankful. Have been struggling with sensitivity to anti-aging ingredients resulting in rash for a few months, and now eczema. This product is so soothing and moisturizing. It is the only product I've found that helps and does not irritate. 

The color is weird (gray-lavender). Consistency is almost like white toothpaste. A little goes a LONG way. I saw lots of comments about pilling. If it pills on you, you're simply using too much. 

I will be buying this as soon as my sample runs out."

He has never strayed from this product since. He is adult acne prone and very light skinned, with sensitive skin. Hard to please his skin and it works!makes my skin feel even drier than when i started to use itI like this cleanser in the morning as its hydrating and gentle. I was just using water, which worked okay, but on nights that I slug, i like to use this to give a gentle wash.

Its keeps me moisturized but its no different than a Olay product for half the cost.I'm in love! after just 1 week of using this, my almost 45 year old skin has never looked better. It took a day or 2 for my skin to adjust to it. Was a little itchy at first but that has gone away. I can actually FEEL my skin tightening up and feel the quenching. I can't wait to use it every day. Amazing!I really wanted to love this moisturizer. It is very thick and perfect for my nighttime routine. It would be amazing for winter months. I actually also love the scent of it. It makes my skin feel completely moisturized and looks glowy afterwards as well. Unfortunately I have dry, sensitive skin and it has caused severe breakouts all over my face. For the price I paid I'm disappointed but always a risk I take when trying a new product.I was hesitant to buy this cream. I have tried so many different brands that promise some of the same things. Then I tested a small amount on the back of my hand in store. I was shocked, it even made my aging hand look better.
I pulled out my Ulta card and purchased, thinking I will try this one jar and see. I was still skeptical.
I have been using this for 2 1/2 month and notice a huge difference in my skin. I HIGHLY recommend this moisturizer. If you are on the fence, take the plunge. And yes, I am telling my friends about this (at least the ones I like)!This is a really great feeling moisturizer. Goes on smooth and leaves your skin smooth.I always thought moisturizers don't do much considering they tend to just sit on top of skin unlike serums so I never invested in a moisturizerâ¦ but after reading the patent ingredient and other ingredients I wanted to give this a shot. First time use I thought it was okay. But on day 3 my skin was already glowing and texture and lines looking softer!!! I never thought I could get that popular Korean beauty glass skin look but this is it !!!!! I am shook and obsessed with this now.I love fresh and had been using the rose deep hydration cream before i purchased this bottle for the anti aging benefits.  When you first apply, it looks so smooth and plump, like wearing the best primer.  After just 4 days of use I'm already noticing the firming effects and see some of my fine lines looking softened.

It does not absorb into my skin, but just sits on top. I've tried it in so many combinations and it's just incompatible with other skin care and foundations (I've tried several foundations -high end & low end- with same results).  I've also tried using it with serums, different primers, different sunscreens and alone with the same result. This is a hard pass for me.In my early adulthood i had terrible acne and skin probs. I tried proactive and everything at the drugstore, nothing worked. I found Kiehl's and my skin turned right around and I've never had a problem since. Im willing to pay for good skin care, but this price still hurts. My skin would feel waxy and really greasy for a long time which aggravated my pores, which in turn aggravated me. It doesnt feel moisturizing at all. I feel like i just wasted a lot of money. Kiehl's let me down for the first time : (It goes on creamy and smoothly, and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks so good. Been using this and all Kiehls products for many years.This was extremely irritating to my skin. It started to burn and little pimples developed. I had to wash it off immediately.  Fortunately, this was a sample product. I will never be purchasing this item!I got a free sample of this with purchase from Ulta and I greatly appreciate it but this really Burns my skin especially around my nose. I read reviews from other people that had the same irritations. I have no idea what is in this cream that burns and stings for hours.Really sad about this cream because I thought it was gonna be the holy grail. But I have seen no difference in my skin and it burns when I apply it (I don't have sensitive skin at all)Really hoped to like this product. I have early 50s skin, a few wrinkles, lots of redness. Normal to dry usually. Within a week, I developed deep acne along cheeks, chin, and jawline. Thought it was just an adjustment. After four weeks, it's a total no go. Will be returning."

Cannot figure out which ingredient i would be allergic to. Put Cortizone and neosporin all over my face to calm it down.Just seemed it wasn't worth the money. It didn't last all that long. I didn't see a difference in my skin.Initially, very underwhelmed w/this product. Decided to finish my small sample tube & wow! In my 50's w/normal-dry skin & VERY acne prone.

I hoped the reviews were wrong, but it definitely leaves a white cast over your skin, and made me look super pale, despite the fact that I have a fair, medium skin tone.I have tried almost every mineral sunscreen under the sun. I'm fair skin, freckles, burn easily, break out easily and this sunscreen moisturizer has been amazing. There is a white cast initially but I rub the product between my fingers before applying and it blends within 5 minutes! I never get sunburn on my face while wearing this. I also apply a ceramide barrier serum beforehand and do not experience any dryness while using this product. Would absolutely purchase a cool toned tinted version of this.I like this sunscreen for days inside where im not too worried about reapplying. This sunscreen feels great on the skin once rubbed in, but its a workout to do so. I'd give this more stars if it wasnt so hard to rub in, which is why i use it on days I'm inside. It also gives a slight white cast but it does go away quickly. Otherwise, it's very moisturizing and doesnt feel tight on my dry skin even if i forget moisturizer underneath.I like the product don't need a lot if  too much is used it will leave a white shade  that's the only thing I don't like but keep in mind that it's also have sunscreen maybe that's why it's white .  I will keep using it. Since I use less products.This is a great sunscreen. It can be applied as a morning moisturizer. However, the product is very thick when rubbing in and does leave a white cast. It does evebtyally soak in but does make me look paler. 
Doesnt clog my pores. Still love it!The white cast this leaves is so bad its almost impossible to fully rub in and then if you sweat it sweats off completley white. Its a nice light consistency and doesnt burn if it gets in the eyes which is good but the white cast makes it not worth it considering how many other SPF options tbere are.This is very thick and leaves a white cast on your face. I think it eventually fades, but takes several minutes. It does seem to get the job done though."

To me, the name is a little misleading.I have struggled FOREVER finding a good moisturizer. I have extremely acne prone skin, and a ton of moisturizers break me out or give me fungal acne. I use this in the morning since its a lightweight moisturizer and it leaves my skin feeling nice but not greasy. I have combination skin, it used to be more oily before I started going to a dermatologist and was put on a topical that tends to dry me out. I do prefer a thicker moisturizer at night, but I will continue purchasing this one over and over!I love the honest product line and use many other honest products so i gave this a try. 

It leaves my skin really shiny, i can feel it on my face, almost kind of oily, and it looks thick in the container but when you put it on its super thin and watery. For it to feel so useless and thin and watery and still make my face feel gross and oily is beyond me. Definitely wont be using again.Great moisturizer. I really like how it has a water like texture after applying so it feels extra hydrating and soothing. My skin is very reactive so seeing it was EWG approved made me want to try, I wish I found this sooner!!The texture of this is insane and so unique. When you start to appy it it feels like a typical moisturizer and as you work it into your skin it begins to feel like a water/serum hybrid. So lightweight, not greasy, and soooooo hydrating. This is my favorite texture of a moisturizer everThe texture of this is insane and so unique. When you start to appy it it feels like a typical moisturizer and as you work it into your skin it begins to feel like a water/serum hybrid. So lightweight, not greasy, and soooooo hydrating. This is my favorite texture of a moisturizer everI used this product all the time almost a year ago and i am acne prone but it never broke me out or caused redness and it was super hydrating and creamy & i recently just got it again & im assuming they changed the ingredients because it has caused severe redness and warmth in my face and a rash and some small pimples. It also was a little rough this time and hard to spread . But it did make my face  feel very smooth and hydrated"

This does not moisturize and is more of a thick green paste that makes your make up look bad too. YikesThis lotion is ok. I realized after buying and using that la roche posay is not a cruelty free line. Will never repurchase.I've been using this product for about two weeks and noticed a difference with my redness but recently got a slight sunburn which it does not help for.At first I was skeptical about this product due to the reviews but I just went ahead and tried it anyways after trying it I realized this is a good product for when I do not feel like wearing make up especially because I do have acne scars but the only fall down is I've tried other products that are green and they are supposed to correct redness and they have worked better than this product this product is not as full coverage as other products I have used in the past but I would still purchase this productAwful. Do not buy. Zero moisture benefit. Feels and looks like you are applying green concealer tint all over your face, sits on top of your skin, peels and looks awful.Leave my skin super smooth and flawlessAs past reviews have stated...it is a bit thicker but it does soak in nicely. I believe that it says to apply in the morning which is ok for a bit thicker. It dulls the redness and makes makeup application more even toned. I recommend trying....the good thing with Ulta..satisfaction guaranteed!"

The smell is light and fruity. I'm so happy I gave it a try.Though I do love the way this lotion feels on my skin, I won't purchase this again unless the packaging changes. It feels cheap and only works about 2/3 of the time. The scent of the lotion also takes some getting used to.I like the feel on my skin. It has a lot of moisture in it and my skin looks good when using.  I get a lot of compliments regarding my skinMakes my combination skin feel balanced and plumpThis product is a must buy! I absolutely love the way the cream absorbs in my skin and doesn't feel heavy or thick.Product itself is good.  But the packaging is cheap.  I returned the first purchase because the pump broke after 1st use. Exchanged it and so far pump is working but doesn't feel sturdy.  Could improve packaging for this price.This moisturizer leaves my skin feeling and looking so hydrated & dewy. However, I hate hate hate the packaging. I feel as if it was cleaply made, the top with the pump is contantly coming off and I get worried the product will spill out. Formulation and texture are on point though, I will definitely be repurchasing."

Ive used Hope In a Jar which is great so i exchanged it.A very light cream for daily use.. it is the consistent application - twice a day that gives absolute amazing results!  A little goes a long way.  Not called Miracle Worker for nothing!  This travel size makes is easy to 'give it a try' without breaking the bank!  But.. you will find out that investing in the regular size jar is so worth it!does not work with makeupThis is the one and only for my skin! I absolutely love it! It is thick and creamy and it keeps my skin very hydrated at my age (54)!I have used this product for many years. I have tried cheaper options, but always come back to this product. It is rich in moisture. I have combination skin and have no issues with the richness of the moisture.I am 30/AA with dry skin and this is always my go to even after I've used other products. It keeps my skin hydrated and its easy to apply makeup even on the days I forget to use my primer. Always been a a fanI bought this moisturizer for my fine lines by my smile, eyes and forehead. I definitely see a difference in my skin since using. This moisturizer lives up to the name: MIRACLE WORKER."
176,176,176,coola,refreshing water cream spf 50,pimprod2021554,2575597,"Has a cool and soft touch to the face. I also love the packaging.This product made my face break outI have very dry skin to the point it hurts sometimes, and I'm very particular about always wearing sunscreen on my face; I love this moisturizer/sunscreen! It really hydrates my skin, protects from the sun, and doesnt make me breakout either! I really enjoy the way it dispenses because it helps me to not use too much/too little of the product.I have very dry skin and this stuff works its magic! Worth the price in my opinion. One jar lasted me a couple of months using it dailyi loveeeee this spf! it feels like a hydrating moisturizer but with 50 spf! which is amazing! it has an easy to use push down pump which i like. its a must have and a definite re-purchase for when i run out! run and get this!I got this product on sale, which is why I bought it. The regular price tag is a bit hefty. I really like it; I have dry skin that gets greasy the moment it doesn't get enough moisture, and very acne prone. Many products break me out immediately. While I don't think this product does anything favorable in terms of acne when it's already there, I at least think that it doesn't break me out. It gives the skin a really nice look on its own, and as long as it dries first it looks nice under my other makeup. I prefer a dewier, glossier skin, so it might not work for everyone. My skin is definitely healthier since I started using it each morning. I will probably bite the bullet and rebuy despite the price tag.This formula probably really slaps for dry skin, but my sensitive combo skin gels pretty well with it too, all things considered. It glides beautifully on the skin and leaves a glowy hydrated finish. I would prefer if it had no fragrance at all, but my limited understanding of cosmetic ingredients tells me that what they did add to scent the product is mostly pretty mild. There is a love-hate relationship with the packaging tooâwhile I love the way it dispenses the same amount every time (and it's enough sunscreen!) I find that the base weight of this packaging combined with its opaque blue color make it difficult to predict when the product will run out. It is also obscenely overpriced, which is probably my chief complaint about it. Coola could have done better on this one in a lot of ways, but I haven't found a formula I like this much ever, so the search continues."

I'm halfway through my second jar in a row, and am noticing less smoothing and plumping of my skin than I had before. It moisturizes just fine, but nothing else.Went to see my Derm and was told my skin looked really good. I took a photo of this Roc product and told her the price. She was shocked yhat it was working so well. Me I'm very happy that it is affordable and worksâ£ï¸It's love from fist use. I can tell that my face has more clarity. After a week I noticed my fine lines are softer even my frown lines became less noticeable. I'm very happy with Roc. I spent hundreds of dollars on more expensive products and noticed nothing of skin improvement, but the result this cream gave me is amazing. I can't wait to buy the eye cream from this version. I believe the retinol in this product has nailed it . It meets with the secrets of skin care beauty. Thank u Roc and thank u Ulta for selling the best for ur customers.I am 75 yrs old and have never seen any cream work as well as this. I am blown away by it and the difference it has made in my complexion.  I have very few wrinkles for my age and this has done a great job  with perfecting my complexion.I am a mature woman, and have dry skin, with some dark spots.  This product is amazing!  In one week, my spots began to fade.  Looking at my skin, I notice a fresh dewy look!  Compared to many other products, this is an affordable option, which really works!My first ever review on Ulta. Buy this! I ran out of an expensive retinol serum, and wanted something more $ friendly and a retinol and moisturizer in one. I've been using for 2 weeks now, and my skin looks extremely healthy. I am also pairing with a vitamin c serum. Now, I know the potency is legit because I dumbly went to use the infrared sauna after I used this. Needless to say I have myself a little irritation and redness because of how potent this was. It goes well under makeup, I don't even need a primer I just use setting spray throughout my routine, and the moisturizer isn't overwhelming. This is my new go to moisturizer.After reading a bunch of reviews, trying several expensive and inexpensive options, this has finally been the best moisturizer for my chronically dry 46 year old skin. My skin finally feels hydrated all day, no more crepe paper forehead, cheeks feel soft."

I started retinol with my dermatologist but really wanted an alternative to full coverage foundations like mac studiofix and estee lauder double wear, as my skin is happier without heavy makeup. I tried this after seeing my hairdresser use it and it's amazing!! it balances out the pink from my undertones and blends the red from acne breakouts and irritation without there being a noticeable mark. At first I didn't like this product as much because I tend to be heavy handed and applied it like a foundation but when you apply it like a lotion (lightly) it blends in easier and doesn't come off orange around the hairline.Love it!â¦ I hate to wear foundation. I use this to correct some redness on my chin, works wonders. Ive gotten so many compliments about how smooth my skin looks!Unfortunately, this product delivered zip, zilch, zero for me.  It did not read orange on me, but also provided minimal if any redness coverage for me.  I tried varying different amounts of product, methods of application-no dice.  I don't write negative reviews based on breakouts bc I feel that is so much based on individual sensitivities, but this also did result in a breakout on my cheeks within a few days of trying it out.i have very pale skin and redness from acne scars and rosacea. i LOVE this product. it evens my skin tone so well i sometimes dont even need concealer or foundation. i also like that it helps with my acne if im having a break out. i use this everydayI have significant redness on both cheeks and this product is a blessing!  I have decent skin otherwise so I can easily use this on the cheeks and not have to wear foundation.  I put it on after my moisturizer routine.I started getting really bad rosacea in my later 20s. I was never big into makeup and skin care - my sister gave me a few things to try and i samples some things store employees recommended but everything just made it look worse but making it still red but now looked like i was obviously trying to cover it up in a gross way. 

In my 30s i decided to do something about it and jumped into the wonderful world of skincare and in tandem - makeup. While trying to tame the flair ups, i tried to find something to cover it up - foundation, skin tints, concealer - all the products marketed to solve my problem didnt. They all made it look worse stillâ¦until I found this product from Hero. I found a tiny travel size and thought what can it hurt, ive tried everything else. I honestly couldnt believe it when i put it on after my morning skin care. I cried i was so happy - dramatic, sure, but trueâ¦if you have rosecea flair up that have taken over your reality then you might get it. 

This magical elixir tamed the redness in my face while also looking like my skin and didn't make it feel like i had tons of make up on.  this product literally gave me back my confidence while i work diligently to get my skin barrier as healed as possible while living wirh rosacea. 

I also can use it as a primer and then top it with one of the good skin tint products ive found over time for more coverage, but even when just running to the store i throw this on quickly and poof, im no longer so self conscious of my bring red, splotchy face and i feel like a human again.  

Besides the expensive Erborian version, which is pretty solid, but heavily scented and I cant afford, this one doesnt turn me orange like other renditions of this product that are in a similar price point. 

Only issue: i wish it came in bigger bottlesi love using this product so much. it helps reduce my pimples in a few hours and especially overnight. my acne is less red and im so happy i can use this with no makeup. i would normally use concealer to cover my spots but this works AMAZING. pls moisturize ur skin bc it can get dry"

My pores look smooth, its calming & hydrating without looking greasy. A little goes a long way.I LOVE THIS! My skin took around a week to really settle into this as my face reacts to new things. However once i got into the routine of using this, my pores look smooth, my skin is plump, and is overall hydrating without looking greasy. It also calms down the redness I have on my cheeks. A little goes a long way. I finally found a moisturizer that works for me.I was hesitant to try this however, it makes my skin feel great.  I use this with a few of the same line and I believe my skin looks and feels tighter and more moisturized!Decided to switch up my moisturizer just out of curiosity. This one was definitely on the pricier side from what I'm used to, but it's totally worth it! I used to advocate for the Cerave one, but after trying this one, I don't know if I'll ever go back. It's super hydrating and my skin still looks glowy and healthy after a full face of matte makeup. I definitely noticed a difference after adding this cream to my skin care routine. My skin looks so much smoother and healthier than it ever has before.I really love this moisturizer. It pairs well with the ampoule and toner but is also great on its own. Its very hydrating and has helped a lot with my redness and gives me an overall glow. I hope they never stop making it. It absorbs quickly and is never tacky, greasy, oily or pilly. I have sensitive dry combination skin and this has done wonders for me. I found it on Stylevana for half the price, highly recommend.I have been using this product for a while now and im on my third bottle.. I think it's time for a review! I HIGHLY recommend this product if you have sensitive or dry skin. Due to my lupus, my skin is both. Thanks to this moisturizer though, I can finally hydrate my skin without irritating it!

I change up my toners, serums and moisturizers every now and then. I have a couple favorites. Now, Ginzing Energizing Gel Cream with Caffeine + Niacinamide, this is a daily constant for me. I love the absorption and the end result.  I will buy this again and again.But I do recommend pairing it with CosRx Products! Pairing it with the Snail Mucin Essence and the Snail Mucin Gel Cleanser and the AHA BHA Toner.

Love this cream. It also helped soothe redness from my rosacea on cheeks and nose. The texture is thicker but buttery which melts really nicely into my skin and doesn't leave me greasy like most moisturizers. Highly recommend.splurged on this enticing product to heal overly -exfoliated skin. the product feels great on my skin and is indeed comforting, but even after weeks of use and discontinued exfoliating, my skin is still too dry. won't be repurchasing.My skin recently became ultra sensitive and reactive to things it was never before reactive to. I used some skincare I previously loved and it destroyed my skin. This cream and the barrier restore serum saved my skin in as quick as 3 days!I recently started a retinoid my dermatologist prescribed, and my skin was starting to get red and sensitive to everything I put on it. I decided to try this moisturizer (my first Peach & Lily product) because it claims to calm and soothe the skin.

Definitely works! This is the first moisturizer I've put on my face since starting the retinoid that doesn't cause any stinging. It absorbs fairly quickly and doesn't leave a heavy residue. I have combination oily skin so I'm only using this at night, but after just 4 nights, my skin is feeling much better and no longer stings when I touch it.

There's no fragrance so the cream kind of has a light wet cardboard/plastic smell of all non-fragrance creams, but it's not troublesome and goes away quickly. The only reason I even notice this is bc my previous evening moisturizer had a nice peachy fragrance. 

Highly recommend for ppl whose skin hurts and need something soothing!I purchsed this cream (and the coordinating serum) and have not been a fan from the instant instarted using it. The smell is off-putting, the jar makes a glass scraping doubd when uou open/close it, my skin has randomly started breaking out, and it hardly feels moisturizing. 

I will absolutely be switching back to what i was using before - or continuing to look for a better product.I have sensitive skin and often break out from products, or they'll irritate my face and make my redness worseâ¦ but this cream, girls it's the holy grail! Very lightweight and doesn't leave your skin feeling oily. Takes away my redness and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and plump. I love putting it on before I go to bed.i find that i tend to grab this cream more to use on my skin and I have been loving this cream for my skin barrier. My skin doesn't have any reaction to it so far and my skin has gotten looking better than before. Please never stop this skin barrier product, P&L. thank you ...

I have used this same Clarins face cream for years, this one clearly has the different smell that I used to have. Instead of floral scent, this smells like chemical.I was recommended this by an Ulta employee. I was told there was no fragrance in it and trusted her. Well shame on me because the smell of this moisturizer is exactly like little old grandma bath soaps... like the decorative ones you never use and for good reason. I thankfully applied to my hand not my face, but the smell lingers on the skin after six hand washes. Returning as soon as possible! The smell is so incredibly strong and seems to stain the skin.

Wish they'd reformulate it so I could go back to using it again.I personally wasn't a fan of this product. First I want to point out the sales associates at Ulta are super sexist to men and I got passed multiple times every time I asked for help literally ignored me. But back to this product, it's very similar to sun screen I prefer a thicker face lotion like the 2-1 face & beard but that got discontinued.After years of using Vasaline Intensive Care lotion on his face, I convinced him to try the Clinique For Men Broad Spectrum SPF21 Moisturizer.  He loved it!  For a lotion with sun scree, it's not greasy and  it absorbs into the skin nicely leaving no residue.If you've ever had a reaction to a sunscreen this one probably contains your culprit. Wore once and broke out in a rash/hives where it was applied. I will now be avoiding oxybenzone.Applied it at the store to test it out and also bought some, a few hours later had a giant bump on my chin. Going to rerun it tomorrow.This is the only product my husband doesn't seem to have a skin reaction to.

I can only use it right after showering. Otherwise, if I put it on super dry skin it itches and I have to wash it off. I tried putting it on a painful rash, but I started yelling because doing that made the pain SO much worse. Would never buy again for that reason alone, but also because this brand is NOT CLEAN, CRUELTY-FREE, VEGAN. 

Also, I was told when purchased that the brand is sustainable and cruelty-free and does not test on animals. NOT TRUE AT ALL. I was not in the best headspace since my skin was screaming due to a rash when I was shopping, but I specifically said that I do not use anything that isn't vegan and cruelty-free. I stressed that in my conversations with the beauty advisor who helped me. 

La Roche-Posay is owned by L'Oreal, which is well known for testing on animals. They sell in mainland China, where it is required by law to test products on animals to sell there.

I've always had issues with layering and pilling no matter what i changed before but this product is crazy good and makes it easy, here to repurchase AGAIN. please good molecules never stop making this product and just try it especially if u have oily or combo skinThe product itself and the formula is great, but the packaging is so bad, when I opened the product there was too much pressure on the bottle and it wasted half the bottle of product. This is not the first time this has happened, please fix thisCleared up my skin sooo fast. My skin is not 100% clear but it took care of my major acne asap and feels so good on my skin.This is such an inexpensive product for the quality. I wish it came in a bigger size. This is a staple in my skincare roster! I don't use it everyday, but when I notice a pimple or 2 and it helps clear my skin. Highly recommend.I've been using this product for over a year. It has really helped clear my skin. I use it at least 5 nights a week. I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this does not irritate my skin.I'm in my late 20s, combo/oily skin, still dealing with mild/moderate adult acne. I discovered this years back before GM was even on Ulta, and it was so effective for such a great price. I'd forgotten about it, but re-bought recently because I've been breaking out, and I remember now why I loved this stuff. If you're super oily, it's a great lightweight moisturizer. If you need more moisture, it layers really well with additional serums and lotions. I like to combine with basic hyaluronic acid when I need moisture but don't want to make my acne worse.I have used this for about a month and it works for me and my skin. What I noticed was it works for my smaller, whitehead acne that is at the top layer of my skin and doesn't work for the deeper, larger ones so if thats your acne type this might not be for you. Also this is probably user error but it has a seal that you have to puncture with a point on the cap and it spilled out the top when I punctured it, again probably user error, but just a warning."

This is the only product that works for me so far as well as the peach slices cleanser combined.Hydrating moisturizer, however I have sensitive skin and after a few days of using the product my skin started to burn and get really red.soothing and hydratingi figured i would try this out because i have a lot of redness on my cheeks. it does help a little bit but for someone who has combination/ oily skin, i wouldn't recommend it. it leaves your skin feeling and looking super oily. i'll be sticking with my usual moisturizer!I work in a cooler all day and ive noticed over the past year that my skin stays red. Im not sure of its aging or the cold air or alittle but of both but so far ive been enjoying the calming cream. I haven't had any breakouts, I haven't seen a significant difference other then my skin feels hydrated throughout the day. Its only been a week though.This product is OK. It does help relieve redness. It's easy to use and has a gel-like texture. It doesn't have a weird or bad smell, which is a plus.  HOWEVER! It is greasy feeling on the face.  I have combo skin,  and in my dry areas this is NBD. but in my oily areas it is (to me) quite annoying. I bought this product to calm my irritated skin, as the product I went in to buy was OOS and I needed immediate relief.  I gave this 3 ð  because this may be great for some. just not me. I'll be ordering my usual product online and passing this on to my teenagerGrabbed this as i have redness and was in need of a new moisturizer. Price isnt bad! More of a gel like cream, which i enjoy. I dont really think this did much of anything for my redness, but was good for my dry skin- however, wont be a re purchase as i feel there are many better ones!"

It worked immediately and just zapped my dry skin issues. My friend, who has suffered from Excema for years saw her redness and itchy skin gone within days.Came back to do a review update because I'm on bottle 3 of this gem right now and I figured most reviews are done after a couple uses or a week of use. I like to read reviews after extensive use of a product. Okay so after bottle #2 I decided to branch out and try something new (I know we all do it!) so after almost 3 mths of using something else my face lacked it's glow and some of my hyperpigmentation returned around my cheeks and upper lip. I had managed to clear almost all of it up while using this! Stupidly I fell for a video of a different product and switched to it. I just went out and bought this again and already my face feels softer again and I know my hyperpigmentation will decrease again! I won't make that mistake again! This formula does not contain dimethicone which is important to me, I don't want a fake softness to my skin, I want a nourished softness. This is light and silky going on and even with dehydrated, dry skin I can skip a top moisturizer most days. The light smell goes away within seconds and does not bother me at all - strong botanical smells cause a migraine- lucky me! This is not a gel it is more like a serum texture or a light lotion texture, it sinks in pretty quickly. The bottle is glass and beautiful on my countertop, plus pump bottles are way more sanitary than droppers or jars. I appreciate a good pump bottle because I know when something comes with a spatula I'm using my fingers after about a week and a dropper always ends up touching my face or not sucking up enough product so I get mad at it! Come on beauty industry there is nothing wrong with a pump dispenser! Take note!!! I highly recommend this product and pray Lancome doesn't ever discontinue it! 
So if you have uneven tone, hyperpigmentation, dry and or dehydrated skin, aging skin, and dislike dimethicone you may love this formula!I have been using this product for several years. I began using it during a Summer because it was lightweight, and continued through the year.I have dry skin and this is a very light moisturizer. So, it's ok during summer, but as soon as it starst getting cold, I needed to double down. I like it's consistency, look and fragrance, but I don't think is worth the price.I wanted to like it because its lightweight but unfortunately its too light for dry skin.It makes my skin appear oily on my t-zone but still dry everywhere else. It doesnt help my combination skin. I usually mix it with one of my retinol serums to add a little moisture to it."

If I could return I would.Doesnt gove much coverage lile the ither color correcting products out there, but what concerns me is mine smells like a wet dog when i apply it every single time. I dont know if i have a bad batch, but the smell os so off putting that ive been avoiding using it at all.purchased product not realizing it was more makeup than moisturizer, color was very off putting against my very pale skin.  Maybe my product is expired or production is not consistent, straight out of the bottle product was separating horribly and liquid squirting everywhere.Not gritty or hard to apply. A little goes a long way.The product is green and acts essentially like a tinted moisturizer with a universal sage green that neutralizes red skin. Having tried the skin tint trend, I highly prefer this simple alternative for the clean girl look. I am blown away by the beautiful complexion and dewy results. Honestly not even sure how much I even use foundation or other complexion products after finding this!!!Ive battled redness from acne and roseacea for years.

The first time caused a burning sensation all over my face. I did try using it without any other skin care products, and the burning sensation continued. I stopped using it after the third day, it was irritating my skin way too much.
It did leave my face glowing but Obviously it is not worth the pain.I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this. I love FAB and I was excited to try this, but it's irritating. it stings when you apply it to dry areas. this may be good for oily types. but if your skin is sensitive I'm not sure if this is for you. I used it once and it was too much for me.I normally love First Aid Beauty products, mostly because they are unscented.

Never have reacted to any product and I have had success with neutrogena and other hydro boost products. This one is a no for me personally. Could not continue using knowing the burning allergic reaction/chemical burn feeling on my eyebrows specifically.This product is hydrating and does absorb into skin well if you rub it in well. It can look greasy and feel greasy because it tends to seperate in the bottle. It would be great but unfortunately it burns the heck out of my eyes, even when I try to avoid the eye area it still makes my eyes sting and water. It also taste like sunscreen. I dont put it on my eyes or lips but so how (maybe because its greasy and also bot sweat proof?) it makes its way to my eyes and lips. I will use it up but i wont buy it again.I used this product on my oily acne prone skin and have had no issues so far. I personally have been loving the entire skin care line and highly recommend especially for oily. I would suggest using the entire line of products together because they make for a lovely product combination that makes your face feel very clean and hydrated.Helpful to moisturize and sunscreen. Contains retinol as well. I would buy again.let me just say this.. it is not good in my opinion. theres no white cast so thats a benefit. but it broke me out so bad and made my current breakouts very inflamed, and made my skin red and itchy. when i went in the sun it made my skin burn.I was so excited initially because the idea of a moisturizer with spf 50 sounds amazing.

It has no white cast, a ton of supermoisturizing ingredients, and peptides that are ideal for my mid-forties skin - basically a way to get another serum into my skincare routine.

Discovered this SPF moisturizer when researching cruelty free, lightweight, more eco friendly options. I was previouslt using CeraVe daily moisturizer SPF 30 before, but needed a stronger SPF when I started using retinol at night. I also wanted an SPF that didnt pill on my skin and Pacifica Future Youth does not flake or pill! Overall very happy with this product. Priced well too when looking at similar cruetlty free/vegan options.I rand out of my korean spf so i had to look for alternative. Usally pacifica has really amazing SPF but this one was the only one at local ulta. It burns your eyes so avoid rubbing your eyes. It also burns my eyes when i cleanse my face. :/I used this product for about two weeks and within the first 7 days my skin became itchy, flaky, and dry. After week two I stopped using it and I'm back to normal. This also has a strong fragrance, smelled bad.This is a great moisturizer. I only gave 4 stars because for me it did feel greasy, although to be fair,  my skin is not super dry. It is great for being outside, as I went out in full sun and my face did not feel like it was drying out, but I probably won't be using it unless I need to. I also would not put makeup over it feels like it would just slide off. I would definitely recommend for someone with really dry skin though. The spf part works great and it also has a nice scent to it.  When you first put it on it does smell a little like sunscreen,  but then it goes away after a couple of minutes and just leaves a fresh scent, which was good for me since I do not like strong scents.I have normal to dry skin and this isnsuper glowy on me. Its like borerline greasy even when i use a little. It reminds me of the Naturium dew spf. If you like that then you'll like this. It does have a scent like a fake strawberry and floral scent. It's not the best but it doesn't really linger. Its super moisturizing and glowy. Not my favoorte but for someone with really dry or mature soin this would feel lovely.

I bought one for myself and one for my daughter-in-law's birthday.  Every product by this company is exceptional.  I hope that Ulta will carry a fuller line.  It outperforms everybody.Great product. Wish it had SPF in it. A little goes along way!Alcohol denat, fragrance and essential oils. Disaster ingredients in one bottle!"

I have tried a lot of soothing and calming products on the market to fix my occasionally irritated skin but so far this one is the only one that doesn't hurt when applied and that actually calms my skin down. I have used both its cream and balm version. They are both great but I like the balm one a little better.Glides onto the skin nicely and leaves a nice hydrated finish to the skin. Very soothing for dryness without clogging poresIn recent years i've developed excema on my eyelids, chin & ear lobes. I've tried so many moisturizers that claim to help reduce redness and lock in moisture, but it wasn't until I found this product that my skin changed for the better. I bought the 3 pack sample with the facewash and thermal water and fell in love with all. 

First purchased back in September 2022 & still using the same 3 products today. I even tried to change back to some old products that used to work for me and my skin returned to the brittle and scaly old self that used to be. I remain consistent with this brand, and they have shown me love back, my skin soaks this stuff in and doesnt break me out whatsoever. 

Super gentle and refreshing. One of my favorite pros is that it leaves my irritated and stinging skin, smooth and calm. if you have irritated skin that stings, even when you put your moisturizer on it, this product is definitely for you and will help with that sensation.This is my favorite Avene product! So much that I finished my first tube and bought two more! It has been very helpful for my dry face this winter and I love using it at night over my serums.Helped razor burn and is super gentleIt help relieve the redness on my irritated neck, little priceyThis moisturizer is extremely lightweight but really leaves my skin feeling hydrated!!!  I read reviews about how hard it is to use the dispenser, but I do have not had any problem with the pump working.  I will definitely be buying this again!"

The formula feels amazing in my skin, it literally feels so luxe. And there is noticeable difference to my skin. I'm actually obsessed!I have sensitive skin and unfortunately lots of water retention in my face due TO PCOS (moon face) I've really started to notice a difference with this product. Especially on a good night's sleep. But I love applying it before makeup. It makes my makeup so smooth looking and skin stays so soft.Not sure why its so difficult to find this product being a travel RN, but when I can find it in store I go for it!!  My skin is so sensitive and acne prone at 32 y.o and this is the best lotion I have ever had!This is a reslly nice moisturizer and gives a nice glow on my 43 yesr old skinI love this stuff. Twice while I was working someone complimented my skin. I was in complete shock bc I have a little acne scaring from when I was a teen, but it was bc the product made my skin plump, dewy and hydrated. I also love the smell!I just recently discovered this cream and don't want to be without it. Use it day and night. Feels great on my skin. This is my second purchase and will stock up next time I see it on sale. Please don't ever discontinue this marvelous cream!I've been using this cream for about a year.  I noticed tighter skin on my problem turkey neck almost right away.  Absorbs quickly and doesnt irritate my skin.  I use this as both serum and moisterizer. I dont find it drying at all.  Foundation goes over this well.  Love it!"

My skin still felt dry (and my skin tends to be on the oily side) and even seemed flaky sometimes. Im glad i got it got free because it is pretty expensive. I wouldve expected it to be higher quality for the price. Also, if you put any toners or serums on before it doesnt mix well or really absord into your skin.  It turns white and takes a while to fully rub in.I like this brand because it has good ingredients but this cream has a strange smell to it.  I want to say like a burning smell.  I prob will not purchase again. The price point is a bit highI tried this mousturizer as a day cream and bought the white 24/7 mousturizer as a night cream. My face was covered in tiny bumps (fungal acne? Dermatitis?). Absolutelt do not recommend, it didnt even leave me moisturized. I cut out this moisturizer and the night cream separately to see which was causing problems and they both did. I stopped using the products and the bumps went away.I used this produt for 4 days and got a rash all over my face, neck and up to my ears. I now have little bumps all over my face thats going to be a mission to get rid of.This moisturizer is does an all right job, I guess. It kind of smells like root beer, so that's not too bad. My one complaint, however, is that it leaves my face feeling sticky. I have to use a setting powder to abate that.I like Tula products and really wanted to try this one out. I've used the originally moisturizer before and had zero issues , but this one broke me out so bad - even with using a sunscreen as directed. Sorta bummed.The moisturizer works really well, but there's not much in it. It doesn't even fill up the jar half way. The way the container looks it appears that u get a lot, but not the case.

It's very similar to psoriasis, its all over my chest, back, neck and scalp. It is very painful at times and if i'm not careful i can scar from scratching too much. I have gone through lotions, serums, even vitamins I thought would help. This lotion was kind of my last hope before going back to the doctor. The first time i put it on, that was the first time in almost 2 years that my chest wasnt scaly, itchy and red. Theres a little discoloration from years of my skin dealing with this, but it actually looks like normal skin. This is a huge insecurity of mine and now i feel i can be ready for summer and actually wear things i want without feeling embarrassed!This is literally my favorite all over moisturizer!

It left dark spots on my skin due to burning. I couldn't put anything on for almost a week because it burned so badly. Definitely will not repurchase. I do love other products from Kiehls but this one isn't for me.I may simply be allergic to an ingredient in this moisturizer as it has many positive reviews, but it burns every time I apply. On a more positive note, I didn't experience any additional breakouts.In my personal experience (oily t-zone, sensitive dry cheeks) this moisturizer has been excellent. Even though its a gel texture, its shockingly soft and melts into the skin well, not getting that slight stickyness that some gel/oil-free moisturizers tend to have. Im able to use this on both the dry and oily parts of my skin and then I use their barrier repair cream on the drier/sensitive areas of my face and it feels downright refreshing. No irritation but also I dont feel like an oil slick after an hour! No greasyness but still effectively moisturizing, makinng my skin just feel supple and calm. I dont make a lot of money to buy ""luxury"" or just nicer skincare, but I will always splurge on this product as my go-to moisturizer.I love most Kiehl's products, but this one is the top go-to that's always on reorder. My skin is very oily so a good moisturizer is hard to find. This one is the best I've ever used. It sinks in beautifully and doesn't sit on top of the skin clogging pores. This is definitely not for people with dryer skin as it simply won't be moisturizing enough, but for those of us with oily skin it's a holy grail product.I love most Kiehl's products, but this one is the top go-to that's always on reorder.

I used a little on my cheeks and forehead.  It went on smoothly.  I liked the way it glided on my skin. I did notice that my forehead looked very shiny after a while and wiped off the product. When I woke up the following morning, my skin was picky and itchy/burnie.  My right eye was swollen on the lower inside lid.  I have a feeling I am allergic to something in this cream.  Will return and stick with non comedogenic creams.I bought this a couple of weeks ago after having run out of the Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream, and it has not disappointed! I am 35 years old with combination skin (oily t-zone, dry cheeks) and hormonal acne. I really liked the moisturizing quality of the Ultra Facial Cream, but it wasn't a friend to my oily skin. When I discovered Kiehl's made a formula of their popular product for people with oily skin, I decided to give it a try, and it's been a god-send. I use it day and night as part of my skincare routine, and it's a great compliment to my other facial products."

The worst thing is that throughout the day my eyes will start to burn. I've given it multiple chances to see if something else was causing this but without fail, everytime I wear it, my eyes will burn/sting (and this is not from the sunscreen getting in my eye directly).This is a thick moisturizer and doesn't spread well. Leaves a white cast.I usually get the regular ulta repair face moisturizer, which is my fav! Decided to try this one with the SPF, its decent however it irritates my eyes sooo bad which isnt great when you are getting ready to do your makeup and your eyes cant stop watering , and does leave a little bit of a white cast.I love this brand but thid product, big nope! Returning asapI dont like this product. I like tge moisturizer WITHOUT spf so i figured i try this one. Big mistake. After a few minutes it starts pilling, regardless of what if anything is underneath it. I end up washing my face again to get it all off instead.leaves a matte white coat, dries my skin out to the point where is flakey, dull and peeling, and it burns my eyes so bad.

The fact it contains the stable form of Vitamin C that most dermatologists prefer to recommend is of course THE reason to use it. I also LOVE that they didn't add fragrance to mask the  normal smell of the vitamin C ingredient. Yes, that odd ""hot dog?"" scent is just what the vitamin C smells like, and it dissipates in less than a minute.Bought this product about a month ago, I was worried at first about spending so much money, but it was time to drop the dime.

I do have sensitive skin and this seems to do the trick to balance pH levels. If you have tried other products with no luck, try this product. Not every product fits everyone but this one is definitely worth the try. To me... worth every centð'My daughter is 14 and this product has been great for her acneI love to try new products so I've experimented with a number of daily moisturizers with SPF like Drunk Elephant and Unseen Sunscreen and always come back to this Murad holy grail. It doesn't leave a white cast, is moisturizing, non-greasy, and doesn't pill under my makeup. I use this daily and a bottle lasts me roughly 4 months. I'm honestly shocked at other reviews saying they broke out as I have acne prone skin and never have but YMMV.This is a decent sunscreen, rubs in fine and makes my skin soft. However this burns my eyes soooo bad. Obviously I know to not get sunscreen in my eyes, but it doesn't matter how carefully I put it on, my eyes burn. I have very sensitive & dry eyes and it just doesn't work. The Tula one in the yellow bottle, is the one I continue to go back too.I was very excited to try this but was disappointed to find the results being similar to a drug store brand product not to mention this product caused my skin to break out and become oily. Never had those issues with my skin before starting to use this. Also the product just pours out of the bottle causing you to end up wasting product every time you use it which makes you run out a lot faster than you would expect.I have heard great things about Murad so I finally decided to treat myself to this moisturizer. I wanted to love it SO bad but my skin has BLOWN UP with acne so bad, it's starting to really get to me. I used to struggle with acne but it had gotten to be almost non-existed until I bought this. At first I thought my pregnancy hormones had caused my flare up, and it could be a contributor, but this is really the only new piece of my skincare regimen and it seems like others have had the same bad experience as me too. Will be throwing it away and buying my old moisturizer.As always, every experience can be different but I'll tell you mine: I have very sensitive skin , dry to normal, rarely have acne besides the occasional pimple. When I started using this, my face broke out like a crunch bar. TONS of bumps and several pimples. I started a new night cream at the same time so I wasn't sure, but as soon as I stopped using this my face cleared. It was pretty instant, at the end of the day the bumps were the worst and I would wash my face and wake up to no bumps (not what happens with typical acne). If you haven't heard of acne cosmetica, google it that way you can watch out for it with this product or any others. After looking closer I realized THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS SOME COMEDOGENIC INGREDIENTS (i.e. ethylhexyl palmitate)"

I figured it was from something else like perfume, but then I noticed smaller bumps on my face. I don't consider my skin sensitive so i am surprised. I wish this worked out.After having my baby, part of my postpartum recovery included extremely dry skin around my chin and T-zone area. It was SOOOOOO bad. My makeup application was the worst showing patchy skin. I tried so many things to help, including high-end luxurious products, but nothing worked until I tried this for weeks. I saw it changed the texture of my skin that included smoother and moisturized skin. I love it so much, I just bought a second one. The scent is also light. Nothing too crazy. This was good to my sensitive skin. Highly recommend!!!!This product did make my skin feel feel and look amazing.  However, it also caused acne breakouts that I hadn't experienced in many years.  For that reason, I can't use this product.  I wasn't prone to breakouts so it was a bit surprising.Smooth and penetrates well. Skin feels soft and smoothUsed 2 full bottles and feel very dry. Not the product for me.The concentration of alcohol in this is too high. It will create the ""tightening"" effect but that's actually the denatured alcohol sucking water out of your skin. Avoid this at all costs.I have sensitive skin so this product was not for me.  It irritates my skin."

The cream has a nice texture (feels like a water gel), no oiliness. It's so light and refreshing!! It has a mild lemony smell to it (not artificial), I have sensitive skin but it did not cause any irritation to my face. Having said that, I dont think this will provide enough hydration for dry skin..it absorbs quickly and gives perfect hydration for my oily skin. The tub is huge and will last me more than a year! glad I tried this product and will keep buying itIve been looking for a new day time moisturizer for a while and was between this an the cocokind texture smoothing moisturizer. I got the cocokind one and ultimately returned it and exchanged it for this one. I should have just gotten this one first! In ONE use my redness was dramatically reduced, my dry spots were gone, and any active acne was significantly less inflamed. The value of the product along with the amount that you get for the price is out of this world. It's comparable to the Laneige Water Cream (which is what I use at night) (I actualky think this is better than Laneigeâ¦) and only a fraction of fhe price! If you're considering this, just go for it!I picked this up for spring and summer and I'm in love. I have combo skin woth an oily t-zone and this is absolutely perfect for my skin. I love Korean skincare and I can't get over the amount you get for less than $20I've tried all the fancy overpriced moisturizers and this one beats them all. Also, a lot of the more expensive moisturizers have toxic chemicals and this one is CLEAN. This product is v moisturizing for my v dry skin and I decided to try it on my v dry lips as well and it almost completely cleared the chapped areas. Will be buying this product for a long time, but won't even need to do that often bc the larger bottle is huge.This is a first time writing a review for a product because i dont typically write reviews unless a product blows it out the water. This moisturizer is the best I've tried so far. Wasn't sure about buying it at first because of the price but you get SO much. It feels like it is actually soaking into your skin and hydrating. It doesn't leave a heavy greasy feeling. My pores get clogged easily and this product does not clog or cause me to breakout. Love it so much!Doesn't absorb into my skin and leaves my skin feeling very tight and dry.Ive been using this for a few months now and it works well with my combo rosacea acne prone skin. It is lightweight and sits well under most things. I use this in the morning with the tower 28 sos spray and Hero Cosmetics green sunscreen. 
You get a huge tub of this! So I definitely put it on my neck, chest, and shoulders after I shower. Works best on damp skin!"

However, it caused my skin to break out...bummer. I believe my skin can't handle the niacinamide. I had seen mixed reviews and gave it a try.My combo sjib drinks this up! My skin was breaking out abd dry from traveling. This was the only moisturizer that would soothe my skin without making it worse. Now that my skin has recovered it is my go-to.I prefer this over the other magic moisturizer from Charlotte Tillbury- this one is much more hydrating and easier to apply.let me start off by saying yes, the price is ridiculous. but if you can afford it and would really use it, it's so worth it. sits really well under my makeup and doesn't feel too heavy or thick on my skin especially because i'm oily. makes my skin feel really soft and smooth while keeping it hydrated. the hype is real!!Will update after i try under makeup but i purchased this on a friday and rarely wear makeup on the weekend.
The reason I purchased this was for the picture of the girl in display advertising that it diminishes redness. This seems to be making it worse x5. It has also been severly irritating my skin immenselyI was so excited to try this brand and this burned after application and turned my face red (I'm usually not THAT sensitive).

Bold statement to make to someone with psoriasis. Took the offered sample and used on the back of one hand. Within 20 minutes, it was as if all the moisture had been sucked out of that area and a fresh psoriasis patch began forming. ð Would probably never have purchased after the pushy salesperson, but absolutely will never purchase anything from this brand after the reaction.This is so hydrating and refreshing on my dry skin.Amazing product. Ive see dramatic change on oil production and pores . Love the idea it contains primer.This product unfortunately works really well. Everytime I internally hurl at the price tag and buy something else, my skin always breaks out. Not much but it's honest work.i loved this product but unfortunately after the first day of use it started burning when applying it :(This is not 1.7 oz.

I think I've finally found the perfect one ð absolutely shocked how good this looks under makeup. It makes your makeup flawless with a natural finish. I'm extremely picky and this stuff is the best.I love this sunscreen but why is it almost 30 dollars for such a small bottle? I love that this sunscreen doesn't peel and doesn't leave a white cast on my face but why so expensive?EVERY sunscreen breaks me out or itritates my skin, so im very hesitant to try new products. However, this sunscreen so far has not broken me out (a miracle). I do experience a very mild burning sensation on the delicate areas of my face, but nothing compared to other sunscreens. I also agree with another reviewer - this did cause some burning in my eyes.This sunscreen is light weight and goes on smooth. It comes in a cute bottle too! Butâ¦wouldnt recommend to wear on days you might sweat. It made my eyes burn a bit. Other than that, i like it!Ive struggled really hard in the past to get into using sunscreen everyday especially on my face because i would always break out from others. This one however is a game changer. The formula is super lightweight and does not clog my pores or cause me to break out. It soaks into the skin nicely so it doesnt leave a white cast and it feels good in my skin. It doesnt feel like im using sunscreen but like im using skincare products. It is worth every penny if you have problems with breaking out from sunscreen because this one does NOT.I really like this sunscreen. However, the price for 2.2 ounces isn't something I like. If you apply the amount of sunscreen you actually need to protect your skin from the sun, this little bottle will be gone in a couple weeks. I don't know if I'll repurachse it because of that.I've only tried this product a few times but I absolutely love how it feels on application and throughout the day. It doesn't pill or get sticky, and I love the greenish tint. I have to keep using it to see if it ends up breaking me out (most sunscreens do) but so far it's lovely to use! I don't dread reapplication!"

Love itMy skin feels smooth and moistureized.This is my night cream ever night.  It works, It does not irritate my skin. What's not to love about that?I received a sample of this and did wear sunscreen during the day. The first night it went on everything seemed fine. It went on with no problem. The second day I felt a little tight itching? By the third day I started seeing peeling around my nose and my face felt itchy and burny. Not an overwhelming itch but enough to recognize I'm having a bad reaction. Peeling, itching and a slight burning sensation. I didn't use makeup the first two days but when I put makeup on the third day, it went on blotchy and I could see the irritation on my cheeks, mostly below my eye area. I'm Pacific Islander, NC30 and in my 40's, sadly this product is not for me.Product is usually good. But got a bad batch and felt bad so I didn't bring it back.

But I like it as a quick little water cream to add to whatever else I'm using for the day. Smells delicious and love coconut so for me, this is a must have!This product is amazing, it's so light weight and smells amazing. Would definitely recommendi really loved the product and how it made my skin feel but i went thru the whole thing in one month!!! i can't be buying this every month for that price :/If you have acne or just skin in general you NEED this is in your life!I wanted to love this. The texture is great- very lightweight, dries nicely, and no stickiness, heaviness, dryness, or tightness on my skin after use! Unfortunately, on application, my skin immediately started stinging. I have some rosacea on my cheeks, and this moisturizer made it look and feel awful. The stinging stopped fairly quickly, but the redness persisted. I initially thought it could be from the combination of layering products, but I applied the moisturizer to a clean face with no other product, and it still stung and increased my redness. I have not had this issue with other FAB products- usually they play nicely with my skin type and other products in my routine- so I was very disappointed. If your skin is less sensitive, it might work well for you (again- great texture!), but given that FAB are the ""sensitive skin specialists,"" I have a hard time recommending it.I use this as part of my morning routine, it's the best moisturizer I've used. non greasy, easily absorbed, light and pleasant smell, doesn't get sweated out, and adds this layer of natural shine to the face.

Texture and smell are great, I have no notes. Can be used any time of year!The reviews fooled me again. I thought this was a lightweight moisturizer. It felt very heavy and greasy on my skin.

It's the only moisturizer that stays on my face at night abd doesn't transfer to my pillow. Great for night and day. Works for my combo skin.This is my dream moisturizer as someone with dry-combo skin with large pores. I've always loved the lightweight and bouncy feel of a gel cream, but never got any lasting moisturizing properties. Richer moisturizers did the job, but were both heavy feeling and we're not as satisfying of an application experience (I recognize the latter is totally personal preference, so they wouldn't lose points for that alone). THIS MOISTURIZER, THOUGH? Heaven, nectar, everything I want in a moisturizer including price point. On my days I laze around the house and don't go into the sun, I will wear this without sunscreen and my skin stays moisturized through the entire day.

Love that it isnt too heavy on my combo/acne prone skinI was hoping this product would work well on my acne-prone skin, but it doesn't seem to do much for me. It doesn't absorb very well into the skin so the more you use the more ends up sitting on your face. The claims about this moisturizer being pre-biotic don't seem to mean much.

They did work well on my smile lines and 11 lines but they just soften the wrinkles, my results only lasted about 1 week.

I cant use other moisturizers anymore because they clog up my pores.Best moisturizer.When I first tried this product, I hated the smell and didn't notice any advantage over my regular moisturizer. It went into my ""may try again in the future or when desperate,"" bag. About a year later, I did a light TCA peel. My skin is very oily/combo oily, and can handle a chemical peel well. Normally, I use a few very basic products post peel. We'll, a few days later, accidentally used my AHA BHA toner instead of my hydrating/calming toner. My skin went ballistic: inflamed, textured, and itchy. I immediately purchased a popular Barrier Repair moisturizer to help calm down my skin. All that moisturizer did was give me acne. Cue desperation. Into the bag I went. I found this CosRx moisturizer and gave it a try - first mixing it with pure aloe gel for a week, then using the moisturizer on its own for the next 2 weeks. When I tell you this saved my skin!! I've even used it on my eczema (neck down my skin is bone dry) and it's helping! I still hate the smell; however, this product is now a skincare staple for me."

No breakouts and i love it!So ive used almost the entire jar because hey it was an investment. The texture is similar to Neutrogena water cream, and acts the same. I bought this cream for its ingredients because i love anything with sea weed or algae. Its an ok cream for eveyday if you live in a mild climate, not for extreme weather. But upon applying to the face it smells so bad and that's saying a lot from because i lost my smell from covid. I can only imagine what others smellâ¦.. i wore this cream for a 14 hour work day outside in freezing weather and it did not protect or last very long. 
On s nomal day in more mild climate its ok. You only need a little bit otherwise it sits on the face snd takes time to absorb, on hot day you'll start sweating whike it absorbs , not cool. 
Overall I would not repurchase or recommend this product. I love Osea body products and the facial serum but this is a pass for me. Ill finish the jar for sure because im not going towaste, but will be adding face oil to protect in cold weather.This product literally burns my face, my face will get really red and hot to the touch. Not to mention the product just sits on your skin.I used this mainly on my neck because I wasn't sure if it would cause breakouts on my face. It has not caused any breakouts on my neck so I think it will be great on my face. I like it a lot it's nice.I have every other product of OSEA and love them. Bought this and the smell is nothing like their other products and first time using it, it burned instantly. Very dissatisfied and will not be buying this again .check other reviews; some say the same thing.I've heard great things about OSEA products so I decided to purchase this moisturizer as my first OSEA buy. I'm sadly disappointed. It didn't seem to have a fragrance when I smelled the tester in-store but when I apply it to my face, it smells like a musty, wet sponge.

A few years ago, I was able to clear up my skin with a strict morning and night routine that includes prescription creams, but every time I would try using SPF, I would immediately break out. I've tried dozens of prestige and drugstore brands! This moisturizer with SPF is the first that hasnt caused a single breakout. I've been using it for over a month now and I will continue to as long as its on shelves.This product is okay as a moisturizer and sunscreen but leaves you shiny looking. It also does not work well under makeup at all. I learned the hard way after I was almost completely done with my makeup and it began lifting and leaving ugly peeling patches when i used a powder brush. For the price, theres way better sunscreens out there. The murad sunscreen in a blue bottle is about the same size and the same price but works amazing.I switched to this sunscreen and my pores and oily skin were controlled also my skin felt amazing! I could t rebuy it because I was pregnant but whenever I get my hands on this again I would gladly stick to this only. The only con is the size and priceI wanted this to work for me but it kept making me break out after a week of use. Every day I had new pimples showing up. Other than that, I like everything else about it. It absorbs well and is easy to apply. It doesn't leave a white cast or smell like sunscreen. My face felt moisturized throughout the day and the SPF is good. Just wish it didn't cause acne!This is the first product with sunscreen that doesn't break out my sensitive skin. Really like how is makes my skin glow after application. My makeup application is great not cakey and doesn't move around my foundation or concealer.I have super oily skin so finding a daily moisturizer has been a struggle. This was recommended at the store and I'm SO in love with it! The texture is perfect and it keeps me matte throughout the day. And the SPF is a huge bonus!"

Recently I bought a $150 moisturizer claiming it was magic, when THIS..PUR Cloud Cream (for a fraction of the price)..was all I've ever wanted and needed. It is the silkiest product and it just melts into the skin like a drink for your pores. I mix it with a dab of Charlotte Tilbury ""beautiful skin"" foundation and I feel like a million bucks. Immediate confidence boost. It's just enough tint to perfect the redness from my acne and scars...and it leaves the most gorgeous finish, like I just got back from the medspa and my skin is plump, hydrated, and GLOWING. I got this as a sample from Ulta and I had to come back here, buy the full size immediately, and leave a review. I knew nothing about it so when I searched it up I was expecting this to be much more expensive. A double win for it's attainable price!! Please never discontinue.I am allergic to tocopherol acetate, and this is the only moisturizer I can find at Ulta without it. Thank goodness it works well. Feels nice, not greasy. Absorbs quickly, and isnt strong smelling.This is one of the only things I can use on my face! I dont have to worry about my face sweating when
I wear it. It is lightweight and is scent free!Okay so. I have extremely finicky, super sensitiveGr, combination skin. Ive tried lots of moisturizer brands such as Clarins, CosRx, Drunk Elephant, and Beauty Counter. As great as they worked, my skin sucked up the creams too fast and didnt last me throughout the whole day. Serums helped, but would cause me to break out in consistent trouble spots. The way it sat on my skin did NOT feel even. Rough versus smooth. And when using foundation, you could see the different textures. 

Since using PÃ¼r Cloud Cream, I can honestly say this is one of the most amazing products Ive ever tried?? 
When applying, a little is a lot. It smoothes out so evenly, feels cold and refreshing right off the bat. I let it sit about a minute or two, did a test feel of my skin. Let me tell you, the texture was IMMEDIATELY consistent over my whole face. Trouble areas such as the nose, above my lips, smile lines, and eyebrows were rich and hydrated. Im actually kind of shook how quickly, too.

When using foundation, it gave an airbrushed feel and look. My skin still felt smooth! And was definitely still hydrated. 

So excited for trying this product. Will DEFINITELY buy it again.Lightweight and goes on smoothLove this for my acne prone skin, it soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated. Not oily and clogged at all like some moisturizers.All of the PUR products have been really nice for my dry, sensitive skin. These have become holy grail products for me over the last year."

Great product!Truly oil free. I have oily skin so I can immediately pick up on oily products. Very light weight and good texture. Best I've used so far.Great productI had started using the Bareminerals Skin Longevity line but didn't quite care for the daily moisturizer with sunscreen so I bought this product.  I am 60 yoa and have struggled with acne and skin problems since I was a teenager.  I believe it's mostly due to bad genes because my sisters and daughter also had acne problems. This moisturizer absorbs well, but because it is oil free, it doesn't leave my skin shiny or greasy looking. It makes my skin feel fresh and smooth. I do not look my age and I believe that using these Baremineral products contribute to my better looking skin.I use this daily after cleansing. It is light-weight but easily covers my face & neck. It isn't oily at all. I have used other products in the past. They cause breakouts and leave my face feeling greasy all day or soak in immediately & don't create a good foundation.Best moisture I have ever used. A little goes a long ways.  My skin has never felt or looked this good. Absolutely love this product.  Please don't ever stop selling this."

I noticed how smooth, how easy to smile it was, and what a big difference it was from the previous years. Using the whole set it's very expensive but if you are careful and use them as indicated they last.  I bought mine on October 2022 and run out of them in February 2023 bravo!!!  And that was because I had to travel to different countries so I ended taking small amounts in my containers when I when to Europe. Then on my way back I travel to Mexico so I took all the bottles because I was going to stay there 3 months. Then my set got finished there   I checked in the fine stores in Mexico but there were no Refills so I had to I'm wait till I return to USA to buy them. I'm strongly recommending the LancÃ´me Absolute products they all wonderful! Use them carefully and daily!I love this product, and I've tried quite a few high end moisturizers. I'm 52 a post menopausal. I only gave it 4* because of the price, and the fragrance.  Most over the age of 50 will likely remember a bottle of White Shoulders sitting on their grandmother or mother's vanity, and that's what the smell of this cream reminds me of. Very floral and not just roses. I can live with the price, but I would definitely give it 5* if LancÃ´me would make a fragrance free version. The fragrance doesn't linger, but the smell reminds me of what old women smelled like when I was a child."

Absolutely love the feel and smell of this. Face never felt so soft.i went into ulta wanting to buy the first aid beauty moisturizer but it was sold out. one of the employee's recommended this one to me and i figured id give it a try since neutrogena discountinued my normal moisturizer and i needed to find a replacement. its been like 2 weeks and im honestly not that impressed by it. for the price, i was expecting more but i still woke up dry a couple nights and my face doesnt feel as hydrated as i would like. it didnt break me out though and it doesnt make my skin oily so those are some good things about it.Omg the design, so nice. Pink with a shiny white lid, looks imperical. And the box it came with, bright red inside. You just want to open it and use it right away. I used it as a mask, love love love.

I've tried everything to get rid of strawberry legs n old eczema bumps on the back of my arms and after about a week both are gone. 
the smell fades as soon as its dry N doesn't clash w/perfumeAHA works wonderfully effective but gentle for my dry and sensitive skin. This is my go to body lotion. A little sticky when first applied but in a while it gets absorbed into the skin. The smell is acceptable to me after long term use. I guess that is a price you pay for the results like any other effective ingredient. So happy Ulta is carrying my favorite body lotion now!!!Yes this does have a certain smell to it, but compared to how effective it is, ill deal with the smell. It disappears quickly. This has completely transformed my pre-teena acne covered back. I wish they made a face product as effective, but this is too strong to use on your face. HG product at our house.It amazing its been few weeks i had this big dark spot in my legs i been using this product its fading away.I have only used the product twice.

This is like a light watery lotion but absorbs like a rich cream. It soaks right in and paces a velvety, supple feeling that I love. Sometimes my skin is drier so I could see me being able to use this during the day also without being too heavy. It does have a scent. It's like candy strawberry and flowers. It's light and goes away very shortly. You only need a little of this because it spreads so well. It can be easy to go overboard. I think this is definitely worth the money given the ingredients, packaging and how long this will last. Especially compared to other creams. I don't breakout but wake up with super soft, nourished skin.I want to love this product so badly but the fragrance/essential oils in this caused my eczema to flare up. I'm so sad but I know it's on me for buying something with fragrance, natural or not.

If i dont shake it i can see the oil.I bought this sunscreen on accident because I thought it was a free gift and didn't check until I picked it up in store. However, I decided to use it because I needed a new sunscreen and surprisingly, this worked very well for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it sits on top of my other skin care products very well. This is also the first sunscreen that hasn't irritated my skin or burned my eyes which I truly appreciate because every sunscreen I've worn in the past had an extremely painful reaction on my eyes. I plan on repurchasing.I use this product for daily use. It is lightweight and keeps your face clear and oil free.i'm so glad i found this sunscreen! beginning with the biggest pros for me- i've seen no new breakouts, doesn't pill, and feels like nothing on my skin. i really hate when i can feel an spf on my face but with this product my skin feels light and clean. pilling and clinging to dry patches is very annoying and i've noticed ZERO pilling/exaggerating of dry patches. 

the few cons i have are very nitpicky- fairly strong smell and isn't mattifying. the smell is almost floral but mostly is just a normal sunscreen smell, which isnt a huge deal to me but might be too much for those sensitive to fragrance. i also wouldn't consider this a mattifying products which i actually prefer. theres little to no added shine but again, not very mattifying.

overall i'm so glad i finally found an spf that works on my skin!Considering I have very oily skin, this didnt moisturize my skin at all. I had to use it as a straight up sunscreen over my regular moisturizer which defeated the purpose for me. It was defined mattifying to the point of drying.I do my best to avoid sun exposure to my face, so I am always applying sunscreen. This works really well, it's not runny like some other suncreens for your face and I like the way it smells. I feel that it works really well and don't notice any redness or irritation eithet!I didnt like this at all! It leaves my skin so oily. It also feels very heavy. The only pro about this is there is no white cast."

But when i wake up in the morning my chin and forehead is covered in bumps and white heads. I love the glow it gives, but not all the texture. Ive also found that it makes me skin almost feel ""sore"". Like when i touch my skin it kind of just hurts. Ill definitely be going for a different toner.Using as directed, this causes significant irritation after a couple applications. I've been able to avoid the irritation by applying it with a cotton pad once a day after cleansing, but, after regular use over a few weeks, I can say definitively that this is causing breakouts where I don't notmally get them. It's such a shame because it really does give my skin a lovely, healthy glow.This toner has quickly become one of my skincare staples, and as soon as I stop using it I notice a huge difference in my skin not looking as hydrated and glowy. Since using this, I get so many compliments on the natural glow of my skin (and it was the only product I changed in ny routine). 

I am begging BEGGING, that this is released in a larger product size soonI just love this toner. I have bought it multiple times and will continue to.

I love the smell and milky hydration it leaves on my skin. It's clean skincare and is such a great value. I highly recommend!This is the perfect toner and literally found it go viral on TT.

It finally erupted into hives on the 3rd day. Everything irritated my skin after using this. Do not try this product if you have sensitive skin. Opt for Dermalogica.New formulation is terrible. 
I've been using this moisturizer for years! I always get compliments on my skin, it's been my go to forever. I even mix a little of it into my foundation the past few years when i want a more sheer coverage. 

They changed the formula and this one is not a winner. It instantly pills. Doesn't absorb. Right after putting it on, my face feels dry. I am so so disappointed and on the hunt for a new moisturizer.I love this whole positively radiant line from the cleanser to the gel moisturizer it's all very good and didn't irritate my very sensitive skin which the oat line meant for sensitive skin, did. this is my favorite stuff.NOT a fan of the new formula. It smells like tart green apple candy and feels greasier/sitting on top of my skin. I'm also annoyed they are branding this like it's the same old formula just in updated packaging when it is definitely not the same product anymore. I compared them directly and the percentages of ingredients are different, and the new product is a lower weight. I wish they acknowledged/provided reasoning for the changes, otherwise I have to assume it's now a lower quality product and a victim of shrinkflation. I will be changing to a new daily moisturizer.I have used this product before and it had never happened.I have used this moisturizer or the spf 15 version for at least 10 years. I will not be repurchasing after trying the reformulation. It applies OK, but it starts to pill badly after a few hours, even with no makeup on, which the old one never did"

The only sunscreen I will ever use!I wanted a moisturizer that also had sun protection but I feel like what I got was just sunblock. It smells to high heaven like nasty sunblock! If I wanted to smell like sunblock then that's what I would have purchased.
It has the smooth cloud feel but that is the only good thing about it.The first time I tried to take this on a trip, the travel size plastic packaging brokeâthe plastic seems really fragile. First the lid split, then the plastic near the pumpâ¦ the product inside is nice and lightweight.The price is outrageous! Got the small size to try, and couldn't believe how quickly it was gone. The packaging on the smaller size is also frustrating  - there's  definitely some left in there, but no way to get to it. I use this for my hands in the car, and love that it doesn't leave a greasy, heavy residue. But not sure I can abide by the price.No matter how careful i am to not get near my eyes, it still stings.

You can also get this product in their acne clearing kit, along with a foaming face wash and spot treatment. Love it!Got this moisturizer as a wake me up for the cooling effect, but the amount of product doesnt even cross the verticle E in ""clear"" written on the front of the bottle. Highly disappointed because had i noticed before using it, I would have returned it.As someone that's been struggling with finding a good moisturizer for my oily skin I am very impressed I struggle with oily skin so bad and it his moisturizer doesn't leave a shine and controls the oil :)The only thing I really dislike is the scent I cannot figure out what it smells like (I've read the ingredients it's a lot of flowers) but I hate it. Other than the scent it's really helped my skin, I have oily/combo, it absorbs really fast, a tiny amount goes a long ways!I just want to start by saying, I've never had a moisturizer that has ""wowed"" me before. This still isn't that, but it's the closet I've got. My initial response was, ""this is really silky!""âand it is! It is a bit tacky while drying, but nothing horrible. Now the scent is a bit on the strong side. I normally am okay with floral scents, but this one is a little too much. Nothing that would make me wash it off, but I don't prefer it. The reason it's great for my very oily, acne-prone skin is that it doesn't leave me with that gross, greasy effect I get after using most cream moisturizers. However, if you have dry, acne-prone skin, I do not recommend this gel moisturizer. (Check out Tatcha's 'The Dewy Skin Cream' moisturizerâthat one works great for my skin when it gets dry in the winter.) I am greatly appreciative for this moisturizer this summer, hopefully it continues pairing well with my CeraVe products, so I can continue using it!This is a wonderful light moisturizer. It doesn't make your skin feel oily or greasy, I noticeably don't have odors or residues that make me love this stuff, and more on this winter, gifted by dermalogicaI received this moisturizer complimentary from Dermalogica (ULTA Team). It has fragrance in it so it might not be suitable for sensitive skin. I love the texture of the gel, but I did not notice any cooling effect on my first application. I put the gel in the fridge the next day and it felt much better on my skin.  It is very light-weight and it did not leave my skin sticky.

I love that it is cruelty free and has vegan collagen. I love that it has SPF 30, a must for me, BUT it smells like sunscreen. It is definitely moisturizing, I don't have an issue with dry skin, BUT it's rather greasy. My daughter has even commented that my face is really greasy when I wear it (not really the vibe I'm going for). The chemicals burn my eyes as the day goes on. If I even wipe my eyes, it takes me minutes to wipe away whatever traces of this moisturizer is around my eyes. If I regularly wore makeup, this would be extra problematic. If you wear contacts, I do not recommend this. Imagine that burning getting caught up under your contacts.

I really, really wanted to love this because I didn't want to go through having my skin adjust to a new product, but I can't justify it based on it being a habit.As mentioned by others, this would be more accurately described as ""SPF 30 sunscreen with collagen."" Smells exactly like a normal drugstore sunscreen. It's light and doesn't feel too greasy (but there is still a bit of that feeling). Overall it's okJust finished my bottle and ordered another one.  I have sensitive, adult cystic acne, 44 yr old skin that is in the normal to dry stage. This product:
1) has a sunscreen like feel to it when you first apply it, then it fades away
2) has a great glass bottle that you can get ALL of the product out of!
3) Spreads well- at little goes a long way- to much will make it sticky and it won't dry down fast
4) plays well with Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid serum and PUR love your selfie foundation.I'm getting older, and my skin is changing, and I hate it. My old favorite daily moisturizer/SPF by No. 7 started making me breakout after years of no problems, so I had to search for something new. All the others I tried that claimed to not clog pores also happened to be too drying for my slightly oily but aging but still acne prone and also kinda dehydrated skin (ugh). But the moisture level of this Goldilocks cream is just right. If you have dry or slightly dry skin you will probably like it, if you are 40+ you will probably like it, if you're young and have oily skin you might NOT like it because it is not a light liquid, it's definitely a thick-ish cream. I can tell the fragrance they were trying for was *floral* but it leans more chemical, although it disappears in a minute or two. After application the skin feels moist, but not greasy. Makeup applies perfectly over it with no pilling at all. I somehow manage to not look shiny over the course of the day, which is practically miraculous. It doesn't seem to make me break out, as I've been using it for several weeks with no notable flares. I am relieved to have found my new favorite!i like how this spf does not leave a white cast like other spfs. Plumped my skin right up and gave it a nice silky glow.Love the fact its a moisturizer and has spf. Its easy to use and dont need as much since it spreads easily on your skin. I can feel it last for a good amount of time tooI have very sensitive skin and pretty much every facial spf I have tried has burned my face to the point of peeling.

It does nothing for my skinâ¦ super greasy, no firming, and makes my skin look worse. For the price I expected at least a decent product. In my opinion there are SO many great moisturizers out there that out perform this and are cheaper.Bought this because I like the day cream version a lot.  This however was just not a great formulation for me.  It simply NEVER absorbs into my skin and then it just rubs off on my pillow case or hands eventually.   And I don't use an excessive amount because of the price tag.  I'm a big fan of using the minimal amount required.  It's too late to return it, so it's just going to move into my graveyard of products that I can't bare to throw away because, $$$, but just don't work on my skin.  Le sigh.  But, I still love the extra firming day cream and all my other Clarins products.  I would recommend trying a sample of this before buying if possible so you know if it's a good consistency for your skin.Excellent result ðLight weight, non greasy.  Plant enriched.  Vegan.

I am now 26.This stuff is GOLD. I had never used retinol and read that a small percentage is the best way to start and wow. Every night I put this on my skin is instantly dewy, glowy, and looks so fresh. It's been a game changer in my skin care routine"

Its The Only Toner I Go Back To Because In Its First Use You Can See The Dirt That Is Removed From Your Face & In Every Use. You Can Visually & Physically Feel/Tell The Difference When Using This Product. I Like To Add Some Into A Spray Bottle & Then Remove Excess With A Cotton Pad. This Also Helped Me Years Back When I Was Having A Long Going Acne Breakout. I Have Not Had Any Problems With This Product & Will Continue Using.I did not find this product to be soothing. Instead of reducing redness it seemed to make my skin more red. It left my skin feeling sticky instead of moisturized. My skin is a little sensitive, but i dont usually have to stop using products without finishing them.I have mild rosacea. I am not consistent in my skincare routine, I will get some surface acne.   I implemented it into my current routine and used it consistently for 3 months. After about 6 weeks, I tried some variations to ensure that there wasn't interaction with what I was using. It did not exacerbate redness or irritate; however it also, did nothing else. The earthy smell dissipates as it dries. Nothing changed  I would not waste my money in the future on this particular product.I have rosacea and this product helps to soothe redness and prevent further reactivity. It feels good on the skin and smells great.Its so expensive, i wish it wasnt worth it. But it is! This makes my dry, sensitive skin so smooth and hydrated. 10/10.I hope this product works for a lot of people. I have been searching for some thing that would help calm my angry skin. This has worked very nicely so far I've use this after I shaved my face, and it worked better than Proraso after shave.  I know everybody's skin is different so it may not work for you but coming from someone who has tried a lot of products. This is the one that has finally worked for me. I'm excited to try the moisturizer next.I can't handle the odor of the Mega-Mushroom Relief and Relience Lotion.  May need to look gif a product from a different company."

Absolutely not worth the price point. There are more hydrating options out there.I have dry, sensitive skin & this cream has been a game changer for my skin. I love that this balm doesn't have shea butter like most balms because i suffer from acne & cannot use that ingredient on skin. This cream has cleared my acne (i assume because it has salicylic acid) & my skin just looks & feels so much healthier. I love it so much, but like someone else said in the commentsâ¦I wish they made a bigger size because i go through this stuff so quick since i use it day & night.I have extremely dry skin. It's very sensitve and reactive due to an autoimmune disease. I can use hardly anything on my face. I use and like the Kiehl's cica but thought this would be better with the colder temps now. It's not. Skin is dryer and I can tell my skin barrier is unhappy now. It reminds me of using body lotion on your face (which I've tried a few times) it leaves a chalky matte finish too. Not good for my middle aged skin. 
Their Cica cream is far superior and so is anything by Ursa Major for all you out there with unhappy dry skin. This doesnt cut it as a facial lotion.This is vry healing on my dry skin. It gave me a couple of whiteheads on my face, but I noticed that it really calmed the redness. It's a trade-off. I would rather cover a pimple with a little makeup rather than cover up the redness all over my face.It's fine. It didnt do much for my chronically dry skin. My face actually looked a little worse the next day. However, my neck and upper chest were improved after one use. It's now my neck/chest cream and i'll stick to an oil on my face.I received this as a free gift with purchases of other products and fell in LOVE. I have super dry, sensitive, and itchy skin. Texture is also a big thing for me. I cannot do the oily and thick feel. I'm the same with body lotion, if it is too oily, or I can feel it on my face, ICK! This was perfect. Perfect coverage, light 'non-scented' smell was great. You know how some products advertise the non-scented and it smells awful?? Not this. I can't explain it. I am going to bite the bullet and purchase a full size; it looks kind of small for the price, but I am willing to pay if it helps me get some relief!I have rosacea and very sensitive skin. Nothing has ever made my skin feel as calm and hydrated as this product. Not even prescription products from the dermatologist. The downside is that I have to apply THREE thick coats for my skin to not feel kinda tight. Its like my skin  just drinks this stuff up like crazy! I end up going through a tube in just less than a month, which is gonna get kinda pricy, but my skin is feeling better for it."

My 33 year old skin looks phenomenal! It's so moisturizing and soft on my skin with a beautiful glow.Easily the BEST anti-aging deeply hydrating moisturizer I've ever used!!!! I've not only purchased the entire live for myself but family members and it's worth every penny. A LITTLE goes a long way!The best face cream I have ever used.This face cream was so expensive and I felt it didn't work for me. It made my face very sensitive and my foundation didn't stay well on top it. I was disappointed but will try something new.I am loving the results of these products.I've tried MANY MANY moisturizers. this one is THE BEST hands down! Use it day 1 and your face feels like a babys butt the very next day. That's how fast and amazing this stuff works. Nothing will make your skins feel this soft and supple. And no breakouts! (a few moisturizers make me break out for some reason but not this) The only downside is the price; it's horrendously expensive so I hafta wait until my bday & xmas gift cards and rewards points to buy it so I only buy it about once a year. A little goes along way so I can make it last a few months. I'm 56 with normal to dry skin.I have used it for a week now. Like the way my skin feels I use it at night. Packaging is a little over the top. Contents is a lot smaller than it appears from the outside.

My tinted serum lays flawlessly on my skin and doesnt get shiny throughout the day. Never going back to any other moisturizer.Its not greasy, its a moisturizer. A little goes a long way. It does not clog my pores. I cleanse, tone, serum and then use this product to moisturize. It even recommends to use after using vitamin C and I hope you follow up with sunscreen. Smells like shea butter.Just what I needed. Very moisturizing. My face use to dry out a lot. But this cream has fixed that.Very moisturizingWay too thick, oily  and smelled strangely.

It feels so noce on thw skin ita a gel like texture so it feels lightweight. Makes my skin so soft, the tingling takes time to get use to but it's amazing!Fantastic product. 
I keep it in the fridge, feels simply amazing when you put it on, especially in the morning around the eyes. 
will ABSOLUTELY buy again.I bought this on a whim ans was pleasantly suprised with how it worked. The cooling sensation was quite nice and makeup applied over it just fine. Im looking forward to using this in the summerFreezer is a cooling gel cream that can be used as a primer and/or just a moisturizer that makes skin look smoother.  It has a cooling sensation, though not overdone, that makes you and your skin feel refreshed and revived.  It absorbs nicely into the skin, not too greasy, with a lightweight feeling.  I'm older and tried some Freezie on my hands, as well -- and love it!  It smooths out little wrinkles on my hands and fingers, making them look more youthful, kind of like a nourishing hand mask for your hands.  I'm keeping some jars of Freezie on hand from now on!feels more of a primer then a moisturizer, it DEFINITELY feels cooling. A little too cold for my personal preference. I foud it more usefull for priming before makeup! I LOVED the way my makeup looked with it! completly blurless!Basically does what it's supposed to do & does it well.

I cant wait to try the rest of the Juice beaty line! Thanks for keeping it organic.I really like this combo moisturizer by Juice Beauty. I've been trying to 'multitask' my products to minimize the layers I put on my face everyday. This moisturizer dries to a sheer glow and doesn't remain too tacky. It doesn't pile under makeup and the fragrance is super light. Will buy again!I love how it doesn't leave that white look on my face since it contains SPF. It makes my skin feel hydrated and bright.It's not absorbed no matter what and smell is terrible! So very disappointing...It caused me to break out into hives and caused a severe allergic reaction. Which ultimately resulted in a severely damaged skin barrier.I'll buy this again because it's vegan, etc., but it does have a tiny odor. for me it goes away quickly which isn't an issue and I somewhat expect that from more natural products. it felt as though my skin couldn't really breathe, but I'd rather have more moisture than not enough. all in all it's nice and a great recommendation. it doesn't pill under makeup and adds a very slight glow."

I do like it, I can feel how it seems to be tightening my skin.. But, i havent noticed any difference. I have noticed at the very top where my hair line is, it gets super dry. I am not sure if it is the moisturizer or what but i have tried several different shampoos and conditioners and still have the problem. But i havent tried a different moisturizer yet. The smell does not bother me, it does smell good. I do feel like it isn't as moisturizing as it should be thoughâ¦ I really wish I could find the old Chanel Hydra Micro Creme! 

Honestly, I believe this moisturizer just depends on your skin type. I use it with my Chanel foundation.. I am still iffy about it because I feel like it also shows my ""fine lines"" more but I am not very good with all of this anyway. LolI unfortunately have sensitive skin, I find the fragrance to be irritating on me. Plus I have a bit of a break out coming in from hormones. I've been trying it for a while, I really wanted to love it.Best product ever.The No 1 Chanel line is phenomenal. I have 3 products now and will continue to add more. This is just what my ""mature"" skin needed. 
Thank you Katarinaâ¦Chanel and Ulta are lucky to have such a professional, knowledgeable and kind associate!I got this as a sample and I immediately bought it once it ran out. I live in the desert so my skin gets really dry with the weather here, this moisturizer has been the only thing that's been able to hydrate my skin without leaving it greasy and my pores look like they're getting smaller. I'm pretty selective when it comes to spending money but this was well worth it.I tried this in the store on the back of my hand and could instantly visibly see a difference in my skin texture. I am NOT a $115.00 facial cream buying type of woman but the next month I just had to have it and never felt a bit of guilt on this splurge.Not sure if I'll repurchase because the price tag on this is not really sustainable. With that being said, this is an excellent moisturizer. I think it's a little too thick to wear under liquid foundation but I'll definitely wear for night cream."

it on the counterI had received a sample of this. It sat with my other samples for awhile, and one day I tried it. From that day on I was hooked! Put on after cleansing, serum, moisturizing, and spf. It makes a great primer before makeup, or you can use it for no makeup days as a beautiful finish that leaves bare skin glowing. I bought the full size after I ran out. Definitely worth the cost!! Love this!I got a sample from a advant calendar around Christmas and became obessed. I love this. It looks so good alone. I can throw this on and some mascara and im out the doorI would definitely buy this again if it didn't pull up. But it pills and it appears my skin is peeling but it's the product.I received this product in a monthly subscription box and was so excited to try it. Unfortunately this made me break out horribly, my skin was constantly breaking out while using it. This did look very pretty alone as it had shimmer but I think the shimmer was causing the breakouts. However I also started to notice that after a while of using it, my face would sting whenever I'd put it on. The moment I switched moisturizers, my skin fully cleared up. I really wanted to like this because it made my makeup looked nice, but my skin was not a fan /:This makes my foundation patchy. It doesn't do well with foundation at all. I'd recommend alone for a no makeup day but that's about it. I got this in a box for free and I probably won't ever use it again. Super disappointed."

Feels like drinking a cold glass of water on a hot day. My skin drinks it up. After several weeks of using, my face is smoother, more evenly toned, and brighter. I REALLY like this product!I am approaching forty and did not wear sunscreen daily when I was younger. This has dramatically improved my dark spots and smell amazing. I need one pump for my whole face. It is too harsh to use daily on my neck so it's definitely trial and error. I will be buying again!So I tried this out for 4 days as recommended. Did fine until 4th day. My face is burning itching red and irritated. May be my skin type. But I have a waisted my money and I'm very upset.I used this for a solid week, and my face got so dry. I'd wake up with flakey white patches on my face. I've been moisturizing my skin 3-4x a day to help clear this dry skin up.I'm a combination type of skin and I do not have acne. I'm going to try for 2x a week once my face clears up. If you already have dry skin, I would not recommend. Other than that, it's good on my neck and don't recommend on or near sensitive skin on the face like eyelids."

This product does not dry out my skin but I do have oily skin . I do also use a face cleanser that's why I rated this a four star.After 1st small application my face began to burn. I had to wash it off. Returned it to the store. This one is not for me but Olay doesn't make it easy to know which one of their products to use.I purchased this moisturizer from Ulta and it arrived within a few days. I use the product both morning and evening even if I am supposed to only use it once a day. My skin appears brighter and it is definitely smoother. I even use it on my neck but so far I haven't noticed a difference there.This smooths my face and doesn't cause breakouts which so many moisturizers do. I haven't found a moisturizer yet that doesn't break me out. It lasts all day and works well underneath your makeup or by itself. I definitely plan on continuing to use this.A couple months back I went on vacation to the Bahamas where my skin ended up breaking out very badly.  I brought this moisturizer with. It felt like my face was burning off and every time I took a shower more skin peeled off my face. It was the most miserable time ever. I assumed it had something to do with the trip. A couple days ago I tried this product again, the next morning the same thing happened, immediately this time. My face is burning, feels hot to the touch, bright red and is breaking out with little bumps all over and starting to do that gross oozy thing again. Now I realize it's this moisturizer. It might be awesome on some, just not me. I really wanted to like this product but I wouldn't wish this horrible reaction on anybody. So I guess just be cautious and if you notice something doesn't feel right, stop using it immediately.This stuff isnt just great for your face, but can work on other sensitive areas too.

I seen influencers use so much product but I seriously use one pump and thats enough. Wears well under makeup as well as the LaRochePosay spf. I highly recommend. The ingredients alone are phenomenal!This moisturizer leaves the skin glowy and plump looking exactly as advertised! If you don't already have oily skin it may feel a little too lightweight; I have acne-prone combo skin and find myself wishing it were SLIGHTLY more hydrating however it hasn't caused any more acne or sensitivity and seems to agree with my skin. On days where I feel extra dry I've been applying a thicker moisturizer on top and I haven't noticed any pilling.I love this moisturizer. I hate the bottle it comes in. I can appreciate some beefy, luxe-feelin' packaging as much as the next guy, but this heavy, thick glass bottle makes it a stupid hassle to use the second 50% of the product inside it. I don't need my ultra-lightweight moisturizer to come in a bottle so hefty and chunky that it would make the best choice for an improvised weapon of any product in my daily skincare routine.I have been looking for a good lightweight moisturizer. Ive never tried peach and lilly before but let me tell you this is it! My moisturizer before had left a bit of a film after applying. And my skin would be dry by the end of the day.

I tried multiple products that left my skin feel and greasy and heavy, But this product was a lifesaver.  It's lightweight but very hydrating.  I can't wait to try the daytime, cream and face washI've used this product for 2 months now and haven't noticed ant differences in my skin. I was looking forward to the green tea and ceramides ingredients in it. The texture of the moisturizer is fine. Not super thick and not too thin. I have oily skin and it doesn't make me breakout or anything. Just not seeing the results I anticipated. I'd rather use the Olay's regenerist lines or Peach & Lily's matcha pudding over this where I can really see a daily differenceUsually healing my skin barrier means putting up with a week+ of slathering my face with a thick moisturizer or balm. As someone with sensory processing issues, I hateee feeling residue from those products on my skin, especially when going to sleep (iykyk)

But OMG this product is a PERFECT balance of hydrating and lightweight. It feels like my skin drinks it in and by the time I'm ready for bed there is hardly any residue! At first I worried maybe this meant it was too lightweight to a truly heal my barrier, but after a few weeks I can attest that it really does work.
The only downside is the packaging (they don't stand up) but tbh the formulation is so good, i'm still giving 5 stars. I also recommend the AM moisturizer, but idk how effective it is as SPF. Def get the night time though!I purchased this because of the ingredients and the reviews. The product is titled ""Barrier Renew."" One of the active ingredients is oleic acid: ""Free fatty acids (FFAs), specifically monounsaturated FFAs such as oleic acid, may disrupt skin barrier and act as permeability enhancers for other compounds present in plant oils"" [36].Dec 27, 2017. That is what I found about oleic acid. I look like I sat on the sun without protection.  Disappointed and will be returning.my skin feels absolutely amazing since using this at night. within minutes your skin feels soft, calm, supple. and the next morning I have a beautiful glow. I'm obsessed!I had been struggling with skin that felt uncomfortably dry by the end if the day. I am glad I tried this! It is a cool, thick hydrating gel with slip that dries down to something almost imperceptible on the skin. Because it didnt leave my face shiny and greasy, I didn't expect it to work to prevent dryness- but it did! I layer it over my RX at night and under my SPF in the morning with no pilling issues. I also really like that it doesnt add MORE shinyness to my skin when laying under an already dewy SPF (another brand).  My skin doesnt look glazed or juicy with this- it just looks like normal, not dehydrated, healthy skin and thats cool with me!This has  really good barrier repairing ingredients. It is not a heavy nor thick cream but a gel/cream in a generous size. The only issue ive had is the tiniest bit of pilling. So to counter that i mix this and a few drops of Stratia liquid gold or an oil which makes a pilling product foolproof."

I have just started using the RoC products. So far I have been very pleased. My skin is already looking better. I'm hoping that in time I will see a significant improvement in my skin.Cream is a very good moisturizer. Definitely worth the money.It's a bit pricey. Seems to be helping some lines on my faceMany other face creams/lotions I've tried leave my skin feeling like oily dirty; this one doesn't.Haven't used it long so I don't know how it works on wrinkles yet but it does help moisturize my dry skinIt really is just a moisturizer nothing special about it. I wouldn't buy it again but it's good if you have money to spareI've read all of these 1 star reviews and they all say the same thing...irritation, redness, chemical burn....ð apparently the one star people don't know what retinol is. It's a chemical. Chemicals irritate. That's the whole point! Start using it every other day or every 3rd day. Back off a bit if you see redness. Do not use too much or under your eyes. Get yourself an EYE CREAM for your EYE AREA. Once the irritation has subsided, then you can increase the frequency of application little by little until your skin can tolerate it daily. 
Here's the review part. It works as well as any retinal product does. It's a great value and is very hydrating if used correctly. I highly recommend it!"

So this will now be two of their skincare products I really like and does the job. And again, affordable! I use it in my morning routine and feels great! Goes on smooth and light weight. I would recommend!I just bought this came home put it on and instantly got a headache from the strong perfume smell. It's like they dumped a whole bottle of floral old lady perfume in this moisturizer. I looked at the ingredients and it actually says perfume and that shouldn't be in a face moisturizer. Returning this immediatelyI used it for the first time a month ago â¦ my skin is glowing    It looks firmer and I definitely will buy againI dont know what it is about this product but even if it is the onky thing I wear that day it atill peels and clumps on my skin after it dries. Nit a fan.The moisturizer itself works well. I like the feel of my skin while wearing it. I gave it a week but I can't wear it any more. The scent is so strong and just to much for a facial moisturizer. It smells like the sunflower perfume my Mom wore in the 90's. So to me, it just smells very dated and old. haha I gave it away.I love this day cream!!  My face is prone to hormonal breakouts, and since using this product my skin has definitely calmed down.  I don't even wear foundation anymore (unless its an event or something), I just put this on, then put on some concealer and bronzer and I'm good to go for the day!  I love this face cream and will definitely purchase again.Very strong fragrance smell and I think my skin started getting irritated by the product. Finished the container but I won't be buying it again."

Great for milia!! Mine is starting to go away.I sampled this in the store and it smelled wonderful and moisturized with being too heavy so it was perfect for my oily skin. Unfortunately, my skin reacted and I was left with a pimple and a rash on my face.I used to use clinique and it would leave my face very dry as soon as i used FRESH it left my face moisturized the same day! I love it !!While I wanted to love this Fresh product, I can barely say I like it. I have oily/combo skin but I feel like this product leaves me face really oily after application. I can't say if it was due to this, but I got acne shortly after I started using this product.I have mostly oily skin with a few dry patches and this product treats both! It's hydrating but not heavy. I also wear full face makeup everyday and  this lays on my skin like a dream! Worth the price!I've tried different products over the years and have been sticking to Estee Lauder for a long time but my skin just looked dull and tired.  I was in Ulta and a very nice salesperson recommended Fresh products. The 2 she recommended I loved and they gave me a little bag with other Fresh samples.  I loved all of them and this Fresh Rose & Hydraulic Acid Moisurizer is amazing!!  I've noticed a difference in my skin since using it and other Fresh products.  I will never stray from this line because it's truly the best!!I don't think this is build for heat but it might grip makeup which i don't wear often i love my natural skin an this didn't pass my test"
313,313,313,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial moisturizer spf 30,pimprod2002927,2536697,"A great product.This may be a decent moisturizer for winter or indoor not sweating use. Do not use for outdoor activities. It will burn your eyes SO badly. I don't have sensitive eyes or skin but I was practically blind on a summer hike. Horrible! I expect more from a brand like this.I do have to say I only just tried this product so I'm unsure if it will break me out in the future. However it feels lovely on my skin. Before I applied this product I had some slight dry patches on my skin and it noticeably reduced the dryness. It didn't leave any white cast on my skin (I do have very fair skin though) and it made my skin looks very dewy and glowing! I would definitely recommend this product :)I really do not understand the bad reviews. This is a great moisturizer with SPF in it. I personally like an all in one product and with 4.2 ounces you get a good value for your money. Not only does this have great ingredients, it is hydrating, sinks into your skin very easily, doesn't leave a white cast, and does not make your eyes burn. My skin glows after applying and it also wears SO well under makeup!! I do not find this sunscreen to be greasy at all. It actually makes me less oily throughout the day compared to the other SPF moisturizer I was using previously. I was using the Cerave AM lotion but wasn't in love with it as it took a lot of TLC to blend in and made my makeup pill. I was recommended this product by a friend and I am so glad I bought this. For those concerned about fragrance I notice a very very slight sunscreen smell but it doesn't bother me and I am someone who is sensitive to scents. This is a chemical sunscreen so some people may be sensitive to that. I am someone who isn't. I prefer chemical sunscreens anyway because they usually do not leave a white cast and are more hydrating. Mineral sunscreens are always too drying for my skin and leave too much of a whitecast.I love this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I just love how it applies and how moisturized my skin feels afterwards.It's ok. Def more of a sunscreen feel. Doesn't leave a white cast but takes a while to soak in. I have to wait quite awhile before I can begin applying my makeup. Like a lot of Kiehl's products but won't buy this one again.I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now and I swear by it. I put it on in the morning before applying my makeup and it works perfectly. I've found that some moisturizers make my foundation look kinda wonky, but my makeup goes on top of this one nicely. Also, I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this product. I'm never going back!"
314,314,314,cetaphil,hydrating moisturizing cream body moisturizer,pimprod2028655,2586929,"Im currently using this moisturizer along with a 10% Benzoyl peroxide cleanser and its the best. My skin type is dry but acne prone fyi. This moisturizer can be used for the face and body and my skin does not feel dry or tight, Simply moisturized.I use to moisturize my face in the morning and night. I definitely recommend!So im new to skincare. I was having a bad breakout. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin. Ever ""sensitive skin moisturizer"" straight up burns my face. This moisturizer has never hurt my face. I use this as my night time moisturizer. In only a week i have seen great changes to my face. It feels super smooth. And dont quote me on this, but i BELIEVE this product has niacinamide in it. The niacinamide cleared my redness. I highly reccomend if you are stumped on a moisturizer for sensitive skin.My skin is dry and that makes it quite sensitive. But this lotion and shower gel does not irritate my skin and certainly helps it feel better.I love this i have dry skin especially in the fall and winter definitely recommendThis is one of the only lotions that does not break out my mega sensitive acne prone skin, but the niacinimide in this stings, itches, and burns for about an hour after i apply.  I wish cetaphil made a lotion without niacinimide and hyaluronic acid, as they both sting and itch on people who have mega sensitive skin.   Until they make one, this will have to do.This is a good skin moisturizer for all skin types."

It is already half way gone with only using it a half full of times because the lid does not lock and stay in place! Highly disappointed.I need C10 now!Vitamin C does wonders for your skin. I use this for daytime care in conjunction with the Redermic R in the evening. It's a great combo !I use Redermic C every morning as my moisturizer.  I put it on, let it stay on a few minutes to absorb, and then apply my foundation and other makeup.I use for 1 year and my skin now looks better, my Dermatologist recommended it ðð¼I used to use Dr Perricone products which are great but pricey so I read about the LaRoche line and some have gotten rewards from New Beauty Magazine. I gave it a try and I am very happy with the results ! I use Redermic R every other night and the Redermic C everyday in the morning. My skin looks and feels the same as when I used Perricone products. It consistently delivers.Try it."

The idea that it helps to brighten the skin without Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) won me over. I find Vitamin C can be too aggressive on my skin.I love this moisturizer! Its my favorite to use day in and day out. It has an extremely soft, lightweight texture so its great for daily, but also has so many brightening, moisturizing, and mild resurfacing properties, its also great for my evening regimen as well. Ive noticed a lot of my dark spots evening out, and my skins surface looking more ""glass"" like. The Vitamin C & Beautyberry in this work together so well to be brightening & moisturizing. This is definitely one of my HOLY GRAILS!!I seen a significant difference in my dark spots with this product!This cream is amazing! It even tone my skin and took care of the dark spots. I've been it regularly, and I love the feeling of smooth and find lines!Love how my skin looks more evenI do not have sensitive skin and this product made me break out. I'm 56 and never had acne issues. I do not recommend thisPurchased this at Ulta because of points promotion at the store"

319,319,319,panoxyl,am oil control moisturizer with broad spectrum spf 30 mineral sunscreen,pimprod2041857,2615401,"I do love this product and highly recommend it to those with acne prone skin, as it's great for oil control and doesn't clog pores. however, the first few times you use it, it may burn slightly, but your skin should get used to it after a few uses. it also leaves a slight white cast but if you blend it in enough you should be fine. PRO TIP: do NOT use the panoxyl PM moisturizer if you have acne prone skin. it has pore clogging ingredients!I wear it under my makeup and ever since using it I can clearly see a huge difference. It stops my oiliness from seeping through my foundation and has even made my makeup look much better. I will definitely be buying this product again!I love that it actually makes my skin less oily and it also makes my skin appear more smoothe. 10/10Its an okay sunscreen it does leave a white cast only good thing about product is that it controles my oily skin.I was hoping for a lightweight moisturizer/sunscreen combo, this isn't it. It's more like an extremely thick suncreen than a moisturizer.  It dries insanely fast, and leaves a terrible white cast! I'm already super pale, and this made me look like a ghost. It doesn't sit nice on the skin at all. It dries streaky and applies unevenly- it literally looks like chalk. I found that it tends to pill around the edges of my face, like my jaw and hairline. I have dry skin, and this dried me out even worse. The product contained a strong fragrenced smell, in my opinion. I washed it off, becuase of all theee factors. I wont personally re-buy, or recommend.DO NOT BUY ITNext time this PanOxyl moisturizer goes on sale I am buying two.   This is one of the best products I've ever used.  Absorbs quickly but isn't sticky or tacky.  Doesn't irritate my skin.  I have combination skin and large poes and my T zone still gets shiny and oily.  This makes my skin feel so silky and it absorbs oil for hours.   It motivates me to use SPF more often because it isn't an extra step in the morning anymore and I also don't have to fight with it.  It is so much more affordable than many other choices to so that's a bonus.  I hope they never stop making this!  
I haven't tried it under primer or foundation."
