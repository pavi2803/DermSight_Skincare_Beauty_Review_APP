0,clinique,moisture surge 100h auto-replenishing hydrator moisturizer,pimprod2021615,2576544," * I love Clinique and have been using them for 20 years, so when my old moisturizer was discontinued, I switched to this one without a second thought. I haven't changed any of my makeup or skincare products at all in the last 2-3 years, so I know it had to be this product. It's nowhere near as moisturizing as the old product, and has a strange jelly texture that doesn't feel nearly as moisturizing as a cream does, and has a cooling sensation similar to products with alcohol. This item might be fine for someone with normal or possibly oily skin but if you are very dry, I wouldn't recommend it. My rosacea flared up after years of calm, my cheeks are tender, my entire face peeled in tiny flakes the next day. and the lines under my eyes are much more crepey. I gave this two stars because I switched to using it on my neck and hands at night and that hasn't caused any issues, and it might just be an ingredient my skin doesn't agree with. For my face I switched to Paula's Choice skin recovery hydrating mask and it's been working better for very dry skin. I still recommend Clinique for their makeup and eye cream, though as that's never caused me any problems! * I've been using this product for years. Since I am naturally oily, I use this product at night as my final step in my skincare routine. I use it to lock in all my nighttime routine products. 10/10 would recommend. * Just starting my second jar, and I love it. It makes my skin feel moisturized but not greasy. It's light but it keeps my skin soft and smooth even with cold winter weather and dry conditions inside. * I finally found a great moisturizer that doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy, absorbs quickly, doesn't cause breakouts, and literally leaves my skin baby smooth. Moisture surge has blown me away. I've tried a good bit of clinique moisturizers and really disliked them all until trying this one. I'm a 32 year old mother of 4 and for the first time in years, I was complimented on the appearance of my skin. This will be my go to from now on! I've been recommending it any chance I get. * So smooth! It is like a drink for your face! * The lid to my container came crooked and can't be screwed on properly. Looks like it was warped during manufacturing. You get a very small amount of product for what you pay for. * I use this on my face,but,more importantly,my hands. They were cracking open with wintertime dryness. They look perfect. I love it on my face. I put it on my arms,and legs. It is silk in a jar. I love the real glass jar also. A product that works."
1,bubble,over night hydrating sleep mask,pimprod2035928,2600876," * No problems here! This feels fantastic. Deeply moisturizes without being too heavy or thick. * This product is amazing. I like this because moisturizer is mostly for the day. All you have to do is have your face damp and get a pump of it and gently rub it on. I love the feeling of my face in the morning. * This product is amazing. I like this because moisturizer is mostly for the day. All you have to do is have your face damp and get a pump of it and gently rub it on. I love the feeling of my face in the morning. * I bought this product to help with my dry skin. It worked well, and made my skin smooth and hydrated. I have very sensitive skin and this didn't break me out. 10/10 recommend! Good job Bubble 🫧! ✨ * I love this product  It left my skin moisturized And shiny * I got this for my daughter as a moisturizer for the winter. She really likes the Inside Out branded moisturizer from this line and I thought this would be a good addition. She has no allergies and never reacts to products. She used this and almost immediately said it started to burn! We washed off quickly but it caused her face to become extremely flushed and hot. 
Read the ingredients and found it contains cinnamon bark extract!!! Why in the world would there be cinnamon in a MOISTURIZER Marketed towards youths?!? I would have never even thought to read the ingredients on a hydrating product for ingredients that burn. Needless to say we will be returning! * having sensitive acne prone skin makes it hard trying new products, but i'm so glad i listened to the reviews! this mask leaves your skin so smooth and hydrated and it didn't break me out! highly recommend coming from a licensed esthetician :)"

3,philosophy,hope in a jar smooth-glow multi-tasking moisturizer spf 30,pimprod2037931,2605578," * I am so happy with this moisturizer.  It is thick and creamy and feels great on my skin! * I am very pleased with the coverage of this product.  I will be purchasing more as time goes on. * The pump on my bottle is damaged, it continues to leak, so had to take pump out. I emailed philosophy and they claim it is impossible to replace. So not very happy that I have a 22 oz bottle of face cleanser that will last me for months, but no pump to dispense it. * I've been using the Philosophy skin care line for a very long time. They have changed the formula for the cleanser and the microdelivery and I'm not loving the new formulas. I just bought the 22oz with a pump to put by my sink. It makes a total mess. Every time I use it there is a blob of leakage on the sink so much wasted product. Guess thats what happens when they water the formula down. * It's my favorite cleanser! It leaves my skin super  clean without drying it!
The best cleanser! * One of the best make up removers, melts the make up off your skin * I was reading the comments trying to gauge this oroducts effectiveness for the price point and kept seeing references towards this product being a makeup cleaner/ face cleaner? This profuct is a moisturizer and only that. Do not spend this kind of money ro use this product wrong"
4,drunk elephant,protini polypeptide firming moisturizer,pimprod2028061,2588434," * Save your money - this moisturizer is expensive and does nothing. My face actually got drier and my skin was flaky being on this. Disappointed because the price is ridiculous for the worst moisturizer I've ever used * I will definitely not be purchasing this moisturizer again after a beauty specialist at Ulta in Houston Tx at the Memorial City mall highly recommended it. It's a disappointment for the price left my face more dehydrated then ever been using it for over a month. * Love it! * This is my fav drunk elephant moisturizer. It feels really nice when you put it on but also pretty lightweight. 5 stars!! * I was struggling to find a good moisturizer that would not brake me out and actually make my face feel moisturized. Once i tried this, i loved it so much! My face felt sooooooo nice and moisturized! Tottaly recommend' * Jen loves review is a YouTuber who recommend the skincare product and I'm glad I bought it and I'm glad I tried it and I love it. It's amazing. I have normal dry skin and I live in Texas are it's crazy weather and it holds up to our weather * I love this cream - absorbs well and keeps you skin hydrated . Lovely texture and scent - but the price  is crazy - sample

5,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial cream with squalane,pimprod2002804,2540233," * got this as a sample for my birthday back in july. trust i will br buying again. makeup looks sooooo good with this moisturizer * I've tried a ton of products, and this is by far one of my favorites! Ultra Facial Cream is so lightweight but hydrates my skin like no other face cream I've tried. It's a little bit pricey, but I definitely think it's worth it! * Less packaging which means more product for my money. Love this facial cream!!! I don't feel like my face is dried out when I use this and my eyes do not burn from wearing it like other creams I have used! * Very light i feel very moisturized * Very light i feel very moisturized * It hydrates very well and is non-tacky when dry. I'm still debating on whether it's making me break out (still haven't figure out what works best for me yet). For comparison, verse dew point gel also dries well, but I don't find it anywhere near as hydrating. * My flare ups have been driving me crazy over the past few months, especially on my neck, but this moisturizer made a huge difference! My skin feels nourished, buttery, and NOT ITCHY. My breakouts have decreased and im starting to glow again!"

7,tula,24-7 weightless moisture day & night gel cream,pimprod2045112,2624255," * Absolutely love this! I never put lotion on my face and just started using this product and I get so many compliments now how nice I look and young. I am almost 45 but I don't look it. * My beauty consultant, Beautifull (yes! that is her name) is the best in the business! I had so many questions when I was looking for a skin routine. I must say my skin is WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. She is located in North Texas! * I stopped buying moisture surge (and clinique in general) earlier this year, and searched for a comparable moisturizer all of 2024. Out of the 15 products I tried this year, this has been the best option by far. I honestly think this gel moisturizer is even better than Clinique's because it's fragrance free and 100% cruelty free. So many moisturizers are also too heavy for my sensitive and acne prone skin, but this is so lightweight and absorbs quickly. It's definitely worth the price, and a little goes a long way. * This is so light and so hydrating, it does not leave any sticky residue on the skin and no harsh smell. It cools the face and gives it a nice glow * I'm in my mid 40s, with sensitive combination skin, and this gel cream has been absolutely fantastic!  My previous moisturizer was a bit too heavy, and this one is just right for day and night use!!! * This product is going back! It was recommended to me because they were out of stock of my go-to product (a different brand). Upon applying a thin layer of Tula 24-7 Weightless Moisture Day & Night Gel Cream to my face and neck, something instantly felt off. The texture was fine so I couldn't place what it was. A minute or so later it started - the slight face burning. Minutes passed and it got to the point I couldn't ignore it and had to wash my face yet again just to get it off! * I received this as a free sample and now I'm hooked. It works so great for my skin. It leaves it refreshed without being heavy. Other moisturizers can be too thick but this is thin and blends perfectly. Worth the purchase!"
8,it cosmetics,confidence in a cream anti-aging hydrating moisturizer,pimprod2033684,2598796," * Love love love !!  Theres nothing not to like about this product me my mom and sister use this and from the first time our skin fell in love with it * I think when a brand changes the formula of an established, popular product, consumers should be informed. I have repurchased this moisturizer multiple times, even when they changed it not long ago. When they changed the formula and marketed it as ""recharged,"" we all knew to expect a difference. Now, the formula has changed again without any information. The consistency, scent, and feel on my face are different. Who knows if the efficacy has changed as well? I like to know what I am buying and, more importantly, what I am putting on my skin! I think it should be mandatory to disclose changes in formulation of skincare * I have very dry skin, this helps keep it soft and moisturized. I have been using for a few years, not going to change to any other brand. * Absolutely love this! It was great for my dry aging skin. Also, helps with repairing the barrier * I haven't used the product in a while and understand the ingredients have been change.  It's okay, but I would prefer the original product. * Love the way it feels. Have used for several years. Have tried other products and always come back . Skin soft.get compliments all the time about my skin and no wrinkles around the eyes, youthful appearance. Also use serum and nighttime moisturizer. * is wonderful"

10,the ordinary,natural moisturizing factors + ha daily moisturizer,pimprod2007113,2551163," * This moisturizer is definitely a good buy. It's goes on smooth and you don't have to use a lot.  Keeps my skin soft and smooth. * This moisturizer is both cheap and amazing, is moisturizing but not heavy, and feels similar to more expensive moisturizer such as the drunk elephant peptide cream. 1000% would recommend * This moisturizer is such a classic to me. It's what I started my skin care journey with and I still use it to this day. I have normal to dry skin, and it feels so nice. This moisturizer is not too heavy! I have had problems with heavy moisturizers leaving a ton of small pimple everywhere but this one doesnt do that. It is very affordable and worth the price. * It's my first time buying The Ordinary product and I love it this moisturizer leaves my face very smooth. I've had this really dry spot around my mouth and after a couple days of using The Ordinary moisturizer, it's not completely gone but it had definitely helped * I will definitely buy again in a bigger size. It's very lightweight, melts into your skin, and leaves it soft and not greasy. * I absolutely love all of The Ordinarys products but this one was just not the one for me. Its very thick but still doesnt glide on the skin nicely, it dries too fast and ends up pilling on your face as youre rubbing it in. Applying makeup over it is a nightmare, even after letting it ""dry"" and settle into my skin for about 10 minutes my makeup was just flaking off so bad. Doesnt leave my skin feeling moisturized at all. Wish I liked it but unfortunately I will be returning this product. * I loved this during summer, it's super lightweight! However I do need something more in winter. That is nothing against the product though, it's just my preferance."
11,bobbi brown,vitamin enriched face base moisturizer & primer with vitamin c + hyaluronic acid,pimprod2025028,2583728," * This doesn't help my dry skin at all. * It is a luxury product that truly has the luxury feel and performance. I know it's so pricey but it really does make a difference in makeup application. It smooths, softenss, and preps skin better than any other primer I've used. It's so thick and rich and little goes a long way too! 

Bonus, it's SO universal!! I've used it on all skin types. 

Annnnd  I see some people complaining about the smell. Idk what's going on with ya'll but everyone I've ever used this one comments on how GOOD it smells!! * I like the way my skin feels after using it BUT the strong citronella smell I'm not 100% gonna be able to get past. * I've been wanting to give this product A try for a long time finally purchased travel size. Let's just say I'll be getting the full size! * I can't tell if this is a great moisturizing primer or not.  I am not sensitive to fragrance, but this gave me a headache almost immediately. I tried it again the next day and the same thing happened.  The smell is overwhelming.  Why?  I gave it to my daughter in law.  She was thrilled. * Love how smooth my face is after i apply it before my foundation. * I expected it to be better than this. There are other types that are much better than it, especially since its price is expensive. There are better types with its high price. I do not recommend it, frankly???"

13,la roche-posay,cicaplast balm b5 soothing therapeutic multi purpose cream,pimprod2018263,2570171," * I have very sensitive and extremely dry skin. I had started a new, stronger, retinol and overdid myself. My skin was red, hot and burning. This was the only product that not only didn't worsen the burn, but soothed it!! Within 24hours my skin was already feeling better. 

I noticed some reviews note excessive pilling, I have not experienced that. I use it in combination with retinol, vitamin c, and sunscreen. The only thing it slightly pills with is my vitamin c, but nothing a 5min wait can't fix. 

This product appears very greasy after application, however it does go away after some time. I just use this at night! * I got sun spots on my face, like little white patches. and I started using this and they started going away. Also I have super dry skin and this helps soo much. it's so worth it. only con is it doesn't have alot in a bottle. * It has a different texture than I expected but the dimethicone in this hand cream makes it more of a protective balm. My hands normally gets wrecked during the cold months but this has helped keep my skin from peeling and cracking. A must have for me now! * The Holy grail for my akincare! Please never chnage it. * this sadly broke me out when I applied it all over my face. I would get little pimples in places I tended not to get acne regularly, like my cheeks. Then, I saw a beauty creator recommend only to apply this to your nose to help with blackheads, and it works wonders! I have completely stopped using pore strips. Whenever I get bad blackheads or pimples on my nose, I apply this ONLY to my nose at night as the last step of my skincare routine and wake up the next morning with clearer skin! * I bought this while having issues of eczema on my eye lids. No other products worked. Highly recommend! * It's very nice for oily and dry skin"

I've gotten rid of so many  wrinkles in my face by using this product religiously. * Not oily * I think there is something better for me. * I felt the difference in a few days w my skin.  I do notice a bit on the greasy side but its still worth the results on your skin.  I have used a non oily primer like the  MILK product primer and it helps * Gifted by Dermalogica. I really like this moisturizer. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. It is not greasy or sticky on my skin. It leaves no white cast and my makeup looks great over it. It contains SPF 50 and has some great ingredients that great for the skin. It highly recommend it. * I loved this moisturiser + sunscreen as it made my makeup go on smoother and caused less creasing but this is NOT for acne prone skin. Broke me out in tiny white acne all over my forehead. Wish it was non comedogenic. I liked everything else about it. * This moisturizer really did go on easily, particularly for having an SPF that truly did protect my face from burning in the summer.It smells nice, too-just a hint of that recognizable  Dermologica smell to make you feel energized. I just don't think I can add it to my repertoire due to the price point. I use and reapply sunscreen to my face daily, especially this time of year and wouldn't be able to purchase this on a regular basis given the high cost. If you are looking for something that feels good on your skin, is easy to apply and is an effective SPF-try it if you can afford routine purchases of it!"

I thought it was just my skin being sensitive, so i asked my boyfriend to use it. He's always had clear skin (only uses water to clean his face, and did the same this time). he also woke up with acne and little bumps the next day! He never gets acne, ever. 

However… ive been using it on my neck and it did soften my skin there + it looks great. So i wouldn't use on my face but it's a good neck product lol.

I have even had some friends ask what I have been doing differently in my skincare routine because they noticed a difference. * i've been using this moisturizer for quite a while, and I've had it for months without it running out. It's very lightweight and leaves you glowing, making it look like glass skin and has gotten rid of pimples. * COSRX snail serum was out of stock when I needed more so I tried this instead. It's basically a heavier version of that, somewhere between a serum and a moisturizer. If you're oily like me this could totally replace moisturizer when it's hot & humid!"

When I stoped using it the bumps were gone in a few days. My skin didn't like it but i can see this working for other peoples skin. * Very moisturizing for the face. A little goes a long way.

Highly recommend this product."

I had this issue as well with the non oily skin version but thoughf it was a bad batch. I guess the brand isnt as good as it used to be. * I love this product line. Love tge way it leaves my skin. * I am unsure how so many have the pilling effect. I use a drop of this after my serums, slightly smaller than a dime to moisturize my entire face and neck - patting it in. I am left with hydrated skin, smooth makeup and no oil (even after a full day). * This product is the TRUTH! I am absolutely in love. I was previously using a tula moisturizer, hiwever it didnt mesh well withcmy skin, ultimately making me greasy after so long during the day. The ""matte"" aspect if this cream is not too much fo cancel out the moisture, but leaves you feeling clean and smooth. I highly recommend!!! * Love that it's not oily * I noticed that using it didn't really aid or trigger my acne (i use the oil cleanser from same brand) and I also just don't like it because one- its so small, 2- it leaves like a film on ur face when you're done that really bugs me. * it feels smooth when you put initially dot it on your face but it flakes like CRAZY when you rub it in. i tried cleaning my face with other products. nope, it was this moisturizer. also when you wear it all day, it ends up making my face feel like it has even more oil on it with time. i dont really feel like it mousturizes as it should so i'm definitely not repurchasing. i really wanted to like this :/"

It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy! * I can't believe it took me so long to find this amazing product. I will have it a part of my skin routine forever now! Such a great lotion for my whole body. Highly recommend purchasing if you have dry and sensitive skin. Game changing product so excited I found it! * As someone with dry and flaky skin, I've tried countless lotions over the years, but none have worked as effectively as this one.

The lotion has a rich, creamy texture that absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. My skin feels immediately hydrated and smooth after applying it."
32,dermalogica,skin smoothing cream moisturizer,pimprod2000019,2536765," * This moisturizer works good for me. I am extremely oily and it's more like a lotion and it leaves my skin soft and supple and it brightens my skin which is dull. * I've only been using this product for about a week and bought thr travel size to try it out, but I can tell already my skin has never felt and looked better! For about over a year I have been struggling with my face (ezcema, acene, other dry spots, discoloration) and Cerave products were my holy grail, until it wasn't, since then I have tried numerous products, spent $$$$ and nothing work. For the last 3-4months I have been using La Roche Posay face wash & face moisturizer and its been blah. I have only been using it bc i refused to try something else and spend more money. Finally, my sister suggested Dermalogica and OMG!! All this time I had been suffering. I bought the travel size to test it out bc the full size are pricey, but let me tell you, I don't care they are expensive anymore. I have already purchased the full size products and have a full regimen for my facs. Like I said, 

I've only been using the face mositurizer, face wash, the blue bottle exfoliter (twice a week), and the brightening kit (only at night) (all travel size) and my face looks & feels amazing. 

These are expensive products, but theres a spanish saying ""lo bueno cuesta"", in english ""the good things cost"" and with these products, I can agree. Also, a little bit really goes a long way. For the face wash, I only use a pea size and its really more than enough and prettu much same off all other products. * It moisturized my face so good. Unfortunately, i cant stand the bad smell…its so bad! * I am 48 and have been bouncing around forever trying to find the perfect cream for my combination skin.  A little goes a long way.  No greasy residue and moisturizes my dry spots all day long.  My skin is smooth and fine lines are completely blurred after a few weeks of use. Best cream out there for my skin. * I enjoy the smell it reminds me of baby lotion. My skin has never looked so hydrated until this product. I don't think I will ever try after moisturizer. * . * Smooth on no residue. Leaves your face feeling moisturized without an oily finish. Great size for travel."
33,charlotte tilbury,magic cream moisturizer with hyaluronic acid,pimprod2043375,2619315," * I finally tried Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream Moisturizer, and I get the hype now! It feels so rich and instantly makes my skin look plump and glowing. Plus, the hyaluronic acid keeps me hydrated all day – I'm obsessed! * My second time purchasing this 
Love the hydration it gives me * I love the Magic Cream product. It applies on smoothly, smells better than most creams on the market, and makes my skin glow! I have been buying this for two years now, and was so happy when Ulta started also selling this last year. * I received the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream and Magic Serum in exchange for my honest review. The Magic Cream is thick and creamy, so it's best to leave sit for a few minutes. It is super helpful for dry skin and works wonders! I highly recommend this product, especially as we approach the colder months. I highly recommend this product- while the price may be high, it is worth it! * Leaving a review because I have the perfect anecdote that is worth reading. I've been using this for two years now and nothing compares. I go on and off of it when I try new expensive creams/moisturizers. I have dullness as an og skin issue where my skin doesn't look as silky clean and plump as I want it to when i apply a cream and this is the only thing that consistently gives me that and brings my skin back to life after time away from it and using something else. I have been yearning for a new night cream lately just out of sheer boredom as I do from time to time and I randomly remembered that about 6 years ago my boujee friend had given me a sample of a cream that I tried once and woke up with baby soft radiant skin. I was just amazed at the drastic overnight difference in that sample.I was broke at that time and assumed it was expensive so I didn't bother to take note of what and where to buy it. Fast forward to now, texted her to hope she could remember that far back and she did! But turns out it was the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream... So in learning the cream I keep going back to is the one that wowed me years ago too is what prompted this review because I realize it is one of the rare products that has truly earned it's place as a staple and has been the only cream to consistently wow me over the span of 5+ years of trying different ones. * Very hydrating moisturizer. This goes on very thick, and I think it would be really nice for mature skin. I didn't notice a huge difference using this product, but overall I would say this is a great investment in skin care. * Let me start by saying this: If I could bathe in Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream, I would. And no, I'm not exaggerating. This cream is like what I imagine unicorn tears and liquid gold combined would feel like on my skin—pure, unadulterated luxury.

I first applied it one evening, thinking, ""Okay, let's see what the hype is all about."" The moment I rubbed it in, I heard a chorus of angels sing, and I'm pretty sure my reflection in the mirror whispered, ""Girl, where have you been all my life?"" Within minutes, my skin went from ""stressed-out and dehydrated"" to ""I've had 8 hours of sleep and an IV drip of green juice.""

Now, let's talk about the texture. It's thick—but not in the way your great aunt's fruitcake is thick. No, this is the decadent, velvety kind of thick that melts into your skin and leaves you looking like you've been airbrushed by the gods. The hydration? Next level. I'm talking ""surviving-the-Sahara-desert"" kind of hydration. It's like my skin just drank a tall glass of water after running a marathon, and it's still basking in the afterglow.

And the scent? A subtle floral elegance that makes you feel like you've been transported to a secret garden, where Charlotte herself is hand-picking petals for your personal batch of cream. Not too strong, just enough to make you feel like you're one luxurious human being.

But here's the kicker: This magic isn't temporary. After a couple of weeks of daily use, my skin genuinely feels softer, plumper, and smoother. I'm convinced my fine lines packed up and left town. I've had strangers ask me what my secret is, and let me tell you, it's a struggle not to whip out the jar and give them an impromptu skincare sermon.

The only downside? My skin now has expensive taste, and I may need to take out a small loan to keep my addiction going. But hey, beauty has its price, and Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream is worth every penny.

In summary: It's not just a cream, it's a life-altering skincare experience. Get it, and thank me (and Charlotte) later."

I was so impressed when a few pumps for a few days did all of that, and cleared my texture. The ingredients are clean and there isnt a scent. I am so excited to try more from this brand because this was a great product! * I purchased this for my teenage daughter during a sale bc she likes this moisturizer. What I would recommend is purchasing from the the store. We purchased online since it was out of stock at our store and the seal was broken. Makes me wonder if it was a return. * If you have oily/combo skin, this is the perfext moisturizer for u.

Kept hearing that it saves skin barrier and it does! The reviews say it's watery, but you have to basically massage the product around before opening it. I've NEVER had an issue with it. This product saved my skin from the harsh cold temperature and I mix it with my foundation during the winter. Never having dry skin again. Definitely recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin!!! * This is my first time ever purchasing and i love it. I have very oily, sensitive, acne prone skin. Its winter time here and my skin has been dry after I wash it. So far, I double cleanse with bioderma micellar water,  panoxyl 10% morning & night depending on dry my skin is, and the aveene cream.

Heals dry skin, or blemishes. * Just opened this to try for the first time, and a gush of blue liquid came out. I put the top back on and shook thinking maybe it separated, but this is just a weird blue liquid.

While it has a nice texture and the ingredients look fabulous, this cream resulted in the worst allergic reaction I've ever experienced. After two uses, my skin was visibly red, tingly, textured, and incredibly itchy. Unfortunately think this damaged my barrier as my skin is still recovering using other tried and tested products. If you have sensitive skin, I'd skip. * Oh how I wanted to love this. The ingredient list looks nice, and I'd heard good reviews, but unfortunately this cream just did not work out for me. I have no idea what's causing it, but this moisturizer somewhat burns my skin every time I apply it. It also seems to be making my facial eczema worse. The texture is different, more of a whipped consistency, but still hydrating. I feel like my skin might need more moisture though. It's also expensive for what it is. Unfortunately it's too late for me to return it, and since it was pricey I'm going to use it up anyways, but I would not repurchase. Honestly you can find many just as good-if not better face creams out there with similar ingredients, that cost much less. * Made skin dry and itchy, not moisturizing. * I use this over the mad hippie super A serum, at night before I go to work. And I love this product. I don't use it twice a day but you probably could if you wanted to. This also feels like a rich moisturizer after I use the mad hippie enzyme scrub, it just makes my skin feel wonderful. I have acne prone skin and also wanted something good for anti aging, since 30 was approaching. * I wanted to love this product. I wanted a night cream with collagen & this has mostly good reviews. But the morning after the 1st time using it, I had 2 huge red zits (which is unlike my normal skin). Every time I use it, I break out the next morning. * Love how soft this cream makes my face feel!

I only need to blot once a day at work instead of three! * I have used FAB products before. Always liked their daily moisturizer but i have oily skin so it didn't help, but this oil control moisturizer helps a lot. My skin doesn't look as shiny. Perfect product for summer. It is not heavy at all. * In my search for an oil-free moisturizer this was recommended. I used this for a month and loved it. No breakouts, controlled my oily skin and seemed to work really well. So, I stocked up and got more. I noticed something was different after the 3rd use of the new jar. I started breaking out. I haven't broken out in almost 3 years. I was confused and continued to use it because why would it start breaking me out now? I loved the first jar. I'm not sure if the formula changed or if my skin is just being finicky. 

Overall, I recommend the product because it seems to be very good. It's a struggle for us oily girls to find products that offer us a balance of hydration while keeping oil at bay. I hope it works for you if you try it :) * Ever since Neutrogena discontinued their Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin - my holy grail of moisturizers - I have been desperately searching for a replacement that will keep my breakouts under control without over-drying my skin. The search is finally over - this is it!! My skin starting clearing up and looking healthier after the first overnight application! I've now been using it for 2 months and it's continued to significantly reduce my breakouts (in frequency and duration) without drying out my skin. The only downside is that the container is about half the size I was assuming it would be, based on other FAB products I've purchased. (Although that's on me for not looking at the size printed on the front of the product.) Each container lasts me a little over 2 months with one application per day on my face and sometimes neck and/or chest. Honestly though I'm in love. * Ive used this product for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin and have used several different face moisturizers over the years and this is the only one that keeps my face from getting super shiny by the end of the day, even with serums underneath it. It WORKS so to me its worth every penny! * This is the best moisturizer I have ever found for my oily skin! I have an oily t-zone and this keeps my skin from becoming oily all day. I worked an 8-hour shift wearing this and when I got home my forehead was still dry, but not peeling, it just felt finally normal. I use this on my entire face, but keep in mind you can use it only in certain areas that you struggle with oil, so don't let other reviews about dry skin deter you. With winter coming up I may begin to only use this on my oily areas and another moisturizer on others, but this is literally the holy grail moisturizer for anyone struggling with oily skin. * I have combination skin and this has saved my skin texture and made it so soft. The consistency feels so nice and it's not overly drying even in my dry areas. Feel like it's reduced some redness as well."

I've only reacted to one other product in my life.... * I was so disappointed in this moisturizer. When I pressed the pump down, mostlt water came out. I e-mailed the company, and they responded that it needed to be mixed up or shaken. I had already tried that. They acted like it was my fault. Don't waste your money. * Not sure what happened but this time my product has a lot of water in it than the cream itself.  Not really happy with product this time. * Really love how this product makes most of my face feel. Around my nose and mouth, my skin feels very tight and dry, but it does not. I've been using it for about a week and a half, so I am hoping it is just my skin getting used to it. The package is great, but the way it comes out is a little annoying as I feel like I don't know how much to press. Overall, a great product! * it moisturizes nicely, but not quite enough for my super dry skin. i put consistency as both a con and a pro. sometimes its nice and light, yet moisturizing. other times it feels thicker/doesnt blend in as easily. my main complaint is that (maybe its my batch?) theres so much water in the bottle. when i pump it, sometimes straight water comes out. i even tried to shake the bottle up thinking itd help and it didnt really. beads of water just come up with the lotion. when its so expensive, i wish it was mixed properly or contained less water. if not that, i wish there were a way i could mix it up but with the packaging, although cute and creative, i cannot. * I've been using this for a while & always softens ny face. I love the idea of adding bloom drops. I use it in winter a lot because my skin gets dry and theres no spf in this. I've had 6-7 bottles of this & at the end I wonder if i got all the product. I finally got bored and determined ans managed to get my last bottle open and was stunned at how much product was left both under the lid and in the bottle. Now I think of how much product I've trashed in the past 6-7 bottles. I'm thinking they owe me 1/2 bottle. * I have mostly oily, but combination skin. 
I use tretanoin.
When i first started using this i had a damaged skin barier from over exfoliating.
Over exfoliating made my perioral dermatitis flare up and this didnt burn it or make it red!! It was amazing. Its light weight. I dont even use a full pump. I thought id hate the pump but its actually great, if you have long nails pump moisturizers are goated i bet. But my only nag was that i had my last bottle a bit long and somehow the oils and cream separated. So id pump it and thered be moisturizer but the oil would be spilling off my fingers. Id still purchase this again anyway but definitely pay attention to your best by date, im sure if it wasnt a pump it could be remixxxed but idk. Maybe ill pump the rest into a tiny container"

48,beautycounter,countercontrol matte effect gel cream,pimprod2038172,2606559," * If you truly have oily skin, you know the difference in a review from someone with oily skin vs someone whos skin gets oily.  I have oily skin and probably spend upwards of $1K a year on products trying to find things that actually do as they claim, and this is one of them.

I was a little reluctant to purchase this as the price is pretty high for a brand I've never used, but I'm glad that I took the risk on it.  Prior to this moisturizer I was either using none at all (because most others just make me more oily, dont need redundant products on oily skin), or I was using the La-Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Matte one which didn't do much for me. Obviously how this will work for you is going to be different for everyone, and the other products you use prior to your moisturizer will make a difference as well.

For reference I am a 28 yr old female, white/Caucasian.  My morning routine is: wash with a clay based cleanser (Dermalogica), tone (Fenty Skin), hyperpigmentation serum (Good Molecules), niacinamide/zinc serum (Sunday Riley), then this moisturizer. The consistency of this product is great for oil as it is a gel based product, but it comes out more opaque white than clear which is fine. It does not have much of a fragrance that I have noticed, but I'm not sensitive to fragrance so I wouldn't be one to say. When I put this on it almost feels as if it is a crossover between a moisturizer and a makeup primer that blurs your pores.  Now it does not make your pores go away by any means, but it does HELP.  Immediately after applying my skin is definitely mattified but again, not completely shine free as if it is a primer with the sole purpose of making your skin look like it has powder on it. It does not make my skin feel tight and dried out, it genuinely makes me feel moisturized and smooth without the glowy look that normal moisturizers do. From my experience it definitely does not keep me matte for 8 hours, I would say after about 3-4 hours I start to see shine on my face to the point where I feel the need to blot if I were going out somewhere (this is all without wearing makeup or anything on top of my morning skin routine, I work from home).

If you truly have an oily/combo skin type this is not going to be your holy-grail product that makes all of your problems disappear (will continue to search for it), but if it is within your budget for a product of this type then this is 100% top 5 best moisturizers for oily skin on the market right now in my opinion after having used this for a few weeks now.  Would repurchase (and I rarely ever find products I do)!  

I also just want to throw out there that I did buy this on my own, was not asked/paid to write this, and I think this is either my only review I've ever written on Ulta or one of a few over a span of years that I don't even remember. * The packaging is very luxe but the pump feels like its empty and its still half full. It doesn't mattify anything but it is a nice mix of a gel and lotion and a lightweight moisturizer. This is an MLM and I do feel it's overpriced for what it is. It's pretty basic. * Matte effect that works great as a moisturizer/ primer for oily skin types"
49,good molecules,lightweight daily moisturizer,pimprod2023937,2582316," * This is a good, scent free moisturizer. It sinks in quickly and leaves my skin hydrated. * My skin loves this moisturizer and drinks it up! A small dallop goes a long way, allowing for the bottle to last awhile. It is very lightweight, I have been using it for 3 weeks and my skin is soft and hydrated. I love how affordable it is, considering there is a plethora of steep moisturizers in this store! 

I would not recommend using this product if you have sensitive skin. My good friend tried it out and was dissapointed to discover it gave her face a burning sensation (as did Good Molecules Hyaluronic Acid Serum). * I have extremely dry skin, and this moisturizes it so well. Bonus points, it doesn't peel with make up. * Didn't cause any breakouts or anything but did not moisturizer even a single bit. My face was rlly dry and dull when wearing this. Wouldn't rlly recommend tbh:( * This is the perfect lightweight moisturizer that feels creamy but doesnt make me an oily mess by the end of the day. I like trying new products so I very rarely repurchase items, but dare I say this is my holy grail daily moisturizer! * I use this moustrizer along with their hylauronic acid serum, and it works great! * I really like this moisturizer. I love that it comes in a tube, is super lightweight, smells great and leaves my face feeling hydrated all day with no greasy residue. Also love that it's less expensive than my regular choice, which is a little heavier than this. I might be a convert!"

Targets older ladies who don't want to spend time looking around for a cheaper better product. NEXT! * My skin literally won't accept anything other than this moisturizer! I have extremely sensitive, eczema prone skin and this stuff is incredible. 10 out of 10 I don't buy any other moisturizer than this. My skin is toast without this product. LOVE. * Soothes and moisturizes skin. * I absolutely love this moisturizer. I got this one by mistake a few yrs ago (the containers all lool the same) but im so glad i did! I have combination skin, very oily but dry around my mouth and chin. This evened my skin tone while healing the dry skin. I also noticed much fewer breakouts. I only use this as part of my night routine. * No comments at this time * I absolutely love this product! My skin stays supple all day. I've used the 100-hour moisture gel, and I would have to couple it with a face serum. I felt it only worked best for gripping makeup.

This is so worth the price, as a little goes a long way. * I use this daily and find it to work well.  It's not greasy, which I really like.  Your skin feels dewy even the next day.   My daughter and DIL are obsessed, so their Christmas stockings always contain a large jar!"

This product listed shea as an ingredient as does the aforementioned. Well, my skin hasn't been clearer, pores smaller, literally no makeup other than a mineral spf. I'm stunned with the results in two weeks.

Bought it on a 5x points sale (love those). Am enjoying it. I have seen a lot less dryness in my skin since I started using this. I have combo skin...T zone oil but dry around mouth corners and centers of cheeks. I'm in my early 50s. * I really like this moisturizer. I tried it for the first time and it absorbs quickly but is moisturizing gor my combo skin. * Tried a smaple out of this a few months ago and LOVED IT, was soooo excited to buy the full size. Found out after buying that they changed the formula, about a week into use my skin was ruined. Texture worse than ive ever had before. Gave me black heads, cystic acne. My skin was red irriated, and DRY. Super disappointing and returned. * The best moisturizer ever. It is light and not oily. * Was my favorite until they changed the formula.. broke out next day and had a cyst took weeks to go away"

But I am utterly disappointed. It caused severe eye irritation that i had to go see an ophthalmologist. No sunscreen has caused me such reaction so i was worreid. However i do think it's a good moistirozer with SPF but its just not for me. * This moisturizer initially feels amazing on the skin, and it worked well under my makeup. However, after a few hours, my eyes began to burn and sting! It happened on 2 separate days so i know that it is this moisturizer. Again, i really wanted to like this but it really irritates my eyes. * This is a really great SPF moisturizer. It really holds up to its name. I've been looking at this brand for months and finally got it. I've only been using this for a little under a week but this by far, has been the best SPF moisturizer I've EVER used. Someone who works at Ulta said this was a really great product; she was correct. What sold me is when she said it holds up really well for people who have oily skin, which is an issue for me so I have an issue with products that make my skin extra oily. This is very lightweight and worth the money. I just need to see how this holds up with this FL heat. * I thought this was the perfrct match for me as i am lazy and hate having to layer moisturizer with an SPF and get greasy quick. This dries down matte at first but within an hour or so is super greasy and makes my face very shiny. For the price I expected better. * I tend to find most sunscreens to be greasy, oily, or sticky even when they claim otherwise. I assumed this would be the same especially since its a sunscreen moisturizer combo. However I was wrong!  The texture and finish is so so lovely. It's very lightweight and glides on nicely, moisturizes without leaving me feeling like a shiny greasy mess! It's perfect under make too. Highly recommend! * It is weightless but it burns yours eyes terribly when you go to take it off ...and it's not sweat proof...for the almost $50 this is I expect more out of a spf moisturizer. There are drugstore brands that can offer the same for a way less price point. Definitely returning. * For some reason, every other facial sunscreen I've tried either made my face red and hot, had a sticky texture, or made my skin bumpy and textured afterwards. This is the only sunscreen without any of these issues! It feels like a regular, lightweight moisturizer in every way, and washes off easily without any texture or stickiness."

I know the reviews aren't good but; I had a  free sample of the face wash first, so I knew i would like it. I would say this if u don't like scented or oil on ur face, then pass on this. I love alot of moisturizer on my face so it doesn't bother me at all! Also I have eczema and it doesn't break me out although it's scented 😳 I love it! Love it! * Sometimes when I buy kits, I'll use most of them (but not all of them). With this kit, I use every single one of the products in here and I LOVE them! * I am SO VERY HAPPY I was able to purchase this set for my BIRTHDAY MONTH!!!!!  I am officially 51 years old.  My skin is incredibly HAPPY!!!!!  I have used TULA products for the past 6 years and when i saw this particular set on sale during the 21 days of beauty I HAD TO BUY IT!!!!!!!!  PLUS i was able to use my 20% off AND my ULTA REWARDS!!!!!!  So i got this for a STEAL!!!!!  OK so NO More bragging about me.  TULA has some of the ABSOLUTE BEST ANTI AGING AND SPECIFIC ROUTINE ADDRESSING PRODUCTS!!!!!!   I have had issues with drying skin around my mouth (upper area to chin).  And i have used everything under the sun!  However when i got to use the TULA 24/7 cream:  I WAS INCREDIBLY HAPPY!!!!!!!!!  Finally my skin is HYDRATED AND FEELING WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!  And I not oily on my forehead or nose!!!!!!!!!!  Love, LOVE TULA PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!! * This product made my oily face feel even greasier. * I did not like any product in this bundle. The facial cleanser doesn't get makeup off well. The moisturizer left my skin greasy, The brightening undereye stick didn't do anything but make my concealer go on wrong. * I love tula and a lot of there products however, definitely try one of there products before getting this bundle! I have sensitive skin and rosacea, i tried there firming moisturizer first before i bought this to see if i would have a reaction to tula products
The bundle is definitely a great deal and so far i have no issues or no break outs, its been a week! * Tula has helped my skin so much! I was scared to use it at first because my skin is so sensitive! But since ive been using i dont get big painful breakouts anymore! My skin is clear, soft, and glowing! I also used to have the little sweat bumps on my face, completely gone since using this! It did take about two weeks to see the results! So if you wait youll see the difference!

This is it! Love the clean ingredients and that it doesnt have much of a smell. My husband has even started using it, and that is saying something. * I have tried so many moisturizers. I have sensitive skin and I am also very careful with certain ingredients I use on my skin. This is the best moisturizer, it's hydrating but not greasy and great for day or night. I just mix it with my sunscreen in the morning. * I wanted to love this moisturizer because its clean- I didn't even mind the smell even though some complain about it. But I noticed after several weeks of use, I had many blackheads on my nose and chin. I didn't realize it wasn't non-comedogenic so that was on me for not paying attention. If you have acne or get breakouts, I wouldn't recommend this. * I wish the people who get the products for FREE other wise known as influencers would just be honest. I found it no big deal I've used other products for alot less money, but the 5 ⭐ crews won't be getting free stuff if they don't give a high score. Wait a few weeks to buy it and if you don't like return it, so this is an HONEST review. * Love it!! * I highly recommend this! I kept finding moisturizers that either broke me out or pilled on my face (deal breaker). This one does neither and keeps my face moisturized. It is on the pricey side, but I bought it on sale. The only thing I don't love is the smell. At first it just smells like nothing, but once I rub it in it's almost a chemical smell? Not sure, but I'll take that over not breaking me out. * It goes on like silk and makes your face feel soft and smooth. Feels good after I put on my toner and serums and then it's like a nice after finish. Good smell. Overall the best moisturizer I've used. Somewhere between a gel and a cream"

As soon as I got this onto my dry hands. The crème absorbs so nicely into my skin. The scent is light and fresh. The packaging is pretty end simple. I also enjoy that it's not greasy and just feels luxurious on the skin * This cream is so good! I have never heard of this brand, but was pleasantly surprised. I feel like my skin looks brighter and smoother after using it for a week so far! * Ole Henriksen Hydrating Multi-Use Cream is a versatile, hydrating skincare product designed to deeply moisturize and nourish the skin. It can be used on the face, hands, or any dry areas of the body, making it a multi-purpose item in your skincare routine.
The cream contains a blend of nourishing ingredients such as shea butter, hyaluronic acid, and avocado oil, which work to lock in moisture and help keep the skin hydrated throughout the day.
Despite its rich hydration, the formula is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling greasy or heavy. It has calming ingredients that can help to soothe dry or irritated skin, making it suitable for sensitive skin types.addressing dryness, rough patches, and even helping to soften cuticles or hands.
The texture is creamy but not overly thick, which makes it suitable for day-to-day use.   It has a pleasant, light citrus scent, which I found refreshing.  The moisturizing and nourishing elements make it perfect for those dealing with dryness.  It's a good option for combating the harsh effects of cold, dry weather on skin.   Ole Henriksen is on the the pricier side, so this cream might be considered an investment for those on a budget.   All in all The Ole Henriksen Hydrating Multi-Purpose Cream is a solid choice if you're looking for an all-around moisturizer that offers hydration, nourishment, and soothing benefits for various skin types. While it's particularly well-suited for dry skin, it's versatile enough for multiple uses across your body. * The Ole Henriksen Hydrating Multi-Purpose Crème has a lightweight texture that feels luxurious on the skin and smells refreshingly clean. While it contains beneficial ingredients like glycerin and shea butter, it didn't quite meet my hydration needs for very dry skin, leaving me wanting more. I appreciated the inclusion of vitamin E and botanical extracts, which added a soothing touch to the formula. The packaging is sleek and sturdy, making it easy to travel with and store without any mess. Its scent is light and subtly floral, adding a touch of indulgence without being overpowering. Overall, it's a pleasant product, but it might work better as a layering moisturizer rather than a standalone solution for very dry skin. * leaves skin moist.  love this * Bought this for my husband. He's not quick to be very excited about skincare products but he was about this one. It has transformed his super dry skin to a moisturized skin. He uses it every day and it actually made his skin less bumpy and more smooth. The texture is rich to the touch, yet doesn't take forever to sink into the skin. He applies it once a day and that's enough to keep him from feeling dry on the face. This product did not have a bad reaction to his eczema."

I never made a skincare smoothie in this, so I know it wasn't another product. The product inside is too watery and does not moisturize your skin. * I was having issues with shiny, greasy-looking skin so I was looking for a lightweight moisturizer, and this worked perfectly. It's plenty moisturizing, and gets absorbed right away. Feels very nice, with almost no scent. * It was amazing! * I have very very oily skin and this mositurizer keeps it my skin from getting greasy feeling during the day. It also has done a pretty decent job of keeping it moisturized without any dry spots or flaking. Will repurchase especially since its a great price point. * I love the moisturizer.

Would love to try the mist also * As other reviewers said it causes little white pumps on my t zone area and it doesn't do anything. * This product is very moisturizing I have been using this for 2 weeks and it's amazing * not a bad moisturizer but not the greatest either. its great for warmer weather since its lightweight and doesnt make your skin greasy. the moisture doesnt last all day through the colder weather though. * not a bad moisturizer but not the greatest either. its great for warmer weather since its lightweight and doesnt make your skin greasy. the moisture doesnt last all day through the colder weather though. * I was looking for a hydrating moisturizer that would not leave my skin looking oily but I'm still seeing some dryness around my problem areas

She is located in North Texas! * I stopped buying moisture surge (and clinique in general) earlier this year, and searched for a comparable moisturizer all of 2024. Out of the 15 products I tried this year, this has been the best option by far. I honestly think this gel moisturizer is even better than Clinique's because it's fragrance free and 100% cruelty free. So many moisturizers are also too heavy for my sensitive and acne prone skin, but this is so lightweight and absorbs quickly. It's definitely worth the price, and a little goes a long way. * This is so light and so hydrating, it does not leave any sticky residue on the skin and no harsh smell. It cools the face and gives it a nice glow * I'm in my mid 40s, with sensitive combination skin, and this gel cream has been absolutely fantastic!  My previous moisturizer was a bit too heavy, and this one is just right for day and night use!!! * This product is going back! It was recommended to me because they were out of stock of my go-to product (a different brand). Upon applying a thin layer of Tula 24-7 Weightless Moisture Day & Night Gel Cream to my face and neck, something instantly felt off. The texture was fine so I couldn't place what it was. A minute or so later it started - the slight face burning. Minutes passed and it got to the point I couldn't ignore it and had to wash my face yet again just to get it off! * I received this as a free sample and now I'm hooked. It works so great for my skin. It leaves it refreshed without being heavy. Other moisturizers can be too thick but this is thin and blends perfectly. Worth the purchase!"

My only complaint is I wish P&L would get rid of the jar packaging. * Tried this brand/cream and was content with it. It moisturizes OK but leaves a slightly sticky residue on the surface of my skin which i did not like when it dried. I still prefer my Laneige water bank cream because its similar price/size, feels more hydrating and no sticky residue. I would probably not buy this again because i prefer another brand. * This is actually a really good moisturizer, and at a way better price then a lot of other ones out there. Very thick and moisturizing, i wouldnt recommend for someone who gets greasy easily. Great for very dry skin and in the winter. * I was on the hunt for a hydrating moisturizer and while this certainly fit the bill, if you, like me, have congestion-prone skin, I would recommend looking elsewhere. This feels lovely and hydrating but the clogged pores on my cheekbones don't lie."

Woke up the next morning to the bottom half of my face covered in small bumps. * So far so good * Product Pills not just with makeup but without anything. Would not buy again. * been using this for 2 years and always go back do it. Its not greasy, lightweight, and has never caused me to break out like others. a staple facial moisturizer * Love it * Double repair moisturizer lives up to its claim. My skin felt immediately healthier and really retained moisture! Would recommend to annoying looking for really good moisturizer."

I have tried many moisturizers and I have finally found one that works! * the product seems good but if you know what some of the ingredients in this does to your body you will not want to apply this to your skin ever.. lots of endocrine disruptors which is thyroid issues along with a host of others.  some of the ingredients have to be authorized for manufacture to continue use. * I got some of this with a Lancome gift. I love the way it moisturizes and doesn't leave a greasy feel. Skin on my face feels so soft all day long. Had to buy a full size and now the gift one is in my travel bag. * My mother bought this product and I noticed it had a strong fragrance to it. Now I'm not a dermatologist, but I have enough knowledge to know that anything fragrance is horrible for your skin. Anyway, my skin broke out in hives when I tried this product, along with acne. Please don't buy skincare from Lancome, it's not the best for most people. * I love how this looks on my skin! It's matte but hydrating. Happy that it has hyaluronic acid as well. My makeup looks so good now! I used to use tatcha but didn't like oily it made my skin look. This will now be my go to! * I have normal to dry skin, but a lot of moisturizers will clog my pores if i sleep in them. I just stopped wearing a mositurizer to bed altogether for a while for this reason. When I saw the ingredients in this I became curious and decided to give it a try. My skin is so hydrated and looks beautiful in the morning! Also, if i develop a blemish during the day, I will still slap this moisturizer on top of it at night and not only does it not make it worse, it actually heals it and my skin clears up so much faster! Highly recommend this product. * This was recommended to me by the consultant and I love it."
79,good molecules,lightweight daily moisturizer,pimprod2023937,2582316," * This is a good, scent free moisturizer. It sinks in quickly and leaves my skin hydrated. * My skin loves this moisturizer and drinks it up! A small dallop goes a long way, allowing for the bottle to last awhile. It is very lightweight, I have been using it for 3 weeks and my skin is soft and hydrated. I love how affordable it is, considering there is a plethora of steep moisturizers in this store! 

I would not recommend using this product if you have sensitive skin. My good friend tried it out and was dissapointed to discover it gave her face a burning sensation (as did Good Molecules Hyaluronic Acid Serum). * I have extremely dry skin, and this moisturizes it so well. Bonus points, it doesn't peel with make up. * Didn't cause any breakouts or anything but did not moisturizer even a single bit. My face was rlly dry and dull when wearing this. Wouldn't rlly recommend tbh:( * This is the perfect lightweight moisturizer that feels creamy but doesnt make me an oily mess by the end of the day. I like trying new products so I very rarely repurchase items, but dare I say this is my holy grail daily moisturizer! * I use this moustrizer along with their hylauronic acid serum, and it works great! * I really like this moisturizer. I love that it comes in a tube, is super lightweight, smells great and leaves my face feeling hydrated all day with no greasy residue. Also love that it's less expensive than my regular choice, which is a little heavier than this. I might be a convert!"

I bought this at ulta thinking it would help my dry, sensitive skin but it in fact does not leave my skin moisturized and it caused my skin the breakout severely. * Very good moisturizer and especially love that it is fragrance free! * I have been trying to find something to help my skin, but this actually did !!! * My facial skin looks and feels so soft and hydrated. No breakouts. * Normally use the Neutrogena Hydro Boosf water gel but decided to pick this elf cream up at ulta on a whim to try. It's a few dollars less than Neutrogena.. this elf cream hydrates well for me, I have sensitive acne prone skin. I have been using for 1 week now and noticing a few acne spots from this product and sadly chemical burns forming. Thought it was just mg skin barrier having issues but my face absolutely stings and is beet red in large patches. I suggest to tread light and do a patch test! Sadly this made my skin very hydrated and feels very luxurious but for me.. at what cost"

It can be for young skin too, and it's hydrating & light on skin , but the only thing I personally dont like is that it only lasts a few minutes on the skin its a good-affordable moisturizer tho ! * I love this product it make my skin feel smooth and fresh  l also got this product for a friend waiting to hear back from my friend Excellent product also love the price and size I would recommend this product to more friends and family also easy to order at ulta where I get points on rewards membership * This is the only moisturizer that has really worked for me. I had stopped using it because I thought it was breaking me out (turns out it was another product) but went back to it when I did have a really bad breakout and it completely cleared it! * i feel like i barely need a primer, it's so good! hydrated and softened my skin so well * this is my favorite face moisturizer. it's decent price for a face moisturizer, and i've never noticed any issues after using it. it does it's job, and I love how lightweight it feels on my face. plus, it lasts so long for a small bottle. * I started using this product as my face tends to be oily and at the very beginning, it was working perfectly - not oily residues for sure. Issue is, after a while of daily use, my skin would feel dry; even patchy. Wouldn't wear underneath make-up, for sure. * I was using the glow watermelon and it was alright but my skin now is so soft and looks so healthy and it really glows without feeling greasy or making me look super oily"

I have used this cream for about a month and the fragrance is too much for me. I will continue to use it but wish there was a fragrance free version. * I have used this product for years, it clears my face leaves it smooth and young looking. I recommend this product * I bought the Lancome holiday gift pack with this included. Otherwise I don't think I would've ever bought it. Out of the entire set this is the one I use consistently because of the way it feels. Woke up today and forgot I used to have age spots. They're gone. * This has a strong perfume smell.  I bought it half off during days of beauty.  Reviews are good but that strong perfume smell.  might use it on chest instead of face to use up. * Ive tried a lot of face creams, this is definitely in my top 3. This cream is ideal for mornings where you want something moisturizing but not too oily. I can also see a difference in brighness and fine lines. I also feel like this cream works with most skin types. I have dry skin and it works well as a day cream. * About two months ago I received a super sample of this and I was SHOCKED at the difference in my skin within 48 hours. My fine lines were already fading and my skin was taught. At 46 years old I've tried every serum and moisturizer, including high end brands such as Sunday Riley and Drunk Elephant only to be left with little to no results and wasted money. This particular line of Lancome products is expensive and beyond my normal budget but it is worth every penny. I just started using the serum and these products have changed my life. I will always look for the best sales and discounts but if I would pay full price because this moisturizer is magic and now a permanent staple in my skincare routine and I HIGHLY recommend this for all women my age and up in need of help fighting fine lines and wrinkles and skin elasticity. * This product has improved the appearance of my skin without causing any breakouts. I love the texture and it has a pleasant smell to it"

I've tried a lot of different brands and this is awesome for texture and fine lines and wrinkles!  Let my friend try it last night and she loved it also! * I saw looking to try something new. The duo smells nice and feels jice going on. Howecer this juice was not worth the squeeze and the dispenser clogged easily and often. * I went to buy a product that was highly recommended. The store associate introduced me to the Juice line, and it is the first product line that I honestly felt almost instantaneous results. * I started with the samples and i was really hoping I would hate it since it is so expensive. Unfortunately I loved it, and now I'm forced to spend a fortune on skincare. Use with their vitamin c, primer, foundation and translucent powder and your aging face will thank you, but your bank account won't. * I love juice beauty's products so I couldn't wait to try this product! I used it night cream the first night I got it and woke up and washed my face and placed on the day cream. Moments afterward my face began to feel very itchy and uncomfortable. If I would itch it would leave scratch welts all over my face (what it looks like when a dog jumps up and scratches you is the best way to describe it), followed by an itchy sensation from my head to my toes. Once I would itch I would get little hive bumps and the scratch welts all over my body. Very sad this product did not work out for me, but wanted to warn others that have sensitive skin. * This moisturizer is very thick and seems to be a great product with the exception of the smell. It is a vibrant apple/lemon like a candy. 
Reminds me of a teenage type product, unfortunately it is to potent to use at night, to try to fall asleep it just keeps me up. * I love both the day and night moisturizer. The day is light and great under makeup, the night is thicker and really hydrates my skin. They also smell great!"
84,fresh,rose deep hydration face cream,pimprod2025112,2584148," * I wanted to love this moisturizer because I've loved other products from Fresh and I love the scent, but it was very disappointing. I used it at night after my full routine, and noticed within about 30 minutes that my skin felt tight (not moisturized). It was like the product had dried into a layer sitting on top of my skin. The next morning my skin didnt feel well-hydrated at all, in fact I had dry patches in areas that would typically be fine with previous moisturizers I've used. Unfortunate for the high price point, but maybe it's just not for me. * I really really wanted to love this moisturizer because of the texture, fragrance and overall feeling when putting it on but the peeling is crazy! For the price this product should not be peeling off pf my face within 5 minutes of me putting it on. Love the texture + fragrance but hate the peeling. * I havd been using this for a while now and it pills like drazy after it dries down - which translates on the makeup since it comes off when you apply. I know its not my skin since i exfoliate - so it shouldn't be doing this. I'm disappointed. * This product is very drying to me. I have used much cheaper products that made my skin feel way better than. Def wont be repurchasing * Immediately pills and doesnt layer other products well. I was really excited to try this:/ * This is one of the best moisturizers I have used. I use tretinion as my retinol and it tends to make my skin dry and flaky. I don't have that issue using this product. I see a lot of people complain about the strong rose scent. It think its delightful and doesn't linger too long but you have to understand what the product is derived from which rose petals snd buds. I use it day and night it I have seen improvements in my skin texture. * Got this on sale to try out some other moisturizer options (go-to is Peach&Lily matcha pudding). The texture is wonderful, and I do think it helped with my dry/sensitive skin, but I am not personally a huge fan of the strong fragrance."

This is the best product I have found so far. Goes on easy, absorbs and doesn't leave a sunscreen residue. Leaves my face feeling soft and make up goes on easy after. Bonus for smelling good!!! Not a lot of product for the prices is the only downside. * My dermotologist  has not needed to treat as many pre-cancer spots on my face since using this product. * This product burned the skin under my eyes creating blisters.  I have never had this problem and I d not have sensitive skin. * I love this sunscreen because I have oily/sensitive/acne prone skin and this sunscreen works well with my skin. It is a small tube but I love it and the ingredients are excellent they are noncomedogenic! Lovely sunscreen :) Thank you so much Lancome ! * this is product is heavenly only downside is the price! * I wish for the money this cost that it wikld have more product. * Let me start by saying the formula itself is beautiful: lightweight, offers a healthy glow without looking greasy, smooths out texture, and plays nicely with my sensitive/rosacea-prone skin. I should be a big fan BUT…

Why the heck does it smell like tires??! I've had it on for ~3 hrs and the rubbery smell still lingers. Hard pass!"

I really like it and I feel it smooths the skin and helps prevent sun damage. * I absolutely love this stuff and cannot understand the negative reviews.  Great tint, high SPF, and easy to apply.  Best of all, it does not burn my eyes!!  I apply it alone to my neck after serums and moisturizer but do mix with my foundation when I apply to my face. * I was given the sunscreen by my mom try, but after a few weeks of using it I notices it made my skin extremely dry. It also caused my make up to separate even when allowing 15 minutes to dry before applying foundation. I've increased my moisturizer usage hoping that would help offset the dryness, but it has not helped at all. This sunscreen has an odd smell to it. * I've had such a hard time finding a face sunscreen that didnt mess with my skin or makeup and this is it! I'm obsessed with how easy it is to apply after my skincare and it was no issue at all with my makeup after application! It doesn't have a typical sunscreen smell. I will say, for someone like myself who had oily combo skin, this might be a hit or miss for you, but for myself personally I didn't mind it at all :) * My sister-in-law got this and I've always wanted to try it and have it my own and I love it 😊 * Smells terrible and goes on like flaky paste. Overall gross feeling. Very dissatisfied. * I've tried countless sunblocks, most of which caused me breakouts and I usually hate the way they feel on my skin or smell. This one is my GOAT. It layers well over my other skincare and makes a great primer for makeup. I always repurchase this."

It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy! * I can't believe it took me so long to find this amazing product. I will have it a part of my skin routine forever now! Such a great lotion for my whole body. Highly recommend purchasing if you have dry and sensitive skin. Game changing product so excited I found it! * As someone with dry and flaky skin, I've tried countless lotions over the years, but none have worked as effectively as this one.

The lotion has a rich, creamy texture that absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. My skin feels immediately hydrated and smooth after applying it."

Everytime i put it on, it burned my face. I thought maybe it was one of the other serums i had on that was having a reaction to, but slowly began to realize it was this moisturizer. I am not experiencing a rash in my eye areas and cheeks. * I have combination, sensitive skin. I generally use a light weight moisturizer daily after showering and sometimes at night when I actually bother to wash my face. It's always worked great but I was experiencing a little bit of dryness so I decided to try this. It didn't irritate my skin at any point but it also didn't moisturize my skin. Trying to wear makeup only magnifies the dryness/flaking (and it's a hydrating CC cream). * I like to wear this at night. I put it on as the last step to my routine at night. It locks everything in beautifully and my skin feels nice and soft in the morning.

I've never tried it on under makeup as I light lighter creams under makeup. * I got this on fab fit fun box.  I tried it numerous times on face, neck and hands. It pilled on my skin every time! It looked horrible under makeup. It is too thick!  Never again  i usually like these products.

It smells good and the consistency is nice
For those 2 reasons I will give it a 5 Star

90,belif,the true cream - moisturizing bomb,pimprod2043261,2619877," * I bought this as I was searching for an affordable dupe of the Tatcha moisturing cream. This is really close to it as it is hydrating, leaves your skin feeling and looking supple, and decent price point. Korean are known for their products and this one does not disappoint even during the winter dey weather, it hydrates and sits well under makeup.

Only con to me is the packaging. I wish it came in a tube for easier travel. * Got this as a freebie and I absolutely love it! I purchesed a bigger size. Its soo cooling and hydrating. Doesnt pill like some moistureizers and isnt sticky. * I have used this product for several year and loved it, but the new formula is drastically different and makes my skin burn and leaves my skin feeling greasy. The scent used to be a natural herbal scent, but now smells like chemicals. So sad and disappointed, I would've stocked up on the original formula if I'd know they were going to ruin it! * I'm not sure why rhis doesn't habe more reviews this is the best moisturizer ever. I the cream on in the fall/winter and the aqua one in the summer. * I got this as a freebie, but I love it! It's so moisturizing, and makes me look so glowy! I feel like an angel 😂 * Love this moisturizer! Absorbs right into my skin doesn't feel heavy or greasy on my skin. I have dry skin. It helps a whole lot with my redness and exema. Would definitely recommend!! * Ive always had issues with moisturizers not keeping my skin hydrated through out the day/night, and most ive used are so oily theyve causes acne. I tried this one as a sample ulta sent me and immediately repurchased. Im on my 4th one from the last 8 months so my only complaint is i wish they sold a larger size. A staple in my skin care!!!!"

I will be purchasing more as time goes on. * The pump on my bottle is damaged, it continues to leak, so had to take pump out. I emailed philosophy and they claim it is impossible to replace. So not very happy that I have a 22 oz bottle of face cleanser that will last me for months, but no pump to dispense it. * I've been using the Philosophy skin care line for a very long time. They have changed the formula for the cleanser and the microdelivery and I'm not loving the new formulas. I just bought the 22oz with a pump to put by my sink. It makes a total mess. Every time I use it there is a blob of leakage on the sink so much wasted product. Guess thats what happens when they water the formula down. * It's my favorite cleanser! It leaves my skin super  clean without drying it!
The best cleanser! * One of the best make up removers, melts the make up off your skin * I was reading the comments trying to gauge this oroducts effectiveness for the price point and kept seeing references towards this product being a makeup cleaner/ face cleaner?

Wish I would have just gotten the new night mask. * I feel like I've tried hundreds of different moisturizers. Many sit on top of my skin or feel heavy especially once you add sunscreen on top. This product absorbs quickly and actually makes my skin feel and look plumped. It also feels cool which I like a lot and has a clean, non-offending scent. It's a thick cream that's soft & pillowy and improves my skin's overall appearance. * I started with the sample.  I loved it.  Very creamy.  A little goes a long way. * I was concerned about the switch to a new line of creams as I've been using the old smart night cream for years as a night cream, but overall have been satisified with the change. I'm 29 and was recommended by an Ulta employee in the store the lifting face + neck cream. The cream is a completely new product. It is thicker, much firmer texture than the old one. It is also bright white. It does not have a noticeable fragrance. (The jar says fragrance free). I use it as a night cream and can definitely see and feel the difference in 'firmness' and 'lifting' in my neck; although I didn't think I really needed it and that wasn't why I used the original night cream. I have noticed some white heads in my forehead/T-Zone, but I tend to get them occasionally anyway so I can't blame the cream on it. After reading about the other variations, I wish I had the SPF version so I can try wearing it twice a day with my makeup over it. I'll be giving this one to my mom and trying the SPF one next. :) * This is returnef the plumpness to my cheeks has lifted my laugh lines and I don't look as sallow under my eyes. This cream is amazing I thought I needed a facelift but after using this clinically proven product were 100% of women saw results I'm in love. I've never had more compliments on my skin and I'm 62. * Been using new product for 3 weeks, so far not real happy also higher price . * I love this face and neck cream.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.  I like that I can also use for my neck."

Plus my skin still felt moistureized. Also, I really love the pump so it does not ruin the efficacy of the rest of the product. 10/10 * I have purchased this product before and especially like the way it controls the amount needed on the top. It also is a fantastic retinol seum in cream! Goes on smoothy and feels good on the skin. * I buy this It product when it is on sale,  as the product itself is OK.   HOWEVER, I wish they would change the pump lid....it works a few times and then stops.  You end up having to unscrew it just like a normal jar to get the moisturizer out.  It needs to stop wasting money on these lids and quit trying my patience.  A NORMAL Lid is preferred to one that quits working. * I love this serum!! It feels really good on my face and i see a small difference in my wrinkles * I have sensitive skin and use this daily. I see the results within hours. My skin feels tighter. My pores are reduced. After a few days all the pores and blackheads on my nose almost gone. The fine lines on my forehead and undereyes have diminished. * Product is incredible.

I've used it for years along with their gentle face wash. * I have extremely sensitive skin and live in a dry climate. I have tried multiple moisturizers ranging anywhere from more natural, low-ingredient to high-end, dermatologist grade. Everything either made me breakout, left my skin red and still dry, and in some cases even caused chemical burns. I've tried brands like CeraVe, Ethique, Clinique, Dermalogica, etc. and none seem to help. After doing some research, I saw others say this low-ingredient, fragrance-free moisturizer helped them. After only a few uses, I was AMAZED!! My skin stayed hydrated all day, was noticeably less red, and wasn't breaking out. 
I would say maybe start with the lotion if you're on the oily side or live in a more humid climate. But as someone with already dry, sensitive skin and living in a dry climate, this has worked WONDERS. Cannot recommend enough. I hope the formula never changes! * This was a highly recommended product on tiktok so of course i had to try it out. Its a good price for the amount you get, but not a good moisturizer in my opinion. The product did not absorb at all, sat on top of my skin all night, quite sticky, and made it impossible to get comfortable since my hair would get stuck to my face if i moved. Product also had an unpleasant smell. * I love that it's moisturizing, but having super sensitive skin like I do, I was expecting it to not make my face break out in a rash. * This product is awesome and helped soothe my daughters eczema on her hand * I purchased this becauae of a tiktok I saw. I thought it would be okay to use on my face even though I have ""normal"" skin because this is a product for ""sensitive"" skin, meaning it would be okay for any skin type (so I thought). I broke out after 2 days of using it. I don't normally breakout, so when a whole patch of zits popped up on both my cheeks and forehead, I was so confused. I stopped using it 
after another day because I knew nothing else I was using caused this since everything I normally use hasn't caused this reaction. After about 3 or 4 days, everything cleared up and I am now going to return this. Lesson I took away from this, don't buy everything you see someone asvertising on tiktok! * I was influenced from tiktok and was so excited to not spend so much money on skincare, but this left me with the worst acne I've ever had in my life.

It goes on super shiny and does not get absorbed into the skin, and I have oily skin as is, so I end up looking ridiculously oily and shiny all day.  Might be fine for someone with very dry skin but avoid if you're combo or oily * Fabulous product. * Was part of GWP. Nasty ingredients. Chemical sunscreens, BHT and more. Will be tossing this GWP. * Love this product * I really like the night cream and the serum from this product line. However, the day cream has a super strong chemical spf scent and really burned my eyes. I kept thinking it was my eye makeup or just allergies but tested it today with no eye makeup and my eyes almost immediately started watering and burning. I washed my face, put a different moisturizer on and was just fine. Sorry but not sorry—this went in the trash. * I read the description and automatically wanted to try it. 
It has broke me out so bad. Face, forehead, neck. I know it has SPF in it, but it actually just feels and smells like only sunscreen."

vanicream vitamin c + cerave gel moisturizer + hero cosmetics force shield spf. 

it made my sensitive, skin happy all summer. I'm going to keep it going the rest of the year. * Great, light weight moisturizer for summer months.  Non greasy, and absorbs quickly.  No residue on my hands.  My face feels hydrated and soft all day long.  Would highly recommend and I plan to re-purchase for next summer!  (I need something heavier for winter months as I have very dry skin). * I enjoy this product - I feel like it does moisturize my face, and I love how it makes my skin feel. However, I feel like it could be just a little better. I find I need to use more than one pump, and I don't understand why I should need to use that much moisturizer. It does work, though. I'm curious to see how long the tube lasts! * Evryone seems to like this but i really dont it burns when i put it on and i feel like it may be worsening my acne im going to try the cera ve pm moisturizer and am one and hopefully those r better * I hate feeling greasy. This moisturizer really penetrates my skin and leaves it feeling soft and good!! I cannot stress this enough, I have tried soo many moisturizers and I really like this one a lot. * moisturizing but doesn't sit well under sunscreen or foundation...pills up. * I bought this because of all the positive reviews but man I am disappointed… I liked the feeling of the product itself but it did not moisturize my skin and burned when applying it. It also pills WITH other cerave products which shocked me."

Not too heavy but covers perfectly. * It contains 3 highly pore-clogging ingredients for acne prone skin! Alcohol, shea butter, and coconut! Beware if you have acne. I tried it once and it broke me out! Now I've spent weeks trying to clear up my skin. * I went into Ulta looking for a new, clean face cream, eye cream and face tint. Ended up buying all of that and the primer. I've been using it all for 5 days now. My skin has never been dryer!! It's all going back! Almost $300 and, for me, it's awful. * Based on the reviews, wanted to try out something new. I was in search of a better moisturizing cream. This wasn't it. First off, is it me or does it smell like Windex? The worst part, ended up with some serious cystic acne. And I'm over 60 years old! Extremely disappointed. Would not recommend."
102,elemis,pro-collagen marine cream spf 30,pimprod2004522,2545254," * I have very sensitive skin and many facial products turn it red.  Dermatologist recommended Cerave or Cetaphil so I used those products for years.  Redness went away, but my skin was always pretty dry, especially my forehead.  Thought I'd try Elemis.  Very happy to say my skin did not redden and the dryness is pretty much gone.  I also really like the smell.  Has a spa smell in my opinion.  However, I would prefer to not apply perfumes products to my face, so would greatly appreciate a fragrance-free version.  Actually surprised the fragrance hasn't caused irritation.  The other thing I wish for is more product for the price.  The packaging is quite large and heavy, but upon opening, you realize there is little product compared to the size of the container.  Despite the fragrance, which again - I do like - and the amount of product for the money, I'm definitely going to continue using this Elemis product. * I absolutely love this product and make my skin feel amazing.   I have used so many, but nothing compares to this face cream. * I found this product 3 years ago while in the Caribbean; so excited to see it available at Ulta. * I really like the texture and smell of this cream. Not sure how effective the spf 30 is as I really haven't worn it outdoors much. Found out they use this line on Disney cruises so makes it feel more special. It's definitely a splurge but I like it a lot. * I have been using this awhile now, followed a recommendation by now and gen blog, and she has flawless skin. I love that this has spf, it's not greasy or oily and my skin is SO soft. Have turned so many friends onto it, it's truly awesome. Have already repurchased multiple times. * I am 67, with skin that used to be oily, but now combo.  I just started using, but one thing I love is how soft my skin is - without feeling greasy!!! * Love this product it make my skin look better."

Love it * About an hour after application white flakes appear all over my skin especially around hairline and jawline. * After a decade of looking for the perfect moisturizer, a friend gave me a sample of this and it is divine. After I finished using the sample I decided it was worth the heftt investment. A little goes a long way. It's a superior product! * I used this clinique smart clinical repair cream n 1 eye & used estalauder revitalizing cream on the other eye for 2 weeks. I could tell more of an improvement in my crows feet w/ this product. Ive used many eye products and this is my favorite! * This moisturizer pills on freshly washed and exfoliated skin. I will be returning it. * This was thick, probably due to the spf. I didn't feel like it really soaked in to my skin.

I haven't changed any of my makeup or skincare products at all in the last 2-3 years, so I know it had to be this product. It's nowhere near as moisturizing as the old product, and has a strange jelly texture that doesn't feel nearly as moisturizing as a cream does, and has a cooling sensation similar to products with alcohol. This item might be fine for someone with normal or possibly oily skin but if you are very dry, I wouldn't recommend it. My rosacea flared up after years of calm, my cheeks are tender, my entire face peeled in tiny flakes the next day. and the lines under my eyes are much more crepey. I gave this two stars because I switched to using it on my neck and hands at night and that hasn't caused any issues, and it might just be an ingredient my skin doesn't agree with. For my face I switched to Paula's Choice skin recovery hydrating mask and it's been working better for very dry skin. I still recommend Clinique for their makeup and eye cream, though as that's never caused me any problems! * I've been using this product for years. Since I am naturally oily, I use this product at night as my final step in my skincare routine. I use it to lock in all my nighttime routine products. 10/10 would recommend. * Just starting my second jar, and I love it. It makes my skin feel moisturized but not greasy. It's light but it keeps my skin soft and smooth even with cold winter weather and dry conditions inside. * I finally found a great moisturizer that doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy, absorbs quickly, doesn't cause breakouts, and literally leaves my skin baby smooth. Moisture surge has blown me away. I've tried a good bit of clinique moisturizers and really disliked them all until trying this one. I'm a 32 year old mother of 4 and for the first time in years, I was complimented on the appearance of my skin. This will be my go to from now on! I've been recommending it any chance I get. * So smooth! It is like a drink for your face! * The lid to my container came crooked and can't be screwed on properly. Looks like it was warped during manufacturing. You get a very small amount of product for what you pay for. * I use this on my face,but,more importantly,my hands. They were cracking open with wintertime dryness. They look perfect. I love it on my face. I put it on my arms,and legs. It is silk in a jar. I love the real glass jar also. A product that works."

It does have a strong scent to it, but I don't mind it and it hasn't irritated my acne prone skin or caused any reactions. I could see myself repurchasing this once I'm out. * I love spf moisturizer but I feel like most of them are heavy and greasy. This one isn't. It feels light and my skin doesn't feel dry like it normally does in the winter. I also have sensitive skin and there's no irritation or breaking out. * Yes I would buy it again. * I got this a couple months ago and LOVE THE PRODUCT but the packaging is just bad. It broke less than a month into use:/ * This was the only change to my routine. The day after my 1st use I broke out in hives. 3 days later I'm still dealing with them. Be cautious. There are several active ingredients that are not approved by the FDA. FYI, I've never had hives before. * It burns my eyes after awhile but not when applying. Light and fresh, but the lid broke. * Love using this face cream in the morning since it has spf 30 and perfect on the go. It's texture is creamy and thick which gives off a beautiful glowy/dewy look. The only problem I have is to be careful when applying around my eyes because it starts to get in my eyes and stings. Might be a personal thing but idk, that's my personal review of this product."
109,cosrx,hyaluronic acid intensive cream,pimprod2004959,2542834," * I've been using this moisturizer for the past 8 mo. day & night. It's super hydrating and absorbs into the skin nicely. I have combination skin & live in Chicago- no issues so far in the winter / summer temps. I'm obsessed and a jar lasts forever. * Bought this brand for the first time last year and I like the way my skin feels! I haven't seen any improvements yet but my skin hasn't gotten any worse either! * I use this cream at night with the ma:nyo bifida ampoule and the first aid beauty retinol 0.3% serum. I think it has really helped repair my skin barrier and does not break me out unlike most moisturizers. I suggest giving it a try if u have combination skin bc it is rlly in the middle of a gel and cream. I wouldnt suggest it for super dry skin bc the texture isnt super thick, and not for oily skin bc its not gel like. But for combination acne prone skin its a holy grail! * really moisturizing, hydrating and smooth consistency (great for those oily or dry or combo skin).

i almost never write a review for a product unless i'm telling people to stay away from it, but i struggle with hormonal acne and my skin barrier is really damaged; when i use this product i notice my skin is like heavenly lol no exaggeration * I really love Cosxr products. This one is just ok for me. I used it at night. My issue is it doesnt seem to absorb into the skin, just my pillow case. I much prefer the birch sap moisturizer over this one. I will use it but wouldnt purchase again. * I LOVE this moisturizer. I have dry skin. My skin soaks it up and it is my go to nighttime moisturizer. Every person I have recommended it to has loved it as well. The ONLY con is that it has pilled under my makeup before which is why I only use it at night. If you are not someone who wears makeup you will not have this problem!! * This moistureizer is amazing on its own, but if you have eczema I recommend mixing it with the advanced snail 96 mucin power essence!! Its a beautiful combonation!! Has definitely helped with my rough patches!"

Have used it along time. * Love this product.  Really does smooth bumpy dry skin. * I have tried others and so far this one is very good. Bought it for my boys. * Works wonders and helped with my bacne * My dermatologist recommended CeraVe SA for my psoriasis flare ups and it's been very helpful.  I prefer it to using steroids or other topical prescriptions whenever possible.  Great product. * Super expensive… but this is the only lotion that doesnt cause breakouts on my back and I actually notice the amount of back breakouts have lessened when i use this. 
Makes my skin feel really soft instead of just coated. * I could have sworn I remembered this being a holy grail product for the acne on my back and shoulders, and I also remembered it being significantly less expensive than it is now. Now, it contains mineral oil and has done nothing to help my body breakouts - in fact I feel more greasy and more broken out than before! Works okay for other parts of my body less prone to acne (like fighting ingrown hairs on legs, etc) but it's just too expensive for the ingredients list now."
111,murad,oil and pore control mattifier broad spectrum spf 45 pa++++,pimprod2007193,2547796," * This is fine on its own for a workout, but it pills horribly if you put any makeup on top. No oil control. Very thick formula that does'nt spread easily, so you'll go through the tube very quickly. * I have oily, sensitive skin so it is very difficult for me to find a daily sunscreen. Finding this has changed my life! * I have oily, sensitive skin so it is very difficult for me to find a daily sunscreen. Finding this has changed my life! * I was hoping this product would help my face but it does absolutely nothing to mattify my skin. Within 3 hours of wear my face is as slick as an ice skating rink. Smashbox makes a much better mattifier (IMO) and I'll stick with that * Feels nice but doesn't mattify, especially after wearing for several hours * I have used many SPF products and this is far the best one ! Leaves my face feeling smooth and not oily , can't wait to buy more soon !! * Put this on your face in the morning, show yourself some TLC and enjoy a cup of coffee and relax for five minutes, then go put your makeup on. If you don't wait to apply your make up until the spf dries a bit, it ends up rolling together and making patches with your makeup. If you do wait, I personally feel the results are worth it - very smooth application and it looks nice all day."

Unfortunately it did not feel hydrating at all it set on top of my skin like a greasy film and immediately began to pill off… will sadly be returning. * Great product and value. My 50 yo dry skin is loving it. My regular winter moisturizer just wasnt cutting it. This helps so much. Love! * This is incredibly moisturizing without being heavy. The big tube lasts a long time. * I live in CO and even face oils are not cutting it for keeping my skin hydrated. This moistizer is a holy grail in winter for keeping my skin consistently hydrated. I have oily skin thay tends to be dehydrated, as well as senstitive acne prone. Doesnt break me out at all * a little goes a long way. I also use it on my eye area. I have dry skin, in the winter it is upsetting how dry my skin gets. this moisturizer saved me from tears. I tried to get a lighter lotion for the summer time but was not happy when I wasn't getting the same amount of moisture so now I use this year round, just a SMALL dab. the price point and product result get 5 stars. * I spent hundreds of dollars on big name skin care but when I went to a new girl to do my facial, she recommended this brand and I absolutely love it. My skin feels silky, smooth. * This product left my face an oily mess. After putting it on I felt like my skin couldn't breathe!"

Is a mediocre product. * I wish I could afford the day cream in this brand with the sun protection SPF. But I could only afford one product so I chose this one and I'm glad I did. It's an incredible night cream. I wake up with the softest face and skin. * I was lucky to get this 50% off during Ulta sale. The more I use it the more I like it. I think its a great morning cream and it rivals the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Youth cream. It does well under makeup. Its also good for my dry skin without it being too oily for day time. I would like to try the one with SPF. * I bought this during the sale at 50% off. I think its a perfect cream for dry or combo skin. It doesn't leave my skin too greasy, but rather hydrated. * I recieved a little sample packet of this cream in an order. My skin isn't very sensitive, so I always try out samples. Nice way to discover new products!

After using this product, I had to double check to make sure I wasn't using a cream cleanser. The frangrance threw me off; It smells heavily of soap to me. Like bar soap. I wouldn't perchance this for myself, because I feel like I need to rinse off. However, I love the consistency and would like it very much if it didnt have that soapy smell. :/ * I want to love it bevause its so moisturizing but its very heavily perfumed and makes me breakout * As a person with ""mature"" skin I am happy to revisit this product. I tried it several years ago and it was too much for my skin but these days it is perfect. It's works well under make up and I also use it at night over serums."

She used this and almost immediately said it started to burn! We washed off quickly but it caused her face to become extremely flushed and hot. 
Read the ingredients and found it contains cinnamon bark extract!!! Why in the world would there be cinnamon in a MOISTURIZER Marketed towards youths?!? I would have never even thought to read the ingredients on a hydrating product for ingredients that burn. Needless to say we will be returning! * having sensitive acne prone skin makes it hard trying new products, but i'm so glad i listened to the reviews! this mask leaves your skin so smooth and hydrated and it didn't break me out! highly recommend coming from a licensed esthetician :)"

I use A-Passioni cream and the A-Gloel every day with a dollop of the A-Shaba on the eyes and I am good to go with a little spf. Keeps my skin feeling moist and smooth all day with no burn (I am not a retinol beginner).  Love these produxts, and yeah the funky smell and texture is because these are clean products instead of chemicals! ❤️❤️❤️ * I've been through 3 bottles and haven't noticed any significant difference in my skin. It was helpful when I had some breakouts in clearing them in a timely manner, but other than that, nothing. I decided to branch out recently and try another retinol product from a different brand, and I'm realizing what I've been missing out on, and at a lower price point! Overall, I don't hate it, but it really did nothing for my skin. * I love it! I have a combination skin. My t zone always gets oily with white heads. I started using it last year and it really helped clear and brightened up my face. I continue to use it since it keeps white heads away and oiliness at bay. * Love the way it leaves my skin feeling.  I wasn't going to try but had to check it out.  And it was definitely worth my gold coins. * Smaller than the free samples it came with * It is a strong product that must be used as directed. If used properly it will reveal a brighter, better looking skin. * No negative side effects even using it overnight. But I noticed absolutely no difference in my skin after 2 months. It's way too expensive to not show any improvements."

The consistency is just perfect, not too greasy and absorbs well into skin. Wish they made in larger size. * The scent is perfect and the next day you are beautiful. * Smells very nice and I use the cleanser before putting this on. I do notice after a while, I'm left with a residue that comes off despite not wearing makeup. I have mixed feeling about it because of the residue. * Really great serum. I mix it with the collagen one and it seems to be working so far. * Light weight * One of the few skincare products I've actually noticed results from. My face is slightly sticky after applying, but that eventually goes away. I'm on my 3rd bottle now, and my skin tone is more even and brighter from using this moisturizer every morning. I LOVE it."

I just wish I could get the lid off to get the last bit of product. * I have very sensitive, breakout prone, and aging skin. This is the best moisturizer that i have found and trust me… I have tried too many. My only complaint is that the product is inside a bag inside the bottle and the top doesn't screw off so i feel like im waisti g product when its two empty to pump and I can't access the insode to scrape out the remaining moisturizer. * I switched to this from the blue bottle and im so glad. It absorbs well, softens skin, and doesnt leave skin greasy or tacky. I would buy a big bottle of this. I wish it werent so expensive. * I was looking for something that might be better than the Cerave lotion I was using for a long time that had parabens in it. My skin is sensitive and lots of things tend to irritate or break me out. Nothing changed but this lotion. I don't know what's in it that did it, but I immediately started breaking out. It claims to be for sensitive skin, but I'll take the parabens over that. And they've recently taken them out. So I won't be using this lotion. * This is not gentle whatsover!!! It smells like paint thinner and Shea butter not in a good way either.. I was lit up like a red tomatoe.. horrible horrible .. stay away its not for sensitive skin.. adding cheap ingredients and hiking up prices is what most everyone is doing now days.  Nothing is of any quality only for profits.  It's already a super small bottle for a high price tag now its not even worth using if it manages the barrier too.. ughhh * I have severe rosacea and am on the hunt for an affordable moisturizer.  I currently use environ super moisturiser but it is costly. 
I bought this La Roche posay moisturizer and it burned immediately. 
my skin is still recovering as this caused my rosacea to flare up.
I guess I'm still searching for my perfect affordable moisturizer. * Literally the only moisturizer that has put my rosacea at ease. Only downside is it is quite expensive for such a small bottle."

Usually my products come in a box but this time they came packaged in a bubble mailer, which isn't the issue or a problem at all, I just noticed that was the first thing different. 
Second thing I noticed it came from the Return Center, which maybe I never paid attention to before but that for some reason stuck out to me.
Third, all my products came in perfect condition except for this one.  The top came off super easy as if the circle sticker seal on the right side of the bottle where the cap meets was already cut as if this had been tried out, returned and then re sold to me apparently.  This is just what I formed in my own opinion after opening my package.  Maybe I'm wrong, but as an avid consumer this was a different situation in my opinion and why was my seal already broken? * I have the DRIEST skin due to psoriasis and eczema. Needed a new routine that I could afford and works. My skin is now not only buttery soft, but I haven't had a flare-up since switching. I have the Jelly Cleanser, Hydrating Toner, Hydrating Serum, Rich Cream, Barrier+ Treatment and Hydrating Recovery Oil. * I use this moisturizer every morning and night and it is so good and I have been through a lot of bottles if this product and I love it I will definitely by this moisturizer again. * This moisturizer is amazing for my sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. It is so soothing and moisturizing and doesnt make me break out! * I was recently looking for a new moisturizer but nervous to try a new one because of my acne prone skin. i saw alot of recommendations for this one and ive been using it for about a month now. It is hydrating and DID NOT break me out so successful switch !! * the packaging is so efective and I recoend for dry skin * I was gifted by byoma and this moisturizer is amazing! I love how it's an AM/PM moisturizer. It's hydrating but not heavy on the skin compared to other rich creamy moisturizer. I like how it's an affordable price!"

Pretty much all skin care (except my korean spf) makes me break out. Anyway, a few days later my mom was raving about how incredibly well this moisturizer plumps her skin and fills her wrinkles. I researched this TBT cream online it found out that its a retinol alternative, which is awesome! My mom is a sun worshipper and these past two summers have left with her fine lines all over her face. She cant use traditional retinols because she has rosacea and very sensitive skin. Just bought her a full dozed jar, Mom approves it and recommends it. * Ive used clinique for years due to my sensitive skin. I am 33 years old and was looking for something new. My skin was looking dull. 

After only 4 days of using this product in the AM and PM, my skin has had a noticeable glow and plumpness to it. 

I can not rave enough! 10/10! * I love this stuff. I'm nit a big product junkie. I'm getting older and ciuld never really find affordable products to help my combination, sensitive skin.
This stuff is great. Idk what made me try it, but I'm so happy i did. I always get compliments when i remember to put it on. * I love how nourishing it feels.I have very sensitive skin and it has been working great.There's a tiny bit of a smell but not enough to bother me or keep me from buying it again, which I will be doing. * I've only used it three times so far, but it's extremely moisturizing. I have very sensitive skin so I've given it three days between uses. I usually put it on right before bed but tonight I had a couple hours and touched my face and this stuff pills like crazy. That's my only complaint, though * I wanted to love this,  but the chemical smell i can't do. Also, i dont like the fact its recommended to use at night only. I want a moisturizer that works for both day and night personally. Going back to true belief aqua bomb. * I usually don't leave reviews, but this cream is everything! I've been using it for several months now but I noticed a difference in my skin within the same week. I have very oily VERY acne prone skin with some scarring, and since I've been using this cream I've had minimal break outs which is a huge deal for me. I alternate it with Dime's blue facial oil and my skin has seriously never looked this good. I can't rave about this product and Dime skincare enough, this cream is a must-have!!!"

I tried this with the other Clarin's serums and even topped it with a vitamin C oil. I dont think it will work for winter. And, I dont see it working for a nightine cream during the winter. It would be a nice moisturizer for summer I believe if you have dry skin. 
For all the other skin types it might work well for you. * I really love this product. I've alternated between a variety of higher end brands over the last 14 years and this is my favorite, and I have tempermental skin. It's so worth it. * Smells absolutely awful. Like the most old-fashioned, cheap perfume. This is meant to be a day cream… I don't know why it smells so incredibly strong and cheap.  I also think I mistook Ulta's ""conscious beauty"" as meaning clean/good skincare.  But that is not what this is. Its full of synthetic/artificial crap… including dyes and fragrance. * I was really excited to try this cream and the first few days it was perfectly fine, until my face started to breakout really bad and still have some scars :( * This has become my go to moisturizer, it has helped with my pores and fine lines alot. I'm 52 but still get oily in my T-Zone. I am surprised by the negative reviews. Its a winner in my book * I wouldn't recommend this product for women in their late 20s-30s. Its more meant for women in their 40-50s I believe. It was too harsh on my skin. Made my cheeks have a red pigmentmentation and sometimes burned. I dont use it everyday because of it which is ashame because of the price. * I received a Clarins set as a bonus with purchase.  I first tried this products.  The fragtance is so strong snd overwhelming thst my eyes became irritated.  I am not usually sensitive to anything.  Clarins, you do. It beed to add this much fragrance.  I am afraid it might keep me from sleeping."
122,supergoop!,play everyday lotion spf 50 with sunflower extract pa++++,pimprod2029934,2589381," * If you have acne or a meduim to nromal skin then dont buy!! Made my face super oily and kinda has a weird minty feeling when applied. I did not enjoy this experience. * This product is so expensive, but i think it can be worth it. I admit it is a little sticky on my face and skin, but that never bothered me. I dont have oily nor dry skin, I glow with this sunscreen on, i put it on before my makeup and it hasnt messed with the application. It doesnt clear my skin, but i dont break out from this product. I burn easily, yet I lathered up in this sunscreen ONE TIME in the morning during a very hot summer, laying exposed under the sun all day at the beach without reapplying and i left with no burn lines or nothing. However, Im unsure about how water resistant it is. The sunscreen is easy to apply, it rubs in so smoothly. Id recommend buying in store because when I ordered online once, the seal was leaking and i had to exchange it, so i would not risk it. While i do wish this was a bit cheaper for the amount of product i get, i havent bought from another brand since i got on this once. On top of that, i love the fragrance of it, it doesnt have that typical sunscreen smell to it which is a bonus. Overall, i havent had an unpleasant experience with this product so far! * This is the best everyday sunscreen and moisturizer you can use.I have a mature skin and my skin glows from this, I have worked as a medical iaesthetician and I would recommend this to everyone.. * I had tried before form a friend and had seen really good reviews.I finally decide to purchase and plan to do so feels so light weight and it melt into skin so easily there is no shine or sticky feeling like other products I have used and have not noticed and white spots * This completely changed my kids adversity to sunscreen. They will happily apply and re-apply this like any other moisturizer. My husband also doesnt mind reapply this even at work. I took my most recent jug on a bachelorette trip and we all left glowing without sunburning. * Really happy with this sunscreen so far! Usually my least favorite part about sunscreen is how oily and greasy I feel and look, but this one dries/absorbs really nicely so I do not look like I am shining/oily from the sunscreen layer.  I also haven't had any issues with staining on clothes, which I have had issues with other sunscreens. * This sunscreen is fantastic! Unlike most sunscreens, this one doesn't have a white cast and it doesn't feel sticky. It's expensive but definitely worth the price."

It's good for mild psoriasis, gentle on flakey skin and non-comedogenic. But I don't find it better than most other moisturizers and treatments for my occasional flakes. I find azelaic acid and retinoids produce better results, so this cream doesn't add much to my skincare routine. I'll use this up, but I don't see myself repurchasing this. * I have alwasy had sensitive skin and recently i just got really bad cystic acne and needed moisturizer that didnt sting my face and this did not bother my skin at all! Dont need a lot for whole face. * I've been using this product for about a week now, and I'm not very impressed. I've been using it morning and night, and continue to have dry skin. * it feels nice on my face but it burns my undereyes and doesn't feel hydrating enough :( but it did calm my acne since this is an oil free product. so i recommend this to oily type of skin. * I've been using this and the face wash for a while now. And fully intend to continue doing so.
Sooths my skin, leaves my skin feeling so nice. Almost everything annoys my skin, these two
products are among the ones that my skin loves. * This moisturizer is awesome! I recently started a new skin care routine and one of the moisturizer I had been trying was dryinh out my skin causinh flakiness and for my eczema to pop back up on my face. It took literally two uses of this moisturizer instead and my skin feels better than ever!"

A godsend for my skin barrier * I absolutely adore this brand. I purchased the redness relief calming cream in the past and adored it but wanted something lighter as I have combination skin and this is perfect. Its a soft light moisturizer that doesnt leave me greasy or oily. Its also a fantastic moistuizing base for makeup, will certainly be repurchasing! * I've been on the hunt for a light, hydrating moisturizer since my favorite brand was discontinued, and this one ticks all my boxes. It applies smooth, absorbs fast and leaves my skin soft and happy. I do wish they had a light scent option. * this was one of my favorite moisturizers but it seems to have been reformulated. it's a lot more runny than I remember. I'm assuming it has a lot more water than the last time I've used it, which is annoying enough but it's really hard to apply now because it immediately starts running off of my fingertip * its just so good, hydrates and leaves my skin so soft without being too heavy. its perfect !!!! * I've been using this for a month now and so far, I'm loving it! It's got clean ingredients and hasn't caused any breakouts on my oily / dry combination skin. * I personally prefer this over the cosrx snail musin moisturizer. To be honest it's all up to ones preference. Neither of these products are bad, they're just made for different people. I find that this lotion paste like texture isn't too heavy, yet it doesn't absorb too fast. Compared to the cosrx snail musin moisturizer, which has a gel texture and absorbs too fast. My skin sucks it up super fast, and it's left with no benefits. In comparasent, the peach slices moisturizer leaves my skin soft and smooth. I keep on wanting to touch my face lol. I have oily skin, and I've worn this during the day. It's not horribly heavy to the point it interacts bad with my face oils. I feel as if my t zone has been pretty tame ever since I started using this product."

Firstly, it's a gel and not a cream and that should have been my first clue. It applied it and while it went on smooth, that was not the ending result. My face feels like I'm wearing a mask of sorts and my skin does not feel hydrated at all. It feels like a dry cast and during these often dry fall/winter months this is NOT what I need for my skin. 0/10 would not recommend. * works well for my combo skin in the summer.  makes my skin look healthy and hydrated and not oily which i love. the only con is that it is a little sticky on the face, but it's not super bothersome. * This is the best moisturizer for those with oily skin! I work in a hospital and this is the only moisturizer that has been able to keep my oil at bay to reduce breakouts without drying out my skin. It probably wouldn't work for those with normal and dry skin. I do have normal patches around my eyes so I use the Derma-E Skin Restore Advanced Peptides at night. Together, these are a dream team for those who want beautifully moisturized but not too oily skin that work in a hospital! 
For refernce, I have oily, acne-prone skin. I use Derma-E Acne Deep Pore Cleansing face cleanser, The Ordinary's niacinamide serum, and this moisturizer for day time plus the Derma-E moisturizer mentioned above at night time. With this combo, I have minimal acne only around where hospital masks, hairnets, etc touch. * terrible for dry skin-it made me feel even drier after application. 
pills under makeup-my lightweight foundation looked awful when paired with this moisturizer.
It also made my face red and I was very aware of it, if that makes sense. I couldn't wait to wash it off. 
I gave it to my husband who has oily skin and he seems to be having better luck. * Very moisturizing and makes my skin feel so hydrated * I live in a very humid place and dont want a thick moisturizer. This one is perfect! I notice a difference in one day that my skin feels softer and smoother and I think it really does repair the skin barrier quickly! My acne spots seem less red and the strength of my skin overall seems better!"

It so moisturizing my skin, smells so good, and feel good on skin! * The texture is very watery and gel like snd jist slides around and is very sticky. Dont like it.

It will definitely not help you in the sun but other than that GREAT PRODUCT💗 * Every time I wear it, it peels off even with nothing else on it and it smells to much like sunscreen if you want an alternative i suggest the cera ve sunscreen * my skin is very sensitive to certain sunscreens and will breakout or get tinny little bumps BUT NOT W THIS. literally life saving. * This is my favorite product I have it slides on like silk it's very lightweight and and it feels creamy on my skin the it makes my skin feel make this product number one I would definitely recommend if your looking for a good sunscreen this is the one * Decent on its own but pills terribly under makeup"

Omg! What a difference. The redness in my cheeks and by the corners of my nose went away. And my skin looked immediately brighter. The feel of the creme itself is SO luxurious and you only need a little bit so it will last a longer time (of course we want that with this price lol) * I love this product and ordered it online for a mother's day gift. However, I somehow got a refill, so it came in a plastic container with a tear-away foil cover and no jar. I didn't even know refills existed for this. I didn't have a container to place it in (other than using a cheap Ziploc bag), so it would have dried out. Hence, I had to return it. I'm not sure if others have had this issue, but Ulta, please be aware! * Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo my mom is a dermatologist and she loves it!!!!!!!! * I have been using this cream for about a month and a half. It feels pleasant and smells beautiful, but does not live up to its claims in my experience. My face does not feel fully hydrated by the end of the day, never mind 24 hours. I have not witnessed brightening or firming. A big selling point (and likely excuse for the huge price tag) is the Grand Rose extract, which Lancôme does a poor job explaining the benefit of. Luckily I had Ulta points to use on this cream, and not my own money. I got roped into the illusion of grandeur and prestige with this Absolue cream. Don't be like me. Much more effective and affordable creams are available on the market. Research ingredients; rose extract offers unremarkable and lackluster benefits. Perhaps the Pro-Xylane and shea butter can, but certainly not in this formulation. * This product is amazing! Expensive as heck but amazing. I originally tried this as a sample and noticed a difference from just the sample. My skin has NEVER felt so soft and smooth! Make sure to purchase when there's a 20% off code otherwise it's a lot. * Most say ""it softens the skin""  Goodness ladies, you can ""soften skin"" with products that are free of chemicals and work to soften.. A cream at this ridiculous price should do more than ""SOFTEN"".. I received a teeny tiny sample of it .. Sorry I don't believe one can see any difference whatsoever with 4 drops of a cream with a strong perfume smell.  I have sensitive skin and perfume is not something I want in a cream * Got sample with other Lancôme product. Best moisturizer on market. Cant tell u how many compliments I have received.

I feel perfectly hydrated without being weighed down. * Bought the full-size jar after receiving a sample. It's a nice weight without feeling heavy or greasy. Light, pleasant scent. I use it after washing my face at night. Provides ample moisture and skin smoothing and plumping overnight. * Hi Everyone!

So, I very rarely write reviews but this product deserves one. I've been using this product for a little over a week now and it's saved my skin. A little bit about me and my skin concerns: I'm 38, latina with tan skin, no wrinkles but a few fine lines around the corners of my lips. I struggle with eczema on my eyebrows, around my nose and chin. When I started using this cream, I had been dealing with a flare up that was into its 2nd week. 😫 I applied this the same night that I picked it up. Immediately, I noticed the lemony scent and silky feel on my skin. I had no stinging or burning. The next morning, MY FACE WAS CLEAR. No patches, no angry flare up. My skin was glowing and supple. It's been very hot in NJ and I've even used this twice a day with no adverse reaction. My skin looks so much better and that makes me happy. Thank you fresh for this amazing product. I love it. 🩷 * I really wanted to like this, as I tried the lotus day cream in the past and loved it! This time, I got this in the gift set from Ulta (the one you get with minimum purchase), and I am happy I didn't purchase the full size. The cream has a nice texture and smell but it made me break out terribly!!! I definitely wouldn't recommend to sensitive acne prone skin people. Very disappointing. * I have years using this cream. Ordered new one, when I applied it I did noticed the smell was different, I thought was expired. Looks like lots of customers are complaining about a formula changed ? So sad, now I have to find a replacement brand. * This became my new favorite lotion so quick! Super moisturizing but feels light still. Has the best smell ever (not too strong). Highly recommend! * i made the mistake of not doing a patch test. my face broke out from this really bad. it also has a weird strong fruity fragrance??"

It never irritating my sensitive skin and actually felt soothing. It took hours to ansorb into my skin and left a slightly greasy feel. I awoke this morning to very happy skin - hydrated, smooth, plump and slightly firmer. Once my current moisturizer is empty, I'll be purchasing. * This is my second time repurchasing. I hate the price but this has made a significant difference in my skin. I have sensitive dry skin and this has given my skin the moisture it needs and an amazing glow. I see others are complaining about it being ""greasy"" i havent had that issue. I apply two pumps to my skin and it gives me the most beautiful glow. I use everything Dermalogica and constantly get compliments on my skin. * This is one of those products that's been life changing in my routine. The way my under eyes look & feels from this product is phenomenal. This has helped with my fine lines and wrinkles. Helped firm my under eyes. Super rich lux formula. A little goes a long way. It awakens my under eyes. * I need moisture, not grease.  So sad. I will be going back to my Drunk Elephant. * Oooof..big fan of Dermalogica but not of this.

135,peach slices,snail rescue all-in-one oil free moisturizer,pimprod2018393,2567117," * Okay, i have repurchased this mosturizer prob 2-3 times. I use maybe 2-3 pea size amounts once a day at night. Redness went down with this one more than it did with the redness releif product from peach slices, so i think my skin just needed a break. The bottle doesnt last very long (around 3 months which is quite short for me, as I am a student and dont want to spend $60 a year on mosturizer lol). My last 2 bottles I noticed that overtime, if there is a little bit of product left on the tip, the packaging will degrade and the cap wont be able to turn back on. The ridges where the cap is usually secured comes off, so there is not air tight seal. Other than that, i love the product, the packaging not so much. Due to this reason, i will be looking for a new mosturizer. If you really want to try it out though, I recommend storing it upside down and wiping the cap with a clean towel regularly. I dont like doing this though because i dont like to touch the applicators of my products. * I recently got this moisturizer more than a week ago at my local Ulta store.i wanted to try something new and more affordablle for me.A few days later i started having the worst breakouts ive had in a while and my skin has been drier and flaky.This is definitely  not for my combo/oilly acne prone skin.do your research before you by this. * I was looking around ulta in store for a moisturizer and an employee came to help and recommended this. I would recommend this brand in general due to the gold ingredients. It is a very good moisturizer to keep my acne in check. * This product caused me to get little red dots on my face and caused breakouts. * This product caused me to get little red dots on my face and caused breakouts. * I have dry skin, and am allergic to some ingredients in skincare. This one at first seemed like it wasn't good for me because it'd cause my skin to tingle, but after some time it did perfectly in cleaning my face AND removing my makeup. It makes my skin feel refreshed and tighter. I use it to clean my brushes and sponges, it works perfectly everytime. If you're new to skincare, definitely give it a shot. * i bought this moisturizer because i have very oily acne prone skin and i heard it was good for my skin type. but this product is hardly even a moisturizer it feels like a serum, is super watery, and it makes me feel and look so oily. definitely going go return it, i wouldn't recommend this to anybody"

So disappointing. Why break something that has awesome reviews…it's so hard to get customers to come back after leaving. * I had a sample that I used and loved, so I decided to buy it. Well, this must have been an old sample since I saw other comments about their formula change. This version made me break out in hives and was very itchy. Have to return.

It's not greasy and has a very nice feel! * I wanted to try something different and this just wasn't for me.  It's very greasy and doesn't absorb and it made me itch terribly * I'd give it 5 stars if the price went a bit lower. I aways have to wait for a coupon to come, its expensive for a bit over an ounce.

I have combination skin.I can tell the recipe has changed I think the quality went down a bit , but still good results.  Please bring the price down

-a faithful customer- * I tend to avoid creams that have fragrence in this and this one tends to sting over cuts & dry skin in very fresh states. Other than that I love the feeling of the lotion once applies (I have a mini fridge for my cream) but I just don't appreciate that feeling around sensitive skin cells. * I am so disappointed in the formula change :( I ordered a new jar and knew immediately after rubbing it on that something was off. It's almost soapy and doesn't seem to rub in like before. It leaves a bit of white residue too. I've been loyal to this moisturizer for so many years. My skin is not doing well and I'm worried I've developed a bit of an allergic reaction which is actually how I originally came to find this moisturizer. I am so saddened to have to now search for another moisturizer when my skin doesn't do well with most creams. This used to feel luxurious and almost silky. Not anymore!"

Its also THD Ascorbate. * nice * I am a redhead with freckles and sun/age spots. I bought this cream to use on ny face both for the SPF and to fade freckles. My skin had some sensitivity issues a couple weeks after I started using the product - redness, small blisters and peeling. It might've been this product, might not, but i still have not recovered. Waited too long to return it and so I started using on my neck and chest without issues. I wear a lot of V-neck tops, and noticed my freckles and dark spots faded surprisingly quickly! I'm not sure if I will buy it again, but it DOES work. On the downside it has an unpleasant citrus scent. Im not usually bothered by scents but I'm not fond of this one. * Left my skin greasy and shiny but did not moisturize my skin. Would not recommend to use, did not see any improvement in my skin just felt like putting oily sun screen on my face."

My face was bot staying hydrated for even 8-9 hours after application. So once it was done I used the philosophy one that I bought a few months prior.

So far I'm liking it, it goes on smoothly and doesn't feel sticky. * I love the sleek, black packaging. However, I do not understand all the good reviews.  I have extremely oily skin, and this ""dewy"" cream made my skin very dry and tight every time I used it. I very much prefer the dewy skin cream from Tatcha. * Im almost done with it and can say that im disappointed it was not hydrating. I put a good amount too to make sure and nothing. I really liked the toner so i wanted to try the day cream but i honestly didnt like it. For the price you could spend the same or spend a little more and get a better product * I've tried many many moisturizers over the years ranging from $45-$200 and this one is my absolute favorite! It'll be the one i get from hear on out. Im 49 and in my llayer year have experienced dry skin. Which looks like old skin . But this moisturizer is so good my skin looks younger! * I recently had almost a chapped texture to my skin I'm not really sure why but this cream is so hydrating it took care of all the issues I was having. A little goes such a long way. I have pretty sensitive/combination skin. * Received a GWP sample from Ulta.

Opened to use and it has blooms of mold spores!

Yikes.

The product was never opened and never used. Promptly went into the trash * I got this as a freevie and thank God it was a freebie. 0/10. If by dewy they mean greasy, then yes! I have normal-sometimes dry skin and I used it on a ""dryer"" day, it felt really gross and warm on my face. Very similar to vaseline. Thick and very difficult to wash hands after. Oil stains on my wash towel. I didn't have the red and blotchy allergic reactions like a lot of the other receiws, but this is glorified vaseline."

I had to wash it off after a minute * I absolutely love this skincare product. It has helped my skin greatly ! I've had many compliments since using this product! * Disappointed. I don't have a lot of extra money so something of this price is a splurge for me. I literally had to press the pump like 6 times to get any to come out. I thought it may have been because it's new. But the next 2 times I've had to press the pump like 10 times to get an Itty bitty amount to come out. Even shaking it, it feels empty. I don't live near a local store so I guess I'm just out that $$$. It does feel nice, the little bit I got out but can't get enough to use on my whole face. * This stuff is great if it's literally the only thing going on your face after cleansing, but otherwise it gums up and pills. For the price it's too finicky."

As soon as I opened the packaging, I was hit with the aggressive smell of this product and was transported back to my grandmother applying her heavily scented products in my youth. Since I had no other moisturizer with me, I used it and my combo acne prone skin informed me that I had offended it with the noxiously scented product. My skin was irritated and my husband, who has the worst sense of smell ever, could smell this product through a couple layers of product.

So needless to say, I do not recommend this product. * I had a bad experience with this cream. I have used this brand for many years because its products are made with high-quality ingredients, and it always tries to take care of the skin. But this cream, besides having a horrible and extremely strong smell, filled my face with pimples, made me look like a teenager, and dried out some areas of my face. It was a total disappointment. * loved the way it made my skin feel
but can't get past the strong fragrance * The texture of the cream is very light. I like how it applies smoothly on the skin. But it has a strong baby powder smell and it makes my skin look so greasy after a while. * Love this lightweight moisturizing gel cream. Also my husband always gives me compliments when he kisses my cheek because he loves the clean fresh scent of this cream. * I use several Avene products. I sometimes can't wait for this step in my skincare routine. I just love how good it feels going on.  It locks in moisture without feeling oily, too thick or too heavy. * This gel moisturizer seeps into the skin nicely, a little goes a long way. I have eczema, when it was super raw this did sting a little. The baby powder smell is OK, didn't bother me and I didn't love it either. This gentle yet effective for dry skin days. I love that it's non-comodogenic, for reference I have oily/dry combo skin that is acne prone."

I feel so much more confident as a 24 yo in my aging skin. Gentle and effective. Love avene products! Just the best * Let me start off saying I really DO like this! I have 36yo DRY skin and I was getting a little peeling and dry patches from my Rx Tret. once a week, but had zero irritation using this every night! It's a pretty thick cream consistency so not the easiest to spread on its own IMO. I like to use a serum before this Retrinal .5% to help it glide on the skin easier. One pump usually does it, but sometimes I add just a tiny bit more if I feel like I didn't get even coverage. It's definitely a long term product so don't expect immediate results. I DO wish Ulta carried the 1.0 version of this instead of just the .5%. * I just bought this product and I am loving it. I can't speak on results yet but as someone with oily/acne prone  skin, I feel like I finally found an anti-aging product that absorbs well and doesn't break me out. It may feel slightly ""heavy"" at first but it absorbs. Great for sensitive skin, as well! So happy I found this brand * I tried a couple of retinal creams, and had breakouts and/or burning. Having used many Avene products with great results, I took their skin quiz online, and this product was recommended. It is a great alternative to retinol, at a very low dosage so you can start to build use. I've had great success with it, and it is helping with fine lines around my eyes. I can use it every night with absolutely no irritation."

I ordered the moisturizer and it is not the same at all. My face started stinging and itching after the second use and it doesnt go on as smooth. * i loved this product for so long, but didnt realize that it what was breaking me out. i tried a different cleanser, added an exfoliater etc. NOTHING would get rid of the harsh bumps all over my face. not until i researched and found out it had safflower it in which (can) support fungal acne. i have dry, sensitive acneic skin so this may work for others but definitely not for me. very disappointed and wish i found out sooner. not even 3 days after stopping this product, my skin is clearing up. * I used to be a big fan of the Superscreen Daily Moisturizer, and although they kept the packaging the same, they changed the formula and the name to Superscreen Hydrating Daily Cream. I think brands should be more transparent about informing their customers that they're actually buying a different product than what they're used to. The consistency of the new cream is thicker and harder to spread, but what stands out the most to me is the smell: somewhere in between Play-Doh and generic baby sunscreen. My partner has sensitive skin around his eyes, and the old formula didn't cause him any burning, but the new one does. I wouldn't buy this again. * I bought this because it had avobenzone but no octocrylene (at the time). Great texture but I reacted badly to something in it. Guessing it was the algae because I've used the other ingredients before without issue. * DO NOT BUY new formula is horrible. Not the same product whatsoever. Why ruin a great product everyone loved?? Makes no sense. Ive gone through at least 10 of these moisturizers and now i will no longer purchase. And the new scent is a crime against humanity. * This used to be SOOOO awesome.  Now my face oily by 10 am and feels very irritated.  Also broke me out for the first time in a while.  Had zero issues with the old formula.  I really hope they change it back * What a great and rich sunscreen! The texture of this is super rich and hydrating while feeling so comfortable on my skin.

I was recommended by my esti to try another brand, but it was just too expensive to continue so I decided to go back to the Neutrogena. Sadly, the formula has been changed, and it is not at all what I experienced previously. I am not experiencing the redness and irritation that others are reporting, but my skin is not moisturized and looks dry and lifeless. My search for a new product begins. * Horrible. This new formula is simply horrible. It dries out my skin, makes it irritated, and leaves a weird greasy film. It pills like crazy and makes my skin horrible. I miss the old formula! It was perfect and always made my skin feel plump and soft. I swtiched to a higher end brand which is working now how this old neutrogena formula used to. Im incredibly disappointed in neutrogena and this product. * I used this product once and my skin immediately turned bright red and started burning/ felt hot. I washed my face immediately but the redness and irritation lingered. I came to the reviews to see if other people shared this problem and I was shocked to read so many people had the same reaction.

I also wonder if this product formulation is incorrect and needs to be recalled if this many people are reacting poorly. * I have sensitive and dry skin. The old formula was really soothing and hydrating. Now whenever I use it my face begins to burn and turn red. I do not think I have seen so much irritation in my face and neck ever. * I have worn the hydroboost creme (not water gel) for years. This new formula feels more oily than the old and I have to almost scoop it out and use more than the old formula. It doesn't have the same texture and smoothness. It just isn't the same. Also, much smaller container for same or more cost. So disappointed in this new formula. Really hope they will bring back the gel creme. * Love the texture and I was hoping it would be a suitable new nighttime moisturizer for me however my face breaks out when I use it. I will go back to what works for me (Cerave PM.)"

I LOVE IT!!! It blends GREAT (especially for a product with SPF), isn't greasy, doesn't make my skin oily or shiny, has not caused a breakout, and I can see a clear difference in the moisture level of my skin in just a few days. Anti-aging creams normally make my skin totally freak out, but this one is all good, no bad. Really glad I happened upon it! * This contains Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene....FYI * I joke that this is my old lady face cream because it smells like a bouquet of roses. However, it really does give the skin a lifted appearance and tightened feel. The daytime version has some SPF and wears nice under makeup. I wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin because of the fragrance. Also, I noticed on very dry winter days the product does not have enough moisture for my skin * I received this as a sample size from Estee Lauder and I can't wait to buy a full size. This is why I love samples, It lets me fiind out what I love without spending a fortune first.  It has the faintest fragrance that is subtle but lovely. It goes on so smooth and is just pleasant to use. My only complaint is the price. Some of us would buy this brand more often if we weren't priced out of the market. This is why I gave it a four. Otherwise, a five all the way. * This smells like febreeze and it doesn't go away when you rub it in :( save your monies * I use this product daily.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. It did not irritate my skin, which can sometimes be an issue for me.  Makeup base glides on smoothly over this moisturizer.  It is my absolute favorite. * I wish I could use this product as it seems to work well. However the fragrance is too strong and irritating."

For this price there must be something better out there! * I use this morning and night along with the face and eye serum (same brand) followed by sunscreen (only in the morning). I can truly say that this stuff along with the face and eye serum works. I used to have very dry skin, but not anymore. Also, the hormonal acne I get occasionally is under control. Lastly, the wrinkles are diminishing. Totally worth every penny. * I see smoother skin , brighter skin , less fine lines and an overall younger look * I do love this product, it's true to all things advertised - A little bit goes a long way as I purchased this a few months ago and still have more than half of it left. I did not want to write a review until I was certain I was satisfied based off of the huge expense... 

that said, I wish the product was a bit less expensive because I have tried other product lines that do the same job without the extra $$... but then again, you are paying for the name"

Love using it at night ! * Rich,  nourishing cream thats been an A+++ winner for my dry, acne prone skin and fine lines. * I know Cocokind is targeted to a younger audience, but after many useless purchases TRYING to find a night cream that will deeply moisturize, this 62 yo hit the jackpot.  This polypeptide cream is very rich and thick. There are a number of reviews complaining about the texture as being gluey and hard to spread.  I disagree -it is just very rich.  I would not use this as a day cream unless it is bitter cold out. This cream packs quite a moisturizing punch and relieves tightness.  It does NOT burn (THANKS!!) and just feels great on my face, neck, and eye area.  Do not hesitate to purchase if you need a wallop of good long lasting moisture-this is the best!!  10 stars if I could! * Super thick moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling super soft, plump and moisturized!

Great price point for the quality of the product. * as the infographic states ""a great winter moisterizer"" i agree. also a little goes A LONG way. i like how my skin feels after application. though the packaging says day or night i use at night bc it is very thick. i believe this is a great orice point for the quality of product. * This stuff is great.

I also use it on my neck and have noticed more of a difference there than on my face regarding tightening of skin. The cream is fairly light on the skin and is deeply hydrating. I ran out for a week and noticed an immediate difference! It can be a little shiny when combined with sunscreen and makeup however at night it just makes my skin glow. I am 48 and starting to battle some hormonal acne around my chin and mouth area so I have to avoid putting the cream around those areas. If I cant help myself (because it feels so good) I just get a few microscopic whiteheads that go away by the next day. * I love this cream. It feels so smooth. Going on. Has a beautiful texture. I noticed my skin is very vibrant after I use it. * This is so good! I went out on a whim and bought it and im glad i did. My skin really likes it, and even though my skin usually hates new products, its stayed clear with this! The smell is nice and spa-like and it's a pleasant experience using it. It's very hydrating too! Can't speak much for wrinkles but it makes my skin look healthier! * For the price point, I was disappointed in the moisture this product provided.

Have used it a couple years now.  Non-reactive on my sensitive skin and feels wonderful on.  I believe it has made a difference in the texture of my skin and improved my neck wrinkles. * Finding the right skin care routine is never linear since it varies person per person. I have sensitive combination skin and I always struggled to find a product that didnt give me that greasy glow. 

This product is light yet hydrating enough that it doesnt require a lot of product. While the price tad is high, the big container last me 2-3 months depending on the weather. 

I would recommend you get a sampler size and try it out for 3 months because you wont see any instant results.

I switched to e45 then another brand and I was fine. I then tried it again after a couple of weeks and it stung my face again! I usually don't have sensitive skin and I'm gutted I spent so much and now can't use it * Every single thing on my face 'balls up' when I use this moisturizer, including when I use it alone.  It does not absorb into my skin, but just sits on top. I've tried it in so many combinations and it's just incompatible with other skin care and foundations (I've tried several foundations -high end & low end- with same results).  I've also tried using it with serums, different primers, different sunscreens and alone with the same result. This is a hard pass for me. * In my early adulthood i had terrible acne and skin probs. I tried proactive and everything at the drugstore, nothing worked. I found Kiehl's and my skin turned right around and I've never had a problem since. Im willing to pay for good skin care, but this price still hurts. My skin would feel waxy and really greasy for a long time which aggravated my pores, which in turn aggravated me. It doesnt feel moisturizing at all. I feel like i just wasted a lot of money. Kiehl's let me down for the first time : ("

It's a thicker formula and left me with pilling * I have a light to medium skin tone and the white cast was quite visible until it's absorbed into my skin. however, if I was sweating or my face got wet, then the white cast would be visible again, which I hated since I sweat a lot at my job. * Leaves a white sheen no matter how much you rub it in * It says it's hypoallergenic but my face is full of hives every time I use it * This product has an awful white cast, and I am white. It makes me look so pale. I am so surprised given the price and the fact it is supposed to be a ""daily moisturizer."" Would not waste your money. * I loved the fact that it had hyaluronic acid and SPF in one, but after putting it on, I realize it's definitely not for me. I hoped the reviews were wrong, but it definitely leaves a white cast over your skin, and made me look super pale, despite the fact that I have a fair, medium skin tone. * I have tried almost every mineral sunscreen under the sun. I'm fair skin, freckles, burn easily, break out easily and this sunscreen moisturizer has been amazing. There is a white cast initially but I rub the product between my fingers before applying and it blends within 5 minutes! I never get sunburn on my face while wearing this. I also apply a ceramide barrier serum beforehand and do not experience any dryness while using this product. Would absolutely purchase a cool toned tinted version of this."
170,neutrogena,"hydro boost hyaluronic acid water gel moisturizer, fragrance free",pimprod2041883,2615397," * I like this product. Very good moisturizing for my skin. Doesn't cause break outs. It's a little sticky, but if you plan to put a product over it, it is not at all noticeable. Barely noticeable anyways, just worth mentioning. * This is such an amazing product!  I only make enough to buy the smaller size, but even that small size will last me almost a month, because it only takes a small amount to go over my whole face every night. * I have sensitive, combination, and acne prone skin. I have been using this moisturizer for the past 6 years and noticed a significate improvement in my skins overall health a few months into using this product. I love that it is fragrance free as well. * The original Neutrogena water gel mositruizer didn't work for me because of the fragrance. I'm very happy to see this mositurizer in a fragrance free version! This is a great moisturizer  for oily, sensitive skin. Its provides great hydration and is lightweight, non-irritating, non-comedogenic, and affordable. The new glass jar is a nice touch to make the product feel a bit more elevated. * I used the water gel for years, because it was the only affordable moisturizer I could find that didn't make me break out. I have combination skin. Now with the new formula, I am breaking out like crazy. I will not buy this again. Sadly, I have do go on another quest to find another moisturizer that works for my skin. * NO WAY. IT'S THE SMALL CONTAINER FOR $1 LESS THAN 1.7 OZ.
Don't buy this size at this price. Look around * V happy with this! I was super p.o about them changing the formula of the Hydroboost Extra Dry gel (now the Hydroboost water cream) I was using because it's the only thing that worked for me. That one has *horrid* reviews now about being too heavy and acne causing. This is perfect and I would consider it the same product as the old one I liked. Glad I went with this instead of the other one. I have dry, sensitive skin and this moisturized and kept me smooth with no breakouts."

Nothing compares. * I have combination skin. This did not break me out. I love how the texture changes once you start to rub it in. However, i wish it absorbed into the skin more completely. My skin feels tacky after using this, so my hair sticks to it. Oversll good tho! * This was recommended by a black dermatologist over a year ago.  I use it in combination with the vit C serum, any Vit C serum will work.  I absolutely LOVE the way this both looks and FEELS on my skin.  It works great with my various varieties of sunscreen, and I've never loved how great my skin looks so much. HIGHLY RECOMMEND * So far I love this product. Gives my face a fresh glow and moisture during this cold weather. I'm not sure if it would be great in the summer. The only issue is that you must dry your skin thoroughly. For some odd reason the texture of the cream changes if there's a hint of water on the skin. * I have very dry skin, and have tried and used over 50 face moisturizers, and this is one of the worst ones. It is SO thick and does not sink into the skin, it feels like its just sitting on top of your skin almost like sunscreen. I REALLY wanted to give it a fair try so I tried it as an overnight moisturizer, and when I woke up my skin did not feel moisturized. * I wanted to try this because it's made with clean ingredients, and ended up being disappointed by it. It left my face feeling oily in some places, and sticky all over. * I absolutely adore this moisturizer! I started using it a year or two ago and I've gone through multiple jars. It's lightweight and the texture is amazing. Starts off as a cream but then it disperses and feels like water on your skin. It leaves your skin so hydrated and dewy looking!"

At first it helped reducing the redness on my face and also helped me with the itching. However, after some days my rosacea went worse, so I dedided to stop using this product which actually made my rosacea to start going better.
I noticed that everytime I tried the product again, the roseacea would reactivate.

I know it has worked for others but my experience was not good. If you have sensitive skin, I dont recommend you this product. * Started working 15 mins after I applied it.  Next morning almost all of the redness gone.  Have a little more clearing up of the bumps but nothing works in a day.  Def recommend. * Pricey but effective- helped with my rosacea right away - I purchased a travel size cleanser   To try and my skin has cleared up less than a week . I have already been using the moisturizer which noticeably improved my dry skin * I used La Roche posay Vit C serum and followed it by this moisturizer. my face burned and the following afternoon, I had red patches on my patches and couldn't stretch of smile. it was painful * I got this to try to tone down my rosy cheeks and this cream absolutely made me redder AND added a burning sensation to my already sensitive skin. This does not moisturize and is more of a thick green paste that makes your make up look bad too. Yikes * This lotion is ok. I realized after buying and using that la roche posay is not a cruelty free line. Will never repurchase. * I've been using this product for about two weeks and noticed a difference with my redness but recently got a slight sunburn which it does not help for."

It is extremely over priced and delivers 0.0 of the results it claims to.  It does not plump, protect, or hydrate.  It also doesn't smell great tbh.  I'm convinced it's an artificial product with a fancy label.  Money making scam 100%! * I love the the way my skin looks and feels I can totally tell the difference. My skin is hydrated. * product smells awful!!! * Tried this moisturizer because i love the cleanser, but its the total opposite. Unlike the cleanser which is light, smells great and leaves skin feeling fresh, this moisturizer is thick, feels heavy on your face, and smells like artificial fruit. Also, the pump is terrible. * This moisturizer is absolutely amazing! My face is so soft and hydrated, I couldn't believe it. The smell is light and fruity. I'm so happy I gave it a try. * Though I do love the way this lotion feels on my skin, I won't purchase this again unless the packaging changes. It feels cheap and only works about 2/3 of the time. The scent of the lotion also takes some getting used to. * I like the feel on my skin. It has a lot of moisture in it and my skin looks good when using.  I get a lot of compliments regarding my skin"

Smells like plato but it did help with fine lines and felt moisturizing on my skin! My skins on the dryer side and this one would be good for normal-oily imo. The smell does go away after applying bjt it leaves a  great glow. Id get a lot of compliments going out not long after application * I love this so much its my favorite! makes my skin so soft. * This product brings moisture to my skin & helps decrease lines * I love Philosophy because the products really work! This is my first time trying this particular moisturizer and I love it! I have sensitive skin, & I try to find products that won't make my redness  worse. I just hit 40, and my once combo skin is getting drier, this moisturizer made a huge difference without making me break out. * Have been a Philosophy fan for years. This product, though it made my skin feel soft, has not shown any signs of working on wrinkles or even fine lines. * I love this product!! It gets rid of fine lines and hydrates sk well. * I started using Philosophy when Cristina first launched it & FELL in love. The Hope Moisturizer  made me break out but THIS line works beautuflly! I REALLY miss the jar of  Daily Retinoid pads w/ bottle of solution. PLEASE bring them back!!! MAGIC for my skin! SO many great products! I can choose what works best for me!

176,coola,refreshing water cream spf 50,pimprod2021554,2575597," * The sunscreen itself is wonderful, but I feel like they really did a great job on the packaging. For some reason it feels more sanitary to use than dipping your fingers in (even though I do wash my hands between applying products). 

Anyway, I can wear this sunscreen alone. Makes my skin glow so I feel comfortable skipping foundation 😌 * This is my first time working with an spf moisturizer, and honestly I think it does fine. I have oily + acne prone skin so moisturizers are a hit or miss, my only problem with this is that it does take a bit longer to absorb than I would like, but once it sinks in it's perfectly fine. * This is my first time trying these products. I was looking for a sunscreen that would not burn my sensitive skin or my eyes. 

I am 27 with combination skin. This product Is not greasy at all and it lasts all day. I also pair it with the mist for a retouch. * Has a cool and soft touch to the face. I also love the packaging. * This product made my face break out * I have very dry skin to the point it hurts sometimes, and I'm very particular about always wearing sunscreen on my face; I love this moisturizer/sunscreen! It really hydrates my skin, protects from the sun, and doesnt make me breakout either! I really enjoy the way it dispenses because it helps me to not use too much/too little of the product. * I have very dry skin and this stuff works its magic! Worth the price in my opinion. One jar lasted me a couple of months using it daily"

I apply it mostly at nights and make sure to apply spf in the morning. * I really enjoy the texture of this creme, and I love how it has left my skin both feeling and looking. I have hard water, and my skin has been really showing it lately. This has helped a lot. I've had no irritation, and found no noticeable scent which usually bother me. I highly recommend, feels worth the price to me where many others haven't. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. * I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I have dry skin and I am in my mid 30's. I used this for a few weeks morning and night, a long with my usual products. My skin was softer, fine lines less pronounced as well! The retinol had my dry skin glowing with cell turnover. I wore this under makeup with no issues (with and without primer). * I loves this product my skin feels flawless moisturizing and hydrating * I loved this sample it was the best had my skin feeling  hydrating and moisturizing * I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I enjoyed using this cream. It was a nice consistency, and I felt it absorbed well. I liked that it was fragrance free as well. This is a great alternative to other retinol creams. * I received this product for free. I've used it for couple months now and now it's part of my daily routine. The moisturizer feels super super smooth, absorbs quickly, and keeps my face hydrated."

Do be careful not to work it too much or it will turn orange. * I love thos product it evens my skin tone I just put powder on top and I dont need to put on liquid foundation. 
I will repurchase this product on my bect haul. * This product makes my face feel moisturized all day long and takes away the unwanted redness. I feel good without wearing makeup during the day with this on. it is a little dark for fair skin. if you mix it in with a little extra moisturizer it tones it down just enough!! definitely buying more ♥ * If you have fair skin, this is going to give a orange appearance wherever you apply. It also doesnt last very long even after setting it with powder * I'm a new skincare girly since I have a job for the first time in a few years. I did about a $40 binge of some noce stuff and then some while doing pickup. I have malar facial rash, and POTS. (NOT rosacea.) I have always been extremely insecure over it and embarrassed when people point out how red I am and ask if I feel okay.

When I tell you I put this on my cheeks, and it was literally like wearing a different face, omg guys I mean it. Nothing and I mean NOTHING compares to this. This will be a must have in my purse, and it didn't budge with a crying session either! 😩😩😩😍😍😍 * I loved this within the first few weeks of use, but over the past 2-3 months it hasn't been of use for me. Boring, but also doesn't work for those who have heavily visible acne, so on my bad days it was REALLY bad. * I have suffered on and off with perioral dermatitis since the nightmare days of the c—-d masks. I have tried almost every remedy over the counter, prescription, and people's own testimonial remedies. Finally this product has completely helped in disguising and healing this embarrassing facial rash. Bravo to Hero balm"
179,cosrx,full fit propolis light cream,pimprod2017573,2568303," * not sticky at all and doesnt pill when layered with other things. great at hydrating while still being light. * I have a very hard time finding moisturizers for my dry sensitive skin. This is dewy and hydrating without breaking me out. My skin is less red and smoother after using this. Love it! * I absolutely love this moisturizer! It's light & feels very hydrating. I love the dewy finish on my skin, but I wouldn't recommend for oily girls. This has Propolis at the very top of the ingredient list, so you know you're getting all the benefits for an affordable price. Not to mention it's fragrance free! I pair this with a peptide eye cream & it has diminished my fine lines * In lieu of my 5 star rating, this product sadly ended up in my ""can't use"" category. I absolutely loved EVERYTHING about the whole Propolis line, but unforturnately Propolis is an allergen tested during an allergy patch test and mine showed a trace reaction which my allergist informed me to avoid any allergens even if it is only a trace. This could be an issue for people who have sensitive skin. I have to say that other than being a possible irritant or allergy to some, this moisturizer is a really great consistency and lives up to all the expectations that it claims to have. As with any product that is new to your skin, proceed with caution and do a patch test. Its worth knowing :) * I love the toner and serum in this line but for whatever reason this lotion is just waaay too much for me. It would irritate my exzema and cause small/minor breakouts. I have dry/reactive/acne prone skin so moisturizers are a challenge for me * My skin loves it! My pores look smooth, its calming & hydrating without looking greasy. A little goes a long way. * I LOVE THIS! My skin took around a week to really settle into this as my face reacts to new things. However once i got into the routine of using this, my pores look smooth, my skin is plump, and is overall hydrating without looking greasy. It also calms down the redness I have on my cheeks. A little goes a long way. I finally found a moisturizer that works for me."
180,kopari beauty,moisture whipped ceramide cream,pimprod2034179,2597743," * This moisturizer is amazing! I wake up to the most glowing, softest skin ever! It's quite concentrated though, so a little goes a long way. There's no discernible smell. I definitely recommend. * The only reason i gave this product 2 stars is because of the representative who was promoting it, she was amazing!!

As far as this moisturizer (as well as the gold oil) are far from good. It does absolutely zero for my skin personally and my mom agrees as we each got a jar of it to try and at first was impressed…for me, ive tried it every way you can imagine and its not moisturizing at all-in fact my skin feels extremely tight and dry and  actually broke me out and no matter how much or how little i use it leaves a white-ish cast on my face. Ive researched the brand and honestly almost changed my entire skincare regimen to Kooari…thank god i didn't!!! 2/2 products both leaving me more than unimpressed-i think its just safe to say this line is not for me!! I wouldnt recommend it but if you do use Kopari and have good results-stick with it!!! Unfortunately, this is line is a hard no for me. I would never return either product just because it doesnt suit my personal skin needs which is no fault of anyones but its just rude to buy and try and expect the company where its sold or the maker of the product to take the loss. We need to be realistic and accept that when trying new skincare we take a chance… * I received a travel size of this amazing moisturizer in a 25 piece pink makeup bag GWP. 

Kopari doesn't disappoint! I'm very picky with moisturizers, and I 100% approve and recommend the Kopari Moisture Whipped Ceramide Cream. I just turned 47 in November and have gone from oily skin to combo/dry/slightly oily in the T-Zone. While I think this cream is best suited for normal - dry/combo skin, it may be a bit heavy for very oily skin.  I still think that oily skin types can use it as an overnight mask occasionally. 
I love that its fragrance free and all of the ingredients are skin-loving. Its a Big YES from me. 
I ended up purchasing the Kopari 'Dry Skin Savior's ' kit, ($49), which includes a full size of the Moisture Whipped Ceramide Cream, Marine Clean Purifying Gel Cleanser (travel size), & Niacinamide and Caffeine Eye Bright Cream (full size). Kopari is an amazing brand! I wish Ulta would bring back some of their other products. * My skin has gotten dryer over time (51 yrs) and this moisturizer has filled the gap in my skincare routine. This cream is just as good as products that are twice the price and it wears well under my make up. My skin has never looked better. I use First aid beauty facewash cream then a serum or two like hylauronic acid or niacinimide then this cream. I add an exfoliating pad in a few times a week from Elemis or I'll use an exfoliating toner. my skin is sensitive so I can't exfoliate daily. I often use Fresh Rose toner too after I wash my face but before serums as well.  I don't need any foundation or skin tint. My skin looks amazing. * I absolutely love the Kopari Moisture Whipped Ceramide Cream! The texture is light and fluffy, yet it delivers intense hydration that lasts all day. My skin feels softer and smoother, and it's perfect for my drier skin without feeling greasy. It's also gentle enough for sensitive skin, leaving a healthy, nourished glow. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a moisturizing cream that really works! * The cream is very good and up to now is working good, I need to keep trying the cream for a linger time. * I have tried endless products that either feel like they sit on top of the skin or completely disappear in a second yet my skin still feels like dry. This is hands down the best moisturizer I have used for my extremely dry skin type. I use it every night and I can tell a huge difference."

It keeps my skin so hydrated under foundation!! * This is perfect to moisturize the skin before applying makeup. Leaves your skin glowing and hydrated before foundation * This is the key to flawless makeup! I've used countless moisturizers and primers, and have never been quite happy with how my makeup blended on top. I wish I would have tried this sooner, but it was worth the wait. I have combo skin, and this is so smooth and hydrating, but not heavy or greasy. The smoothness is what makes me love how my foundation blends on top. I like a matte finish foundation, but they tend to be too drying and look dry on my skin. Not anymore! I get the smoothest, most plush looking effect from this moisturizer and my makeup looks better than ever! I highly recommend this! * True to explain, stays on, I see the difference in my skin. * I have noticed a HUGE difference in fine lines! Im 29 and constantly asked if im 22! * Used this product for 4 days, my entire face and neck broke out in a rash. I do not recommend this product to anyone that has sensitive skin. * Im so disappointed!! I wanted so badly to love this and the serum but it just sits on my face and it pills really really bad! Ugh. Hard pass."
182,origins,ginzing energizing gel cream with caffeine + niacinamide,pimprod2033869,2598935," * Probably one of the beat skincare products I've ever used. Wish I could afford to keep it in stock. * This eye gel is part of my every day beauty routine. A little goes a long way. It's very soothing and moisturizing. It does not settle in pores and it does not pill. I use it before I put on my tinted moisturizer. * Refreshing light citrus scent, cool on the skin, moisturizes without feeling heavy or greasy. * I was looking for cheaper dupe to the 100hr moisture surge from clinique and this was the only other moisturizer that has caffine in it. But the smell was too strong. Says theres essential oil inside but i never break out but i did. Go pay the extra 10 or get moisturizer surge. Also blackfriday and other holidays it goes on sale * I received a sample of this product in a big sample kit and decided to try it out. I had been using The Ordinary Niacinamide + Zinc for the longest time and after trying out the sample there is no going back for me. I had no idea but The Ordinary was causing breakouts which cleared up in a matter of days once switching to this. It makes my skin feel refreshed almost immediately and my skin looks brighter and plumper after just 30 minutes. Normally heavily fragrant products make me break out and cause my face to burn due to my sensitive skin but I have not had this issue at all with this product. It is a refreshing citrus smell which I absolutely LOVE the smell of citrus. After long time use my skin consistently looked brighter and I had less dry skin and fine lines. It is true that it does leave your skin feeling sticky but I always put my moisturizer on top of it and the stickiness is no longer an issue. I highly recommend this product!! * This moisturizer has really leveled up the radiance of my face. I use this as my night cream, and ive been waking up to increasibgly refreshed and energetic skin with each passing day. * My skin has never felt so soft. I also use the scrub so the combination is making my skin look younger and softer!"
183,peach & lily,rescue party barrier comfort cream,pimprod2042702,2617478," * If you havent tried this physically, I reccommend you do. The feeling on the skin is incredibly rich and balm-like. I have oily skin and only use this at night after all my skincare as a slugging method. I really dont think this is a daily moisturizer for many people, but definitely heals the skin. Its similar to if Aquaphor was going to absorb into your skin. I've never really tried anything like this, and am pleased to add it to my nightime skincare routine. Do not expext this to be a whipped or creamy texture, its more heavy upon application but absorbs. Leave the skin feeling smooth and pillowy. Great product. * Smelled odd. * This is a great barrier cream and has lasted me a decently long time! * I was so disappointed by this product. I normally love Peach & Lily and use their products almost exclusively, but this one was a fail for me. It smelled bad immediately upon opening - kind of like rancid almond oil. It also caused acne on my otherwise clear skin. It's not breathable, which I think is kind of the point, but I didn't like the way my skin felt after putting it on. * The bottle i got smells bad like old products and i am not sure if it is expired. * I love this moisturizer, I use it at night with the matching serum to help calm my skin from redness and irritation which really helps after a long day. It just adds so much moisture to my skin and helps with flakeyness. I like the smell and it's a nice texture not really lightweight it's a bit thicker than that so it can help with moisture since it's a thicker moisturizer. I would definitely recommend this product, im already using a lot of Peach&Lily products. It's my skincare brand, I love the brand and their products. * Was persuaded to buy this brand because of it being vegan and good for ""all types of eczema."" I did try it on my hand first and was fine. However, it caused a severe reaction on my face. As you can see, it is not safe for all type of eczema."

For referance i used to use the neutrogena hydroboost moisturizer haha this stuff is 10x better. Although it is a bit pricey I think its totally worth it. My skin glows like no other! I dont wear makeup so its important for my skin to be on 10 at all times. I also have combo skin and it doesnt make me feel oily or anything. Lastly, I bought the bottle at the beginning of April and its now Sept and ill probably buy another by the end of this month.. so the money goes a long way!! * I enjoyed using the product, the packaging is really good. It has a really nice smell without being strong. The only thing I don't like is that it's a bit pricey for the quantity. * They changed the formula and the smell is completely different. I used to love this product because it smelled like a spa. The new formula also does not feel as rich on the skin. This will be my last bottle. Too pricey and it is near impossible to get the last 1/4 of the product out of the jar, * I purchased this cream and overnight cream for my face along with the body lotion ..WELL
They all smell the same overnight and Day facial cream is the same to me 
I spent over $100.00 on two facial products are the same .
won't buy it again * Lightweight, smells great and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. * Ok seriously Ive tried thousands of products over the yeara because i have sensitive ans acne prone skin! Ive been using this every day sometimes twice a day if i rememebr and its kept my skin CLEAR!! Even with the return of rhe mask mandate at work its protected my skin from my ""maskne"" ive had theoughout the pandemic. Would definetlt recomend this.

I love the light scent as well. 10 out of 10! * Lighter than extra firming but felt sticky when used after toning. Heavy fragrance not good for sensitive skin flared my rosacea. Did make my dry skin soft but returning this one, * I love the fragrance.  I did t find it overwhelming.  I also like how quickly absorbs into the skin and doesn't have yhat greasy feel after on the tace.  I typically layer this with serums.  I tried it in the colder dry months and makes my skin feel  hydrated. * I had been use this product over 20 years 
It worked very good on my skin. * This is marketed for normal-dry skin but I have combo-oily and my skin drinks this! Also not marketed for my age range (20s), but if you're looking to splurge, this is it! I bought it on a whim as a Beauty Steal and I would absolutely buy it again. It's super hydrating but lightweight, not greasy, great for sensitive skin, and leaves me with a healthy glow! This moisturizer has helped to smooth my skin especially as I'm dealing with breakouts - gives me better glass skin than some Asian beauty products that claim to do so. Love love love! * A light moisturizer that delivers maximum hydration.  I have always had good results from Clarins products."
186,peter thomas roth,firmx collagen moisturizer,pimprod2014564,2561084," * Im really surprised by the negative reviews. I got a sample of this cream ans love how my skin feels ans looks when i use it. The price is exorbitant and is the only thing keeping me from making it my usual night cream (i work in retail so it takea half a shift to pay for it). I'll jusy have to watch for sales! * I bought the collagen cream to replace collagen masks. I am very pleased with the results after just a few days. After cleansing and toning, I massage a small amount into my skin. I allow it to dry completly and then use Philosohy Miracle Worker face cream over top of it. This gives me smooth, glass skin all day. My skin texture has markedly improved since adding the collagen cream. It is key to properly massage the collagen cream in and letting it dry before adding the second cream. I do not wear makeup, so I cannot speak to how it would layer. * I was really excited to try this and after a few weeks notice no results. * Leaves my skin soft. Will repurchase * I blend this with the  prayer Thomas water drench sheet tint moisturizer. Blends great! Firms my skin and doesn't feel greasy or heavy.  I use this as a foundation.  Quite  expensive for the combo… but it works great with make up or just as a tinted moisturizer with mascara. * This is a great product and feels good on my skin, but I can't use it like other moisture products before applying my foundation because of pilling.. I now use only at night so I'm not putting anything over it. * I like it. I also drink collagen supplements so i think it works pretty well on top if it. Im only 23 so i dont have wrinkles to begin with but i will say that its pretty sticky going on and if you touch your face while its trying to dry than you will get the 'beads' like everyone else is saying but if you dont touch your face until its fully dry it will look normal"

Wish they'd reformulate it so I could go back to using it again. * I personally wasn't a fan of this product. First I want to point out the sales associates at Ulta are super sexist to men and I got passed multiple times every time I asked for help literally ignored me. But back to this product, it's very similar to sun screen I prefer a thicker face lotion like the 2-1 face & beard but that got discontinued. * After years of using Vasaline Intensive Care lotion on his face, I convinced him to try the Clinique For Men Broad Spectrum SPF21 Moisturizer.  He loved it!  For a lotion with sun scree, it's not greasy and  it absorbs into the skin nicely leaving no residue. * If you've ever had a reaction to a sunscreen this one probably contains your culprit. Wore once and broke out in a rash/hives where it was applied. I will now be avoiding oxybenzone. * Applied it at the store to test it out and also bought some, a few hours later had a giant bump on my chin. Going to rerun it tomorrow. * This is the only product my husband doesn't seem to have a skin reaction to. He has oily, sensitive skin. * My husband, who usually hates skin care products, is obsessed with this Clinique moisturizer. I paired this one with the anti-age moisturizer in the Clinique line and he's noticed a huge difference in his skin tone."

I started using this less than a week ago in the throes of an eczema flare-up and when I tell you my eczema is literally all gone omg. my skin barrier is starting to heal, and my post-inflammatory discoloration is fading as well. this lowkey worked better than my prescription hydrocortisone? while this is a tad pricey (at least for me), a little goes a long way esp when applying to damp skin! I also personally like to put a little vaseline on top to really lock in that moisture because I have super super dry skin. * This was my first purchase of anything from this brand and my mind is blown at how amazing it it! I have never tried another lotion that is as moisturizing as this one. I started using it on my face after a micro needle procedure and loved how it felt. Worked so well, not too greasy, and no unpleasant scent. I am now using it on my entire body and wish I could buy it by the gallon! * I bought this because I read that its good for face & body. My face tends to get dryer in the winter and this has been great so far. I like that I can use it all over on my daughter who is sensitive and has eczema. I will probably repurchase this each winter season. Great product. * I've used multiple lotions and face creams for my face but none of them seemed to do my face justice. I have psoriasis  breka outs on my face and body so i have to use steroid creams on those areas making my skin sensitive and dry and irritated. This lotion not only soothes my irritated skin, but its extremely mosturizing !! When i say its a good moisturizer… it does not make me oily and even in my t-zone areaswhere i tend to be oily . I will say a little foes a long way on the face just be conscious of how much you use . As far as I only been using this fall and winter it it keeps me moisturized all over my husband says my skin is nice and soft  ! * If you have reallt dry skin PLEASE try this out, keeps my skin soft all day and doesnt clog my pores. Barely any acne with this product. * My skin has been extremely dry all winter and nothing was helping… until i tried this. This is my new holy grail. * I've been using it continuously since its gotten colder. I have really bad eczema flare ups during exam season and this has really helped with keeping my skin moistured. My only problem with it is that it smells like glue."

I will always recommend using this product * I'm not sure why this happened if my skin is really good with salicylic acid in fact it prefers it then benzyl peroxide so I decided to try this out. I put it on overnight after my moisturizer as much as my pointer finger and I woke up the next day, my breakouts worse so I just stopped using it right then and there kind of disappointed was hoping for good results.🥺 * I love how it feels on my skin and i think it would add hydration to my skin. * My daughter tried the face wash and this gel and her face had a terrible reaction. No, no new foods or other items. She immediately began burning. Her face is like this on both sides and she has never had sensitive reaction to any other product. * I have dry, but clear skin. However, summertime + makeup = sweaty breakouts. So to stay on top of it, I started using this product once daily during my nighttime routine. Started working in just a few days of use. Now, instead of having several problem areas after a full day of wearing a full face of  makeup and sweating, I maybe have just small baby blemish that resolves itself overnight. It also does not dry out my skin more than it already is, if anything my skin has been feeling softer and more hydrated. I use La Roche Posay double repair moisturizer and it works well alongside it. With how well this has worked for me, I'm excited to try more products from them. Highly recommend! * i love this brand so much i've literally never been disappointed with any of their stuff but my makeup grips onto this like the hydro grip primer i am in love!! I've always had issues with layering and pilling no matter what i changed before but this product is crazy good and makes it easy, here to repurchase AGAIN. please good molecules never stop making this product and just try it especially if u have oily or combo skin"

195,peach slices,redness relief calming cream,pimprod2033305,2597521," * I have sensitive skin and I struggle with eczema flair ups around my face and eyes. I bought this during one of my worst flair ups. This, with the matching cleanser, single handedly balanced my skin back to normal. This is a very nourishing, light weight moisturizer that feels so calming and soothing on my skin and helps reduce my redness. I will say I get the best results if I double moisturize with this product. I have tried switching up my skincare since I first started this product and everytime I get a flair up. Once I start using this moisturizer and the cleanser again, my skin resets back to normal. This also layers nicely under makeup and is nonburning on eczema patches. I love this product and cant recommend it more. * I have oily, acne prone skin. So I deal with a lot of redness when I do break out. This cream is great to soothe that redness. I put on very little in the morning, but I put on a little bit more for overnight. This goes on after I wash, use Hero Post Blemish Rescue Balm, Tallow & Honey Moisturizer, and before I spritz on some ITK Blemish Treatment Mist. Definitely works for my routine! * Great moisturizer! Its lightweight but can feel greasy if you put too much so start with a little and add nore to your face if needed. I couldnt tell if this product helped the redness much but it did feel very calming and hydrating on my skin. Not sure if its quite worth the price to me since my redness didnt really improve but I enjoyed my first purchase and am thinking about buying again. * It's moisturizing, calming, and feels nice, but unfortunately this product just doesn't help out with redness. Disappointed. * My skin felt angrier after applying. Tried a few times. Returning. * My skin is very sensitive- i have mild rosacea and can be prone to breakouts. This didnt make my skin burn or break me out, but it didnt improve my redness at all. It's a nice basic moisturizer and i appreciate that its not heavy, but it doesn't actually reduce redness. It can be hard finding things that dont actively irritate my skin though, so if you need a good basic moisturizer for sensitive skin this is a good choice just don't expect to drastically reduce redness. * I use the Peach & Lily Matcha Moisturizer for redness but it's expensive so I thought I'd try this one. It is very heavy on my skin and made me feel greasy. I didn't notice an immediate change like I did with Peach & Lily's. I might just suck it up and pay extra."
196,vanicream,facial moisturizer broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2042402,2619672," * The formula is so dense it feels heavy on the skin. I know it's a mineral sunscreen but it leaves such a noticeable white cast. Don't even think about putting other products under because every single one I've tried has pilled off when I go to rub it in * I have very sensitive skin, vanicream is the only brand I have found that doesn't cause a breakout or dry out my  very dry skin. the only con I have for this SPF is it is really oily the first 30ish minutes after applying, even on my very dry skin. I would purchase again though due to being the only product that hasn't caused a breakout or dried out my skin. I love that it is 100% mineral sunscreen as I am allergic to chemical ones. * it was very oily on my skin, left a white cast, and when i put makeup on top of it it made it very patchy * I wanted to love for the spf + moisturizer but it left my skin feeling sticky. I have dry skin. It felt like my skin wasn't absorbing it. It felt like no mather how mucb you rub it in it wont absorb. It also has a white cast, I usually never minded it but with this one I did. * My dermatologist gave me a sample of this and I fell in love with it. It makes my skin so soft. I was excited when I found that Ulta carries it! * It can be a better product. Brand claims to be for sensitive skin but this product needs a new formula. Eyelids need sunscreen too so I put on a small amount (smaller than a dime) and after about 10 mins my eyes get watery. White cast for me is manageable but for how this brand perceives to be great but not really * I bought this product because the regular version of Vanicream was out of stock.  One week later I'm itchy and my skin is peeling like a lizard.  DO NOT purchase this if you actually have sensitive skin."
197,lancÃ´me,hydra zen glow lightweight liquid moisturizer with hyaluronic acid,pimprod2016440,2562193," * It feels great in my face * Too sticky and didn't get any benefit from this one. * A beautiful moisturizer for the Summer.  I have very dry and mature skin and generally need a very thick moisturizer so, thus one surprised me!  It's super light, absorbs very quickly and keeps my skin moisturized all night. * One of the best moisturizers ive used and ive used quite a few. I honestly it better then even the more expensive, better reviewed competitors (like Tatcha or Glow Recipe). The smell is strong but it works really well and makes my skin glow and feel good. * lightweight, not too glowy , easy to layer with sunscreens * I was advised to try this instead of more makeup to cover red areas on my skin. It worked immediately and just zapped my dry skin issues. My friend, who has suffered from Excema for years saw her redness and itchy skin gone within days. * Came back to do a review update because I'm on bottle 3 of this gem right now and I figured most reviews are done after a couple uses or a week of use. I like to read reviews after extensive use of a product. Okay so after bottle #2 I decided to branch out and try something new (I know we all do it!) so after almost 3 mths of using something else my face lacked it's glow and some of my hyperpigmentation returned around my cheeks and upper lip. I had managed to clear almost all of it up while using this! Stupidly I fell for a video of a different product and switched to it. I just went out and bought this again and already my face feels softer again and I know my hyperpigmentation will decrease again! I won't make that mistake again! This formula does not contain dimethicone which is important to me, I don't want a fake softness to my skin, I want a nourished softness. This is light and silky going on and even with dehydrated, dry skin I can skip a top moisturizer most days. The light smell goes away within seconds and does not bother me at all - strong botanical smells cause a migraine- lucky me! This is not a gel it is more like a serum texture or a light lotion texture, it sinks in pretty quickly. The bottle is glass and beautiful on my countertop, plus pump bottles are way more sanitary than droppers or jars. I appreciate a good pump bottle because I know when something comes with a spatula I'm using my fingers after about a week and a dropper always ends up touching my face or not sucking up enough product so I get mad at it! Come on beauty industry there is nothing wrong with a pump dispenser! Take note!!! I highly recommend this product and pray Lancome doesn't ever discontinue it! 
So if you have uneven tone, hyperpigmentation, dry and or dehydrated skin, aging skin, and dislike dimethicone you may love this formula!"

If you have really sensitive skin this might be it.. but Before they changed the packaging i swear the product was better, it made my skin looker younger, hydrated, and would clear my skin. * I moved here from Texas and this moisturizer is the only cream I use in this cold weather. * This is a great moisturizer but unfortunately there's no change in wrinkles * I used to love Clinique and this moisturizer was great, but they changed something and it now gives me acne. * I've been using this for the past few months and my skin has never been better-  Great cream that  moisturizes without being greasy, absorbs fully into skin .  i have very dry skin and it works wonders ! * I love this moisturizer for aging skin. It  makes skin brighter, soft, and silky. My fine lines at my mouth already look better. I had been using a retinoid based cream but it was burning my skin, not this stuff though. It's a bit pricey but I highly recommend it! * I've used Clinique all my life, at 76 I never thought it would reck my skin like it did! Red patches all over my face!"
199,peach slices,redness relief color correcting moisturizer,pimprod2037238,2605747," * The directions instruct you to shake the product, and after doing so, a clear liquid came out that smelled like rubbing alcohol. I gave it a second try and thick textured beige cream came out that irritated my skin. * I mean, yes, it covered up my redness. It matched my skin tone. I just can't get past the fact it made my face extremely oily!!! I will not repurchase! Off to find yet another redness relief product. Sigh. * I personally love this.  I can see why a lot of people would not though.  You have to shake it well because yes it separates, but totally fixable.  It starts off green then turns a light shade once you apply it.  I love the tone, and wear it as my foundation and it gives me a light dewy coverage.  It is thicker, but it works for me.  I wouldnt reccomend for fair or deep skin tones.  Light-medium would work best. * I was hoping this would help even out my rosacea a little bit. Unfortunately the tint is darker than my very fair skin and it also made my skin look grey. * Liquid came pouring out the bottle when I opened it. Tried shaking it and waiting, but the product was completely separated. Looked and smelt expired or something. It didn't blend at all. Also super orange. * This product does what it claims to do. It provides color correction for my rosacea-prone skin without causing dryness like most color correctors do. This product wears well alone or under makeup. I will forever repurchase this product. * I love this stuff. Feels a bit like a bb cream. Very moisturizing. Doesnt pill, but will separate a bit after about 8-10 hours. I apply with a blending brush and I started using tower28 pressed powder on t zone and it helps so much. Feels light on my skin. will continue to repurchase. Great for everyday look"

I have really oily skin & thought the gel texture would be great for me. -I DO like that, but after using this every morning for a week my skin started to break out a little. I kept using for another week to see if my skin was just purging. I'm still have the breakouts. I normally don't have that happen with other facial moisturizers I've used. I don't have sensitive skin. Sad, but I am returning this product and going back to my regular moisturizer. * I don't have sensitive skin. I use Vitamin C on my skin on a regular basis & layer several serums under moisturizers. This product instantly burned my skin which was something I had never experienced. Tried again this morning & had to wash it off. * It's great. * Sadly was not for me, burning sensation instsntly. Needed to wssh my face and back to my normal hydrating serums and moisturizers. 
Item was returned * This product (I didn't use anything else in my skincare routine) made my skin super irritated, inflamed, red, sensitive, covered in bumps, and itchy, like I've never seen before. My eyelids are also very swollen & it's hard to see. It's been a few days and my face still looks scary and burns every time I wash it and try to put any fragrance free lotion on. Not sure what ingredient in this product I am allergic to. I have used many (stronger) vitamin C products over the years and had never had any issues. I do enjoy other products from this brand though. * I would give this zero stars if i could. It burned my skin so badly I immediately had to wash it off. * i wanted to love this product, i love the FAB cleaners but this moisturizer burns my face. it may be a little bit too strong for my face, even though it says for sensitive skin."

But it seems to work its way into my eyes, and it stings for a long time. I don't think I will buy it again, but it is good enough. * Thats all jusy buy it! * purchased this due to the spf rating. I use Olay sensitive during the winter months and usually add Neutrogena SPF, but I found this product this spring and decided to try it. I absolutely love. I use serum first and then this. I absorbs nicely and doesn't leave my skin sticky. I use under my eyes and my eye lids and I do not experience any burning. I occasionally use powder foundation and it holds all day. the scent is nice and not over powering like other products. * Wanted to love this product however it burns my eyes!! * Great product. * I can only put this on about half of my face because of how incredibly badly it makes my eyes sting. Even if I take care to avoid the eye area, it creeps in them somehow. Feels nice as a moisturizer but it makes me look more sweaty/oil slick than glowy. Have to completely cover my face with setting powder for my skin to not look wet. * this product provided a good moisturizer for my skin but it left my skin oily. I used it with a hydrating serum after but I also used the moisturizer by itself and it still made my skin oily. It made my face smell like sunscreen but it helped with an initial layer of sun protection. If it wasn't so oily I would like this product."
202,charlotte tilbury,travel size magic cream moisturizer with hyaluronic acid,pimprod2043572,2619312," * This product is not magic. It's an OK moisturizer. Doesn't really have any pleasant or offensive smell. May have made my face slightly softer, I didn't notice any improvement and wrinkles. My main issue is the cost and also the travel sized container would require you to bring Q-tips or an applicator with you. You can't fit even a finger into the tiny opening to get the product out. Will use what I have, but wouldn't buy again. * I wouldn't buy again- it was super annoying because of the pilling. * I was looking forward to try this product. The sales associate said product was great!! Well, 2 jars down and still waiting for something. I'm very savvy about my facial products, but this didn't show anything. This is just my opinion for myself. Hopefully someone else will have better results. * Goes on smooth and keeps skin plump and moisturized. * The charlotte's magic cream is amazing product.  Your face will look and feel younger smoother and with less wrinkle's. Also, using this product your foundation will go on so much smoother looking. I would highly recommend using and you will love it. * It makes my skin look and feel silky smooth. * I had seen someone use this cream on a make up tutorial to help with creasing with make up. I bought the sample size and have been using it every day for a month now and I had to buy a second one because it worked so well for moisturizing my skin for context I am in my late 30s and I have combinational skin, I do not get any breakouts from using this and it really offers a great boost and moisture.

I trusted them as an early brand for clean beauty, when that category was much (much) smaller. While this product smelled amazing, and soaked in great...I started breaking out. I couldn't figure it out for a week!

Not only are octyl salicylate and octocrylene not reef safe, but they also break me out terribly with what feels more like a burn. Stay away, if not for yourself - for the environment. * I was very excited to find a daily moisturizer with the bonus of having sun protection. However, I don't want to smell like I'm going to the beach at work (or anywhere else for that matter). It's kinda heavy and makes your eyes water from burning. * I absolutely love this moisturizer!! It is a bit greasy but if u have dry skin this is my go to. I love the subtle smell too! I would recommend this. Just don't get it near your eyes if possible. It will burn ur eyes * it's a bit greasy even after soaking into my normal skin, and has been causing me to break out. It smells amazing and feels nice, but I really miss the Sea &C magnifying primer that was discontinued. The finish was better and didn't make me break out at all. * I don't know why I thought that maybe this time regular American chemical sunscreen actives wouldn't burn the crap out of my face. This product irritated my skin really bad. I bought the whole line and had such bad breakouts and dry skin that it took at least two months to regain even a semblance of normal skin and I only used the line for at best two weeks (but the sunscreen was only once on the face). I was using this on my chest as sunscreen until I started breaking out there too. I have had a bad reaction to nearly all of Pacifica's products and I think I'm done even trying. * The moisturizer works great and smells amazing. However, it's not the best for oily skin. I have combination oil skin and my skin gets very, very oily with this after a few hours. I gave it 4 stars just for that reason. If you have normal or dry skin, I think this would work better."

I prefer this version, and layer my spf50 over this. Also love that its refillable. * Leaves my face feeling hydrated and plumped and smooth * I rarely get irritated skin from a skincare product, but this cream irritated my face so badly. After applying in the morning, by nighttime, my skin was red, itchy, and breaking out. Over the next few days. my face was super dry and peeling. Not sure which ingredient was the cause but this cream was disappointing, had to return. * This product make my skin soft and smooth, only little bit is enough for the skin * Really love how this isnt greasy or sticky. The scent is nice. My makeup looked so good over it w a primer, but I'd prefer it had a sunBLOCK. SPF 40, at least. I feel naked w/out more sun protection. Otherwise, loved it. * Very moisturizing for this 56 yr old face. Sinks in beautifully and is perfect under makeup. Feels very luxurious.  I will continue to buy. Highly recommend. * I think for the price its not really worth it. Although it is very moisturizing, it did not last till the morning. There are so many other creams you can get for a cheaper price that are just as moisturzing or more. Id give this a 3.8"

But, this lotion is sensitive enough not to irritate my skin furthermore and durable enough to lock in moisture to eliminate dryness without clogging up my pores. Happy i came across this brand because I have wasted a lot of money before finding this product. * Please never remove this. It's the only moisturizer I've ever been able to use without triggering my acne!! I never have any product related breakouts anymore!! Finding a good moisturizer that worked for my skin was soo hard. This is so perfect and I've been using it for probably a year now. * I use retinol and aha products regularly so every now and then my skin peels and gets red and sensitive. I have tried a lot of soothing and calming products on the market to fix my occasionally irritated skin but so far this one is the only one that doesn't hurt when applied and that actually calms my skin down. I have used both its cream and balm version. They are both great but I like the balm one a little better. * Glides onto the skin nicely and leaves a nice hydrated finish to the skin. Very soothing for dryness without clogging pores * In recent years i've developed excema on my eyelids, chin & ear lobes. I've tried so many moisturizers that claim to help reduce redness and lock in moisture, but it wasn't until I found this product that my skin changed for the better. I bought the 3 pack sample with the facewash and thermal water and fell in love with all. 

First purchased back in September 2022 & still using the same 3 products today. I even tried to change back to some old products that used to work for me and my skin returned to the brittle and scaly old self that used to be. I remain consistent with this brand, and they have shown me love back, my skin soaks this stuff in and doesnt break me out whatsoever. 

Super gentle and refreshing. One of my favorite pros is that it leaves my irritated and stinging skin, smooth and calm. if you have irritated skin that stings, even when you put your moisturizer on it, this product is definitely for you and will help with that sensation. * This is my favorite Avene product! So much that I finished my first tube and bought two more! It has been very helpful for my dry face this winter and I love using it at night over my serums. * Helped razor burn and is super gentle"

I can't recommend enough, will be repurchasing! I bought when it was on thanksgiving sale! * PUR's Get A Lift moisturizer has become a staple in my beauty routine! I've been using it for a year and have purchased it three times now. I've only ever bought it when it's on sale, but I honestly think even at full price it would be worth it! I'm 34 with combo skin, leaning more towards oily. My skin is also flaking and peeling right now due to my prescription skincare treatment and the cold weather. This moisturizer does an excellent job keeping my skin hydrated without pilling or weighing it down, and it keeps the peeling down to a minimum, if any! Once it's absorbed, my skin looks nice and dewy instead of greasy, and I've seen improvement in both softness and texture of my skin. It does burn occasionally if I have patches that are particularly red/irritated, but the burning stops quickly and there's no irritation afterwards. The scent is light, sort of citrusy, and it doesn't linger. I use it every evening and one jar lasts me about 4-5 months. Overall I highly recommend this moisturizer! * This facial cream feels great on my skin. I use it daily to help with loss of elasticity and firmness, especially around the jawline. I really do think it's helped my 60+  yr. old skin. * This moisturizer feels amazing on my skin and so luxurious. I would buy again! * I bought this during black Friday sales and biggest regret was not buying more while on discount.

The formula feels amazing in my skin, it literally feels so luxe. And there is noticeable difference to my skin. I'm actually obsessed! * I have sensitive skin and unfortunately lots of water retention in my face due TO PCOS (moon face) I've really started to notice a difference with this product. Especially on a good night's sleep. But I love applying it before makeup. It makes my makeup so smooth looking and skin stays so soft."

The primer itself feels nice ans hydating but would not recommend putting makeup on top. * I use this product every day with or without makeup, it feels so nice on my skin and keeps it hydrated and gives it a nice glow. * Had such high hopes due to multiple influencers recommending this product. Didn't notice much difference in the appearance of my combo, dehydrated skin. Worst of all id the fact that this product PILLS and doesn't play nice with much of any other skincare products nor makeup. Really wanted this to work! * I used this religiously from the ages of 15-17 and it was my favorite makeup product. I reordered it on sale last week at the age of 25 and it is still so amazing, but not hydrating enough for me anymore. I love the smell, its super light but lingers in the best way. I will still use it and probably reorder but will be prepping with a heavier moisturizer before applying this under makeup. I also really love it for a no makeup makeup day because it just seems to make my skin even and glowy. * I just turned 44 and am feeling it. I purchased a bag of new products including this moisturizer on the recommendation of 2 employees. I wore it for the first time on Thursday with mascara and eyeshadow. A female coworker told me, ""I hope that this doesn't get me into trouble, but your face looks so good. You have the natural glow of someone that just had a good time."" So needless to say I will wear this every day for the rest of my life. * My skin isn't the most sensitive, but it does have random triggers that cause redness and irritation. My face broke out in red irritated blotches, especially near my eyebrows. Love FAB, but this one ain't for me :( * I got this in a Boxycharm and I was SOOO excited as I LOVE things coconut-y! I tried it multiple times, with my favorite products and new products I never tried, and my skin looked oily and the makeup never seemed to sit nicely on top. It also seemed to make my pores look worse"

My skin feels smooth and fresh I recommend it. * Not as moisturizing as I would have wanted. My skin felt dry soon afterwards. Perhaps there is too much water in the formula which evaporates quickly. I prefer a slightly richer formula to nourish my skin. * I am in my late 20's and I notice my forehead was starting to have deep wrinkles and my neck was starting to form unappealing wrinkles. I tried this product out. After week, I definitely notice the difference on my forehead. The lines got softer.

I am appalled at how little product is in this HUGE jar. The exorbitant cost does not equate to how little product you actually receive. Save the planet, reduce plastic.

I will not be purchasing again. * Shocked as to how little of product waa in that jar! Tula do better! That jar wasnt even half full. So disappointing. * vitamin C is light sensitive, so the top being clear makes the product get stuck in the end of the pump and turn brown when exposed to sunlight. if it was in a totally light sensitive package it would be fine. also, the outer blue plastic ring on the top of my jar broke off, exposing more product to light. the product is fine and brightens the skin well, but i usually have to put a heavier moisturizer on top. id recommend pairing with sunscreen too. i like the shiseido one because its more oily and moisturizing on top of this. * I got this for free during a promo. I feel like it didnt moisturize well. My skin still felt dry (and my skin tends to be on the oily side) and even seemed flaky sometimes. Im glad i got it got free because it is pretty expensive. I wouldve expected it to be higher quality for the price. Also, if you put any toners or serums on before it doesnt mix well or really absord into your skin.  It turns white and takes a while to fully rub in. * I like this brand because it has good ingredients but this cream has a strange smell to it.  I want to say like a burning smell.  I prob will not purchase again. The price point is a bit high * I tried this mousturizer as a day cream and bought the white 24/7 mousturizer as a night cream. My face was covered in tiny bumps (fungal acne? Dermatitis?). Absolutelt do not recommend, it didnt even leave me moisturized. I cut out this moisturizer and the night cream separately to see which was causing problems and they both did. I stopped using the products and the bumps went away."

I wanted to use something a bit more natural. This helps with itching, redness and bumps. It's moisturzing as well. I really love using this lotion and I wish I had found this sooner. * I have very severe eczema and I have tried everything for my face rash. This cleared up the redness in 1-2 days and it also is helping clear up the flakiness on my face. I use it on my body too and it helps and feels very nourishing. * I have psoriasis and eczema and I have tried all kinda lotions. None of them seemed to have helped but I came across this and gave it a try. 

My skin was instantly moisturized and it dulled the redness even the reduced flakiness by alot. I'm impressed and am so excited that I've finally found something that actually works. * My daughters ezcema started getting bad again and we tried this for the first time and it worked !! The itch went away the first day and the rash started getting bettwr the second day ! * I have mild eczema on my fingers along with having sensitive skin on my face, so I thought this would be a nice moisturizer to help with both problems. I've tried La Roche Posay products before, so I was under the assumption this would be another worthwhile purchase. I bought this product two days ago and both times I've used it (immediately after washing my face), it's made my skin itchy, inflamed, and red. This evening, after applying it, my skin got so itchy and red I thought I was having an allergic reaction to my sheets or to one of my makeup brushes/products, but as soon as I washed my face again, the itchiness went away. I only thought to wash my face after reading a review of someone who experienced something similar to what I did. I was even about to take allergy medicine and apply cortisone to perhaps help with the itchiness and discomfort. I would NOT recommend this product whatsoever. * I have psoriasis and eczema. Ive been flaring recently due to the extreme weather. My face has a terrible rash that hasn't subsided. My left arm was so red, dry and itchy, no oils could heal it! 

Within an hour of applying I could see and feel a difference. My face started healing and skin stopped flaking. Break outs were becoming more controlled (clogging caused by psoriasis's 10x skin growth rate). Arm stopped itching and was no longer red! 

Normally I would never use a thick cream like this for my face! It had no burning and helped soothe my skin immediately. 

Very happy with this product! Helps a lot with soothing my autoimmune disease when everything else tends to flare it (yes even from the derm at months of use of products). * Made eczema worse on my face and boyfriend's hands"

It soaks in quickly, and my skin feels refreshed afterward. I don't see why I wouldn't continue to use this product. There is no scent, which I appreciate. * I liked. * I have had trouble finding a good go-to lotion thats not greasy, and this is amazing. I use it everyday AM and PM, and it leaves my face feeling so smooth and clean without the feeling of a heavy moisturizer. I would compare this to the belif aqua bomb, just even more lightweight. * I have sensitive skin so I was scared to try a new moisturizer. I did break out a little bit the first week (around the chin area) but after using for 2 weeks, my skin is in love !!! Super moisturizing and my skin feels great * I have very oily acne prone skin and it works very well. Not greasy at all, althpugh it is a gel. It goes on smooth and i love it. It does not have SPF so i do use an SPF after i use this. * This product absorbs quickly, but unfortunately, it caused a burning sensation on my skin upon application. It left dark spots on my skin due to burning. I couldn't put anything on for almost a week because it burned so badly. Definitely will not repurchase. I do love other products from Kiehls but this one isn't for me. * I may simply be allergic to an ingredient in this moisturizer as it has many positive reviews, but it burns every time I apply. On a more positive note, I didn't experience any additional breakouts."

My eyes are very sensitive and many moisturizers, and serums cause them to burn if I use them around my face.

It left a white cast, clumped up as I rubbed it in, and made my makeup sit poorly on my skin. My skin looked dry hours later.

The fact it contains the stable form of Vitamin C that most dermatologists prefer to recommend is of course THE reason to use it. I also LOVE that they didn't add fragrance to mask the  normal smell of the vitamin C ingredient. Yes, that odd ""hot dog?"" scent is just what the vitamin C smells like, and it dissipates in less than a minute. * Bought this product about a month ago, I was worried at first about spending so much money, but it was time to drop the dime. I'll be turning 35 soon and my skin was dull, dry and sometimes had red patches that would burn when using other creams, correctors and moisturizers.

Nope. This makes my skin feel and look so much better so I came back to this.  It's a perfect staple for long lasting moisture for face or body.. neck especially. It's nice and thick, has no scent and good for sensitive dry skin. Apply on damp skin! * I use this as my daily face moisturizer and it works great. This is a lotion, not a cream, so it's water based and works well for my oily skin because it absorbs quickly without residue. I like that it doesn't make it worse like other moisturizers (also doesn't cure my oiliness but thats not the point). It's an easy pump to grab in the mornings and has lasted me so long. Happy I found this product. * Loved the triple moisturizer. Trying this one out. Definitely a lighter cream but keeps face soft and smooth. * Every skin is different. The first fee times i used this product i loved it and loved the price. But it ended up ruining my skin, my skin broke out. I now have bunch of red dots on my face.

I have been using oil moisturizers as I thought they were lighter and absorbed quickly. But this cream is super light and absorbs quickly. it doesn't feel greasy and lasts all day. Now I can really feel the difference when I don't use it. If you are hesitant between this product and the triple repair one for extra dry skin I'd go with this one first.

Ive waited up to 2 hours before applying my foundation and the end result is a slippery, patchy, gunky mess. How a moisturizer that doesnt claim to be a night cream performs under makeup is very important to me, and for that I knocked off a star.

This product is loaded with silicones which creates that slippery surface but also keeps the moisture on your skin. It was weird to get used to at first but Ive grown to like it. Im oily and acne prone but was looking for something heavier since its been so cold and dry and this has worked great for me at night and on no makeup days with no breakouts. * i have never had allergic reaction to a product before this one, it was horrible it lasted for 5 days. my eyes completely swelled up and burned and all around my mouth area was red and itchy. so just beware something in this moisturizer had that effect on me! * Love this moisturizer!! It does not leave skin oily. Takes care of dry flaky skin on contact. Highly recommend. * This stuff is super moisturizing! If you've used the original Water Drench, it's like that but even more creamy.

It's great when you need an extra boost of moisture in dry climates, wintertime, after facial/microneedling, and if you have dry skin! 

I usually use serum before I put this on so I get some active ingredients on my skin and this feels like it seals in the serum nicely. 

I'm in my third jar! One word of caution: this might not be the best option for oily skin or in humid places and I usually alternate between this and a less dense cream. * I received a sample of this for my Ulta birthday gift and LOVE it so I bought the full size jar. It is truly the best and nicest feeling of the Hyaluronic moisturizers. Skin feels amazing!! * the texture is unique in that it feels like a hybrid of a cream and a gel, deff haven't tried a moisturizer like this before! it made my face have a silky feel, almost like there was a protective film.

I noticed the very next day I started getting micro bumps that resembled milia or granulomatous. I stopped wearing make up and switched to a gentle cleanser to see if those were the reasons however I remained applying the sunscreen to obviously help protect my face. To my surprise, my skin was only getting worse. It was starting to burn and itch. I've been allergy tested, and I don't have any. The day I didn't use the sunscreen, my skin condition immediately disappeared, so I went to look at the ingredients list. I don't know if Origins is using the oils from grapefruit, lemon and orange for fragrance purposes, but it does not list anywhere that they have extracted the furanocoumarins. After meeting with my dermatologist, I was advised that the citrus oils used in the sunscreen caused photosensitivity, and burned/ irritated my skin.

Started using this product again this week remembered why I love this! My face is becoming rehydrated again. The brightness is coming back and my rosacea is subsiding. I do have sensitive skin and this seems to do the trick to balance pH levels. If you have tried other products with no luck, try this product. Not every product fits everyone but this one is definitely worth the try. To me... worth every cent🙏 * 'My daughter is 14 and this product has been great for her acne * I love to try new products so I've experimented with a number of daily moisturizers with SPF like Drunk Elephant and Unseen Sunscreen and always come back to this Murad holy grail. It doesn't leave a white cast, is moisturizing, non-greasy, and doesn't pill under my makeup. I use this daily and a bottle lasts me roughly 4 months. I'm honestly shocked at other reviews saying they broke out as I have acne prone skin and never have but YMMV. * This is a decent sunscreen, rubs in fine and makes my skin soft. However this burns my eyes soooo bad. Obviously I know to not get sunscreen in my eyes, but it doesn't matter how carefully I put it on, my eyes burn. I have very sensitive & dry eyes and it just doesn't work. The Tula one in the yellow bottle, is the one I continue to go back too. * I was very excited to try this but was disappointed to find the results being similar to a drug store brand product not to mention this product caused my skin to break out and become oily. Never had those issues with my skin before starting to use this. Also the product just pours out of the bottle causing you to end up wasting product every time you use it which makes you run out a lot faster than you would expect. * I have heard great things about Murad so I finally decided to treat myself to this moisturizer. I wanted to love it SO bad but my skin has BLOWN UP with acne so bad, it's starting to really get to me. I used to struggle with acne but it had gotten to be almost non-existed until I bought this. At first I thought my pregnancy hormones had caused my flare up, and it could be a contributor, but this is really the only new piece of my skincare regimen and it seems like others have had the same bad experience as me too. Will be throwing it away and buying my old moisturizer. * As always, every experience can be different but I'll tell you mine: I have very sensitive skin , dry to normal, rarely have acne besides the occasional pimple. When I started using this, my face broke out like a crunch bar. TONS of bumps and several pimples. I started a new night cream at the same time so I wasn't sure, but as soon as I stopped using this my face cleared. It was pretty instant, at the end of the day the bumps were the worst and I would wash my face and wake up to no bumps (not what happens with typical acne). If you haven't heard of acne cosmetica, google it that way you can watch out for it with this product or any others. After looking closer I realized THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS SOME COMEDOGENIC INGREDIENTS (i.e. ethylhexyl palmitate)"
234,l'orÃ©al,age perfect cell renewal midnight hydrating serum,pimprod2027969,2586726," * gives my skin a healthy glow. no irritation and I'm sensitive. * Im 26 yrs old nursing school, full time job and full time mommy to a toddler, i looked older and tired all the time no matter how much make up i would put on. Im on day 2 and WOW my skin looks soooooo smooth and clear!! I noticed it got rid of my acne too!! 🥹 Love love it! Worth every peny! I used to buy the sunday riley luna sleeping night oil double the cost of this and have not seen this much improvement in such a short term like this!! * After a few days i noticed a cluster of bumps on my neck and chest area. I figured it was from something else like perfume, but then I noticed smaller bumps on my face. I don't consider my skin sensitive so i am surprised. I wish this worked out. * After having my baby, part of my postpartum recovery included extremely dry skin around my chin and T-zone area. It was SOOOOOO bad. My makeup application was the worst showing patchy skin. I tried so many things to help, including high-end luxurious products, but nothing worked until I tried this for weeks. I saw it changed the texture of my skin that included smoother and moisturized skin. I love it so much, I just bought a second one. The scent is also light. Nothing too crazy. This was good to my sensitive skin. Highly recommend!!!! * This product did make my skin feel feel and look amazing.  However, it also caused acne breakouts that I hadn't experienced in many years.  For that reason, I can't use this product.  I wasn't prone to breakouts so it was a bit surprising. * Smooth and penetrates well. Skin feels soft and smooth * Used 2 full bottles and feel very dry. Not the product for me."
235,tonymoly,wonder ceramide mochi water cream,pimprod2040801,2613434," * I was tired of having to repurchase an expensive moisturizer until I gave this product a try! Honestly work the money and the amount you get! Its hydrating and feels so good on my skin! It doesnt break me out and a little goes a long way! * After I came back to buy a second tub, I realized I had to write a review; it deserves a glowing one. This cream has soothed me and my skin (hands, neck, face) through multiple bouts of a compromised skin barrier, a rash or two, suspected eczema, and best of all, it leaves it hydrated and soft and not-angry. I keep it in the fridge. I aim to keep this cream on hand at all times whenever possible. This is an S tier product for me. * I wanted to love this but unfortunately broke me out in cystic acne. it has a very strong smell and I think that's why I broke out so bad. * so far everything but lancôme makes me break out until this! it's light and it smells a lil like lemon pledge but i'm so happy to find something my skin doesn't rebel over!! * I have been looking for an affordable lightweight moisturizure..comparable to tatch water cream, and similar to Neutrogena water cream and this to me is pretty comparable. I have normal skin. I have noticed it has helped my skin barrier and absorbs quickly, sits well under makeup, and doesn't pill for me. I do use Cocokind Vitamin C serum before using this to add a little extra moisture. However, my only con is it could be a tad more moisturizing. * I have normal/dry, acne prone, aging skin (I'm 35). I have been using this as a day moisturizer and love it. It doesn't clog my pores or cause breakouts, and it sits well under my SPF and foundation. It's hard for me to find a daytime moisturizer that is moisturizing enough without making my makeup look cakey, but this product is fantastic! It also smells really good which is a bonus. * Love this so much. Bought it on a whim in store because I need to add extra moisturizer to my routine for the upcoming winter and am on a c c u t a n e with horribly dry skin. This works more than I expected! After the first night of using it, i noticed my skin looked so plump and moisturized in the morning. No pilling, really light, soaks into the skin nicely without oily residue, and good to use all over the face/neck. Fragrance isn't anything special, light citrus-ish that goes away quikly. Wish it came in a body lotion too!!! Will buy again."
236,charlotte tilbury,magic water cream gel moisturizer with niacinamide,pimprod2043839,2620075," * This is rhe perfect not to heavy moisture but not to light! I gave this to my 3 year old and she absolutely loves it! I bought it a week ago and she alresh needs a new one! But im not even mad because it is so amazing! Eveeyone needs to buy this it is so good! * On the first and only try after putting it on,I felt a burning sensation and left my skin irritated. * I have dry skin and currently living in a dry climate as well. Ive tried the normal magic cream and it has vegetable oil, fragrance, just a lot of junk. Especially when my forehead can get closed comedones and breakouts easily. I took a gamble and bought the mini and fell in loveee!!! I am so dry in some areas i often peel, so i was prepared to give this away or return (i cant do gel or gel creams becuase of my dry skin). But i was so shocked at how hydrating this is and it make my skin so shiny and glowy and layers so beautifully under makeup. As a sensitive skin girly too, fragrance free is so important to me as fragrances can be irritating. Also, CT is certified cruelty free by leaping bunny, as a girl who lovess animals and only shops cruelty free, so important! Ive since bought the water cream set with the full size and mini that's on the way and I can't wait! Just try it! * Didn't absorb. Shiny. Expensive. * I use the old version and the new one. Both are amazing! It is expensive but its work it. It leaves my face hydrated and a great dewy look * I received this free from Charlotte Tilbury for my honest review. I have dry, very sensitive skin. When I first put this on my skin was glowing. After a few minutes it started to irritate my skin and I had to wash it off. Sadly this particular product was not for me. * I love all the Charlotte Tilbury products￼. I have the other magic cream and it's amazing. So I was very excited to try this one. I love this magic water cream. It is super soft and doesn't feel sticky."
237,beautybio,the zenbubble oil-free calming gel cream,pimprod2019384,2572411," * I got this and the eye cream, both burned my eyes and skin. I am sensitive but don't usually break out in a few hours from a product. Also were very sticky long after applying just them and no other products for self testing. * Far from a moisturizer but in fact left my skin super oily. * Hands down the best makeup primer EVER. Its too good. My makeup looks freshly applied all day long. I csnt say enough about it. * I spent alot on this and it did nothing for me. I like how the product is provided. The moisturizer itself caused skin irritation after I used appropriate face cleanser foe skin type. Not for eczema prone or sensitive skin! * The formula is fine—nothing amazing—and there are similar moisturizers at a more affordable pricepoint. I have combo sensitive skin and it didn't irritate my skin. I do really like it when i mix it with my retinol oil at night as it helps dry down the oil faster and keep in the moisture. The packaging is my favorite part with the pump top. When i'm out of this, i'll refill it with my cetaphil night cream. I got it when it was half off but i still think it's too expensive for what it is. * Ive been eyeing this product for a while but was put off by the price. I finally bought it on a whim one day and im absolutely in love! It feels so good on my face and doesnt feel  greasy! My skins appearance has overall improved as well! * This is seriously the best moistirizer ever made. Love it so much . My skin is flawless"
238,dune suncare,the mug guard broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2039109,2608975," * I like it! It's a small bottle, but, I like it! I think it lives up to it's claim: my face appears to be smoother, feels softer. * Bummer that this is now 5 mL smaller than before but costs exactly the same. * Not great for sensitive skin. I love a milky SPF for layering other products but even with a heavy moisturizer underneath it dried my skin and caused peeling and flaking * I go through sunscreen like its nothing because I tend to burn easily. This one is lightweight and comfortable. I wear it under makeup without any problems like some cause. The only downside is the price for the size youre getting, but otherwise I love this product and will be buying it again. * I love the texture and feel of this sunscreen and it doesn't cause acne for my very sensitive skin. Downside is it goes quickly and the price point is too high. * I have sensitive, dry skin. I'm newer to using sunscreen daily. I researched many brands and this had great reviews, so I bought it hoping for the best. Using it over my serums has helped them work their magic. My dark spots have eased up and my expression lines are less prominent. My skin is more hydrated and plump. I plan to keep using this because ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" and it works perfectly for me! Also, sometimes when I introduce a new product, my skin has a bad reaction (redness, irritation, breakout) and this sunscreen has not caused any negative reactions. * It is not as good as people are saying in the reviews. Yes, it blends out well but it just stays on top of your skin and leaves you with a greasy feeling. Also, for the price… definitely not worth it. I couldnt even finish the whole bottle because it was breaking me out so bad. Some people are saying its good for people with acne prone skin but as someone with acne prone skin, yeah it is not it. I gave it to a relative because i didnt want to be wasteful and even they didnt like it and theyre honestly not that picky with their skincare. Korean sunscreens are the way to go especially if youre acne prone and the prices are a lot more cheaper!"

Love it * My skin feels smooth and moistureized. * This is my night cream ever night.  It works, It does not irritate my skin. What's not to love about that? * I received a sample of this and did wear sunscreen during the day. The first night it went on everything seemed fine. It went on with no problem. The second day I felt a little tight itching? By the third day I started seeing peeling around my nose and my face felt itchy and burny. Not an overwhelming itch but enough to recognize I'm having a bad reaction. Peeling, itching and a slight burning sensation. I didn't use makeup the first two days but when I put makeup on the third day, it went on blotchy and I could see the irritation on my cheeks, mostly below my eye area. I'm Pacific Islander, NC30 and in my 40's, sadly this product is not for me. * Product is usually good. But got a bad batch and felt bad so I didn't bring it back.  Cream is old and had been sitting on the shelf for a while."

I do two layers before going to bed, its so good! I also enjoy the smell as well and its not too overpowering. The price is ok and I enjoyed it more than the Tatcha water cream I tried and its a lot more expensive! * I recommend this product to EVERYBODY. This stuff right here has completely changed my life. I get compliments on my skin all the time since ive started using this in 2022. I will never stop using it!!! * I have used this product every day, twice a day since 2017. I absolutely love it! It is lightweight, dries down smooth, and helps hydrate my oily sensitive skin. I would cry if FAB ever discontinued this product. 1000% would recommend. * This is a great moisturizer super lightweight better for like oily or skin types. But I like it as a quick little water cream to add to whatever else I'm using for the day. Smells delicious and love coconut so for me, this is a must have! * This product is amazing, it's so light weight and smells amazing. Would definitely recommend * i really loved the product and how it made my skin feel but i went thru the whole thing in one month!!! i can't be buying this every month for that price :/ * If you have acne or just skin in general you NEED this is in your life!"

243,good light,order of the eclipse hyaluronic cream,pimprod2033460,2597528," * I was attracted to the packaging and the name of this cream, so I decided to try it. It's nongreasy, unscented formula glides onto the skin smoothly. It's lightweight and is great for morning and night use. I like it so much that I went back to buy more ""good light"" products! * My new go to moisturizer! I have sensitive combo skin and my skin just loves the hydration this leaves all day. My skin feels so soft and healthy after using it. Nice enough in the summer alone but even better for the fall/winter in the midwest over their abc oil. Fragrance free too. * I really like this face cream for the winter. I live in a high desert climate and have combination skin; this isn't great for all year long but in the winter it's perfect especially after a day outside in harsh conditions. Definitely not lightweight and would be too heavy/ oily for someone with oily skin or in a humid climate but it's great when I need it! As a bonus, I love the packaging. It's not my holy grail and it's more expensive for the size than some other creams that do essentially the same thing but it does it's job well! * Im very picky on what i use on my skin, and this is my holy grail!! I just purchased my 4th bottle today. Its thick and will last all night keeping you moisturized. Its light scented as well! The bottle isnt super huge and its a bit pricey but definitely worth it! * This moisturizer is nothing short of amazing! Perfect! I've tried them all. This is rich, thick, and best of all..no scent! This pairs so nicely with the milky toner and my retinol and vitamin C regiment. * This stuff is by far the top budget-friendly cream I have purchased! It rivals the ones that are over $100. * The best cream? Yes. I haven't ever tried this brand until now – and I'm a believer. It's essential for every person who need hydration and loves softer skin!"

Peter Thomas Roth is the best! * I was skeptical at first, but have noticed less wrinkles under my eyes and my makeup applies smoother * Amazing peptide complex and anti aging results * I splurged on this product as I felt my skin needed just a good moisturizer that locked everything in and protected it. The product is heavier than most but I feel it does a great job of hydrating my skin. The biggest con I have is the blue painted lid on the jar peels and leaves blue fragments of paint in the product, thus it going on my face. My fingertips are physically blue after simply unscrewing the cap. It actually concerns me because you never know what companies are using to manufacture their products. Disappointed with such a high price point. * Ive been using PTR products for 10+ years and my skin shows amazing results from the use of these products over the years. I'm a satisfied customer for life."

I agree with others it's a little tacky feeling but subsides fairly quick. That being said I give it 4 stars. My skin after a few days is more hydrated and healthier looking. * As someone who is always looking for the absolute most lightweight possible lotion, this is a great option for keeping winterttime dryness away without feeling weighted down. Otherwise, it would be a little bit too heavy for my personal taste during warmer months. * As someone who is always looking for the absolute most lightweight possible lotion, this is a great option for keeping winterttime dryness away without feeling weighted down.

It's not for oily skin it feels greasy and it clogged pores * The best moisturizer I've tried for my dry, acne-prone skin. It leaves a beautiful glow and feels good on my skin. A little goes a long way so I don't have to waste all the product trying to not feel dehydrated. It's perfection in a bottle I'd recommend it to anyone. * Works great.

248,hero cosmetics,clear collective clarifying prebiotic moisturizer,pimprod2030350,2591989," * I've tried many moisturizers (high end & affordable) for sensitive/acne prone skin and this is by far the best moisturizer, especially for the price! I use this with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide or salicylic acid and it pairs well with all my serums and sunscreen. This is also great under makeup since it's not oily and helps makeup last longer. I've repurchased this moisturizer at least 4 times and I always have a backup! * I love that this moisturizer is buildable. You xan relaly control how much you need. It feels great on my skin and my skin is noticeably more plump. I love it! * I am acne-prone but need a moisturizer for skin dryness, especially during the winter when the cold wind easily dries out your skin. After using this moisturizer, I have had several instances of bad luck with getting a new pimple the next morning. The texture and application (no burning) of this product are fine. It does its job to moisturize the skin. However, not without suffering more blemishes sadly. I picked this while trying to find noncomedogenic moisturizers with clean ingredients according to Yuka, but my mom helped point out to me later this has vegetable oil in it… Cool! 🙃 * its just perfect and a little goes a long way * I dont really know what people are saying about this product, most people are saying its lightweight and non greasy but it feels so heavy, sticky, and greasy on my face, maybe just not for me but I won't be buying this again * I have sensitive skin and this works well for me. Love that it isnt too heavy on my combo/acne prone skin * I was hoping this product would work well on my acne-prone skin, but it doesn't seem to do much for me. It doesn't absorb very well into the skin so the more you use the more ends up sitting on your face. The claims about this moisturizer being pre-biotic don't seem to mean much. Hero specializes in products for acne and acne-prone skin, so I assumed this moisturizer would work well in my routine and be hydrating but I was disappointed."

I look 15 years older. Literally does the opposite of what it's suppose to. Now I'm just praying these new wrinkles fade. * It's just temporary, so keep that in mind. * These are not very strong and theyre small. If you havent tried ""frownies"" i suggest trying those. Theyre cheaper for a larger quantity and better results. * I tried these on a few spots on my face, under eyes, smile lines, and 11 lines on forehead. I honestly wouldnt bother using these under your eyes because the adhesive is so strong it pulls at your skin even with wetting them. They did work well on my smile lines and 11 lines but they just soften the wrinkles, my results only lasted about 1 week. Personally I'd invest in a good quality eye cream over using these patches. * I love this idea and if it worked it would be cool but they don't stay on - followed directions to a ""t"" and still fell off within the hour. Returned them to the store as defective * comes off if I move my face :-( * Terrible"

I like how light it is, the price point, the volume of product, the consistency, & how long the bottle lasts. Its travel - friendly and good for all skin types. * This moisturizer is great for the summer or daytime, but personally its too lightweight for my combo skin. Its more hydrating than moisturizing and has a gel like texture. I gave it to my roommate who has oily skin and she loves it * It has helped me a lot with managing my breakouts along with clarifying toner. They really are a great combo to use. All the ingredients are clean and i havent had any type of allergic reaction. Ive scanned it the bottle for acnegenic and condemenic ingredients and it had none and then i also scanned it for toxins and it had none. Overall i would recommend to anyone unless they're specifically looking for a matteifying moisturizer. This oil free moisturizer gives you a slight sheen and glow. * New favorite! This has been amazing for my combo skin. My skin stays hydrated all day long but doesn't get oily. Great as a base layer under make-up, doesn't pill. * lightweight moisturizer , made skin smooth  , I Don't Think this moisturizer won't break you out !!! * i love this moisturizer, its perfect for layering! especially for skincare routines & when applying spf and makeup * I initally didnt like this mosituriser as the birch smell is a little odd…like a tree. But i reallt liked the lightness and the way it absorbs. So ive gotten use to the scent. This is the perfect day moisturizer as its light and absorbs well. I have dry somewhat sensitive skin.

Unreal/ must try! * I do not want my face smelling like vanilla frosting but it did the whole time I used this. My fault but I'd literally have to hold my breath * Earlier this year my dermatologist informed me I have seborrheic dermatitis. I've been using ketoconazole shampoo which definitely helps but I still found myself needing to use cortisone cream on my face (gross!!). So I was researching moisturizers good for dermatitis and while Supermello isn't specifically marketed for dermatitis (it does list eczema) I thought it sounded like it may help. I am SO GLAD I gave it a chance!!!!! its been about 2 weeks now and my face is looking the best it's looked in several years. Patches that I thought were stubborn acne have been clearing up and are almost totally gone. the hydration level us just right so I feel moisturizes but don't get greasy as the day goes on. It does smell REALLY lovely with the light vanilla/Marshmallow aroma. Definitely worth trying if you have skin conditions that make you red/itchy! * I got this as a sample and wowww the smell is so good! It's very creamy so a little goes along way! Im so happy I got it as a sample because now Im definately buying more. I love this brand and it also makes my skin glowy and so soft. I love how my skin feels I usually use their Vitamin C then put on this cream and it leaves my skin poreless and soft. * My skin burns from water, I swear. I am incredibly sensitive to everything. My skin chaps, get red and raw, itches and burns. I have tried most of the major 'sensitive' skin moisturizers high to low end, and this is the absolute winner. Keeps my skin moisturized and smells great. I have found it does not do well under makeup so I only use at night and for the first time, thats enough moisture for me. * I've been using this moisturizer for a few years now and I LOVE it! This is the only lotion I've found that leaves me with no irritation or redness. Highly recommend! * I've gone through a couple jars of this moisturizer - it's incredibly rare to find one that truly doesn't clog my pores, and despite some highly comedogenic ingredients, this one surprisingly does not break me out at all. Also makes my skin incredibly soft. Unfortunately, however, as I continued to use this, noticed my pores becoming increasingly large and more noticeable, and my skin texture getting worse and worse. Stopped using for a few weeks (keeping everything else in my routine the same) and my  texture is looking quite a bit better. So, no go for me."

I use it at night. My skin feel soft and hydrated in the morning. I especially love that it is cruelty free. * This is my go to day moisturizer.

Def buying another tube! * I have and oily T section and my skin becomes especially red or dry around my cheeks and chin right before my period. I've tried a lot of SPF and finally found one that doesn't leave me ultra shiny and oily.  I really like this product and will keep using it! Only downside is that I think some of the oils in the product settled and the last couple of uses did leave my skin somewhat shiny but other than that, my skin was left soft and even toned! * Contains harmful chemicals that damage our coral reefs. Please make smart consumer choices, this sunscreen is not environmentally safe and my face broke out when using it :( * this sunscreen gave me such a healthy glove, and my skin did not feel oily or greasy at!!!! I used to have the Laroche poosay (I hope i spelled it right) sunscreen, and it would make my skin shiny, but it all oily. I have normal skin and I really love this product. * I'm in my 30's and have always had acne prone, oily skin. A few years ago, I was able to clear up my skin with a strict morning and night routine that includes prescription creams, but every time I would try using SPF, I would immediately break out. I've tried dozens of prestige and drugstore brands! This moisturizer with SPF is the first that hasnt caused a single breakout. I've been using it for over a month now and I will continue to as long as its on shelves. * This product is okay as a moisturizer and sunscreen but leaves you shiny looking. It also does not work well under makeup at all. I learned the hard way after I was almost completely done with my makeup and it began lifting and leaving ugly peeling patches when i used a powder brush. For the price, theres way better sunscreens out there. The murad sunscreen in a blue bottle is about the same size and the same price but works amazing. * I switched to this sunscreen and my pores and oily skin were controlled also my skin felt amazing! I could t rebuy it because I was pregnant but whenever I get my hands on this again I would gladly stick to this only. The only con is the size and price"

You have to experience this to believe it. My skin has become so soft and younger looking. I will definitely keep this in my beauty routine * I mean it...when I say I am nearly 30 and struggled with hormonal skin since I was 12..I have spent SO much money on skincare products, it's insane. Recently I bought a $150 moisturizer claiming it was magic, when THIS..PUR Cloud Cream (for a fraction of the price)..was all I've ever wanted and needed. It is the silkiest product and it just melts into the skin like a drink for your pores. I mix it with a dab of Charlotte Tilbury ""beautiful skin"" foundation and I feel like a million bucks. Immediate confidence boost. It's just enough tint to perfect the redness from my acne and scars...and it leaves the most gorgeous finish, like I just got back from the medspa and my skin is plump, hydrated, and GLOWING. I got this as a sample from Ulta and I had to come back here, buy the full size immediately, and leave a review. I knew nothing about it so when I searched it up I was expecting this to be much more expensive. A double win for it's attainable price!! Please never discontinue. * I am allergic to tocopherol acetate, and this is the only moisturizer I can find at Ulta without it. Thank goodness it works well. Feels nice, not greasy. Absorbs quickly, and isnt strong smelling. * This is one of the only things I can use on my face! I dont have to worry about my face sweating when
I wear it. It is lightweight and is scent free! * Okay so. I have extremely finicky, super sensitiveGr, combination skin. Ive tried lots of moisturizer brands such as Clarins, CosRx, Drunk Elephant, and Beauty Counter. As great as they worked, my skin sucked up the creams too fast and didnt last me throughout the whole day. Serums helped, but would cause me to break out in consistent trouble spots. The way it sat on my skin did NOT feel even. Rough versus smooth. And when using foundation, you could see the different textures. 

Since using Pür Cloud Cream, I can honestly say this is one of the most amazing products Ive ever tried?? 
When applying, a little is a lot. It smoothes out so evenly, feels cold and refreshing right off the bat. I let it sit about a minute or two, did a test feel of my skin. Let me tell you, the texture was IMMEDIATELY consistent over my whole face. Trouble areas such as the nose, above my lips, smile lines, and eyebrows were rich and hydrated. Im actually kind of shook how quickly, too.

When using foundation, it gave an airbrushed feel and look. My skin still felt smooth! And was definitely still hydrated. 

So excited for trying this product. Will DEFINITELY buy it again. * Lightweight and goes on smooth"

Great product! * Truly oil free. I have oily skin so I can immediately pick up on oily products. Very light weight and good texture. Best I've used so far. * Great product * I had started using the Bareminerals Skin Longevity line but didn't quite care for the daily moisturizer with sunscreen so I bought this product.  I am 60 yoa and have struggled with acne and skin problems since I was a teenager.  I believe it's mostly due to bad genes because my sisters and daughter also had acne problems. This moisturizer absorbs well, but because it is oil free, it doesn't leave my skin shiny or greasy looking. It makes my skin feel fresh and smooth. I do not look my age and I believe that using these Baremineral products contribute to my better looking skin. * I use this daily after cleansing. It is light-weight but easily covers my face & neck. It isn't oily at all. I have used other products in the past. They cause breakouts and leave my face feeling greasy all day or soak in immediately & don't create a good foundation. * Best moisture I have ever used. A little goes a long ways.  My skin has never felt or looked this good. Absolutely love this product.  Please don't ever stop selling this."

I noticed how smooth, how easy to smile it was, and what a big difference it was from the previous years. Using the whole set it's very expensive but if you are careful and use them as indicated they last.  I bought mine on October 2022 and run out of them in February 2023 bravo!!!  And that was because I had to travel to different countries so I ended taking small amounts in my containers when I when to Europe. Then on my way back I travel to Mexico so I took all the bottles because I was going to stay there 3 months. Then my set got finished there   I checked in the fine stores in Mexico but there were no Refills so I had to I'm wait till I return to USA to buy them. I'm strongly recommending the Lancôme Absolute products they all wonderful! Use them carefully and daily! * I love this product, and I've tried quite a few high end moisturizers. I'm 52 a post menopausal. I only gave it 4* because of the price, and the fragrance.  Most over the age of 50 will likely remember a bottle of White Shoulders sitting on their grandmother or mother's vanity, and that's what the smell of this cream reminds me of. Very floral and not just roses. I can live with the price, but I would definitely give it 5* if Lancôme would make a fragrance free version. The fragrance doesn't linger, but the smell reminds me of what old women smelled like when I was a child."

I have combination/oily skin and as much as I loved the products I always struggled with oiliness. I decided to take a break a couple years and I regret it. My skin has significantly changed and not for the better. I tried so many new products and nothing compared. I came back to Estee Lauder and decided to try this Nutritious line, and I absolutely love it!!! This one does not make me oily or shiny and I love the way my Estee Lauder foundation sits on my skin. I will say I bought a whole regime and I'm using the Nutritious essence and moisturizer, and the Perfectionist serum and SPF. I got them on sale during Black Friday sales recently and I couldn't be happier. I can say this moisturizer is making all the difference for me. * Not for me feels to heavy * I have quite dry skin and this product just doesnt work with my skin type. Makes my face look and feel dehydrated. I can maybe understand why this would work for oily folks but not enough for dry skin. * I got this creme in the Glow kit. When I cleanse my face, I apply it as a standalone and immediately see my face turn red. I have sensitive skin, plus large pores. :( * I don't see the hype. Texture of cream felt like light face lotion and went on just the same. I've used it twice as an over night mask and I woke up with dry skin. My Elemis night cream is 5x more nourishing than this ""face mask"" cream. * I live in the Arctic and the cold sucks any moisture out of my skin. I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts from moisturizers and new products. Basically if you touch it, it's going to have issues. I received a sample of this with my last makeup order and this stuff is amazing! I have been using it as my daily moisturizer and my skin is soft, hydrated, and most of all clear! I will be adding this to my daily routine. * I got this in a sample when it first launched and fell in love! however since I've gone through almost an entire full size jar, its just not hydrating enough for my skin even though I am very oily! I have acne prone skin and am super picky with ingredients so I had super high hopes, but it sadly fell flat. on goes my search for my favorite all day & night moisturizer 🥲"

Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy! * I can't believe it took me so long to find this amazing product. I will have it a part of my skin routine forever now! Such a great lotion for my whole body. Highly recommend purchasing if you have dry and sensitive skin. Game changing product so excited I found it! * As someone with dry and flaky skin, I've tried countless lotions over the years, but none have worked as effectively as this one.

The lotion has a rich, creamy texture that absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. My skin feels immediately hydrated and smooth after applying it."

My skin is really happy. In two weeks it has reduced redness, dryness, and you can't see the lines on my forehead anymore. So if you want results without all the harsh chemicals this is the cream for you. * Been using this for a couple of years. This product usually lasts me 5 months. Am glad for that! * I love how it feels as I am applying it. It feels wonderfully soft and smooth. Will be purchaching more! Love It! * My skin was looking dull and dreary. I love bare minerals powder foundation, so thought I'd try their skin care. The ageless line is lovely, leave my skin clear, bright and smooth. My friends commented after only a week about how great my skin looked! * I love the night cream. It is easy to use and I can feel the cream working at night. It is light and clean feeling. I will be using it all the time. * I bought this face cream in a small travel size to see if I liked it. It's great! Keeps my skin hydrated and soft. * I use this product at night when I'm settling down and wait for my skin to absorb. I can tell a big difference and I love it."

265,pacifica,future youth moisturizing super cream,pimprod2042626,2617977," * Just as it says in the title. I use this moisturizer in my night routine because of how moisturizing it is. 
Yes, it does pill if it is not the last step in your routine. It is my 2nd to last step, and depending on how long I wait to apply the oil afterwards, affects how intensely the moisturizer pills. The moisture and effectiveness is worth it though. If I can't give a good 10 minutes before applying oil, then I will just skip the oil that night. * Biggest disappointment from Ulta so far… not moisturizing… for some reason it dehydrates my skin… dont waste your $$$ * This works great! A little goes a very long way. It's very moisturizer yet not oily. I love this night cream. * Doesn't absorb into the skin as quickly as I would like, but once it is, my face and neck are so bright and refreshed. * Keep The Phenoxyethanol out of products please! 
If Europe can ban Endocrine disruptors why cant we. 
This is like the only ""clean brand"" in the states. So dissapponting.. * I have combo acne prone skin for reference. 
This is like a light watery lotion but absorbs like a rich cream. It soaks right in and paces a velvety, supple feeling that I love. Sometimes my skin is drier so I could see me being able to use this during the day also without being too heavy. It does have a scent. It's like candy strawberry and flowers. It's light and goes away very shortly. You only need a little of this because it spreads so well. It can be easy to go overboard. I think this is definitely worth the money given the ingredients, packaging and how long this will last. Especially compared to other creams. I don't breakout but wake up with super soft, nourished skin. * I want to love this product so badly but the fragrance/essential oils in this caused my eczema to flare up. I'm so sad but I know it's on me for buying something with fragrance, natural or not. Otherwise I think it's a nice product it wasn't drying or anything and the texture is really nice just wish they had a fragrance free version. I will stick with the vegan ceremide cream"

I went out on a limb to try this 2 in 1 sunscreen and it did not disappoint. Great mattifying and no white cast (I'm a brown skin gal) yet moisturizing. I took this on vacation and it withstood the very hot heat and sun. Two thumbs up for me. * My previous tube was great. Mattified the skin. Absorbed quickly. It did not make my skin oily. This newest tube is not good. While it still absorbs quickly it does not mattify my skin. I am very oily in a couple of hours if not before. I must note that i do shake the tube before use so i dont think im missing anything. * I used this as a cheaper alternative toy usual SPF  but it was greasy and broke me out. If i dont shake it i can see the oil. * I bought this sunscreen on accident because I thought it was a free gift and didn't check until I picked it up in store. However, I decided to use it because I needed a new sunscreen and surprisingly, this worked very well for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it sits on top of my other skin care products very well. This is also the first sunscreen that hasn't irritated my skin or burned my eyes which I truly appreciate because every sunscreen I've worn in the past had an extremely painful reaction on my eyes. I plan on repurchasing. * I use this product for daily use. It is lightweight and keeps your face clear and oil free. * i'm so glad i found this sunscreen! beginning with the biggest pros for me- i've seen no new breakouts, doesn't pill, and feels like nothing on my skin. i really hate when i can feel an spf on my face but with this product my skin feels light and clean. pilling and clinging to dry patches is very annoying and i've noticed ZERO pilling/exaggerating of dry patches. 

the few cons i have are very nitpicky- fairly strong smell and isn't mattifying. the smell is almost floral but mostly is just a normal sunscreen smell, which isnt a huge deal to me but might be too much for those sensitive to fragrance. i also wouldn't consider this a mattifying products which i actually prefer. theres little to no added shine but again, not very mattifying.

overall i'm so glad i finally found an spf that works on my skin! * Considering I have very oily skin, this didnt moisturize my skin at all. I had to use it as a straight up sunscreen over my regular moisturizer which defeated the purpose for me. It was defined mattifying to the point of drying."

Cleanser feels clean w/o stripping. The extolment stings and works! The moisturizer also stings a bit but feels great on! Sensitive skin beware. * This is a great deal! Yes, the one product is smaller than they said in the details, but all of these still last a long time. The face wash has a really nice light citrus smell. I havent used the moisturizer yet because I couldnt read what it was exactly or when to use it (before looking it up) because the white writing on the transparent container was impossible to read on top of being partially rubbed off. So thats my only complaint. * Said the intense exfoliating treatment is a 1.7 Oz in description.  That is a lie.   It is only .05 Oz.   Not pleased. Want want I thought I ordered or a refund"

Just ordered my third bottle, I use it daily and absolutely love it! It has helped so much with my skin, it does not iritate it at all (i have sensitive acne prone skin with rosacea) and leaves it feeling so smooth! I have not been breaking out as much since using this, in fact this product helps to keep my skin at bay when it comes to breakouts and random pimples. Cannot recommend it enough! * Very light toner, makes my skin look and feel amazing, I definitely notice that my skin looks rougher when I run out and don't have a back up bottle. * This is the best toner you could buy. Love that they use clean ingredients. Its very gentle if u have sensitive skin but still removes dirt, excess oils, etc. its a must buy, along with the other skin care products they have < 3 * This product has immensely improved my skin clarity (tone, brightness, fading pigmentation) along with leaving the skin feeling extremely hydrated and smooth. * I've purchased this toner twice now and I absolutely love it. It's the only toner I use in the morning and it's perfect for makeup prep! Don't let the size fool you- my first bottle lasted me about 5 months!

Aveeno, please don't change this formula ever!! * I am happy this product does not dry out my skin, but I don't feel it will protect my face from sunburn.  That being said, my face was peeling because of the high strength of my lotion. At least it is now not peeling. * The moisturizer did help with my overall skin/was a decent moisturizer, but the pilling is/was so bad, almost constant, even hours after application. It also doesn't sit well under any make-up, even a just light skin tint. The smell is strong, but it honestly just smells like soap so that wasn't an issue for me and I kind of liked it. * This product is light and smells good.  I love that it has SPF. * I've used it for over 10 years. There's been changes with it over the years, but my skin soaks it up like a sponge and leaves me glowing. * Broke me out in hives! I have sensitive skin and for 3 days my skin was a flame. It finally erupted into hives on the 3rd day. Everything irritated my skin after using this. Do not try this product if you have sensitive skin. Opt for Dermalogica. * New formulation is terrible. 
I've been using this moisturizer for years! I always get compliments on my skin, it's been my go to forever. I even mix a little of it into my foundation the past few years when i want a more sheer coverage. 

They changed the formula and this one is not a winner. It instantly pills. Doesn't absorb. Right after putting it on, my face feels dry. I am so so disappointed and on the hunt for a new moisturizer."

I am almost 45 but I don't look it. * My beauty consultant, Beautifull (yes! that is her name) is the best in the business! I had so many questions when I was looking for a skin routine. I must say my skin is WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. She is located in North Texas! * I stopped buying moisture surge (and clinique in general) earlier this year, and searched for a comparable moisturizer all of 2024. Out of the 15 products I tried this year, this has been the best option by far. I honestly think this gel moisturizer is even better than Clinique's because it's fragrance free and 100% cruelty free. So many moisturizers are also too heavy for my sensitive and acne prone skin, but this is so lightweight and absorbs quickly. It's definitely worth the price, and a little goes a long way. * This is so light and so hydrating, it does not leave any sticky residue on the skin and no harsh smell. It cools the face and gives it a nice glow * I'm in my mid 40s, with sensitive combination skin, and this gel cream has been absolutely fantastic!  My previous moisturizer was a bit too heavy, and this one is just right for day and night use!!! * This product is going back! It was recommended to me because they were out of stock of my go-to product (a different brand). Upon applying a thin layer of Tula 24-7 Weightless Moisture Day & Night Gel Cream to my face and neck, something instantly felt off. The texture was fine so I couldn't place what it was. A minute or so later it started - the slight face burning. Minutes passed and it got to the point I couldn't ignore it and had to wash my face yet again just to get it off! * I received this as a free sample and now I'm hooked. It works so great for my skin. It leaves it refreshed without being heavy. Other moisturizers can be too thick but this is thin and blends perfectly. Worth the purchase!"

I own the tinted version as well, but feel like the tinted makes me look greasy after an hour... where as this version is more of a satin finish where I do not look greasy throughout the day (maybe a little bit on my nose after 6 hours of wear). If you're sensitive to chemical sunscreens, I will say I notice my eyes get a tad bit irritated from it after about 6 hours of wear also. I try to not get close to my eye area, especially on my eyelids with this version. Overall would repurchase. The Paula's Choice Youth Extending Fluid is very close to this with 50spf and I feel doesn't give me the sensitivity. * I work at ulta and I personally would not recommend this to anyone. Ive tried to use this many different ways and everytime Ive used it, it pills up immeditaly even with no other product and others that are also water based. * Have complained about packaging previously -- the convex bottom cap will not sit upright on shelf / counter. Then I couldn't access any product from the pump / tube so I returned it for an in-store replacement. This tube feels light weight-wise, but I am able to pump product out of tube. Suggest you return to previous packaging that had no issues. Meanwhile I'm looking around for a replacement. * Perfect sunscreen.  Lightweight yet moisturizing. * I used my sister's.  I really liked it.  Easy to use, it didn't leave a white cast, I like everything about it.  I have to buy my own now.  My sister won't let me have hers! * I have been on the hunt for months for a moisturizer with SPF that isnt overly dewy in order to skip a step in my routine and thought this might be the answer based on the reviews I read. This might work great if you wear foundation daily or are under 30 with no texture, and yes this doesnt feel greasy or oily BUT it makes me look greasy and oily. I only spot conceal on most days and when I use this I have to put powder on my face because it makes me look so shiny, and the powder doesnt really stick in areas i dont have makeup on. For the price I really dont think i will keep it. * The cap bottom is concave so it doesn't want to sit upright on a flat surface in my bathroom. 
Please leave well enough alone.

You can also get this product in their acne clearing kit, along with a foaming face wash and spot treatment. Love it! * Got this moisturizer as a wake me up for the cooling effect, but the amount of product doesnt even cross the verticle E in ""clear"" written on the front of the bottle. Highly disappointed because had i noticed before using it, I would have returned it. * As someone that's been struggling with finding a good moisturizer for my oily skin I am very impressed I struggle with oily skin so bad and it his moisturizer doesn't leave a shine and controls the oil :) * The only thing I really dislike is the scent I cannot figure out what it smells like (I've read the ingredients it's a lot of flowers) but I hate it.

277,pacifica,vegan collagen every day lotion spf 30,pimprod2017151,2566493," * I generally love Pacifica and have only purchased vegan/cruelty free products for the past 30 or so years. My usual store didn't have Andalou SPF face lotion anymore, which I've used religiously and happily for many years, and this was the closest alternative. I have never had a bad reaction to any lotion but this one irritates my eyes horribly, to the point of not being able to drive safely and having to wash my face and flush my eyes. Do not recommend! * I love this brand and I was excited to find a daily moisturizer from them with spf and even went through several bottles but I had to stop using it because it caused my eyes to burn and water profusely. I would also add that it has a very oily finish, so if you have oily or combo skin, this likely isn't for you. * I've used this through a couple of bottles. My skin takes time to adjust to products (hence why the couple of bottles). 

I love that it is cruelty free and has vegan collagen. I love that it has SPF 30, a must for me, BUT it smells like sunscreen. It is definitely moisturizing, I don't have an issue with dry skin, BUT it's rather greasy. My daughter has even commented that my face is really greasy when I wear it (not really the vibe I'm going for). The chemicals burn my eyes as the day goes on. If I even wipe my eyes, it takes me minutes to wipe away whatever traces of this moisturizer is around my eyes. If I regularly wore makeup, this would be extra problematic. If you wear contacts, I do not recommend this. Imagine that burning getting caught up under your contacts.

I really, really wanted to love this because I didn't want to go through having my skin adjust to a new product, but I can't justify it based on it being a habit. * As mentioned by others, this would be more accurately described as ""SPF 30 sunscreen with collagen."" Smells exactly like a normal drugstore sunscreen. It's light and doesn't feel too greasy (but there is still a bit of that feeling). Overall it's ok * Just finished my bottle and ordered another one.  I have sensitive, adult cystic acne, 44 yr old skin that is in the normal to dry stage. This product:
1) has a sunscreen like feel to it when you first apply it, then it fades away
2) has a great glass bottle that you can get ALL of the product out of!
3) Spreads well- at little goes a long way- to much will make it sticky and it won't dry down fast
4) plays well with Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid serum and PUR love your selfie foundation. * I'm getting older, and my skin is changing, and I hate it. My old favorite daily moisturizer/SPF by No. 7 started making me breakout after years of no problems, so I had to search for something new. All the others I tried that claimed to not clog pores also happened to be too drying for my slightly oily but aging but still acne prone and also kinda dehydrated skin (ugh). But the moisture level of this Goldilocks cream is just right. If you have dry or slightly dry skin you will probably like it, if you are 40+ you will probably like it, if you're young and have oily skin you might NOT like it because it is not a light liquid, it's definitely a thick-ish cream. I can tell the fragrance they were trying for was *floral* but it leans more chemical, although it disappears in a minute or two. After application the skin feels moist, but not greasy. Makeup applies perfectly over it with no pilling at all. I somehow manage to not look shiny over the course of the day, which is practically miraculous. It doesn't seem to make me break out, as I've been using it for several weeks with no notable flares. I am relieved to have found my new favorite! * i like how this spf does not leave a white cast like other spfs. Plumped my skin right up and gave it a nice silky glow."

It does nothing for my skin… super greasy, no firming, and makes my skin look worse. For the price I expected at least a decent product. In my opinion there are SO many great moisturizers out there that out perform this and are cheaper. * Bought this because I like the day cream version a lot.  This however was just not a great formulation for me.  It simply NEVER absorbs into my skin and then it just rubs off on my pillow case or hands eventually.   And I don't use an excessive amount because of the price tag.  I'm a big fan of using the minimal amount required.  It's too late to return it, so it's just going to move into my graveyard of products that I can't bare to throw away because, $$$, but just don't work on my skin.  Le sigh.  But, I still love the extra firming day cream and all my other Clarins products.  I would recommend trying a sample of this before buying if possible so you know if it's a good consistency for your skin. * Excellent result 👍 * Light weight, non greasy.  Plant enriched.  Vegan.  Long lasting.  Eco friendly packaging. * Really recommend this line for girls after 50. I feel my face firming after second week and continue improving. * This product is amazing!"

It also went bad pretty quickly and started to smell like pungent onions (no smell initially). * Great intro to retinol. I have sensitive, acne prone, oily skin. This did not irritate my skin, and honestly it has improved my acne. My skin has never looked better with Cosrx and i've been struggling with my skin since middle school. I am now 26. * This stuff is GOLD. I had never used retinol and read that a small percentage is the best way to start and wow. Every night I put this on my skin is instantly dewy, glowy, and looks so fresh. It's been a game changer in my skin care routine"
280,origins,dr. andrew weil mega-mushroom soothing treatment lotion,pimprod2031368,2593778," * I thought i was getting a cream lotion but no, this is a liqued, you apply it like a serum/toner before your serums and moisturizers. But the product is hydrating but does not reduce redness as much as i hoped it would. * Helps SO much with redness from sun damage! * I Have Used This Toner For Over 5 Years & I Have Loved It. Its The Only Toner I Go Back To Because In Its First Use You Can See The Dirt That Is Removed From Your Face & In Every Use. You Can Visually & Physically Feel/Tell The Difference When Using This Product. I Like To Add Some Into A Spray Bottle & Then Remove Excess With A Cotton Pad. This Also Helped Me Years Back When I Was Having A Long Going Acne Breakout. I Have Not Had Any Problems With This Product & Will Continue Using. * I did not find this product to be soothing. Instead of reducing redness it seemed to make my skin more red. It left my skin feeling sticky instead of moisturized. My skin is a little sensitive, but i dont usually have to stop using products without finishing them. * I have mild rosacea. I am not consistent in my skincare routine, I will get some surface acne.   I implemented it into my current routine and used it consistently for 3 months. After about 6 weeks, I tried some variations to ensure that there wasn't interaction with what I was using. It did not exacerbate redness or irritate; however it also, did nothing else. The earthy smell dissipates as it dries. Nothing changed  I would not waste my money in the future on this particular product. * I have rosacea and this product helps to soothe redness and prevent further reactivity. It feels good on the skin and smells great. * Its so expensive, i wish it wasnt worth it. But it is! This makes my dry, sensitive skin so smooth and hydrated. 10/10."
281,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial advanced repair barrier cream,pimprod2036682,2603779," * Pricey for the small amount you get but it definitely feels amazing and a little goes a long way!! * This product has helped save my skin! Wearing the mask during Covid killed my skin barrier and I have not been able to revive it. Every product I have tryed has given me cystic acne or i have had a horrible reaction to it. And just when I thought all hope was lost this 💎 was recommended to me. I was a little weary as its a cream and feels like a balm. I am oily to combo and anything thick just make we more oily. This absorbs great as long as you dont over use it so find your sweet spot. Start out with a little cuz it goes a long way. This helps Hydrate my skin while I useing active to clear it up my breakouts. * While it does feel nice initially when you put it on that fades quickly and just makes my face feel tight. Absolutely not worth the price point. There are more hydrating options out there. * I have dry, sensitive skin & this cream has been a game changer for my skin. I love that this balm doesn't have shea butter like most balms because i suffer from acne & cannot use that ingredient on skin. This cream has cleared my acne (i assume because it has salicylic acid) & my skin just looks & feels so much healthier. I love it so much, but like someone else said in the comments…I wish they made a bigger size because i go through this stuff so quick since i use it day & night. * I have extremely dry skin. It's very sensitve and reactive due to an autoimmune disease. I can use hardly anything on my face. I use and like the Kiehl's cica but thought this would be better with the colder temps now. It's not. Skin is dryer and I can tell my skin barrier is unhappy now. It reminds me of using body lotion on your face (which I've tried a few times) it leaves a chalky matte finish too. Not good for my middle aged skin. 
Their Cica cream is far superior and so is anything by Ursa Major for all you out there with unhappy dry skin. This doesnt cut it as a facial lotion. * This is vry healing on my dry skin. It gave me a couple of whiteheads on my face, but I noticed that it really calmed the redness. It's a trade-off. I would rather cover a pimple with a little makeup rather than cover up the redness all over my face. * It's fine. It didnt do much for my chronically dry skin. My face actually looked a little worse the next day. However, my neck and upper chest were improved after one use. It's now my neck/chest cream and i'll stick to an oil on my face."

My 33 year old skin looks phenomenal! It's so moisturizing and soft on my skin with a beautiful glow. * Easily the BEST anti-aging deeply hydrating moisturizer I've ever used!!!! I've not only purchased the entire live for myself but family members and it's worth every penny. A LITTLE goes a long way! * The best face cream I have ever used. * This face cream was so expensive and I felt it didn't work for me. It made my face very sensitive and my foundation didn't stay well on top it. I was disappointed but will try something new. * I am loving the results of these products. * I've tried MANY MANY moisturizers. this one is THE BEST hands down! Use it day 1 and your face feels like a babys butt the very next day. That's how fast and amazing this stuff works. Nothing will make your skins feel this soft and supple. And no breakouts! (a few moisturizers make me break out for some reason but not this) The only downside is the price; it's horrendously expensive so I hafta wait until my bday & xmas gift cards and rewards points to buy it so I only buy it about once a year. A little goes along way so I can make it last a few months. I'm 56 with normal to dry skin. * I have used it for a week now. Like the way my skin feels I use it at night. Packaging is a little over the top. Contents is a lot smaller than it appears from the outside.

I love it * This stuff is gold! I have dehydrated reactive acne prone skin and this stuff does it all for me. Deeply moisturizes my skin without feeling greasy, absorbs quickly but lasts all day, doesn't disrupt my skin, AND is the best primer ever. My tinted serum lays flawlessly on my skin and doesnt get shiny throughout the day. Never going back to any other moisturizer."

I wanted to try something new and saw good reviews for this product so I gave it a try and truly wish I hadn't. This moisturizer is heavy and sticky. It leaves my skin feeling…. just gross. It made my skin break out in these weird tiny bumps and caused an acne flare up. I would not recommend this product. * this is a very nice moisturizer BUT it pills horribly. it messes up the makeup i put on top of it everytime. no matter how much i rubbed it in. will be returned. * Melts onto my skin. Doesn't feel heavy * As someone who struggles with rosacea, its hard to find skincare I like. This moisturizes, calms, and makes my skin feel soft and supple without making it feel greasy. It's definitely a new favorite!"

Oml getting it in store almost all of them had someones fingers dug in it :( but I found one that was good. Anyways my skin is combo, dry on the cheeks, oily in the tzone. There's a slight smell to it nothing overpowering. I didn't get a tingly feelings. The product is very light weight. Only needed a small dab to cover my whole face. It does fell kind of like the elf tone adjusting primer just not as greasy. My foudnation glided on real easily. I do think my skin does look good so far :) Very mich recommened for those with dry skin * Was just in Ulta looking around and saw this new item from NYX. Decided to try it and I am so happy I did. This primer is so good and is gripping like Milk. This product is long lasting and keeps the shine away. It has a tingling sensation when applying and I Love that ! NYX is really upping their game and I believe, they are doing a great job. Thanks for a good product for less cost. * this product sucks oily rat in sewer * Finally a primer that does not make my face breakout!!! 
Love! Love! Love!! * Did not like * I do not have sensitive skin but when i applied on my face it feel more like a burning sensation than a cooling effect . I really wanted to love this product but after a couple of times of using this it made me breakout bad . My skin is usually clear but it broke me out on the spots I applied. If you apply to much it can also cause flaking and ruin your makeup . * Sorry but 5 STARS is not enough, I am giving 5 MILLION STARS for my rating on this. WOW ,I CAN'T live without this either,  and do like they say, put it on the REFRIGERATOR  especially if you are like me with these crazy HOT FLASHES AND NIGHT SWEATS , this will save your life !!!!!"

It absorbs pretty quickly and you won't feel oily as the day goes on. No eye irritation. It does reflect the sun light away from your skin. * 100% my favorite ever. Yuka has it wrong I looked up the ingredients myself and this one is my favorite. * Horrible product it gave me a rash. Supper greasy and leaves a white cast. Waist of money * Once I put it on it had a white cast and it turned purple on me … never EVER again. * Purchased on advice of sales associate. Very happy with sun protection. A little goes a long way. * I have been using Juice products for about a week now and my skin looks younger. I am pleased and I love the glow moisturizer.  It really does give me a glow.  I cant wait to try the rest of the Juice beaty line! Thanks for keeping it organic. * I really like this combo moisturizer by Juice Beauty. I've been trying to 'multitask' my products to minimize the layers I put on my face everyday. This moisturizer dries to a sheer glow and doesn't remain too tacky. It doesn't pile under makeup and the fragrance is super light. Will buy again!
292,chanel,nÂ°1 de chanel revitalizing cream,pimprod2029886,2589593," * Best moisturizer I've used and I've used many.  A little goes a long way. * Ive been using this product for about a year now (i think) maybe a few months less than that.. I do like it, I can feel how it seems to be tightening my skin.. But, i havent noticed any difference. I have noticed at the very top where my hair line is, it gets super dry. I am not sure if it is the moisturizer or what but i have tried several different shampoos and conditioners and still have the problem. But i havent tried a different moisturizer yet. The smell does not bother me, it does smell good. I do feel like it isn't as moisturizing as it should be though… I really wish I could find the old Chanel Hydra Micro Creme! 

Honestly, I believe this moisturizer just depends on your skin type. I use it with my Chanel foundation.. I am still iffy about it because I feel like it also shows my ""fine lines"" more but I am not very good with all of this anyway. Lol * I unfortunately have sensitive skin, I find the fragrance to be irritating on me. Plus I have a bit of a break out coming in from hormones. I've been trying it for a while, I really wanted to love it. * Best product ever. * The No 1 Chanel line is phenomenal. I have 3 products now and will continue to add more. This is just what my ""mature"" skin needed. 
Thank you Katarina…Chanel and Ulta are lucky to have such a professional, knowledgeable and kind associate! * I got this as a sample and I immediately bought it once it ran out. I live in the desert so my skin gets really dry with the weather here, this moisturizer has been the only thing that's been able to hydrate my skin without leaving it greasy and my pores look like they're getting smaller. I'm pretty selective when it comes to spending money but this was well worth it. * I tried this in the store on the back of my hand and could instantly visibly see a difference in my skin texture. I am NOT a $115.00 facial cream buying type of woman but the next month I just had to have it and never felt a bit of guilt on this splurge."

However, this makes me feel like my skin is burning when I put it on. it's not too moisturing either. * Have used GLAMGLO and it is no longer available. So, I did some research and started to use ELEMIS. I guess it's ok except for the bottle it comes in, terrible. Very hard to come out, I ended up cutting it open and put the contents in a jar. Advice, change the container * I got a sample from ipsy— ordinarily I would not go for shimmery products but this gives such a healthy, natural glow on mornings that i dont have time to slap on layers of serum. It rules! * This product gives your skin a natural looking glow without looking fake. * i personally don't use it as a standalone moisturizer. i mix half with my lotion and it still provides a good glow that is almost overwhelming,but not. i love it and will always keep 
it on the counter * I had received a sample of this. It sat with my other samples for awhile, and one day I tried it. From that day on I was hooked! Put on after cleansing, serum, moisturizing, and spf. It makes a great primer before makeup, or you can use it for no makeup days as a beautiful finish that leaves bare skin glowing. I bought the full size after I ran out. Definitely worth the cost!! Love this! * I got a sample from a advant calendar around Christmas and became obessed. I love this. It looks so good alone. I can throw this on and some mascara and im out the door"

The dispenser is also great for avoiding contamination and spoilage of product. I also use it on the backs of my hands to hopefully discourage age spots down the road. * I do not have 'sensitive skin' type and yet this severly dried out my skin and it felt painful like a sunburn. I gave it a few tries I thought my skin was drying out because of the cooler weather but nope, this was the culprit! I cannot even fathom paying full price for this product. * I dont like the scent. It smells good when you're putting it on, but then it makes your pillow smell like wet dog. This dried out my face horribly and created big dry patches under my eyes and above my eyelids. I have to return it. * My skin is extremely sensitive to new products, especially retinols. This took a few weeks to get used to, but I'm now using it almost every night. My skin has SO much more life to it! * I recently switched my skincare line from Lancôme to Kate Somerville and let me just say that my face hasn't looked or felt this good in years. I have seen more results in only a few short weeks than I ever did with Lancôme. AND this line is less expensive. It's a win win! * For the first two weeks, everything was fine. Last night, I put it on and it literally burnt the skin off around my eyes. I love the smell and feel of it, but I please be careful if you aren't used to using retinol. Avoid adding near your eyes or mouth * Texture-creamy yet light weight 
Smell- think of a orange creamsicle

It's like the perfect blend of hydration and sun protection. It's super lightweight, so it doesn't feel greasy or heavy, and it does a great job at smoothing out my skin. I know it's a bit pricier than some other options, but it's totally worth it. Basically, if you're looking for a good moisturizer that'll keep your skin happy and healthy, this is it. * I love my travel sized moisturizer because I've been noticing some slight changes to the complexion of my skin. I have been targeting some fine lines I've been getting around my mouth area and neck because I'm a year away from 30. I wish the SPF was a tad lower but I like that there's SPF in it. It's a good product to have and I'm glad I was gifted by dermalogica. * Gifted by Estée Lauder , Loved the product, it was lightweight and perfect for my night time routine. It worked perfect on my sensitive skin, I will continue to incorporate it into my everyday routine. It was not overly fragranced and blended nicely. * I try to find products that already have SPF included so having this available in travel size is not just convenient, but also a great product. It's moisturizing without being heavy so it's great for daytime wear. Its great as a base before applying foundation.  Gifted by dermoligica. * Dermalogica's Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF 50 has become my go-to daily moisturizer. From the first application, I loved how it felt on my skin—lightweight yet deeply hydrating. It blends seamlessly and leaves my skin feeling firm and smooth, making it a perfect base for makeup. I've also noticed a brighter complexion and improved elasticity over time. Plus, the broad-spectrum SPF 50 gives me peace of mind knowing my skin is well-protected. * This moisturizer is very hydrating and perfect for someone like me who often forgets to apply sunscreen 
before leaving home. Its milky, lightweight texture absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't leave any white cast. It's perfect for layering under makeup without feeling greasy or heavy. The dual-action formula hydrates the skin while providing sun protection from uv rays. Gifted by Dermalogica! * Very hydrating with not a strong scent. The travel size is perfect for tossing in a daily bag, and reapplying when the spf has worn off or washed off. My skin didn't get burned in the sun, so the spf50 seems to work well! Something I will definitely repurchase. Gifted by detmalogica"

I'm a skincare junkie and I try new moisturizers all the time, but I always come back to this. The texture is PERFECT. It's a lightweight gel-cream but still as deeply moisturizing as a rich cream. A lot of gel creams dry down to nothing after an hour or two but this stays a lonnnng time. I literally use it like a nighttime rich cream, that's how nourishing it is. I tried the new vitamin c cream from Olehenriksen but its not as good as this OG one. May they never ever discontinue or reformulate! * My skin never looked better since using this entire line * you have no idea how many moisturizers I tried in my life and this became in my top 3. omg the glow I get with this is unreal. i get so many compliments from people about my skin when I use it. it doesn't break me out, it actually helped me clear my skin ! i will buy this again and again and I hope they will not change the formula! * I went on a trip and only brought this moisturizer for face and body. I got a little sunburn and used this and the burn went away over night with no peeling. I will forever use this as my after sun lotion. Highly recommend. * After using this product once I woke up the next morning with severe redness and achne-like bumps over my entire face!! I wanted to itch my face off it was so bad. Once I removed the product my face started to calm down. My skin is never sensitive like this, but it did NOT like this product what-so-ever!! * I wouldn't say that I am a fan of any skincare product, I hope they just do their job. Nothing has floored me like this skincare line. I bought this moisturizer because I bought the eye cream a couple weeks ago and LOVED IT. I can actually feel these products working on my skin. I've been blessed with normal skin and I can actually feel the benefits of this product. I feel moisturized and my skin feels ""alive"". I would highly recommend. * Big fan of Ole Henriksen products. I've tried them all and while its hard to choose a favorite, this is my go-to. It smells great (like a fresh orange) and feels even better. My skin just looks younger and better."

This lotion promises a lot—gentle exfoliation, brightening effects, and hydration—all while being safe for sensitive and acne-prone skin. 

By the end of the week, my skin looked more even-toned, and some of my dark spots had started to fade. The gentle exfoliation from the lactic acid helped in renewing my skin without causing any irritation or redness—a common issue I face with more aggressive exfoliants. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid exceeded my expectations! This dynamic blend of lactic acid and vitamin C not only brightens my complexion but also gently exfoliates. My skin feels smoother and looks more radiant. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula makes it ideal for use under makeup. This lotion has swiftly become one of my top choices for achieving a glowing, healthy appearance. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C is perfect for my normal to dry skin. It also brightens and evens out my skin. I love to apply it when my legs are out for a natural glow! * Looking for bright and radiant skin? Look no further! The lightweight moisturizing lotion contains 7% lactic acid for gentle exfoliation and Vitamin C for skin that will look glowy and fresh! My skin looks smoother and softer after just a few days! * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid is a staple especially for the Summer. I'm always on the hunt for some sort of vitamin c lotion. Since we have hard water that can be so tedious. Not only does it help repair my skin but I also get to brighten my skin at the same time. * I'm a big fan of the AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid AHA! This product truly brings out the radiance in my skin with its brightening formula that gives me a nice glow. I already own a few AmLactin products, but this one stands out to me because of its amazing scent – a lovely hint of cocoa that I adore. I believe this ingredient plays a part in maintaining the health and glow of my skin. I've noticed that the Vitamin C in this lotion is really working on evening out my skin tone and keeping it super smooth! * This product has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine, especially because my skin needs extra moisture when I'm constantly in the sun in the summer. I love that this product absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue! Highly recommend"

This one is not for me but Olay doesn't make it easy to know which one of their products to use. * I purchased this moisturizer from Ulta and it arrived within a few days. I use the product both morning and evening even if I am supposed to only use it once a day. My skin appears brighter and it is definitely smoother. I even use it on my neck but so far I haven't noticed a difference there. * This smooths my face and doesn't cause breakouts which so many moisturizers do. I haven't found a moisturizer yet that doesn't break me out. It lasts all day and works well underneath your makeup or by itself. I definitely plan on continuing to use this. * A couple months back I went on vacation to the Bahamas where my skin ended up breaking out very badly.  I brought this moisturizer with. It felt like my face was burning off and every time I took a shower more skin peeled off my face. It was the most miserable time ever. I assumed it had something to do with the trip. A couple days ago I tried this product again, the next morning the same thing happened, immediately this time. My face is burning, feels hot to the touch, bright red and is breaking out with little bumps all over and starting to do that gross oozy thing again. Now I realize it's this moisturizer. It might be awesome on some, just not me. I really wanted to like this product but I wouldn't wish this horrible reaction on anybody. So I guess just be cautious and if you notice something doesn't feel right, stop using it immediately. * This stuff isnt just great for your face, but can work on other sensitive areas too. I had dark marks/hyperpigmentation left behind from a medical adhesive left on my thigh too long, and this genuinely helped to fade those lines to a point where they are less noticeable * I love the way this smells. I use it in the mornings, a little hint of citrus smell is nice to give you a little wake up. Goes on a little sticky, but drys smooth and soft. Definitely recommend. * I've been a licensed esthetician for over 5 years and also an Ulta employee. I got this as a gift for the holidays and had no interest in trying it. I'm such a skincare snob. Well, I tried it. I absolutely love this moisturizer. I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear it because I'm glowing."

I will definitely buy it again!! * I have acne rosacea along with endometriosis, so my skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and breakouts so easily. I have tried every moisturizer from the drugstore to my dermatologist prescriptions, and nothing, I mean nothing has compared to this. this has not made my face itch, burn, or breakout. it actually took away about 90% of my redness in the first 24 hours i used it. i never thought Chanel would be my life line, but its now my holy grail. if you are truly sensitive, and not just ""sensitive"" like the majority of women say and they use like Cerave on their skin, but seriously have sensitive skin, try this out. you wont be disappointed. id rather pay more for quality ingredients than anything from a drugstore. * I have been a hardcore Charlotte Tillbury Magic Cream fan. I started using tretonin so it was suggested I use this moisturizer before and after applying the tretonin. I absolutely love it. It's extremely moisturizing and smells amazing. My face is very dry but after using this it feel so soft and smooth. It's kind of small for the price but I love it so much I will suck it up. * I wanted to love this item but I used it once and the second day, the pump stopped working.   I tried to pump many times but no product was coming out.   It was definitely a splurge but for the price it's not worth it.   Maybe change the packaging??? * I love the results of this product but I'm allergic to the fragrance. I was sneezing, runny nose, etc. Why does everyone who make such lovely lotions have to ruin it with fragrances? * My skin looks so healthy radiant and feels soft to the touch!"

However, this is one of the absolute best and most luxurious face creams I've ever used, and at a desirable price point. It leaves my cracked, painful and psoriasis-prone face plump, dewy, glowy and hydrated for the entire day or night. It performs better than the majority of my high end brand creams do and is extremely gentle. Highly recommend trying. * It moisturizes my skin too much! It looks great under makeup, you wake up as if you had just washed your face, I love it! Super moisturizing. * I am of the darker persuasion in her late 30s and it is hard to find a moisturizer that does not over power you with the smell. But this, this one is lovely. It goes on like butter ladies. Trust me it blends well with other products too. * This cream smells like the airplane cabin bathroom pink hand soap, which is slightly offputting. It also feels thick and heavy without seeming to sufficiently moisturize my face, so I think this formula just isn't for me."
303,cetaphil,healthy renew purified peptides broad spectrum spf 30 day cream,pimprod2041297,2611322," * This absorbs nicely and I think it's working. * Feels heavy and uncomfortable.Definitely not suitable for acne prone/oily skin.If you have dry skin this is for you. It leaves a beautiful glow and deeply hydrates but again, not for oily skin or if you leave in hot weather.Too heavy for a day cream * I got this product with high hopes. It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy.

All around my face and under chin. My money just went to waste. SO DISAPPOINTED * It really makes my skin look like glass! Would love to try the mist also * As other reviewers said it causes little white pumps on my t zone area and it doesn't do anything. * This product is very moisturizing I have been using this for 2 weeks and it's amazing * not a bad moisturizer but not the greatest either. its great for warmer weather since its lightweight and doesnt make your skin greasy. the moisture doesnt last all day through the colder weather though. * not a bad moisturizer but not the greatest either. its great for warmer weather since its lightweight and doesnt make your skin greasy. the moisture doesnt last all day through the colder weather though. * I was looking for a hydrating moisturizer that would not leave my skin looking oily but I'm still seeing some dryness around my problem areas

I'm not a fan of the aluminum tube it comes in but that's not a deal breaker for me. Run to buy this! * This PM Hydration to rebuild and protect your bodies best defense, your skin barrier is incredible! I have very sensitive skin and so many issues with my skin from aging, etc and  this night cream is the answer. My spouse Loves it and uses it too! * Great price point, and appealing ingredients for my skin type. I don't know why, but it seems to sap water out of my skin. Long term use gave me dryness and temporary wrinkles. It might be due to my climate. * So moisturizing and i have noticed a huge difference in my skin when i wake up, softer and clearer. I have oily acne prone skin and I've experienced no breakouts or excess oil during the day. * I got this whole line on a whim and i can definitely say its healed my skin barrier and got rid of my acne. This stuff goes on smooth and feels so good on my face, i wake up very refreshed, the spf in the morning version is a plus. Thank you ROC🧡😁 * I've been struggling with adult acne for about 2 years now. One of the things I've learned is if your skin barrier is shot - you're not going to heal your acne. This product has significantly improved my skin for the better. It truly does what it says: improves skin barrier. It also will help heal a breakout literally overnight which is amazing! * Been using it at night after my HA application and waking up with silky soft skin with faded blemish appearance. Will buy again."

I haven't used it long enough to notice if it helps with wrinkles but I will let you know later. Some moisturizers feel sticky when you put it on, this one does not. It also has a nice smell to it. * I have been using this Hydrating cream for over one year now. I like how it works and how it makes my skin feel. * found this product on sale and thought I would give it a try, and so far, I really like it - feels nice and haven't had any bad reactions, nice find * Wow! I was blown away by how effective this max hydration cream by ROC is! When you first apply this you can feel it deeply hydrating your skin. It's fast absorbing and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. After about a week of use i started to notice a slight reduction of my visible fine lines and wrinkles. After about 3 weeks to a month of use I have much firmer skin. This cream is amazing! 
Contains Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol for maximum results. Dermatologist tested. Paraben free. Non comedogenic. Non irritating and fragrance free. 
I received this product free from Roc & PinchMe. * So gar I'm enjoying the  line smoothing max hydration cream. It's a bit thicker than I anticipated but it's creamy enough the it goes on smooth. After just a few days I noticed how hydrated my skin feels. I can't wait to see what the future holds in continuing this product.  Because I sure need it. Retinol these lines honey.. retinol these lines lol. Thanks ulta * ١like the effectiveness, moisturizing, and skin softness of the product. They mention it works well, leaves their faces feeling hydrated, and is the absolute best moisturizer they have ever tried. Some appreciate wrinkle reduction and the skin look. However,I have reported that the product can irritate sensitive skin and burn their eyes. Opinions are mixed on the scent and value for money. * Love the feel of my skin after putting this on. It's feel so soft."

Im normal to oily. * This is a thing that I searched for very light weight non sticky and effective * Put this moisturizer on and had to take it off within minutes bc the smell was giving me a headache. I dont Understand why skincare companies think they need to add such strong fragrance to their products. Will be returning this product. * I started using this about a month ago and I love it! So this will now be two of their skincare products I really like and does the job. And again, affordable! I use it in my morning routine and feels great! Goes on smooth and light weight. I would recommend! * I just bought this came home put it on and instantly got a headache from the strong perfume smell. It's like they dumped a whole bottle of floral old lady perfume in this moisturizer. I looked at the ingredients and it actually says perfume and that shouldn't be in a face moisturizer. Returning this immediately * I used it for the first time a month ago … my skin is glowing    It looks firmer and I definitely will buy again * I dont know what it is about this product but even if it is the onky thing I wear that day it atill peels and clumps on my skin after it dries. Nit a fan."
312,fresh,rose & hyaluronic acid lightweight moisturizer,pimprod2038854,2608278," * There's something about this that just feels a little luxurious. I purchased this on a black Friday sale otherwise I don't think I would've spent the money. Now that I've used it I will definitely repurchase in the future, even at the regular cost because I think it is worth it. I have oily skin and most moisturizers leave my skin oily because they are just too thick and creamy. This moisturizer is very thin and watery and glides on your face very smoothly and doesn't leave me feeling oily. I'm also a big fan of the rose smell. * this product is incredible!so glowy and hydrating!! also feels so luxurious! * I love that it's not greasy. I have acne prone skin and it doesn't make me break out. * Love this moisturizer! Definitely hydrating and it smells divine * I love how this product gave me so much moisture that i needed i used it both morning and night i love the smell and it does what it says it supposed to do. * I wanted this to be my spring/summer lotion, and while it felt nice and light and I was initially happy, I'm pretty sure it's making my older (late 40s) combo skin break out. * This lightweight moisturizer is amazing for summer, or winter when paired with a slightly heavier one. Great for milia!! Mine is starting to go away."
313,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial moisturizer spf 30,pimprod2002927,2536697," * A great product. * This may be a decent moisturizer for winter or indoor not sweating use. Do not use for outdoor activities. It will burn your eyes SO badly. I don't have sensitive eyes or skin but I was practically blind on a summer hike. Horrible! I expect more from a brand like this. * I do have to say I only just tried this product so I'm unsure if it will break me out in the future. However it feels lovely on my skin. Before I applied this product I had some slight dry patches on my skin and it noticeably reduced the dryness. It didn't leave any white cast on my skin (I do have very fair skin though) and it made my skin looks very dewy and glowing! I would definitely recommend this product :) * I really do not understand the bad reviews. This is a great moisturizer with SPF in it. I personally like an all in one product and with 4.2 ounces you get a good value for your money. Not only does this have great ingredients, it is hydrating, sinks into your skin very easily, doesn't leave a white cast, and does not make your eyes burn. My skin glows after applying and it also wears SO well under makeup!! I do not find this sunscreen to be greasy at all. It actually makes me less oily throughout the day compared to the other SPF moisturizer I was using previously. I was using the Cerave AM lotion but wasn't in love with it as it took a lot of TLC to blend in and made my makeup pill. I was recommended this product by a friend and I am so glad I bought this. For those concerned about fragrance I notice a very very slight sunscreen smell but it doesn't bother me and I am someone who is sensitive to scents. This is a chemical sunscreen so some people may be sensitive to that. I am someone who isn't. I prefer chemical sunscreens anyway because they usually do not leave a white cast and are more hydrating. Mineral sunscreens are always too drying for my skin and leave too much of a whitecast. * I love this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I just love how it applies and how moisturized my skin feels afterwards. * It's ok. Def more of a sunscreen feel. Doesn't leave a white cast but takes a while to soak in. I have to wait quite awhile before I can begin applying my makeup. Like a lot of Kiehl's products but won't buy this one again. * I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now and I swear by it. I put it on in the morning before applying my makeup and it works perfectly. I've found that some moisturizers make my foundation look kinda wonky, but my makeup goes on top of this one nicely. Also, I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this product. I'm never going back!"
314,cetaphil,hydrating moisturizing cream body moisturizer,pimprod2028655,2586929," * Love how it makes my skin soft . & helps my old skin with age spots & bruising * my sensitive skin gets dry over time and this helps it a lot. I am 10 years old and I live in Florida so this is a must-have * This product received the National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance, as listed on the NEA website. I passed over this product for years because the package does not include the seal. I was absolutely missing out. This jar cream is the best body moisturizer I have ever used on my eczema, dermatographia, contact dermatitis, and other skin disorders. It has absolutely helped my skin heal from flare ups as well as help prevent new ones. I do not use this on my face so I cannot speak to its effect on acne. It's comforting and relieving to know I have finally found something to mitigate the suffering. No more intense burning pain just from water or scratching until the skin is raw. This is not a beauty product to me, it's a medical necessity helping my quality of life. Be patient and give this a try, your skin will get better. * Im currently using this moisturizer along with a 10% Benzoyl peroxide cleanser and its the best. My skin type is dry but acne prone fyi. This moisturizer can be used for the face and body and my skin does not feel dry or tight, Simply moisturized. * I use to moisturize my face in the morning and night. I definitely recommend! * So im new to skincare. I was having a bad breakout. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin. Ever ""sensitive skin moisturizer"" straight up burns my face. This moisturizer has never hurt my face. I use this as my night time moisturizer. In only a week i have seen great changes to my face. It feels super smooth. And dont quote me on this, but i BELIEVE this product has niacinamide in it. The niacinamide cleared my redness. I highly reccomend if you are stumped on a moisturizer for sensitive skin. * My skin is dry and that makes it quite sensitive. But this lotion and shower gel does not irritate my skin and certainly helps it feel better."
315,la roche-posay,pure vitamin c anti-wrinkle firming moisturizing filler,pimprod2019700,2574392," * Not too greasy, perfect for combination skin. Helped minimize fine lines after minths of use . * Although I enjoy the smell, the bottle is manufactured so terribly that even the lightest pressure expels the cream outside and under the lid. It is already half way gone with only using it a half full of times because the lid does not lock and stay in place! Highly disappointed. * I need C10 now! * Vitamin C does wonders for your skin. I use this for daytime care in conjunction with the Redermic R in the evening. It's a great combo ! * I use Redermic C every morning as my moisturizer.  I put it on, let it stay on a few minutes to absorb, and then apply my foundation and other makeup. * I use for 1 year and my skin now looks better, my Dermatologist recommended it 👌🏼 * I used to use Dr Perricone products which are great but pricey so I read about the LaRoche line and some have gotten rewards from New Beauty Magazine. I gave it a try and I am very happy with the results ! I use Redermic R every other night and the Redermic C everyday in the morning. My skin looks and feels the same as when I used Perricone products. It consistently delivers."

The idea that it helps to brighten the skin without Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) won me over. I find Vitamin C can be too aggressive on my skin. * I love this moisturizer! Its my favorite to use day in and day out. It has an extremely soft, lightweight texture so its great for daily, but also has so many brightening, moisturizing, and mild resurfacing properties, its also great for my evening regimen as well. Ive noticed a lot of my dark spots evening out, and my skins surface looking more ""glass"" like. The Vitamin C & Beautyberry in this work together so well to be brightening & moisturizing. This is definitely one of my HOLY GRAILS!! * I seen a significant difference in my dark spots with this product! * This cream is amazing! It even tone my skin and took care of the dark spots. I've been it regularly, and I love the feeling of smooth and find lines! * Love how my skin looks more even * I do not have sensitive skin and this product made me break out. I'm 56 and never had acne issues. I do not recommend this"
318,belif,aqua bomb brightening vitamin c cream,pimprod2043263,2619878," * A refreshing smell and feel on my skin. Perfect under foundation. * I had tried a sample of a belif moisturizer and was satisfied with it so when I saw this on sale I jumped on it. Some people complain about the scent but I really enjoy it. Kind of reminds me of fruity pebbles and makes me smile. A little bit goes a long way and works great for my combination skin. * I think this is best moisturizer I've ever used and can't believe how great it makes my skin feel. I have only used it so far in the dead of winter and it makes me feel completely moisturized, like I just left a facial. I also have rosacea and sensitive skin and this hasn't bothered me at all. The lemon-y smell is so amazing I kind of wish I had a body lotion that smelled like this too! * I'm regular customer. * This cream is awesome. My skin has a beautiful glow now. * ive tried many different moisturizers and i also love the belif ones, but this one is absolutely amazing. my skin has never felt so hydrated and it stays glowy all day long! i definitely notice my skin has been
 brighter since using. the price doesnt matter when its this good of a product . no pilling and doesn't leave me looking greasy either. will repurchase when i run out, but a little goes a long way! * Serum meets lotion in this age-defying product! I had been using VitC serum in the morning and a night-time cream before bed and during the Beauty Steals event, I discovered this! I'm hooked! It's a bit high-priced, but that's the only con. I'll use a coupon and some rewards points and purchase more soon. It's great! It has a lemony scent and goes on very smoothly. A little goes a long way. It absorbs quickly and evens out my complexion. It's not greasy, leaves a nice vibrancy and I'm already seeing a difference after a week! Impressive!"

It's almost like the product went off or dried in the tube and the dried out parts mixed back in. You can visibly see the particles in there * I have oily skin. I JUST bought this today and it has a thick consistency, and it smells like nothing. Maybe a little tiny bit like chemicals. But it also has a white cast, so if youre a person of color i wouldn't recommend this. * this product sucks. I've tried it a number of times and every time it pills up. it flakes off my face and makes it impossible to do makeup on top because it flakes off so much. do not buy! * Although it does provide oil control and has little to no white cast, it's very thick and isn't ""lightweight "". Very thick and makes it hard to distrubuted across the face without roughly dragging it on your face. * Its not light weight and it feels like a sunscreen and not a moisturizer. Its really heavy and leaves a cast. IMO its not melanin friendly i had to wash it off in order to not walk around looking like a ghost. * Not a ""lightweight daily moisturizer"" at all. More like a thick sunscreen. Didnt have any bad reactions with it but it was difficult to rub in consistently and dried really quick. Does help with oil control though. Probably wont repurchase. * I love it. I use as primer and spf. the less product under my makeup the better. set with powder."
