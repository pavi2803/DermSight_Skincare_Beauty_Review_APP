0,clinique,moisture surge 100h auto-replenishing hydrator moisturizer,pimprod2021615,2576544," * I LOVE this product. I dont know what I would do without her!! I am 21 years old, I have skin that is easily allergic to a lot of products, and have rosacea. I also get extremely dry skin year round that cracks and starts to burn. I have tried lathering myself in aquaphor and many different moisturizers but nothing works like this product. I put her on and she is ready to put makeup over in less than 3 minutes, and she doesn't cause my makeup to pill, which I love because both this moisturizer and my bb cream are water based. On my no makeup days, I only need to apply her once in the morning, and in the past I would need to reapply moisturizers almost 3 times a day. Like I mentioned above, I struggle with redness in the cheek area from rosacea and have noticed that going down signifigantly since I started using this product. It is so calming, hydrating, easy to use, and really lives up to its name. The only con is how expensive it is but it is definently worth it to claim any sales going on to give her a try! 
I don't know how my skin lived before this product!! * It's a nice gel moisturizer, but not as moisturizing as I need for a ""senior"". * I think it works and it doesn't clog the pores. I have combination skin that is prone to being oily, and the only other moisturizer that worked so far was from Purito brand. It is worth it if your skin isn't overly dry and if you're scared of breaking out. * On melanated skin often times moisturizers with spf leave a residue. This does not. Doesn't feel heavy on the skin. * Indoor heat has been a real threat to my skin. I knew i needed to change to something more creamy and absorbent. This was recommended to me and I'm so pleased with the results. It's not greasy, absorbs quickly, and helps my foundation stay fresh all day. You need ti try some tiday. You won't be sorry. * I was looking for a good moisturizer and this one was part of Ulta's January sale. It feels good on my skin and I'm
glad I purchased it. I will definitely buy again! * Hands down my favorite skin quenching moisturizer.  Lightweight but keeps my skin nice and hydrated without being oily."
1,bubble,over night hydrating sleep mask,pimprod2035928,2600876," * I have been loving it the first time I got it and when I wake up in the morning my skin is smooth and soft and feels hydrated even through the cold winter air🫧✨🤗❄️ * It didn't break me out so I'll give it one star, but it also did nothing for my face. Absolutely no moisturizing at all – pretty worthless. * I had really awful redness all over my face the next day morning after using this product. Maybe im allergenic to certain ingredient but I personally won't use it again. * I used it after using red light theraphy and really noticed a change in my skin. * I love bubble products and this left my skin glowing. It feels like silk going on. It lasts for SO long. * I was shocked by how luxurious this product feels. Its so hydrating and leaves a nice dewy glow. * This is a good product that has a wonderful water gel cream consistency which is my favorite type of moisturizer, but I was expecting this to be heavier which is the reason for the 4 star review."

3,philosophy,hope in a jar smooth-glow multi-tasking moisturizer spf 30,pimprod2037931,2605578," * I liked it very much. * If you are looking for a very good moisture this is the best one try. * After applying and allowing it to dry the eyecream peeled off my face. * I just started using this in the evening & it removes makeup & cleanses all in one step! No double cleanse needed! It leaves your skin soft & hydrated! * I wanted to love this product but it burns my eyes and peels horribly leaving a weird residue on my face * I have used the Philosophy facial cleanser for a long time and I love it. It cleans my face without drying it out. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is because the pump in the large size leaks. * I was in search of a new cleanser that would also remove my waterproof mascara - based on the reviews, I thought I'd try this one. While I like it as a regular cleanser, it didn't remove much of my waterproof mascara. I would recommend as a gentle cleanser but not for waterproof makeup remover."
4,drunk elephant,protini polypeptide firming moisturizer,pimprod2028061,2588434," * I was reluctant to buy drunk elephant at first because of the price. Curiosity won me over and i bought the travel set. 

I love this moisturizer! I have already restocked this in the fullsize! It is worth the price. My skin is hydrated, and clear! * I have used Protini Polypeptide for a couple of years and my skin is smoother and more lifted.  I have rosacea and this product is wonderful for sensitive skin! * Love this product. Noticed a difference in the hydration of my skin. My skin is definitely smoother. * I've gone through at least 5 regular containers and 2-3 minis in the last four years. It has become a go to product. It feels moisturizing even when I use strong cleansers, and I feel it improves the texture of my skin. * I have been using for over 5 years. I have tried a few other brands, but always come back to this one. I have senstive skin and this is one of the only mositruizers that has worked for me. 

My one complaint is with the refills. I have  had issues with fit and functioning of the original container. After replacing lotion, the dispenser stopped working. * I have been using this for a little over a month now. The PROS… It feels amazing on my skin. My skin feels silky, soft and it feels incredibly hydrated. It also wears very well underneath makeup. The CONS… it advertises that it helps with the appearance of skin tone, texture, and firmness. I have not noticed any difference in any of thsoe areas. CONCLUSION … if you're looking for a hydrating moisturizer that feels wonderful on your skin and works well with sensitive skin, this is a wonderful moisturizer for you. If you're looking for the benefits of improved tone, texture, and firmness, like it advertises, I would not recommend this moistureizer. * USE WITH CAUTION! 
I recently ordered a new one late October. For reference my last Protini was purchased July 2025.
I have no idea what happened but within hours of application my face became red, I woke up the next day and had small milia/whiteheads, all over my face and neck along with a lovely rash. Stopped using it immediately, reached out to the company to confirm any formula changes, to which they said there was none.
Returned the product but am still wondering what happened as I have been using this particular cream for years and never had an issue. 
If you plan to start using this cream or even get a new one, start using it when you have no important events coming up, just in case you have a reaction."
5,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial cream with squalane,pimprod2002804,2540233," * This formula is designed for a winter, non-humid environment. Its excellent for my winter skin, not for humid environs. I use pretty much every night from fall to spring and use lighter moisurizer in the humid months. I have mid 40s ""normal"" skin. This is my fav! So comforting. * I got this as a free sample when I purchased stuff as an online order. I tried it out for a couple of days and everytime it pilled on my skincare by-itself if i used too much. For an expensive skincare, I would think it wouldnt happen and having too apply it a certian way for it not to happen is ridiculous to me. * I have super dry skin and live in a dry climate. This is light weight and is great under makeup * I love it! My husband loves it! * This is worth the price and it has my skin feeling so moustuized the next day. I put a thick layer on before bed and my skin thanks me. * I am someone who loves to try different brands and products quite a bit. There are a few things I have consistently gone back to. This is one of those things. I have tried others and liked them, but this one is just perfect. The best, light weight consistency. Non greasy, does not make my skin oily. I use this nightly and wake up with soft, supple skin. I will never give this product up!! * As someone with dry skin this is my all time favorite face moisturizer. Gives enough moisture to let my skin feel hydrated all day without being greasy. I've lost track how many of these I've purchased over the years."

7,tula,24-7 weightless moisture day & night gel cream,pimprod2045112,2624255," * I've been using this for a couple of weeks now. It absorbs quite quickly, doesnt leave my skin feeling super oily and seems to last most of the day. Fairly decent price too compared to other brands. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review]

This day & night cream was a game changer! Doesn't leave behind that weird greasy residue that some moisturizer creams do or give that weird tacky feeling when it dries. Just pure softness. * I could not tell how well this product worked since I have sensitive skin & broke out using it. Tula has other great products that I use frequently, such as Glow & Get It Cooling Under Eye Balm, but this Gel Crème is not for me.  I will be returning it. * I recently started using the TULA 24-7 Weightless Day & Night Gel Cream and have been impressed with how light yet hydrating it feels on my skin. The gel texture absorbs quickly w * Loved this! I will definitely be repurchasing myself. After just going through winter my skin was so dry, this helped a bunch! It didn't irritate my skin and left it feeling moisturized. * I am a skincare junkie, and well, this one just worked well for my dry, mature, 50-year-old skin. I feel as we age, our skin changes anyway, but I never thought a gel would be better for my dry skin. This one is truly like water for my face. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The texture is very smooth and it's very cooling. I like that the moisturizer is very gentle. I really love tula packaging. I think it's so cute and there's not really a scent to it."
8,it cosmetics,confidence in a cream anti-aging hydrating moisturizer,pimprod2033684,2598796," * I had high hopes after reading reviews. But sadly it did not libe ip to the hype. It does not moisturize and was horrible under concealer. I had to wash it off and use my old under eye cream. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This cream worked a lit better than expected. It smooths my skin and leaves it with a nice matte finish. The cream is a little thick but is still easy to apply and absorba into the skin really quickly. It also keeps my face feeling moisturized all day. It also has a mild, citrus scent that smells really good. It's my new favorite moisturizer. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The cream feels a bit thick but blends nicely and feels hydrating. Good moisturizer and easy on the skin. Does not leave any residue and no breakouts. * I received this product for Christmas and was very excited to use it! I have tried to use it for about 2 weeks, thinking that my skin needed to get used to it, but it only got worse. My skin is itchy and dry, but also breaking out. Terrible! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I received the IT COSMETICS confidence in a cream anti aging hydrating moisturizer free in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion. I tested a small amount on my cheek and instantly got an allergic reaction. I guess my skin is alot more sensitive than I originally thought. That's why I didnt post a picture of myself using it. The scent was barely noticeable. If ypu dont have sensitive skin this is for you. * I received this product in exchange for my honest review. IT Cosmetics Confirdence in a Cream moisturizer really impressed me. It goes on super smooth, leaves skin soft and my skin looks amazing the next morning. There's a light soft scent and the texture feels so silky. I have acne prone skin and it didn't cause me to break out of cause irritation. Not sure about anti-aging yet but hopeful it'll prevent deep lines from forming due to hydration. * I am a huge fan of IT Cosmetics on all levels. People tell me I should work for the company because of my enthusiasm for the products. First, I'm 58 yrs old and people think I'm 38-40! I've even been carded at casino's. I attribute my youthful look to IT Cosmetics, especially this face cream. I had fine lines on each side of my mouth, after using this face cream for a week or so, they are gone. I had lines on my neck, 3 to be exact and now you can barely see them. I love the smell of this product. The texture is amazingly smooth and super soft. I use it twice a day, morning before putting on my IT Cosmetics makeup and and night after cleansing my face and before bed. I've never found another product that works so fast, I so effectively and with such amazing results. If you haven't tried this, please do! You will be pleasantly surprised by the end results."

10,the ordinary,natural moisturizing factors + ha daily moisturizer,pimprod2007113,2551163," * I struggle with texture, clogged pores, and black heads. The medication I use requires a 'no active ingredients' moisturizer. I thought i found it in this moisturizer, since they advertise as non-comedogenic. This formula actually contains Oleic Acid, which is a pore clogging ingredient. I didnt realize this and my texture and black heads were awful even with my medication. When I switched to a different moisturizer without clogging ingredients, the issue stopped immediately. I suggest that if you deal with texture or clogging pores, dont use this moisturizer. * My daughter loves this brand and everything about it !! * I used this product for a long time thinking that my acne was jsut bc i was a teen and my hormones were acting up but i did more resesrch recently on all my products and this was the only one that wasn't noncomedogenic.  I used this product for almost a year and had horrible acne the whole time now its been a few werks with out it and my skin has fully cleared up. I was very disappointed but i found an alternative (elf holy hydration moisturizer). * Sadly, after using this product for three years, I have just come to find that it is part of the Lauder brands, and I simply can't support this criminal operation * I buy this moisturizer a lot. It's great. 

Your free gift policy blows. If someone meets requirements, just send them their gift. And then your customer service wanted to argue with me about it. I am loyal, but I plan to shop elsewhere on principle. * I have been using it for a week now and my skin has noticeably improved in texture and tone. I have pretty dry skin, especially in the winter in the desert, and this has really saved my skin. I don't think people are rubbing it in properly or using way too much when complaining about a white cast or it feeling too greasy. I saw comments on pilling and I haven't experienced that. I have been layering this product with other serums some nights and also wearing makeup over it and the texture of my skin remains smooth. I also like that ordinary doesn't scent their products since I avoid putting fragrances on my skin as much as possible. I reapply it a few times a day because of how plump and hydrated it makes my skin feel. Will definitely buy again. * I've tried so many moisturizers this one is 
Definitely the best by far!"
11,bobbi brown,vitamin enriched face base moisturizer & primer with vitamin c + hyaluronic acid,pimprod2025028,2583728," * I was hesitant to purchase this product because of the price, but it was worth every penny. it feels sooo nice on the skin, even on my sensitive eczema prone skin. It also smells amazing and my makeup has never applied smoother. 10/10 will return for the largest size. * I really enjoy this creme. I love how it makes my skin feel and makes my makeup easier to apply. * Love this helps with my spots and with wrinkles when I apply makeup * I received this in a variety sample box and immediately assumed it would be pricey just from the scent. It's scent is aromatherapy-like, very clean and luxurious smelling. I've been using a dime-sized amount after a lightweight moisturizer and it goes on almost like a firm barrier that gives a rejuvenated look and feel to my skin and locks in my skincare products all day underneath my foundation. However, it doesn't supply its *own* hydrating effects to me, only holding whatever is there in. It's also not heavy which usually causes me random pimples. 4 stars for no added hydration benefits and high price for little product, but it does last you a while. Will be repurchasing since its on a bogo deal. * I do not care if my skincare has fragrance but wow...this is so overwhelming that I felt it needed to be mentioned and why I only gave it the 4 stars instead of the 5.  I do love the texture of the product and find that it works perfectly as a moisturizer and primer, but I find that I do not reach for it as often because of the strong scent. * I absolutely love it! It smells so fresh as well as creating the music needed hydration my skin needs 😩 * My makeup has never looked better! This works so well and feels nice on the skin. Highly recommend"

13,la roche-posay,cicaplast balm b5 soothing therapeutic multi purpose cream,pimprod2018263,2570171," * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I get chapped and rough hands a lot and this cream greatly helped soften them up and make them feel much better. The product seems to do exactly what the box says and I'm going to keep using it.  It's not too heavy and doesn't have any weird smells. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Truly a miracle in a bottle! The La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5+ Palm saves my hands in the cold winter months. It is an easy ointment-like and lotion texture, so it is very easy to blend and work into skin. It does not feel sticky or pastey afterwards. If you have sensitive, eczema-prone skin, this is great because it's also unscented! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] It repairs my skin very well. When my skin is very dry it absorbs all on my skin. Application is very nice and easy to do. It has a very good quantity. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I wanted to love it, I really did. My skin is awful, especially in the cold months - dry, cracked, wind chapped. This protectant felt great going on, kind of cooling, but the more I rubbed it in the worse it felt, almost like it was burning? It also will not rub in completely, I couldn't get it to lose the white sheen on my skin. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This multi-purpose cream is a game changer. It feels amazing on my skin and is perfect as my go to for daily mosturization. The scent is also very pleasant! I highly recommend to anyone dealing with dry skin. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I have been loving this for my son's diaper rashes and dry skin. During this winter season I have used this for chapped and dry skin. I have loved it and have been using it every single day. This is a must buy. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] My holy grail of all holy grails. My dry, winter broken skin barrier savior. Absorbs into the skin beautifully with no stickiness. Revives the skin overnight. One of my #1 skincare recommendations. Would repurchase again and again!"
14,dermalogica,dynamic skin recovery spf 50 moisturizer,pimprod2029957,2588996," * I've been using it for years. Its berry moisturizing. I love how it's not matte when it goes on, and it does absorb and leaves your skin soft and not greasy. * I've been using this product for around 10 years now. Obviously, it gets no complaints from me. * I love Dermalogica moisturizers. I got this initially as a sample. I was happy with how smoothly it went on and didn't leave an SPF scent. Purchased a couple on sale so I could have in my stash! * Yes I would purchase this spf over and over it does what it says ! * From using this regime my skin has been so much nicer * This product line is always so consistent and keeps my skin looking younger * Unfortunately this is least favorite product ive ever tried! The smell is very strong (old granny perfume), burned and irritated my eyes even though i was careful around that area, broke me out so bad it took months to recover and has a slight whitecast. The upside is that its a high spf and is really convenient to have a 2 in 1 product. Unfortunately I will never repurchase again unless its completely and totally reformulated"

This peptide cream has my skin looking the best it has in years: healthy, smooth, luminous & blemish-free. It's a definite repurchase & will be part of my essentials from now on, in spite of the price-point being higher than my usual moisturizer - it's that good! * I bought this product on a whim along with their mini protein exosome bioactive serum. I use both and noticed immediate plumpness and glow. My husband asked me within 3 days if I've been doing something different with my skin be are it's so glowy. I used to have extremely oily skin but now being mid 40's and in full menopause it's dry and dull and very finicky. I'm on my second jars of both. It plumps my skin so much and even my 11's look less noticeable. * I have pretty dry skin and I used this moisturizer in the mornings under SPF and makeup. Even on my driest days, it did amazing!

I felt this oiliness until I washed my face again. * I love this product, it was very hydrating for my dry skin..it has a nice clean scent and i wore it under my sunscreen and my skin looked and felt nice snd supple…I will by it again. * Really good cream for dry skin. It's light scent is pleasant and you don't need a lot. * I got this moisturizer as a bonus from Ulta and it felt really nice and hydrating. I have combinstion skin, but on days when my skin is drier I need a more moisturizing crram. So, this was perfect! The only downside is the strange smell, jt smells kind of like old oil, but i didnt mind because my sensitive skin cant take scented products anyway. Definitely a must try for dry skin! * I tried this moisturizer because it was a free gift for my birthday. Normally i would not try it because of the price and I have very sensitive skin that reacts to everything (but everyone is different). I have very dry skin as well as larger pores. This product dos not cause pilling. * I am 70 years old and this cream is perfect for my skin type. There is no heavy residue or feeling that you are wearing a face cream.

I even added other hydrating products, and it felt like this sucked all the life out of my skin. It may be much better for oily skin in the summer time, but definitely not dry skin in the winter. * I've purchased this many times. Its always a go to i enjoy using it as a primer as well since its tacky * As a 45-year-old individual with sensitive skin, I've found this face cream to be remarkably effective. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a new facial moisturizer. * I love this stuff! A little amount goes a long way! I love the way it makes my skin feel. So soft and the cream isn't heavy. I have a healthy glow to my skin after using this and the price point is perfect for the amount of product you get. Love it! * Didn't have a reaction, love the texture. A little goes a long way and its a good amount for the price. I was a little concerned when i firdt out it on as it seemed to be drying down kinda tightly rather than smoothly if that makes any sense, but I used it overnight and woke up with really hydrated skin the next morning so no complaints, just trust the process. Works great with my other skincare from Derma-E and Curology. * Do not like this product it made me break out and i have pretty normal skin this has never happend to me. * I've only used this for a couple days, but so far it's great.  A lot of times after I shave my moisturizers haven't helped as my facial hair grew as it still made my face itchy.  This one has been the most hydrating so far.  Also soaks into the skin perfectly.  Also it takes VERY LITTLE to fully moisturizer your face.  

I'm hoping it pairs well with the cleanser!"
29,dermalogica,intensive moisture balance moisturizer,pimprod2003120,2535727," * This cream woke me up because it was itchy. I ended up washing my face & applying Cetaphil to calm my skin down. Returning immediately.
Very disappointed * I have dry combo skin that is not sensitive whatsoever - I could put motor oil on my face and I would be fine. I have never once broken out from a product of any kind. But my skin hated something in this product and I broke out like crazy after just a few uses. * I love this product. It's very smooth & creamy, but not greasy. I recommend it to everyone * I bought this in hopes of improving my dry skin. It did moisturize my skin without it feeling oily. But it made me break out and it smells like chemicals. * I purchased this product thinking it would be a good moisturizer,. I was hesitant to use it because it has a chemical smell, my dry skin improved immediately but I am left with large cystic looking acne on my face. What a huge waste of my hard earned money * I gave this a try and I am so thrilled.  It is wonderful!   I am hooked with its level of moisture.  Others have be sitting on the surface but this one actually soaks into my skin and I can not say enough good things. * I have sensitive irrirated skin and while this moisturizer keeps my skin soft and hydrated, it smells disgusting. It has a very strong chemical odor. It also burns slightly on my skin. The product is expensive, and it's supposed to be made of quality ingredients; this is frustrating to say the least. Especially since so many people recommend this brand."

It completely dried out my skin so every wrinkle and fine line became prominent after I applied foundation. My face did not feel ""moisturized"" or ""double-repaired"". I'll be returning. * La Roche Posay has so many holy grail products for me: The retinoid gel, double repair moisturizer, the effaclar gel cleanser, etc. etc. This product wasn't great though. I have super oily skin so I thought this could save me, but alas, it made me breakout pretty badly. Would not recommend if you have sensitive, acne-prone skin. * Love ittt!! Cleared my face so well! * It pills even with nothing else applied to the skin. Feels really good going on and then it dries down nicely but doesnt feel like you put on moisturizer at all. A little tight. * No point in buying this. Doesn't get absorbed into the skin and flakes and peels off as soon as you apply make up or sunscreen on top. Pretty much a waste of money. Awful product. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Very nice moisturizer. I use it under my makeup for the sun protection. It is unscented but with a slight sunscreen scent. It is matte as its name suggests and is for oily or combo skin as it's not greasy. Absorbs well. * I've tried out a few face moisturizers with spf 30+ and this one is definitely one of the better ones. It doesn't take long for the moisturizer to settle and there is no residue or white cast, but it does peel when you wash it off which is a first for me. The moisturizer has a thick consistency, but is lightweight when applied. I have sensitive combination skin type and large pores if it helps anyone with same problem areas."

Does anyone know if Ulta has old stock formula they have purchased recently? I tried to find question section. So purchase if they have original * In my constant quest for skincare products that deliver real results, I recently tried the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid. This lotion claims to gently exfoliate, boost cell turnover, and provide deep hydration to uncover softer, smoother skin. Let's dive into my experience with this multi-tasking formula.

The lotion is non-greasy and lightweight, making it perfect for daily use. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and hydrated without any heavy residue. The product is fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for those with sensitive skin or a sensitivity to strong scents. The natural smell from the lactic acid salts is subtle and varies slightly depending on your skin's unique pH, but it's not overpowering or unpleasant. * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is revolutionary! It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body."

Very good for sensitive skin with damaged barrier. * Very disappointed in this product that claims to be so moisture rich and especially for the high price tag. It has done nothing for my skin. In fact, I have to apply another brand of moisturizer over it to provide hydration before I can even attempt to apply my makeup. Store brand works better for far less money. * I have oily, sensitive skin & unfortunately this did not work for me. Its not greasy, per se, but not lightweight enough for me, which caused me to break out. * This burns my face ! but it does go away. It doesn't smell good either but other than that it's a fine product. I'm not sure if this or something else made my face peel a little but I'm gonna think it's this given. It's the only thing that's been burning on my face and it contains lactic acid, which is an exfoliate. * First time using this and I ended up buying the middle sized bottle but wish I had bought the larger one when it was on sale. This stuff does calm my skin it absorbs quickly feels weightless and my skin seems to feel better. * It does wonders for my skin"

This cream felt great on my hand when I tested it in the store. I used it when I got home, and my face instantly turned red and blotchy. It burned also. Wish I hadn't bought it. * I don't always believe over hyped products, but this one definitely deserves the recognition it has received. Glides onto your skin like butter, and gives such a beautiful glow. Recently started tretnoin, and my skin has been super dry. This is very moisturizing and definitely helps with my dry flaky skin. Works well under makeup as well. Good for day and nightly use. Highly recommend! * Nothing special at all. Not worth the money. Like a basic moisturizer with horrible rose scent. Returned. * This is an incredibly moisturizing cream that feels so light weight. I use it overnight and wake up with a smooth and bump free complexion. It also does an amazing job as a primer before make up. * I decided to treat myself with this cream as a little birthday gift. Tried it for a couple of days and my skin felt so incredibly dry. I thought it was just the weather so I kept using it. Little did I know, I would get the biggest rash of my life. A bunch of tiny red dots started to appear all over my face, especially around my eyes. My skin burned and flaked, even touching my skin became painful. It's such a shame because I had such high hopes for this cream, but this is NOT for sensitive skin."

I've been using it for 6 months and you can really tell the difference. my face went from being dry and with lots of wrinkles, to now a more hydrated skin and glowing. I totally recommend it. * Just do not use this cream if you have acne prone skin. It actually itched the first time I used it but I thought well maybe it will calm down and I have to get used to it. Welp nope now I have extremely sensitive skin so this is not the product for someone with sensitive skin or acne prone skin unfortunately I have both any bump will find its way to my face…. I've been using double wear foundation since 2016 so I thought why not use the moisturizer…. Bad idea for me and oh yea did I mention it itch as well… good luck will not buy again * I started getting adult onset acne in my 20s. I remember getting a makeover at around 25 & the makeup artist said my skin was very dry which was probably leading to breakouts. I started with Day Wear by Estee Lauder. Its their cheapest lotion & I thought it was fine. Then I bought the holiday box & tried this. Ive never turned back. I'm now 35 & use Revitalizing Supreme every day. While I've contemplated changing several products in my makeup regimen, I've never thought of changing my lotion. This lotion is very thick but doesn't feel or look thick... it provides the ultimate hydration & looks amazing under foundation. I also swear it's saved my face from aging. My husband is my same age & has lines in his forehead and around his eyes that I do not have. He doesn't use anything on his face & I use this daily. I was advised by my dermatologist to only use noncomedogenic products & have never had a breakout from anything Estee Lauder. Highly recommend this. Your skin will from it up like water & years down the line you'll notice its slowed down aging. * The cream is very silky * No review to write because I have not received my order! * Great moisutrizer -- in two weeks seems to have changed the texture of my skin.. plumped it and left it extremely hydrated -- Amazing - well worth the $$$$ * Ok cream but I think there are better options out there that work much better AND save $. Loreal midnight cream and serum are way better."

This lotion by byoma is very hydrating and keeps my face flake free without making it look and feel greasy/oily. Does not cause breakouts. I pair this with the de puff eye cream as well. * This has been a fantastic moisturizer while starting my skincare journey. Feels lightweight and absobs really well into the skin. I love the pump since it helps me avoid using too much. I have oily skin that is prone to cystic acne so I needed something that could balance hydration without clogging my pores. I will keep repurchasing since its so affordable too. * Got it brand new & the pump wouldnt dispense any out no matter how many times i tried or what i did. I literally felt stupid & like i was doing something wrong. Looked it up & apparently this is a common issue..
Not worth the hassle to get it out without a pump & for the price 🤧 its being returned * This product made my skin so smooth and it helped my acne * I will never use anything else!!! This is the BEST!!! Favorite moisturizer on the market! * The best most hydrating face cream to exist! Cannot stop buying this product! * I love this brand because i have very sensitive skin and everything works so well for em. My only complaint is you cant use all the product. I can see it in the bottle but due to poor packing cant open or cut the bottle. I dont want to waste product and with other brands can open the bottle to use the rest. Hoping they change their packaging."

I don't like drunk elephant products in general but this one was honestly a day and night change between my normal barrier cream (Dieux - which I still love!) because it's thicker and I woke up and still felt hydrated. My neck is getting crepey and this felt like it thickened my neck because of how dense it was. I would not have liked this product before perimenopause but now that my skin is red and dry in general this was the drink it's been waiting for! * So many pore clogging ingredients!! I would not suggest for anyone without any prone skin * I have dry, sensitive, mature skin and this works great to moisturize without irritation. The dispenser is great too because it helps limit the amount without touching the rest of product. * I love this product. I use it every night before bed and it leaves my skin feeling dewy abd hydrated. * Immediately after first use, my skin had broken capillaries. Never had this before with any product ever! Woke up to gross, EXTRA OILY skin all over my face. PLUS even MORE pronounced capillaries, redness, and other blemishes! 😭 I am devastated and don't know what to do to repair this!

I am including a close-up of the broken capillaries and my overall face. (Which usually has no blemishes or redness EVER! Might get one tiny zit on my period.) 

I have used Best No. 9 jelly cleanser & Protini Polypeptide cream for over a DECADE and never had a problem!

I take VERY good care of my skin and spare no cost when it comes to that. 31 Female. Combo skin.

I usually have flawless skin that frequently gets complimented!

Got a sample of this with my regular Drunk Elephant purchases. (The Best No. 9 jelly cleanser & the Protini Polypeptide cream.) Never had an issue with their products before! I am devastated!

I don't know what to do to reverse this, but I'm scared to even try a barrier cream (and maybe any other Drunk Elephant products) ever again! * It is super thick and soft, but it does peel off of your face after it dries. It's annoying. Great for super dry skin though. * Perfect moisturizer that is thicker than other DE but not too thick. Absorbs very quckly and layers well with serims and under makeup. My skin stayed hydrated all winter with no redness, patches or flakes. This is meant for very dry skin so if you don't have it, then try one of DE's lighter versions. I'm buying my third soon but it only takes a minimum amount. Highly recommend."

I actually prefer a water based product because it means less harsh chemicals. * Horrible formula with major separation. When you squeeze the tube, a large amointod bluish tont water squirts out, as if it separated. When yoire lucy wnough to get actual product out, it works grest on irritated skin. I coild r get past getting sprayed with wster evedytime i try to use it so i returned it. * Tried to use this product many times, each time it was straight up liquid. Shook it up many times, same thing. Manufacturer says its still ""efficient"" but its not, its not even usable * This was recommended to me by my doctor who is currently treating me for a severe vitamin deficiency issue that has resulted in scurvy and other issues. As a result I have extremely dry skin that does not get better and after only 2 weeks it WORKS! * This product clearly separated as a bunch of water comes out every time I try to use it. I tried shaking it together but it still happens. Not just a bit of water, a lot! That's gross and I can't imagine that's what's supposed to happen. Tried contacting guest services but as usual they were useless.
Save your money! * This cream was my holy grail for a year and then they changed the formula and it started breaking my skin out. * I absolutely love this cream! I was influenced by TT to try and I have no regrets. I have very dry and sensitive skin and this cream hydrates along with calms my skin. I've been using this since November and it has not made me break out more or dried me out. Would highly recommend.

Thanks to the nice person at Ulta who introduced this product to me. * This cream is so good. You feel the richness in the cream when you apply it on your face. It is deeply moisturizing and not light like some other creams. I love it, definitely recommend * This smells wonderful! It has a nice consistency and absorbs quickly without disappearing. It is on my repurchase list. * Have tried various moisturizers different brands and price ranges. This one by far the best one ive tried and the only one to proivde consistent results. * This cream makes my sensitive skin soft and smooth. I usually get dry flaky areas in the winter and I have none with this cream so far! The Hope moisturizer made me break out, but this did not. I will never be without it. * Bought this when it was on sale. Smells like plato but it did help with fine lines and felt moisturizing on my skin!

While it has a nice texture and the ingredients look fabulous, this cream resulted in the worst allergic reaction I've ever experienced. After two uses, my skin was visibly red, tingly, textured, and incredibly itchy. Unfortunately think this damaged my barrier as my skin is still recovering using other tried and tested products. If you have sensitive skin, I'd skip. * Oh how I wanted to love this. The ingredient list looks nice, and I'd heard good reviews, but unfortunately this cream just did not work out for me. I have no idea what's causing it, but this moisturizer somewhat burns my skin every time I apply it. It also seems to be making my facial eczema worse. The texture is different, more of a whipped consistency, but still hydrating. I feel like my skin might need more moisture though. It's also expensive for what it is. Unfortunately it's too late for me to return it, and since it was pricey I'm going to use it up anyways, but I would not repurchase. Honestly you can find many just as good-if not better face creams out there with similar ingredients, that cost much less. * Made skin dry and itchy, not moisturizing. * I use this over the mad hippie super A serum, at night before I go to work. And I love this product. I don't use it twice a day but you probably could if you wanted to. This also feels like a rich moisturizer after I use the mad hippie enzyme scrub, it just makes my skin feel wonderful. I have acne prone skin and also wanted something good for anti aging, since 30 was approaching. * I wanted to love this product. I wanted a night cream with collagen & this has mostly good reviews. But the morning after the 1st time using it, I had 2 huge red zits (which is unlike my normal skin). Every time I use it, I break out the next morning. * Love how soft this cream makes my face feel!

I only need to blot once a day at work instead of three! * I have used FAB products before. Always liked their daily moisturizer but i have oily skin so it didn't help, but this oil control moisturizer helps a lot. My skin doesn't look as shiny. Perfect product for summer. It is not heavy at all. * In my search for an oil-free moisturizer this was recommended. I used this for a month and loved it. No breakouts, controlled my oily skin and seemed to work really well. So, I stocked up and got more. I noticed something was different after the 3rd use of the new jar. I started breaking out. I haven't broken out in almost 3 years. I was confused and continued to use it because why would it start breaking me out now? I loved the first jar. I'm not sure if the formula changed or if my skin is just being finicky. 

Overall, I recommend the product because it seems to be very good. It's a struggle for us oily girls to find products that offer us a balance of hydration while keeping oil at bay. I hope it works for you if you try it :) * Ever since Neutrogena discontinued their Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin - my holy grail of moisturizers - I have been desperately searching for a replacement that will keep my breakouts under control without over-drying my skin. The search is finally over - this is it!! My skin starting clearing up and looking healthier after the first overnight application! I've now been using it for 2 months and it's continued to significantly reduce my breakouts (in frequency and duration) without drying out my skin. The only downside is that the container is about half the size I was assuming it would be, based on other FAB products I've purchased. (Although that's on me for not looking at the size printed on the front of the product.) Each container lasts me a little over 2 months with one application per day on my face and sometimes neck and/or chest. Honestly though I'm in love. * Ive used this product for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin and have used several different face moisturizers over the years and this is the only one that keeps my face from getting super shiny by the end of the day, even with serums underneath it. It WORKS so to me its worth every penny! * This is the best moisturizer I have ever found for my oily skin! I have an oily t-zone and this keeps my skin from becoming oily all day. I worked an 8-hour shift wearing this and when I got home my forehead was still dry, but not peeling, it just felt finally normal. I use this on my entire face, but keep in mind you can use it only in certain areas that you struggle with oil, so don't let other reviews about dry skin deter you. With winter coming up I may begin to only use this on my oily areas and another moisturizer on others, but this is literally the holy grail moisturizer for anyone struggling with oily skin. * I have combination skin and this has saved my skin texture and made it so soft. The consistency feels so nice and it's not overly drying even in my dry areas. Feel like it's reduced some redness as well."

It has proven itself to be incredibly moisturizing in hot humid Florida, while also proving it's worth in cold snowy New York! Truly recommend for anyone looking for a great moisturizer * Love this stuff. I ran out for couple weeks and my face could tell and started getting larger pores on nose and breakouts. I'm back to good * Product works well in the winter with keeping psoriasis in check. * I've never had an allergic reaction to any beauty product in my life. After my second use of this product, I got hives, and my throat and tongue swelled up. I had to go to the ER. I'd guess other users' burning feeling is related. * This cream worked wonders on my daughters eczema! We used it twice a day and her eczema has cleared up. * I didn't initially love the smell of this since it's fragrance free but does have a slight clean smell. I was surprised at how well this moisturizer wears and doesn't get greasy or leave a residue. The bloom bottle is so cute and innovative, it produces the perfect amount of product to cover the entire face. The only con is the bottle is a little large and isn't the best for traveling. Still not a huge drawback and overall one of the best moisturizers I've ever used. * Please tell me why I just bought this product at Ulta and it was already opened/used? THATS DISGUSTING! How am I supposed to know if the product is contaminated or not??? I have really dry skin and really needed something to help restore it, but I guess it cant be this product. Ulta needs to do better! They shouldn't be allowed to sell opened products, especially if they cost so much. Idk if I want to continue shopping at Ulta because I'm not sure if any of their products are safe now.

So sad. * It may not help the lines and aging affects on my fqc3 but the cream makes my face feel smooth, youthful and healthy. It may not be so but it feels good * I thought this was a great product and that the flushing on the neck and breakouts on the apple of my cheeks was due to rosacea. Nope. It was this cream. Under the sun with this cream it is even worse. 
Tricky part: not all my face was burning nor breaking out. And burning is not immediately after applying!
I stopped using this cream and my face is on its way to recovery. 
So, be aware. I read another comment stating kind of the same situation. I was actually going to reoder, but was curious about the 1 star reviews and finding ""that especific comment"" put an end to my nightmare. * I was going to reorder this product, but I was curious about the 1 star reviews and someone mentioned experiencing the same issues as me. 
Looking back at the date I started using this product ""THE RICH CREAM"" and doing the math I realized that this product causes rosacea-like symptoms. I was even flushing and sensitive to heat. Expose to the sun with this cream on was cooking my skin. Yes, I'm beating myself up, because I was actually thinking the whole time that this cream was helping me keep my skin moisturized at least. 

Here is the tricky part: not all my face broke out, felt hot or uncomfortable. My forehead, chin and nose were normal and moisturized by this cream. 

All symptoms were strong on the apple of the cheek (malar fat pad). Therefore, my dermatologist told me it was just rosacea.

Another tricky part; I didn't feel any stinging or burning immediately after applying. The symptoms were triggered with heat and moist. 

I can reasurre that the issue was this cream. I put it to test. 
I rarely leave reviews these days, but this whole situation was a nightmare to me and I hope I can help others. * One of my favorite products! * Light & fluffy ! It works well! * I wanted this to be good as I use Clinique daily moisterizer. Its hard to rub into your skin and peels up. Feels gross! Glad I biught the smallest size! Waste of money!"

I have oily skin and probably spend upwards of $1K a year on products trying to find things that actually do as they claim, and this is one of them.

I was a little reluctant to purchase this as the price is pretty high for a brand I've never used, but I'm glad that I took the risk on it.  Prior to this moisturizer I was either using none at all (because most others just make me more oily, dont need redundant products on oily skin), or I was using the La-Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Matte one which didn't do much for me. Obviously how this will work for you is going to be different for everyone, and the other products you use prior to your moisturizer will make a difference as well.

For reference I am a 28 yr old female, white/Caucasian.  My morning routine is: wash with a clay based cleanser (Dermalogica), tone (Fenty Skin), hyperpigmentation serum (Good Molecules), niacinamide/zinc serum (Sunday Riley), then this moisturizer. The consistency of this product is great for oil as it is a gel based product, but it comes out more opaque white than clear which is fine. It does not have much of a fragrance that I have noticed, but I'm not sensitive to fragrance so I wouldn't be one to say. When I put this on it almost feels as if it is a crossover between a moisturizer and a makeup primer that blurs your pores.  Now it does not make your pores go away by any means, but it does HELP.  Immediately after applying my skin is definitely mattified but again, not completely shine free as if it is a primer with the sole purpose of making your skin look like it has powder on it. It does not make my skin feel tight and dried out, it genuinely makes me feel moisturized and smooth without the glowy look that normal moisturizers do. From my experience it definitely does not keep me matte for 8 hours, I would say after about 3-4 hours I start to see shine on my face to the point where I feel the need to blot if I were going out somewhere (this is all without wearing makeup or anything on top of my morning skin routine, I work from home).

If you truly have an oily/combo skin type this is not going to be your holy-grail product that makes all of your problems disappear (will continue to search for it), but if it is within your budget for a product of this type then this is 100% top 5 best moisturizers for oily skin on the market right now in my opinion after having used this for a few weeks now.  Would repurchase (and I rarely ever find products I do)!  

I also just want to throw out there that I did buy this on my own, was not asked/paid to write this, and I think this is either my only review I've ever written on Ulta or one of a few over a span of years that I don't even remember. * The packaging is very luxe but the pump feels like its empty and its still half full. It doesn't mattify anything but it is a nice mix of a gel and lotion and a lightweight moisturizer. This is an MLM and I do feel it's overpriced for what it is. It's pretty basic. * Matte effect that works great as a moisturizer/ primer for oily skin types"
49,good molecules,lightweight daily moisturizer,pimprod2023937,2582316," * I got this moisturizer as a free gift and I ended up loving it! Its not heavy, but still has a rich creamy texture. I have oily skin but this keeps it balanced throughout the day with/without makeup. * I live where the Winters are dry, sometimes under 10 degrees F, 0 or below wind chill. My skin gets very dry. This moisturizer is good for the Summer because it is light weight and absorbs quickly but it doesnt cut it during Winter. After I apply my skin feels dry 10 minutes later and I end up reapplying. * If you are even the slightest bit acne prone, do not buy this product. Within a day of using this product for the first time, I developed incredibly painful cystic pimples that still have not fully cleared up even though I stopped using the product after only three days. I love good molecules, but this product is not for me, or any other acne prone individuals. * I usually do not take the time out of my day to write a review about anything but I have to for this one. This is the worst product I have EVER put on my skin. It gave me the most painful, cystic acne that wouldnt go away for almost a full month after using. If I could rate this product a zero, I would. On top of thay, it is greasy and leaves a weird residue when using. * I had seen this product online and i had bern looking for a new moisturizer from the price to hydration its perfect my only complaint is not enough product a bigger size would be amazing!!  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🤩💦 * Nice product * This moisturizer is SO good. Tried it on a whim and it's become a new favorite. It's lightweight and has no harsh fragrance that I've noticed, so great for sensitive skin! I wear moisturizer every single day so my ONLY con is that it doesn't come in a bigger size!"

Also not irritating for sensitive skin, helps my makeup to go on better as well - bonus! * This has been my go to for years and I recommend it to everyone. My skin is so sensitive it doesn't like anything else so it's worth the money. Plus I look younger than my age. I'm 31 and regularly get mistaken as anywhere from 18-25. * I have used this product for years and ive always been happy with it. * i love it sm its the only moisturizer i use it makes my skin so dewy and soft 1000/10 would reccomend (if you have moderately dry skin like me) * I've tried many moisturizers for my dry/combo skin and find myself coming back to this one over and over. It's so expensive but hydrates deeply and doesn't dry up after application. My skin actually feels softer and not like I'm just applying oil on top or adding water that dries immediately. If gel moisturizers aren't enough for you but you don't want to feel like there's a layer of oil on your face I definitely recommend. * Received a coupon so went to Ulta to use on product don't normally go there * Great customer service and would recommend this to anyone with dry skin."

This product listed shea as an ingredient as does the aforementioned. Well, my skin hasn't been clearer, pores smaller, literally no makeup other than a mineral spf. I'm stunned with the results in two weeks. Please try this if you have combo or dryish skin...young or mature. * I use IT face cream and love it but wanted to more moisture in my skin.  this product is amazing and I am so glad I found it.  Makes my skin feel so soft.  Love it!! * This moisturizer is moisturizing, however there are better, less expensive great ones out there.  I have used it for about a month and I do not notice anything amazing that would justify the price or a repurchase. * I cannot use this brands skincare and makeup products. I am very allergic to the products * Absolutely HATE this cream. Made my skin break out in tiny pimples that I am having a hard time getting rid of.

It really is moisturizing HOWEVER as someone with extra dry skin i do need to use more product than normal which i dont love as im trying to ball on a budget. it also winter tho so i might try the moisture bomb and use aqua bomb during summer. i also LOVE the texture of this and think its so perfect for summer bc it feels very cooling/refreshing. i also do have sensitive skin and this caused no reactions. * I love this product! I usually have flaky dry skin but since I have been using this I feel fully hydrated and it gives me a glow ! 10/10 would recommend * Absorbs well, ny skin is VERY dry and my skin just inhales this * Like others have mentiones, this gives skin such a lovely glow. I have been repurchaing this for over 3-4 years now. Costco had a twin pack of this along with the belief face wash. I bought two for myself, which took me a while to get thru, but i did. I finally had to repurchase. But yeah buy it. Youll have plumpy glowy skin all day. * My skin was clear and i start to breakout becouse of this product * I received a sample of this product and never went back to my old moisturizer.  Smells wonderful and absorbs quickly. * My skin tends to lean towards oily and this mositurizer is the perfect formulaion to hydrate my skin but not cause it to look or feel oily."

They both came expired and it was really hard to try to exchange them because none of my local stores had them for the quick exchange. * Love this moisturizer, and a bigger plus it has sunscreen! * I like the packaging and the texture. It makes it seem luxurious, but as a dry skin girlie, its not very moisturizing. For a fraction of the price, Bubble was way more moisturizing. * I have finnicky, acne prone middle-aged skin and this is the first sunscreen I've ever used that doesn't break me out with daily use (otherwise I have to rotate products, ugh). It really is a great primer, too. As another reviewer noted, the packaging isn't great. On one hand, it's a luxurious look but I'm finding it necessary to be extra cautious to avoid cross contamination. * I like this product a lot but i bought it in may 2025 and i just looked at the bottom of if and expired in august of 2025 * Not all of supergoop products are winners Unfortunately, i noticed this sunscreen caused my face to be slightly inflamed and red and irritated for awhile. And oddly, what made it worse was i touched my face later with my finget that was damp and it started to burn! Very weird. Then i happen to rub my chin and it just started pilling and coming off. Wouldnt even bother trying to put makeup over this one. * I'm a fair-skinned man who has been looking for a daily moisturizer/SPF combo for years that does not irritate my eyes as the day goes on. This was recommended to me by a coworker and an Ulta employee separately. I've been using it for a year and swear by it - I like that it doesn't have a scent, moisturizes well, and most importantly, has NEVER irritated my eyes. This is my go to. Cannot recommend enough. Love it so much that I've gifted it to my siblings."

I am very happy * Love this I give it a 5 star rating! Don't get this if u don't like oil on ur face. I love alot of moisture, so this does well for me. I do have sensitive skin, and this did not break me out. Great buy 🤩 * I love my Tula skin essentials 😍 my skin is popping! It really closed my pores. I know the reviews aren't good but; I had a  free sample of the face wash first, so I knew i would like it. I would say this if u don't like scented or oil on ur face, then pass on this. I love alot of moisturizer on my face so it doesn't bother me at all! Also I have eczema and it doesn't break me out although it's scented 😳 I love it! Love it! * Sometimes when I buy kits, I'll use most of them (but not all of them). With this kit, I use every single one of the products in here and I LOVE them! * I am SO VERY HAPPY I was able to purchase this set for my BIRTHDAY MONTH!!!!!  I am officially 51 years old.  My skin is incredibly HAPPY!!!!!  I have used TULA products for the past 6 years and when i saw this particular set on sale during the 21 days of beauty I HAD TO BUY IT!!!!!!!!  PLUS i was able to use my 20% off AND my ULTA REWARDS!!!!!!  So i got this for a STEAL!!!!!  OK so NO More bragging about me.  TULA has some of the ABSOLUTE BEST ANTI AGING AND SPECIFIC ROUTINE ADDRESSING PRODUCTS!!!!!!   I have had issues with drying skin around my mouth (upper area to chin).  And i have used everything under the sun!  However when i got to use the TULA 24/7 cream:  I WAS INCREDIBLY HAPPY!!!!!!!!!  Finally my skin is HYDRATED AND FEELING WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!  And I not oily on my forehead or nose!!!!!!!!!!  Love, LOVE TULA PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!! * This product made my oily face feel even greasier. * I did not like any product in this bundle. The facial cleanser doesn't get makeup off well. The moisturizer left my skin greasy, The brightening undereye stick didn't do anything but make my concealer go on wrong."
58,beautycounter,countermatch adaptive moisture lotion,pimprod2038174,2606567," * I had used the clinique dramatically different moisturizer for years (terrible I know) and had such a hard time finding a moisturizer that didnt make my face burn or irritate my face. This is it! Love the clean ingredients and that it doesnt have much of a smell. My husband has even started using it, and that is saying something. * I have tried so many moisturizers. I have sensitive skin and I am also very careful with certain ingredients I use on my skin. This is the best moisturizer, it's hydrating but not greasy and great for day or night. I just mix it with my sunscreen in the morning. * I wanted to love this moisturizer because its clean- I didn't even mind the smell even though some complain about it. But I noticed after several weeks of use, I had many blackheads on my nose and chin. I didn't realize it wasn't non-comedogenic so that was on me for not paying attention. If you have acne or get breakouts, I wouldn't recommend this. * I wish the people who get the products for FREE other wise known as influencers would just be honest. I found it no big deal I've used other products for alot less money, but the 5 ⭐ crews won't be getting free stuff if they don't give a high score. Wait a few weeks to buy it and if you don't like return it, so this is an HONEST review. * Love it!! * I highly recommend this! I kept finding moisturizers that either broke me out or pilled on my face (deal breaker). This one does neither and keeps my face moisturized. It is on the pricey side, but I bought it on sale. The only thing I don't love is the smell. At first it just smells like nothing, but once I rub it in it's almost a chemical smell? Not sure, but I'll take that over not breaking me out. * It goes on like silk and makes your face feel soft and smooth. Feels good after I put on my toner and serums and then it's like a nice after finish. Good smell. Overall the best moisturizer I've used. Somewhere between a gel and a cream"
59,olehenriksen,strength trainer peptide boost moisturizer,pimprod2042287,2617224," * I love a thick and rich formula but without any type of cream. My pores are easily congested by anything too heavy but this gel formula is amazing. It's not greasy or sticky but heavy enough to combat any harsh weather. * As someone who has dry & hormonal acne, this moisturizes as well as helps heal my skin barrier.  I wake up glowier and well moisturized. Highly recommend, but it is pricey so im only able to get it when its on sale ): * After a month of using it, I started breaking out on my cheeks. Prior to using this I was using korean skincare and never had this problem.. Just be aware of possible breakout if you have acne prone skin. * This is difficult for me to say because I have usually loved OleHenriksen products, but this moisturizer was not for me.  I have been trying it for two weeks and have yet to notice anything other than my skin feeling sticky for quite some time after applying it.  It feels good going on, but I my face feels very sticky even an hour later.  I will be returning it and trying something different. * I wanted to love this products especially since it was pricy. I usually never break out , but unfortunately this made me break out. I have normal to dry skin. I was just using it at night. I'll probabky try it again after a while. * I got a travel size to try it out and at first it seemed just normal. Then I started using retinols and feeling dry and realized this stuff really brings the skin back to life! I was using it as a night cream and was waking up looking youthful, healthy, moisturized and repaired. The redness was reduced, the fine lines around my eyes were plumped, and my forehead was looking really good! This has such a wonderful light citrus smell and is very thick and balmy. It doesn't sting my skin and feels very healing. It's probably best for nighttime but if you are dry or it's the middle of winter, you might need this for rescue during the day also. I'm so glad it was on sale because I wanted the full size of this again so badly but didn't want to spend the $50+ for this product. I haven't found a comparable product anywhere. * Ole Henriksen is my go to, dependable always reliable face cream. Whenever something is going on with my skin, I grab for my Ole Henriksen and within days, my face is back to normal.  Zits will disappear, it is amazing.  I love Ole Henriksen and never without.  I always ensure to keep a full jar in my cabinet and always a spare since my skin care routine cannot afford to run out and be without.
I highly recommend this face cream to everyone."

Its texture isn't heavy, and it can be used at any time of day. * I really like this moisturizer and recommend it for those with oily and combination skin. I have combination skin during the winter months I sometimes felt this wasn't moisturizing enough but it was still good! * Lovely moisturizer, absorbs well into the skin and it doesnt leave face looking too matte or too glowy, works well with makeup. * When I ran out I was so sad but I got another one and it cleared my face completely. I do think you should get bigger sizes of the Bubble  so you don't run out as fast. * It is soo nice especially if you live in a dry climate like me. Feels amazing on skin and doesn't leave it oily. Not to mention the great price! * This is actually my second time repurchasing this product. I love it because it leaves my skin feeling moisturized but not greasy. It also doesn't break me out, which is great because I have really sensitive skin. I get all my actives from serums, so if you're looking for a moisturizer that just hydrates your skin, try this. * Is good"
61,peach & lily,glass skin water-gel moisturizer,pimprod2020749,2572404," * This moisturizer is lightweight in that it does not feel heavy, but DEEPLY moisturizing, providing an instant glow! I use this in the mornings before applying makeup/skin tints and I never need to use a primer with it! Fungal acne safe! * The only CON about this moisturizer is that it is pretty sticky/ tacky while patting it onto the face to absorb as it starts dries. My skin is pretty sensitive so it starts to hurt when it starts getting tacky. If it wasn't so sticky, I would love it more. Overall, I still do like this moisturizer. It hasn't gave me bad rash or broke me out badly. I like that it's fragrance free and silicone free. I never really cared about the ingredients of skin products before and just used whatever. However, I have become more aware of the things I use as my skin condition has started to change since I've reached my 30's. I will buy this again. * I wanted to like this so much. But it is so sticky no matter what i do. I have combination skin, but cant use anything with oil in it or I break out. But this did nothing to hydrate my skin. It claims to hydrate without leaving skin sticky- but it did the exact opposite for me. * PEACH & LILY Glass Skin Water-Gel Moisturizer Is a god send. It is so light weight and adsorbs quickly into your skin with no sticky feel * I have oily skin and I regret not trying this moisturizer sooner. It provides the skin with hydration without the feeling of stickiness or oiliness throughout the day. Way better than my Tatcha Water Cream. Will repurchase this one to wear in the AM! * I have had oily or combination skin my whole life. Never used moisturizer before, since my face looks very youthful and most moisturizing products made me break out. I older now, and need moisturizer-this is the best product ever! * It really does leave your skin looking like glass! And no oil buildup throughout day. I breakout using just about anything on my face, I have not broken out once in 6 months using this brands glass skin line."

This day & night cream was a game changer! Doesn't leave behind that weird greasy residue that some moisturizer creams do or give that weird tacky feeling when it dries. Just pure softness. * I could not tell how well this product worked since I have sensitive skin & broke out using it. Tula has other great products that I use frequently, such as Glow & Get It Cooling Under Eye Balm, but this Gel Crème is not for me.  I will be returning it. * I recently started using the TULA 24-7 Weightless Day & Night Gel Cream and have been impressed with how light yet hydrating it feels on my skin. The gel texture absorbs quickly w * Loved this! I will definitely be repurchasing myself. After just going through winter my skin was so dry, this helped a bunch! It didn't irritate my skin and left it feeling moisturized. * I am a skincare junkie, and well, this one just worked well for my dry, mature, 50-year-old skin. I feel as we age, our skin changes anyway, but I never thought a gel would be better for my dry skin. This one is truly like water for my face. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The texture is very smooth and it's very cooling. I like that the moisturizer is very gentle.

I have really bad eczema on my face and this helps everytime when i have a flar up * I have been hunting for a lotion since the panthenol rebarrier cream was reformulized (broke out super badly from the new formula) and I noticed too late the Cerave in the tub moisterizer- while not irritating or breaking me out gave me mild congestion over time. My skin hated me for months as I kept testing new moisterizers. Finally I cross referenced all the ingredients (thanks Claude AI) and I found the common trigger was glycols! Who would have thought. Its been 5 days using only this moisterizer and no new breakouts, redness on cheeks coming down, no irritation and no congestion. Who would have thought? This may not work for everyone but it definitely did for me. If you had the same problem as me or similar I highly recommend doing patch tests on everything and observing the effects of each moisterizer for at least a week. Then input every moisterizer in Claude AI and then Claude AI will narrow down the common triggers and be able to recommend something. Anyways this wasnt meant to be a promotion for Claude but here we are. Im just thankful i finally found my holy grail! * I had peri oral dermatitis for a while and this helped so much in my recovery process. It is VERY rich and hydrating.

AMAZING * I do not usually have issues with retinol and I am always careful to use sunscreen and moisturize properly when I do. This broke me out into small scabby rashy areas on multiple areas of my face with itchiness. It's been four days and it's worsened each day. After reading recent reviews and seeing similar comments, I can only guess that the recent formula change is what made a seemingly well-rated product act so rough on my skin."

I've only used it one week.  My skin looks a bit better after one week's use.  I just might pop for the larger size.  I would suggest people buy the mini size when a product is BOGO.  If you try one container and don't like it, you can give the other to a friend.

However, the product sits on top and doesn't feel like it gets absorbed by the skin (even if i exfoliate and i dont have clogged pores). It does keep my face from turing red in cold weather. Maybe this product is more of a barrier protection than moisturizing. 

I have bought other products from this brand and they all had same effect…sit on top of the skin instead of getting absorbed. Not the brand for me and won't be buying any from this brand again. * Its very rich she creamy, but not too heavy on the face. * I am on my fourth or fifth jar of this moisturizer and I had to finally leave a review.

I buy another jar where I start seeing the bottom of my current because I don't want to go a day without it. * I had been using Clinique and I thought I would try this to see if it worked better. It seems to be about the same so I am not unhappy with the results. It did say it came with a free gift which I did not receive. Perhaps I needed to request it so my fault. * I haven't been this disappointed in a skincare product in a LONG TIME. This feels SO WEIRD on the skin - it just sits on the skin like a cast, I can't even describe it. I can feel it kind of tingling, or numbing for 1-2 hours after application. It's terrible. Do not tecommend. * I get the driest itchiest skin in winter. This cream is a life saver. I have never had skin so supple and hydrated until i found this. Its like how u feel right aftee a facial except its everyday! * Broke out in red itchy / peeling rash on my cheeks. Also dry patches on my forehead. I love this brand but not this moisturizer. Returned it immediately."

I would still be putting it on my face and it would just roll in to clumps. I dont reccomend this product. * I thought I was going crazy when I had a burning sensation after using this bc of all the hype but yeah, it did sting. Also flakes and made my makeup look flaky. * Great for acne/acne prone skin. Moisturize but lightweight. I love the ingredients. Definitely recommend * Goes on smooth but PILLS the moment it dries if you touch your face with anything. DOES NOT work with any other products bc of this. Aside from pilling it dries to a matte very thin layer with no hydration or plumpness. I thought this was supposed to keep you feeling moisturized but it disappears and you feel the need to add more. 0/10 i would not ever use this even if free. * My previous moisturizer had increased in price until I could no longer justify the expense, I tried this and it outperformed the more expensive one in every way. My skin feels firmer yet soft to the touch. A little bit goes a long way and my skin absorbs it completely without feeling oily or sticky. I use it in the morning and with my retinol serum at night. * I buy this cream all the time! It's the best ever thing that keeps my face smooth and healthy looking. I get compliments all the time ! And for being 66, it helps me stay wrinkle free!! * If u think ur going to slather this on think again! This product pills like crazy! U cannot put makeup on without extreme technique and it still rolls up .. Get vanicream I'm telling u!"

I have tried many moisturizers and I have finally found one that works! * the product seems good but if you know what some of the ingredients in this does to your body you will not want to apply this to your skin ever.. lots of endocrine disruptors which is thyroid issues along with a host of others.  some of the ingredients have to be authorized for manufacture to continue use. * I got some of this with a Lancome gift. I love the way it moisturizes and doesn't leave a greasy feel. Skin on my face feels so soft all day long. Had to buy a full size and now the gift one is in my travel bag. * My mother bought this product and I noticed it had a strong fragrance to it. Now I'm not a dermatologist, but I have enough knowledge to know that anything fragrance is horrible for your skin. Anyway, my skin broke out in hives when I tried this product, along with acne. Please don't buy skincare from Lancome, it's not the best for most people. * I love how this looks on my skin! It's matte but hydrating. Happy that it has hyaluronic acid as well. My makeup looks so good now! I used to use tatcha but didn't like oily it made my skin look. This will now be my go to! * I have normal to dry skin, but a lot of moisturizers will clog my pores if i sleep in them. I just stopped wearing a mositurizer to bed altogether for a while for this reason. When I saw the ingredients in this I became curious and decided to give it a try. My skin is so hydrated and looks beautiful in the morning! Also, if i develop a blemish during the day, I will still slap this moisturizer on top of it at night and not only does it not make it worse, it actually heals it and my skin clears up so much faster! Highly recommend this product. * This was recommended to me by the consultant and I love it."

I have oily skin but this keeps it balanced throughout the day with/without makeup. * I live where the Winters are dry, sometimes under 10 degrees F, 0 or below wind chill. My skin gets very dry. This moisturizer is good for the Summer because it is light weight and absorbs quickly but it doesnt cut it during Winter. After I apply my skin feels dry 10 minutes later and I end up reapplying. * If you are even the slightest bit acne prone, do not buy this product. Within a day of using this product for the first time, I developed incredibly painful cystic pimples that still have not fully cleared up even though I stopped using the product after only three days. I love good molecules, but this product is not for me, or any other acne prone individuals. * I usually do not take the time out of my day to write a review about anything but I have to for this one. This is the worst product I have EVER put on my skin. It gave me the most painful, cystic acne that wouldnt go away for almost a full month after using. If I could rate this product a zero, I would. On top of thay, it is greasy and leaves a weird residue when using. * I had seen this product online and i had bern looking for a new moisturizer from the price to hydration its perfect my only complaint is not enough product a bigger size would be amazing!!  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🤩💦 * Nice product * This moisturizer is SO good. Tried it on a whim and it's become a new favorite. It's lightweight and has no harsh fragrance that I've noticed, so great for sensitive skin! I wear moisturizer every single day so my ONLY con is that it doesn't come in a bigger size!"

Im an oily skin girly with large sebaceous fillaments. This moisturizer genuinely is the only one ive found that doest leave me feeing oily halfway through the day, works well with my makeup, and works all year long. * I love this product. * Years of using water based mosturizers, i got this as a free product.. but im actually in love with it. I have oily acne/sebum prone skin. It does its job without breaking me out or clogging pores. Please try this its the BEST. * Makes my skin feel hydrated and soft supple all day. * I really wanted to be in love with this but I have a ""special need"" that is not totally addressed with this cream. I have been experiencing dry flaky patches upon waking and late afternoon. This face cream has great ingredients and goes on nicely. It does not irritate but it's not hydrating enough for my dry patches. I have used several different Azelaic acid topicals for this issue and really need to find a better one. Perhaps if I do, this cream would be fine. * I have used Elf products since their very beginning & am always amazed at how far the company has come!  This product is gentle, calming, moisturizing, afforable, & cruelty-free.  I use it in the AM after cleansing & under my sunscreen, & at night after cleansing my face.  It's a true winner! * I was previously buying a moisturizer that hydrated my skin so well but was expensive. I tried many other products but nothing did the job until I tried this. I LOVE IT."

It pairs great with the pore purifying foam cleanser. * I do like this moisturizer there isn't a age limit for this moisturizer. It can be for young skin too, and it's hydrating & light on skin , but the only thing I personally dont like is that it only lasts a few minutes on the skin its a good-affordable moisturizer tho ! * I love this product it make my skin feel smooth and fresh  l also got this product for a friend waiting to hear back from my friend Excellent product also love the price and size I would recommend this product to more friends and family also easy to order at ulta where I get points on rewards membership * This is the only moisturizer that has really worked for me. I had stopped using it because I thought it was breaking me out (turns out it was another product) but went back to it when I did have a really bad breakout and it completely cleared it! * i feel like i barely need a primer, it's so good! hydrated and softened my skin so well * this is my favorite face moisturizer. it's decent price for a face moisturizer, and i've never noticed any issues after using it. it does it's job, and I love how lightweight it feels on my face. plus, it lasts so long for a small bottle. * I started using this product as my face tends to be oily and at the very beginning, it was working perfectly - not oily residues for sure. Issue is, after a while of daily use, my skin would feel dry; even patchy. Wouldn't wear underneath make-up, for sure."

She looks so useful she's 89 years old and she's still going strong. * I just purchased my second jar of this cream.  I like it very much but do not see what it actually did for my skin.  Unfortunately I have a weakness for buying products when they are on sale and this was 50 percent off.  After I am finished with this jar I think I am going to try Loreal Paris products and see if there really is a difference or am I paying for the name and packaging.  All in all I like the texture of the cream goes on wonderfully and does make my face soft. * Love this product and the trip made better when the rep was present. Love her * I am a long time customer of this product, but didn't realize the product name and packaging is almost identical for the TWO DIFFERENT moisturizers.  I inadvertently purchased a jar without SPF—essentially unusable to me in the summer. * I tried this laat night and my face was getting so itchy within an hour of putting it on. I wiped it off before bed but woke up this morning with a swollen and itchy face. My face is not usually sensitive like this, but if you are sensitive i would definitely not recommend this. * I used this cream on and off for many years with no adverse effects. This time, I had a serious allergic reaction that has lasted for a week. My lips got very swollen, and itchy, sore blisters appeared all over my body. Beware if you are sensitive to chemicals. * I loved how soft it made my skin and if you can tolerate it, it's a great product. Love Lancome. However, there is a strong fragrance to it and my sensitive skin got very irritated. I wish they made a fragrance free version, I would repurchase. Until then, I have to give it away"

The duo smells nice and feels jice going on. Howecer this juice was not worth the squeeze and the dispenser clogged easily and often. * I went to buy a product that was highly recommended. The store associate introduced me to the Juice line, and it is the first product line that I honestly felt almost instantaneous results. * I started with the samples and i was really hoping I would hate it since it is so expensive. Unfortunately I loved it, and now I'm forced to spend a fortune on skincare.

I generally love Fresh products.  The scent of this cream is amazing and it makes my skin look and feel really nice. However, I'm only able to use this as a night cream due to the awful pilling issues under makeup.  I've tried using less cream, waiting several minutes before putting on makeup, tried different foundations/bb creams/cc creams, and tried different makeup application techniques (makeup brushes, sponges, fingers)... but the pilling issue is awful.  It also pills under certain sunscreens.  I suppose this cream would be great if I had No Makeup Days, but I literally wear face makeup everyday. * I've been using the fresh skincare line everyday for over 5 years. The rose deep hydration cream and rose toner are all that I use and my skin has been amazing. No clumps no pilling like the other reviews here. * I was excited to try this given some of the reviews but compared to other moisturizers this one falls short. I dont feel it absorbs great and it pills off so I end up with little balls of product all over my face. My skin does not feel as moisturized or soft as when I have used othwr products. For the price ramge this is disappointing. * Its just ok, smells great- like a treat. But my skin's just not moisturized enough with this. * It doesn't get observed in Skin leaves clumps of residue on the skin. * I was blaming another product for irritating my skin so I went back to my basics and was fine. I ran out of my basics so I applied this all week and have noticed itchy skin around my neck again. It smells nice and went on nice but I would not recommend for sensitive skin."
85,lancÃ´me,uv expert defense spf 50+ primer & moisturizer,pimprod2004242,2541521," * This product is fine but it doesnt leave my skin looking particularly great. So, there isnt much value for me with this product. * I bought this when it was on sale (thankfully) after reading all of the amazing reviews. I'm glad that it works well on so many others, but unfortunately, my experience with this primer has been nothing short of frustrating. For reference, I'm 4W1 in Estee Lauder's Double Wear foundation. I've worn this alone as a sunscreen, which results in it forming white streaks on my neck and around my nose and lips, which looks quite disgusting. When worn under makeup, it starts to pill, resulting in me wasting the last half hour of my life prepping my skin for foundation since I have to take it off and start all over again. I'd suggest that people try it on in the store and see how it wears or wait for it to be on sale like I did (even then, it's not worth it, in my opinion). * I love it every time I put it on. It feels silky and luxurious, absorbs quickly and leaves a glowy finish. It's a primer with sunscreen so has a very small whitecast but not visible under makeup. * I had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately, it was a major letdown. For the price, you don't get enough product, and the formula is just not it—especially for brown skin. It left a noticeable white cast and made me look gray and oily throughout the day. Even when I skip makeup, it still PILLS!!!, which is incredibly frustrating. I really wanted to like this, but it's just not working for me. Is it just me, or is this a common issue? Either way, I can't recommend it. * This is invisible but it's oily and breaks out your skin. * I know fragrance is not good for us but I tend to like scents. This one is just too much and too long. If Lancome had a frangrance-free option I would prefer it but returning because I can't get past the smell. Bought it during half off sale. I definitely wouldn't pay full price. * Great product"
86,clinique,superdefense city block broad spectrum spf 50 daily energy + face protector primer,pimprod2014019,2560146," * I've used other tinted moisturizers with sunscreen that have more pigmented colors that actually look like foundation and cover imperfections. I would say this doesn't look at all like I'm wearing foundation and doesn't cover any of my sunspots, but it also doesn't have a white cast on my medium tan skin. I've been using it daily for a couple of weeks and it also doesn't make little crumbly bits all over my face like some primers do. For my 47 year old skin this works perfectly so I will continue to use it and I'm going to try to get my teen daughter to wear it too; she hates makeup so hopefully the fact that this doesn't add color should check the right boxes for her. I'm also going to add that we both have eczema and Clinique is the one brand that doesn't cause flares that we can both use. * The formula is lightweight and I love the slight tint. * I love Clinique products and am especially pleased with this cream so that I can ride the motorcycle without getting too much sunburn on my face and forehead. * I have very sun sensitive skin & love this product.  On busy days I use this on top of a face setum & moisturizer, then add face powder & Im out the door.  Also takes liquid foundation well.  Im actually here looking to buy my 2nd tube.  I have rosacea that causes acne & this product was not irritating to my face.  Big win! * Now that summer is here, I don't go anywhere without it! I used to sparingly in the winter but now that we are in full sun days its a must! Its not to thick or greasy. Its blends into my skin beautifully and my makeup last all day! It does a great job of hiding and protecting my dark spots to make sure they dont get worse or more gets added to my face. Keep this product around forever please! The 50 is my jam! Sensitive skin commemter here! :) * Tried it in store per the clinique associate and I really like it! It is on the thicker side but it spreads nicely and doesnt pill when paired with clinique moisture surge 100H or peach and lily's matcha moisturizer (my two HG moisturizers). You need your moisturizer to dry for 15 minutes and THEN apply your spf, this dramatically reduces it from pilling. It does look very orange when dispensed but it gives me a great sheer tint that looks like I put makeup on, its beautiful! So I wear alone typically on non-makeup days but does work very well as a primer as well (I use IT cosmetics CC+ foundation in light warm medium. For reference, I am also WN04 Bone in Clinique even better makeup so light/med and the tint works great for me. Wish it came in a bigger bottle! As it is pricy when you apply the standard 1/4tsp. * Im sooooo impressed with this product! I only need a little and i blend a small amount of foundtaion for a sunkissed look. I will not be running out of this all year round! Woohoo"

This lotion claims to gently exfoliate, boost cell turnover, and provide deep hydration to uncover softer, smoother skin. Let's dive into my experience with this multi-tasking formula.

The lotion is non-greasy and lightweight, making it perfect for daily use. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and hydrated without any heavy residue. The product is fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for those with sensitive skin or a sensitivity to strong scents. The natural smell from the lactic acid salts is subtle and varies slightly depending on your skin's unique pH, but it's not overpowering or unpleasant. * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is revolutionary! It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body."

Is is very creamy and feels refreshing, and absorbs nicely into my skin. It doesnt feel like it just sits on my skin. * I really love the way this spreads on my face, it like melts into your skin as you rub it in and you don't need that much. This would be great for someone who doesn't EVER get pimples. This unfortunately broke me out ALOT, like straight up cystic and fungal acne. I haven't had acne in over 3 months and once I started using it, it broke me out. So doesn't work for me but might work for you. * This is great. It works well on my skin. Im not even kidding, i washed my face and put this on, a few minutes later my boyfriend comes in amd starts going on and on about how good my skin looks. He proceeded to TAKE HIS PHONE OUT AND TAKE A PIC OF ME BAREFACE, and now its his background. All on his own accord… so this stuff may actually bring miracles into your life. Its also very hydrating and works great under makeup! * I read a comment that someone said its too much for their skin. First if you have oily or combination skin dont buy this is truly for normal to more dry skin and give the hydration that my face needs! * I never leave reviews but im super confused by all the good reviews for this!?! Maybe i got a faulty one or something but this product is terrible. It dries my skin out so much and is too thick to even rub in, i feel like this would only last me a month since you have to use so much of it...

I never write reviews but I absolutely had to for this one. It pills terribly even if you don't have any other products or makeup on your skin! Nevermind how bad it pills up under makeup! I've had to redo my entire face three times before I finally realized this is NOT the moisturizer for me. I still have horrible patches of dry skin which I've never had with a good moisturizer. I had such high hopes and with all the amazing, glowing reviews - I am left feeling that maybe I got a bad batch somehow? Or maybe my skin is different than most girlies! It leaves dry patches, so I used it PM hoping that it would moisturize my skin overnight. Every time I've used it at night, I've woken up with several pimples!

It has a strong citrus scent that serves no purpose. The oils are the last ingredients so why bother?? If you're sensitive to fragrance this is prob not going to make you happy. Go with First Aid Beauty instead. * I love this face cream, it's luxurious, it feels great putting it on and is super hydrating. * So hydrating and soft on the skin. * I got this moisturizer in a gwp, and just recently decided to try it. I applied a generous layer as the final step in my evening skincare routine, and wow! I can't believe how much I like it!

I have very dry, sensitive skin, so I'm pretty picky about the products I'll use on my face. This product checks all the boxes! It doesn't pill. At all. I layer several products, and still never get any balling or pilling. My face stays nice and hydrated without feeling greasy or sticky. Highly recommend. * If I could give this 10 stars I would.

The dispenser is ingenious and doesn't waste product like so much packaging does. At first you must press several times to get it going; from thence on it dispenses the perfect amount.  Once it seems ""empty"", I pry it apart and find very little is left...maybe enough for one application, but clearly the packaging is designed so you get all the product with no effort and it cant be contaminated .

I wanted to like it so bad but I think the winter air makes it hard for me to find lasting products. I will by this again when the air is less dry to test its affects. * I purchased this to use as night time moisturizer during the winter since my skin gets so dry, and it unexpectedly improved my eczema! It has also really helped heal a burn scar on my wrist. I apply it over my arms, legs, and feet before bedtime, let is absorb for about 5 mins, and wake up to soft skin. * My skin is very oily and sensitive and I decided to try this out because I like getting my moneys worth but also being on budget. This cream is awesome the bottle is big and it leaves my skin hydrated all day! Love it never ordered a moisturizer 2x but this one takes the cake ! * I love this cream! Do not get me wrong with this review headline, BUT Ulta over charges! You can almost buy 2 of these at other retailers compared to the price here at Ulta. Ulta do better! * I, at almost 52 years old, have managed to get eczema. Never having it before in my life, I was NOT aware of the extreme ITCH it causes! The itch is unbearable! I got a prescription cream which miraculously helped, and the doctor told me to get a really good lotion for my dry skin. Which led me to this. Vanicream is a thick and rich lotion that makes your skin feel amazing. It really helps irritation and eczema flare ups along the way. I will be a repeat customer! * This is a pretty great moisturizer for your feet! My feet get super dry and cracked when I stop using this, but when I'm using it actively and consistently I have no issues with that whatsoever. It is super thick, making it extra moisturizing so if you don't like a thick moisturizer, this one's not for you! 10/10 in my book though! * I went through an entire tub and bought more after. I love this for my whole body. It is pretty thick, so a little goes a long, way especially for the face."

Been using them for years. * Used this cream over a year and developed an eye issue of severe swelling and eye twitching.   It stopped when I quit using this cream. * Smells unpleasant. Leaves my face greasy. Just ok. * been using this since October and there is ZERO different. I use it every day and it is not made to be worn under makeup. your makeup will not set and wipes off easily. there is no damage reversal, my sun damage is still visible. don't waste your money on this. there is no product on this planet that will remove your hyperpigmentation. you're stuck with it. I don't care about scent, but this is a very thick and heavy cream, absolutely not a moisturizer. doesn't wash off your hands well either because you can wash your hands and your eyes will water very badly. very disappointed in this product cause I normally use no. 7. * Can somebody tell me why this smells like wet cat litter? Not used cat litter.... new cat litter but wet. Like when you use it to swap up moisture. 

I guess it works okay even though it's really heavy for a day cream and I'm 53 so I wear heavy creams during the day! But the thickness of this is like a night cream, but of course night creams don't have sunscreen so weird. I just can't get past the smell so it's sort of doesn't matter how well it works. * I tried this as it was on sale. Been buying No. 7 for years. While the product felt great on my skin, there was an off scent I can only describe as throw-up. Really bad. My daughter concurred with me, and I ended up tossing it. Would not recommend."

This moisturizer left me with a burning sensation. Do not purchase this; it hurts. * I purchased this on a whim out of frustration of not finding a good moisturizer. I used to use La Mer Cooling Gel Cream and then it got replaced. I have been on the search for a replacement ever since. This moisturizing gel is excellent! It absorbs quickly and is still moisturizing enough for my combination skin in the Texas summer heat. It's very lightweight and i can't tell its on. My favorite part is that it does not get sticky throughout the day like other gels. It also does not break me out where I do get oily. I do use a primer, so it keeps my oiliness down. But it works well with it. * Goes on light. However it doesn't feel very hydrating. I have sensitive combination skin. It really irritated my skin, and made my rosacea and eczema flair up. * there's a lot to like about this. I am diabetic so dry skin is a constant problem for me and I am very sensory sensitive, most lotion is difficult for me to use because of how it feels. 

This lotion absorbs fast, it's a gel so it's very lightweight, it doesn't leave that weird slimy feel that most lotions do, AND it's really helped my skin improve it's actual health. I use this during the day and at night I use the renewing one. That combination works the best of literally any facial lotion I've ever used. * I have oily skin and sweat a lot. I use this in the AM and PM paired with retinol, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, and vitamin c serum. this is light enough to apply before SPF without feeli g too heavy. * Another good skincare product! The only downside is when you get down to the end, you can't really tell if you've used it all or not, so I keep pumping it. * I have been Cerave moisturizing cream for years as it has been the only cream that has worked for my dry eczema prone skin, so I thought I would give this a try. I have combination skin that is more on the oily side. I liked the texture and feel of this product. Unfortunately I ended up having a terrible reaction to it - red bumps all over my face. :("

Not too heavy but covers perfectly. * It contains 3 highly pore-clogging ingredients for acne prone skin! Alcohol, shea butter, and coconut! Beware if you have acne. I tried it once and it broke me out! Now I've spent weeks trying to clear up my skin. * I went into Ulta looking for a new, clean face cream, eye cream and face tint. Ended up buying all of that and the primer. I've been using it all for 5 days now. My skin has never been dryer!! It's all going back! Almost $300 and, for me, it's awful. * Based on the reviews, wanted to try out something new. I was in search of a better moisturizing cream. This wasn't it. First off, is it me or does it smell like Windex? The worst part, ended up with some serious cystic acne. And I'm over 60 years old! Extremely disappointed. Would not recommend."
102,elemis,pro-collagen marine cream spf 30,pimprod2004522,2545254," * Im absolutely obsessed with this moisturizer! I received the 1.0f fl oz in one of the monthly make up bags I pay for. When I went to the store to grab a new one i was sad to see how expensive even the small one was. Luckily they had a trio at the time, and it turned me on to the resurfacing pads and cleansing balm then. Pricey but totally worth it!! Will be a part of my daily skin care routine for the foreseeable future! Luckily it lasts quite a while and you do not need too much! WORTH IT! * Gorgeous day cream. For reference, I am 31 years old with combo skin, leaning towards the dry end. I have some light wrinkles. While I can't say this did much for my wrinkles, it made my skin look plump and supple for sure. Very hydrating and rich, and the SPF is a huge added bonus. Gifted by Elemis. * I've been using the ELEMIS Pro-Collagen Marine Cream SPF for a few weeks, and I'm genuinely impressed. My skin feels firmer, smoother, and hydrated all day long, and it gives a silky satin finish that makes makeup glide on effortlessly. I love that it combines anti-aging benefits with SPF protection, so I feel like I'm taking care of wrinkles while shielding my skin from the sun. The subtle rose and mimosa scent is a lovely touch, and the texture is lightweight, never greasy. I've noticed my fine lines looking softer, and my skin feels plump and nourished. Definitely one of the best anti-aging moisturizers I've tried! Gifted by Elemis * This is the second time I buy it . I really like it and the price is very reasonable. I like how it feels on my fat. * Elemis graciously gifted me this product. I love Elemis and have loved everything that I have received from them. One of my favorite face cream but with spf in it …yes please!!Get as much spf out of your products that you can. Definitely recommend!!! * Big fan of the Pro Collagen Moisturizer, so when I saw this SPF ran to get it. Very similar formula, very hydrating and fast absorbing, which is a must on tropical weather. The only thing I don't love is the packaging; a pump or a tube would be best, as that way is easier to apply without touching the rest of the formula. Gifted by elemis * Expensive but worth it! It absorbs beautifully and doesn't have a greasy feeling. I have normal, acne prone skin so I use retinol at night. The SPF is a perfect bonus to protect and hydrate my skin at the same time. Light and pleasant sent! Gifted by elemis for my honest opinion."

Many people complain about it peeling or balling up. YOU'RE USING WAY TOO MUCH. A little goes a long way. I love the way it moisturizes all day. * This day wrinkle cream works well for mature skin. It absorbs well and keeps my skin feeling supple  without being greasy. Most creams I've used leave my skin feeling tight and emphasize wrinkles. This makes my skin shine and healthy looking. * I would buy this product again because it really makes my skin look soft and d supple and smooth. I lo e .it the clinique products  I would recommend  to anyone that wants their skin to feel soft and smooth. * I like that the spf level is 30 spf. * Happy with Clinique day cream because it has spf in it. Will buy again but wait for a sale * i usually use Olay products, which I can just buy at the drugstore. But I get some haircare products from Ulta, so thought I'd see what comparable moisturizer-sunscreen they had and give it a try. I know Clinique is a good brand, but for the money, i think I'll stick w/ my much cheaper Olay product. the Clinique product just doesn't absorb into my skin as well as Olay, so i feel as if it's not doing its job as well. * Just got this today, it burns so there's that and I've never had sensitive skin. And it's rolling off in little white rubbery balls all over my face and neck and even in my hair. Yuck! Would love to return but they probably wouldn't let me since I've opened and used but wow, what a disappointment!"

I am 21 years old, I have skin that is easily allergic to a lot of products, and have rosacea. I also get extremely dry skin year round that cracks and starts to burn. I have tried lathering myself in aquaphor and many different moisturizers but nothing works like this product. I put her on and she is ready to put makeup over in less than 3 minutes, and she doesn't cause my makeup to pill, which I love because both this moisturizer and my bb cream are water based. On my no makeup days, I only need to apply her once in the morning, and in the past I would need to reapply moisturizers almost 3 times a day. Like I mentioned above, I struggle with redness in the cheek area from rosacea and have noticed that going down signifigantly since I started using this product. It is so calming, hydrating, easy to use, and really lives up to its name. The only con is how expensive it is but it is definently worth it to claim any sales going on to give her a try! 
I don't know how my skin lived before this product!! * It's a nice gel moisturizer, but not as moisturizing as I need for a ""senior"". * I think it works and it doesn't clog the pores. I have combination skin that is prone to being oily, and the only other moisturizer that worked so far was from Purito brand. It is worth it if your skin isn't overly dry and if you're scared of breaking out. * On melanated skin often times moisturizers with spf leave a residue. This does not. Doesn't feel heavy on the skin. * Indoor heat has been a real threat to my skin. I knew i needed to change to something more creamy and absorbent. This was recommended to me and I'm so pleased with the results. It's not greasy, absorbs quickly, and helps my foundation stay fresh all day. You need ti try some tiday. You won't be sorry. * I was looking for a good moisturizer and this one was part of Ulta's January sale. It feels good on my skin and I'm
glad I purchased it. I will definitely buy again! * Hands down my favorite skin quenching moisturizer.  Lightweight but keeps my skin nice and hydrated without being oily."

It's possible it could make your face greasy in the summer. It is thick and very moisturizing yet it absorbs quicker than you would think without leaving my skin greasy. It has a light clean apricot scent which does not irritate my skin. It has niacinamide, peptides, hyaluronic acid, and more! * I have veryyy sensitive skin when it comes to moisturizers. This worked sooo well and i get so many compliments on how glowy my skin is! I love this product. I switched from a similar product that's like double the price from Aveeno and i like this even better! * I love how it feels on my skin. I wouldn't recommend it if you're on the oilier side , because it is quite heavy… that's my only concern, it seems like it has the possibility of being comedogenic , so I'll see if I suffer from breakouts. * I have been using this for years and I love it.

Eye burn and severe watery eyes. * my skin feels so good and softy, i like it so  much"

Doesn't burn or irritate my sensitive skin and is a great choice for lightweight moisture. To use overnight I would add an occlusive lotion overtop though. * Wow! I cannot say enough about this! I have very dry and super sensitive skin that is always red and dry. I had my skin good for a while til winter came ans then it got rough like sandpaper and red again! I was so annoyed so  I researched and found my skin barrier definitely needed help and Corsx was highly recommended for dry and sensitive skin. When I say i tried it at ulta as a sample from their tester, the next day I bought two of their products! Immediately I saw results, it applies smooth ene even and not greasy. It immediately gives you a hydrated dewy look in a healthy glow way! I was so impressed and my skin actually felt like it was absorbing the moisture. The next day i woke up and it was noticeably better, no redness and the rough texture started to smooth out! I was like oh yes finally something thay really works well and no break outs or irritation or just sitting on skin not really helping much. If you need a moisturizer, have dry senditive skin, and especially for cold winter dry air months, this is it!!! Try it for sure, highly highly recommend and I will be purchasing for as long as this product is available and made! I also recommend the Corsx ceramide skin barrier moisturizer, i have been dampening my face wirh water, then taking that moisturizer and pressing it into the skin (not rubbing) and then leaving to dry and then layer this intensive moisturizer on top of it, then i oil cleanse my face later and put on the intensive moisturizer ahain for overnight. Also a little goes a long way for this product, it will last for a while! * This is a nice cream.  Not to heavy and not to light.   I'm using it over their peptide serum, which I like.  These products work well especially for their price point!! * I initially tried this during the dry winter days but it was too greasy. Its super hydrating so i tried to use it at night instead but after a few weeks it gave me fungal acne in my nasolabial folds. It is ultra hydrating so could work for others, but not for acne prone skin. * I absolutely love this cream. It quickly became a must have for me. My skin is so moisturized and has a healthy glow. I even started using it on my husband's face and it has helped him as well. I will be buying again and again. * I can't find the right words to describe this product. In just two days it made my skin way better hydrated, smooth, and glowy. I finally found my dream skin care brand. * This moisturizer is everything I've been looking for. My skin gets very dry during the cooler seasons. I noticed that my bb cream and foundation were flaking no matter how much I prepped my skin. I purchased this because it was on sale and I'm so sad I didnt find it sooner. My skin feels so hydrated and it did not make me breakout. It absorbs beautifully into my skin. I use it morning and night. A little goes a long way. If you're on the fence, wait until it goes on sale and try it."

It rubs in easily without a greasy feel, and I think it has improved my dry, bumpy arms. I will continue buying it! * Good lotion. My dermatologist recommends it.

So far this product has left me pleasantly surprised, it didnt leave me a greasy mess at the end of my work day. I will add that I hydrate and moisturize well before applying this to keep my skin balanced. I think that others who say they are left greasy probably have dehydrated skin. Making sure you not only moisturize your skin but hydrate it as well! * This did nothing for pores or oiliness.  Wish I could still return it. * Does not mattify or control oily skin.  Just terrible! * I beg you Murad, never get rid of this product. It has changed my skin so much. I used to fight my oily skin constantly. With this I feel like I have normal skin I don't have to worry about mid-day.   I stop myself from overstocking because I'm scared it'll stop being made. If you have oily skin I implore you to give this a try. * This is fine on its own for a workout, but it pills horribly if you put any makeup on top. No oil control. Very thick formula that does'nt spread easily, so you'll go through the tube very quickly. * I have oily, sensitive skin so it is very difficult for me to find a daily sunscreen.

Super hydrating and a great value * It has definitely helped keep my skin hydrated and protected this winter; no breakouts so far and it sits nicely under my sunscreen. My only con is that it is a but thick, but if you take the time to work it into the skin a little bit does go a long way. * This moisturizer is great for all ages. My 40 year old niece was telling me about it and then I realized I already had some! I loved it when I used it originally,  then for some reason I started using something else. I'm 72, most people guess me to be in my late 50s. Granted, I'm blessed with good genes, but this moisturizer does do a great job! It's not greasy, it blends well with any foundation or concealer I may use and you only need to use a dime size dollop for your entire face and neck. I highly recommend all of The Ordinary products that I use with this moisturizer being at the very top of my daily regimen! * I had dry patchy skin especially on my forehead for several years that nothing would fix. This moisturizer healed my skin barrier and dramatically changed my skin. This is one of few products I will keep repurchasing and will not let myself run out of. * I purchased the Glow Set from the Ordinary because I already knew I loved the Glycolic acid from this brand but needed to find a moisturizer to help my dehydrated skin barrier. I've been using this Pyhtoceramides moisturizer and WOW. It's rich and creamy yet not too heavy. leaves an unbelievable glow. It feels amazing on my dehydrated combo skin! I have been using this at night after my retinoid or azelaic acid from this brand and when I wake up... chefs kiss.

I wish  I could say it actually makes a difference in my skin, but I can't say for certain that it does, mainly because I am only able to get it from time to time and cannot afford to buy it to use it consistently every night. I still love it and it is a special treat when I can get another one. I definitely recommend it! (Please ignore the tag that says ""It really works"" it will not let me leave a review with leaving that tag. I sure hope it does though!) * I really like this moisturizer! I have been looking for something new and finally found it. I needed something for aging skin and this has definitely improved the appearance of my skin. I will definitely buy again! * I love the Shiseido essential energy products (red containers) so I assumed the benefiance products would be a step up, but its sticky and thick and oily. I personally do not like this product and feel that its too pricey for being MEH. * my skin had been flawless for months/years until i started using this. now i have tiny pimples everywhere. pass on this. and my skin is typically tough btw * was excited to try this, but the cream was greasy, heavily fragranced, and led to milia. wouldn't recommend * So initially i used this brand and broke put due to sensitivity issues. 
I went to a doctor after having the same reaction to various skin care products and was told to slowly introduce products into my akincare regimen. 
now shiseido is the only brand i use for my nighttime routine. * My skin is perfect. Both times I've tried this it made me break out in tiny pimples all over my face, wherever it touched.

Absolutely no moisturizing at all – pretty worthless. * I had really awful redness all over my face the next day morning after using this product. Maybe im allergenic to certain ingredient but I personally won't use it again. * I used it after using red light theraphy and really noticed a change in my skin. * I love bubble products and this left my skin glowing. It feels like silk going on. It lasts for SO long. * I was shocked by how luxurious this product feels.

Love these produxts, and yeah the funky smell and texture is because these are clean products instead of chemicals! ❤️❤️❤️ * I've been through 3 bottles and haven't noticed any significant difference in my skin.

I decided to branch out recently and try another retinol product from a different brand, and I'm realizing what I've been missing out on, and at a lower price point! Overall, I don't hate it, but it really did nothing for my skin. * I love it! I have a combination skin. My t zone always gets oily with white heads. I started using it last year and it really helped clear and brightened up my face. I continue to use it since it keeps white heads away and oiliness at bay. * Love the way it leaves my skin feeling.

BYOMA is oneof my faveitie skincare brands on the market right now. Shea Butter is unfortunately a pore clogging ingredient for my acne-prone skin and its oretty high up on the ingredient list. However, this moisturizer is such a good texture and leaves the skin soft, plump & glowy. It would be perfect for someone with normal-dry skin that is not acne prone!

I only use it at night and it has lasted me 6+ months. I have very sensitive skin and don't break out from this. I took 1 star off because it hasn't done anything for the few dark spots I have.  But it does leave my skin so hydrated and glowy. * I was also excited after reading all the reviews. I started using Dime last year. They say to give it at least 3 months to see results. My skin kept getting worse, but I hoped it'd turn around. After almost a year of using their products my skin is dryer and has more wrinkles. It also made me breakout and I rarely have breakouts. I have dry/sensitive skin. This wasn't for me. * It works well * This is causing my face to break out all over. I will not be repurchasing. * I absolutely love the TBT cream. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated. * I had a sample of this and enjoyed it so I was happy to get the full size. It doesn't smell like before. Before I felt like it had no scent and now it has a chemical kind of scent. It's still moisturizing and I enjoy using it so one star off for the scent. But that's clean beauty for you."

It does smell good but for the price and the fact that it did nothing for my skin…I will not be repurchasing. I would say to give it a try it might work for you. * I love cream because cream is soft skin * The smell is beautiful! Very light and clean. It sinks in quickly and leaves a radiant glow. * I'm 37 years young with olive skin tone combination but dry t-zones, and a mom of 5. Let me tell you this moisturizer absolutely hydrates your skin without breaking you out or feeling tacky on the skin. I highly recommend. * I've purchased this 4-5 times. I love this face lotion! * This moisturizer is just ok. I don't get the glow. It is a decent enough product, but not worth the price to me. * I was excited to see that my favorite day time Clarins Moisturizer was on special for half price. Since my jar was half full, I thought this was the perfect time to have a new jar ready to go."
122,supergoop!,play everyday lotion spf 50 with sunflower extract pa++++,pimprod2029934,2589381," * I work outdoors in a desert setting and have a Fitzpatrick type II skin tone, so sunscreen is a must. I love that this formula isnt greasy, and doesn't have any white cast. It rubs in easily and doesn't dry out my skin. I also love the scent, which is a fresh almost eucalyptus/citrus-y fragrance. This makes it more suitable for year round wear, since it doesnt have the tropical coconut-y fragrance that many sunscreens have. I've never had anyone come into my office and say ""oh it smells like sunscreen in here"" when using this product! My only qualm is that its not cheap, but I do love that I can purchase it in the large pump container. * Im not dirw why more people don't mention what a great facial sunscreen this is.  Not only does it work and protect my skin from the sun, it leaves a slight dewy look all day but not oily! I use it over my moisturizer and them add a little blush and its a perfect no makeup look. Love this ans price is so reasonable. I have sensitive skin and do not breakout with this. * The way this product has a chokehold on me! I slather myself in SPF from head to toe every morning and before any outdoor activities, but could never find a suncreen that didnt get all over my clothes or smell like sunscreen. This product is perfect! It absorbs SO WELL that I put it on before getting dressed and it doesnt rub onto my clothes. It also has a very light and fresh scent that is actually enjoyable. I purchase this in every size so I always have one on me, but the pump is great for the bathroom counter! * Skin irritation occured after using this product. I didn't even want to give it one star! It has some sort of scent, citrus maybe in the product, but doesn't specify that anywhere om the packaging. Wouldn't recommend this product to anyone! * I love this sunscreen and love that it comes in this big jug. I don't understand why all other brands only have small sizes when we are suppose to use a good amt daily. I love that there is nonwhite cast. It blends into my skin and although it's pricey I do t have to buy sunscreen every other week now. * Not fungal acne safe 
Smaller than expected 
No white cast * The best body sunscreen I've ever used. I have very pale skin and burn easily. I applied and reapplied this sunscreen before being at the beach for hours and didnt burn at all."

1. I have oily skin, and this product works great to give my skin that god moisturizer that it needs. 2. It works well with my other products, it doesn't make the other products to separate or become cakie at all. Over all it's a 10/10 from me * This moisturizer has an interesting texture. It's almost like custard? Dries down nicely and leaves your skin feeling soft but not sticky or greasy. Unfortunately it aggravates my type 2 rosacea and causes bumps so I cannot use. * This moisturizer makes my face feel so soft . Plus it doesn't clog pores. This might be my favorite moisturizer. Will purchase again. * i had a severe dermatitis flare up and this is the only thing that helped as a person with extremely dry skin its perfect it's lightweight and not greasy seriously my holy grail * When I tell you that I have the most sensitive skin ever, I have rosacea, I have to use fragrance free everything, I cannot use any sunscreen except mineral, so on and so on…. it has been an ongoing battle to find something that really calms down my redness and irritation. I tried this on a whim. I've just looking up products and their ingredients and I will never use another moisturizer again, this even beats the elf fragrance free holy hydration for me!! * My skin went bonkers when I moved from the desert to the PNW. You'd think going from dry to humid / hot & sunny to cool & cloudy would have been a welcome change but my skin just kept getting red, dry and inflamed. So I tried this. And my face immediately felt better and, over a week completely calmed down. That was over two years ago and I'm still buying it. That said, the price is ridiculous for the size."
125,peach slices,snail rescue all-in-one deep moisture cream,pimprod2033309,2597524," * I really do like this moisturizer !! It does not leave your skin looking greasy, and provides a nice glow to the skin. However, in my experience with this product, I find that the hydration lasts for only so long. While I don't experience dry flakiness, my skin feels tighter after around 25-30 mins of applying this product. Sometimes I have to reapply, and I am generous with the amount I use! However, I would still recommend this as it does have great ingredients for the skin, and maybe be better suited for different skin types. It also may be because it is winter. Nevertheless, I'm glad I tried this product! Just didn't find it as effective for me :) * All hail the snail! I'm so happy I impulse bought this product! It's literally the perfect formula for oily skin in winter months. It goes on almost like a lotion serum, and dries like a suede finish, not sticky at all. I wear under my Nars Light Reflecting Foundation and don't even have to blot all day. Please do not alter this formula it's literal perfection!! Also, I am 40, my skin has changed a bit since age 35, I am MUCH more sensitive than ever before and I've always had uber sensitive skin. This is a godsend... * Love this moisturizer! It's very hydrating, and I find that it isn't greasy. Sadly it just isn't for me. It's very humid where I live, and this moisturzer is just a bit thick for my skin. If your skin gets dry easily or if you live in a dry climate definitely try it! If you're like me and your skin just gets congested easily, then I might try something else. * i use this at night and the other one with the lighter cap during the day. It is the only cream moisturizer i can use that wont break me out. When Im extra tired at night I'll just use this as my eye cream instead of my separate cream. Now that its colder my skin needs more moisturizer so this is my go to some mornings as well when my skin is dry. * I got this cream by accident instead of the oil free one but i must say if u have oily skin even tho it feels nice and bit lightweight, it does not moustirize your skin! I love the purito bamboo one instead, this one just makes your skin feel tight and dry but maybe it works better for other skin type * I've been using this for over a year now and really like it. I use it in the morning and at night. Makes my face feel really hydrated. * I love how there is no fragrance. I really hate skincare products with fragrance. This is a nice moisturizer for during the day. I use an even heavier one at night. It doesn't seem to give me enough at night. I just turned 40 and it's like my skin changed over night! I went from oily to dry. So I had to change up my whole type of products and found peach slices! I am so happy I did!"
126,the ordinary,natural moisturizing factors + beta glucan,pimprod2039174,2609860," * I have combo/sensitive skin. This stuff will sting quite badly if you have even the slightest skin irritation. Most times I didn't know my skin was irritated until I applied this, and it doesn't soothe at all. On good days it doesn't cause any stinging. It also does a very disappointing job of moisturizing. About 1-2 hours later my face will feel dry as if I put no moisturizer on if I use it as a standalone moisturizer. The only thing I like about it is the lightweight texture and that my skin isn't oily after use. It has some benefit and mild moosturizing but honestly I've used serums and hydrating toners that do a far better job alone than this product. * I've been using this for a year and I love it, moisturizes with no residue, mixes well with my other skin care items.. so I love it! * I picked this up thinking it was the lotion moisturizer. I dint really like the gel feeling on my skin but it does seem to work well and its not sticky afterwards and dries fine. * caused break outs is number 1 . 2nd off the texture is extremely odd.  it doesnt just feel like a gel. its like aloe Vera kind of.  it stays sticky and it doesnt feel hydrating at all . I'd pass. I am oily sensitive acne prone for reference * I have very dry skin. and this stuff is so amazing. I put it on and then its good all day! And no break out. * My skin feels soft and hydrated from using this moisturizer. I will be buying this product again * I do not like the greasy feel of normal moisturizer and this is super cooling and more hydrating."

Ended up getting this in the mail for free from ELF and it's perfect for oily skin. Love the texture and how cool the gel feels on my skin. I believe it is fragrance free and this is inane and weirdly specific but I like that it smells like a freshly cleaned museum... * Love this moisturize! I'm new to ""beating"" my face and the moisturizer step is soooooo crucial, and this product works great! * Great product. Feels great and lasts a long time. I have repurchased several times. This is a staple and part of my everyday routine. * I love how hydrating this product is! It' is super refreshing. It is not necessarily heavy like other lotions I have used before, but it is great for whenever my skin starts to feel oily or sweaty. As someone with combination skin type, this is a great product because it does not make me too oily or too dry. * I noughg this gel moisturizer instead if the cream by accident- tried to give it a shot. Dont like it!"
128,byoma,moisturizing gel cream spf30,pimprod2039807,2611682," * I have combination skin and have tried SO many sunscreens. They never work because they either don't rub in well, pill, or have a white cast. Not this one! It blends perfectly, wears well with makeup, and feels moisturizing! Can't recommend this enough * Its a great moisturizer that spreads evenly and blends in well, leaving a great glow on the face. BUT once makeup goes over top, it pills soooo badly. I've trued changing foundations and skin prep and it is the same result every time. * This SPF is one of my favs and I always get compliments on my skin being glowy when I wear it! 10/10 recommend. Didn't break me out either! * Not that I had irritation after this, but for my skin gel moisturizers work better, this one was heavy on the cream. I don't remember what my skincare was like back when I used this moisturizer at the end of my routine, but I just felt like it was taking forever to rub in and not really moisturizing my face. Personally felt more like a lotion than a gel cream. If this one doesn't work for you either I'd suggest Byoma's other product, the pink gel moisturizer is what I kept using after this one. * I wanted to like this. Seemed good cause its a light gel moisturizer and goes on nice.  Liked that it has spf. But once it drys on your face it pills so bad. Just makes a mess especially of your layering makeup on too. Definitely would not recommend. * I wanted to love this but it pills sooooo bad!! * I have tried so many different brands of sunscreen. I have very senstive, acne prone, oily skin. This is the first sunscreen that hasnt caused me to break out, leave a white cast, or make my skin burn. And it feels so nice on your skin."

I will never stop using it. * This is a great product * Usually a bit out of my budget range for skin care. However, this product is well worth the investment. It has left my skin feeling absolutely amazing! Obsessed with this product. * I have not worn any Lancome products besides their glosses but tried this when I was inside of Ulta then walked around the store. Omg! What a difference. The redness in my cheeks and by the corners of my nose went away. And my skin looked immediately brighter. The feel of the creme itself is SO luxurious and you only need a little bit so it will last a longer time (of course we want that with this price lol) * I love this product and ordered it online for a mother's day gift. However, I somehow got a refill, so it came in a plastic container with a tear-away foil cover and no jar. I didn't even know refills existed for this. I didn't have a container to place it in (other than using a cheap Ziploc bag), so it would have dried out. Hence, I had to return it. I'm not sure if others have had this issue, but Ulta, please be aware! * Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo my mom is a dermatologist and she loves it!!!!!!!! * I have been using this cream for about a month and a half. It feels pleasant and smells beautiful, but does not live up to its claims in my experience. My face does not feel fully hydrated by the end of the day, never mind 24 hours. I have not witnessed brightening or firming. A big selling point (and likely excuse for the huge price tag) is the Grand Rose extract, which Lancôme does a poor job explaining the benefit of. Luckily I had Ulta points to use on this cream, and not my own money. I got roped into the illusion of grandeur and prestige with this Absolue cream. Don't be like me. Much more effective and affordable creams are available on the market. Research ingredients; rose extract offers unremarkable and lackluster benefits. Perhaps the Pro-Xylane and shea butter can, but certainly not in this formulation."

Im almost out of my first jar and purchasing my second jar! * I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I have noticed little change.  The only thing this product has helped is maybe some redness and my skin looks a bit tighter.  This product is heavily scented which I believe caused me to break out.  I do not wake up glowy or even feel my skin deeply hydrated in the morning. Tried pairing this with hyaluronic acid to see if that would help but it made my skin burn by combining those two ingredients... * Seems to be a great improvement in my skintone over all. Will buy this again. As an added bonus it smells great, like tropical fruit, guava and mango. * Honestly, the main reason I bought this mini cream was the scent. I didn't even care if it did anything else. I figured it was good because of the price and I did see a lot of positive reviews. Some people say the scent was different before, but I cannot vouch for that as I am a first time buyer. It has a very light, natural peachy smell. I usually don't like fake peach smell, but this was just right. It is a rich, moisturizing cream and in the morning my skin feels rested and nourished. This is the last thing I put on at night and it sure feels like a treat. I highly recommend it. * This cream goes on smooth, non greasy and soaks in quickly, however, the scent is very strong and over powering. If it wasnt for the strong scent, I would really like it. * I tried a sample and I was hooked. This is an amazingly luxurious night cream. It is thick in texture and lightly fragranced with the scent of freshness. I am always impressed with how moisturizing it is. It feels so soft on my skin and I am happy to have found it. * Loved this night cream...very, very rich!"

I'm on my 4th bottle I like it that much!! * Recieved a sample and used on my seriously purging skin. It never irritating my sensitive skin and actually felt soothing. It took hours to ansorb into my skin and left a slightly greasy feel. I awoke this morning to very happy skin - hydrated, smooth, plump and slightly firmer. Once my current moisturizer is empty, I'll be purchasing. * This is my second time repurchasing. I hate the price but this has made a significant difference in my skin. I have sensitive dry skin and this has given my skin the moisture it needs and an amazing glow. I see others are complaining about it being ""greasy"" i havent had that issue. I apply two pumps to my skin and it gives me the most beautiful glow. I use everything Dermalogica and constantly get compliments on my skin. * This is one of those products that's been life changing in my routine. The way my under eyes look & feels from this product is phenomenal. This has helped with my fine lines and wrinkles. Helped firm my under eyes. Super rich lux formula. A little goes a long way.

Its lightweight but still moisturizes well! I haven't experienced any skin tightness nor have i had any irritation or sensitivity. Ive been using the facial wash from this specific line for a few years and have recently added this and the serum to my routinen. My skin is acne prone and is oily/combo and it seems to really love this line so far. Hoping for good results. * Bought about 3 or 4 times. Great product, light weight hydrating and doesn't leave a weird sticky residue. Would recommend buying for others that want nice glowy skin. * I love this stuff so much. I have very acne prone skin and this does not break me out. It may seem a little wet at first, but it absorbs really well for me! I have been using this for over a year and it has worked better than 
high-end stuff that I have tried. * I like to use this one during the day since it's lighter. This one helps balance my skin and gives my skin a nice glow. The othe one with the dark blue cap is what I use at night since that's when I choose to exfoliate. I also use the serum and the toner. * I've bought this moisturizer 3 or 4 times now!It's amazing for my acne-prone skin!

Definitely worth the money! * I have a strong appreciation for this cream, having used it for the past five years, and I intend to keep using it. It does not cause any irritation and is suitable for use in any weather conditions. Its texture is quite pleasant, and I would definitely recommend it to others. * This moisturizer did not absorb in to my skin and after a couple hours my skin felt dry and tight. It left a layer of cream just sitting on top of my skin. For the price, my skin should be at the very least moisturized * Fragrance is not good for the face, especially for skin of color. Fragrance is one of the leading causes of contact dermititis. It is otherwise a grear profuct, they just need to refomulate & remove the fragrance! * This is my first time using an Ester Lauder product and I'm really impressed. I never write reviews but honestly the improvement in my skin's uneven tone/hyperpigmentation and fine lines- especially on my neck, have  improved considerably.  I've been using for about 3 weeks now. It is a bit pricey but a little goes a long way with this moisturizer. Finally a product that lives up to what it claims to do!"

I also did not like the smell. * This has been my holy grail product for years.  People think I am 25 but am actually 39 and i think this cream has been a big help.  But since they have reformulated the product it is not the same, it's much thinner than it used to be, causes major irritation around my mouth and eyes and overall doesn't give me the same results.  I'm so disappointed but also want people to be aware that older raving reviews may be misleading now. * I'm 53 years old and have extremely dry skin, large pores, sensitive skin, acne and sun spots.  Yes, I'm a mess. My skin is so dry that, even with moisturizer on, I can't use any kind of face powder over my foundation because it will dry my skin out and cause it to peel. On top of that my pores are large and i have acne. 
I had been looking for a moisturizer like this for the last several years because my skin condition had worsened. I love this stuff!  I had tried so many different creams, lotions, serums and moisturizers. I had to spend time layering products on my face and still didnt get the kind of results the Peter Thomas Roth Ultimate Solution 5 lotion gives me. And its so concentrated that I don't have to use much of it so, while it's a tad pricey, it's so worth it. I purchased the travel size two weeks ago and it will last me another month-possibly more. * This product is very soft but it smells like chemicals. The smell lingers for a bit after applying. For the price and brand I was expecting better quality. * I am 61. I have very dry skin, especially in the winter. I have tried just about every product out there from oils to serums and various creams both high end (Clarins, Chanel…) and drug store brands and this is by far the best product I have ever used. * Use the PTR wash in shower on décolletage and neck with a facial teardrop shaped pouf, dry VERY well then apply this to neck and décolletage all your sun damage will be gone in 2 weeks. I've been using it consistently after every shower. I'm a shower every other day person and it's really really kept my chest beautiful, freckle free. I'm now on my 2nd XL jar and I'm splurging now to use more for my shoulders, for that sun damage too. I think this is too much for my particular face because I already use Dennis Gross acid products that and this would be way too many acids. I do think this lotion could take the place of all other acid products though. It's phenomenal. I'm buying two small sizes as gifts for Christmas! My 40's gals must have this. * This product pills constantly under make up and alone. I would return this if it wasn't past the return date"

It is winter here in the air is quite dry. My face does start to get dry as the day goes on with this on. I prefer something a little bit heavier that is non-greasy. I didn't notice any visible signs on any wrinkles. * The L'Oréal Revitalift Triple Power Moisturizer has a very rich texture. It does provide a lot of moisture to my skin. I have not noticed any scent during use. I would give it 5 stars if L'Oréal would include a spatula or something to get the cream out of the jar. For my combination skin, this cream works great for the drier colder months. I would need something lighter for the warmer humid months however. 
I did receive this product in return for an honest review. * Love how it exfolates and softens my face with added moisterizer. * I absolutely love this product. I am approaching mid 40s and I need the extra hydration. This sets in nicely, feels great on the skin as well as making my skin feel soft throughout the day, and being fragrance free is beneficial for my sensitive skin. Plus this doesnt break me out at all. The ONLY negative is the glitter shimmery aspect, not a fan. Even with the shimmer, I still bought two new jars after finishing my first one. * Been using for years!  Absorbs quickly, feel light on my face, yet I see a consistency in my skin, meaning no new lines or wrinkles.

I liked the absorption and moisture that lasted all night. Would recommend * It's expensive, but the effect is worth it. I have very dry, allergic skin. It is very difficult for me to find the right cream. Ultra repair helps me a lot. The texture is light, but it nourishes well. * 10/10 love this stuff. I was a little off put by the price of the 4oz jar, but dammit if it's not worth it. just a small nickel size amount and my hands have stayed moisturized overnight. I get a lot of cuts and scrapes on my hands and it doesnt bother a single one of them. my cuticles are also So Much nicer than they usually are and smoothed down vs their usual hard cracked dryness. * I live in the cascade range mtns and the winters here are dry and windy. Weleda was too thick, COSRX not thick enough. This has been a skin saver!! My skin is normally patchy with dry snakeskin spots, but i havent dealt with that in the 2 months using the product. I bought the 6oz jar in November, have a bit of a heavy hand with moisturuzer and this will probably last me until June. Great price for the amount, and its a no fuss moisturizer * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This is a nice moisturizer. Thick and covers well with minimal product. No greasy residue left behind. Plenty of product to last a long time in the jar. Leaves my skin feeling well hydrated and smooth. * This product has been fantastic for me during the brutal cold winter days that dry out my skin like leather in the desert.
This absorbs quickly but provides long lasting moisturization. * I got put onto the First Aid Beauty back in 2018 as a starter brand to skincare and I've never left. Anytime I have an eczema flair up around my eyes this is the only moisturizer that hasn't burned. I love this and the face wash too!"

I get so many compliments on my skin. It makes my skin glow and helps with my fine lines. * I've gotten so many compliments on my skin as soon as I started using this. It works really well with other products as well so it's the perfect ending to my am/pm skin routine. * I love this so much along with facelift and neck cream * Feels good and I look forward to my day and nightly routine now.  It's been 1 week and I already see and feel the changes in my skin. * I wish I would have bought multiples during the big sale. This cream is ideal as a night cream. It makes my skin soft, bright and plump. The consistency of this cream is also ideal for the neck area! This definitely my top 3 face creams. * I am almost 55 and this stuff is amazing. It pairs well with makeup and gives your skin a glow! I can't live without this product. Also, there is a definite noticable difference!!! I wish this was gifted- but this an honest opinion!!"

It is whipped and takes very little product for perfect protection and moisturizing.  Love it! * I love this for the colder weather moisturizer is nice and thick for those cold winter mornings with the benefits of vitamin C and sunblock. * I love how moisturizing this is but that where the good vibes stop. It smells like sunscreen and burns my eyes!  I use a separate eye cream so it shouldn't be getting into my eyes but some how it still does. I wish I could love it but I've found something less creamy that acts more like a primer and doesn't make my eyes burn and water all day 😢 * Makes my skin look beautiful! * And gave me a bad taste in my mouth. Going back to Mario Badescu. Not worth the extra sun protection. * This is a great one step. Works well for dry or combo skin. Love the texture. Its also THD Ascorbate. * nice"

It has minimal fragrance which is nice, and it feels smooth and rejuvenating. * I loved this product! It's sooo cooling and refreshing when it first touches your face. It literally just absorbs into your skin. I love it. It has a lovely, light scent. Highly recommend 😊 * This cream helped my daughter with the redness on her face. The texture is light weight and clean ingredients * I love Hope on a jar Water Cream with Hyaluronic Glow Moisturizer. The product feels so creamy and makes your skin feel and look soft with a glow. * I cannot go a makeup application without using this product.  A few years ago I was having issues with makeup landing in my pores.  An Ulta employee recommended this and I have used it ever since. * So refreshing. My skin looks so glowing and fresh, but never greasy and works great as a primer for make up truly a glass of water for my skin. * I just finished my first jar of the water cream hyaluronic glow moisturizer and I will be going back to Ulta to grab another one today.

Haven't experienced any breakouts or other issues since using. Skin is definitely more dewy and ""plump"" since I've started using this specifically * A little goes along way. It feels soft and not greasy in anyway. Love it. I am thankful the sales associate recommended it to me. I will definitely buy it again * This day cream feels lovely but is extremely overpriced. It feels exactly like Cerave moisturizing cream. * The cream wouldn't soak into my skin. It's very thick and waxy feeling. Perhaps I got an old product because it felt terrible on my skin like it would clog pores and it had a funky scent. * I have dry and dehydrated skin. The cream doesn't easily absorb into the skin at all, and it sits on the face hot and heavy. Really struggling to finish it. My husband is usually not picky, but he too doesn't like it at all. * I use the full Dime skincare line, and it's the best I've ever used. I'm 58 and needed a change about a year ago as I started to see changes in my skin. I also wanted to start using a clean product line. I found Dime, and it's been amazing. The Dewy Day cream is in fact dewy! I often start applying this and hear myself say outloud, ""Ahhhh."" It just feels so good going on and does it's job well. Perfect for daytime and under makeup. * I dislike fragrances and for some reason, it is difficult to find skincare without it.
This brand is my new go-to.  It is light, dewy, and does what i need it to do.  I also love the price."

It has a weird, (gritty?) texture and doesnt apply or absorb into your skin well. When you try to rub it in, it pills and you can see it roll off your skin. I accidentally got some on my lips & it has an rancid sour taste. It irritated/burned my skin so I had to wipe it off & put something else on. Glad I only had a free sample & didn't purchase a big bottle of it but very disappointed to say the least. * The new packaging comes with broken pumps making the product useless. Do not buy! * I was given this product to try. Now Im back to purchase it as I can't imagine going without it. It's my favorite part of my morning routine.  The pump puts out the perfect amount of this creamy goodness and it goes on so easy. It does have a slight gritty feel that smooths into your skin. It did tingle abit in the beginning which reassured me it was working. My skin was in horrible condition.  Once I put this on, my skin becames firmer, looks brighter and is so smooth even my husband noticed. Its my favorite skin care product. I question some of the negative reviews on here as my experience is the complete opposite. I'm so addicted to this C serum I even recommended this product to my mom. * Not even halfway through bottle and pump broke. Product was good unfortunately a waste of money if it's unusable. Will not be purchasing again * Title says it all. It does brighten but does sting a bit as you begin using. The main issue I have with it is tje gritty texture when applying (which can be helped by adding something moisturizing after), BUT this stuff pills like no other, I can easily roll it all off my face even hours after application. This was a no from me. * The way my skin feels after applying is amazing.  After just a short week of use, I am loving how smooth my skins feels and have received numerous compliments on my face and skin! * I LOVE this product for a specific reason. I thought this would be a good eye cream, but the texture is a little matte so I've been using it as an under eye primer and it makes my makeup look so good. It blurs out my fine lines and I look more rested"

Light and moisturizing but not heavy. * This lightweight moisturizer was good enough but the smell/fragrance is SO strong. It's surprising for an Avene product. I will not repurchase. * I love MOISTURE! I wish I could put this all over my body. I little goes a long way and  it completely covers my face with delightfuly dewy hydration. * This product is HEAVILY scented snd burned my sensitive skin. Its a no for me. * This moisturizer does hydrate but there's some pretty big cons. 
-Not for oily skin. Leaves the skin very oily a few hours after application.
- Not non comedogenic. Caused a lot of new breakouts.
- Fragrance is strong * I got this in a travel size in a gift set and was excited to use it on a long weekend trip. As soon as I opened the packaging, I was hit with the aggressive smell of this product and was transported back to my grandmother applying her heavily scented products in my youth. Since I had no other moisturizer with me, I used it and my combo acne prone skin informed me that I had offended it with the noxiously scented product. My skin was irritated and my husband, who has the worst sense of smell ever, could smell this product through a couple layers of product.

So needless to say, I do not recommend this product."

It's only the second retinol-family product I've used, so I'm not sure if this is typical or not, but I couldn't get over it. I love Avene and I'm sure it's effective, but if you are sensitive to smells, too, maybe not for you. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I enjoyed this product and I'll post a deeper review once I've finished my other product and can really focus on this one. I didn't notice any redness or peeling. I think that as far as Retrinal, this is a good starting product. No overwhelming scent. Very happy with this product. * After a week of use, I noticed a difference in my skin. I have dry skin, and I feel like it moisturizes enough without being greasy. I'll continue using it. * Recibí este producto a cambio de mi revisión honesta. I got this cream and my husband has been using it and it has worked very well on his face he is very happy I recommend it too much the packaging is very good and just like the product the texture the aroma is very good quality * I received this product in exchange for my honest review. It gently smooths the appearance of wrinkles and gives my skin a firmer look without causing any irritation or discomfort. The formula feels high quality. My complexion looks brighter, more even, and plumper. I love that it's fragrance free. I apply it each evening to my face, neck, and decollete. * This ends up changing color to dark pink and then I have to throw it out.  What a waste of money * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This product is light and goes on very nicely. I've been also using on my elbows and chest to get some added benefits. Would definitely recommend this brand!"

I copied the list of it's ingredients and asked if they were safe/clean and if the sunscreen was mineral based. The response was that the ingredients are safe but that it is not a sunscreen because it does not contain any Sun protection ingredient, mineral or not. * This is the only sunscreen I will ever use. As a Hispanic woman, it's hard to find a sunscreen that won't leave a white cast. This. IS. IT. It melts right into my skin no problem & I can layer makeup on top of it with no pilling. 100/10. * I live in Arizona and this product has been so wonderful! I don't need a lot and sometimes I apply a second time in the middle of the day and my skin feels great. * Leaves your skin glowy and hydrated * I like the texture of it & it is SPF 40 in it. But I don't like the that is make my face oily and my make-up does not last. * this used to be my favorite moisturizer of all time. it was thick, glowy and completely smoothed the texture of my skin like no other. i restocked in march 2025 after not purchasing since 2024 and the product i received can only be summarized as garbage. it smells different, its a much lighter consistency (which i want to note is a BAD thing in this case) and the glow on this lasts about only 10 minutes before seeping in and my skin goes back to dull. i have super (SUPER) dry skin and this product used to be the only moisturizer that actually worked. i'm sad to say that what they're selling now is not the same moisturizer it used to be. if you're reading this in 2025 hoping you've found your new favorite moisturizer, KEEP LOOKING. THE NEW FORMULA OF THIS IS NOT IT! * I'm new to the Supergoop product line and  I really needed this Superscreen to work for me. And voila! It did! I have sensitive skin, both oily and dry if that makes sense. This product goes on smoothly, blends in vs. typical sunscreens that never seem to soak into the skin. I will say I noticed a pretty strong scent of sunscreen when I first opened it. Now, just a few days later, I don't notice it at all. I love how this makes my skin feel hydrated but not oily. And it lasts all day. I apply once in the morning after washing my face and same routine at night."

I had to switch to the Aveeno gel moisturizer which is similar to the old formula * My skin broke out in a rash, it was so disappointing. Maybe some will like it, not me. Thankfully got my money back. * I really loved it. It's very smooth on the skin, and my skin absorbs it well, keeping my face hydrated and looking healthy. I love that! The only downside is that the bottle is a bit small, so if they offered a larger size, I would definitely consider buying that. Other than that, I absolutely love it, and it's really affordable! * This is a good product for lightweight hydration. I love the gel-cream texture, how it absorbs into the skin, and how it isn't greasy. Most of the time, this was an effective product, however I felt that on very cold days when my skin was incredibly dry, I needed something else as well. I would purchase the full-size, however it is a little expensive. * This made me break out! I'm glad I figured out it's this! Had to throw mine away. * This was a good moisturizer and felt lightweight on the skin. Felt very similar to the Tula Dew Your Thing moisturizer. I never woke up with any breakouts when I used this at night. However, I don't know if this would be suitable for somone with acne as I feel like it does just sit on the skin. * So many people like this product but i dont know why. I put it on and it feels nice at first but then within the hour I'm dry again and its like i didnt put any moisturizer on at all. I tested this out for 2 weeks and my face feels rough, its like this ruined the texture. So weird."

I LOVE IT!!! It blends GREAT (especially for a product with SPF), isn't greasy, doesn't make my skin oily or shiny, has not caused a breakout, and I can see a clear difference in the moisture level of my skin in just a few days. Anti-aging creams normally make my skin totally freak out, but this one is all good, no bad. Really glad I happened upon it! * This contains Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene....FYI * I joke that this is my old lady face cream because it smells like a bouquet of roses. However, it really does give the skin a lifted appearance and tightened feel. The daytime version has some SPF and wears nice under makeup. I wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin because of the fragrance. Also, I noticed on very dry winter days the product does not have enough moisture for my skin * I received this as a sample size from Estee Lauder and I can't wait to buy a full size. This is why I love samples, It lets me fiind out what I love without spending a fortune first.  It has the faintest fragrance that is subtle but lovely. It goes on so smooth and is just pleasant to use. My only complaint is the price. Some of us would buy this brand more often if we weren't priced out of the market. This is why I gave it a four. Otherwise, a five all the way. * This smells like febreeze and it doesn't go away when you rub it in :( save your monies * I use this product daily.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. It did not irritate my skin, which can sometimes be an issue for me.  Makeup base glides on smoothly over this moisturizer.  It is my absolute favorite. * I wish I could use this product as it seems to work well. However the fragrance is too strong and irritating."

For this price there must be something better out there! * I use this morning and night along with the face and eye serum (same brand) followed by sunscreen (only in the morning). I can truly say that this stuff along with the face and eye serum works. I used to have very dry skin, but not anymore. Also, the hormonal acne I get occasionally is under control. Lastly, the wrinkles are diminishing. Totally worth every penny. * I see smoother skin , brighter skin , less fine lines and an overall younger look * I do love this product, it's true to all things advertised - A little bit goes a long way as I purchased this a few months ago and still have more than half of it left. I did not want to write a review until I was certain I was satisfied based off of the huge expense... 

that said, I wish the product was a bit less expensive because I have tried other product lines that do the same job without the extra $$... but then again, you are paying for the name"

I'm never without it! * I bought the travel size when it was BOGO because it is very expensive.  I did not want to spend money on the full size not knowing if I'd like it.  So far, so good.  I've only used it one week.  My skin looks a bit better after one week's use.  I just might pop for the larger size.  I would suggest people buy the mini size when a product is BOGO.  If you try one container and don't like it, you can give the other to a friend.  You have not spent a small fortune to just try something. * During the winter my face became dry and flaky with more pronounced wrinkles. This reversed that! It also absorbs easily. This will be my go to year round. * I recently moved from somewhere that is constantly hot and humid to a place with real winter. This moisturizer is a game changer! I was starting to get cracked dry skin all over my face and within 4 weeks of regular nightly use my skin looks and feels fantastic. It's the perfecr winter moisturizer. * I do love the product however the design needs to be changed too much waste in a pump design * This is the best facial moisturizer ever!

Im very picky about moisturizers and I don't think I'll ever stop repurchasing this one! * The texture takes some getting use to but this product is so hydrating. My skins is glowing and supple when I use this moisturizer. I use it at night in the summer. Great for day and night in the winter months! * Thick, moisturizing but not heavy, plays well with other products and never breaks me out. I come back to this over and over * My skin gets extremely dry in the winter and a lot of products tend to clog my pores and make me break out in certain spots, but not this one. Its so moisturizing, velvety, and has helped my skin so much in the winter months. Will definitely be buying again! * If my face is going haywire in terms of  acne, this cream fits my skin as it doesn't lead to **additional** breakouts. The cream is thicker consistency, so all I do is take spatula of the amount I need for face & neck, then I do dots of the cream all around my face and finally pat it in. Similar method to tret where you use smaller amount and apply dots across the face. * My biggest complaint is that I found it to be a little too thick to the point I felt like i was tugging on my skin to get it to rub in all the way. Didnt notice a difference in skin texture or appearance after using almost the entire jar. * This product pills no matter how i apply it! I dont think skincare should be so tedious to apply."

Until it did. It eventually left my face irritated and reactive to my favorite toner and emphasized the texture on my face. I wouldn't recommend! * At first when I got this I thought it would be great cleanser the only reason this gets 2 stars is because it foams but for the price and ingredients I dont recommend it has parabems and costs more then its worth and I broke out and I dont normally break out. * Light, no scent.

I'm likely allergic to one of the botanicals. * This product us extremely overpriced and youre not getting a facelift ftom it. I got to try this for free and after attempting to make if work with cream, powder and liquid foundations, threw it away. It's not make up friendly. Why people buy this expensive product is beyond me. * I was excited to try this based on the positive reviews. There was one that mentioned a hollow center air bubble. Well, I got an air bubble. The entire center of the jar was hollow, making the jar far less full than it should be.  Fresh has to work on this. It's a disappointment. The cream is nice though. * My husband and i are 35, i take care of myself but he never uses anything on his face! He started getting bad wrinkles on his forehead and made him use this for a few days. Just in 4 days i saw a huge difference!!! * My skin is glowing ever since I added this cream into my regimen. * Best face location I have come across. A bit pricey, but well worth it. It's not thick, and doesn't leave a residue.

Non-reactive on my sensitive skin and feels wonderful on.  I believe it has made a difference in the texture of my skin and improved my neck wrinkles. * Finding the right skin care routine is never linear since it varies person per person. I have sensitive combination skin and I always struggled to find a product that didnt give me that greasy glow. 

This product is light yet hydrating enough that it doesnt require a lot of product. While the price tad is high, the big container last me 2-3 months depending on the weather. 

I would recommend you get a sampler size and try it out for 3 months because you wont see any instant results. After 6 months of using this product, it cleared my blackhead and slowly seeing results in other areas. * I have been using this multi corrective face cream since its arrived on the market, Im 52, it has been a game changer since i traded up from their daily moisturizer( in which i stared at 30. It doing what it needs to do, im not getting wrinkles or dry skin and i use it alone & under make up. I'm often asked if im 35 so i have to give some credit to kehls for it. I love the line, its fine quality and i will never waver! * I bought this after many great reviews. I used it around 10 times and thought it was sunburn because I was red and sore.

I hoped the reviews were wrong, but it definitely leaves a white cast over your skin, and made me look super pale, despite the fact that I have a fair, medium skin tone. * I have tried almost every mineral sunscreen under the sun. I'm fair skin, freckles, burn easily, break out easily and this sunscreen moisturizer has been amazing. There is a white cast initially but I rub the product between my fingers before applying and it blends within 5 minutes! I never get sunburn on my face while wearing this. I also apply a ceramide barrier serum beforehand and do not experience any dryness while using this product. Would absolutely purchase a cool toned tinted version of this."
170,neutrogena,"hydro boost hyaluronic acid water gel moisturizer, fragrance free",pimprod2041883,2615397," * This is the first time trying a lip mask from neutrogena. I love their make up wipes and their sunscreen, but their body lotion always made me itch. I like that this lip mask can be worn day and night, but that its also fragrance free, no tingle, and its not crazy thick. I wish the applicator was a doe foot, its difficult to get out the first time * Didn't break me out but also did not work, I felt almost more dry when I used this. Instead I switched back to niacinamide from the ordinary, my skin feels great with that moisture wise. * These are the only makeup remover wipes I use. I have tried others, more expensive, but have always returned to the neutrogena.makeup wipes. My eyes are sensitive so I love how they  glide smoothly over my eye lids without pulling. If these are on sale I stock up! * I got these on a coupon deal, so i used. Normally i use makeup wash cloths- so much more easy, washable, exfoliating, and no chemicals. I made the worst mistake getting the original! These burned my face like no tommorow- especially around my eyes. The sensation and rash was insane. BUY FRAGRANCE FREE IF NEED TO PURCHASE! The scented- original ones also left a weird greasy slimy film/residue all over where wiped. The package is also faulty upon pulling tab- sliced it in half so you couldnt close. Would have put these in a baggie to save them, but being their literal hotspot wipes for your face; to the trash they went! * I have beeb using this wipe for several years. I usualy only need one to remove basic make, and 3 max for heavier faces. After moisterizing my skin, it is clean and smooth for bedtime. * Its not a makeup remover i dont know what people are saying. ITS MOISTURIZER. It works so well my only issue is. It feels slightly sticky so use a little maybe at a time in areas and dont!! Touch your face. It works amazing i have combo acne prone skin and one day it was super dry like peeling kind of ? And i picked this up and its amazing the best moisturizer ive tried. The price is a little much but worth it. Compared to a super cheap brand you could choose to buy this is amazing. Try it especially if your skin is like mine and its not really sensitive. * These should have been taken off the shelves with the recall. I used them 2x when traveling and had this horrible reaction both times when my normal Neutrogena wipes don't have this issue. Because of the limited usage I didn't realize the source the 1st time. When I opened the package it deflated which is the only sign of an issue, they smell normal. Took a week to heal last time and I'm on round 2 now hoping I fight the bacteria without serious infection. Eyes are swollen, itchy, watering, and red."

172,honest beauty,hydrogel cream,pimprod2015205,2566810," * I have used it for a few weeks, it doesn't seem to provide long term moisture. It is nice that it avoids the chemicals I avoid, but I wish it did more good. * I have had this hydrogen cream for awhile and everything I use it, it just feels sticky and greasy. It does not go on the skin smoothly. It leaves a greasy sticky residue on my fingers. Since using it, I have not seen or felt any skin benefits. I have stopped using this and prefer my Elemis collagen spf cream instead. * Only moisturizer that doesn't stuff up my nose. I tried clinique also and couldn't use it. Love their products. * New favorite! Absolutely love how the texture of this moisturizer changes as you rub it in. It melts down almost like water, really feels like your skin took a huge drink of H2O. It does take a while to sink in though, so if dewy finishes aren't your thing I'd pass on it. Best for nighttime use. * Better than the expensive stuff by a landslide. Ive been using this and gifting this to family and friends for many years. Nothing compares. * I have combination skin. This did not break me out. I love how the texture changes once you start to rub it in. However, i wish it absorbed into the skin more completely. My skin feels tacky after using this, so my hair sticks to it. Oversll good tho! * This was recommended by a black dermatologist over a year ago.  I use it in combination with the vit C serum, any Vit C serum will work.  I absolutely LOVE the way this both looks and FEELS on my skin.  It works great with my various varieties of sunscreen, and I've never loved how great my skin looks so much. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
173,la roche-posay,toleriane rosaliac anti-redness face moisturizer for sensitive skin,pimprod2038740,2610275," * Love the way my skin feels and looks.  Only takes a little bit. * Did not find thid very moisturing nor did it elimate my redness very much.  I actally preferred my cheap Elf Holy Hydration I bought not too long ago.  But, maybe it would work better on a different skin type?  In any case, I took it back, I don't have enough storeage space or money for products that don't do much. * I've gone through 3 or 4 bottles of this. Works so well for my rosacea. However, the pump stops working when about a fourth of the product is remaining. I have to break it open in order to get full use of what I paid for. * I bought this to help me use less makeup to cover up redness. While it does reduce the appearance of redness, it pills under all of the makeup I have tried, causes separation and caking and lift. I tried it with 6 different foundations, skin tints and bb creams and all of them resulted in the same terrible texture, clinging to dryness and imperfections. * I've struggled for a while with my roseaca and was on a mission to find something, and this helped right away. I noticed a huge difference in the first week. I go through my face routine with CeraVe facial soap and toner then follow up with this. If you haven't tried it yet I recommend 10000%. everyone's skin is different so it can be frustrating finding what works for your skin. * I started using La Roche-Posay face wash and moisturizer about 6 months ago, and has been great for my skin. My face is softer, less shiny, and my pores are smaller/less noticeable, but I still have some dry red spots on my cheeks. Even adding extra moisturizer doesn't help. I had high hopes for this product, but it was not a good fit for me. Despite the fact that green is supposed to cancel out red, the green really stood out on cheeks and I had to rub and rub and rub to try and get it to absorb and not be noticeable. Within about 10 minutes, my cheeks felt hot and dry, and I ended up wiping the product off with a cool, damp towel. The texture of the product was nice, and there was no scent, which I appreciated, but it just didn't work for me. * This has definitely calmed my rosacea flare at a fraction of the cost for products at the dermatologist and it fits in perfectly with my skin care routine"
174,tula,protect + plump firming & hydrating face moisturizer,pimprod2019788,2571139," * This is the absolute WORSE skin care product I've ever purchased for my face.  It is extremely over priced and delivers 0.0 of the results it claims to.  It does not plump, protect, or hydrate.  It also doesn't smell great tbh.  I'm convinced it's an artificial product with a fancy label.  Money making scam 100%! * I love the the way my skin looks and feels I can totally tell the difference. My skin is hydrated. * product smells awful!!! * Tried this moisturizer because i love the cleanser, but its the total opposite. Unlike the cleanser which is light, smells great and leaves skin feeling fresh, this moisturizer is thick, feels heavy on your face, and smells like artificial fruit. Also, the pump is terrible. * This moisturizer is absolutely amazing! My face is so soft and hydrated, I couldn't believe it. The smell is light and fruity. I'm so happy I gave it a try. * Though I do love the way this lotion feels on my skin, I won't purchase this again unless the packaging changes. It feels cheap and only works about 2/3 of the time. The scent of the lotion also takes some getting used to. * I like the feel on my skin. It has a lot of moisture in it and my skin looks good when using.  I get a lot of compliments regarding my skin"

Am 80+ years old and everyone can't believe it. * I love this product.  I have been using it now for several months.  My skin feels so hydrated now and my make-up looks so much smoother when applied.  I will continue to us it.  Thanks to the nice person at Ulta who introduced this product to me. * This cream is so good. You feel the richness in the cream when you apply it on your face. It is deeply moisturizing and not light like some other creams. I love it, definitely recommend * This smells wonderful! It has a nice consistency and absorbs quickly without disappearing. It is on my repurchase list. * Have tried various moisturizers different brands and price ranges. This one by far the best one ive tried and the only one to proivde consistent results. * This cream makes my sensitive skin soft and smooth. I usually get dry flaky areas in the winter and I have none with this cream so far! The Hope moisturizer made me break out, but this did not. I will never be without it. * Bought this when it was on sale. Smells like plato but it did help with fine lines and felt moisturizing on my skin! My skins on the dryer side and this one would be good for normal-oily imo. The smell does go away after applying bjt it leaves a  great glow. Id get a lot of compliments going out not long after application"
176,coola,refreshing water cream spf 50,pimprod2021554,2575597," * I love everything about the sunscreen except for the wasteful packaging. I feel like I can get a bit more out of it if the packaging was maybe in a tube or something. However, It's glowy, it doesn't leave a white cast on brown skin, it doesn't have a strong fragrance, it's very hydrating. I love that is SPF 50 UVA and UVB with broadrange sun protection I make sure to stock up when it's on sale. Cosmetic chemist approved. * I wanted to love this product, especially since i love the scalp SPF spray they have. But this makes my face feel icky, even being a water based cream. It also leaves a weird lingering smell, cant really explain it. * The consistency is great, a super light watery cream and smells like a faint coconut smell. It feels really greasy after a while and I don't think it really helped with bluelight ? Idk hard to tell, as far as under makeup I did not like, it never sunk in. 
I would use it if it was the only sunscreen available near me but wouldnt re purchase or grab for it on my own. * The consistency is great, a super light watery cream and smells like a faint coconut smell.

I would use it if it was the only sunscreen available near me but wouldnt re purchase or grab for it on my own. * I'm so happy to receive these products from BeautyTap. This was the first time I've used a moisturizer by Coola. I've heard a lot about this brand and have always been curious about this company. Anyways this moisturizer was smooth, comfy, and lightweight on the skin. I love the fact it has sunscreen and it's a 2 in 1 product. This cream isn't too greasy on my skin and is easily absorbed, usually, when I wear sunscreen it is clear so I don't have to deal with a white cast and greasiness. My skin felt refreshed and awake when I used this. I love that it has water-like hydration, anti-pollution, and digital de-stress. These are some of the ingredients that I haven't in any other products before. Plus it is cruelty-free, vegan, and antioxidant-enriched. * I'm absolutely thrilled with this sunscreen, and I love that it's vegan, clean, and cruelty-free. One of the standout features for me is its incredibly lightweight texture, which leaves no white flashback or residue on my skin. It glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly, without any greasy or sticky feeling. Another huge plus is that it's fragrance-free, which is perfect for my sensitive skin. Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with this sunscreen and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality, eco-friendly option.""Product was received as part of an educational promotion."" * I LOVE this stuff! Very high SPF, and it's sanitary because it comes out through a pump at the top rather than needing to stick your fingers in a jar. I have ~normal to slightly dry skin, and I LOVE the moisture and glow it gives, without or with makeup on top. I do wish there was a way to open it at the end to get the remaining product that the pump won't squeeze out though.. otherwise 5/5 fully recommend. I even love the scent as it has a hint of the suncreen smell but not too much."
177,roc,retinol correxion max daily hydration creme,pimprod2002111,2534774," * Love this product for day and night use * I tried using this 10 times using the directions but each time the next morning, I would wake up & my face especially nose & skin next to nose was so red. It looked like a major sunburn. * I have the most sensitive acne prone skin on the planet, and this works perfect for me.  In fact, my acne cleared up a lot after I started using it.  Fades fine lines fantastically.  Not drying, fragrance free, and price is great!  Wear sunblock if you use this.  You will not regret this purchase!!! * This moisturizing cream is light as a feather yet provides lots of hydration. I also love that it is unscented. I haven't been using it long enough to see results such as fewer or less sever wrinkles but I'm hopeful. * This is a great size and works so great. My skin is more youthful and softer. I love the roc brand . This I used for a month and I feel my skin looked more plumper. It stays all day works great under your makeup.No smell also leaves no residue behind. Sinks into your skin very fast. I definitely recommend this. The price is great for this big of bottle. * I received this product as part of a #pinchme free trial and am happy I did. I have combination skin but dry more often than now. Also starting to develop fine lines. This creme not only made my skin feel smooth and hydrated, but also looks more radiant. * While I received a free product from RoC, I definitely am not being compensated for this and wanted to share that I did love the product. The retinol correction max daily feels amazinng on my skin and my skin overall feels softer and more supple after using it for a month. I didn't notice any changes the first 2 weeks but after a full month, I am loving how my skin is feeling."

It doesn't cover anything. It is grainy, patchy, orange, and does nothing helpful * This new formula is one hundred percent unusable. It doesnt cover my redness or acne at all and it makes me so sad because I loved this in lieu of foundation to give my skin a break. 

Really hoping they fix this asap because until then this is a waste of money and i refuse to buy it. * Left my face a weird orange color and looked greasy * New formula is just awful and does absolutely nothing besides make me oily. I have been begging for the old formula back for months. * Ive been using this stuff daily for years. The new formula is absolute garbage and doesnt cover anything. im returning it and needing to find a different product. Why change something thats not broken?"
179,cosrx,full fit propolis light cream,pimprod2017573,2568303," * not sticky at all and doesnt pill when layered with other things. great at hydrating while still being light. * I have a very hard time finding moisturizers for my dry sensitive skin. This is dewy and hydrating without breaking me out. My skin is less red and smoother after using this. Love it! * I absolutely love this moisturizer! It's light & feels very hydrating. I love the dewy finish on my skin, but I wouldn't recommend for oily girls. This has Propolis at the very top of the ingredient list, so you know you're getting all the benefits for an affordable price. Not to mention it's fragrance free! I pair this with a peptide eye cream & it has diminished my fine lines * In lieu of my 5 star rating, this product sadly ended up in my ""can't use"" category. I absolutely loved EVERYTHING about the whole Propolis line, but unforturnately Propolis is an allergen tested during an allergy patch test and mine showed a trace reaction which my allergist informed me to avoid any allergens even if it is only a trace. This could be an issue for people who have sensitive skin. I have to say that other than being a possible irritant or allergy to some, this moisturizer is a really great consistency and lives up to all the expectations that it claims to have. As with any product that is new to your skin, proceed with caution and do a patch test. Its worth knowing :) * I love the toner and serum in this line but for whatever reason this lotion is just waaay too much for me. It would irritate my exzema and cause small/minor breakouts. I have dry/reactive/acne prone skin so moisturizers are a challenge for me * My skin loves it! My pores look smooth, its calming & hydrating without looking greasy. A little goes a long way. * I LOVE THIS! My skin took around a week to really settle into this as my face reacts to new things. However once i got into the routine of using this, my pores look smooth, my skin is plump, and is overall hydrating without looking greasy. It also calms down the redness I have on my cheeks. A little goes a long way. I finally found a moisturizer that works for me."

Will continue using. * I recommend this moisturizer 100% it feels so smooth on your face. * I suffer from very dry skin, might be eczema. I was hopeless before stumbling upon this product. It saved my skin!! It makes me glow and doesn't clog my pores. SO glad I found this. Can't wait to buy more from this brand * I am currently pregnant, and this face moisturizer is the only one that truly works for me. It's gentle on my skin, doesn't clog my pores, and keeps my skin hydrated all day. I absolutely love it. * I live in the desert so between the dry air and hard water, my skin is always itchy and dry. I've tried several different moisturizers for my face and they never last for more than a few hours. This product though leaves my skin feeling moisturized for a whole day, without being greasy. This is my go-to moisturizer now, will buy this over any other product. Skin type dry! * This is the third or fourth time I buy this item and I love it please keep it in store. * Used it already for 3 days day and night and my skin within 1 day of using a product lets me kno YES OR NO if you ever used ponds the texture is about the same but goes on super thin its amazing love love love"

This cream is WONDERFUL for my dry skin; the texture is nice, the scent is light, and it goes great under my makeup (regardless of whether I give it time to completely soak in it just go straight from moisturizer to foundation). * I have very dry skin, It's hard for me to find the right moisturizer for my face. This moisturizer is the best and worked wonders for my skin. I am absolutely in love with it and I will definitely use it in future. Lightweight, good texture, pleasant smell and overall great for skin. I'm so happy this became a part of my skin care routine. I use as makeup base and this hides my pores leaving skin much moist and smooth to apply any foundation flawlessly, not too thick and had the right amount of moisture. it has the perfect consistency that I really loves, not too thick or too runny. The fragrance is not strong and it feels very pleasant. ""I received this product for free from MAC Cosmetics for testing and review purposes."" * I have Roscea, I've been using this cream for 2 weeks. I use the Aruna 77+ toner, then apply thos cream. My face looks better, it isn't as red, my skin looks healthier. I use it twice a day. My makeup goes on smooth. 

Try It!!!!! * This truly is like butter. It's so soft and gentle to spread on your face. * I love the way this looks and feels. I wish Mac would make a fragrance free version as this irritates my skin. Remove the fragrance and you would have more consumers imo. * I really like this moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. I have dry skin that gets worse in the winter, but by day three, I noticed a significant improvement and felt much less dryness. * I love this moisturizer. I use it daily as my skin prep before makeup. It keeps my skin so hydrated under foundation!!"
182,origins,ginzing energizing gel cream with caffeine + niacinamide,pimprod2033869,2598935," * I normally love origins products, but this one is unusable for me. I really wanted to like this product but when I put it on, it's so sticky. It feels like I'm putting honey on my face. My skin doesn't feel good with it on, and after using it for 3 to 4 weeks hoping I would get used to it, II'm throwing it away. I just put some on about three minutes ago and my skin still feels sticky to the touch and it feels dry under sthe stickiness, and like it's being pulled. * Goodbye 30's and hello puffy eyes in the morning, ugh! Or worse, if you spent the night crying because your teenagers are jerks or you watched that stupid commercial that brought out all the feelings. This gets rid of the puffy and eyes feel amazing! This is the only product I have found that actually gets rid of puffy eyes and doesn't cost $$$$. I love their brightening cream as well, but it doesn't get rid of the puff. * I have been using the eye cream for a while and wanted to try the full face gel. It is amazing!  My skin has a healthy glow and it is not heavy. Feels like a drink of water to my skin. My skin is very sensitive and have had no issues. It is so healthy I stopped using foundation entirely. * Enjoy using * I used this product for a few good years. Worked well with my oily/sensitive skin and absorbed really well and smells good. After the ingredient change, it just doesn't feel the same. It feels tacky on the skin and can rub off. * After reading reviews realized i wasnt the only one with this problem, it pills / rubs off. I do like everything about this, the texture, scent, way my skin looks after using but unfortunately the pilling aspect of it isnt worth the moisturizer overall so ultimately wouldn't recommend:( * This gel cream is amazing, I love it! Does exactly what it says it does."
183,peach & lily,rescue party barrier comfort cream,pimprod2042702,2617478," * Great morning moisturizer! I will be using this for ever * I have oily, very picky skin and this cream works so well for me. It's helped repair my skin barrier and keeps my face hydrated without making it greasy. My skin feels calm, balanced, and healthy after every use. Highly recommend if you're oily but still need moisture. * it's moisturizing, it's artificial fragrance free, it's calming... but it smells SO bad. only can be described as ""rancid playdough"". I did check the batch code, not expired, and newly opened.  this one's not for me. * This went on non-absorbing and it smells like a rancid bag of potato chips. 

It didn't do anything for my skin either 

thankfully, I only had a trial tube of it, but it is disgusting.

In the trash it goes. * Not a bad product but not great either, just had high hopes for someone with very dry chapped skin. I ended up only using it like 3 times thinking it would help my dry patches. It only irritated my skin more so I stopped using which is odd considering its suppose to restore the skin barrier.  I'm using the oil cleanser too and it doesnt help much either. Maybe the brand just isnt for me! F24 with pale and sensative skin. Hope this helps. * Along with the serum from this line, anytime another products from a different brand messes up my skin, I always come back to this cream! It is on the thicker side so it is best to use at night but you WILL see  amazing results! I personally like the consistency being on the thicker side especially for the creams that I use at night. Only warning is that it smells like playdough. * Bought this product having high hopes. Product has a strong cardboard/ paint smell. In my opinion the product is not worth the price."
184,osea,atmosphere protection cream,pimprod2017698,2570072," * I have clear non sensitive combo but very congestion and blemish prone skin so as much as I love natural brands it is very much a hit and miss. They are such quality formulas on paper however the excessive use of oils and butters leaves them causing issues for anyone remotrly congestion prone. While I loved this for a night or day moisturizer being so light milky yet amazingly hydrating absorbing effortlessly as if a water serum and leaving the best natural soft non greasy finish it ended up giving me endless red breakouts I have no doubt per all the algae and sea based ingredients plus oils that are a 50/50 chance of breaking out anyone acne prone. Happy for anyone these this product works for but sadly not me as I had hoped so much loving the mission of this brand and back to my staple Kbeauty brands that never fail me. I have loved Osea products but avoid their smoncare for years even with all the good reviews as had a feeling per their formulas they are majority not acne on congestion prone skin friendly per too many irritants even if natural and light formulas. Such a shame as adore the fresh scents and texture of this cream and their Ocean Wash but both wreaked havoc on my skin! * It feels super nice on the skin but it took so long to rub in which I didn't like. I wont be recommending this to my customers as a PBA at Ulta * I decided to buy this and try it out because I have heard awesome things about this brand and im OBSESSED! This is for sure going to be a staple in my house from now on! It smells like a baby and my skin is so soft! * Gives me HORRIBLE acne. Im not very acne prone but everytime I use this my face will breakout in unusual places for the next few days. * ive been using this since january 2024 & i love it so much! i got a free sample of the atmosphere cream and it def made me want the larger size. For referance i used to use the neutrogena hydroboost moisturizer haha this stuff is 10x better. Although it is a bit pricey I think its totally worth it. My skin glows like no other! I dont wear makeup so its important for my skin to be on 10 at all times. I also have combo skin and it doesnt make me feel oily or anything. Lastly, I bought the bottle at the beginning of April and its now Sept and ill probably buy another by the end of this month.. so the money goes a long way!! * I enjoyed using the product, the packaging is really good. It has a really nice smell without being strong. The only thing I don't like is that it's a bit pricey for the quantity. * They changed the formula and the smell is completely different. I used to love this product because it smelled like a spa. The new formula also does not feel as rich on the skin. This will be my last bottle. Too pricey and it is near impossible to get the last 1/4 of the product out of the jar,"

Good alone or under makeup. * Clarins is the best products for my super sensitive skin! * The smell is good, The lightness of the cream is amazing and it makes my skin feel like new, very refreshing! * I have used another brand for over 30 years, which I really like but, they keep upping their prices and I can't justify using it any longer. I am 75 years young and  have always had sensitive skin issues. This product is wonderful!  Feels great on my skin, no stickiness and my makeup looks so fresh; this moisturizer does everything the other brand did for me but at a more affordable price. This is my new go to moisturizer! * I got a sample of this cream and ordered it that very day. It is creamy and works well with or without makeup. * My skin is sensitive to breakouts. Usually when I use a very hydrating cream, I get pimples all over. This is the only cream that consistently gives me amazing results. No breakouts ever and applies like butter - super luxurious feeling (been using for a year now). So many other popular brands clog my pores badly. My skin stays clear with this and will continue to purchase for a long time. * i used this cream for months and it was perfect for my skin. Then they reformulate and now i can't use it al all. It gives me breakouts like I've never had before.  The same thing happened with the pink jar set."
186,peter thomas roth,firmx collagen moisturizer,pimprod2014564,2561084," * Im really surprised by the negative reviews. I got a sample of this cream ans love how my skin feels ans looks when i use it. The price is exorbitant and is the only thing keeping me from making it my usual night cream (i work in retail so it takea half a shift to pay for it). I'll jusy have to watch for sales! * I bought the collagen cream to replace collagen masks. I am very pleased with the results after just a few days. After cleansing and toning, I massage a small amount into my skin. I allow it to dry completly and then use Philosohy Miracle Worker face cream over top of it. This gives me smooth, glass skin all day. My skin texture has markedly improved since adding the collagen cream. It is key to properly massage the collagen cream in and letting it dry before adding the second cream. I do not wear makeup, so I cannot speak to how it would layer. * I was really excited to try this and after a few weeks notice no results. * Leaves my skin soft. Will repurchase * I blend this with the  prayer Thomas water drench sheet tint moisturizer. Blends great! Firms my skin and doesn't feel greasy or heavy.  I use this as a foundation.  Quite  expensive for the combo… but it works great with make up or just as a tinted moisturizer with mascara. * This is a great product and feels good on my skin, but I can't use it like other moisture products before applying my foundation because of pilling.. I now use only at night so I'm not putting anything over it. * I like it. I also drink collagen supplements so i think it works pretty well on top if it. Im only 23 so i dont have wrinkles to begin with but i will say that its pretty sticky going on and if you touch your face while its trying to dry than you will get the 'beads' like everyone else is saying but if you dont touch your face until its fully dry it will look normal"

Mild and fragrance free. SPF 21 sun protection.
Sooths, moisturizes, and protects. 
Perfect for sensitive skin. 
The only problem is that it is rather pricey. 
A product like that in a tube that size, should not cost any more than $30. * My husband uses this product and has me order it again and again as it provides a good moisturizer to his face and keeps him safe in the sun!!! * Loooooved this SPF moisturizer, it worked perfectly on my face and did a great job protecting my skin from UV rays all day, but after finding out how potentially harmful oxybenzone can be I stopped using it & switched to a Cetaphil moisturizer instead. Wish they'd reformulate it so I could go back to using it again. * I personally wasn't a fan of this product. First I want to point out the sales associates at Ulta are super sexist to men and I got passed multiple times every time I asked for help literally ignored me. But back to this product, it's very similar to sun screen I prefer a thicker face lotion like the 2-1 face & beard but that got discontinued. * After years of using Vasaline Intensive Care lotion on his face, I convinced him to try the Clinique For Men Broad Spectrum SPF21 Moisturizer.  He loved it!  For a lotion with sun scree, it's not greasy and  it absorbs into the skin nicely leaving no residue. * If you've ever had a reaction to a sunscreen this one probably contains your culprit. Wore once and broke out in a rash/hives where it was applied. I will now be avoiding oxybenzone."

It prevents and soothes a lot of winter cracking. * Best hand & body cream. I get cracks in my fingers & continual use of this helps to heel. * I have severely dry skin and this helped so much. It especially worked wonders on my hands.  It gives a really nice protection without leaving a greasy mess. I had a small one for my purse and gave most of it out while visiting relatives.  They all loved it too. * buy this, its great * My go to moisturizer, I even put my brother on to it and he's using strong acne prescribed medication. It does the job, it's not too heavy and layers nice under makeup. * I love this lotion my new favorite. Soaks in fast and moisturizing makes skin feel soft and supple. Super glad my reconstruction surgeon suggested this!!! * Product feels good at first, but I've noticed my skin is flaky the next day. I've never experienced that with moisturizers from other brands. I find it okay for body, but will avoid for face."
190,good molecules,bha clarify gel cream,pimprod2023936,2582314," * I could tell the difference in my skin instantly! * I have used all kinds of skincare and this has been the only skin care line that has cleared my skin up and kept it clear. I will always recommend using this product * I'm not sure why this happened if my skin is really good with salicylic acid in fact it prefers it then benzyl peroxide so I decided to try this out. I put it on overnight after my moisturizer as much as my pointer finger and I woke up the next day, my breakouts worse so I just stopped using it right then and there kind of disappointed was hoping for good results.🥺 * I love how it feels on my skin and i think it would add hydration to my skin. * My daughter tried the face wash and this gel and her face had a terrible reaction. No, no new foods or other items. She immediately began burning. Her face is like this on both sides and she has never had sensitive reaction to any other product. * I have dry, but clear skin. However, summertime + makeup = sweaty breakouts. So to stay on top of it, I started using this product once daily during my nighttime routine. Started working in just a few days of use. Now, instead of having several problem areas after a full day of wearing a full face of  makeup and sweating, I maybe have just small baby blemish that resolves itself overnight. It also does not dry out my skin more than it already is, if anything my skin has been feeling softer and more hydrated. I use La Roche Posay double repair moisturizer and it works well alongside it. With how well this has worked for me, I'm excited to try more products from them. Highly recommend! * i love this brand so much i've literally never been disappointed with any of their stuff but my makeup grips onto this like the hydro grip primer i am in love!! I've always had issues with layering and pilling no matter what i changed before but this product is crazy good and makes it easy, here to repurchase AGAIN. please good molecules never stop making this product and just try it especially if u have oily or combo skin"

Not bad and I'll still use until its gone however wont be a repeat purchase, it does feel nice on, its a bit thinner or more ""watery"" than I would usually like my moisturizers to be * I got this cream because my face broke out from a face mask. This cream reduced my redness and felt calming on my scaling skin. My face healed within a week of using this cream!! I will keep using this cream to reduce the redness on my cheeks. * My husband was struggling from some dry skin patches and irritation, a lot of face lotions seemed to make it worse but this did the trick. I love the jelly like texture and the redness reliefs is great for me. 10/10 recommend * Didn't reduce redness for me. Pleasant smell and made me look glowy. * This did nothing for my rosaceae. It's not greasy but it's one of those gel+lotion type things. It's an only ok moisturizer and did nothing for the red on my face. It's green tinted so color theory wise it should do something but it that's only if the green stays on top of the red, which being a moisturizer, it does not. 
would not buy again. do not recommend. * Hydrating did nothing for my redness * I would not recommend this product on rosacea skin types. When I first used this product, I felt a burning sensation and my skin started cracking. I really thought this product would help with my skin type but it does not unfortunately."
196,vanicream,facial moisturizer broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2042402,2619672," * this product aggravated my cystic acne and caused severe breakouts! Could be the squalane. Do not recommend * I bought this because the original (non spf) didn't pill my makeup, but I wanted sun protection. This feels thick and dry, which will not work over the winter. And my eyelids are BURNING. I'd read reviews that said it didn't sting, so got excited that this may finally be the sunscreen moisturizer that would work. Unfortunately, not for me. This is definitely a summer cream and not for eye skin, leaving that unprotected. * I've tried literally all the popular sunscreens, from EltaMd to high end luxury brands to clean beauty (Ilia, kosas,etc.), to Korean ones, the Vanicream SPF is by far the best one. It is moisturizing but not oily. The finish is beautiful without white cast! 0 breakouts too. Perfect sunscreen. I finally found the one! * This is the best facial sunscreen. I've been using it for years now. Slight white sheen after initial application but does go away after it absorbs. I pair it with CosRX snail mucin power essence moisturizer. My skin stays looking hydrated and dewy and still feels soft at the end of the day. * As goo as it gets on the market for non-nano zinc oxide sunscreens.

All truly mineral sunscreen are going to be zinc and have a light cast at minimum. This one is as good as it gets. I love it and I prefer knowing that sunscreen filters aren't getting into my bloodstream. * I bought this when I was struggling with extra dry skin and needed something rich. This did nothing but sat on top of my face and pilled with my other serums I had also bought to help with my dryness. I'm not sure who this would work for to even recommend it but if you do like it, I'm glad it works for you. * I'm surprised so many people are saying this is too greasy. For me it's actually kinda drying despite how thick it is. I'll try to finish it but wouldn't repurchase."

She and all of her friends use this ( plus another item i already left a review fir) I just got it yesterday, and have only used it twice. 
I told her I feel so fancy using a Lancome product. It is soft, it smells great, but not too strong, and my face had a glow to it this morning. Be careful getting any in your eyes. It will burn for the rest of the evening! So glad I did something for myself and bought this! * I like that it softens, does not pill, works with sensitive skin and it lasts awhile. * I have been using Lamcome Hydra Zen moisturizer for years and its amazing.  I have never had it ruin my face so I don't understand the negative comments left by other customers.  This product is top of the line and I wouldn't trade it for anything! * I like this face product, it gives nice fell fresh sensation… loved * This bottle seems a bit old. The smell is off. Not like my last few bottles. * This is a wonderful moisturizer. I have maturing skin, i am 50yo, and this is a perfect daytime moisturizer, light but very moisturizing.  It makes an awesome canvas for makeup or alone gice you a slight glow.  It works well with the other serums I use.  I use it daily every morning and at night i use the hydra zen cream. * I've been wearing this for about a couple years now. This is a must have. I do have the whole pink Hydra Zen collection. I do use the other products occasionally, the Rose Facial Scrub a couple times a week. I use Hyra Zen twice a day - morning and when i get home from work i wash my face and apply it again. I also been keeping it in the fridge lately and love it. I have gotten many compliments. I facetimed my brother one day - he said sis you look good! He said your skin looks great, what are you using lol. I laughed, thanked him, told him I have no makeup on, then told him I use Lancome Hydra Zen Glow but I put it on like 10-12 hours ago, like at 5am when I was getting ready for work lol  When I finally got home I put all the Lancome products I have together, took a pic and sent it to him."
198,clinique,clinique smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting rich face cream,pimprod2033121,2598028," * Used entire jar, as recommended. Saw zero difference. So sad. * It may not help the lines and aging affects on my fqc3 but the cream makes my face feel smooth, youthful and healthy. It may not be so but it feels good * I thought this was a great product and that the flushing on the neck and breakouts on the apple of my cheeks was due to rosacea. Nope. It was this cream. Under the sun with this cream it is even worse. 
Tricky part: not all my face was burning nor breaking out. And burning is not immediately after applying!
I stopped using this cream and my face is on its way to recovery. 
So, be aware. I read another comment stating kind of the same situation. I was actually going to reoder, but was curious about the 1 star reviews and finding ""that especific comment"" put an end to my nightmare. * I was going to reorder this product, but I was curious about the 1 star reviews and someone mentioned experiencing the same issues as me. 
Looking back at the date I started using this product ""THE RICH CREAM"" and doing the math I realized that this product causes rosacea-like symptoms. I was even flushing and sensitive to heat. Expose to the sun with this cream on was cooking my skin. Yes, I'm beating myself up, because I was actually thinking the whole time that this cream was helping me keep my skin moisturized at least. 

Here is the tricky part: not all my face broke out, felt hot or uncomfortable. My forehead, chin and nose were normal and moisturized by this cream. 

All symptoms were strong on the apple of the cheek (malar fat pad). Therefore, my dermatologist told me it was just rosacea.

Another tricky part; I didn't feel any stinging or burning immediately after applying. The symptoms were triggered with heat and moist. 

I can reasurre that the issue was this cream. I put it to test. 
I rarely leave reviews these days, but this whole situation was a nightmare to me and I hope I can help others. * One of my favorite products! * Light & fluffy ! It works well! * I wanted this to be good as I use Clinique daily moisterizer. Its hard to rub into your skin and peels up. Feels gross! Glad I biught the smallest size! Waste of money!"
199,peach slices,redness relief color correcting moisturizer,pimprod2037238,2605747," * This felt more like a tinted moisturizer than skincare & was separated when it was shipped so came out in a clear watery consistency and had to be shaken up every time i used it (only used it 3 times).  Its also called a moisturizer but the directons say it needs to go on moisturized skin. So its basically just makeup not a moisturizer. It also broke me out soooo bad almost immediately within 1-2 uses. * Upon receiving and opening the product for the first time a watery liquid came out. I tried shaking it but it didn't really mix. I ended up just squeezing out what I could & I will say even though it was watery, it did help tone down the redness. * Do not like this formula AT ALL. It was all watery and separated when I took the top off. Like when I went to get some out for the first time, clear liquid came out. Even after vigorously shaking to re-mix the product, it was a thin oily consistency. And worst of all, how can it be a color corrector for redness if it's not green?? That's the whole point. Color theory means it has to be green to correct red. This was just an average nude (for white) skin tone. So yeah...don't bother. Product separates, oily consistency, and wrong color for its stated purpose. I will be returning it. * Super disappointed, this was like water & made a horrible mess. I couldn't even use it. :( * Like the title says, the product separated during shipping. When I first opened it, product came out in a clear liquid, smelled a lil weird too. After vigorous shaking, product came out in a beige/brown color (picture attached), different from advertised as a green tint. I spoke to Ulta Beauty's virtual assistant/live online sales assistant, and I was told to go to an Ulta Beauty store to speak with a store associate but there's no Ulta Beauty store in my city at all! I'm a lil frustrated and am just going to throw away the product (likely expired). * Products have to have a perfect ingredient list or else I break out in cystic acne. This product is loaded with pore-clogging ingredients and broke me out worse than anything I've ever used EVER. Coloration unnatural looking, too. Oily and smelly. * Im so disappointed you dont have this product in your store or available on line. Will you carry it again?"

Its great for day and no irritation! * It burns really badly after applying * I gave this moisturizer a few tries but i have sensitive skin and it burns * I heard great things about First Aid Beauty so I decided to try this product. Every time I jse this profuct, my skin burns. It said its made for sensitive skin and my skin isnt that sensitive but for some reason it burns my skin. * It felt like my face was going to melt off! Who made this?? Do not buy! * Felt the irritating feeling and burning immediately after applying. Washed it off. Applied a different moisterizer and my face still feels bad. Taking it back"

I wish it just came in bigger ounces available. * I'm mid 40s. Definitely need sunscreen when using retinol@ night..  this is nice and thin, and blends well with my  loreal foundation.  Definitely recommend.  Wish it was bigger size! .  4 stars. * This product is ok for a sunscreen. It feels ok when you first put it on but gets flaky towards the end of application. It is very moisturizing but extremely to shiny and greasy for me . If it wasn't for that I would repurchase it . * best product for my acne-prone skin. makes my skin glowy and i think it's been healing my moisture barrier * broke me out so badly I am still dealing with it a month later will never use again * My friend had the higher end ultra sheer Neutrogena sunscreen, and she had to use mine instead; this doesn't make you look like a ghost, and with a spf of 50 it was great for the Grand Canyon * I use this all year especially in the summer and when we go to the southwest."

This cream felt great on my hand when I tested it in the store. I used it when I got home, and my face instantly turned red and blotchy. It burned also. Wish I hadn't bought it. * I don't always believe over hyped products, but this one definitely deserves the recognition it has received. Glides onto your skin like butter, and gives such a beautiful glow. Recently started tretnoin, and my skin has been super dry. This is very moisturizing and definitely helps with my dry flaky skin. Works well under makeup as well. Good for day and nightly use. Highly recommend! * Nothing special at all. Not worth the money. Like a basic moisturizer with horrible rose scent. Returned. * This is an incredibly moisturizing cream that feels so light weight. I use it overnight and wake up with a smooth and bump free complexion. It also does an amazing job as a primer before make up. * I decided to treat myself with this cream as a little birthday gift. Tried it for a couple of days and my skin felt so incredibly dry. I thought it was just the weather so I kept using it. Little did I know, I would get the biggest rash of my life. A bunch of tiny red dots started to appear all over my face, especially around my eyes. My skin burned and flaked, even touching my skin became painful. It's such a shame because I had such high hopes for this cream, but this is NOT for sensitive skin."

Not oily ! Not heavy! No white or gray film ! No residue! Hydration good but you may need more than three pumps for more effect. I only use maybe one pump. * I really love this brand but this is a miss for me. This is the first product that i actually dont even want to keep using until it's done. I like it bc it's a heavier moisturizer, but i cant get it anywhere near my eyes. Also, i went into the ocean with just this on and it burned my eyes worse then straight chemical sunscreen. And i just read the other review saying it's not reef safe. Come on now...i expected better from this brand. * I have tried sunscreens from every brand, price range, and formulation... the only one that holds up to this is a ""bomb"" Korean one, and it's a bit more expensive. My cream concealer blends right in, but I will admit that I have to set this with powder before I use a powder foundation, especially if I plan on buffing it in. For the price point, you can't beat this one.

P.S. Hey, Pacifica, please don't discontinue this like my Vitamin C & Sheer SPF 50 serum 😭 and my pineapple curls curl cream. I swear I love so much of what you produce, and then y'all switch up on me with discontinuing my faves... the betrayal is REAL TO ME! l * I love these products. Highly recommend. * I have been a Pacifica user for YEARS. I trusted them as an early brand for clean beauty, when that category was much (much) smaller. While this product smelled amazing, and soaked in great...I started breaking out. I couldn't figure it out for a week!

Not only are octyl salicylate and octocrylene not reef safe, but they also break me out terribly with what feels more like a burn. Stay away, if not for yourself - for the environment."

It leaves my face so soft. Totally love it. * I have rosacea, acne prone, superrrr sensitive skin. Like everything makes my skin freak out. This is a miracle product. It keeps my skin so hydrated (with no breakouts) during these dry winters and summers in utah. Amazing product. I dont see myself switching moisturizer for a long long time.

You dont need much either, a little goes a long way. Very happy and highly recommend for anyone looking for a good hydrating cream, its not greasy or heavy and theres practically no sent to it which I love. * I bought this during a 21 Days of Beauty, so luckily only paid half the normal price.  It is just fine.  My skin tends to be dry, and this doesn't make it feel especially moisturized.  I wouldn't buy it again. * I will buy again as it keep your skin soft I tried all the face cream as the weather is so dry but I found only this one which kept my skin hydrated * I love the feeling it leaves on the skin. * Light in texture. Fragrance is subtle. Only need a little, absorbs quickly but keeps my face hydrated all day. Doesnt clog my pores or cause breakouts. Layers well under my sunscreen and makeup. There is a version with spf but its not enough, and it feels heavy. I prefer this version, and layer my spf50 over this. Also love that its refillable. * Leaves my face feeling hydrated and plumped and smooth * I rarely get irritated skin from a skincare product, but this cream irritated my face so badly. After applying in the morning, by nighttime, my skin was red, itchy, and breaking out. Over the next few days. my face was super dry and peeling.

I researched topical products to address it and Avene Tolerance was listed with good commentary esp the timeframe for results after the 1st use. Failure! * I have very dry, irritated, sensitive skin around my mouth and nose… tried so many products but nothing worked until I started using this and their Cicalfate+ serum daily and once a week I use their Cicalfate+ restorative protective cream… all three are amazing I just wish they were not so expensive specially considering how small they are. * Love this product * I have sensitive, reactive, and acne prone skin. Anything i try can make my perioral dermatitis flare or i end up with closed comedones. This moisturizer is the only one that doesnt flare me up and doesnt cause closed comedones!!! I love it! Leaves my face smooth with no greasy feeling! * I have seriously sensitive skin that will react if you look at it wrong. I started using this cream a few years back and it has saved my life. I have oily skin, but the rosacea makes my skin patchy with dry spots, and this lotion helps SOOO much. I use it morning and night and even layer it under makeup. Avene has so many great products, many that don't include fragrance of any kind (even natural), and because of that, I'll be a loyal customer for as long as they keep it up. If you have sensitive skin, are prone to redness, and/or have rosacea, try this face lotion! * Loooooovveee this balm! Not too heavy, not too light. My skin is hypersensitive and reactive to everything, but not this! It was a relief to my very irritated skin diring pregnancy and now postpartum. The only downside is that I wish it wasnt so small for the price. But its worth it for a product i finally don't react to! * This stuff is amazing. I have Perioral dermatitis and I have tried all the creams. This one has truly worked in helping my get rid of it. Don't be discouraged that the balm is somewhat thick (many recommend lightweight moisturizers for PD). It truly does the trick."

I love the silky feel of it and I love that absorbs into my skin and doesn't make my skin feel tacky. I'm in my 50s and I have noticed a difference in my skin since I been using this cream. I highly recommend it. * Where do I even start?! This cream is absolutely amazing! Im in love with the results of this cream, I'm astonished at how much my skin has changed since using this! Im super impressed! My skin feels so velvety, soft and supple. Like baby skin! Really! I don't know what they put in it so get my skin so so buttery soft but it's more than just hydrated, the texture is very unique. Its just sooo soft and feels amazing. It's hard to explain, but it's definitely more than moisturized. It's silky! It's awesome. I just want to feel my skin over and over again. The scent is so nice too. I love the experience of putting it on , there so many sensory luxuries to it. The scent, the texture of it when you put it on, the way your skin looks and feels afterwords is so nice. I'm hitting my 40s and definitely need help in terms of dryness , wrinkles, and loss of elasticity. This hits all those boxes in just one cream! This is must for all ages in my opinion. If I would had wore this in my younger years, my skin would be so different. If just wearing this for over a week transforms my skin , i wonder what more time would do. I definitely recommend this for wrinkles , loss of firmness and dry or even not so soft skin. Its amazing! * I honestly loved this cream. It works like a charm! I've been trying it for the past week and let me tell you, it does actually lift. Also the packaging and the bottle itself is so aesthetically pleasing. I received this cream as promo for my review. * At 42, I started noticing the signs of aging showing up faster than I expected—looser skin, a drooping look, and a loss of that youthful glow. I'd always heard that Black skin doesn't age as quickly, but that hasn't been my experience.
Then I tried the PUR Lifting Cream—and wow. The difference is undeniable.
✨ My facial features look tighter and more defined
✨ My skin feels deeply nourished and luminous
✨ Even my neck shows a visible lift
✨ The texture is lightweight, non-greasy, and smells amazing
✨ And best of all? It's affordable and delivers real results
This cream has truly transformed how I feel in my skin. I hands down recommend it. * At 42, I started noticing the signs of aging showing up faster than I expected—looser skin, a drooping look, and a loss of that youthful glow.

If you have dry skin, it is a must try!! * Love this primer- really hydrates my skin before makeup * I don't necessarily love how my makeup sits on top of this primer. As another review mentioned it seems to pill. * Made my foundation peel right off. The primer itself feels nice ans hydating but would not recommend putting makeup on top. * I use this product every day with or without makeup, it feels so nice on my skin and keeps it hydrated and gives it a nice glow."

Unfortunately, this product was the cause of acne and a rosacea-like reaction. Had to stop immediately. * This was my first time trying a TULA face product and I had an allergic reaction. Not too long after applying this product to my freshly cleaned face and neck I started to develop an allergic reaction with tiny rashes all over where the product was applied. It was painful and itchy. Unfortunately this didn't work for me. * I got this as a gift and got a bunch of red bumps on my skin, do not buy! * This light-weight moisturizer truly does promote bright, clear skin. Don't expect it to completely remove dark spots, however. I recommend an entire skin care regimen that will assist you with balanced, even skin tone. * This feels hydrating and great. I've already noticed changes and will continue to use Tula! * I love this moisturizer. I have sensitive skin that becomes dry and dull in the winter. The moisturizer does not irritate my skin and keeps my skin moisturized all day long. It smells great too!"

I'm 65 and I was starting to really show it! * Treat yourself to this eye cream.  I have tried so many that leave your under eyes looking cakey or dry, or too hydrating where it becomes oily or sticky.

I have oily skin and i use this as a part of my nightime routine. It absorbs very well, and super light weight. It doesnt have a smell and a little goes a long way. I would totally recommend. * Unfortunately not a good fit for my combination oily skin. Feels nice initially going on, and there's definitely some oil control benefit. However I've noticed that it makes my dry patches even drier and more flakey with consistent use. Could be a good fit for someone without dryness. * Beware that this product might burn your skin. I used it as recommended and it left bright red marks on my neck and face. * This might be fine in the summer but definitely not moisturizing enough for me in fall/winter. I find my skin is oily and tight half way through the day. It is cooling on the skin and decent under a tinted moisturizer. * This product has helped my oiliness slightly, and did not irritate the sensitive areas on my face, and doesn't burn when applying. It soaks in quickly, and my skin feels refreshed afterward. I don't see why I wouldn't continue to use this product. There is no scent, which I appreciate. * I liked. * I have had trouble finding a good go-to lotion thats not greasy, and this is amazing. I use it everyday AM and PM, and it leaves my face feeling so smooth and clean without the feeling of a heavy moisturizer. I would compare this to the belif aqua bomb, just even more lightweight."

And I love using the eye masks in the morning as I get ready for the day; it perks your skin and eyes right up! * The eye patches didn't do anything for the dark circles under my eyes and the moisturizer wasn't enough for the desert climate that I live in. * One of my favorite moisturizers. My eyes are very sensitive and many moisturizers, and serums cause them to burn if I use them around my face. Not these and I love the moisturizer for morning and night. * My skin is always dry even after trying other moisturizers the next day its super dry.

It was gross and it looked like a disease was on my face or like the lotion was curdling…I thought it was a one time thing because I applied it while using anotjer product too and thought they didnt mix well. I used this product again this morning with no other products and it still did it. Very disappointing because I love their products but I swear they have changed the formulas recently * It's moisturizing but the white cast is really bad- if you have a darker complexion do not buy this it only really works if youre naturally super pale * If it didnt specify that its a face moisturizer with sunscreen you would think that its just a typical sunscreen for your face. It has no hydrating effect whatsoever and it leaves white streaks. I combine it with their hydrating facial moisturizer and it works well, but at that point I have to buy two products to get the one result this product should accomplish by itself. Overall I don't think its worth it if you're looking for a good moisturizer that has sunscreen added. * I received a sample of this sunscreen and am buying another bottle. This is a perfect sunscreen if you have dry or sensitive skin. It is a very thick, creamy formula. My skin feels hydrated all day, and I didn't experience any breakouts like I have from other sunscreens. Because it's a mineral sunscreen, it doesn't burn your eyes if you sweat. However, buyer beware! The zinc in it will leave a white cast, which is typical for mineral sunscreens. This is not a good option for deeper skin tones if you are looking to avoid a white cast. * This has decent moisturizing properties, however leaves a white cast on your face. * No matter how much I rub it in, I look like a ghost after I use this product * I have very sensitive skin and love First aid beauty moisturizer.

It feels so luxurious when you out it on and ot instantly changes rhe way my face feels and my skin is lotetally glowing. Super happy i found thid snd will pribably be using this forever! * I would use this even if it didn't contain Vitamin C because it is so moisturizing; it is like a layer of protective cushion for your skin. The fact it contains the stable form of Vitamin C that most dermatologists prefer to recommend is of course THE reason to use it. I also LOVE that they didn't add fragrance to mask the  normal smell of the vitamin C ingredient. Yes, that odd ""hot dog?"" scent is just what the vitamin C smells like, and it dissipates in less than a minute. * Bought this product about a month ago, I was worried at first about spending so much money, but it was time to drop the dime. I'll be turning 35 soon and my skin was dull, dry and sometimes had red patches that would burn when using other creams, correctors and moisturizers. 
Since using this product my skin looks just as young and fresh as it did in my 20's!

Product was like hardened vaseline and it WOULD NOT COME OFF.  It moved toward my eyelashes and now I am constantly wiping my eyes (days later). This is a horrible product and I am not sure how to get it off my eyelids.  It seems to be clogging each eyelash pore. I cannot BELIEVE they'd make such a product and I am THROUGH with ""free"" samples.  It's not free if it is going to pull out eyelashes and cost money to see an eye doctor and possibly derm MD.  SO ANGRY! * I like the NECK firming cream so I thought I would try this FACE firming cream.  I can't take the smell of this FACE cream.  I returned it, so can't give a review on if it works.  The NECK firming cream has a nice light sent. * I got a sample of this product with the purchase and I can't see how well it works because there was barely enough in the package to get around my eyes, but let me tell you this stuff smells toxic, toxic, toxic it literally smelt like I was putting something industrial on my face. I'm shocked that this has such good reviews and I literally had my jaw drop when I saw how expensive this was when looking it up to write this review * I really like this moisturizer. I feel that it does have a firming affect and feels great, even under make up. I have been using it for a year. Its just too expensive and there are cheaper alternatives now.

229,la roche-posay,"mela b3 uv daily moisturizer sunscreen, spf 30",pimprod2043466,2620363," * I don't review much, but this one deserves it. I've tried probably 30-40 kinds of sunscreen via samples and full-blown purchases. Everyone's sunscreen preferences are different, but this one is my absolute Holy Grail.

So far I've gone through four tubes, and I've gotten two family members to start using it.

To be fair, I can't quite tell if it has done *most* of the heavy lifting for my post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation as I use a lot of other actives (like forms of retinol, vitamin C, etc), but I used to have horrible cystic acne outbreaks for years (stopped months ago due to nutritional changes), and the dark spots are shockingly barely noticeable -- I'm POSITIVE this has helped amongst other factors because I used to end up with scabs from cystic acne heads that were so large and painful, I was convinced they'd ruin my skin forever. This also has niacinamide at 10% and the Melasyl-- I know this product has been a crucial component to get my skin tone even again. Keep in mind, it's a long-term game. Results don't happen overnight.

Best aspect about this sunscreen? It's application. The texture is smooth, perfect balance between viscous liquid gel and an ultra light, easily-blended moisturizer. NOT heavy nor thick. I don't ""feel"" it on my skin. I've used it under make-up of course, but it's actually been on non-make-up days that I've had several coworkers comment on my skin being ""glowing"" when just wearing this sunscreen alone (almost acting like a primer/face base). It seriously gives your face a subtle glow that's not from shimmer or mica. Also has a subtle scent I like very much (exact same scent as La Roche Posay's Mela B3 serum which I've just tried for first time).

I've run out and been forcing myself to use other sunscreens I've purchased or free samples I've received... tried everything from mineral sunscreens, K-beauty brands, Supergoop, Shieseido ($),  Naked Sundays, Kinship, Lancome, Vacation, Elf, Live Tinted, Coola... and frankly this is the best one for an SPF-30 rated sunscreen for me above them all.

Sometimes I do need SPF 50 for summer days so I do have to switch it out due to UV index, but this is my first choice undoubtedly when the SPF 30 sun protection is enough. * This product made my face burn . It was red for three days and had a horrible burning sensation. Now I have stronger spots and oily pimples, like acne. The worst part is that I ordered the mela serum, as soon as I receive it I will have to return it, I love this brand but this product did not work for me. * I used this product for 3 days and was not outside.  On the 4th day I discovered a rash on my face, almost like small blisters under the skin.  It appeared in the exact spots where I applied the cream. I immediately stopped. Five days later my face is beginning to clear. * I have oily skin so hard to find a good sunscreen.  This leaves my skin nice, no breakouts, and hoping it lightens my melasma. Haven't been using long enough to really tell. I like it though! * This product disappointed me. I tried it for about a week, and I woke up to three new acne spots, which was strange because the website claims it is non-comedogenic. However, when I looked into the ingredients, I was disheartened to find that it contains shea butter, which can clog pores, especially for those with oily skin. I really wanted to love it, but unfortunately, I can't. * AVOID WEARING UNDER MAKEUP - PILLING 
I always wear makeup under foundation/concealer and i usually keep my base routine super simple (e.g. water-based serum plus sunscreen). I applied this sunscreen under my makeup twice already and both times my foundation pilled and separated. I applied the foundation using a puff sponge. Now, I will only apply this sunscreen on no makeup days and will use as a hand sunscreen as well. * I love it"
230,peter thomas roth,water drench hyaluronic cloud rich barrier moisturizer,pimprod2036804,2603438," * Love ❤️ Love * Warning: if you do not like thick moisturizers please don't get this.

It is fantastic for dry or dehydrated skin, it's a very dense and creamy texture, but when you warm it up with your fingers it melts well into the skin. I personally really like it. I don't typically go for expensive moisturizers but this is definitely one of the few that I think gives a very lush yet hydrated feel to the skin. I plan to stock up on this for future winter months, but I'd suspect it may be too much in the summertime. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. * I used to get extreme dry patches in my T zone, bad enough I refused to wear foundation because of how flaky my skin would look after applying it. I tried the original water drench moisturizer from PTR and loved it. When this version came out, i thought how big of a difference can it be? Its a HUGE difference. 
My skin stays soft hours and hours after applying, the overall feel is amazing. With anyone who struggles with dry, flaky skin this is a miracle worker. But you have to stay consistent. One jar lasts me almost 6 months, only a dime size is needed, two if it is particularly dry. Amazing product, so I recommend to bite the bullet when it comes to the price and give it a try. * I have dry skin and this is the most relieving and hydrating product ive tried. Found it through a free sample and had to get it. Love barriers but this is the best. Little goes a long way and keeps me moisturized all day/night. * I've purchased the original cloud cream numerous times! I love how hydrating that one is and how it sinks into my skin. It plays well with my makeup and doesn't cause breakouts. Just recently I purchased a set that has the OG cream and this RICH barrier cream. Wow, my new HG 💯 I put it on at night after actives and I can totally see & feel the difference in the morning. I'm 39, living in hot & arid AZ with an extremely oily T zone and insanely dry outer perimeter of my face. Not gonna lie, it leaves your face greasy but with visible results in the morning!!!! I've tried numerous thick moisturizers and nothing works like this one! Hydrated and doesn't break me out either. I use the OG cream in the morning & rich cream at night ❤️ Please don't ever stop making these creams! * I never used to use a hydrator expecting that my moisturizer would do the job but after 40, my skin kept getting drier and no matter how much expensive moisturizer I used, it never felt hydrated. Enter using a hydrator recommend by a dermatologist. I use a serum, hydrator and then my moisturizer. Game changer. I started with the Clinique one but this is superior in my opinion. Try it. Your thirsty skin will thank you! * I would recommend to anyone."

I love it and gives a great glow to the face * I received this sunscreen after attending their promotional walk for the launch of the product. I noticed the very next day I started getting micro bumps that resembled milia or granulomatous. I stopped wearing make up and switched to a gentle cleanser to see if those were the reasons however I remained applying the sunscreen to obviously help protect my face. To my surprise, my skin was only getting worse. It was starting to burn and itch. I've been allergy tested, and I don't have any. The day I didn't use the sunscreen, my skin condition immediately disappeared, so I went to look at the ingredients list. I don't know if Origins is using the oils from grapefruit, lemon and orange for fragrance purposes, but it does not list anywhere that they have extracted the furanocoumarins. After meeting with my dermatologist, I was advised that the citrus oils used in the sunscreen caused photosensitivity, and burned/ irritated my skin. If you are someone with darker or sensitive skin, I HIGHLY recommend AVOIDING this."

Started using this product again this week remembered why I love this! My face is becoming rehydrated again. The brightness is coming back and my rosacea is subsiding. I do have sensitive skin and this seems to do the trick to balance pH levels. If you have tried other products with no luck, try this product. Not every product fits everyone but this one is definitely worth the try. To me... worth every cent🙏 * 'My daughter is 14 and this product has been great for her acne * I love to try new products so I've experimented with a number of daily moisturizers with SPF like Drunk Elephant and Unseen Sunscreen and always come back to this Murad holy grail. It doesn't leave a white cast, is moisturizing, non-greasy, and doesn't pill under my makeup. I use this daily and a bottle lasts me roughly 4 months. I'm honestly shocked at other reviews saying they broke out as I have acne prone skin and never have but YMMV. * This is a decent sunscreen, rubs in fine and makes my skin soft. However this burns my eyes soooo bad. Obviously I know to not get sunscreen in my eyes, but it doesn't matter how carefully I put it on, my eyes burn. I have very sensitive & dry eyes and it just doesn't work. The Tula one in the yellow bottle, is the one I continue to go back too. * I was very excited to try this but was disappointed to find the results being similar to a drug store brand product not to mention this product caused my skin to break out and become oily. Never had those issues with my skin before starting to use this. Also the product just pours out of the bottle causing you to end up wasting product every time you use it which makes you run out a lot faster than you would expect. * I have heard great things about Murad so I finally decided to treat myself to this moisturizer. I wanted to love it SO bad but my skin has BLOWN UP with acne so bad, it's starting to really get to me. I used to struggle with acne but it had gotten to be almost non-existed until I bought this. At first I thought my pregnancy hormones had caused my flare up, and it could be a contributor, but this is really the only new piece of my skincare regimen and it seems like others have had the same bad experience as me too. Will be throwing it away and buying my old moisturizer. * As always, every experience can be different but I'll tell you mine: I have very sensitive skin , dry to normal, rarely have acne besides the occasional pimple. When I started using this, my face broke out like a crunch bar. TONS of bumps and several pimples. I started a new night cream at the same time so I wasn't sure, but as soon as I stopped using this my face cleared. It was pretty instant, at the end of the day the bumps were the worst and I would wash my face and wake up to no bumps (not what happens with typical acne). If you haven't heard of acne cosmetica, google it that way you can watch out for it with this product or any others. After looking closer I realized THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS SOME COMEDOGENIC INGREDIENTS (i.e. ethylhexyl palmitate)"

Im on day 2 and WOW my skin looks soooooo smooth and clear!! I noticed it got rid of my acne too!! 🥹 Love love it! Worth every peny! I used to buy the sunday riley luna sleeping night oil double the cost of this and have not seen this much improvement in such a short term like this!! * After a few days i noticed a cluster of bumps on my neck and chest area. I figured it was from something else like perfume, but then I noticed smaller bumps on my face. I don't consider my skin sensitive so i am surprised. I wish this worked out."
235,tonymoly,wonder ceramide mochi water cream,pimprod2040801,2613434," * This moisturizer is a little below OK for me. I have dry skin, and this moisturizer is incredibly lightweight, so I knew I would have to apply it and then go in with something a little heavier and thicker over it to ""lock"" it in, especially to get any (if at all) benefits from the ceramides. It is highly fragrant and irritates my skin at times. I would not recommend if you have sensitive and/or dry skin. * I have very sensitive combo skin. This product is amazing! My skin looks very hydrated. Absorbs very well with no greasy feel. I will definitely buy again! * This has instantly become my favorite! I have combination and sensitive skin so I have to watch the products I use. This has hands down hydrated and left my skin feeling plumped but light. Also works to tame face eczema flareups. It's a lifesaver! * I love this moisturizer so much. I have combo skin, and i love this as my night time moisturizer during the summer time. It absorbs instantly into the skin and doesnt leave a greasy feeling to my skin that orher gel creams do when i sweat at night. I also have sensitive skin and this doesnt break me out or irritate me at all. It feels amazing  going on and makes my skin feel so smooth. Highly recommend. * Been trying different Korean products and ordered 2 of these. When I first applied it I instantly fell in love! It absorbs easily onto my skin, hydrating and I love that it is s water cream so the texture itself is so airy. Def would buy this again! * Im always looking for a good moisturizer for my oily skin I've tried so many and I always come back to this one. One of the best ones in the market, im sad they don't sell the big size at Ulta anymore.): * very hydrating, it relieves my eczema and acne-prone skin. the large tub basically lasts forever. only downside is ulta doesn't sell the large size of this anymore :("
236,charlotte tilbury,magic water cream gel moisturizer with niacinamide,pimprod2043839,2620075," * I have sensitive skin and the original broke me out within a few days. This one gives the same glowing skin without the heaviness that clogs my pores. I've tried so many moisturizers but I think this is the holy grail for me * I have tried countless moisturizers from MILK, OLAY, Clinique, and even celebrity branded moisturizers but NONE have been able to provide the consistent hydrtaing effect on my poor dry/ oily skin, if you know you know. But Charlotte Tilbury definitely delivered when it came to my needs! I dont think i cant ever move on to a different product < 3 * This cream is amazing! It makes my skin feel soft, hydrated, and glowing without being heavy. My makeup goes on so smoothly after using it—definitely a new staple in my routine! * I usually am very sensitive to both moisturizers and primers but this works as both! It's hydrating and a nice light base to put your makeup over. * Not too long using this product but I really like this moisturizer,  It left my skin feeling hydrated, smooth, fresh and radiant. * Great for combo to oily skin. Gives a glass-like, dewy skin finish. I can wear it with just my tinted SPF and my skin looks great all day. * This moisturizer is genuinely the best and the highest quality i have ever used. I have dry skin with dry patches and while this doesnt get rid of the patches it definitely relieves them the most compared to other products. Better than drunk elephant and better than cerave. The only con is it is soooo expensive. It it honestly worth it to me"
237,beautybio,the zenbubble oil-free calming gel cream,pimprod2019384,2572411," * This gel cream from BeautyBio is my go-to whenever my skin is irritated, breaking out, or red. The lightweight, cooling texture feels so soothing and gives my skin the perfect amount of hydration without feeling greasy. It calms irritation, keeps my skin balanced, and even helps prevent breakouts — a must-have for my acne-prone skin. Complimentary from Beautybio. * Ive been buying it for a couple of years now and it always leaves my face so soft. When i wear makeup it also works as a good base leaving makeup flawless with no need of primer it definitely is worth it * Someone at ulta recommended me this one, really pricey to me, I usually dont spend over 30 on moisturizers, but this is one of my favorites (not enough for me to consistently buy it though). Goes on light, a little goes a long way I'd say, I have combination skin that used to be really oily but now is rather dry, I'd say it's fine for all skin types personally. Also it comes out by pressing down on it, whenever it runs low you can twist to get the rest of it. I was stressing out trying to get it out before realizing it opens. Again, would buy this all the time if not for the pricing, but pretty worth it * I've purchased this two times now and am loving how light it feels on the skin while being super hydrating for my dry skin. The container pump makes it so easy to apply. * I got this and the eye cream, both burned my eyes and skin. I am sensitive but don't usually break out in a few hours from a product. Also were very sticky long after applying just them and no other products for self testing. * Far from a moisturizer but in fact left my skin super oily. * Hands down the best makeup primer EVER. Its too good. My makeup looks freshly applied all day long. I csnt say enough about it."
238,dune suncare,the mug guard broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2039109,2608975," * This is hands down the best sunscreen I've used as someone with a darker complexion and acne prone skin. It's moisturizing without the greasy, heavy feeling usual sunscreens leave behind, and it doesnt leave any white cast. * I have sensitive skin, reactive skin, combination skin, and acne prone skin. This sunscreen is the only sunscreen I keep coming back to!! 

It hasn't caused break outs, doesn't clog my pores, and hasn't caused excess oil production. I also love that the green helps soothe red skin. 

Also, even with it only being a SPF 30 it does a great job at keeping my face from getting sunburnt even with being out in the sun all day! * I really don't understand all the 4-5 star reviews. This suscreen has to be one of the worst sunscreens I've tried. It's sort of giving fake reviews but who knows 🤷‍♀️ because I have acne prone skin and this made it so much worse while I was using it. I see some people with fungal acne saying it's safe for they're skin type—yes, I understand fungal & acne prone are not the same! HOWEVER, they are very similar!! All this to say, PLEASEEE SAVE YOUR PRECIOUS MONEY ESPECIALLY IN THIS ECONOMY AND LOOK FOR ANOTHER OPTION! This sunscreen is ssa. Sorry not sorry. I just feel so gaslit by these reviews. I know that not everything is meant to work for me but ive tried other suncreens I maybe wasnt a fan of but they still did their job. This sunscreen on the other hand, did the opposite and actually cause me to breakout. * I am very prone to sunscreen moisturizers burning my eyes and have tried so many and im glad i finally tried this one. Does not burn my eyes, i wear it before long runs and when i go in the ocean. No burning. Also doesnt have a scent or a gross lingering smell like some other sunscreens which im also sensitive to. Love the texture too. Buying my second bottle now. * This is a great sunscreen. It does have that sunscreen smell but I quickly go nose blind to it. The claims are true! It does not pill, it's quick drying, and there is no white cast. I will say it does give me that dewy glow so if you're looking for a matte look- look elsewhere. * As I sit here with one eye open waiting for my bf to get back from the car with Micellar wipes, my eyes have been burning so badly for the past 2 hours (prob put it on an hour before that and it took time to ""travel"" to my eyes""), and I no longer can take it. I liked the feel of the formula and it rubbed in well. It's a larger size than many other bottles of face sunscreen. Thats the 2nd star. And I bougnt 2 of these. Nope. Never again. * As someone who breaks out to a lot of different skincare products, this is one of the few sunscreens that doesn't. I found no irritation around my eyes when I applied it, and it left no white cast on my medium skin! I love to buy it when its on sale."
239,strivectin,advanced retinol nightly renewal moisturizer,pimprod2026692,2582803," * this separates very badly. the product works well, but is frustrating. I have to store it upside down so it doesnt leak the oil everywhere. you have to shake the product exceptionally well to get it kind of mixed together. I like it a lot, it is just too expensive to be having so many issues with the messiness. * When I received it and opened it up, immediately oil came out and I shook it to mix up but it leaked in my drawer because of the separation. It's too expensive for this to happen. * This is one of my new go-to's for night treatment!! Feel like I wake up looking younger and more refreshed! I'm in my 50's but love great skincare! Very gentle for the results I've seen! Will be sure to purchase again! Highly recommend! * Tried them all…  This is the Best Choice  Lifts, hydrates, softens, brightens and reduces pores! * I can't say enough great things about this wonderful night cream I adore Strivectin and this moisturizer is my night cream of choice I know that when I use it I'll wake up to glowing , firm & overall better skin * Good!

I do two layers before going to bed, its so good! I also enjoy the smell as well and its not too overpowering. The price is ok and I enjoyed it more than the Tatcha water cream I tried and its a lot more expensive! * I recommend this product to EVERYBODY. This stuff right here has completely changed my life. I get compliments on my skin all the time since ive started using this in 2022. I will never stop using it!!! * I have used this product every day, twice a day since 2017. I absolutely love it! It is lightweight, dries down smooth, and helps hydrate my oily sensitive skin. I would cry if FAB ever discontinued this product. 1000% would recommend. * This is a great moisturizer super lightweight better for like oily or skin types. But I like it as a quick little water cream to add to whatever else I'm using for the day. Smells delicious and love coconut so for me, this is a must have! * This product is amazing, it's so light weight and smells amazing.

Originally I switched to the Sarah😙 V moisturizer that I used in undergrad, but I feel like the product was not moisturizing enough. I also previously used the Peter Thomas Roth moisturizer, but didn't wanna spend that much money while I'm not working. I bought two of these moisturizers while it was on sale for Black Friday and I love them. Super moisturizeruzing, and my skin feel so refreshed when I wake up in the morning. It also does not clog your skin as some moisturizer do. A little goes a long way with how thick the product is. The containers are a little small, so I would only recommend buying them on sale. * I really do love this moisturizer it dos everything and more. i have super dry skin in the winter time and this does wonders!! The only issue i have is that i atruggle to open the lid and i dont struggle opening anything. I have to have my bf opennit for me every time or i wont be able to get it myself. (im not tightening it super tight either!) other tha that its perfect! * My one and only con with this moisturizer is that it's more pricey, than id like. But yall do not understand I have acne-prone and sensitive skin, this genuinely seems to be the only moisturizer that my skin doesn't react to  and actually enjoys. if your skin can't handle anything complex or botanical and is on the drier side and needs hydration, YES, you will love this, promise 🥹💋 * My skin has been going downhill after hitting 40. This cream has brought it back a bit. It's very hydrating. My skin looks plumper. I have very sensitive skin and this cream is not irritating at all. * For reference I am 46 years old and have just begun a real skin care regime in the last 6 months. I have started using this cream nightly for the last month. I apply after I cleanse my face with an oil cleanser in the evening. My face usually feels rather tight after cleansing and this product is my go to for bedtime moisturizer. This leaves my skin feeling supple and moisturized without feeling super greasy for bed. This seems to have helped with fine lines and has not had any adverse reaction on my skin. I will definitely repurchase and keep using. * My skin is so soft, and it has helped with fine lines. I've only been using this product for 2 weeks, but I love it. I would definitely recommend this product to other ladies who want to improve the look and feel of their skin especially in a short amount of time. * their milky toning lotion has already changed my skin entirely the last few months. like seriously. this cream just made my skin so plump and soft and overnight took away some texture and redness, just like the toner"

Peter Thomas Roth is the best! * I was skeptical at first, but have noticed less wrinkles under my eyes and my makeup applies smoother * Amazing peptide complex and anti aging results * I splurged on this product as I felt my skin needed just a good moisturizer that locked everything in and protected it. The product is heavier than most but I feel it does a great job of hydrating my skin. The biggest con I have is the blue painted lid on the jar peels and leaves blue fragments of paint in the product, thus it going on my face. My fingertips are physically blue after simply unscrewing the cap. It actually concerns me because you never know what companies are using to manufacture their products. Disappointed with such a high price point. * Ive been using PTR products for 10+ years and my skin shows amazing results from the use of these products over the years.

I am able to sleep in it without feeling sticky or ""wet"" feeling. I have sensitive skin so this is a great product for me. * My daughter (a dermatologist) recommended this moisturizing lotion several years ago.  I have tried others, but always go back to this product.  Now I highly recommend this lotion for aging skin! * This moisturizer has been my go-to for years. I have sensitive skin and I have been using it on my face since 2019. My skin stays hydrated, glowy, and clear of any blemishes when I use this moisturizer compared to any other moisturizer I've used. This is really shocking but great considering the price of this product compared to other skincare. I take this with me and use it all year! It also has worked great on keeping me moisturized on my legs, where I'm prone to eczema. Everyone's skin is different, but mine really loves this moisturizer! 🩷 * i have acne prone combination skin, it seems to be clogging my pores and giving me closed comedones * I absolutely love the Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion, Hydrating Body Moisturizer! It provides amazing hydration without feeling heavy or sticky, which is a big plus for me. My skin feels soft and nourished all day long, and I don't have to worry about it feeling greasy or tacky. I also appreciate that it has no fragrance, so it's perfect for sensitive skin or anyone who prefers unscented products.

I use this with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide or salicylic acid and it pairs well with all my serums and sunscreen. This is also great under makeup since it's not oily and helps makeup last longer. I've repurchased this moisturizer at least 4 times and I always have a backup! * I love that this moisturizer is buildable. You xan relaly control how much you need. It feels great on my skin and my skin is noticeably more plump. I love it! * I am acne-prone but need a moisturizer for skin dryness, especially during the winter when the cold wind easily dries out your skin. After using this moisturizer, I have had several instances of bad luck with getting a new pimple the next morning. The texture and application (no burning) of this product are fine. It does its job to moisturize the skin. However, not without suffering more blemishes sadly. I picked this while trying to find noncomedogenic moisturizers with clean ingredients according to Yuka, but my mom helped point out to me later this has vegetable oil in it… Cool! 🙃 * its just perfect and a little goes a long way * I dont really know what people are saying about this product, most people are saying its lightweight and non greasy but it feels so heavy, sticky, and greasy on my face, maybe just not for me but I won't be buying this again * I have sensitive skin and this works well for me. Love that it isnt too heavy on my combo/acne prone skin * I was hoping this product would work well on my acne-prone skin, but it doesn't seem to do much for me. It doesn't absorb very well into the skin so the more you use the more ends up sitting on your face. The claims about this moisturizer being pre-biotic don't seem to mean much. Hero specializes in products for acne and acne-prone skin, so I assumed this moisturizer would work well in my routine and be hydrating but I was disappointed."

I have deep forehead wrinkles and this has helped soo much. * I wore these overnight like instructed and when I took them off in the morning I had much more pronounced and deep wrinkles. I look 15 years older. Literally does the opposite of what it's suppose to.

I like how light it is, the price point, the volume of product, the consistency, & how long the bottle lasts. Its travel - friendly and good for all skin types. * This moisturizer is great for the summer or daytime, but personally its too lightweight for my combo skin. Its more hydrating than moisturizing and has a gel like texture. I gave it to my roommate who has oily skin and she loves it * It has helped me a lot with managing my breakouts along with clarifying toner. They really are a great combo to use. All the ingredients are clean and i havent had any type of allergic reaction. Ive scanned it the bottle for acnegenic and condemenic ingredients and it had none and then i also scanned it for toxins and it had none. Overall i would recommend to anyone unless they're specifically looking for a matteifying moisturizer. This oil free moisturizer gives you a slight sheen and glow. * New favorite!

It's gentle and leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and soothed. It's an added bonus that it smells delicious. * This is a great product for my dry, sensitive, and maturing skin. I more than likely will not purchase again. Bought 3 times before yall went and raised the price by $14. Not worth the price IMO. I feel there are better products for that price point. * I got this to keep my face from getting dry this winter. It works very well so far. The only thing I question is the fragrance, which is delightful, but probably not so good for my skin. * I wanted to love this product! The smell/texture is lovely.

Unfortunately, while sporting a ""clean ingredients"" tag and a tag from the national eczema association, I found the product to be highly irritating when I had a flare up. I only used it once during that time, and then after taking a second look at the ingredients, I found out that ""phenoxyethanol"" is a known potential allergen, irritant, potential endocrine disruptor, and the manufacturing process is highly polluting. In other countries the ""safe"" threshold for this ingredient is 1%, but it's hard to determine how much one is exposed to if applying daily/multiple times a day. Of course, there is no such regulation in US, so who knows how much is in this cream. 

At the same time I bought this, I tried products from cocokind which I highly recommend! They have a great price point and really are ""clean"" from what I have used so far, although one should always do their own research. While I was still having an eczema episode, I found using a homemade oatmeal paste + cocokind's chia seed oil was very helpful to get me through the dry itchiness. 

TLDR: not a clean product, could be irritating, check out cocokind. * I've been being treated for cancer for about a year and a half, now. Almost 6 months of that has been chemotherapy. Most products cause acne and rashes on my skin, since being on treatment. 
Pros: Did not irritate my overly sensitive skin. Smells good. I don't understand all the complaints about the smell. It is light and nice. It is kind of like marshmallows, but better. 

Cons: it moisturizes, but not enough while going through chemo. It feels great when I first put it on. But, after a few hours my skin feels tight again. Kind of like how vaseline can trick you into thinking your skin is moisturized at first. Hours later the surface of your skin feels tight and dry like a sunburn ready to peel. 

For the price, thete are much better options. Philosophy moisturizers are a lottle cheaper and give better longer lasting results for me in terms of moisture. * This is my 3rd time repurchasing this moisturizer.

The cream is too greasy feeling and has an off putting aroma. * I am now on my 3rd jar of this product and i love it so much! Id say i have combination skin that is a bit more dry in the winter, and this stuff really helps moisturize my skin without ever feeling oily. It is great under makeup and great on its own. You definitely can layer it if you want more hydration. This product is a must have for me. * I wanted to love this since I love so many of their other products. It isnt super hydrating and the smell is quite offputting. Its hard to describe, but kind of like sour play-dough. I'd return it but think its too late. * Best moisturizer ive used so far. it has and odd smell when jar is opened but the smell goes away once applied to skin * It leaves my face soooooo soft and light! After 24 hours, it still feel super soft. It doesn't make my face feel lumpy or greasy as other moisturizers. 

It does have a light smell, but it isn't a huge disgust. It's kinda like a earthy or clayish smell to me. * Osea's website markets this as being for all skin types, so I tried it. I always thought I was oily/combo skin and wanted a less greasy look so I went for this.

Turns out, either my skin may have been the dry type (this product dried it). Its hard to say. It wasnt very moisturizing and I'd say more dehydrating, as my forehead developed dehydration lines and skin overall looked dull/aged. 

Id been using a different product brand religiously for years before switching and never had any dullness, no dry skin, always bright and wrinkle free, hydrated and clear. Ultimately switched back."

A few years ago, I was able to clear up my skin with a strict morning and night routine that includes prescription creams, but every time I would try using SPF, I would immediately break out. I've tried dozens of prestige and drugstore brands! This moisturizer with SPF is the first that hasnt caused a single breakout. I've been using it for over a month now and I will continue to as long as its on shelves. * This product is okay as a moisturizer and sunscreen but leaves you shiny looking. It also does not work well under makeup at all. I learned the hard way after I was almost completely done with my makeup and it began lifting and leaving ugly peeling patches when i used a powder brush. For the price, theres way better sunscreens out there.

Works extremely well under makeup. Incorporated into my routine over a month ago and skin looks/feels great! * I bought this on a trip to Miami and it works WONDERS. My skin went from full of acne and dehydrated to super soft in just 1 week of use! I would DEFO recommend and I am looking forward to re-purchase. * Broke my skin out badly right away. * Love this product!!"

Great product! * Truly oil free. I have oily skin so I can immediately pick up on oily products. Very light weight and good texture. Best I've used so far. * Great product * I had started using the Bareminerals Skin Longevity line but didn't quite care for the daily moisturizer with sunscreen so I bought this product.  I am 60 yoa and have struggled with acne and skin problems since I was a teenager.  I believe it's mostly due to bad genes because my sisters and daughter also had acne problems. This moisturizer absorbs well, but because it is oil free, it doesn't leave my skin shiny or greasy looking. It makes my skin feel fresh and smooth. I do not look my age and I believe that using these Baremineral products contribute to my better looking skin. * I use this daily after cleansing. It is light-weight but easily covers my face & neck. It isn't oily at all. I have used other products in the past. They cause breakouts and leave my face feeling greasy all day or soak in immediately & don't create a good foundation. * Best moisture I have ever used. A little goes a long ways.  My skin has never felt or looked this good. Absolutely love this product.  Please don't ever stop selling this."

I noticed how smooth, how easy to smile it was, and what a big difference it was from the previous years. Using the whole set it's very expensive but if you are careful and use them as indicated they last.  I bought mine on October 2022 and run out of them in February 2023 bravo!!!  And that was because I had to travel to different countries so I ended taking small amounts in my containers when I when to Europe. Then on my way back I travel to Mexico so I took all the bottles because I was going to stay there 3 months. Then my set got finished there   I checked in the fine stores in Mexico but there were no Refills so I had to I'm wait till I return to USA to buy them. I'm strongly recommending the Lancôme Absolute products they all wonderful! Use them carefully and daily! * I love this product, and I've tried quite a few high end moisturizers. I'm 52 a post menopausal. I only gave it 4* because of the price, and the fragrance.  Most over the age of 50 will likely remember a bottle of White Shoulders sitting on their grandmother or mother's vanity, and that's what the smell of this cream reminds me of. Very floral and not just roses. I can live with the price, but I would definitely give it 5* if Lancôme would make a fragrance free version. The fragrance doesn't linger, but the smell reminds me of what old women smelled like when I was a child."

The product is nicely presented but it just add a layer of products to my skin with no benefit and perhaps add to my dry skin issue. * I've used several Estée Lauder skincare, especially the Daywear moisturizer with SPF for 18 years. I have combination/oily skin and as much as I loved the products I always struggled with oiliness. I decided to take a break a couple years and I regret it. My skin has significantly changed and not for the better. I tried so many new products and nothing compared. I came back to Estee Lauder and decided to try this Nutritious line, and I absolutely love it!!! This one does not make me oily or shiny and I love the way my Estee Lauder foundation sits on my skin. I will say I bought a whole regime and I'm using the Nutritious essence and moisturizer, and the Perfectionist serum and SPF. I got them on sale during Black Friday sales recently and I couldn't be happier. I can say this moisturizer is making all the difference for me. * Not for me feels to heavy * I have quite dry skin and this product just doesnt work with my skin type. Makes my face look and feel dehydrated. I can maybe understand why this would work for oily folks but not enough for dry skin. * I got this creme in the Glow kit. When I cleanse my face, I apply it as a standalone and immediately see my face turn red. I have sensitive skin, plus large pores. :( * I don't see the hype. Texture of cream felt like light face lotion and went on just the same. I've used it twice as an over night mask and I woke up with dry skin. My Elemis night cream is 5x more nourishing than this ""face mask"" cream. * I live in the Arctic and the cold sucks any moisture out of my skin. I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts from moisturizers and new products. Basically if you touch it, it's going to have issues. I received a sample of this with my last makeup order and this stuff is amazing! I have been using it as my daily moisturizer and my skin is soft, hydrated, and most of all clear!

So purchase if they have original * In my constant quest for skincare products that deliver real results, I recently tried the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid. This lotion claims to gently exfoliate, boost cell turnover, and provide deep hydration to uncover softer, smoother skin. Let's dive into my experience with this multi-tasking formula.

The lotion is non-greasy and lightweight, making it perfect for daily use. It absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving it feeling soft and hydrated without any heavy residue. The product is fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for those with sensitive skin or a sensitivity to strong scents. The natural smell from the lactic acid salts is subtle and varies slightly depending on your skin's unique pH, but it's not overpowering or unpleasant. * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is revolutionary! It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body."

It is kinda crazy because I've been using Bare Minerals makeup for 25+ years and never considered the skin care products. On impulse, I picked this up and I'm really glad I did. My skin is really happy. In two weeks it has reduced redness, dryness, and you can't see the lines on my forehead anymore.

Yes, it does pill if it is not the last step in your routine. It is my 2nd to last step, and depending on how long I wait to apply the oil afterwards, affects how intensely the moisturizer pills. The moisture and effectiveness is worth it though. If I can't give a good 10 minutes before applying oil, then I will just skip the oil that night. * Biggest disappointment from Ulta so far… not moisturizing… for some reason it dehydrates my skin… dont waste your $$$ * This works great! A little goes a very long way. It's very moisturizer yet not oily. I love this night cream. * Doesn't absorb into the skin as quickly as I would like, but once it is, my face and neck are so bright and refreshed. * Keep The Phenoxyethanol out of products please! 
If Europe can ban Endocrine disruptors why cant we. 
This is like the only ""clean brand"" in the states. So dissapponting.. * I have combo acne prone skin for reference. 
This is like a light watery lotion but absorbs like a rich cream. It soaks right in and paces a velvety, supple feeling that I love. Sometimes my skin is drier so I could see me being able to use this during the day also without being too heavy. It does have a scent. It's like candy strawberry and flowers. It's light and goes away very shortly. You only need a little of this because it spreads so well. It can be easy to go overboard. I think this is definitely worth the money given the ingredients, packaging and how long this will last. Especially compared to other creams. I don't breakout but wake up with super soft, nourished skin. * I want to love this product so badly but the fragrance/essential oils in this caused my eczema to flare up. I'm so sad but I know it's on me for buying something with fragrance, natural or not. Otherwise I think it's a nice product it wasn't drying or anything and the texture is really nice just wish they had a fragrance free version. I will stick with the vegan ceremide cream"

This hit the spot. It does feel more like a sunscreen due to the texture and smell, but it also gives a moisturized feeling after your am routine and doesn't feel drying. I don't often leave reviews, but as I am about to purchase my 3rd tube, I thought it was worthy! * I've been using this sunscreen for monyhs now. Im on my 4th bottle and I absolutely love it! I have extremely oily skin that's very sensitive. This product not only goes on like a dream and absorbs quickly(which is great for my inpatient rushes lol.) But it also helps mattify under primer and control my oily skin a bit. Now does it completely stop oil breakthroughs No! But lets be real there isn't a single matte or oil free product that will. It takes a routine and work if your skin is like mine. But now I'm being recommended to use physical(mineral) sunscreen due to my melasma. I'm struggling to find one that will work for my skin type and hating letting this one go! Highly recommend this product if you want a good matte, sheer, daily sunscreen. * I have been enjoying this! I have been using it for 2 months now. I'm always on the hunt for a good SPF/moisturizer duo just because I am trying not to add more steps to my skincare routine. Often times, at least with cheaper ones, they leave my face very shiny. Even after hours of wearing this one, I don't see my skin very greasy at all! It's worth a try, especially for this price point! * It goes on smooth and feels great. Unfortunately, the smell is so strong and unpleasant. I scrubbed my face twice after using and it's still awful. * I was advised to use this by my esthetician.  I have been using thos for a while now and i really like it. I have oily skin and i like thst it has SPF in it. I need to use items with SPF already in it, or ill forget. * After reading all the promises I thought this SPF would be perfect, but like other reviews mention this doesnt dry matte at all and I need to use a powder after applying. For the high price this should do what it says. Sounds like there was some sort of change in the formula that ruined it. * This was recommended by my esthetician. And it works well for me. I like that it has sun screen in it and it doesnt seem to make my face oily at all. It works for me."

Cleanser feels clean w/o stripping. The extolment stings and works! The moisturizer also stings a bit but feels great on! Sensitive skin beware. * This is a great deal! Yes, the one product is smaller than they said in the details, but all of these still last a long time. The face wash has a really nice light citrus smell. I havent used the moisturizer yet because I couldnt read what it was exactly or when to use it (before looking it up) because the white writing on the transparent container was impossible to read on top of being partially rubbed off.

And I never wanted to blame the product, but my skin (around my nose especially) has always been way too sensitive for toner—any use results in irritation and painful white bumps. Til now, with this toner. It's the only one that has allowed me to achieve clarity/defeat acne before it starts AND make my skin feel soothed and happy. Will be sticking with this as long as the formula stays the same. * I love this toner!! Ive used not only on myself but other people and I see a difference, definitely recommend to others😁 * I try other Toners and always go back to this one. I don't think I will even bother trying any new toners since this one checks all the boxes and my skin feels smoother and cleaner with this product * One of the best milky toners it is so underrated!

I noticed new packaging at some point but thought it was the same product because it didnt say it wasnt. It did its job as an every day  sun screen, moisturized and worked well under makeup. The last  two bottles purchased have had a weird and unpleasant texture with random teeny tiny and sharp! little crystals that are invisible but feel awful on the skin. Really bad...! The first bottle with this issue I  thought was just a fluke...bad batch  or expired. Also I noticed some pilling with make up but not all the time. I thought it might be another product causing the pilling. Now with the 2nd, current and last bottle the same way I will not be repurchasing. It's expensive (for me) so I will finish the current bottle but it's frustrating to have to find something else that works as well as the origional version. * somehow gives me cold sores? havent had them since childhood but the moment i started using this, they came back--never again. the new formula is awful, never buy it. * This lotion with spf is my new favorite! It goes on smooth and isn't greasy. My skin feels hydrated, and I have a dark spot that has gotten significantly lighter. I highly recommend this lotion! 

Aveeno, please don't change this formula ever!! * I am happy this product does not dry out my skin, but I don't feel it will protect my face from sunburn.  That being said, my face was peeling because of the high strength of my lotion. At least it is now not peeling. * The moisturizer did help with my overall skin/was a decent moisturizer, but the pilling is/was so bad, almost constant, even hours after application. It also doesn't sit well under any make-up, even a just light skin tint. The smell is strong, but it honestly just smells like soap so that wasn't an issue for me and I kind of liked it. * This product is light and smells good.  I love that it has SPF. * I've used it for over 10 years. There's been changes with it over the years, but my skin soaks it up like a sponge and leaves me glowing."

I never put it around my eyes and was still getting that stinging feeling. Also, the tint of this is pointless. It doesnt offer any coverage. I typically use the pore perfecting primer, which leaves my skin way better looking. * Please dont buy it !!! Will burn your skin ! 😭 * When I first applied it I was very excited and loved how it felt and looked. But as I was finishing rubbing it in I touched another part of my face where I had already applied the sunscreen and it pilled. So I put more on and didn't touch it for a couple of hours. Before even checking again my eyes were burning so bad, but a lot of sunscreens do that to me, if I like a sunscreen well enough I will just use another sunscreen that doesn't burn my eyes around my eyes and the other for the rest of my face. When I checked it again it still pilled, I can't even  imagine trying to wear makeup over this. Just so some will understand, I put plenty of time between my moisturizer and applying the sunscreen, I made my bed, folded a load of laundry and put a full dishwasher load of dishes away, plenty of time. All I can say is I'm glad I didn't spend money on this, I got a sample. I definitely don't recommend. * This spf ruined my entire day. It made my eyes burn so bad that I had to remove an entire face if makeup in the car because I couldn't see without my eyes watering. * I received a small sample of this.

I thought all those people were just sensitive; it couldn't be that bad. Oh no no: it is entirely that bad. Don't get me wrong: I love the gel texture for my combination oily skin, and the product has a great cooling sensation and absorbs well. BUT the fragrance, y'all! I am not sensitive to scents, but the floral scent is pungent and overpowering. It's the sole reason I will not repurchase, and it's too bad because it's an otherwise great product. * I've been using this for about 3 weeks now. I really enjoy the product and like my skin doesn't feel super greasy. My only minor issue, is the smell is a bit odd for me, it's very tolerable it's just a bit odd for me.

It does nothing for my skin… super greasy, no firming, and makes my skin look worse. For the price I expected at least a decent product. In my opinion there are SO many great moisturizers out there that out perform this and are cheaper. * Bought this because I like the day cream version a lot.  This however was just not a great formulation for me.  It simply NEVER absorbs into my skin and then it just rubs off on my pillow case or hands eventually.   And I don't use an excessive amount because of the price tag.  I'm a big fan of using the minimal amount required.  It's too late to return it, so it's just going to move into my graveyard of products that I can't bare to throw away because, $$$, but just don't work on my skin.  Le sigh.  But, I still love the extra firming day cream and all my other Clarins products.  I would recommend trying a sample of this before buying if possible so you know if it's a good consistency for your skin. * Excellent result 👍 * Light weight, non greasy.  Plant enriched.  Vegan.

281,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial advanced repair barrier cream,pimprod2036682,2603779," * I have purchased many different creams, lotions and serums trying to find one that truly replenishes my skin. So many lay on top and you end up dry a few hours later but this Kiehls repair cream absorbs and leaves my mature dry skin hydrated throughout my long shifts * this product is the only thing that helped resolve the contact dermatitis/eczema on and around my eyes. i went to the derm and the stuff they prescribed me did nothing. this was single handedly responsible for clearing up my skin. ive gone through 4 tubes. a little goes a long way * I have sensitive skin, rosacea and acne. This product doesn't irritate my skin, which most products do. I love it in the winter and it also helps with my redness. It doesn't sit on my skin and feels soft after applying. The only downside, the container doesn't appear to be full of product and for the price, that would be nice. * Good but expensive and not much product!! * Pricey for the small amount you get but it definitely feels amazing and a little goes a long way!! * This product has helped save my skin! Wearing the mask during Covid killed my skin barrier and I have not been able to revive it. Every product I have tryed has given me cystic acne or i have had a horrible reaction to it. And just when I thought all hope was lost this 💎 was recommended to me. I was a little weary as its a cream and feels like a balm. I am oily to combo and anything thick just make we more oily. This absorbs great as long as you dont over use it so find your sweet spot. Start out with a little cuz it goes a long way. This helps Hydrate my skin while I useing active to clear it up my breakouts. * While it does feel nice initially when you put it on that fades quickly and just makes my face feel tight. Absolutely not worth the price point. There are more hydrating options out there."

My 33 year old skin looks phenomenal! It's so moisturizing and soft on my skin with a beautiful glow. * Easily the BEST anti-aging deeply hydrating moisturizer I've ever used!!!! I've not only purchased the entire live for myself but family members and it's worth every penny. A LITTLE goes a long way! * The best face cream I have ever used. * This face cream was so expensive and I felt it didn't work for me. It made my face very sensitive and my foundation didn't stay well on top it. I was disappointed but will try something new. * I am loving the results of these products. * I've tried MANY MANY moisturizers. this one is THE BEST hands down! Use it day 1 and your face feels like a babys butt the very next day. That's how fast and amazing this stuff works. Nothing will make your skins feel this soft and supple. And no breakouts! (a few moisturizers make me break out for some reason but not this) The only downside is the price; it's horrendously expensive so I hafta wait until my bday & xmas gift cards and rewards points to buy it so I only buy it about once a year. A little goes along way so I can make it last a few months. I'm 56 with normal to dry skin. * I have used it for a week now. Like the way my skin feels I use it at night. Packaging is a little over the top. Contents is a lot smaller than it appears from the outside.

Started using one this past week and it has changed. It's no longer moisturizing and burns when applying. It's too late to return so the two jars are a waste of money. The new formula is BAD! * I bought this a few weeks ago hoping to find my new go-to winter moisturizer, but unfortunately this is a miss for me. My skin isn't particularly sensitive, but this moisturizer burns my cheeks when I put it on. Unfortunately I won't be re-purchasing. * They changed the formula. 
I've been using for 4 years now.
Highly disappointed  w/ formula change... it smells stink, now burns my skin and does not leave my skin glowing / moisturized like it use to.
I will not repurchase. * Was using for the last two years. Recently opened a jar purchased a few months ago, noticed the color and texture differ from previous jars. My face seems dryer now and a bit of burning occurs after uses. Sucks! Was in love with this moisturerizer. I will have to use something else now. * It's leaving my skin dry instead of moisture something has changed. I'm going to go back to Clinique . I"

I wanted to try something new and saw good reviews for this product so I gave it a try and truly wish I hadn't. This moisturizer is heavy and sticky. It leaves my skin feeling…. just gross. It made my skin break out in these weird tiny bumps and caused an acne flare up. I would not recommend this product. * this is a very nice moisturizer BUT it pills horribly. it messes up the makeup i put on top of it everytime. no matter how much i rubbed it in. will be returned. * Melts onto my skin. Doesn't feel heavy * As someone who struggles with rosacea, its hard to find skincare I like. This moisturizes, calms, and makes my skin feel soft and supple without making it feel greasy.

After multiple uses, I can confidently say that this product does nothing for me (literally). My skin feels no different when I put it on, and I haven't noticed it making my makeup look better or last longer compared to not wearing a primer at all. The cooling effect makes it not for use around the eyes, but that's exactly where I need my primer to focus on my concealer. Disappointed that NYX traded their Angel Veil shelf space for this product line… definitely not worth the price tag! * I really found this primer to be cooling soothing, and just overall a very good quality product before applying foundation. I would definitely buy it again. * Would not buy  this again..reminded me of that menthol bio freeze cream that's been water down about 90 percent..its aweful..it took forever to stop that feeling..and it made my eyes burn..even though I didn't put on eyes.. * I'm obsessed with this product.  The texture is like nothing I've ever felt.  It's somehow soft and fluffy/bouncy feeling but oh so cooling and hydrating on the skin.  I love it so much and use daily.  Will definitely repurchase! * Use daily * Great moisturizer/primary. I just put a serum on and then use this. It goes on smooth and lasts all day with no oil even though i have combo oily skin.

Sometimes my skin fees a litte dry when its a dry day. I love how this also acts like a primer, my makeup stays on really well when I use this. * I got this wanting a moisturizer with spf since I have tinted moisturizer for makeup. This was not what I was hoping it would be. It was really sticky and it didn't really feel like moisturizer. I ended up returning. * I have very sensitive dry skin, I've been searching for over a year for the perfect mineral sunscreen that doesn't cause acne or dry me out, I think I've finally found it!!! it can feel greasy when you first put it on but quickly absorbs. I reapply throughout the day, and honestly LOVE this product. it's so amazing. I bought it on a whim thinking I would end up hating it too like all the others I've tried, but I believe I found my sunscreen!!! I've been using it for almost 3 weeks multiple times throughout the day!! * I love this sunscreen because of the high Zinc Oxide for UBA/UVA rays and the ingredients make me glow! It absorbs pretty quickly and you won't feel oily as the day goes on. No eye irritation. It does reflect the sun light away from your skin. * 100% my favorite ever. Yuka has it wrong I looked up the ingredients myself and this one is my favorite. * Horrible product it gave me a rash. Supper greasy and leaves a white cast. Waist of money"

I have redness/combination  and sensitive skin and not only did it help with my redness but my skin immediately absorbed it and at no point did i feel oily. A must have! * Best moisturizer I've used and I've used many.  A little goes a long way. * Ive been using this product for about a year now (i think) maybe a few months less than that.. I do like it, I can feel how it seems to be tightening my skin.. But, i havent noticed any difference. I have noticed at the very top where my hair line is, it gets super dry. I am not sure if it is the moisturizer or what but i have tried several different shampoos and conditioners and still have the problem. But i havent tried a different moisturizer yet. The smell does not bother me, it does smell good. I do feel like it isn't as moisturizing as it should be though… I really wish I could find the old Chanel Hydra Micro Creme! 

Honestly, I believe this moisturizer just depends on your skin type. I use it with my Chanel foundation.. I am still iffy about it because I feel like it also shows my ""fine lines"" more but I am not very good with all of this anyway. Lol * I unfortunately have sensitive skin, I find the fragrance to be irritating on me. Plus I have a bit of a break out coming in from hormones. I've been trying it for a while, I really wanted to love it. * Best product ever. * The No 1 Chanel line is phenomenal. I have 3 products now and will continue to add more. This is just what my ""mature"" skin needed. 
Thank you Katarina…Chanel and Ulta are lucky to have such a professional, knowledgeable and kind associate! * I got this as a sample and I immediately bought it once it ran out. I live in the desert so my skin gets really dry with the weather here, this moisturizer has been the only thing that's been able to hydrate my skin without leaving it greasy and my pores look like they're getting smaller. I'm pretty selective when it comes to spending money but this was well worth it."

Not only was it a great moisturiser it also workwd great as a primer for under my make-up * This glow primer is so beautiful alone but under makeup it's incredible. Only thing is kinda pricey but what isnt * This with the Tula Glowscreen.. 👍🏼👍🏼
GAME CHANGING * It burns and apparently I'm not alone. I don't have very sensitive skin. This immediately made my face hot and stingy. Then the oil production kicked up. This is not wearable for me. * I mix this with my sunscreen and foundation. It gives a subtle glow and a bit  of moisture. For reference I have oily skin and ive had no issues incorporating into my makeup routine. * I've tried their regular moisturizer before & I loved it. However, this makes me feel like my skin is burning when I put it on. it's not too moisturing either."

After 1 use my skin barrier was destroyed, I had a horrible rash on my jawline, and peeling dry skin for multiple days. I do not have sensitive skin… use retinol and have never had a reaction like this before. * I was unsure of this product because of active ingredients. Patch test was fine, but my skin became leathery and sensitive within a week of use, but week 2 destroyed my skin barrier and gave me a rash. My skin was red and painful. Do not recommend. * If you have the money, this moisturizer has a great dispenser and is moisturizing with being too greasy. Not sure I would purchase this at full price though * My skin looks and feels softer& smoother with this cream. I love the light citrus scent! The dispenser is also great for avoiding contamination and spoilage of product. I also use it on the backs of my hands to hopefully discourage age spots down the road. * I do not have 'sensitive skin' type and yet this severly dried out my skin and it felt painful like a sunburn. I gave it a few tries I thought my skin was drying out because of the cooler weather but nope, this was the culprit! I cannot even fathom paying full price for this product. * I dont like the scent. It smells good when you're putting it on, but then it makes your pillow smell like wet dog. This dried out my face horribly and created big dry patches under my eyes and above my eyelids. I have to return it. * My skin is extremely sensitive to new products, especially retinols. This took a few weeks to get used to, but I'm now using it almost every night. My skin has SO much more life to it!"

Obviously, it gets no complaints from me. * I love Dermalogica moisturizers. I got this initially as a sample. I was happy with how smoothly it went on and didn't leave an SPF scent. Purchased a couple on sale so I could have in my stash! * Yes I would purchase this spf over and over it does what it says ! * From using this regime my skin has been so much nicer * This product line is always so consistent and keeps my skin looking younger * Unfortunately this is least favorite product ive ever tried! The smell is very strong (old granny perfume), burned and irritated my eyes even though i was careful around that area, broke me out so bad it took months to recover and has a slight whitecast. The upside is that its a high spf and is really convenient to have a 2 in 1 product. Unfortunately I will never repurchase again unless its completely and totally reformulated"

I'm a skincare junkie and I try new moisturizers all the time, but I always come back to this. The texture is PERFECT. It's a lightweight gel-cream but still as deeply moisturizing as a rich cream. A lot of gel creams dry down to nothing after an hour or two but this stays a lonnnng time. I literally use it like a nighttime rich cream, that's how nourishing it is. I tried the new vitamin c cream from Olehenriksen but its not as good as this OG one. May they never ever discontinue or reformulate! * My skin never looked better since using this entire line * you have no idea how many moisturizers I tried in my life and this became in my top 3. omg the glow I get with this is unreal. i get so many compliments from people about my skin when I use it. it doesn't break me out, it actually helped me clear my skin ! i will buy this again and again and I hope they will not change the formula! * I went on a trip and only brought this moisturizer for face and body. I got a little sunburn and used this and the burn went away over night with no peeling. I will forever use this as my after sun lotion. Highly recommend. * After using this product once I woke up the next morning with severe redness and achne-like bumps over my entire face!! I wanted to itch my face off it was so bad. Once I removed the product my face started to calm down. My skin is never sensitive like this, but it did NOT like this product what-so-ever!! * I wouldn't say that I am a fan of any skincare product, I hope they just do their job. Nothing has floored me like this skincare line. I bought this moisturizer because I bought the eye cream a couple weeks ago and LOVED IT. I can actually feel these products working on my skin. I've been blessed with normal skin and I can actually feel the benefits of this product. I feel moisturized and my skin feels ""alive"". I would highly recommend. * Big fan of Ole Henriksen products. I've tried them all and while its hard to choose a favorite, this is my go-to. It smells great (like a fresh orange) and feels even better. My skin just looks younger and better."
298,amlactin,daily vitamin c lotion with 7% lactic acid aha,pimprod2043811,2623399," * Completely smoothed out my bumpy upper arms. Also use it to lighten my hyperpigmented armpits and knees and it has helped. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate or burn. Wherever you apply it, your skin will be crazy smooth. Smell is not the most pleasant but it's also not as bad. And with the results i see I personally don't care about the smell. * I purchased this on a whim after reading about products known to help with KP, and it totally works!! It does have a clinical smell to it, but it goes away after a few minutes.

I get bumps and rough texture on my upper arms, thighs, back, and butt and have used this product in all places. I use a body scrubber in the shower and use this lotion on damp skin immediately after getting out.

I have noticed a massive difference on my arms-- they are nearly perfectly smooth, with the odd clogged pore every so often. While the rest of my skin has seen improvement, it has not been nearly as effective as on my arms-- I think this may be related to my ability to actually exfoliate those areas effectively. I am plus sized, so those areas of my body are just softer. I think if I were to use a scrubber that gave me more leverage and then applied this, I would see even more of a difference. * This stuff works! I get dry, scaly, red patches on my shins and the backs of my arms in the winter, and this is the ONLY thing I have found that helps. Seriously after two days the scaling on my arms was GONE! The patches on my legs are taking a little longer but it is improving every day, and the redness is fading.
It doesn't smell very nice. I know it's because they don't add any artificial fragrance and what you are smelling is the natural scent of the active ingredients. To get around that I mix it with some scented dry body oil.
I will keep using this! Bring it on, high-elevation dry winter climate, I found your match! * Purchased based on 5 star reviews but it smells like self tanner. I can not get passed the smell at all. it does feel very hydrating even after first use. * As a beauty enthusiast always on the lookout for products that truly make a difference, I was excited to try the AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid. This lotion promises a lot—gentle exfoliation, brightening effects, and hydration—all while being safe for sensitive and acne-prone skin. 

By the end of the week, my skin looked more even-toned, and some of my dark spots had started to fade. The gentle exfoliation from the lactic acid helped in renewing my skin without causing any irritation or redness—a common issue I face with more aggressive exfoliants. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid exceeded my expectations! This dynamic blend of lactic acid and vitamin C not only brightens my complexion but also gently exfoliates. My skin feels smoother and looks more radiant. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula makes it ideal for use under makeup. This lotion has swiftly become one of my top choices for achieving a glowing, healthy appearance. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C is perfect for my normal to dry skin. It also brightens and evens out my skin. I love to apply it when my legs are out for a natural glow!"

My skin gets a little too dry with all facewash but this one made it softer.Hopefully I can stay with this face wash. * After 1st small application my face began to burn. I had to wash it off. Returned it to the store. This one is not for me but Olay doesn't make it easy to know which one of their products to use. * I purchased this moisturizer from Ulta and it arrived within a few days. I use the product both morning and evening even if I am supposed to only use it once a day. My skin appears brighter and it is definitely smoother. I even use it on my neck but so far I haven't noticed a difference there. * This smooths my face and doesn't cause breakouts which so many moisturizers do. I haven't found a moisturizer yet that doesn't break me out. It lasts all day and works well underneath your makeup or by itself. I definitely plan on continuing to use this. * A couple months back I went on vacation to the Bahamas where my skin ended up breaking out very badly.  I brought this moisturizer with. It felt like my face was burning off and every time I took a shower more skin peeled off my face. It was the most miserable time ever. I assumed it had something to do with the trip. A couple days ago I tried this product again, the next morning the same thing happened, immediately this time. My face is burning, feels hot to the touch, bright red and is breaking out with little bumps all over and starting to do that gross oozy thing again. Now I realize it's this moisturizer. It might be awesome on some, just not me. I really wanted to like this product but I wouldn't wish this horrible reaction on anybody. So I guess just be cautious and if you notice something doesn't feel right, stop using it immediately. * This stuff isnt just great for your face, but can work on other sensitive areas too. I had dark marks/hyperpigmentation left behind from a medical adhesive left on my thigh too long, and this genuinely helped to fade those lines to a point where they are less noticeable"

I do find that I get clogged pores if I consecutively use the product. * I'm 40 with combo skin and this stuff is awesome! I don't know why I waited so long to get it! I can't wait to try more of Chanel skin care because this did not disappoint. I can't believe how soft and hydrated my skin looked. * Absolute favorite! Feel complete with it. * I use this before my foundation and I get so many compliments about how my face looks as soft as a baby! It truly makes my face feel soft and look better than ever with makeup, I don't look cakey. I use this with a water-based mac foundation and set with a charlotte tilburry powder. * 1st time I purchased this.  Great for Arizona summers. * Nice light not too heavy. Light scent. Does not irritate my sensitive skin. Calming. Definitely a favorite face cream. * I bought this and absolutely love it!! I will definitely buy it again!!"

No aloe listed, but definitely not the moisturizing I need. Just another expensive product to put in the pile of products I have paid for that I can't use. * Yes, I know the packaging isn't sexy or exciting. And no, this product probably isn't trending on Tiktok at the moment. However, this is one of the absolute best and most luxurious face creams I've ever used, and at a desirable price point. It leaves my cracked, painful and psoriasis-prone face plump, dewy, glowy and hydrated for the entire day or night. It performs better than the majority of my high end brand creams do and is extremely gentle. Highly recommend trying. * It moisturizes my skin too much! It looks great under makeup, you wake up as if you had just washed your face, I love it! Super moisturizing. * I am of the darker persuasion in her late 30s and it is hard to find a moisturizer that does not over power you with the smell. But this, this one is lovely. It goes on like butter ladies. Trust me it blends well with other products too. * This cream smells like the airplane cabin bathroom pink hand soap, which is slightly offputting. It also feels thick and heavy without seeming to sufficiently moisturize my face, so I think this formula just isn't for me."

It leaves a beautiful glow and deeply hydrates but again, not for oily skin or if you leave in hot weather.Too heavy for a day cream * I got this product with high hopes. It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy. I don't like the packaging, but i've noticed a lot of brands going this route so its whatever. I would recommend it though."

I use this in the mornings before applying makeup/skin tints and I never need to use a primer with it! Fungal acne safe! * The only CON about this moisturizer is that it is pretty sticky/ tacky while patting it onto the face to absorb as it starts dries. My skin is pretty sensitive so it starts to hurt when it starts getting tacky. If it wasn't so sticky, I would love it more. Overall, I still do like this moisturizer. It hasn't gave me bad rash or broke me out badly. I like that it's fragrance free and silicone free. I never really cared about the ingredients of skin products before and just used whatever. However, I have become more aware of the things I use as my skin condition has started to change since I've reached my 30's. I will buy this again. * I wanted to like this so much. But it is so sticky no matter what i do. I have combination skin, but cant use anything with oil in it or I break out. But this did nothing to hydrate my skin. It claims to hydrate without leaving skin sticky- but it did the exact opposite for me. * PEACH & LILY Glass Skin Water-Gel Moisturizer Is a god send. It is so light weight and adsorbs quickly into your skin with no sticky feel * I have oily skin and I regret not trying this moisturizer sooner. It provides the skin with hydration without the feeling of stickiness or oiliness throughout the day. Way better than my Tatcha Water Cream. Will repurchase this one to wear in the AM! * I have had oily or combination skin my whole life. Never used moisturizer before, since my face looks very youthful and most moisturizing products made me break out. I older now, and need moisturizer-this is the best product ever! * It really does leave your skin looking like glass! And no oil buildup throughout day. I breakout using just about anything on my face, I have not broken out once in 6 months using this brands glass skin line."

Long term use gave me dryness and temporary wrinkles. It might be due to my climate. * So moisturizing and i have noticed a huge difference in my skin when i wake up, softer and clearer. I have oily acne prone skin and I've experienced no breakouts or excess oil during the day. * I got this whole line on a whim and i can definitely say its healed my skin barrier and got rid of my acne. This stuff goes on smooth and feels so good on my face, i wake up very refreshed, the spf in the morning version is a plus. Thank you ROC🧡😁 * I've been struggling with adult acne for about 2 years now. One of the things I've learned is if your skin barrier is shot - you're not going to heal your acne. This product has significantly improved my skin for the better. It truly does what it says: improves skin barrier. It also will help heal a breakout literally overnight which is amazing!"

Ive been consistently using it for about two weeks now for some fine lines in my forehead and its made such a difference. My forehead looks so smooth and my skin is so moisturized. I love this cream. This is a new staple in my skincare routine. * Like the richness and feel of this product. This is my first time using this in my routine but I really like it and I am seeing a smoother face in the a.m. I am a ROC user and love their products. * I love the way it feels on my face. It is not oily or greasy. I haven't used it long enough to notice if it helps with wrinkles but I will let you know later. Some moisturizers feel sticky when you put it on, this one does not. It also has a nice smell to it. * I have been using this Hydrating cream for over one year now. I like how it works and how it makes my skin feel. * found this product on sale and thought I would give it a try, and so far, I really like it - feels nice and haven't had any bad reactions, nice find * Wow! I was blown away by how effective this max hydration cream by ROC is! When you first apply this you can feel it deeply hydrating your skin. It's fast absorbing and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. After about a week of use i started to notice a slight reduction of my visible fine lines and wrinkles. After about 3 weeks to a month of use I have much firmer skin. This cream is amazing!

311,no7,radiance+ vitamin c daily brightening moisturizer,pimprod2020107,2574176," * feels light and easy to apply * Great moisturizer and love how this makes my face feel but the fragrance is overwhelmingly strong. * The product is good but I was hoping for more hydration.
Also, the service at this store is awful you have to go on an adventure to find someone to help you.     Was over charged and had to come all the way back. * I just wish you had a face cleanser too every time I look for it it's always out * Works perfect for my skin type. Im normal to oily. * Works perfect for my skin type. Im normal to oily. * This is a thing that I searched for very light weight non sticky and effective"
312,fresh,rose & hyaluronic acid lightweight moisturizer,pimprod2038854,2608278," * Lightweight, delicate scent, great ingredients. Love it. * This moisturizer is lightweight but does have a bit of a tacky texture immediately after application. I use 2 pumps for my face and neck after the shower or after I've washed my face. The product is absorbed pretty quickly after. It's pretty much my only skincare product other than a face wash and sunscreen. My oily t-zone and dry cheeks have really balanced out with regular use of this. The scent is a light rose and not overpowering. * Lovely rose scent and did not activate my rosacea redness. Great for light daily moisture coverage use after cleansing. * I have acne but also dry skin and this product was a solution for good hydration without adding any oil on my face. VERY good for moisturizing before doing your makeup. I live in Boston but also part in Florida and this product does not fail me. * I really wanted to love this. It smells amazing, it goes on feeling really nice and moisturizing. a little goes a long way. But the dry down is where it gets bad. it feels tacky and sticky and a weird gritty feeling that i just can't get past. It's hard to really describe but i just know i do not like how my skin feels after using this. I can't decide if i want to return it immediately or give it a chance for a week. It was a lot of money to spend to not love a product i use twice a day. * There's something about this that just feels a little luxurious. I purchased this on a black Friday sale otherwise I don't think I would've spent the money. Now that I've used it I will definitely repurchase in the future, even at the regular cost because I think it is worth it. I have oily skin and most moisturizers leave my skin oily because they are just too thick and creamy. This moisturizer is very thin and watery and glides on your face very smoothly and doesn't leave me feeling oily. I'm also a big fan of the rose smell. * this product is incredible!so glowy and hydrating!! also feels so luxurious!"
313,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial moisturizer spf 30,pimprod2002927,2536697," * A great product. * This may be a decent moisturizer for winter or indoor not sweating use. Do not use for outdoor activities. It will burn your eyes SO badly. I don't have sensitive eyes or skin but I was practically blind on a summer hike. Horrible! I expect more from a brand like this. * I do have to say I only just tried this product so I'm unsure if it will break me out in the future. However it feels lovely on my skin. Before I applied this product I had some slight dry patches on my skin and it noticeably reduced the dryness. It didn't leave any white cast on my skin (I do have very fair skin though) and it made my skin looks very dewy and glowing! I would definitely recommend this product :) * I really do not understand the bad reviews. This is a great moisturizer with SPF in it. I personally like an all in one product and with 4.2 ounces you get a good value for your money. Not only does this have great ingredients, it is hydrating, sinks into your skin very easily, doesn't leave a white cast, and does not make your eyes burn. My skin glows after applying and it also wears SO well under makeup!! I do not find this sunscreen to be greasy at all. It actually makes me less oily throughout the day compared to the other SPF moisturizer I was using previously. I was using the Cerave AM lotion but wasn't in love with it as it took a lot of TLC to blend in and made my makeup pill. I was recommended this product by a friend and I am so glad I bought this. For those concerned about fragrance I notice a very very slight sunscreen smell but it doesn't bother me and I am someone who is sensitive to scents. This is a chemical sunscreen so some people may be sensitive to that. I am someone who isn't. I prefer chemical sunscreens anyway because they usually do not leave a white cast and are more hydrating. Mineral sunscreens are always too drying for my skin and leave too much of a whitecast. * I love this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I just love how it applies and how moisturized my skin feels afterwards. * It's ok. Def more of a sunscreen feel. Doesn't leave a white cast but takes a while to soak in. I have to wait quite awhile before I can begin applying my makeup. Like a lot of Kiehl's products but won't buy this one again. * I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now and I swear by it. I put it on in the morning before applying my makeup and it works perfectly. I've found that some moisturizers make my foundation look kinda wonky, but my makeup goes on top of this one nicely. Also, I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this product. I'm never going back!"
314,cetaphil,hydrating moisturizing cream body moisturizer,pimprod2028655,2586929," * This cream is thick but absorbs well into my skin. I have eczema and this is perfect for my body as well as my face. It leaves my body and face feeling soft and moisturized all day. * My go to for when im feeling dry - doesnt leave you too greasey but for the first few minutes you will stay a little greasy. Example, if i use my computer mouse pad it will leave it greasey. * I am into very very dry skin. Its greasy n geavy when applied. A big Nooo * I am into very very dry skin. Its greasy n geavy when applied. A big Nooo * I had a compromised skin barrier and flaky skin and I used this as a final layer in my skincare to lock in moisture. I wish I would've started with this in the beginning of fall. Highly recommend for very dry skin. I didn't love the texture on my body but would highly recommend for the face at night. * Fixed my winter lizard skin. Will be buying again and again * I started using retinol months ago, and my skin was so irritated that I had to put moisturizer on every hour to not be in pain. My dermatologist gave me a sample of the Cetaphil cream and I love it. I repackage it in a squeeze bottle for easier application."
315,la roche-posay,pure vitamin c anti-wrinkle firming moisturizing filler,pimprod2019700,2574392," * This product goes on so smooth. Just enough of moisture. Really like it. * Not too greasy, perfect for combination skin. Helped minimize fine lines after minths of use . * Although I enjoy the smell, the bottle is manufactured so terribly that even the lightest pressure expels the cream outside and under the lid. It is already half way gone with only using it a half full of times because the lid does not lock and stay in place! Highly disappointed. * I need C10 now! * Vitamin C does wonders for your skin. I use this for daytime care in conjunction with the Redermic R in the evening. It's a great combo ! * I use Redermic C every morning as my moisturizer.  I put it on, let it stay on a few minutes to absorb, and then apply my foundation and other makeup. * I use for 1 year and my skin now looks better, my Dermatologist recommended it 👌🏼"

317,estÃ©e lauder,revitalizing supreme+ bright power soft crÃ¨me moisturizer,pimprod2030767,2591239," * Great for someone who wants to even their skin tone or correct dark spots. visibly brightens complexion * Huge fan of Revitalizing Supreme + Youth Power Creme so naturally i love this too! The idea that it helps to brighten the skin without Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) won me over. I find Vitamin C can be too aggressive on my skin. * I love this moisturizer! Its my favorite to use day in and day out. It has an extremely soft, lightweight texture so its great for daily, but also has so many brightening, moisturizing, and mild resurfacing properties, its also great for my evening regimen as well. Ive noticed a lot of my dark spots evening out, and my skins surface looking more ""glass"" like. The Vitamin C & Beautyberry in this work together so well to be brightening & moisturizing. This is definitely one of my HOLY GRAILS!! * I seen a significant difference in my dark spots with this product! * This cream is amazing! It even tone my skin and took care of the dark spots. I've been it regularly, and I love the feeling of smooth and find lines! * Love how my skin looks more even * I do not have sensitive skin and this product made me break out. I'm 56 and never had acne issues. I do not recommend this"
318,belif,aqua bomb brightening vitamin c cream,pimprod2043263,2619878," * First, the packaging is misleading for these lotions. The lotion inside is only as wide as the narrow part of the cap. Im not sure why they have this packaged like a big tub of lotion when its not. They should save the extra unnecessary packaging and also not have it be so misleading. 
The lotion itself isnt great - i have very slightly sensitive skin and this lotion makes my redness come out. Will not be repurchasing * belif has just never been a brand to let me down. I can't believe I had never tried this moisturizer though! It's so soft and pillowy and hydrates the skin beautifully. It sits so well under Makeup and has this soft but heavenly smell. I mean from the first try, thus knocked everything else out for me. I 1000%  recommend. * This moisturizer worked for my face and gave me a little glow. I am disappointed that it's not sold in stores anymore. * I'm VERY picky about moisturizers, and my skin tends to be slightly acne-prone but is also extremely dehydrated. I've used the Aqua Bomb from this brand and LOVED it, so the Vitamin C was a must-try. It has the silkiest texture, and absorbs beautifully into the skin while also leaving it looking and feeling plump and bouncy. I did notice that my post-acne marks cleared up much more quickly with this, and it didnt seem to exacerbate existing acne while providing me with deep hydrating through the winter months. If you are oily, this may not be for you, but for me it was a 10/10! * Smells like iced lemon sugar cookie. Feels veey light on the skin and not oily. * I was very excited to try out this product bc of hearing great things and hoping that it would help lighten hyperpigmentation that I have on my face but after using it for a few months it did absolutely nothing. Its very light wieght and gives you a glow. Just disappointed. * I love the fresh scent and feel of this lotion. I look forward to using this each morning."
319,panoxyl,am oil control moisturizer with broad spectrum spf 30 mineral sunscreen,pimprod2041857,2615401," * Oil control is the best I've seen. I use this under my makeup paired with a primer and it leaves no white cast. My makeup always looks flawless ALL DAY when I use it this. I basically use the entire PanOxyl line to control any breakouts. * They gave me an EXPIRED PRODUCT?? So I ordered 10/14/25 and the expiration date just says 2025/10 likeee? Unbeknownst to me id been using expired product on my face. :((. It worked great at first then started irritating my skin horribly. Good product when its not expired omg. * Needed something that wouldn't feel heavy and still be able to help with excessive oil. Definitely works and budget friendly * I had high hopes for this, but was very disappointed. I am pretty pale and the white cast from this was so intense it was almost blue. Texture is also thick and sticky and all-around horrible. I have oily skin, and looked oilier than normal very early in the day. It also pilled up under my makeup throughout the day. I would give zero stars if I could. * Not for ppl with tan skin, definitely leaves a white cast which is hard to blend out, did just ok for my oiliness still had to use blotting sheets after a few hours but not as much, but i mean for the price it's decent. Careful not to apply too much otherwise it gets flaky?? Pea sized amount for the whole face is what you're aiming. * made me look like the walking dead the white cast was so bad. took about 15 -20 minutes to sink in my skin and did not sit well with my makeup. pilled throughout the day every time I wore it. you are probably thinking I used to much by this review but I use a pea size each on both my cheeks and forehead, and a pea sized amount total on my nose, chin and around my mouth. it's about . 25 of an ounce. * I never leave reviews but I was really disappointed in this product. It had a white cast, peeled off my skin, didnt help with oil control, and made me break out."
