4,drunk elephant,protini polypeptide firming moisturizer,pimprod2028061,2588434," * This is one of the creams that I like to use the most to have good hydration and care of my skin because it has peptides that help maintain natural moisture and protect my skin barrier, it does not contain aroma and the softness is irresistible, also the presentation is very practical to be able to mix with another serum or dye that I want to add, they mix well .

5,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial cream with squalane,pimprod2002804,2540233," * I use it as a night cream and my skin soaks it up better than other night creams. It might be too moist for daytime use, so I'd recommend buying the travel size first to see if it's for you, but I highly recommend it. * I have combination skin that is both dry, oily and sensitive in certain areas on my face. i'm so glad I made the purchase and tried it out. I use this product religiously and have seen so much improvement! * My dry skin loves this moisturizer, it also has great humectant ingredients. This moisturizer is amazing, it is my new forever purchase. * Although its a bit pricey, this is my holy grail moisturizer. Does the job and doesn't break me out whatsoever! * I was excited to try this despite the high price. I have combination skin- dry in the winter, but my forehead and cheeks can get oily. This product felt good going on, but my skin, especially my cheeks, turned super red after use and stayed that way all day. I decided to stick with it for a couple days to see if my skin adjusted. Within a couple days of once daily use I had bad breakouts, as well. I'm 41 and typically have clear skin. This also made my forehead extremely greasy feeling, even if I only used a small amount there. I'm going to return it, even though I like the eye cream that came with it as a free gift. * Feels nice & hydrates my mature skin. Works well under makeup. * I have the most sensitive skin and have tried brands from, the outset, first aide beauty, tatcha , inn beauty , sunday riley, etc etc. they all break me out but not this stuff .

7,tula,24-7 weightless moisture day & night gel cream,pimprod2045112,2624255," * I bought this by accident when I was trying to buy the 24-7 day and night moistue. First thing  I noticed was the color, which made me realize I had bought the gel cream. The weightless texure is nice but the smell is absolutely awful. I will not be using this product due to the smell. * I bought this when my previous moisturizer was about to run out. This was on sale and the reviews seemed overall positive. I've used it twice and it's going in the trash. It has a nice, lightweight feel on my skin but the smell is awful. I can't tell if it's supposed to be scented or if it's the smell of just the ingredients but it smells like it's gone bad. There are so many other moisturizers out there that work well, are half the price, and don't leave you smelling like something expired. * Absolutely love this! I never put lotion on my face and just started using this product and I get so many compliments now how nice I look and young. I am almost 45 but I don't look it. * My beauty consultant, Beautifull (yes! that is her name) is the best in the business! I had so many questions when I was looking for a skin routine. I must say my skin is WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. She is located in North Texas! * I stopped buying moisture surge (and clinique in general) earlier this year, and searched for a comparable moisturizer all of 2024. Out of the 15 products I tried this year, this has been the best option by far. I honestly think this gel moisturizer is even better than Clinique's because it's fragrance free and 100% cruelty free. So many moisturizers are also too heavy for my sensitive and acne prone skin, but this is so lightweight and absorbs quickly. It's definitely worth the price, and a little goes a long way. * This is so light and so hydrating, it does not leave any sticky residue on the skin and no harsh smell. It cools the face and gives it a nice glow * I'm in my mid 40s, with sensitive combination skin, and this gel cream has been absolutely fantastic!  My previous moisturizer was a bit too heavy, and this one is just right for day and night use!!!"
8,it cosmetics,confidence in a cream anti-aging hydrating moisturizer,pimprod2033684,2598796," * Purchased this for my 23 year old daughter and this is the first moisturizer that doesn't irritate her highly sensitive skin. She approves. I haven't tried it myself though. It is a bit pricey though. * IT used to have a moisturizer I loved.  I didn't see it on the shelf so I bought this one instead based on the previous experience.  It's awful.  It doesn't hydrate all day and when I put it on in the morning and try to put foundation on, it's like...weird and sticky and I have a hard time blending in my foundation.  I tried 3 different foundations, so that is not the problem.  Never buying their products again. * I have been using this moisturizer for years and absolutely Love it!! 
I use to use the nighttime one as well but switched to using this morning & night because it works so well and feels so good on my skin.. * Feels heavy on skin, almost sticky and immediately broke out after using extremely unfortunate because I was really hoping this was going to be great! * Didn't really see a difference, just using it on my chest now * I have been using this moisturizer for a while and it consistently makes my skin feel fantastic and helps any signs of aging. * This leaves my face moist without that oily feeling."

I would recommend this product to all my friends and continue to buy again and again. * I have sensitive skin and have been using this moisturizer for a while now.

I'm a fan of pretty much everything The Ordinary and love how my skin has looked and felt. * My favorite moisterizer is the CeraVe one but i wanted to try a new one! This moisterizer is sooo good and works for me! This product is nice and lightweight which means that you can add as much product that you want! It doesn't break me out and has a lightweight feeling! * Had a breakout from this * I thought it was the intention of keeping my skin moisturized, but it does not feel moisturizing at all. It feels drying.

I only applied to my nose and chin as some reviews mentioned it broke them out. I noticed a few clogged pores but nothing that would detract from this product. You only need to use a tiny amount and this product is so moisturizing! I recommend to anyone witn stubborn blackheads! * I apply this at night before I go to sleep and my hands have never felt softer. While it is a thick product, it absorbs nicely and doesn't leave behind a greasy feeling. Love love love this product and highly recommend! * It broke my face out, but it's really nice for hands when you live in a cold place where it gets in the negatives * Vermont takes a toll on face, arms, hands each winter. Getting in the wood, shoveling the snow, usually during wind and cold, your face and hands takes a beating. I got a chemical peel and the dermatologist recommended this product. It was soothing, absorbed quickly into the skin, and brought relief from itching and irritated skin. I now use it on my arms and hands to help with that pesky thinning skin. * I'm a bit confused as some of the reviews talk about this breaking them out. I've not used it on my face. Only on my hands and absolutely LOVE it. It is pricey but I snatched some when it was on sale. So worth it during the really cold and dry winter months."

The ingredients leave my skin healthy and it creates the perfect foundation for makeup. gifted by dermalogica * This has great benefits, I love that it has SPF50 and it gives me a wonderful glow after. However, this breaks me out every time I use it. I've had this product for months and I didn't know for sure if it was from this product since I noticed I didn't have any the beginning of me using it. I decided to stop using it and my face was getting better. 
I'm so sad because this is not a cheap brand and this was definitely on the pricer side. I love their stabilizing repair cream super great. But I'll have to give this to a family member to see if it works better for them. * this is by far the best spf cream I've found. im 39 and i have dry skin. this product helps me get nice smooth skin.

28,cosrx,advanced snail 92 all in one cream,pimprod2038492,2610464," * this is one of my favorite korean skincare products ever, i have used it for about six years now. it keeps my skin feeling fresh and hydrated, and helps prevent signs of aging. if you don't like sticky or slimy things, maybe don't order a snail mucin moisturizer? i'm confused as to why you would lol. that's the whole point! it works very effectively and mixes well with my COSRX overnight rice leave-on mask. it is pricey but a little goes a long way, and the bottle lasts a couple of months. it is not meant to be worn under makeup though, it causes pilling and patchiness. * I liked this at first. I got the travel size to try it at first and a little does go along way. I've had it for a little over 2 months now and I don't think I've made a dent in it. And just for background I'm a highschooler with dry, eczema prone skin.

But no matter what I try my skin always peels after I put it on?? I do have dry, sensitive, eczema prone skin so I do wonder if its better for oily skin. Its just not enough for my dry skin and makes my skin peel and flake no matter how many times i change my other skincare products or makeup products. It mainly peels around my forehead, chin, and nose. Other than that I don't think it did anything for my skin that would justify the price. 

I wouldn'f repurchase personally. Maybe if I had oily skin?? * This lotion and the face wash in my everyday routine must have loved this will never change * I have sensitive skin this product cleans my face does not give me any irritation or itchiness after lose my Faith feeling refreshed and smooth. I'm always skeptical on using products to wash my face because it irritates my skin, but this is amazing. * Another great COSRX product. Moisturizes well. Can use anytime of the day. Can be use alone or with other products like the COSRX peptide skin booster. * I've been using it daily it keeps my face moisturized and isn't sticky/tacky and makes my skin look great * Lightweight , gel type moisturizer with that slightiy sticky feel you get with snail products. 
Perfect for under makeup as a skin prep/primer . 
Excellent for a daytime moisturizer or noght as well if you are oily . I prefer a heavier nighttime moisturizer as i am dry . 
I have very sensitive skin and am prone to rashes if there is any fragrance , essential oils or other harsh ingredients.  Ive never had an issue with any cosrx product."

I also make sure the moisturizer is fully dry before putting makeup and have absolutely no issues at all. It doesn't leave a film for me like I've seen in some of the other reviews and to be honest with the way it soaks in so smoothly on my skin I just don't see how it's possible. Everyone's skin is different though! * I hate not wearing foundation because my skin becomes grossly oily in a few hours. But this makes my skin look non-oily and matte with little effort. My skin doesn't feel dry, either! Would highly recommend this to anyone whose skin is oily and needs the hydration. * got this to try out and I love it! I definitely see improvement in my acne. * I love how this feels * My skin has not been reacting well to my previous moisturizers.  This one has FINALLY given me the protection and feel that I've been looking for. * This product soothing for my sensitive skin on face. It also helps control acne breakouts. * This moisturizer has helped me so much wotj my acne. I didnt have a set moisturizer and once i start using this one for 4 months i noticed the difference in my scars and skin. I pair this moisturizer with astrigent before to help with scarring as well and it works magic. If you are thinking about it or have trouble witj your acne like myself, i would recommend this."

It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy! * I can't believe it took me so long to find this amazing product. I will have it a part of my skin routine forever now! Such a great lotion for my whole body. Highly recommend purchasing if you have dry and sensitive skin. Game changing product so excited I found it! * As someone with dry and flaky skin, I've tried countless lotions over the years, but none have worked as effectively as this one.

The lotion has a rich, creamy texture that absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. My skin feels immediately hydrated and smooth after applying it."

It is not greasy at all and my makeup goes on top of it perfectly. * This moisturizer works good for me. I am extremely oily and it's more like a lotion and it leaves my skin soft and supple and it brightens my skin which is dull. * I've only been using this product for about a week and bought thr travel size to try it out, but I can tell already my skin has never felt and looked better! For about over a year I have been struggling with my face (ezcema, acene, other dry spots, discoloration) and Cerave products were my holy grail, until it wasn't, since then I have tried numerous products, spent $$$$ and nothing work. For the last 3-4months I have been using La Roche Posay face wash & face moisturizer and its been blah. I have only been using it bc i refused to try something else and spend more money. Finally, my sister suggested Dermalogica and OMG!! All this time I had been suffering. I bought the travel size to test it out bc the full size are pricey, but let me tell you, I don't care they are expensive anymore. I have already purchased the full size products and have a full regimen for my facs. Like I said, 

I've only been using the face mositurizer, face wash, the blue bottle exfoliter (twice a week), and the brightening kit (only at night) (all travel size) and my face looks & feels amazing. 

These are expensive products, but theres a spanish saying ""lo bueno cuesta"", in english ""the good things cost"" and with these products, I can agree. Also, a little bit really goes a long way. For the face wash, I only use a pea size and its really more than enough and prettu much same off all other products. * It moisturized my face so good. Unfortunately, i cant stand the bad smell…its so bad! * I am 48 and have been bouncing around forever trying to find the perfect cream for my combination skin.  A little goes a long way.  No greasy residue and moisturizes my dry spots all day long.  My skin is smooth and fine lines are completely blurred after a few weeks of use. Best cream out there for my skin. * I enjoy the smell it reminds me of baby lotion. My skin has never looked so hydrated until this product. I don't think I will ever try after moisturizer. * ."

Also the back of my hands. * This product makes my skin so soft, so supple and hydrated! Highly highly recommend. A little pricey but so worth it! * These product smells like natural skin care. I did not check the ingredients, though. It feels rich and luxurious. You do not need a lot to cover your entire face which helps with the price tag. I think it's nice & moisturizing! It pairs beautifully with the corresponding serum. * This cream is fantastic in plumping fine lines and wrinkles. Foundation goes on smooth. Skin is Hydrated all day. Great price and the jar lasts me 4-5 months. I highly recommend * I'm on my second jar of  the Magic Cream Moisturizer.  I like it! I use the oil on top.  I can't necessarily say that it has changed my skin but, I've been blessed with pretty good skin to begin with.  I do like the moisture it gives. * I love the way it works and the scent is very nice! I can't wait to try some of the other products in this line!

It would be even better if Ulta would send me a usable coupon once in a while, instead of spam coupons that do nothing except to clog up my email inbox!

I'm 71 and have no wrinkles  - just some sagging.   This cream smells great and it's  special ingredients tightens the skin and makes it glow.  The texture is a marvelous gel cream and it glides onto the skin.  ULTA occasionally has it at 1/2 price! * I really wanted to like this bc I LOVE Estee. But this did nothing for my skin. I even used the serum underneath. Clarins serum is what works * I love the way it goes on and how it feels on my face. It softens my skin and helps with my dry skin. * I have never used a more luxurious moisturizer. I got it as a sample and I had to run to buy the full size. It makes me look so youthful and my fine lines are GONE! I notice a massive difference in my appearance when I use this(only at night). I also use the advanced night repair serum which pairs well together. I have very sensitive combo skin. I'm super dry during the winter and oily diring the summer. Adding this to my skincare routine has completely transformed my skin. BUY IT! You will not regret it at all.

The long straw-like portion of the inner pump always comes broken off/detached! So there is nothing that allows the lotion to be pumped up and out. I can't go fishing around for it in the lotion, even with tweezers, unless I want to dump all the lotion out into something to even look for the detached portion of the pump mechanism! Soooo frustrating! * My fav moisturizer as someone with oily skin living in a hot climate. Have purchased many times, and will purchase again!! * the reason im giving it a 4.0 star is because it rans through quickly, i do enjoy this cream a lot during the summer but dueing the winter i dont. i am more on the dry side though. * I ran out of this moisturizer so fast. when I realized that it stopped pumping I decided to rip it open and use a pliers to push the rest of the product out and literally there is a mountain of it that came out."

I saw another reviewer say they fixed the issue and I followed what they did. I massaged the tube for about 5 minutes and soaked it in a bowl of warm water for 3 minutes after you MUST shake the tube vigorously until you stop hearing the water in the tube and it'll be good to go!   It is very hydrating and calms my skin when itchy or dry. * I have very dry mature skin.  My skin needs a lot of hydration.  I also have flaking after using retinol.  I apply this to my skin at night to seal in my other products.   I also put a small amount under my eyes.  I have had no irritation.  You do have to shake the tube and massage it to get the product to to absorb the liquid that is in the tube.  It's like a bi-facil product. * Hydrates well, i found a solution to the seperation issue!! All you need to do is massage it with a closed cap for 2-4 minutes then put it in some hot water for 4 minutes and then shake it!! It becomes all mixed together just as new * First time ordering but from other reviews seems abnormal that the product is watery and separated. Even tried shaking it each time before using and still a ton of water comes out before any other product. Not sure how well it works since stopped using because of this. * I bought this moisturizer to help my dry winter skin and it did do that! It relieved the tight feeling on my face and made my skin feel/look glowy in the morning. However, it was a very greasy feeling product and I would only use it at night. Like a lot of other people, mine was very watery when I first got it. That was a bit frustrating because it was super messy. I still used the watery part and I think the effect was the same though. Once I used it for a week or so, it came out as a cream. Overall, I enjoyed it but hoping to find less greasy alternatives. * Shocked at how well this worked. I purchased because i heard some reccomend it to use under lip balm before bed as ""lip slugging"". I used it for that initialky and someone got around the outside of lip area and the next morning i saw the biggest decrease in perioral dermatitis (mine is caused by steroid inhaler use for asthma i have to take 2x daily) i ever have had. Now ive been using it nightly in those areas and my skin there is as clear as its ever been. Been a while that ive been this impressed with a skincare product. * I absolutely loved this product and have used up multiples of these.

While it has a nice texture and the ingredients look fabulous, this cream resulted in the worst allergic reaction I've ever experienced. After two uses, my skin was visibly red, tingly, textured, and incredibly itchy. Unfortunately think this damaged my barrier as my skin is still recovering using other tried and tested products. If you have sensitive skin, I'd skip. * Oh how I wanted to love this. The ingredient list looks nice, and I'd heard good reviews, but unfortunately this cream just did not work out for me. I have no idea what's causing it, but this moisturizer somewhat burns my skin every time I apply it. It also seems to be making my facial eczema worse. The texture is different, more of a whipped consistency, but still hydrating. I feel like my skin might need more moisture though. It's also expensive for what it is. Unfortunately it's too late for me to return it, and since it was pricey I'm going to use it up anyways, but I would not repurchase. Honestly you can find many just as good-if not better face creams out there with similar ingredients, that cost much less. * Made skin dry and itchy, not moisturizing. * I use this over the mad hippie super A serum, at night before I go to work. And I love this product. I don't use it twice a day but you probably could if you wanted to. This also feels like a rich moisturizer after I use the mad hippie enzyme scrub, it just makes my skin feel wonderful. I have acne prone skin and also wanted something good for anti aging, since 30 was approaching. * I wanted to love this product. I wanted a night cream with collagen & this has mostly good reviews.

I only need to blot once a day at work instead of three! * I have used FAB products before. Always liked their daily moisturizer but i have oily skin so it didn't help, but this oil control moisturizer helps a lot. My skin doesn't look as shiny. Perfect product for summer. It is not heavy at all. * In my search for an oil-free moisturizer this was recommended. I used this for a month and loved it. No breakouts, controlled my oily skin and seemed to work really well. So, I stocked up and got more. I noticed something was different after the 3rd use of the new jar. I started breaking out. I haven't broken out in almost 3 years. I was confused and continued to use it because why would it start breaking me out now? I loved the first jar. I'm not sure if the formula changed or if my skin is just being finicky. 

Overall, I recommend the product because it seems to be very good. It's a struggle for us oily girls to find products that offer us a balance of hydration while keeping oil at bay. I hope it works for you if you try it :) * Ever since Neutrogena discontinued their Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin - my holy grail of moisturizers - I have been desperately searching for a replacement that will keep my breakouts under control without over-drying my skin. The search is finally over - this is it!! My skin starting clearing up and looking healthier after the first overnight application! I've now been using it for 2 months and it's continued to significantly reduce my breakouts (in frequency and duration) without drying out my skin. The only downside is that the container is about half the size I was assuming it would be, based on other FAB products I've purchased. (Although that's on me for not looking at the size printed on the front of the product.) Each container lasts me a little over 2 months with one application per day on my face and sometimes neck and/or chest. Honestly though I'm in love. * Ive used this product for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin and have used several different face moisturizers over the years and this is the only one that keeps my face from getting super shiny by the end of the day, even with serums underneath it. It WORKS so to me its worth every penny! * This is the best moisturizer I have ever found for my oily skin! I have an oily t-zone and this keeps my skin from becoming oily all day. I worked an 8-hour shift wearing this and when I got home my forehead was still dry, but not peeling, it just felt finally normal. I use this on my entire face, but keep in mind you can use it only in certain areas that you struggle with oil, so don't let other reviews about dry skin deter you. With winter coming up I may begin to only use this on my oily areas and another moisturizer on others, but this is literally the holy grail moisturizer for anyone struggling with oily skin. * I have combination skin and this has saved my skin texture and made it so soft. The consistency feels so nice and it's not overly drying even in my dry areas. Feel like it's reduced some redness as well."

No allergic reaction or anything, and the sensation goes away, but I don't feel comfortable using it on my face anymore. The skin on your body is tougher and I don't get any burning sensation when using it on my body so I think I will use it as a body cream now. It is pretty thick too. 
I've noticed some people love this moisturizer and some experience sensitivities so it really does depends on your skin. It's important to PATCH TEST! * Im not sure why but when it arrived it was completely separated. Its just liquid that comes out when i push down on the bottle. For this price point, that shouldnt be happening. Disappointing! * Had high hopes for this, but, the packaging is awful and burns my face with practically zero hydration. When I press the top water comes out and it's impossible to mix up the product. Maybe it wouldn't be so irritating on my face if mixed properly. * My favorite moisturizer! * I genuinely wanted to love this moisturizer because when it was mixed well, my skin felt so great & my makeup looked THAT much better. 
But… most of the time i got the water out of the bottle or the moisturizer with no water and it didnt spread as well or even fell as soft on my skin. * This is my all-time favorite moisturizer! Fragrance and alcohol free, the goat milk softens my skin and the niacinamide perfectly addresses any texture concerns. I love that the gentle formula is still effective and the cloud-like moisture packs on all day hydration from just one pump.

48,beautycounter,countercontrol matte effect gel cream,pimprod2038172,2606559," * If you truly have oily skin, you know the difference in a review from someone with oily skin vs someone whos skin gets oily.  I have oily skin and probably spend upwards of $1K a year on products trying to find things that actually do as they claim, and this is one of them.

I was a little reluctant to purchase this as the price is pretty high for a brand I've never used, but I'm glad that I took the risk on it.  Prior to this moisturizer I was either using none at all (because most others just make me more oily, dont need redundant products on oily skin), or I was using the La-Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Matte one which didn't do much for me. Obviously how this will work for you is going to be different for everyone, and the other products you use prior to your moisturizer will make a difference as well.

For reference I am a 28 yr old female, white/Caucasian.  My morning routine is: wash with a clay based cleanser (Dermalogica), tone (Fenty Skin), hyperpigmentation serum (Good Molecules), niacinamide/zinc serum (Sunday Riley), then this moisturizer. The consistency of this product is great for oil as it is a gel based product, but it comes out more opaque white than clear which is fine. It does not have much of a fragrance that I have noticed, but I'm not sensitive to fragrance so I wouldn't be one to say. When I put this on it almost feels as if it is a crossover between a moisturizer and a makeup primer that blurs your pores.  Now it does not make your pores go away by any means, but it does HELP.  Immediately after applying my skin is definitely mattified but again, not completely shine free as if it is a primer with the sole purpose of making your skin look like it has powder on it. It does not make my skin feel tight and dried out, it genuinely makes me feel moisturized and smooth without the glowy look that normal moisturizers do. From my experience it definitely does not keep me matte for 8 hours, I would say after about 3-4 hours I start to see shine on my face to the point where I feel the need to blot if I were going out somewhere (this is all without wearing makeup or anything on top of my morning skin routine, I work from home).

If you truly have an oily/combo skin type this is not going to be your holy-grail product that makes all of your problems disappear (will continue to search for it), but if it is within your budget for a product of this type then this is 100% top 5 best moisturizers for oily skin on the market right now in my opinion after having used this for a few weeks now.  Would repurchase (and I rarely ever find products I do)!  

I also just want to throw out there that I did buy this on my own, was not asked/paid to write this, and I think this is either my only review I've ever written on Ulta or one of a few over a span of years that I don't even remember. * The packaging is very luxe but the pump feels like its empty and its still half full. It doesn't mattify anything but it is a nice mix of a gel and lotion and a lightweight moisturizer. This is an MLM and I do feel it's overpriced for what it is. It's pretty basic. * Matte effect that works great as a moisturizer/ primer for oily skin types"

Always  feels good and moisturizing, without feeling or looking greasy!🥰 * Overrall this moisturizer is good and I would recommend for someone with oily skin, but it just does the bare minimum for skincare. Probably wont repurchase unless looking for something lightweight. * I absolutely love this moisturizer!  It's super lightweight yet provides just the right amount of hydration to keep my skin feeling soft and smooth all day. It absorbs quickly, doesn't feel greasy, and layers beautifully under sunscreen and makeup.

I have combination skin, and this moisturizer balances it perfectly—hydrating the dry areas without making my T-zone oily. Plus, I love that it has simple, skin-friendly ingredients with no unnecessary fragrances or irritants.

For the price, this is an amazing staple in my routine. If you're looking for an affordable, lightweight moisturizer that actually works, this is it! * I love this moisturizer i mix it with the Hyaluronic acid from the brand. * I have oily/combo skin & I really like this moosturizer a lot! It's super lightweight, but doesn't leave my skin dry after using just a pea sized amount. It moisturizes so well enough to leave my skin feeling so soft, supple, and glowy! It doesn't completely reduce oil production at least in my oily t zone area, but it still leaves it soft & smooth. Using this along with niacinamide definitely helps improve my skin's texture. I would for sure recommend this to anyone needing a lightweight yet hydrating moisturizer! * I'm always a bit skeptical of new moisturizers, but I can say that I'm thoroughly impressed and surprised. The name does not lead you astray and it is the perfect lightweight moisturizer, great throughout the whole year. Its small size makes it perfect to put into a backpack or just take on the go! * I bought this and was excited to try this product out, since i have oily skin i saw the word lightweight and was like ""heck yeah"". Well, it turns out if i use anything larger than a pea size amount its so hard to rub in. And when i do use just a pea sized amount my skin feels dry.

I only use this as part of my night routine."

At first I was using too much and it pilled on me. Using the proper amount gives all dsy hydration. * I am a devout Chanel Sublimage fan but wanted to try a ""clean"" line. This product listed shea as an ingredient as does the aforementioned. Well, my skin hasn't been clearer, pores smaller, literally no makeup other than a mineral spf. I'm stunned with the results in two weeks. Please try this if you have combo or dryish skin...young or mature. * I use IT face cream and love it but wanted to more moisture in my skin.  this product is amazing and I am so glad I found it.  Makes my skin feel so soft.  Love it!! * This moisturizer is moisturizing, however there are better, less expensive great ones out there.  I have used it for about a month and I do not notice anything amazing that would justify the price or a repurchase. * I cannot use this brands skincare and makeup products. I am very allergic to the products * Absolutely HATE this cream. Made my skin break out in tiny pimples that I am having a hard time getting rid of.

I found myself going back to this one (aqua bomb), and it is amazing. It doesn't break you out, it soothes well, stays on your face all day, and doesn't grease you up. This is by far the BEST moisturizer I've used by far. I have recommended it to friends and they love it. I have a combination skin type, but within each season it feels different, but still, this is magic on your skin * I went through 2 jars of this and loved the way my skin looked and felt.  Third time was a disaster.  My face is breaking out in hard bright red patches and is burning starting with the first use of latest jar. So bummed, can't use or recommend after loving so much. * I love this moisturizer so much.  It's light and feels so soft on my face after applying, almost like powder.  The scent is so nice too. * I was given a small size to try, its incredible. Will definitely purchase!!! * Got a free sample of this (foil packet) and really liked it. Bought it on a 5x points sale (love those). Am enjoying it. I have seen a lot less dryness in my skin since I started using this. I have combo skin...T zone oil but dry around mouth corners and centers of cheeks. I'm in my early 50s. * I really like this moisturizer. I tried it for the first time and it absorbs quickly but is moisturizing gor my combo skin. * Tried a smaple out of this a few months ago and LOVED IT, was soooo excited to buy the full size. Found out after buying that they changed the formula, about a week into use my skin was ruined. Texture worse than ive ever had before. Gave me black heads, cystic acne. My skin was red irriated, and DRY. Super disappointing and returned."

But I am utterly disappointed. It caused severe eye irritation that i had to go see an ophthalmologist. No sunscreen has caused me such reaction so i was worreid. However i do think it's a good moistirozer with SPF but its just not for me. * This moisturizer initially feels amazing on the skin, and it worked well under my makeup. However, after a few hours, my eyes began to burn and sting! It happened on 2 separate days so i know that it is this moisturizer. Again, i really wanted to like this but it really irritates my eyes. * This is a really great SPF moisturizer. It really holds up to its name. I've been looking at this brand for months and finally got it. I've only been using this for a little under a week but this by far, has been the best SPF moisturizer I've EVER used. Someone who works at Ulta said this was a really great product; she was correct. What sold me is when she said it holds up really well for people who have oily skin, which is an issue for me so I have an issue with products that make my skin extra oily. This is very lightweight and worth the money. I just need to see how this holds up with this FL heat. * I thought this was the perfrct match for me as i am lazy and hate having to layer moisturizer with an SPF and get greasy quick. This dries down matte at first but within an hour or so is super greasy and makes my face very shiny. For the price I expected better. * I tend to find most sunscreens to be greasy, oily, or sticky even when they claim otherwise. I assumed this would be the same especially since its a sunscreen moisturizer combo. However I was wrong!  The texture and finish is so so lovely. It's very lightweight and glides on nicely, moisturizes without leaving me feeling like a shiny greasy mess! It's perfect under make too. Highly recommend! * It is weightless but it burns yours eyes terribly when you go to take it off ...and it's not sweat proof...for the almost $50 this is I expect more out of a spf moisturizer. There are drugstore brands that can offer the same for a way less price point. Definitely returning."

I know the reviews aren't good but; I had a  free sample of the face wash first, so I knew i would like it. I would say this if u don't like scented or oil on ur face, then pass on this. I love alot of moisturizer on my face so it doesn't bother me at all! Also I have eczema and it doesn't break me out although it's scented 😳 I love it! Love it! * Sometimes when I buy kits, I'll use most of them (but not all of them). With this kit, I use every single one of the products in here and I LOVE them! * I am SO VERY HAPPY I was able to purchase this set for my BIRTHDAY MONTH!!!!!  I am officially 51 years old.  My skin is incredibly HAPPY!!!!!  I have used TULA products for the past 6 years and when i saw this particular set on sale during the 21 days of beauty I HAD TO BUY IT!!!!!!!!  PLUS i was able to use my 20% off AND my ULTA REWARDS!!!!!!  So i got this for a STEAL!!!!!  OK so NO More bragging about me.  TULA has some of the ABSOLUTE BEST ANTI AGING AND SPECIFIC ROUTINE ADDRESSING PRODUCTS!!!!!!   I have had issues with drying skin around my mouth (upper area to chin).  And i have used everything under the sun!  However when i got to use the TULA 24/7 cream:  I WAS INCREDIBLY HAPPY!!!!!!!!!  Finally my skin is HYDRATED AND FEELING WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!  And I not oily on my forehead or nose!!!!!!!!!!  Love, LOVE TULA PRODUCTS!!!!!!!!!! * This product made my oily face feel even greasier. * I did not like any product in this bundle. The facial cleanser doesn't get makeup off well. The moisturizer left my skin greasy, The brightening undereye stick didn't do anything but make my concealer go on wrong. * I love tula and a lot of there products however, definitely try one of there products before getting this bundle! I have sensitive skin and rosacea, i tried there firming moisturizer first before i bought this to see if i would have a reaction to tula products
The bundle is definitely a great deal and so far i have no issues or no break outs, its been a week! * Tula has helped my skin so much! I was scared to use it at first because my skin is so sensitive! But since ive been using i dont get big painful breakouts anymore! My skin is clear, soft, and glowing! I also used to have the little sweat bumps on my face, completely gone since using this! It did take about two weeks to see the results! So if you wait youll see the difference!

This is it! Love the clean ingredients and that it doesnt have much of a smell. My husband has even started using it, and that is saying something. * I have tried so many moisturizers. I have sensitive skin and I am also very careful with certain ingredients I use on my skin. This is the best moisturizer, it's hydrating but not greasy and great for day or night. I just mix it with my sunscreen in the morning. * I wanted to love this moisturizer because its clean- I didn't even mind the smell even though some complain about it. But I noticed after several weeks of use, I had many blackheads on my nose and chin. I didn't realize it wasn't non-comedogenic so that was on me for not paying attention. If you have acne or get breakouts, I wouldn't recommend this. * I wish the people who get the products for FREE other wise known as influencers would just be honest. I found it no big deal I've used other products for alot less money, but the 5 ⭐ crews won't be getting free stuff if they don't give a high score. Wait a few weeks to buy it and if you don't like return it, so this is an HONEST review. * Love it!! * I highly recommend this! I kept finding moisturizers that either broke me out or pilled on my face (deal breaker). This one does neither and keeps my face moisturized. It is on the pricey side, but I bought it on sale. The only thing I don't love is the smell. At first it just smells like nothing, but once I rub it in it's almost a chemical smell? Not sure, but I'll take that over not breaking me out. * It goes on like silk and makes your face feel soft and smooth. Feels good after I put on my toner and serums and then it's like a nice after finish. Good smell. Overall the best moisturizer I've used. Somewhere between a gel and a cream"

Lays beautifully under makeup too. * I was looking for something very hydrating to use as a night time moisturizer for my dry skin. This moisturizer smells great (a light fresh citrusy scent) and melts into the skin nicely but it is light enough that I could use it as a daytime moisturizer, and it's probably not even moisturizing enough for that. My skin has been dry and flaky since I have switched to this. Maybe ok for oily skin, but not hydrating enough for dry skin. * Love it goes on smooth.. not sticky. Light weight and very moisturizing. * I've never left a skin product review, but I feel compelled. I've been using this close to a year, and if I run out it is definitely noticeable! This keeps me moisturized (I have dry skin) and skin feels more plump. I can finally stop the never ending hunt. * Great purchase! * I like this product and I would remind it to anyone who ask me what do you use for your face and I would tell why it it works for me. * In loveeee! As soon as I got this onto my dry hands. The crème absorbs so nicely into my skin. The scent is light and fresh. The packaging is pretty end simple.

I was really impressed with this product given the cost. I was thinking it would be too light for winter, but i was happy to discover that it has a nice thick consistency and long lasting coverage. It's hydrating 12+ hours for me, even though it's during a dry winter. * Love this product! It's so light weight and refreshing * I loved this moisturizer! The problem with it is that it is very watery and pretty much slips off my finger when I try applying it * this moisturizer has a watery, milky, serum-like consistency. it goes on easily and absorbs quickly. it does help control oil and minimize the appearance of pores. it also seems to improve texture a bit. however, it burns and stings like crazy for a few minutes after initial application, and leaves skin quite red. (i do not have sensitive skin/allergies). the redness and irritation goes away shortly, but i can't say this unenjoyable experience is worth the potential benefits, considering the moisturization is very poor. i feel a more hydrating moisturizer is necessary to use on top of this one. in summary, a bit irritating and not very hydrating, would not recommend for sensitive or dry skin. * This moisturizer has a serum- like texture and SLAYS! Ive wanted this since FOREVER! * This moisturizer has a serum- like texture and SLAYS! Ive wanted this since FOREVER! * Absolutely a awesome product! It doesn't make my skin too oily or not have enough moisture. It is right in the middle perfectly! It has a fluffy texture which makes it seem very expensive. The packing is very cute.

Currently using tret .025% and a compound of azaelic/spirono/nicotinamide for hormonal acne, and this repair cream keeps my skin from drying out into a red crusty flake.

And I can honestly say.. this product rocks!! Absolutely love the convenience of the travel size, it packs a punch and smells great too! * I have dry skin and since I started using Dermalogica stabilizing repair cream I had breakouts on the chin area that I usually don't have. Lots of little pimples so I'm guessing this moisturizer doesn't work well ok dry/sensitive skin. I can feel the hydration it leaves on the skin but it doesn't work for me. Gifted by dermalogica to give my honest opinion * Gifted by Dermalogica for review purposes.
This cream is so calming and soothing. I was surprised by how amazing it felt the first time I applied it. The texture is on the thicker side, but it feels nourishing on my skin, not heavy at all. I have eczema and rosacea and the Stabilizing Repair Cream is now at the top of my list. I am able to use it in my day and night routines and it fits right in. 
I also love that it has the Seal of Acceptance from the National Eczema Association. I trust products with the seal as they are always great for my skin. * This Dermalogica Stabilizing Repair Cream is REALLY great! I love the texture, it's nice and thick, and it's perfect for the winter and at night! I wish I'd gotten a full size, because I love it! It's one of the best creams I've tried in a long time, and that's saying a lot, because I try new creams all the time! I'll definitely be buying a full size!
Gifted by Dermalogica - opinions are my own. * ive heard good things about this brand so i definitely went in with high expectations. this cream is very thick but i feel like it feels a little too thick for my liking. this is definitely not for the oily skin girls. overall it was very underwhelming. gifted by dermalogica"

First thing  I noticed was the color, which made me realize I had bought the gel cream. The weightless texure is nice but the smell is absolutely awful. I will not be using this product due to the smell. * I bought this when my previous moisturizer was about to run out. This was on sale and the reviews seemed overall positive. I've used it twice and it's going in the trash. It has a nice, lightweight feel on my skin but the smell is awful. I can't tell if it's supposed to be scented or if it's the smell of just the ingredients but it smells like it's gone bad. There are so many other moisturizers out there that work well, are half the price, and don't leave you smelling like something expired. * Absolutely love this! I never put lotion on my face and just started using this product and I get so many compliments now how nice I look and young. I am almost 45 but I don't look it. * My beauty consultant, Beautifull (yes! that is her name) is the best in the business! I had so many questions when I was looking for a skin routine. I must say my skin is WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. She is located in North Texas! * I stopped buying moisture surge (and clinique in general) earlier this year, and searched for a comparable moisturizer all of 2024. Out of the 15 products I tried this year, this has been the best option by far. I honestly think this gel moisturizer is even better than Clinique's because it's fragrance free and 100% cruelty free. So many moisturizers are also too heavy for my sensitive and acne prone skin, but this is so lightweight and absorbs quickly. It's definitely worth the price, and a little goes a long way. * This is so light and so hydrating, it does not leave any sticky residue on the skin and no harsh smell. It cools the face and gives it a nice glow * I'm in my mid 40s, with sensitive combination skin, and this gel cream has been absolutely fantastic!  My previous moisturizer was a bit too heavy, and this one is just right for day and night use!!!"

I layer different skincare year round but this is my always moisturizer. * I've tried many moisturizers and serums to fix my skin barrier after I destroyed it doing a 10 step care routine. So far, this works to make my cheeks less red without giving me acne. It also lessened a wrinkle caused by an acne scar. * I originally bought this product when it was on sale. I liked it well enough, but it ended up taking a backseat to my other well-loved lotions and creams. Then I got pregnant and developed cystic acne on my chin that was painful, and I couldnt get it to go away.

Its great for sensitive skin that is prone to irritation. Any time I've had skin reactions on my face, this is the product I reach for to help with the itchiness and dryness. It's very hydrating (a bit thicker) while still working well with oily skin. I especially love using this in the colder and drier winter months. * I had high hopes for this product but it caused itching after applying.

I did try an actual retinol serum (from a different brand) when I had ran out of my 2nd tube thinking i was ready to move up to a higher percentage- i threw it away, it was so oily and it smelled so bad! I immediately returned to this cream! I do just wish higher percentages were available as i do still think i can do more than the 0.1% retinol thats in here. Until that happens though, i will always use this retinol cream! * I use strong retinols all the time and this gave me the worst rashes. The tube also sucks and profuct is wasted. I thought the smell was off. * This was my first time using retinol and i highly recommend especially for the price. My face was smoother after a couple uses. There are some reviews saying they had bad reactions, but don't forget that it is retinol! Everyones skin reaction is different. And for the price, it's really not bad compared to other prices. It's honestly worth a shot. * My skin was fairly clear before using the product and after using it for a few days, it has completely broke my face out.

My skin is so hydrated and looks beautiful in the morning! Also, if i develop a blemish during the day, I will still slap this moisturizer on top of it at night and not only does it not make it worse, it actually heals it and my skin clears up so much faster! Highly recommend this product. * This was recommended to me by the consultant and I love it."
79,good molecules,lightweight daily moisturizer,pimprod2023937,2582316," * I will be ordering this again and again! Always  feels good and moisturizing, without feeling or looking greasy!🥰 * Overrall this moisturizer is good and I would recommend for someone with oily skin, but it just does the bare minimum for skincare. Probably wont repurchase unless looking for something lightweight. * I absolutely love this moisturizer!  It's super lightweight yet provides just the right amount of hydration to keep my skin feeling soft and smooth all day. It absorbs quickly, doesn't feel greasy, and layers beautifully under sunscreen and makeup.

I have combination skin, and this moisturizer balances it perfectly—hydrating the dry areas without making my T-zone oily. Plus, I love that it has simple, skin-friendly ingredients with no unnecessary fragrances or irritants.

For the price, this is an amazing staple in my routine. If you're looking for an affordable, lightweight moisturizer that actually works, this is it! * I love this moisturizer i mix it with the Hyaluronic acid from the brand. * I have oily/combo skin & I really like this moosturizer a lot! It's super lightweight, but doesn't leave my skin dry after using just a pea sized amount. It moisturizes so well enough to leave my skin feeling so soft, supple, and glowy! It doesn't completely reduce oil production at least in my oily t zone area, but it still leaves it soft & smooth. Using this along with niacinamide definitely helps improve my skin's texture. I would for sure recommend this to anyone needing a lightweight yet hydrating moisturizer! * I'm always a bit skeptical of new moisturizers, but I can say that I'm thoroughly impressed and surprised. The name does not lead you astray and it is the perfect lightweight moisturizer, great throughout the whole year. Its small size makes it perfect to put into a backpack or just take on the go! * I bought this and was excited to try this product out, since i have oily skin i saw the word lightweight and was like ""heck yeah"". Well, it turns out if i use anything larger than a pea size amount its so hard to rub in. And when i do use just a pea sized amount my skin feels dry. Im keepinh it only as a back up but i can't say this is my favorite moisturizer."

You cannot beat the price. Would highly recommend. * During the winter I have ultra dry flaky skin. This stuff is a miracle!

I had stopped using it because I thought it was breaking me out (turns out it was another product) but went back to it when I did have a really bad breakout and it completely cleared it! * i feel like i barely need a primer, it's so good! hydrated and softened my skin so well * this is my favorite face moisturizer. it's decent price for a face moisturizer, and i've never noticed any issues after using it. it does it's job, and I love how lightweight it feels on my face. plus, it lasts so long for a small bottle. * I started using this product as my face tends to be oily and at the very beginning, it was working perfectly - not oily residues for sure. Issue is, after a while of daily use, my skin would feel dry; even patchy. Wouldn't wear underneath make-up, for sure. * I was using the glow watermelon and it was alright but my skin now is so soft and looks so healthy and it really glows without feeling greasy or making me look super oily"

I have used this cream for about a month and the fragrance is too much for me. I will continue to use it but wish there was a fragrance free version. * I have used this product for years, it clears my face leaves it smooth and young looking. I recommend this product * I bought the Lancome holiday gift pack with this included. Otherwise I don't think I would've ever bought it. Out of the entire set this is the one I use consistently because of the way it feels. Woke up today and forgot I used to have age spots. They're gone. * This has a strong perfume smell.  I bought it half off during days of beauty.  Reviews are good but that strong perfume smell.  might use it on chest instead of face to use up. * Ive tried a lot of face creams, this is definitely in my top 3. This cream is ideal for mornings where you want something moisturizing but not too oily. I can also see a difference in brighness and fine lines. I also feel like this cream works with most skin types. I have dry skin and it works well as a day cream. * About two months ago I received a super sample of this and I was SHOCKED at the difference in my skin within 48 hours. My fine lines were already fading and my skin was taught. At 46 years old I've tried every serum and moisturizer, including high end brands such as Sunday Riley and Drunk Elephant only to be left with little to no results and wasted money. This particular line of Lancome products is expensive and beyond my normal budget but it is worth every penny. I just started using the serum and these products have changed my life. I will always look for the best sales and discounts but if I would pay full price because this moisturizer is magic and now a permanent staple in my skincare routine and I HIGHLY recommend this for all women my age and up in need of help fighting fine lines and wrinkles and skin elasticity. * This product has improved the appearance of my skin without causing any breakouts. I love the texture and it has a pleasant smell to it"

The duo smells nice and feels jice going on. Howecer this juice was not worth the squeeze and the dispenser clogged easily and often. * I went to buy a product that was highly recommended. The store associate introduced me to the Juice line, and it is the first product line that I honestly felt almost instantaneous results. * I started with the samples and i was really hoping I would hate it since it is so expensive. Unfortunately I loved it, and now I'm forced to spend a fortune on skincare. Use with their vitamin c, primer, foundation and translucent powder and your aging face will thank you, but your bank account won't. * I love juice beauty's products so I couldn't wait to try this product! I used it night cream the first night I got it and woke up and washed my face and placed on the day cream. Moments afterward my face began to feel very itchy and uncomfortable. If I would itch it would leave scratch welts all over my face (what it looks like when a dog jumps up and scratches you is the best way to describe it), followed by an itchy sensation from my head to my toes. Once I would itch I would get little hive bumps and the scratch welts all over my body. Very sad this product did not work out for me, but wanted to warn others that have sensitive skin. * This moisturizer is very thick and seems to be a great product with the exception of the smell. It is a vibrant apple/lemon like a candy. 
Reminds me of a teenage type product, unfortunately it is to potent to use at night, to try to fall asleep it just keeps me up."
84,fresh,rose deep hydration face cream,pimprod2025112,2584148," * Love the day and night cream * Huge fan of fresh products. Received in a sample and then bought the full size. Within 6 weeks my skin got so dry, tight, and inflamed. Acne sprung up. The skin especially around my chin / jaw / cheeks started cracking and scabbing. It smells and feels so nice but the end result over time was not good. Switched my moisturizer and immediately the cracking, inflammation, and acne went back to normal. 

Love Fresh but not this product. * They dont give that much product to see if it does anything and it clog my pours more * It works great. Its not greasy. It absorbs well, and my skin is soft. My sensitive skin is not adversly affected in any way. It's a good moisturizer, and it's light scent smells great. * I wanted to love this moisturizer because I've loved other products from Fresh and I love the scent, but it was very disappointing. I used it at night after my full routine, and noticed within about 30 minutes that my skin felt tight (not moisturized). It was like the product had dried into a layer sitting on top of my skin. The next morning my skin didnt feel well-hydrated at all, in fact I had dry patches in areas that would typically be fine with previous moisturizers I've used. Unfortunate for the high price point, but maybe it's just not for me. * I really really wanted to love this moisturizer because of the texture, fragrance and overall feeling when putting it on but the peeling is crazy! For the price this product should not be peeling off pf my face within 5 minutes of me putting it on. Love the texture + fragrance but hate the peeling. * I havd been using this for a while now and it pills like drazy after it dries down - which translates on the makeup since it comes off when you apply. I know its not my skin since i exfoliate - so it shouldn't be doing this. I'm disappointed."

Goes on easy, absorbs and doesn't leave a sunscreen residue. Leaves my face feeling soft and make up goes on easy after. Bonus for smelling good!!! Not a lot of product for the prices is the only downside. * My dermotologist  has not needed to treat as many pre-cancer spots on my face since using this product. * This product burned the skin under my eyes creating blisters.  I have never had this problem and I d not have sensitive skin. * I love this sunscreen because I have oily/sensitive/acne prone skin and this sunscreen works well with my skin.

Best of all, it does not burn my eyes!!  I apply it alone to my neck after serums and moisturizer but do mix with my foundation when I apply to my face. * I was given the sunscreen by my mom try, but after a few weeks of using it I notices it made my skin extremely dry. It also caused my make up to separate even when allowing 15 minutes to dry before applying foundation. I've increased my moisturizer usage hoping that would help offset the dryness, but it has not helped at all. This sunscreen has an odd smell to it. * I've had such a hard time finding a face sunscreen that didnt mess with my skin or makeup and this is it! I'm obsessed with how easy it is to apply after my skincare and it was no issue at all with my makeup after application! It doesn't have a typical sunscreen smell. I will say, for someone like myself who had oily combo skin, this might be a hit or miss for you, but for myself personally I didn't mind it at all :) * My sister-in-law got this and I've always wanted to try it and have it my own and I love it 😊 * Smells terrible and goes on like flaky paste. Overall gross feeling. Very dissatisfied. * I've tried countless sunblocks, most of which caused me breakouts and I usually hate the way they feel on my skin or smell. This one is my GOAT. It layers well over my other skincare and makes a great primer for makeup. I always repurchase this."

It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy! * I can't believe it took me so long to find this amazing product. I will have it a part of my skin routine forever now! Such a great lotion for my whole body. Highly recommend purchasing if you have dry and sensitive skin. Game changing product so excited I found it! * As someone with dry and flaky skin, I've tried countless lotions over the years, but none have worked as effectively as this one.

My skin felt so plump and hydrated, with slightly reduced redness. I'm saving up to put this amazing cream again. The texture is thick, but absorbed well. Love it a lot!! * This product is very thick and little bit goes a long way.  I have been using it consistently for a week and my skin feels so soft. My skin has the tendency to be very dry and flaky especially with it being so cold and windy.  My skin is loving the extra moisture it is getting. * Perfect addition to my night time skin care routine. So buttery and moisturizing. It is too thick for me to use during the daytime under my makeup, but I just use the original tula for that :) * This is an excellent moisturizer for dry and irritated skin!I use it nightly after my prescription acne treatments and it really helps keep my skin hydrated and is very soothing. * I got this as a sampler and used it for about a week.  Everytime i put it on, it burned my face. I thought maybe it was one of the other serums i had on that was having a reaction to, but slowly began to realize it was this moisturizer. I am not experiencing a rash in my eye areas and cheeks. * I have combination, sensitive skin. I generally use a light weight moisturizer daily after showering and sometimes at night when I actually bother to wash my face. It's always worked great but I was experiencing a little bit of dryness so I decided to try this. It didn't irritate my skin at any point but it also didn't moisturize my skin. Trying to wear makeup only magnifies the dryness/flaking (and it's a hydrating CC cream). * I like to wear this at night. I put it on as the last step to my routine at night. It locks everything in beautifully and my skin feels nice and soft in the morning.

I've never tried it on under makeup as I light lighter creams under makeup."

I love how moisturized it leaves my skin & i love how i can go out with out any makeup and my skin looks so GREAT. It's seriously worth it. * I bought this as I was searching for an affordable dupe of the Tatcha moisturing cream. This is really close to it as it is hydrating, leaves your skin feeling and looking supple, and decent price point. Korean are known for their products and this one does not disappoint even during the winter dey weather, it hydrates and sits well under makeup.

Only con to me is the packaging. I wish it came in a tube for easier travel. * Got this as a freebie and I absolutely love it! I purchesed a bigger size. Its soo cooling and hydrating. Doesnt pill like some moistureizers and isnt sticky. * I have used this product for several year and loved it, but the new formula is drastically different and makes my skin burn and leaves my skin feeling greasy. The scent used to be a natural herbal scent, but now smells like chemicals. So sad and disappointed, I would've stocked up on the original formula if I'd know they were going to ruin it! * I'm not sure why rhis doesn't habe more reviews this is the best moisturizer ever.

My moth bought it fir ke as a teenager when i struggled with acne and it was one kf the only skjncare products that actually helped. I just love how my skin feels arter using it. I like that it doesnt really foam. Its like a oil cleanser snd water based cleanser in one as far as skin feel.

It takes off mascara, eyeliner, lipstick, eye brow pencil and any other waxy type make-up applications, without leaving a greasy film like eye make-up remover. Leaves my face feeling clean and not over striped. It has a light scent that does not linger. It doesn't foam much and is more of a light cream texture. I can wash around my eyes and eyelids then rinse without, eye irritation. I have sensitive eyes. 
I use a separate foaming cleanser (Tatcha Rice Wash) in the shower with a silicone scrubber for skin exfoliation and a deeper clean. * I'm 71 yrs old and my face has been breaking out.

I only use this cream and the serum from this line, but I've noticed a significant difference in the firmness of my skin. I have weird skin. I had cystic acne when i was younger and now I'm dry most of the time. I was using Perricone MD but had used Clinique years ago. I was looking for something with a wow factor that was less pricey. I definitely found it in this cream! It's super creamy, doesn't take much product, absorbs like a dream. And fragrance free! * I find I can only use this at night because it sloughs off so much if applying foundation on top in the morning. Wish I would have just gotten the new night mask. * I feel like I've tried hundreds of different moisturizers. Many sit on top of my skin or feel heavy especially once you add sunscreen on top. This product absorbs quickly and actually makes my skin feel and look plumped. It also feels cool which I like a lot and has a clean, non-offending scent. It's a thick cream that's soft & pillowy and improves my skin's overall appearance. * I started with the sample.  I loved it.  Very creamy.  A little goes a long way. * I was concerned about the switch to a new line of creams as I've been using the old smart night cream for years as a night cream, but overall have been satisified with the change. I'm 29 and was recommended by an Ulta employee in the store the lifting face + neck cream. The cream is a completely new product. It is thicker, much firmer texture than the old one. It is also bright white. It does not have a noticeable fragrance. (The jar says fragrance free). I use it as a night cream and can definitely see and feel the difference in 'firmness' and 'lifting' in my neck; although I didn't think I really needed it and that wasn't why I used the original night cream. I have noticed some white heads in my forehead/T-Zone, but I tend to get them occasionally anyway so I can't blame the cream on it. After reading about the other variations, I wish I had the SPF version so I can try wearing it twice a day with my makeup over it. I'll be giving this one to my mom and trying the SPF one next. :) * This is returnef the plumpness to my cheeks has lifted my laugh lines and I don't look as sallow under my eyes. This cream is amazing I thought I needed a facelift but after using this clinically proven product were 100% of women saw results I'm in love. I've never had more compliments on my skin and I'm 62."

Once it seems ""empty"", I pry it apart and find very little is left...maybe enough for one application, but clearly the packaging is designed so you get all the product with no effort and it cant be contaminated . I also use a Lancome serum every morning, and the two products seem to have made an amazing difference. * Within a few days I saw fine lines going away withour peeling or burning like a stronger retinol.

It also is a fantastic retinol seum in cream! Goes on smoothy and feels good on the skin. * I buy this It product when it is on sale,  as the product itself is OK.   HOWEVER, I wish they would change the pump lid....it works a few times and then stops.  You end up having to unscrew it just like a normal jar to get the moisturizer out.

I've used it for years along with their gentle face wash. * I have extremely sensitive skin and live in a dry climate. I have tried multiple moisturizers ranging anywhere from more natural, low-ingredient to high-end, dermatologist grade. Everything either made me breakout, left my skin red and still dry, and in some cases even caused chemical burns. I've tried brands like CeraVe, Ethique, Clinique, Dermalogica, etc. and none seem to help. After doing some research, I saw others say this low-ingredient, fragrance-free moisturizer helped them. After only a few uses, I was AMAZED!! My skin stayed hydrated all day, was noticeably less red, and wasn't breaking out. 
I would say maybe start with the lotion if you're on the oily side or live in a more humid climate. But as someone with already dry, sensitive skin and living in a dry climate, this has worked WONDERS. Cannot recommend enough. I hope the formula never changes! * This was a highly recommended product on tiktok so of course i had to try it out. Its a good price for the amount you get, but not a good moisturizer in my opinion. The product did not absorb at all, sat on top of my skin all night, quite sticky, and made it impossible to get comfortable since my hair would get stuck to my face if i moved.

it made my sensitive, skin happy all summer. I'm going to keep it going the rest of the year. * Great, light weight moisturizer for summer months.  Non greasy, and absorbs quickly.  No residue on my hands.  My face feels hydrated and soft all day long.  Would highly recommend and I plan to re-purchase for next summer!  (I need something heavier for winter months as I have very dry skin). * I enjoy this product - I feel like it does moisturize my face, and I love how it makes my skin feel. However, I feel like it could be just a little better. I find I need to use more than one pump, and I don't understand why I should need to use that much moisturizer. It does work, though. I'm curious to see how long the tube lasts! * Evryone seems to like this but i really dont it burns when i put it on and i feel like it may be worsening my acne im going to try the cera ve pm moisturizer and am one and hopefully those r better * I hate feeling greasy. This moisturizer really penetrates my skin and leaves it feeling soft and good!! I cannot stress this enough, I have tried soo many moisturizers and I really like this one a lot. * moisturizing but doesn't sit well under sunscreen or foundation...pills up."

Not too heavy but covers perfectly. * It contains 3 highly pore-clogging ingredients for acne prone skin! Alcohol, shea butter, and coconut! Beware if you have acne. I tried it once and it broke me out! Now I've spent weeks trying to clear up my skin. * I went into Ulta looking for a new, clean face cream, eye cream and face tint. Ended up buying all of that and the primer. I've been using it all for 5 days now. My skin has never been dryer!! It's all going back! Almost $300 and, for me, it's awful. * Based on the reviews, wanted to try out something new. I was in search of a better moisturizing cream. This wasn't it. First off, is it me or does it smell like Windex? The worst part, ended up with some serious cystic acne. And I'm over 60 years old! Extremely disappointed. Would not recommend."

It is always available on cruise ships * I've been using this product for over 13 years and absolutely love it!! I am a great grandmother and am told I look much younger than my age!! * I have very sensitive skin and many facial products turn it red.  Dermatologist recommended Cerave or Cetaphil so I used those products for years.  Redness went away, but my skin was always pretty dry, especially my forehead.  Thought I'd try Elemis.  Very happy to say my skin did not redden and the dryness is pretty much gone.  I also really like the smell.  Has a spa smell in my opinion.  However, I would prefer to not apply perfumes products to my face, so would greatly appreciate a fragrance-free version.  Actually surprised the fragrance hasn't caused irritation.  The other thing I wish for is more product for the price.  The packaging is quite large and heavy, but upon opening, you realize there is little product compared to the size of the container.  Despite the fragrance, which again - I do like - and the amount of product for the money, I'm definitely going to continue using this Elemis product. * I absolutely love this product and make my skin feel amazing.   I have used so many, but nothing compares to this face cream. * I found this product 3 years ago while in the Caribbean; so excited to see it available at Ulta. * I really like the texture and smell of this cream. Not sure how effective the spf 30 is as I really haven't worn it outdoors much. Found out they use this line on Disney cruises so makes it feel more special. It's definitely a splurge but I like it a lot."

After I finished using the sample I decided it was worth the heftt investment. A little goes a long way. It's a superior product! * I used this clinique smart clinical repair cream n 1 eye & used estalauder revitalizing cream on the other eye for 2 weeks. I could tell more of an improvement in my crows feet w/ this product. Ive used many eye products and this is my favorite! * This moisturizer pills on freshly washed and exfoliated skin. I will be returning it. * This was thick, probably due to the spf. I didn't feel like it really soaked in to my skin. My makeup seemed to sit on top of my skin and it appeared dry."

Its light weight keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day. I also like that it doesn't counteract to my make-up. Nonetheless, I will be a returning user. * I've been using this moisturizer for the past 8 mo. day & night. It's super hydrating and absorbs into the skin nicely. I have combination skin & live in Chicago- no issues so far in the winter / summer temps.

Have used it along time. * Love this product.  Really does smooth bumpy dry skin. * I have tried others and so far this one is very good. Bought it for my boys. * Works wonders and helped with my bacne * My dermatologist recommended CeraVe SA for my psoriasis flare ups and it's been very helpful.  I prefer it to using steroids or other topical prescriptions whenever possible.  Great product. * Super expensive… but this is the only lotion that doesnt cause breakouts on my back and I actually notice the amount of back breakouts have lessened when i use this. 
Makes my skin feel really soft instead of just coated. * I could have sworn I remembered this being a holy grail product for the acne on my back and shoulders, and I also remembered it being significantly less expensive than it is now. Now, it contains mineral oil and has done nothing to help my body breakouts - in fact I feel more greasy and more broken out than before! Works okay for other parts of my body less prone to acne (like fighting ingrown hairs on legs, etc) but it's just too expensive for the ingredients list now."

So far this product has left me pleasantly surprised, it didnt leave me a greasy mess at the end of my work day. I will add that I hydrate and moisturize well before applying this to keep my skin balanced. I think that others who say they are left greasy probably have dehydrated skin. Making sure you not only moisturize your skin but hydrate it as well! * This did nothing for pores or oiliness.  Wish I could still return it. * Does not mattify or control oily skin.  Just terrible! * I beg you Murad, never get rid of this product. It has changed my skin so much. I used to fight my oily skin constantly. With this I feel like I have normal skin I don't have to worry about mid-day.   I stop myself from overstocking because I'm scared it'll stop being made. If you have oily skin I implore you to give this a try. * This is fine on its own for a workout, but it pills horribly if you put any makeup on top. No oil control. Very thick formula that does'nt spread easily, so you'll go through the tube very quickly. * I have oily, sensitive skin so it is very difficult for me to find a daily sunscreen. Finding this has changed my life!"
112,the ordinary,natural moisturizing factors + phytoceramides moisturizer,pimprod2037765,2606219," * I use this for slugging 3 times a week. it's fantastic! * I'm not 100% sure how to feel about this yet. I bought a small tube directly from The Ordinary website as part of a recommended regimen the website came up based on my skin type. I used all of the small tube, then came to Ulta to buy the larger size. I think it's doing alright in moisturizing my very dry skin overall. I am using it in the morning and at night. It you use more than a tiny bit, it does feel very greasy and the skin doesn't seem to drink it..it feels like it just sits on top. At night I feel the need to add more than I do in the morning so I do get this gross greasy feeling but I notice in the morning my skin looks good and feels moisturized so it's not doing a terrible job. 

The strange thing about it is that although while I'm applying it, I don't notice any scent, after a few minutes I get a faint scent, almost like gasoline, stuck in my nostrils and I can slightly taste it too. If I smell my hands directly (which I rub with left over product) I don't smell anything but somehow I pick up a scent/taste just from it being absorbed into my skin and it's a bit off-putting. Very chemically.

I'm not sure if I'm going to keep purchasing after I make it through this huge tube but for now it's ok enough to continue using until I finish and maybe experiment with something else. * I bought this moisturizer due to the reviews about it being great for dry skin. Unfortunately it did not feel hydrating at all it set on top of my skin like a greasy film and immediately began to pill off… will sadly be returning. * Great product and value. My 50 yo dry skin is loving it. My regular winter moisturizer just wasnt cutting it. This helps so much. Love! * This is incredibly moisturizing without being heavy. The big tube lasts a long time. * I live in CO and even face oils are not cutting it for keeping my skin hydrated. This moistizer is a holy grail in winter for keeping my skin consistently hydrated. I have oily skin thay tends to be dehydrated, as well as senstitive acne prone. Doesnt break me out at all * a little goes a long way. I also use it on my eye area. I have dry skin, in the winter it is upsetting how dry my skin gets. this moisturizer saved me from tears. I tried to get a lighter lotion for the summer time but was not happy when I wasn't getting the same amount of moisture so now I use this year round, just a SMALL dab. the price point and product result get 5 stars."

Is a mediocre product. * I wish I could afford the day cream in this brand with the sun protection SPF. But I could only afford one product so I chose this one and I'm glad I did. It's an incredible night cream. I wake up with the softest face and skin. * I was lucky to get this 50% off during Ulta sale. The more I use it the more I like it. I think its a great morning cream and it rivals the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Youth cream. It does well under makeup. Its also good for my dry skin without it being too oily for day time. I would like to try the one with SPF. * I bought this during the sale at 50% off. I think its a perfect cream for dry or combo skin. It doesn't leave my skin too greasy, but rather hydrated. * I recieved a little sample packet of this cream in an order. My skin isn't very sensitive, so I always try out samples. Nice way to discover new products!

After using this product, I had to double check to make sure I wasn't using a cream cleanser. The frangrance threw me off; It smells heavily of soap to me. Like bar soap. I wouldn't perchance this for myself, because I feel like I need to rinse off. However, I love the consistency and would like it very much if it didnt have that soapy smell. :/"

I like the packaging and the amount of product for the price. * I am very sensitive and dry. This product helps my face feel plump in the morning and gives it hydration. I am on my third bottle and I have not had any irritation. * Amazing pls buy * I love this sleep mask! It is so hydrating, and makes my skin super soft the next day! I love how you don't have to wash it off too! I would definitely recommend this product! * My daughter loves her skin care routine!! * I just love it moisturizer * No problems here!

Keeps my skin feeling moist and smooth all day with no burn (I am not a retinol beginner).  Love these produxts, and yeah the funky smell and texture is because these are clean products instead of chemicals! ❤️❤️❤️ * I've been through 3 bottles and haven't noticed any significant difference in my skin. It was helpful when I had some breakouts in clearing them in a timely manner, but other than that, nothing. I decided to branch out recently and try another retinol product from a different brand, and I'm realizing what I've been missing out on, and at a lower price point! Overall, I don't hate it, but it really did nothing for my skin. * I love it! I have a combination skin. My t zone always gets oily with white heads. I started using it last year and it really helped clear and brightened up my face. I continue to use it since it keeps white heads away and oiliness at bay. * Love the way it leaves my skin feeling.  I wasn't going to try but had to check it out.  And it was definitely worth my gold coins. * Smaller than the free samples it came with * It is a strong product that must be used as directed. If used properly it will reveal a brighter, better looking skin. * No negative side effects even using it overnight. But I noticed absolutely no difference in my skin after 2 months. It's way too expensive to not show any improvements."

Smells nice and feels great when you put it on but the pilling is awful. * I love the Biolumin C serum but this moisturizer pills when you put makeup over it. Disappointing. * I am a big Dermalogica fan, however, this product was a disappointment.  I cannot use it for daytime under my makeup as it causes a ""pilling"" effect as I apply my foundation.  I use it only at night before bedtime.  I use the Biolumin-C vitamin C SERUM under my eyes, morning and night, and love it. * This product is too expensive for it to peel all the way off when I put sunscreen on. * I love this brand and have tried MANY different items, this one is new to me and I am in LOVE! The consistency is just perfect, not too greasy and absorbs well into skin. Wish they made in larger size. * The scent is perfect and the next day you are beautiful. * Smells very nice and I use the cleanser before putting this on. I do notice after a while, I'm left with a residue that comes off despite not wearing makeup. I have mixed feeling about it because of the residue."

I use it both day and night. It leaves my skin feeling so good! Great under makeup, too. I just wish I could get the lid off to get the last bit of product. * I have very sensitive, breakout prone, and aging skin. This is the best moisturizer that i have found and trust me… I have tried too many. My only complaint is that the product is inside a bag inside the bottle and the top doesn't screw off so i feel like im waisti g product when its two empty to pump and I can't access the insode to scrape out the remaining moisturizer. * I switched to this from the blue bottle and im so glad. It absorbs well, softens skin, and doesnt leave skin greasy or tacky. I would buy a big bottle of this. I wish it werent so expensive. * I was looking for something that might be better than the Cerave lotion I was using for a long time that had parabens in it. My skin is sensitive and lots of things tend to irritate or break me out. Nothing changed but this lotion. I don't know what's in it that did it, but I immediately started breaking out. It claims to be for sensitive skin, but I'll take the parabens over that. And they've recently taken them out. So I won't be using this lotion. * This is not gentle whatsover!!! It smells like paint thinner and Shea butter not in a good way either.. I was lit up like a red tomatoe.. horrible horrible .. stay away its not for sensitive skin.. adding cheap ingredients and hiking up prices is what most everyone is doing now days.  Nothing is of any quality only for profits.  It's already a super small bottle for a high price tag now its not even worth using if it manages the barrier too.. ughhh * I have severe rosacea and am on the hunt for an affordable moisturizer.  I currently use environ super moisturiser but it is costly. 
I bought this La Roche posay moisturizer and it burned immediately. 
my skin is still recovering as this caused my rosacea to flare up.

Also, it broke me out and blurred my vision a bit. After a couple of minutes, I noticed that my skin was turning red. It was so bad that I had to wash it off. * Used 2 for gifts for my daughters teachers and kept the 3rd for myself. It feels so weightless on my face, no grease and great coverage.

I love that it's not irritating at all and safe for sensitive and acne prone skin. Everything about this is 10/10. New holy grail. * I really like this moisturizer it is really easy to blend into your face and it feels really hydrating * This is a perfect moisturizer for my skin when it's really dry during the winter and the season changes. I love the not too creamy consistency and the excelent blend of hydrating ingredients to help repair my skin. I'm currently using it after my cerave moisturizing lotion at night for extra hydrates and glowy skin in the morning. I also have combinati on skin, but I've been using some prescribed products since february 2024. * I have really sensitive skin but this is one of the few moisturizers that doesn't irritate it. It's light and moisturizing. Would recommend! * I have very acne prone, sensitive skin. I can't even explain how much this product has helped my skin, and as a teen, this product is very affordable!

I have very sensitive combo skin so I have to be careful (I break out in a rash). Well, after using this product for over a month now, I can feel the difference in my skin. It's smoother and I feel like I'm not as oily prior to use. I only use it at night. The product itself is not greasy and a lot goes a long way. I have put this in my daily skin care regimen. * Love it and have had no reactions from it, which is saying domething. * I was incredibly excited to try this given the amazing reviews. However, this didnt absorb in my skin and rolled/peeled off. After about 3 months, the entire container congealed together and is a solid clump in the container. Terribly disappointed for the price of the product. It was a complete waste. * I got a sample of this cream - it was in a glass jar, figured it was too good to just throw out so I decided to offer it to my mom first. Pretty much all skin care (except my korean spf) makes me break out. Anyway, a few days later my mom was raving about how incredibly well this moisturizer plumps her skin and fills her wrinkles. I researched this TBT cream online it found out that its a retinol alternative, which is awesome! My mom is a sun worshipper and these past two summers have left with her fine lines all over her face. She cant use traditional retinols because she has rosacea and very sensitive skin. Just bought her a full dozed jar, Mom approves it and recommends it."
121,clarins,multi-active day moisturizer for lines and glow with niacinamide,pimprod2043929,2620943," * My face is sensitive and oily to normal. This one moisturizer does it all for me. I'm scared to change. * This is an amazing day moisturizer that adds glow, is lightweight but has a luxurious, thick feel to it, smells heavenly (but very light). Filled with natural extracts and antioxidants, it has made a day for my combo skin in late 30s. My skin looks renewed: plump and radiant. Overall, this is better than many other more expensive options and even produces better anti-aging effects on my skin, compared to Clarins' own anti-aging line. I have purchased 3rd jar, and will probably stick with it moving forward as it is very good for my sensitive skin and doesn't clog pores, irritate, or dry it. Love it!!! * I am 55 with very dry skin. I tried this with the other Clarin's serums and even topped it with a vitamin C oil. I dont think it will work for winter. And, I dont see it working for a nightine cream during the winter. It would be a nice moisturizer for summer I believe if you have dry skin. 
For all the other skin types it might work well for you. * I really love this product. I've alternated between a variety of higher end brands over the last 14 years and this is my favorite, and I have tempermental skin. It's so worth it. * Smells absolutely awful. Like the most old-fashioned, cheap perfume. This is meant to be a day cream… I don't know why it smells so incredibly strong and cheap.  I also think I mistook Ulta's ""conscious beauty"" as meaning clean/good skincare.  But that is not what this is. Its full of synthetic/artificial crap… including dyes and fragrance. * I was really excited to try this cream and the first few days it was perfectly fine, until my face started to breakout really bad and still have some scars :( * This has become my go to moisturizer, it has helped with my pores and fine lines alot. I'm 52 but still get oily in my T-Zone. I am surprised by the negative reviews. Its a winner in my book"

Made my face super oily and kinda has a weird minty feeling when applied. I did not enjoy this experience. * This product is so expensive, but i think it can be worth it. I admit it is a little sticky on my face and skin, but that never bothered me. I dont have oily nor dry skin, I glow with this sunscreen on, i put it on before my makeup and it hasnt messed with the application. It doesnt clear my skin, but i dont break out from this product. I burn easily, yet I lathered up in this sunscreen ONE TIME in the morning during a very hot summer, laying exposed under the sun all day at the beach without reapplying and i left with no burn lines or nothing. However, Im unsure about how water resistant it is. The sunscreen is easy to apply, it rubs in so smoothly. Id recommend buying in store because when I ordered online once, the seal was leaking and i had to exchange it, so i would not risk it. While i do wish this was a bit cheaper for the amount of product i get, i havent bought from another brand since i got on this once. On top of that, i love the fragrance of it, it doesnt have that typical sunscreen smell to it which is a bonus. Overall, i havent had an unpleasant experience with this product so far! * This is the best everyday sunscreen and moisturizer you can use.I have a mature skin and my skin glows from this, I have worked as a medical iaesthetician and I would recommend this to everyone.. * I had tried before form a friend and had seen really good reviews.I finally decide to purchase and plan to do so feels so light weight and it melt into skin so easily there is no shine or sticky feeling like other products I have used and have not noticed and white spots * This completely changed my kids adversity to sunscreen. They will happily apply and re-apply this like any other moisturizer. My husband also doesnt mind reapply this even at work. I took my most recent jug on a bachelorette trip and we all left glowing without sunburning. * Really happy with this sunscreen so far! Usually my least favorite part about sunscreen is how oily and greasy I feel and look, but this one dries/absorbs really nicely so I do not look like I am shining/oily from the sunscreen layer.  I also haven't had any issues with staining on clothes, which I have had issues with other sunscreens. * This sunscreen is fantastic! Unlike most sunscreens, this one doesn't have a white cast and it doesn't feel sticky. It's expensive but definitely worth the price."

My state is very dry and I already have dry skin in the first place and this leaves a very nice cooling feeling and it leaves my skin looking so nice and soft * I purchase .5 ounce and I didn't realize how little I got.  it is trial size.  it isn't worth the money I spent and I will be returning it!!!! * There is nothing wrong with this cream. It's good for mild psoriasis, gentle on flakey skin and non-comedogenic. But I don't find it better than most other moisturizers and treatments for my occasional flakes. I find azelaic acid and retinoids produce better results, so this cream doesn't add much to my skincare routine. I'll use this up, but I don't see myself repurchasing this. * I have alwasy had sensitive skin and recently i just got really bad cystic acne and needed moisturizer that didnt sting my face and this did not bother my skin at all! Dont need a lot for whole face. * I've been using this product for about a week now, and I'm not very impressed. I've been using it morning and night, and continue to have dry skin. * it feels nice on my face but it burns my undereyes and doesn't feel hydrating enough :( but it did calm my acne since this is an oil free product. so i recommend this to oily type of skin. * I've been using this and the face wash for a while now. And fully intend to continue doing so.
Sooths my skin, leaves my skin feeling so nice. Almost everything annoys my skin, these two

I'm on my 4th bottle and feel that the ingredients do work * I wanted something a little more intensely moisturizing for winter since it's been sunny but dry. I put this on then slathered on aquaphor, and I woke up so glowy!! Love love. I hope to be using this in the summer on its own. * I've been using this product consistently for four months, yes its hydrating. But thats just it. It doesnt do much for me, I wish it did more for my skin but yeah, just meh! * This provides deep moisture without feeling too thick or oily. A godsend for my skin barrier * I absolutely adore this brand. I purchased the redness relief calming cream in the past and adored it but wanted something lighter as I have combination skin and this is perfect. Its a soft light moisturizer that doesnt leave me greasy or oily. Its also a fantastic moistuizing base for makeup, will certainly be repurchasing! * I've been on the hunt for a light, hydrating moisturizer since my favorite brand was discontinued, and this one ticks all my boxes. It applies smooth, absorbs fast and leaves my skin soft and happy. I do wish they had a light scent option. * this was one of my favorite moisturizers but it seems to have been reformulated. it's a lot more runny than I remember. I'm assuming it has a lot more water than the last time I've used it, which is annoying enough but it's really hard to apply now because it immediately starts running off of my fingertip"
126,the ordinary,natural moisturizing factors + beta glucan,pimprod2039174,2609860," * After purchasing this moisturizer for a second time, its a hard no. I knew it was more for oily skin so I bought the squalene oil (which is amazing!!!) to help. However after 20 minutes the moisturizer was piling from my skin. I tried using it without my other skin care products but it wss still piling. I loved how it made my skin look and feel but I couldnt wear it at all. * This product has been the ULTIMATE GAME CHANGER for my skin. I have ALWAYS had rough, dry, sensitive skin on my cheeks, with barely a little oil in my T zone. I would also get sebaceous filaments in the T zone (probably because my skin is always super super dry). 

I have tried EVERYTHING to fix this. I thought I wasn't exfoliating enough, or perhaps I simply needed to add more oil products. Everything I tried only made it worse. Then I saw this product and thought maybe what I really needed was a different tactic. Maybe instead of oil based products, I should try doing the opposite. So I grabbed this. 

Within two weeks, the red areas of my skin lightened up - I have had red blotches my entire life so right away, I know somethings up. The sebaceous filaments stopped coming back as fast. My skin stopped being so rough in texture, turning soft and smooth. I stopped needing foundation. No breakouts, nothing. My skin is practically glowing. It's also bouncier???!!

TOTAL GAME CHANGER!

I gotta say though, I was surprised because it acts like a mask more than a moisturizer but I ultimately decided to trust the process. I apply it in the morning, and unlike the oils, it doesnt get absorbed by my skin, or simply get wiped off throughout the day. So if you're expecting it to feel and act like a typical cream, you might be confused when this simply seems to dry on your face. Like I said, it's more of a mask, locking in the moisture, keeping your skin hydrated all day long. 

I put it on in the morning before I leave the house, then again right after cleansing at night before bed. I LOVE that it doesn't wipe off onto my pillow while I'm sleeping. I love that I can simply apply makeup right on top of it with zero issues and it still stays. It has even helped my under-eye area??? 

This stuff is crazy good. I wanted to know what the magic is so I looked up beta-glucan skin benefits and yup, it forms a protective barrier, increases collagen, is anti-inflammatory, and its anti-microbial. I really dont know how this one isnt a cult fave yet. 

I purchased this in store after looking at it here in the app. * I have dry skin and I love this. I use it in place of an essence. I always follow with a heavier moisturizer. Nothing can beat the beta glucan amount found in this moisturizer. * This is a GEL not a cream moisturizer. I missed that word on the package when I purchased it, haha. I have dry, sensitive, and cystic acne, definitely not for my skin. I have developed small sebaceous pimples all over my face over 1 & 1/2 weeks of use. HOWEVER, I do love the other moisturizers from The Ordinary. * it feels like i put a purposefully drying product all over my face. my skin is tight, dry, and sticky for hours after using. i thought at first i was using too much, but it feels the same no matter how much or little i use. * My local store was out of Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA so I decided to try this one. Firstly, it's a gel and not a cream and that should have been my first clue. It applied it and while it went on smooth, that was not the ending result. My face feels like I'm wearing a mask of sorts and my skin does not feel hydrated at all. It feels like a dry cast and during these often dry fall/winter months this is NOT what I need for my skin. 0/10 would not recommend. * works well for my combo skin in the summer.  makes my skin look healthy and hydrated and not oily which i love. the only con is that it is a little sticky on the face, but it's not super bothersome."

It looks the part but once applied dries up insanely quick. I do not have dehydrated skin where moisturizer should be sucked into my skin that fast. I am returning asap! * This does not hydrate the skin AT ALL! It leaves a weird feeling film on your face, and after using your hands and face feel dry istead of moisturized. I would not recommend and definitely not worth your money. * Made my skin super dry! Idk how thats even possible! * Made my skin super dry! Idk how thats even possible! * I got this hoping it would be a good cheap moisturizer but eveytime I used it made my skin feel tight and dry. I stopped using it after I noticed my skin being flakey. * So in have combined type of skin snd im recommending this! It so moisturizing my skin, smells so good, and feel good on skin! * The texture is very watery and gel like snd jist slides around and is very sticky. Dont like it. Wouldnt even use it on the rest of my legs like i do with face products i dont like lol.

They never work because they either don't rub in well, pill, or have a white cast. Not this one! It blends perfectly, wears well with makeup, and feels moisturizing! Can't recommend this enough * Its a great moisturizer that spreads evenly and blends in well, leaving a great glow on the face. BUT once makeup goes over top, it pills soooo badly. I've trued changing foundations and skin prep and it is the same result every time. * This SPF is one of my favs and I always get compliments on my skin being glowy when I wear it! 10/10 recommend. Didn't break me out either! * Not that I had irritation after this, but for my skin gel moisturizers work better, this one was heavy on the cream. I don't remember what my skincare was like back when I used this moisturizer at the end of my routine, but I just felt like it was taking forever to rub in and not really moisturizing my face. Personally felt more like a lotion than a gel cream. If this one doesn't work for you either I'd suggest Byoma's other product, the pink gel moisturizer is what I kept using after this one. * I wanted to like this. Seemed good cause its a light gel moisturizer and goes on nice.  Liked that it has spf. But once it drys on your face it pills so bad. Just makes a mess especially of your layering makeup on too. Definitely would not recommend. * I wanted to love this but it pills sooooo bad!! * I have tried so many different brands of sunscreen. I have very senstive, acne prone, oily skin. This is the first sunscreen that hasnt caused me to break out, leave a white cast, or make my skin burn. And it feels so nice on your skin."

Omg! What a difference. The redness in my cheeks and by the corners of my nose went away. And my skin looked immediately brighter. The feel of the creme itself is SO luxurious and you only need a little bit so it will last a longer time (of course we want that with this price lol) * I love this product and ordered it online for a mother's day gift. However, I somehow got a refill, so it came in a plastic container with a tear-away foil cover and no jar. I didn't even know refills existed for this. I didn't have a container to place it in (other than using a cheap Ziploc bag), so it would have dried out. Hence, I had to return it. I'm not sure if others have had this issue, but Ulta, please be aware! * Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo my mom is a dermatologist and she loves it!!!!!!!! * I have been using this cream for about a month and a half. It feels pleasant and smells beautiful, but does not live up to its claims in my experience. My face does not feel fully hydrated by the end of the day, never mind 24 hours. I have not witnessed brightening or firming. A big selling point (and likely excuse for the huge price tag) is the Grand Rose extract, which Lancôme does a poor job explaining the benefit of. Luckily I had Ulta points to use on this cream, and not my own money. I got roped into the illusion of grandeur and prestige with this Absolue cream. Don't be like me. Much more effective and affordable creams are available on the market. Research ingredients; rose extract offers unremarkable and lackluster benefits. Perhaps the Pro-Xylane and shea butter can, but certainly not in this formulation. * This product is amazing! Expensive as heck but amazing. I originally tried this as a sample and noticed a difference from just the sample. My skin has NEVER felt so soft and smooth! Make sure to purchase when there's a 20% off code otherwise it's a lot. * Most say ""it softens the skin""  Goodness ladies, you can ""soften skin"" with products that are free of chemicals and work to soften.. A cream at this ridiculous price should do more than ""SOFTEN"".. I received a teeny tiny sample of it .. Sorry I don't believe one can see any difference whatsoever with 4 drops of a cream with a strong perfume smell.  I have sensitive skin and perfume is not something I want in a cream * Got sample with other Lancôme product. Best moisturizer on market. Cant tell u how many compliments I have received. I know it's pricey but worth every cent !!"

I'm in my late 40's and this face cream really helped me to feel youthful again. I combine it with the tea tree serum. I feel perfectly hydrated without being weighed down. * Bought the full-size jar after receiving a sample. It's a nice weight without feeling heavy or greasy. Light, pleasant scent. I use it after washing my face at night. Provides ample moisture and skin smoothing and plumping overnight. * Hi Everyone!

So, I very rarely write reviews but this product deserves one. I've been using this product for a little over a week now and it's saved my skin. A little bit about me and my skin concerns: I'm 38, latina with tan skin, no wrinkles but a few fine lines around the corners of my lips. I struggle with eczema on my eyebrows, around my nose and chin. When I started using this cream, I had been dealing with a flare up that was into its 2nd week. 😫 I applied this the same night that I picked it up. Immediately, I noticed the lemony scent and silky feel on my skin. I had no stinging or burning. The next morning, MY FACE WAS CLEAR. No patches, no angry flare up. My skin was glowing and supple. It's been very hot in NJ and I've even used this twice a day with no adverse reaction. My skin looks so much better and that makes me happy. Thank you fresh for this amazing product. I love it. 🩷 * I really wanted to like this, as I tried the lotus day cream in the past and loved it! This time, I got this in the gift set from Ulta (the one you get with minimum purchase), and I am happy I didn't purchase the full size. The cream has a nice texture and smell but it made me break out terribly!!! I definitely wouldn't recommend to sensitive acne prone skin people. Very disappointing. * I have years using this cream. Ordered new one, when I applied it I did noticed the smell was different, I thought was expired. Looks like lots of customers are complaining about a formula changed ? So sad, now I have to find a replacement brand. * This became my new favorite lotion so quick! Super moisturizing but feels light still. Has the best smell ever (not too strong). Highly recommend! * i made the mistake of not doing a patch test. my face broke out from this really bad. it also has a weird strong fruity fragrance??"

I'm on my 4th bottle I like it that much!! * Recieved a sample and used on my seriously purging skin. It never irritating my sensitive skin and actually felt soothing. It took hours to ansorb into my skin and left a slightly greasy feel. I awoke this morning to very happy skin - hydrated, smooth, plump and slightly firmer. Once my current moisturizer is empty, I'll be purchasing. * This is my second time repurchasing. I hate the price but this has made a significant difference in my skin. I have sensitive dry skin and this has given my skin the moisture it needs and an amazing glow. I see others are complaining about it being ""greasy"" i havent had that issue. I apply two pumps to my skin and it gives me the most beautiful glow. I use everything Dermalogica and constantly get compliments on my skin. * This is one of those products that's been life changing in my routine. The way my under eyes look & feels from this product is phenomenal. This has helped with my fine lines and wrinkles. Helped firm my under eyes. Super rich lux formula. A little goes a long way. It awakens my under eyes. * I need moisture, not grease.  So sad. I will be going back to my Drunk Elephant."
135,peach slices,snail rescue all-in-one oil free moisturizer,pimprod2018393,2567117," * this is hands down the best moisturizer for oily skin and has the best ingredients for skin care at the same time. this is so lightweight and feels GREAT. i think I've been thought 5 or 6 bottles of this and will continue. i used to use YTTP before this and i love this much more. it really helps soothe any breakouts and irritation during my period too * Snail mucin is my new go to ingredient and this is very smooth and creamy. It also reports good on the app YUKA. * This is a good price and it works for me very well. I barely have dry skin currently because of this product and normally I am very dry in the winter.  I will buy again. I am a 32 yr old woman * Okay, i have repurchased this mosturizer prob 2-3 times. I use maybe 2-3 pea size amounts once a day at night. Redness went down with this one more than it did with the redness releif product from peach slices, so i think my skin just needed a break. The bottle doesnt last very long (around 3 months which is quite short for me, as I am a student and dont want to spend $60 a year on mosturizer lol). My last 2 bottles I noticed that overtime, if there is a little bit of product left on the tip, the packaging will degrade and the cap wont be able to turn back on. The ridges where the cap is usually secured comes off, so there is not air tight seal. Other than that, i love the product, the packaging not so much. Due to this reason, i will be looking for a new mosturizer. If you really want to try it out though, I recommend storing it upside down and wiping the cap with a clean towel regularly. I dont like doing this though because i dont like to touch the applicators of my products. * I recently got this moisturizer more than a week ago at my local Ulta store.i wanted to try something new and more affordablle for me.A few days later i started having the worst breakouts ive had in a while and my skin has been drier and flaky.This is definitely  not for my combo/oilly acne prone skin.do your research before you by this. * I was looking around ulta in store for a moisturizer and an employee came to help and recommended this. I would recommend this brand in general due to the gold ingredients. It is a very good moisturizer to keep my acne in check. * This product caused me to get little red dots on my face and caused breakouts."

I'm not sure if product is not a match with my toner or retinol but when applying it gives me a burn sensation and I look red but then it goes away. Product didn't work for me. It's probably a match for other type of skin but not with mine. * Definitely try a swatch of this product in store before you buy. I do not have sensitive skin but I reacted to this product within like a minute of trying it in Ulta. So glad I tried before I buyed. The texture of the product was nice though and smelled good so if your skin doesn't react I'm sure its a great product. * My makeup used to blend beautifully over this and feel so luxe. New formula broke that. So disappointing. Why break something that has awesome reviews…it's so hard to get customers to come back after leaving. * I had a sample that I used and loved, so I decided to buy it. Well, this must have been an old sample since I saw other comments about their formula change. This version made me break out in hives and was very itchy. Have to return. So sad because the old version was awesome. * I really like this! I am out of my first jar and will be buying another one this week! Try it!

I never write reviews but honestly the improvement in my skin's uneven tone/hyperpigmentation and fine lines- especially on my neck, have  improved considerably.

I've tried it with different serums and oils - no matter what combo I try, it pills terribly. Today, since I had no plans to leave the house, I decided to try it without any other product. You guessed it....it still pills, not as much as when it's combined, but annoyingly nonetheless. I'm quite disappointed. * I really tried liking this product, I've absolutely loved all my PTR products and never had a bad experience but the smell is extremely unpleasant and th product pills like crazy. I originally tried this as a face moisturizer under my Supergoop makeup primer and noticed the pilling and originally though it was a reaction between ingredients so I switched to using it at night and when I used my face oil on top I had the same problem with pilling. if I put any product on top of this moisturizer it always pills up and I have to try to wipe my face after application. I have used different moisturizers under my makeup primer and face oils and have never encountered this problem. Moisturizer is never my final step in my skin care routine morning or evening so it is extremely difficult to use and not have it pill up. I have to skip steps to be able to use this moisturizer and if the smell and texture/consistency blew me away I would consider it but it overall leavs me super disappointed. Will honestly just end up throwing out what I have not happy with the product at all, I can easily find much better results and moisturizers overall * I have very sensitive skin and have been trying to find a product that works for me for so long! I usually cant tolerate any actives/acids but because this is in a cream its working wonders for my skin. Its the perfect amount of moisture with exfoliation that has cleared my breakouts!!! * I was really excited to try this moisturizer because I really liked how it felt on my skin but if I pair it with any serums or other products this moisturizer peels. * Love this * Good cream.  Noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. * I wanted to love this SO BAD. I don't have sensitive skin… however… this makes my face turn super red causes insanely itchy skin. Keep in mind I never get reactions to skincare. I still use it about once peer week as a ""treatment"" since its super strong and invasive. I think its because a lot is going on with this moisturizer. I still love this brand though! Its just a strong product."

With its thick moisturizing consistency I'd say it's a little thicker than anticipated and took some getting used to. Also, I'm an extremely sensitive skinned person that breaks out easily with some scents & comedogenic products. After several weeks of usage I did feel it smoothed my neck, however I did experience some breakouts on my face. I would probably use this product as more of a summertime SPF than a daily moisturizing cream. * 'LOreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer, Pro Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin C to Reduce Wrinkles, Firm & Brighten Skin really does what it claims and MORE! I use this in the morning after I wash my face, but before applying my foundation for the day. It's an integral part of my routine to also use this in the evening after I remove my makekup for the day, but before bed. This leaves my skin hydrated yet moisturized, but also acts as a solid base for my foundation making it not only stretch farther but also moisturizing my skin and helping with fine lines and wrinkles that come with aging. I LOVE the versatility of this product and its light scent. This is one of my most favorite staples and I highly recommend L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer, Pro Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin C to Reduce Wrinkles, Firm & Brighten Skin. Give it a try, I think you'll love it. * Don't be fooled by the little jar, this cream packs a lot of punch. One of the best things about it, is that it pulls double duty as a day cream with the SPF and night cream. Using it at night gives the skin that little bit of extra moisture needed for night time. I can definitely see a difference in my skin after using this for almost a month.  I was given this product in exchange for an honest review * Such a perfect day cream! I received this product about a month ago and have been consistently using it day and night. Even in the winter, I can go all day and night with my skin not only feeling baby smooth soft, and not greasy or shiny. When putting it on, I was struck by the thickness of the cream, yet it slides on easily and just melts into the skin. I am so happy it has spf 30, so I feel confident using it during the daytime. It doesn't roll on the skin, and also does not make my makeup slip off. I could barely smell a scent, and it just lifts up the face and gives it a nice, subtle glow. I also noticed a marked improvement in the texture on my neck. Love it!! * I received This free in exchange for my honest review. This one now replace my much more expensive lotion. It has wonderful ingredients and left my skin feeling so smooth. Blurred my lines and pores. I love the scent of this. I will definitely be repurchasing this. Works much better than the more expensive brand. * Goes on smooth and evenly. I've used this product every day since I received it.

I now have a newfound respect for Oatmeal as an active ingredient. * I have been using this for years but since they changed the formula I developed a rash around my eyes and rashes on my face.

From the moment I started using it, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin's hydration levels. The formula is incredibly nourishing and leaves my skin feeling soft, supple, and oh-so-hydrated. What's more, it doesn't just provide a temporary moisture boost – it actually helps to lock in hydration throughout the day, keeping my skin looking and feeling its best. * I used this moisturizer for fine lines on my face . It definitely helped fade it little bit . If I consistently use it , it should go away. 
It's also giving the healthy skin look . 
I received this moisturizer as complimentary from strivectin. * I'm eager to try this to tackle my stubborn wrinkles.

I wish I could love it but I've found something less creamy that acts more like a primer and doesn't make my eyes burn and water all day 😢 * Makes my skin look beautiful! * And gave me a bad taste in my mouth. Going back to Mario Badescu. Not worth the extra sun protection. * This is a great one step. Works well for dry or combo skin. Love the texture. Its also THD Ascorbate. * nice * I am a redhead with freckles and sun/age spots. I bought this cream to use on ny face both for the SPF and to fade freckles. My skin had some sensitivity issues a couple weeks after I started using the product - redness, small blisters and peeling. It might've been this product, might not, but i still have not recovered. Waited too long to return it and so I started using on my neck and chest without issues. I wear a lot of V-neck tops, and noticed my freckles and dark spots faded surprisingly quickly! I'm not sure if I will buy it again, but it DOES work. On the downside it has an unpleasant citrus scent. Im not usually bothered by scents but I'm not fond of this one. * Left my skin greasy and shiny but did not moisturize my skin. Would not recommend to use, did not see any improvement in my skin just felt like putting oily sun screen on my face."

This water cream saved my winter dry skin and did not bother either of my sensitivities.  A little goes a long way and feels light on the skin with a very light, fresh scent.  I have purchased this 3 times and intend to continue using it. * Absolutely love this product, its now been my main moisturizer for over a year! Its light, has a vague fresh scent, very moisturizing! I it think can work for most skin types. I have normal-combination skin. A good friend of mine has more oily skin and she loves this as well. * I got a sample of this from a family member and was obsessed!

It is so hydrating and long lasting but doesn't feel heavy! * Moisturizes without oiliness and does not clog my pores. It leave my skin soft and makeup goes on much smoother. * An associate turned me on to this product.  My makeup was just smearing around my pores until I started wearing this.  Keeps my foundation in place and feels cooling to the skin.  This is my second jar. * I compared this face cream with another water based cream by tarte. Inused the tarte one intil it ran out and the tarte one left my face dry by the end of a work day. My face was bot staying hydrated for even 8-9 hours after application. So once it was done I used the philosophy one that I bought a few months prior. Having another face cream to compare it to was super helpful because I could see fhe hydration last all day with this face cream. It has a great fresh smell and even makes my face glow a little."

This brand is my new go-to.  It is light, dewy, and does what i need it to do.  I also love the price. * I've used this moisturizer a few times. So far I'm liking it, it goes on smoothly and doesn't feel sticky. * I love the sleek, black packaging. However, I do not understand all the good reviews.  I have extremely oily skin, and this ""dewy"" cream made my skin very dry and tight every time I used it. I very much prefer the dewy skin cream from Tatcha. * Im almost done with it and can say that im disappointed it was not hydrating. I put a good amount too to make sure and nothing. I really liked the toner so i wanted to try the day cream but i honestly didnt like it. For the price you could spend the same or spend a little more and get a better product * I've tried many many moisturizers over the years ranging from $45-$200 and this one is my absolute favorite! It'll be the one i get from hear on out. Im 49 and in my llayer year have experienced dry skin. Which looks like old skin . But this moisturizer is so good my skin looks younger! * I recently had almost a chapped texture to my skin I'm not really sure why but this cream is so hydrating it took care of all the issues I was having. A little goes such a long way. I have pretty sensitive/combination skin. * Received a GWP sample from Ulta.

I love it * Glad I received this as a sample because I've been wanting to try this product for a while, but the price was pretty high for a product I just wanted to try. The first try was very gritty and it burned so bad I had to wash it off. I thought maybe the product needed shaken up better so I shook it up a lot and pumped out a few pumps into the trashcan to clear out the tubing before I tried it a second time a few days later, and it was still very gritty and burned. I thought maybe the burning would subside so I tried not washing it off this time but after 10 minutes, I couldn't take it anymore and had to wash it off.  I gave it a third try a few more days later and same thing: gritty and burned. * Works amazing! * This is perfect for on-the-go travel. Minimizes dark undereye circles and is very pleasant to apply. All of the BeautyStat Cosmetics are wonderful. You can't go wrong here! * I tried a sample of this and loved the results on my skin will purchase in the future the full size. * love it so much helped my skin be new again * Goes on gritty lkke an exfoliator and burns.

As soon as I opened the packaging, I was hit with the aggressive smell of this product and was transported back to my grandmother applying her heavily scented products in my youth. Since I had no other moisturizer with me, I used it and my combo acne prone skin informed me that I had offended it with the noxiously scented product. My skin was irritated and my husband, who has the worst sense of smell ever, could smell this product through a couple layers of product.

So needless to say, I do not recommend this product. * I had a bad experience with this cream. I have used this brand for many years because its products are made with high-quality ingredients, and it always tries to take care of the skin. But this cream, besides having a horrible and extremely strong smell, filled my face with pimples, made me look like a teenager, and dried out some areas of my face. It was a total disappointment. * loved the way it made my skin feel
but can't get past the strong fragrance * The texture of the cream is very light. I like how it applies smoothly on the skin. But it has a strong baby powder smell and it makes my skin look so greasy after a while. * Love this lightweight moisturizing gel cream. Also my husband always gives me compliments when he kisses my cheek because he loves the clean fresh scent of this cream. * I use several Avene products. I sometimes can't wait for this step in my skincare routine. I just love how good it feels going on.  It locks in moisture without feeling oily, too thick or too heavy. * This gel moisturizer seeps into the skin nicely, a little goes a long way. I have eczema, when it was super raw this did sting a little. The baby powder smell is OK, didn't bother me and I didn't love it either. This gentle yet effective for dry skin days. I love that it's non-comodogenic, for reference I have oily/dry combo skin that is acne prone."

I feel so much more confident as a 24 yo in my aging skin. Gentle and effective. Love avene products! Just the best * Let me start off saying I really DO like this! I have 36yo DRY skin and I was getting a little peeling and dry patches from my Rx Tret. once a week, but had zero irritation using this every night! It's a pretty thick cream consistency so not the easiest to spread on its own IMO. I like to use a serum before this Retrinal .5% to help it glide on the skin easier. One pump usually does it, but sometimes I add just a tiny bit more if I feel like I didn't get even coverage. It's definitely a long term product so don't expect immediate results. I DO wish Ulta carried the 1.0 version of this instead of just the .5%. * I just bought this product and I am loving it. I can't speak on results yet but as someone with oily/acne prone  skin, I feel like I finally found an anti-aging product that absorbs well and doesn't break me out. It may feel slightly ""heavy"" at first but it absorbs. Great for sensitive skin, as well! So happy I found this brand * I tried a couple of retinal creams, and had breakouts and/or burning. Having used many Avene products with great results, I took their skin quiz online, and this product was recommended. It is a great alternative to retinol, at a very low dosage so you can start to build use. I've had great success with it, and it is helping with fine lines around my eyes. I can use it every night with absolutely no irritation."

It did! I have sensitive skin, both oily and dry if that makes sense. This product goes on smoothly, blends in vs. typical sunscreens that never seem to soak into the skin. I will say I noticed a pretty strong scent of sunscreen when I first opened it. Now, just a few days later, I don't notice it at all. I love how this makes my skin feel hydrated but not oily. And it lasts all day. I apply once in the morning after washing my face and same routine at night. * Absorbs easily and great balance of moisture and sun protection for casual outside time. I'd still put another sunscreen on if I was spending concentrated time in the sun. * I originally received a free sample and fell in love. I ordered the moisturizer and it is not the same at all. My face started stinging and itching after the second use and it doesnt go on as smooth. * i loved this product for so long, but didnt realize that it what was breaking me out. i tried a different cleanser, added an exfoliater etc. NOTHING would get rid of the harsh bumps all over my face. not until i researched and found out it had safflower it in which (can) support fungal acne. i have dry, sensitive acneic skin so this may work for others but definitely not for me. very disappointed and wish i found out sooner. not even 3 days after stopping this product, my skin is clearing up. * I used to be a big fan of the Superscreen Daily Moisturizer, and although they kept the packaging the same, they changed the formula and the name to Superscreen Hydrating Daily Cream. I think brands should be more transparent about informing their customers that they're actually buying a different product than what they're used to. The consistency of the new cream is thicker and harder to spread, but what stands out the most to me is the smell: somewhere in between Play-Doh and generic baby sunscreen. My partner has sensitive skin around his eyes, and the old formula didn't cause him any burning, but the new one does. I wouldn't buy this again. * I bought this because it had avobenzone but no octocrylene (at the time). Great texture but I reacted badly to something in it. Guessing it was the algae because I've used the other ingredients before without issue. * DO NOT BUY new formula is horrible. Not the same product whatsoever. Why ruin a great product everyone loved?? Makes no sense. Ive gone through at least 10 of these moisturizers and now i will no longer purchase. And the new scent is a crime against humanity."

Thanks for a great product. * The water cream made me break out. The gel works much better for me. I will go back to that formulation. * I like this cream it goes on smoothly. * The results I've noticed after 3 weeks of using this are truly amazing. My skin has never been this soft or smooth. I've also noticed the darkness under my eyes has drastically changed, which I was not expecting. This should be a staple in everyone's skin care routine especially in the winter months! * Tried this product because it was half the price of the one I usually use ( Peter Thomas Roth) This left a very greasy film on my face. * I had used what I now can call the old formula, and did like how my skin felt. I was recommended by my esti to try another brand, but it was just too expensive to continue so I decided to go back to the Neutrogena. Sadly, the formula has been changed, and it is not at all what I experienced previously. I am not experiencing the redness and irritation that others are reporting, but my skin is not moisturized and looks dry and lifeless. My search for a new product begins. * Horrible. This new formula is simply horrible. It dries out my skin, makes it irritated, and leaves a weird greasy film. It pills like crazy and makes my skin horrible. I miss the old formula! It was perfect and always made my skin feel plump and soft. I swtiched to a higher end brand which is working now how this old neutrogena formula used to. Im incredibly disappointed in neutrogena and this product."

I LOVE IT!!! It blends GREAT (especially for a product with SPF), isn't greasy, doesn't make my skin oily or shiny, has not caused a breakout, and I can see a clear difference in the moisture level of my skin in just a few days. Anti-aging creams normally make my skin totally freak out, but this one is all good, no bad. Really glad I happened upon it! * This contains Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene....FYI * I joke that this is my old lady face cream because it smells like a bouquet of roses. However, it really does give the skin a lifted appearance and tightened feel. The daytime version has some SPF and wears nice under makeup. I wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin because of the fragrance. Also, I noticed on very dry winter days the product does not have enough moisture for my skin * I received this as a sample size from Estee Lauder and I can't wait to buy a full size. This is why I love samples, It lets me fiind out what I love without spending a fortune first.  It has the faintest fragrance that is subtle but lovely. It goes on so smooth and is just pleasant to use. My only complaint is the price. Some of us would buy this brand more often if we weren't priced out of the market. This is why I gave it a four. Otherwise, a five all the way. * This smells like febreeze and it doesn't go away when you rub it in :( save your monies * I use this product daily.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. It did not irritate my skin, which can sometimes be an issue for me.  Makeup base glides on smoothly over this moisturizer.  It is my absolute favorite. * I wish I could use this product as it seems to work well. However the fragrance is too strong and irritating."

I just finished up the container and have seen absolutely no difference in my skin. For this price there must be something better out there! * I use this morning and night along with the face and eye serum (same brand) followed by sunscreen (only in the morning). I can truly say that this stuff along with the face and eye serum works. I used to have very dry skin, but not anymore. Also, the hormonal acne I get occasionally is under control. Lastly, the wrinkles are diminishing. Totally worth every penny. * I see smoother skin , brighter skin , less fine lines and an overall younger look * I do love this product, it's true to all things advertised - A little bit goes a long way as I purchased this a few months ago and still have more than half of it left. I did not want to write a review until I was certain I was satisfied based off of the huge expense... 

that said, I wish the product was a bit less expensive because I have tried other product lines that do the same job without the extra $$... but then again, you are paying for the name"

Very moisturizing without a greasy feel. I've noticed much improvement for fine lines. Does not irritate my skin at all. * Been using this product for over two weeks and following the directions implicitly, yet I have seen no signs of improvement. * Really liked the way it went in my face so smooth & moisturerising, definitely but it again * I bought this on sale, wow I use medical grade skin care expensive 🙃

It's the perfecr winter moisturizer. * I do love the product however the design needs to be changed too much waste in a pump design * This is the best facial moisturizer ever!  I ha e been using it for years and there's nothing like it!  My skin feels so hydrated when I use it! * Dermalogica's Stabilizing Repair Cream -that was gifted by Dermatologica- is a game-changer for sensitive skin. Its balmy texture melts into the skin, providing instant relief from redness and irritation while strengthening the skin barrier over time. Key ingredients like Ceramide-Building Complex and Centella Asiatica help the skin build resilience, lock in moisture, and improve firmness. Free from artificial fragrances, this formula is perfect for sensitive types. Clinical results promise visible improvements in just one week, making it a must-have for soothing and repairing your skin. * I love this whole line of products.

I love using this in the winter time at night, i never have dry skin with this. * I love Dermalogica products and this Super Rich Repair is top of the line.

This literally smells like the elmers liquid glue used for crafts in elementary schools. However, I tried it as a night cream for a couple nights and got great results. It didn't irritate my sensitive skin and even helped calm the reddness I get on my cheeks. It meets the balanced of being a thick winter moisturizer without quite being heavy enough to clog pores—least this is my experience as someone with dry skin. It worth trying if you have try skin and need an affordable moisturizer. There are still better option on the market if you are willing to spend more money but this is a great value. * Amazing for my dry skin. With all the products out there it can be rare to find something that has such an immediate effect. The consistency is WEIRD but it truly absorbs super fast. My skin is hydrated and just seems to have a subtle glow. I do recommend having a somewhat consistent cleansing and exfoliation routine w this to help the product really sink in and not trap dead skin. Right now I only use it as an overnight moisturizer but it has been okay under make up if you give it real time to settle in and ""dry down"" 

I will be repurchasing! * I originally got this as a night cream because it's marketed as a heavier moisturizer, but it just didn't cut it overnight for me living in the desert with dry skin. It'll probably be great for people with oily or normal skin overnight. I made this my day moisturizer and it's lovely! Moisturizing without being greasy and my skin tolerates it well. This will be my winter day time moisturizer moving forward. * Because this is advertised as a heavier, winter cream I really thought it would be greasy on my skin. I was so wrong! It does feel a little thick but it rubs in well and absorbs better than any cream I have ever used. I have oily skin and that has even improved a bit. This is my new favorite face cream for daytime use. I will absolutely buy it again. * I was looking for a new night moisturizer- something with a thick consistency. This is definitely thick but kinda…waxy? Not sure how to explain. So i dont love the way it feels on my skin and i didnt find it to be deeply moisturizing. I tried patting it, fully blending, and also just setting it on top of the skin. Didnt do much for me. Just very basic moisture, yet also would be too much to just put on in the morning. Good packaging, smelled nice, and didnt break out my dry, sensitive skin * It reminds me of a mask you would put on and then wash off. Its very rich and thick but its great for these winter months with the cold dry air. I would purchase again for a winter time night time moisturizer. * Very thick cream; trying to use as a nighttime moisturizer but determining the amount to apply isnt easy.  Even a thin layer tends to peel.  Just sort of sits on the skin"

I just turned my husband on to this, too, because he ran out of his facial cleanser and told me that bar soap was making his face feel too tight and dry. * soo good,its my holy grail and i use this everyday * I always use this face wash. It's tried and true. A staple that I use all year round! * This product cleans your skin without drying out your skin. * It's not as gentle on my eyes as Cetaphil. It cleanses makeup just as well, but I do like a one-step cleanser (rather than having to use an eye makeup remover) and this does sting the eyes, just a tad. I'll stick with Cetaphil until I find a better alternative. * Truly an awesome facial cleanser. Someone I know has rosacea on his face and this product is one that helped calm down redness and irritation. Very non-stripping and gentle. The only con I can think of is that it doesn't foam (I prefer foaming cleansers). Very affordable, especially the value size because you get double the amount of product that the regular size contains for only a few bucks more. Great cleanser!"

I also use it on my neck and have noticed more of a difference there than on my face regarding tightening of skin. The cream is fairly light on the skin and is deeply hydrating. I ran out for a week and noticed an immediate difference! It can be a little shiny when combined with sunscreen and makeup however at night it just makes my skin glow. I am 48 and starting to battle some hormonal acne around my chin and mouth area so I have to avoid putting the cream around those areas. If I cant help myself (because it feels so good) I just get a few microscopic whiteheads that go away by the next day. * I love this cream. It feels so smooth. Going on. Has a beautiful texture.

Have used it a couple years now.  Non-reactive on my sensitive skin and feels wonderful on.  I believe it has made a difference in the texture of my skin and improved my neck wrinkles. * Finding the right skin care routine is never linear since it varies person per person. I have sensitive combination skin and I always struggled to find a product that didnt give me that greasy glow. 

This product is light yet hydrating enough that it doesnt require a lot of product. While the price tad is high, the big container last me 2-3 months depending on the weather. 

I would recommend you get a sampler size and try it out for 3 months because you wont see any instant results. After 6 months of using this product, it cleared my blackhead and slowly seeing results in other areas. * I have been using this multi corrective face cream since its arrived on the market, Im 52, it has been a game changer since i traded up from their daily moisturizer( in which i stared at 30. It doing what it needs to do, im not getting wrinkles or dry skin and i use it alone & under make up. I'm often asked if im 35 so i have to give some credit to kehls for it. I love the line, its fine quality and i will never waver! * I bought this after many great reviews. I used it around 10 times and thought it was sunburn because I was red and sore. I switched to e45 then another brand and I was fine. I then tried it again after a couple of weeks and it stung my face again! I usually don't have sensitive skin and I'm gutted I spent so much and now can't use it * Every single thing on my face 'balls up' when I use this moisturizer, including when I use it alone.  It does not absorb into my skin, but just sits on top. I've tried it in so many combinations and it's just incompatible with other skin care and foundations (I've tried several foundations -high end & low end- with same results).  I've also tried using it with serums, different primers, different sunscreens and alone with the same result. This is a hard pass for me."

Cannot figure out which ingredient i would be allergic to. Put Cortizone and neosporin all over my face to calm it down. * Just seemed it wasn't worth the money. It didn't last all that long. I didn't see a difference in my skin."

It's a thicker formula and left me with pilling * I have a light to medium skin tone and the white cast was quite visible until it's absorbed into my skin. however, if I was sweating or my face got wet, then the white cast would be visible again, which I hated since I sweat a lot at my job. * Leaves a white sheen no matter how much you rub it in * It says it's hypoallergenic but my face is full of hives every time I use it * This product has an awful white cast, and I am white. It makes me look so pale. I am so surprised given the price and the fact it is supposed to be a ""daily moisturizer."" Would not waste your money. * I loved the fact that it had hyaluronic acid and SPF in one, but after putting it on, I realize it's definitely not for me. I hoped the reviews were wrong, but it definitely leaves a white cast over your skin, and made me look super pale, despite the fact that I have a fair, medium skin tone. * I have tried almost every mineral sunscreen under the sun. I'm fair skin, freckles, burn easily, break out easily and this sunscreen moisturizer has been amazing. There is a white cast initially but I rub the product between my fingers before applying and it blends within 5 minutes! I never get sunburn on my face while wearing this. I also apply a ceramide barrier serum beforehand and do not experience any dryness while using this product. Would absolutely purchase a cool toned tinted version of this."

All moisturizers I've ever tried have lead to greasy-looking skin, cheap (Aveno) or expensive (like Murad). But this gel is perfect. It's very, very light, so it doesn't turn into an oily mess, but it's moisturizing enough so that my skin doesnt feel tight/dry after application. I love it. And to top it off, it's not too expensive. The search for a good moisturizer is over. God bless. * I like this product. Very good moisturizing for my skin. Doesn't cause break outs. It's a little sticky, but if you plan to put a product over it, it is not at all noticeable. Barely noticeable anyways, just worth mentioning. * This is such an amazing product!  I only make enough to buy the smaller size, but even that small size will last me almost a month, because it only takes a small amount to go over my whole face every night. * I have sensitive, combination, and acne prone skin. I have been using this moisturizer for the past 6 years and noticed a significate improvement in my skins overall health a few months into using this product. I love that it is fragrance free as well. * The original Neutrogena water gel mositruizer didn't work for me because of the fragrance. I'm very happy to see this mositurizer in a fragrance free version! This is a great moisturizer  for oily, sensitive skin. Its provides great hydration and is lightweight, non-irritating, non-comedogenic, and affordable. The new glass jar is a nice touch to make the product feel a bit more elevated. * I used the water gel for years, because it was the only affordable moisturizer I could find that didn't make me break out. I have combination skin. Now with the new formula, I am breaking out like crazy. I will not buy this again. Sadly, I have do go on another quest to find another moisturizer that works for my skin. * NO WAY. IT'S THE SMALL CONTAINER FOR $1 LESS THAN 1.7 OZ.
Don't buy this size at this price. Look around"

Nothing compares. * I have combination skin. This did not break me out. I love how the texture changes once you start to rub it in. However, i wish it absorbed into the skin more completely. My skin feels tacky after using this, so my hair sticks to it. Oversll good tho! * This was recommended by a black dermatologist over a year ago.  I use it in combination with the vit C serum, any Vit C serum will work.  I absolutely LOVE the way this both looks and FEELS on my skin.  It works great with my various varieties of sunscreen, and I've never loved how great my skin looks so much. HIGHLY RECOMMEND * So far I love this product. Gives my face a fresh glow and moisture during this cold weather. I'm not sure if it would be great in the summer. The only issue is that you must dry your skin thoroughly. For some odd reason the texture of the cream changes if there's a hint of water on the skin. * I have very dry skin, and have tried and used over 50 face moisturizers, and this is one of the worst ones. It is SO thick and does not sink into the skin, it feels like its just sitting on top of your skin almost like sunscreen. I REALLY wanted to give it a fair try so I tried it as an overnight moisturizer, and when I woke up my skin did not feel moisturized. * I wanted to try this because it's made with clean ingredients, and ended up being disappointed by it. It left my face feeling oily in some places, and sticky all over. * I absolutely adore this moisturizer! I started using it a year or two ago and I've gone through multiple jars. It's lightweight and the texture is amazing. Starts off as a cream but then it disperses and feels like water on your skin. It leaves your skin so hydrated and dewy looking!"

My skin is extremely sensitive and i also have a bit of rosacea.  Texture is a bit thick but it doesnt leave resedue like others mentioned and it does mouturize the skin well.  

It covers my redness as if im using a bit of foundation so thats also a huge plus, totally recommend!! * It broke my face out real bad.  Carrying it back. * Broke my skin out so bad, chalky trash in 2 weeks it ruined my skin. * Love the idea of the green pigment to cover redness but while applying this product it seems to leave a white film behind - similar to what looks like dry flaky skin. Multiple comments have said the same thing but also mentioned the discontinued formula that seemed to work for them & that they loved, which unfortunelty I have never tried but would love to. I believe the product shouldnt be as much as it costs, for what little it does. I see the idea of what it should be but the formula could be better. That leaves me to say, in regards to the old formula, if its not broke - why fix it??? * This product isn't moisturizing at all. It sits on top of my skin and does little to hide the redness. Would love the old serum. * I started using this product during a hard phase of my rosacea. At first it helped reducing the redness on my face and also helped me with the itching. However, after some days my rosacea went worse, so I dedided to stop using this product which actually made my rosacea to start going better.
I noticed that everytime I tried the product again, the roseacea would reactivate.

I know it has worked for others but my experience was not good. If you have sensitive skin, I dont recommend you this product. * Started working 15 mins after I applied it.  Next morning almost all of the redness gone.  Have a little more clearing up of the bumps but nothing works in a day.  Def recommend."

It is extremely over priced and delivers 0.0 of the results it claims to.  It does not plump, protect, or hydrate.  It also doesn't smell great tbh.  I'm convinced it's an artificial product with a fancy label.  Money making scam 100%! * I love the the way my skin looks and feels I can totally tell the difference. My skin is hydrated. * product smells awful!!! * Tried this moisturizer because i love the cleanser, but its the total opposite. Unlike the cleanser which is light, smells great and leaves skin feeling fresh, this moisturizer is thick, feels heavy on your face, and smells like artificial fruit. Also, the pump is terrible. * This moisturizer is absolutely amazing! My face is so soft and hydrated, I couldn't believe it. The smell is light and fruity. I'm so happy I gave it a try. * Though I do love the way this lotion feels on my skin, I won't purchase this again unless the packaging changes. It feels cheap and only works about 2/3 of the time. The scent of the lotion also takes some getting used to. * I like the feel on my skin. It has a lot of moisture in it and my skin looks good when using.  I get a lot of compliments regarding my skin"

The smell does go away after applying bjt it leaves a  great glow. Id get a lot of compliments going out not long after application * I love this so much its my favorite! makes my skin so soft. * This product brings moisture to my skin & helps decrease lines * I love Philosophy because the products really work! This is my first time trying this particular moisturizer and I love it! I have sensitive skin, & I try to find products that won't make my redness  worse. I just hit 40, and my once combo skin is getting drier, this moisturizer made a huge difference without making me break out. * Have been a Philosophy fan for years. This product, though it made my skin feel soft, has not shown any signs of working on wrinkles or even fine lines. * I love this product!! It gets rid of fine lines and hydrates sk well. * I started using Philosophy when Cristina first launched it & FELL in love. The Hope Moisturizer  made me break out but THIS line works beautuflly! I REALLY miss the jar of  Daily Retinoid pads w/ bottle of solution. PLEASE bring them back!!! MAGIC for my skin! SO many great products! I can choose what works best for me!

For some reason it feels more sanitary to use than dipping your fingers in (even though I do wash my hands between applying products). 

Anyway, I can wear this sunscreen alone. Makes my skin glow so I feel comfortable skipping foundation 😌 * This is my first time working with an spf moisturizer, and honestly I think it does fine. I have oily + acne prone skin so moisturizers are a hit or miss, my only problem with this is that it does take a bit longer to absorb than I would like, but once it sinks in it's perfectly fine. * This is my first time trying these products. I was looking for a sunscreen that would not burn my sensitive skin or my eyes. 

I am 27 with combination skin. This product Is not greasy at all and it lasts all day. I also pair it with the mist for a retouch. * Has a cool and soft touch to the face. I also love the packaging. * This product made my face break out * I have very dry skin to the point it hurts sometimes, and I'm very particular about always wearing sunscreen on my face; I love this moisturizer/sunscreen! It really hydrates my skin, protects from the sun, and doesnt make me breakout either! I really enjoy the way it dispenses because it helps me to not use too much/too little of the product. * I have very dry skin and this stuff works its magic! Worth the price in my opinion. One jar lasted me a couple of months using it daily"

This I used for a month and I feel my skin looked more plumper. It stays all day works great under your makeup.No smell also leaves no residue behind. Sinks into your skin very fast. I definitely recommend this. The price is great for this big of bottle. * I received this product as part of a #pinchme free trial and am happy I did. I have combination skin but dry more often than now. Also starting to develop fine lines. This creme not only made my skin feel smooth and hydrated, but also looks more radiant. * While I received a free product from RoC, I definitely am not being compensated for this and wanted to share that I did love the product. The retinol correction max daily feels amazinng on my skin and my skin overall feels softer and more supple after using it for a month. I didn't notice any changes the first 2 weeks but after a full month, I am loving how my skin is feeling. * The texture was good. The smell was not strong, but I like it. The effect was excellent! My skin is dry. I could feel it affected on my skin only one day. I highly recommend it!!! * I have been using this for over a month now and my skin is so much softer and brighter… I love the hydration it provides to my skin.. I apply it mostly at nights and make sure to apply spf in the morning. * I really enjoy the texture of this creme, and I love how it has left my skin both feeling and looking. I have hard water, and my skin has been really showing it lately. This has helped a lot. I've had no irritation, and found no noticeable scent which usually bother me. I highly recommend, feels worth the price to me where many others haven't. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. * I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I have dry skin and I am in my mid 30's. I used this for a few weeks morning and night, a long with my usual products. My skin was softer, fine lines less pronounced as well! The retinol had my dry skin glowing with cell turnover. I wore this under makeup with no issues (with and without primer)."

Even under my concealer/foundation (which is medium coverage) there was a visible orange tint to my skin making it look like I had a bad self-tanner on my face. 

I could see it *maybe* working for medium-to-dark skinned, warm undertone people, but it's definitely not for those who are closer to the ""porcelain"" or cool undertone categories. * I use this product everyday, either mixing it in with my skin tint for more color correction or by itself. It corrects all my redness from my rosacea and any breakouts. Couldn't recommend this product enough, its amazing. * I use this product everyday, either mixing it in with my skin tint for more color correction or by itself.

It does the trick of helping your natural skin look even and moisturized. Highly recommend! * This product does cover my redness, it has enough coverage to be worn alone or under foundation. Do be careful not to work it too much or it will turn orange."

This is dewy and hydrating without breaking me out. My skin is less red and smoother after using this. Love it! * I absolutely love this moisturizer! It's light & feels very hydrating. I love the dewy finish on my skin, but I wouldn't recommend for oily girls. This has Propolis at the very top of the ingredient list, so you know you're getting all the benefits for an affordable price. Not to mention it's fragrance free! I pair this with a peptide eye cream & it has diminished my fine lines * In lieu of my 5 star rating, this product sadly ended up in my ""can't use"" category. I absolutely loved EVERYTHING about the whole Propolis line, but unforturnately Propolis is an allergen tested during an allergy patch test and mine showed a trace reaction which my allergist informed me to avoid any allergens even if it is only a trace. This could be an issue for people who have sensitive skin. I have to say that other than being a possible irritant or allergy to some, this moisturizer is a really great consistency and lives up to all the expectations that it claims to have. As with any product that is new to your skin, proceed with caution and do a patch test. Its worth knowing :) * I love the toner and serum in this line but for whatever reason this lotion is just waaay too much for me. It would irritate my exzema and cause small/minor breakouts. I have dry/reactive/acne prone skin so moisturizers are a challenge for me * My skin loves it! My pores look smooth, its calming & hydrating without looking greasy. A little goes a long way. * I LOVE THIS! My skin took around a week to really settle into this as my face reacts to new things. However once i got into the routine of using this, my pores look smooth, my skin is plump, and is overall hydrating without looking greasy. It also calms down the redness I have on my cheeks. A little goes a long way. I finally found a moisturizer that works for me."

Dang, that's all I remember of pi. Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore... * I got this as a sample, and it is the best moisturizer I've ever tried. I do not need a lot, and it goes on easily. I don't feel like my skin is greasy after using Kopari Moisturize Whipped Ceramide Cream. I normally have skin that feels dry and tight * I am so glad I blind bought this moisturizer! I have gone through 2 of these containers and will con t inue to purchase. If you have dry, dehydrated, or sensitive skin YOU MUST TRY IT! * I love Kopari products and really wanted to love this face cream. I have dry to normal skin. It was not emollient enough for my liking and did nothing to enhance my skin. It did not leave my skin softer or nourished after applying it. It not worth the cost. If you are looking for superior hydration, this cream is not it! I saw no benefits whatsoever to my facial skin after using it. * This moisturizer is amazing! I wake up to the most glowing, softest skin ever! It's quite concentrated though, so a little goes a long way. There's no discernible smell. I definitely recommend."

I use it daily as my skin prep before makeup. It keeps my skin so hydrated under foundation!! * This is perfect to moisturize the skin before applying makeup. Leaves your skin glowing and hydrated before foundation * This is the key to flawless makeup! I've used countless moisturizers and primers, and have never been quite happy with how my makeup blended on top. I wish I would have tried this sooner, but it was worth the wait. I have combo skin, and this is so smooth and hydrating, but not heavy or greasy. The smoothness is what makes me love how my foundation blends on top. I like a matte finish foundation, but they tend to be too drying and look dry on my skin. Not anymore! I get the smoothest, most plush looking effect from this moisturizer and my makeup looks better than ever! I highly recommend this! * True to explain, stays on, I see the difference in my skin. * I have noticed a HUGE difference in fine lines! Im 29 and constantly asked if im 22! * Used this product for 4 days, my entire face and neck broke out in a rash. I do not recommend this product to anyone that has sensitive skin."

It keeps breakouts at bay while brightening my skin. NO PILLING. :) * So clean and light, it absorbs so well without fully disappearing. Leaves skin feeling clean and not greasy . * Probably one of the beat skincare products I've ever used. Wish I could afford to keep it in stock. * This eye gel is part of my every day beauty routine. A little goes a long way. It's very soothing and moisturizing. It does not settle in pores and it does not pill. I use it before I put on my tinted moisturizer. * Refreshing light citrus scent, cool on the skin, moisturizes without feeling heavy or greasy. * I was looking for cheaper dupe to the 100hr moisture surge from clinique and this was the only other moisturizer that has caffine in it. But the smell was too strong. Says theres essential oil inside but i never break out but i did. Go pay the extra 10 or get moisturizer surge. Also blackfriday and other holidays it goes on sale * I received a sample of this product in a big sample kit and decided to try it out. I had been using The Ordinary Niacinamide + Zinc for the longest time and after trying out the sample there is no going back for me. I had no idea but The Ordinary was causing breakouts which cleared up in a matter of days once switching to this. It makes my skin feel refreshed almost immediately and my skin looks brighter and plumper after just 30 minutes. Normally heavily fragrant products make me break out and cause my face to burn due to my sensitive skin but I have not had this issue at all with this product. It is a refreshing citrus smell which I absolutely LOVE the smell of citrus. After long time use my skin consistently looked brighter and I had less dry skin and fine lines. It is true that it does leave your skin feeling sticky but I always put my moisturizer on top of it and the stickiness is no longer an issue. I highly recommend this product!!"

If you are used to unscented products, you will not mind the smell at all. So happy I found this and Peach and Lily! * I bought this in combination with the relief serum to see if it will help with my mild redness. I am not seeing much difference after about six weeks. I also feel like my skin is even dryer than when I started. I will try out their hydration specific products instead to see if I can get the desired results. I also can't belive how small the package is for the price. I almost thought it was travel size. * I dont mind smell but this smells like cardboard and STRONG! * I have super reactive, sensitive skin. I was having a flare up from something and was getting desperate. I came across this moisturizer online when I remembered that I had a sample of this from a previous order. I figured my face is already freaking out so if it doesn't work it won't be much worse.. The sample is small but even after using just a little bit I could tell my face was starting to calm down. By the end of the day, I had ordered the full size and another P&L product lol. I don't know if I will use this everyday or just when my skin is freaking out on me but I am so grateful for this product! Anything that helps me get my face to calm down is a winner in my book. I am absolutely miserable when I get those flare-ups and in about 24 hours I am feeling much more comfortable and normal. Hopefully this continues to be a winning product for me. Oh and yes, there is a play doughy smell but it is not bad at all! It goes away very quickly. Frankly, if you care about the smell I don't think your skin needs this enough. I'd slather my face in dead fish to get my face to feel better when it's reactive and angry if that were the solution lol. * This cream does feel soothing and comforting to my skin that has been ravaged by the dry cold winter air. It does not smell nice but thats not a deal breaker for me because other natural products kindof have a similar smell. This cream does not play nice with liquid foundation so I only use it on no makeup days. * I am very sensitive to fragrance in my face products so I'm used to the way fragrance free products smell but this is a bit much.  The cream is really good though. I just wish the moisturizers from this brand came in tubes instead of jars but thats just me. * I really this moisturizer but I can't get passed the smell. It's hard to explain, almost like a earthy or new paper or cardboard smell. It's strong enough to constantly smell it, even after wearing for hours. It becomes overwhelming. It's the only reason I'm rating it one star. I won't be able to wear it because I can't get passed the smell."

For referance i used to use the neutrogena hydroboost moisturizer haha this stuff is 10x better. Although it is a bit pricey I think its totally worth it. My skin glows like no other! I dont wear makeup so its important for my skin to be on 10 at all times. I also have combo skin and it doesnt make me feel oily or anything. Lastly, I bought the bottle at the beginning of April and its now Sept and ill probably buy another by the end of this month.. so the money goes a long way!! * I enjoyed using the product, the packaging is really good. It has a really nice smell without being strong. The only thing I don't like is that it's a bit pricey for the quantity. * They changed the formula and the smell is completely different. I used to love this product because it smelled like a spa. The new formula also does not feel as rich on the skin. This will be my last bottle. Too pricey and it is near impossible to get the last 1/4 of the product out of the jar, * I purchased this cream and overnight cream for my face along with the body lotion ..WELL
They all smell the same overnight and Day facial cream is the same to me 
I spent over $100.00 on two facial products are the same .
won't buy it again * Lightweight, smells great and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. * Ok seriously Ive tried thousands of products over the yeara because i have sensitive ans acne prone skin! Ive been using this every day sometimes twice a day if i rememebr and its kept my skin CLEAR!!

I also like how quickly absorbs into the skin and doesn't have yhat greasy feel after on the tace.  I typically layer this with serums.  I tried it in the colder dry months and makes my skin feel  hydrated. * I had been use this product over 20 years 
It worked very good on my skin. * This is marketed for normal-dry skin but I have combo-oily and my skin drinks this! Also not marketed for my age range (20s), but if you're looking to splurge, this is it! I bought it on a whim as a Beauty Steal and I would absolutely buy it again. It's super hydrating but lightweight, not greasy, great for sensitive skin, and leaves me with a healthy glow! This moisturizer has helped to smooth my skin especially as I'm dealing with breakouts - gives me better glass skin than some Asian beauty products that claim to do so. Love love love! * A light moisturizer that delivers maximum hydration.  I have always had good results from Clarins products."

I got a sample of this cream ans love how my skin feels ans looks when i use it. The price is exorbitant and is the only thing keeping me from making it my usual night cream (i work in retail so it takea half a shift to pay for it). I'll jusy have to watch for sales! * I bought the collagen cream to replace collagen masks. I am very pleased with the results after just a few days. After cleansing and toning, I massage a small amount into my skin. I allow it to dry completly and then use Philosohy Miracle Worker face cream over top of it. This gives me smooth, glass skin all day. My skin texture has markedly improved since adding the collagen cream. It is key to properly massage the collagen cream in and letting it dry before adding the second cream. I do not wear makeup, so I cannot speak to how it would layer. * I was really excited to try this and after a few weeks notice no results. * Leaves my skin soft. Will repurchase * I blend this with the  prayer Thomas water drench sheet tint moisturizer. Blends great! Firms my skin and doesn't feel greasy or heavy.  I use this as a foundation.  Quite  expensive for the combo… but it works great with make up or just as a tinted moisturizer with mascara. * This is a great product and feels good on my skin, but I can't use it like other moisture products before applying my foundation because of pilling.. I now use only at night so I'm not putting anything over it. * I like it. I also drink collagen supplements so i think it works pretty well on top if it. Im only 23 so i dont have wrinkles to begin with but i will say that its pretty sticky going on and if you touch your face while its trying to dry than you will get the 'beads' like everyone else is saying but if you dont touch your face until its fully dry it will look normal"

Wish they'd reformulate it so I could go back to using it again. * I personally wasn't a fan of this product. First I want to point out the sales associates at Ulta are super sexist to men and I got passed multiple times every time I asked for help literally ignored me. But back to this product, it's very similar to sun screen I prefer a thicker face lotion like the 2-1 face & beard but that got discontinued. * After years of using Vasaline Intensive Care lotion on his face, I convinced him to try the Clinique For Men Broad Spectrum SPF21 Moisturizer.  He loved it!  For a lotion with sun scree, it's not greasy and  it absorbs into the skin nicely leaving no residue. * If you've ever had a reaction to a sunscreen this one probably contains your culprit. Wore once and broke out in a rash/hives where it was applied. I will now be avoiding oxybenzone. * Applied it at the store to test it out and also bought some, a few hours later had a giant bump on my chin. Going to rerun it tomorrow. * This is the only product my husband doesn't seem to have a skin reaction to. He has oily, sensitive skin. * My husband, who usually hates skin care products, is obsessed with this Clinique moisturizer. I paired this one with the anti-age moisturizer in the Clinique line and he's noticed a huge difference in his skin tone."

I have a light case of KP and have skin that can be sensitive to select scents. I actually like that there is no scent in this product (maybe a light, clean scent) because I can make my perfume the star of the show right after a shower.

My only complaint is when you get to the bottom of the product, it is difficult to get the remaining product out. However, I wanted to milk my money, so for the last few weeks of using this lotion, I was banging it on a table to get every bit out.

I will always recommend using this product * I'm not sure why this happened if my skin is really good with salicylic acid in fact it prefers it then benzyl peroxide so I decided to try this out. I put it on overnight after my moisturizer as much as my pointer finger and I woke up the next day, my breakouts worse so I just stopped using it right then and there kind of disappointed was hoping for good results.🥺 * I love how it feels on my skin and i think it would add hydration to my skin. * My daughter tried the face wash and this gel and her face had a terrible reaction. No, no new foods or other items. She immediately began burning. Her face is like this on both sides and she has never had sensitive reaction to any other product. * I have dry, but clear skin. However, summertime + makeup = sweaty breakouts. So to stay on top of it, I started using this product once daily during my nighttime routine. Started working in just a few days of use. Now, instead of having several problem areas after a full day of wearing a full face of  makeup and sweating, I maybe have just small baby blemish that resolves itself overnight. It also does not dry out my skin more than it already is, if anything my skin has been feeling softer and more hydrated. I use La Roche Posay double repair moisturizer and it works well alongside it. With how well this has worked for me, I'm excited to try more products from them. Highly recommend! * i love this brand so much i've literally never been disappointed with any of their stuff but my makeup grips onto this like the hydro grip primer i am in love!! I've always had issues with layering and pilling no matter what i changed before but this product is crazy good and makes it easy, here to repurchase AGAIN. please good molecules never stop making this product and just try it especially if u have oily or combo skin"

My face is naturally a little red and this does help tone it down a bit. It absorbs well and doesn't pill when mixed with other skincare or makeup. * This has helped with my rosacea and my dryness on my chin and face in general doesn't feel oily or sticky, feels very light on my face! * i have sensitive skin and struggle with some redness so i bought this product. it caused a real bad reaction, my face flared up in splotches and it burned for a few hours * My skin gets better and better (and less red). I also use Burt's Bees facial oil (oil first, then cream). And I added a cold rinse when I'm done cleansing my face or in the shower. I'm so pleased with the results. The weight of this cream is just right - my skin feels healthy but not greasy or heavy. * Disclaimer: I do not use this for the redness relief 
This is by far the only moisturizer that has worked for me and my dry skin. I couldn't justify getting it again after the first time despite it working because of the price but after spending probably even more money trying to find another moisturizer that works for me I realized nothing works like this does. It actually obsorbs into my skin and leaves it hydrated unlike other moisturizers where they go on and my skin still feels dry no matter what. It makes my face look glowy and dewy and I love that feeling so much bc I don't even have to use a lot either! But I feel like it is a bit expensive for how little you get but I'm willing to look past that since this is the only thing working for me. * I have sensitive skin and I struggle with eczema flair ups around my face and eyes. I bought this during one of my worst flair ups. This, with the matching cleanser, single handedly balanced my skin back to normal. This is a very nourishing, light weight moisturizer that feels so calming and soothing on my skin and helps reduce my redness. I will say I get the best results if I double moisturize with this product. I have tried switching up my skincare since I first started this product and everytime I get a flair up. Once I start using this moisturizer and the cleanser again, my skin resets back to normal. This also layers nicely under makeup and is nonburning on eczema patches. I love this product and cant recommend it more. * I have oily, acne prone skin. So I deal with a lot of redness when I do break out. This cream is great to soothe that redness. I put on very little in the morning, but I put on a little bit more for overnight. This goes on after I wash, use Hero Post Blemish Rescue Balm, Tallow & Honey Moisturizer, and before I spritz on some ITK Blemish Treatment Mist. Definitely works for my routine!"

Sits well under my foundation and doesn't pill or leave white marks. * The formula is so dense it feels heavy on the skin. I know it's a mineral sunscreen but it leaves such a noticeable white cast. Don't even think about putting other products under because every single one I've tried has pilled off when I go to rub it in * I have very sensitive skin, vanicream is the only brand I have found that doesn't cause a breakout or dry out my  very dry skin. the only con I have for this SPF is it is really oily the first 30ish minutes after applying, even on my very dry skin. I would purchase again though due to being the only product that hasn't caused a breakout or dried out my skin. I love that it is 100% mineral sunscreen as I am allergic to chemical ones. * it was very oily on my skin, left a white cast, and when i put makeup on top of it it made it very patchy * I wanted to love for the spf + moisturizer but it left my skin feeling sticky. I have dry skin. It felt like my skin wasn't absorbing it. It felt like no mather how mucb you rub it in it wont absorb. It also has a white cast, I usually never minded it but with this one I did. * My dermatologist gave me a sample of this and I fell in love with it. It makes my skin so soft. I was excited when I found that Ulta carries it! * It can be a better product. Brand claims to be for sensitive skin but this product needs a new formula. Eyelids need sunscreen too so I put on a small amount (smaller than a dime) and after about 10 mins my eyes get watery. White cast for me is manageable but for how this brand perceives to be great but not really"

I have very dry and mature skin and generally need a very thick moisturizer so, thus one surprised me!  It's super light, absorbs very quickly and keeps my skin moisturized all night. * One of the best moisturizers ive used and ive used quite a few.

I usually go barefaced but I like to do eye makeup sometimes, and enjoy a good base, but foundation sucks on me, separating and drying the skin. I use this sparingly, tapping on only certain areas with redness, and it works great. I blend it out, and because I'm a bit more fair than the hint of olive I might dab a bit of foundation in a couple spots, and it looks great. compared to other green products 3 times the price, I prefer this. the other ones always have dried me out and sank into pores/lines, looking chalky, but when I wear this I look moisturized and alive. * Figured this would be a good option for when going to the gym or small errands but it's just not good. It leaves my face feeling greasy/oily plus it barely covered my redness. * This product does NOT want to blend! I shook it up, down, left and right and it was still separated. It actually sounded like I was shaking a water bottle. Only oily water came out and a smidge of tinted product. I an medium neutral skintone with crazy, beet red rosacea and blemishes. This didnt cover anything. I wasn't expecting a miracle but I was hoping for at least a *slight* reduction in redness, but it didnt even do that. If you want zero improvement on your skin with a greasy slick feeling, use this. * The directions instruct you to shake the product, and after doing so, a clear liquid came out that smelled like rubbing alcohol. I gave it a second try and thick textured beige cream came out that irritated my skin."

Taking it back * but, unfortunately I don't. I have really oily skin & thought the gel texture would be great for me. -I DO like that, but after using this every morning for a week my skin started to break out a little. I kept using for another week to see if my skin was just purging. I'm still have the breakouts. I normally don't have that happen with other facial moisturizers I've used. I don't have sensitive skin. Sad, but I am returning this product and going back to my regular moisturizer. * I don't have sensitive skin. I use Vitamin C on my skin on a regular basis & layer several serums under moisturizers. This product instantly burned my skin which was something I had never experienced. Tried again this morning & had to wash it off. * It's great. * Sadly was not for me, burning sensation instsntly. Needed to wssh my face and back to my normal hydrating serums and moisturizers. 
Item was returned * This product (I didn't use anything else in my skincare routine) made my skin super irritated, inflamed, red, sensitive, covered in bumps, and itchy, like I've never seen before. My eyelids are also very swollen & it's hard to see. It's been a few days and my face still looks scary and burns every time I wash it and try to put any fragrance free lotion on. Not sure what ingredient in this product I am allergic to. I have used many (stronger) vitamin C products over the years and had never had any issues. I do enjoy other products from this brand though."

I use Olay sensitive during the winter months and usually add Neutrogena SPF, but I found this product this spring and decided to try it. I absolutely love. I use serum first and then this. I absorbs nicely and doesn't leave my skin sticky. I use under my eyes and my eye lids and I do not experience any burning. I occasionally use powder foundation and it holds all day. the scent is nice and not over powering like other products. * Wanted to love this product however it burns my eyes!! * Great product. * I can only put this on about half of my face because of how incredibly badly it makes my eyes sting. Even if I take care to avoid the eye area, it creeps in them somehow. Feels nice as a moisturizer but it makes me look more sweaty/oil slick than glowy. Have to completely cover my face with setting powder for my skin to not look wet. * this product provided a good moisturizer for my skin but it left my skin oily. I used it with a hydrating serum after but I also used the moisturizer by itself and it still made my skin oily. It made my face smell like sunscreen but it helped with an initial layer of sun protection. If it wasn't so oily I would like this product."

Need to use a very little amount to get the job done! Not greater clogging at all! * 👍👌 * I absolutely love this cream! It's kinda pricey especially for such a small container but overall it works great :) * This product is not magic. It's an OK moisturizer. Doesn't really have any pleasant or offensive smell. May have made my face slightly softer, I didn't notice any improvement and wrinkles. My main issue is the cost and also the travel sized container would require you to bring Q-tips or an applicator with you. You can't fit even a finger into the tiny opening to get the product out. Will use what I have, but wouldn't buy again. * I wouldn't buy again- it was super annoying because of the pilling. * I was looking forward to try this product. The sales associate said product was great!! Well, 2 jars down and still waiting for something. I'm very savvy about my facial products, but this didn't show anything. This is just my opinion for myself. Hopefully someone else will have better results."

I trusted them as an early brand for clean beauty, when that category was much (much) smaller. While this product smelled amazing, and soaked in great...I started breaking out. I couldn't figure it out for a week!

Not only are octyl salicylate and octocrylene not reef safe, but they also break me out terribly with what feels more like a burn. Stay away, if not for yourself - for the environment. * I was very excited to find a daily moisturizer with the bonus of having sun protection. However, I don't want to smell like I'm going to the beach at work (or anywhere else for that matter). It's kinda heavy and makes your eyes water from burning. * I absolutely love this moisturizer!! It is a bit greasy but if u have dry skin this is my go to. I love the subtle smell too! I would recommend this. Just don't get it near your eyes if possible. It will burn ur eyes * it's a bit greasy even after soaking into my normal skin, and has been causing me to break out. It smells amazing and feels nice, but I really miss the Sea &C magnifying primer that was discontinued. The finish was better and didn't make me break out at all. * I don't know why I thought that maybe this time regular American chemical sunscreen actives wouldn't burn the crap out of my face. This product irritated my skin really bad. I bought the whole line and had such bad breakouts and dry skin that it took at least two months to regain even a semblance of normal skin and I only used the line for at best two weeks (but the sunscreen was only once on the face). I was using this on my chest as sunscreen until I started breaking out there too. I have had a bad reaction to nearly all of Pacifica's products and I think I'm done even trying. * The moisturizer works great and smells amazing. However, it's not the best for oily skin. I have combination oil skin and my skin gets very, very oily with this after a few hours. I gave it 4 stars just for that reason. If you have normal or dry skin, I think this would work better."

Also love that its refillable. * Leaves my face feeling hydrated and plumped and smooth * I rarely get irritated skin from a skincare product, but this cream irritated my face so badly. After applying in the morning, by nighttime, my skin was red, itchy, and breaking out. Over the next few days. my face was super dry and peeling. Not sure which ingredient was the cause but this cream was disappointing, had to return. * This product make my skin soft and smooth, only little bit is enough for the skin * Really love how this isnt greasy or sticky. The scent is nice. My makeup looked so good over it w a primer, but I'd prefer it had a sunBLOCK. SPF 40, at least. I feel naked w/out more sun protection.

207,avÃ¨ne,tolerance control skin recovery balm,pimprod2026570,2586856," * I tried this product for 2 weeks and I now have dry flaky skin on my cheeks and nose. I bought this product because I have sensitive skin that gets a little drier in the winter months, but my skin has never been this dry in my life! 
Pros: it dries quickly and applys nice under makeup. Not greasy. 
Cons: dried up my skin into a flaky mess. * Since I have hypothyroidism, my skin was always super dry and I would have a lot of rashes as a result. But, this lotion is sensitive enough not to irritate my skin furthermore and durable enough to lock in moisture to eliminate dryness without clogging up my pores. Happy i came across this brand because I have wasted a lot of money before finding this product. * Please never remove this. It's the only moisturizer I've ever been able to use without triggering my acne!! I never have any product related breakouts anymore!! Finding a good moisturizer that worked for my skin was soo hard. This is so perfect and I've been using it for probably a year now. * I use retinol and aha products regularly so every now and then my skin peels and gets red and sensitive. I have tried a lot of soothing and calming products on the market to fix my occasionally irritated skin but so far this one is the only one that doesn't hurt when applied and that actually calms my skin down. I have used both its cream and balm version. They are both great but I like the balm one a little better. * Glides onto the skin nicely and leaves a nice hydrated finish to the skin. Very soothing for dryness without clogging pores * In recent years i've developed excema on my eyelids, chin & ear lobes. I've tried so many moisturizers that claim to help reduce redness and lock in moisture, but it wasn't until I found this product that my skin changed for the better. I bought the 3 pack sample with the facewash and thermal water and fell in love with all. 

First purchased back in September 2022 & still using the same 3 products today. I even tried to change back to some old products that used to work for me and my skin returned to the brittle and scaly old self that used to be. I remain consistent with this brand, and they have shown me love back, my skin soaks this stuff in and doesnt break me out whatsoever. 

Super gentle and refreshing. One of my favorite pros is that it leaves my irritated and stinging skin, smooth and calm. if you have irritated skin that stings, even when you put your moisturizer on it, this product is definitely for you and will help with that sensation. * This is my favorite Avene product! So much that I finished my first tube and bought two more! It has been very helpful for my dry face this winter and I love using it at night over my serums."

Staple in my routine now ! * I have tried many moisterizers and overnight moisturizers and THIS one is beat smelling best smoothing lifting brightening and cost efficient product with no bad reactions on my skin! No burn just smooth texture all day. I love this because most give me hwasaches the second i out them on becausebof fragrance but this smells sooo good without any pain to my eyes or head! I can't recommend enough, will be repurchasing! I bought when it was on thanksgiving sale! * PUR's Get A Lift moisturizer has become a staple in my beauty routine! I've been using it for a year and have purchased it three times now. I've only ever bought it when it's on sale, but I honestly think even at full price it would be worth it! I'm 34 with combo skin, leaning more towards oily. My skin is also flaking and peeling right now due to my prescription skincare treatment and the cold weather. This moisturizer does an excellent job keeping my skin hydrated without pilling or weighing it down, and it keeps the peeling down to a minimum, if any! Once it's absorbed, my skin looks nice and dewy instead of greasy, and I've seen improvement in both softness and texture of my skin. It does burn occasionally if I have patches that are particularly red/irritated, but the burning stops quickly and there's no irritation afterwards. The scent is light, sort of citrusy, and it doesn't linger. I use it every evening and one jar lasts me about 4-5 months. Overall I highly recommend this moisturizer! * This facial cream feels great on my skin. I use it daily to help with loss of elasticity and firmness, especially around the jawline. I really do think it's helped my 60+  yr. old skin. * This moisturizer feels amazing on my skin and so luxurious. I would buy again! * I bought this during black Friday sales and biggest regret was not buying more while on discount.

The formula feels amazing in my skin, it literally feels so luxe. And there is noticeable difference to my skin. I'm actually obsessed!"

I reordered it on sale last week at the age of 25 and it is still so amazing, but not hydrating enough for me anymore. I love the smell, its super light but lingers in the best way. I will still use it and probably reorder but will be prepping with a heavier moisturizer before applying this under makeup. I also really love it for a no makeup makeup day because it just seems to make my skin even and glowy. * I just turned 44 and am feeling it. I purchased a bag of new products including this moisturizer on the recommendation of 2 employees. I wore it for the first time on Thursday with mascara and eyeshadow. A female coworker told me, ""I hope that this doesn't get me into trouble, but your face looks so good. You have the natural glow of someone that just had a good time."" So needless to say I will wear this every day for the rest of my life. * My skin isn't the most sensitive, but it does have random triggers that cause redness and irritation. My face broke out in red irritated blotches, especially near my eyebrows. Love FAB, but this one ain't for me :("

It makes my skin feel good also! * love the way its not to heavy or over moisturizing just the right moisturizer for my combination skin. * This is awesome for aging skin ! * I have been using No 7 products for years, and my skin thanks me. * I have sensitive skin and so far is been really good. My skin feels smooth and fresh I recommend it. * Not as moisturizing as I would have wanted. My skin felt dry soon afterwards. Perhaps there is too much water in the formula which evaporates quickly. I prefer a slightly richer formula to nourish my skin. * I am in my late 20's and I notice my forehead was starting to have deep wrinkles and my neck was starting to form unappealing wrinkles. I tried this product out. After week, I definitely notice the difference on my forehead. The lines got softer. Definitely recommend trying the product out and add it to your skin routine."

Don't expect it to completely remove dark spots, however. I recommend an entire skin care regimen that will assist you with balanced, even skin tone. * This feels hydrating and great. I've already noticed changes and will continue to use Tula! * I love this moisturizer. I have sensitive skin that becomes dry and dull in the winter. The moisturizer does not irritate my skin and keeps my skin moisturized all day long. It smells great too! * 1.7 oz of product which will last you barely a month. for the price it is not worth it. * The product is okay, but not worth the cost. I am appalled at how little product is in this HUGE jar. The exorbitant cost does not equate to how little product you actually receive. Save the planet, reduce plastic.

I will not be purchasing again. * Shocked as to how little of product waa in that jar! Tula do better! That jar wasnt even half full. So disappointing."

I have tried so many that leave your under eyes looking cakey or dry, or too hydrating where it becomes oily or sticky.  This perfectly absorbs into the skin and leaves the under eyes feeling hydrated and smooth.

And after  using other eczema creams I will come back to this and repurchase the product. It absorbs well and fast, and it doesn't feel heavy. It feels smooth and it is very hydrating for those lingering super dry eczema spots. * My face suddenly became red and began burning and peeling.  I used this cream and it cleared up overnight!  I now use it every night and morning.  Like a miracle! * I have recently been dealing with dry patches on my face, especially around my nose, eyebrows snd chin. It was causing my face to feel extremely greasy, yet dry at the same time. When i would shower there would always be an insane amount of dead skin, and after using my regular products in my skincare routine my face was not feeling hydrated at all. I picked this up after doing some research and after one use my skin feels plump and hydrated! I have extremely fair and sensitive skin with alot of redness on my face and this product did not itritate my skin in the slightest. I applied after using La Roche Posay's gentle face wash for normal to oily skin and the difference I feel after this combo is insane. A little product goes a long way, as it is a little thik when cominb out of the tube but this is my new go to moisturizer! * I have been suffering from eczema for a while now and I didn't want to use my prescription anymore or cortisone lotions. I wanted to use something a bit more natural. This helps with itching, redness and bumps. It's moisturzing as well. I really love using this lotion and I wish I had found this sooner. * I have very severe eczema and I have tried everything for my face rash. This cleared up the redness in 1-2 days and it also is helping clear up the flakiness on my face. I use it on my body too and it helps and feels very nourishing. * I have psoriasis and eczema and I have tried all kinda lotions. None of them seemed to have helped but I came across this and gave it a try. 

My skin was instantly moisturized and it dulled the redness even the reduced flakiness by alot. I'm impressed and am so excited that I've finally found something that actually works. * My daughters ezcema started getting bad again and we tried this for the first time and it worked !! The itch went away the first day and the rash started getting bettwr the second day !"

I find my skin is oily and tight half way through the day. It is cooling on the skin and decent under a tinted moisturizer. * This product has helped my oiliness slightly, and did not irritate the sensitive areas on my face, and doesn't burn when applying. It soaks in quickly, and my skin feels refreshed afterward. I don't see why I wouldn't continue to use this product. There is no scent, which I appreciate. * I liked. * I have had trouble finding a good go-to lotion thats not greasy, and this is amazing. I use it everyday AM and PM, and it leaves my face feeling so smooth and clean without the feeling of a heavy moisturizer. I would compare this to the belif aqua bomb, just even more lightweight. * I have sensitive skin so I was scared to try a new moisturizer. I did break out a little bit the first week (around the chin area) but after using for 2 weeks, my skin is in love !!! Super moisturizing and my skin feels great * I have very oily acne prone skin and it works very well. Not greasy at all, althpugh it is a gel. It goes on smooth and i love it.

Really happy they have it in a kit. * I am a die hard PTR fan at this point! This moisturizer is soooo nice and lithtweight but ultra hydrating, leaving 0 greasiness! Highly recommend!
And I love using the eye masks in the morning as I get ready for the day; it perks your skin and eyes right up! * The eye patches didn't do anything for the dark circles under my eyes and the moisturizer wasn't enough for the desert climate that I live in. * One of my favorite moisturizers. My eyes are very sensitive and many moisturizers, and serums cause them to burn if I use them around my face. Not these and I love the moisturizer for morning and night. * My skin is always dry even after trying other moisturizers the next day its super dry.

With the larger amount I was using I didn't find it very hydrating and my face felt tight. It also left a white cast and was a little streaky. The absolute deal breaker was the burning in my eyes. I cannot open my eyes at all with how bad it is. Even after washing my face the burning sensation won't go away. A waste of money and a lot of tears. * I love the original Ultra Repair Moisturizer so I bought this one hoping it would be the same. I found it  hard to rub into my skin. It felt like it just sat on top of my skin. It also burned my eyes. Even when I'm careful not to get it anywhere near my eyes I end up tearing up pretty bad. * This burned my eyes horribly. * Feels amazing * Feels amazing * Not moisturizing at all and leaves white cast * I bought because I have dry skin.

222,peter thomas roth,potent c brightening vitamin c moisturizer,pimprod2039378,2609607," * I would use this even if it didn't contain Vitamin C because it is so moisturizing; it is like a layer of protective cushion for your skin. The fact it contains the stable form of Vitamin C that most dermatologists prefer to recommend is of course THE reason to use it. I also LOVE that they didn't add fragrance to mask the  normal smell of the vitamin C ingredient. Yes, that odd ""hot dog?"" scent is just what the vitamin C smells like, and it dissipates in less than a minute. * Bought this product about a month ago, I was worried at first about spending so much money, but it was time to drop the dime. I'll be turning 35 soon and my skin was dull, dry and sometimes had red patches that would burn when using other creams, correctors and moisturizers. 
Since using this product my skin looks just as young and fresh as it did in my 20's!
I will definitely be purchasing this again when I run out. * Started using this product about a month ago and I love how dewy and hydrated my skin looks. It has also helped with my skin tone.

That being said, I have very sensitive acne prone skin, and this did not irritate my skin except for around my eyes, and did not leave much white cast. * I have used this moisturizer for YEARS! I suffer from dry skin and all other moisturizers would cause my face to have little white flakes on it. After I started using this it never happened again. * I was given this as a gift and at first i didnt know it was a sunscreen and used it for a while as just a moisturizer, eventually I looked this up on the app and only realized then. But overall this product is really good and feels great on my skin, one thing id change it the packaging, after long term use the film on the grey cap came off and i had it all over my hands that ended up on my face after i applied.

Great for dry skin and can use everywhere not just your face. * Started using about a week ago my whole is broken out in little red pimples.  Never had a lotion break me out * I really love this. I'm pretty picky with skin products since I worked in the beauty industry for decades and I'm in my 50s. I loved this so much I tried the triple repair thinking it would be even better for dry skin. Nope. This makes my skin feel and look so much better so I came back to this.  It's a perfect staple for long lasting moisture for face or body.. neck especially. It's nice and thick, has no scent and good for sensitive dry skin. Apply on damp skin! * I use this as my daily face moisturizer and it works great. This is a lotion, not a cream, so it's water based and works well for my oily skin because it absorbs quickly without residue. I like that it doesn't make it worse like other moisturizers (also doesn't cure my oiliness but thats not the point). It's an easy pump to grab in the mornings and has lasted me so long. Happy I found this product. * Loved the triple moisturizer. Trying this one out. Definitely a lighter cream but keeps face soft and smooth. * Every skin is different. The first fee times i used this product i loved it and loved the price. But it ended up ruining my skin, my skin broke out. I now have bunch of red dots on my face.

My skin is an investment and with these products the payoff is amazing! ❤️ * I really wanted to try this based on the great reviews but unfortunately after one use, I'm left with hives and I feel sunburned. There must be an ingredient that I'm allergic to. * I would buy this product again * I'm not sure if the product I got was old, but I was super stoked about trying it.

I will not recommend this product to anyone else, they maybe changed their formula but it is not like it was before. * I have combo skin and am onthe drier side in the winter. Love this cream, been using it as my primary daily moisturizer with several other origins products for almost seven years. I've dabbled in other moisturizers, but nothing ever has the same consistency throughout the day as ky origins regime. I'm hooked!! * I have dry skin. I had high expectations for this product……. It didnt absorb and made my skin look so dry…. It also peeled off. It hust stayed on top of my skin and peeled off once dry. Bad bad bad * I think this product has been causing my skin to break out more than usual and leaving small red spots. I think maybe its just a little too greasy and oily. It does hydrate, but not quite in the right way. If youre in a jam and this is all you have around, its better than no moisturizer, but I wouldnt buy again. The smell is nice, if you like citrus, and it does have a refreshing feeling.

Love how my face feels after applying this. Wake up with my face feeling so hydrated and soft. Would highly recommend. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't break me out. Doesn't have that strong perfume smell either. * I got this as a birthday gift sample. Let me just say this product did not disappoint. I have really dry skin especially in the winter and any other time its combo. I was recently in Canada, and I was so concerned about my makeup flaking because of how dry my skin was and no matter how much moisturizer from Dermalogica or La Roche Posay makeup was still flaking, even with primer. I even bought Mac moisturizer since I used their foundation and it still flaked even worse. I had to order the full size because no moisturizer has done this to my skin. Recommending to all my friends and family. * Honestly i loved the initial feeling if this, the crewm feels thick and cool and as you rub it together it turns kind of into a thinner consistancy. But with my dry, texured compromised skin it burned and felt like a weird slick silicone consistency, and my skin still felt dry. I read thet it has citric acid and lactic acid and that could be the burning? Or im allergic. Either way for something thats called a water barrier hyaluronic moisturizer it did not give that at all. * My skin has never felt so soft and looked so plump after using this morning and  night for a week. * I recieved the small birthday sample of this product and im obsessed! The cream itself feels thick or as if its hoing to be greasy but it absorbs right into your skin making ot feels soft and moisturized. I have been using it everyday 2x a day and my face has never felt or looked better!!! * I love this product! It's so good. I always buy it when it comes on sale. * Got a sample for my birthday and unfortunately its so good I'm buying a full size lol. I have combo skin but this doesnt seem to make my oily areas worse. Its been below 10 degrees where I live and I think this has really helped my skin. After applying you can still feel the hydration, alot of moisturizers make that claim but this is the only one I've tried that actually makes a difference."

Lotion with spf that does not have a white cast on the skin. I love it and gives a great glow to the face * I received this sunscreen after attending their promotional walk for the launch of the product. I noticed the very next day I started getting micro bumps that resembled milia or granulomatous. I stopped wearing make up and switched to a gentle cleanser to see if those were the reasons however I remained applying the sunscreen to obviously help protect my face. To my surprise, my skin was only getting worse. It was starting to burn and itch. I've been allergy tested, and I don't have any. The day I didn't use the sunscreen, my skin condition immediately disappeared, so I went to look at the ingredients list. I don't know if Origins is using the oils from grapefruit, lemon and orange for fragrance purposes, but it does not list anywhere that they have extracted the furanocoumarins. After meeting with my dermatologist, I was advised that the citrus oils used in the sunscreen caused photosensitivity, and burned/ irritated my skin. If you are someone with darker or sensitive skin, I HIGHLY recommend AVOIDING this."

Started using this product again this week remembered why I love this! My face is becoming rehydrated again. The brightness is coming back and my rosacea is subsiding. I do have sensitive skin and this seems to do the trick to balance pH levels. If you have tried other products with no luck, try this product. Not every product fits everyone but this one is definitely worth the try. To me... worth every cent🙏 * 'My daughter is 14 and this product has been great for her acne * I love to try new products so I've experimented with a number of daily moisturizers with SPF like Drunk Elephant and Unseen Sunscreen and always come back to this Murad holy grail. It doesn't leave a white cast, is moisturizing, non-greasy, and doesn't pill under my makeup. I use this daily and a bottle lasts me roughly 4 months. I'm honestly shocked at other reviews saying they broke out as I have acne prone skin and never have but YMMV. * This is a decent sunscreen, rubs in fine and makes my skin soft. However this burns my eyes soooo bad. Obviously I know to not get sunscreen in my eyes, but it doesn't matter how carefully I put it on, my eyes burn. I have very sensitive & dry eyes and it just doesn't work. The Tula one in the yellow bottle, is the one I continue to go back too. * I was very excited to try this but was disappointed to find the results being similar to a drug store brand product not to mention this product caused my skin to break out and become oily. Never had those issues with my skin before starting to use this. Also the product just pours out of the bottle causing you to end up wasting product every time you use it which makes you run out a lot faster than you would expect. * I have heard great things about Murad so I finally decided to treat myself to this moisturizer. I wanted to love it SO bad but my skin has BLOWN UP with acne so bad, it's starting to really get to me. I used to struggle with acne but it had gotten to be almost non-existed until I bought this. At first I thought my pregnancy hormones had caused my flare up, and it could be a contributor, but this is really the only new piece of my skincare regimen and it seems like others have had the same bad experience as me too. Will be throwing it away and buying my old moisturizer. * As always, every experience can be different but I'll tell you mine: I have very sensitive skin , dry to normal, rarely have acne besides the occasional pimple. When I started using this, my face broke out like a crunch bar. TONS of bumps and several pimples. I started a new night cream at the same time so I wasn't sure, but as soon as I stopped using this my face cleared. It was pretty instant, at the end of the day the bumps were the worst and I would wash my face and wake up to no bumps (not what happens with typical acne). If you haven't heard of acne cosmetica, google it that way you can watch out for it with this product or any others.

I wish this worked out. * After having my baby, part of my postpartum recovery included extremely dry skin around my chin and T-zone area. It was SOOOOOO bad. My makeup application was the worst showing patchy skin. I tried so many things to help, including high-end luxurious products, but nothing worked until I tried this for weeks. I saw it changed the texture of my skin that included smoother and moisturized skin. I love it so much, I just bought a second one. The scent is also light. Nothing too crazy. This was good to my sensitive skin. Highly recommend!!!! * This product did make my skin feel feel and look amazing.  However, it also caused acne breakouts that I hadn't experienced in many years.

This cream is sensational. I live in arid dry cold Colorado and this cream is very viscous - like elmers glue! It remains on the skin hours later, sealing in plumping moisture, but NOT occlusive. Great ingredients list, zero fragrance, and wears well under tinted SPF. High shine though - so I use a setting powder over it in some places. Not causing break outs, and lessens the appearance of fine lines. * Glass packaging that in my opinion preserves the product better with excellent ingredients and a texture of a fine cream that absorbs completely into the skin without leaving it oily and contains a soft scent. * I love it let my face rest moisturizer * This is rhe perfect not to heavy moisture but not to light! I gave this to my 3 year old and she absolutely loves it! I bought it a week ago and she alresh needs a new one! But im not even mad because it is so amazing! Eveeyone needs to buy this it is so good! * On the first and only try after putting it on,I felt a burning sensation and left my skin irritated. * I have dry skin and currently living in a dry climate as well. Ive tried the normal magic cream and it has vegetable oil, fragrance, just a lot of junk. Especially when my forehead can get closed comedones and breakouts easily. I took a gamble and bought the mini and fell in loveee!!! I am so dry in some areas i often peel, so i was prepared to give this away or return (i cant do gel or gel creams becuase of my dry skin). But i was so shocked at how hydrating this is and it make my skin so shiny and glowy and layers so beautifully under makeup. As a sensitive skin girly too, fragrance free is so important to me as fragrances can be irritating. Also, CT is certified cruelty free by leaping bunny, as a girl who lovess animals and only shops cruelty free, so important! Ive since bought the water cream set with the full size and mini that's on the way and I can't wait! Just try it!"
237,beautybio,the zenbubble oil-free calming gel cream,pimprod2019384,2572411," * I've purchased this two times now and am loving how light it feels on the skin while being super hydrating for my dry skin. The container pump makes it so easy to apply. * I got this and the eye cream, both burned my eyes and skin. I am sensitive but don't usually break out in a few hours from a product. Also were very sticky long after applying just them and no other products for self testing. * Far from a moisturizer but in fact left my skin super oily. * Hands down the best makeup primer EVER. Its too good. My makeup looks freshly applied all day long. I csnt say enough about it. * I spent alot on this and it did nothing for me. I like how the product is provided. The moisturizer itself caused skin irritation after I used appropriate face cleanser foe skin type. Not for eczema prone or sensitive skin! * The formula is fine—nothing amazing—and there are similar moisturizers at a more affordable pricepoint. I have combo sensitive skin and it didn't irritate my skin. I do really like it when i mix it with my retinol oil at night as it helps dry down the oil faster and keep in the moisture. The packaging is my favorite part with the pump top. When i'm out of this, i'll refill it with my cetaphil night cream. I got it when it was half off but i still think it's too expensive for what it is. * Ive been eyeing this product for a while but was put off by the price. I finally bought it on a whim one day and im absolutely in love! It feels so good on my face and doesnt feel  greasy! My skins appearance has overall improved as well!"
238,dune suncare,the mug guard broad spectrum spf 30,pimprod2039109,2608975," * I like it! It's a small bottle, but, I like it! I think it lives up to it's claim: my face appears to be smoother, feels softer. * Bummer that this is now 5 mL smaller than before but costs exactly the same. * Not great for sensitive skin. I love a milky SPF for layering other products but even with a heavy moisturizer underneath it dried my skin and caused peeling and flaking * I go through sunscreen like its nothing because I tend to burn easily. This one is lightweight and comfortable. I wear it under makeup without any problems like some cause. The only downside is the price for the size youre getting, but otherwise I love this product and will be buying it again. * I love the texture and feel of this sunscreen and it doesn't cause acne for my very sensitive skin. Downside is it goes quickly and the price point is too high. * I have sensitive, dry skin. I'm newer to using sunscreen daily. I researched many brands and this had great reviews, so I bought it hoping for the best. Using it over my serums has helped them work their magic. My dark spots have eased up and my expression lines are less prominent. My skin is more hydrated and plump. I plan to keep using this because ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" and it works perfectly for me! Also, sometimes when I introduce a new product, my skin has a bad reaction (redness, irritation, breakout) and this sunscreen has not caused any negative reactions. * It is not as good as people are saying in the reviews. Yes, it blends out well but it just stays on top of your skin and leaves you with a greasy feeling. Also, for the price… definitely not worth it. I couldnt even finish the whole bottle because it was breaking me out so bad. Some people are saying its good for people with acne prone skin but as someone with acne prone skin, yeah it is not it. I gave it to a relative because i didnt want to be wasteful and even they didnt like it and theyre honestly not that picky with their skincare. Korean sunscreens are the way to go especially if youre acne prone and the prices are a lot more cheaper!"

Love it * My skin feels smooth and moistureized. * This is my night cream ever night.  It works, It does not irritate my skin. What's not to love about that? * I received a sample of this and did wear sunscreen during the day. The first night it went on everything seemed fine. It went on with no problem. The second day I felt a little tight itching? By the third day I started seeing peeling around my nose and my face felt itchy and burny. Not an overwhelming itch but enough to recognize I'm having a bad reaction. Peeling, itching and a slight burning sensation. I didn't use makeup the first two days but when I put makeup on the third day, it went on blotchy and I could see the irritation on my cheeks, mostly below my eye area. I'm Pacific Islander, NC30 and in my 40's, sadly this product is not for me. * Product is usually good. But got a bad batch and felt bad so I didn't bring it back.  Cream is old and had been sitting on the shelf for a while."

I do two layers before going to bed, its so good! I also enjoy the smell as well and its not too overpowering. The price is ok and I enjoyed it more than the Tatcha water cream I tried and its a lot more expensive! * I recommend this product to EVERYBODY. This stuff right here has completely changed my life. I get compliments on my skin all the time since ive started using this in 2022. I will never stop using it!!! * I have used this product every day, twice a day since 2017. I absolutely love it! It is lightweight, dries down smooth, and helps hydrate my oily sensitive skin. I would cry if FAB ever discontinued this product. 1000% would recommend. * This is a great moisturizer super lightweight better for like oily or skin types. But I like it as a quick little water cream to add to whatever else I'm using for the day. Smells delicious and love coconut so for me, this is a must have! * This product is amazing, it's so light weight and smells amazing. Would definitely recommend * i really loved the product and how it made my skin feel but i went thru the whole thing in one month!!! i can't be buying this every month for that price :/ * If you have acne or just skin in general you NEED this is in your life!"

It's nongreasy, unscented formula glides onto the skin smoothly. It's lightweight and is great for morning and night use. I like it so much that I went back to buy more ""good light"" products! * My new go to moisturizer! I have sensitive combo skin and my skin just loves the hydration this leaves all day. My skin feels so soft and healthy after using it. Nice enough in the summer alone but even better for the fall/winter in the midwest over their abc oil. Fragrance free too. * I really like this face cream for the winter. I live in a high desert climate and have combination skin; this isn't great for all year long but in the winter it's perfect especially after a day outside in harsh conditions. Definitely not lightweight and would be too heavy/ oily for someone with oily skin or in a humid climate but it's great when I need it! As a bonus, I love the packaging. It's not my holy grail and it's more expensive for the size than some other creams that do essentially the same thing but it does it's job well! * Im very picky on what i use on my skin, and this is my holy grail!! I just purchased my 4th bottle today. Its thick and will last all night keeping you moisturized. Its light scented as well! The bottle isnt super huge and its a bit pricey but definitely worth it! * This moisturizer is nothing short of amazing! Perfect! I've tried them all. This is rich, thick, and best of all..no scent! This pairs so nicely with the milky toner and my retinol and vitamin C regiment. * This stuff is by far the top budget-friendly cream I have purchased! It rivals the ones that are over $100."

Peter Thomas Roth is the best! * I was skeptical at first, but have noticed less wrinkles under my eyes and my makeup applies smoother * Amazing peptide complex and anti aging results * I splurged on this product as I felt my skin needed just a good moisturizer that locked everything in and protected it. The product is heavier than most but I feel it does a great job of hydrating my skin. The biggest con I have is the blue painted lid on the jar peels and leaves blue fragments of paint in the product, thus it going on my face. My fingertips are physically blue after simply unscrewing the cap. It actually concerns me because you never know what companies are using to manufacture their products. Disappointed with such a high price point. * Ive been using PTR products for 10+ years and my skin shows amazing results from the use of these products over the years.

I agree with others it's a little tacky feeling but subsides fairly quick. That being said I give it 4 stars. My skin after a few days is more hydrated and healthier looking. * As someone who is always looking for the absolute most lightweight possible lotion, this is a great option for keeping winterttime dryness away without feeling weighted down. Otherwise, it would be a little bit too heavy for my personal taste during warmer months. * As someone who is always looking for the absolute most lightweight possible lotion, this is a great option for keeping winterttime dryness away without feeling weighted down.

I use this with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide or salicylic acid and it pairs well with all my serums and sunscreen. This is also great under makeup since it's not oily and helps makeup last longer. I've repurchased this moisturizer at least 4 times and I always have a backup! * I love that this moisturizer is buildable. You xan relaly control how much you need. It feels great on my skin and my skin is noticeably more plump. I love it! * I am acne-prone but need a moisturizer for skin dryness, especially during the winter when the cold wind easily dries out your skin. After using this moisturizer, I have had several instances of bad luck with getting a new pimple the next morning. The texture and application (no burning) of this product are fine. It does its job to moisturize the skin. However, not without suffering more blemishes sadly. I picked this while trying to find noncomedogenic moisturizers with clean ingredients according to Yuka, but my mom helped point out to me later this has vegetable oil in it… Cool! 🙃 * its just perfect and a little goes a long way * I dont really know what people are saying about this product, most people are saying its lightweight and non greasy but it feels so heavy, sticky, and greasy on my face, maybe just not for me but I won't be buying this again * I have sensitive skin and this works well for me. Love that it isnt too heavy on my combo/acne prone skin * I was hoping this product would work well on my acne-prone skin, but it doesn't seem to do much for me. It doesn't absorb very well into the skin so the more you use the more ends up sitting on your face. The claims about this moisturizer being pre-biotic don't seem to mean much. Hero specializes in products for acne and acne-prone skin, so I assumed this moisturizer would work well in my routine and be hydrating but I was disappointed."

I look 15 years older. Literally does the opposite of what it's suppose to. Now I'm just praying these new wrinkles fade. * It's just temporary, so keep that in mind. * These are not very strong and theyre small. If you havent tried ""frownies"" i suggest trying those. Theyre cheaper for a larger quantity and better results. * I tried these on a few spots on my face, under eyes, smile lines, and 11 lines on forehead. I honestly wouldnt bother using these under your eyes because the adhesive is so strong it pulls at your skin even with wetting them. They did work well on my smile lines and 11 lines but they just soften the wrinkles, my results only lasted about 1 week. Personally I'd invest in a good quality eye cream over using these patches. * I love this idea and if it worked it would be cool but they don't stay on - followed directions to a ""t"" and still fell off within the hour.

I like how light it is, the price point, the volume of product, the consistency, & how long the bottle lasts. Its travel - friendly and good for all skin types. * This moisturizer is great for the summer or daytime, but personally its too lightweight for my combo skin. Its more hydrating than moisturizing and has a gel like texture.

All the ingredients are clean and i havent had any type of allergic reaction. Ive scanned it the bottle for acnegenic and condemenic ingredients and it had none and then i also scanned it for toxins and it had none.

253,kinship,supermello hyaluronic gel cream,pimprod2017767,2569973," * I wanted to love this product! The smell/texture is lovely.

Unfortunately, while sporting a ""clean ingredients"" tag and a tag from the national eczema association, I found the product to be highly irritating when I had a flare up. I only used it once during that time, and then after taking a second look at the ingredients, I found out that ""phenoxyethanol"" is a known potential allergen, irritant, potential endocrine disruptor, and the manufacturing process is highly polluting. In other countries the ""safe"" threshold for this ingredient is 1%, but it's hard to determine how much one is exposed to if applying daily/multiple times a day. Of course, there is no such regulation in US, so who knows how much is in this cream. 

At the same time I bought this, I tried products from cocokind which I highly recommend! They have a great price point and really are ""clean"" from what I have used so far, although one should always do their own research. While I was still having an eczema episode, I found using a homemade oatmeal paste + cocokind's chia seed oil was very helpful to get me through the dry itchiness. 

TLDR: not a clean product, could be irritating, check out cocokind. * I've been being treated for cancer for about a year and a half, now. Almost 6 months of that has been chemotherapy. Most products cause acne and rashes on my skin, since being on treatment. 
Pros: Did not irritate my overly sensitive skin. Smells good. I don't understand all the complaints about the smell. It is light and nice. It is kind of like marshmallows, but better. 

Cons: it moisturizes, but not enough while going through chemo. It feels great when I first put it on. But, after a few hours my skin feels tight again. Kind of like how vaseline can trick you into thinking your skin is moisturized at first. Hours later the surface of your skin feels tight and dry like a sunburn ready to peel. 

For the price, thete are much better options. Philosophy moisturizers are a lottle cheaper and give better longer lasting results for me in terms of moisture. * This is my 3rd time repurchasing this moisturizer. Unreal/ must try! * I do not want my face smelling like vanilla frosting but it did the whole time I used this. My fault but I'd literally have to hold my breath * Earlier this year my dermatologist informed me I have seborrheic dermatitis. I've been using ketoconazole shampoo which definitely helps but I still found myself needing to use cortisone cream on my face (gross!!). So I was researching moisturizers good for dermatitis and while Supermello isn't specifically marketed for dermatitis (it does list eczema) I thought it sounded like it may help. I am SO GLAD I gave it a chance!!!!! its been about 2 weeks now and my face is looking the best it's looked in several years. Patches that I thought were stubborn acne have been clearing up and are almost totally gone. the hydration level us just right so I feel moisturizes but don't get greasy as the day goes on. It does smell REALLY lovely with the light vanilla/Marshmallow aroma. Definitely worth trying if you have skin conditions that make you red/itchy! * I got this as a sample and wowww the smell is so good! It's very creamy so a little goes along way! Im so happy I got it as a sample because now Im definately buying more. I love this brand and it also makes my skin glowy and so soft. I love how my skin feels I usually use their Vitamin C then put on this cream and it leaves my skin poreless and soft. * My skin burns from water, I swear. I am incredibly sensitive to everything. My skin chaps, get red and raw, itches and burns. I have tried most of the major 'sensitive' skin moisturizers high to low end, and this is the absolute winner.

A few years ago, I was able to clear up my skin with a strict morning and night routine that includes prescription creams, but every time I would try using SPF, I would immediately break out. I've tried dozens of prestige and drugstore brands! This moisturizer with SPF is the first that hasnt caused a single breakout. I've been using it for over a month now and I will continue to as long as its on shelves. * This product is okay as a moisturizer and sunscreen but leaves you shiny looking. It also does not work well under makeup at all. I learned the hard way after I was almost completely done with my makeup and it began lifting and leaving ugly peeling patches when i used a powder brush. For the price, theres way better sunscreens out there. The murad sunscreen in a blue bottle is about the same size and the same price but works amazing. * I switched to this sunscreen and my pores and oily skin were controlled also my skin felt amazing!

I will definitely keep this in my beauty routine * I mean it...when I say I am nearly 30 and struggled with hormonal skin since I was 12..I have spent SO much money on skincare products, it's insane. Recently I bought a $150 moisturizer claiming it was magic, when THIS..PUR Cloud Cream (for a fraction of the price)..was all I've ever wanted and needed. It is the silkiest product and it just melts into the skin like a drink for your pores. I mix it with a dab of Charlotte Tilbury ""beautiful skin"" foundation and I feel like a million bucks. Immediate confidence boost. It's just enough tint to perfect the redness from my acne and scars...and it leaves the most gorgeous finish, like I just got back from the medspa and my skin is plump, hydrated, and GLOWING. I got this as a sample from Ulta and I had to come back here, buy the full size immediately, and leave a review. I knew nothing about it so when I searched it up I was expecting this to be much more expensive. A double win for it's attainable price!! Please never discontinue. * I am allergic to tocopherol acetate, and this is the only moisturizer I can find at Ulta without it. Thank goodness it works well. Feels nice, not greasy. Absorbs quickly, and isnt strong smelling. * This is one of the only things I can use on my face! I dont have to worry about my face sweating when
I wear it. It is lightweight and is scent free! * Okay so. I have extremely finicky, super sensitiveGr, combination skin. Ive tried lots of moisturizer brands such as Clarins, CosRx, Drunk Elephant, and Beauty Counter. As great as they worked, my skin sucked up the creams too fast and didnt last me throughout the whole day. Serums helped, but would cause me to break out in consistent trouble spots. The way it sat on my skin did NOT feel even. Rough versus smooth. And when using foundation, you could see the different textures. 

Since using Pür Cloud Cream, I can honestly say this is one of the most amazing products Ive ever tried?? 
When applying, a little is a lot. It smoothes out so evenly, feels cold and refreshing right off the bat. I let it sit about a minute or two, did a test feel of my skin. Let me tell you, the texture was IMMEDIATELY consistent over my whole face. Trouble areas such as the nose, above my lips, smile lines, and eyebrows were rich and hydrated. Im actually kind of shook how quickly, too.

When using foundation, it gave an airbrushed feel and look. My skin still felt smooth! And was definitely still hydrated. 

So excited for trying this product. Will DEFINITELY buy it again."

I am 60 yoa and have struggled with acne and skin problems since I was a teenager.  I believe it's mostly due to bad genes because my sisters and daughter also had acne problems. This moisturizer absorbs well, but because it is oil free, it doesn't leave my skin shiny or greasy looking. It makes my skin feel fresh and smooth. I do not look my age and I believe that using these Baremineral products contribute to my better looking skin. * I use this daily after cleansing. It is light-weight but easily covers my face & neck. It isn't oily at all. I have used other products in the past. They cause breakouts and leave my face feeling greasy all day or soak in immediately & don't create a good foundation. * Best moisture I have ever used. A little goes a long ways.

Using the whole set it's very expensive but if you are careful and use them as indicated they last.  I bought mine on October 2022 and run out of them in February 2023 bravo!!!

I'm 52 a post menopausal. I only gave it 4* because of the price, and the fragrance.  Most over the age of 50 will likely remember a bottle of White Shoulders sitting on their grandmother or mother's vanity, and that's what the smell of this cream reminds me of. Very floral and not just roses. I can live with the price, but I would definitely give it 5* if Lancôme would make a fragrance free version. The fragrance doesn't linger, but the smell reminds me of what old women smelled like when I was a child."

I have combination/oily skin and as much as I loved the products I always struggled with oiliness. I decided to take a break a couple years and I regret it. My skin has significantly changed and not for the better. I tried so many new products and nothing compared. I came back to Estee Lauder and decided to try this Nutritious line, and I absolutely love it!!! This one does not make me oily or shiny and I love the way my Estee Lauder foundation sits on my skin. I will say I bought a whole regime and I'm using the Nutritious essence and moisturizer, and the Perfectionist serum and SPF. I got them on sale during Black Friday sales recently and I couldn't be happier. I can say this moisturizer is making all the difference for me. * Not for me feels to heavy * I have quite dry skin and this product just doesnt work with my skin type. Makes my face look and feel dehydrated. I can maybe understand why this would work for oily folks but not enough for dry skin. * I got this creme in the Glow kit. When I cleanse my face, I apply it as a standalone and immediately see my face turn red. I have sensitive skin, plus large pores. :( * I don't see the hype. Texture of cream felt like light face lotion and went on just the same. I've used it twice as an over night mask and I woke up with dry skin. My Elemis night cream is 5x more nourishing than this ""face mask"" cream. * I live in the Arctic and the cold sucks any moisture out of my skin. I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts from moisturizers and new products. Basically if you touch it, it's going to have issues. I received a sample of this with my last makeup order and this stuff is amazing! I have been using it as my daily moisturizer and my skin is soft, hydrated, and most of all clear! I will be adding this to my daily routine. * I got this in a sample when it first launched and fell in love! however since I've gone through almost an entire full size jar, its just not hydrating enough for my skin even though I am very oily! I have acne prone skin and am super picky with ingredients so I had super high hopes, but it sadly fell flat. on goes my search for my favorite all day & night moisturizer 🥲"

Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy! * I can't believe it took me so long to find this amazing product. I will have it a part of my skin routine forever now! Such a great lotion for my whole body. Highly recommend purchasing if you have dry and sensitive skin. Game changing product so excited I found it! * As someone with dry and flaky skin, I've tried countless lotions over the years, but none have worked as effectively as this one.

The lotion has a rich, creamy texture that absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. My skin feels immediately hydrated and smooth after applying it."

It is kinda crazy because I've been using Bare Minerals makeup for 25+ years and never considered the skin care products. On impulse, I picked this up and I'm really glad I did. My skin is really happy. In two weeks it has reduced redness, dryness, and you can't see the lines on my forehead anymore. So if you want results without all the harsh chemicals this is the cream for you. * Been using this for a couple of years. This product usually lasts me 5 months. Am glad for that! * I love how it feels as I am applying it. It feels wonderfully soft and smooth. Will be purchaching more! Love It! * My skin was looking dull and dreary. I love bare minerals powder foundation, so thought I'd try their skin care. The ageless line is lovely, leave my skin clear, bright and smooth.

Yes, it does pill if it is not the last step in your routine. It is my 2nd to last step, and depending on how long I wait to apply the oil afterwards, affects how intensely the moisturizer pills. The moisture and effectiveness is worth it though. If I can't give a good 10 minutes before applying oil, then I will just skip the oil that night. * Biggest disappointment from Ulta so far… not moisturizing… for some reason it dehydrates my skin… dont waste your $$$ * This works great! A little goes a very long way. It's very moisturizer yet not oily. I love this night cream. * Doesn't absorb into the skin as quickly as I would like, but once it is, my face and neck are so bright and refreshed. * Keep The Phenoxyethanol out of products please! 
If Europe can ban Endocrine disruptors why cant we. 
This is like the only ""clean brand"" in the states. So dissapponting.. * I have combo acne prone skin for reference. 
This is like a light watery lotion but absorbs like a rich cream. It soaks right in and paces a velvety, supple feeling that I love. Sometimes my skin is drier so I could see me being able to use this during the day also without being too heavy. It does have a scent. It's like candy strawberry and flowers. It's light and goes away very shortly. You only need a little of this because it spreads so well. It can be easy to go overboard. I think this is definitely worth the money given the ingredients, packaging and how long this will last. Especially compared to other creams. I don't breakout but wake up with super soft, nourished skin. * I want to love this product so badly but the fragrance/essential oils in this caused my eczema to flare up. I'm so sad but I know it's on me for buying something with fragrance, natural or not. Otherwise I think it's a nice product it wasn't drying or anything and the texture is really nice just wish they had a fragrance free version. I will stick with the vegan ceremide cream"

Even the one my dermatologist prescribed! I went out on a limb to try this 2 in 1 sunscreen and it did not disappoint. Great mattifying and no white cast (I'm a brown skin gal) yet moisturizing. I took this on vacation and it withstood the very hot heat and sun. Two thumbs up for me. * My previous tube was great. Mattified the skin. Absorbed quickly. It did not make my skin oily. This newest tube is not good. While it still absorbs quickly it does not mattify my skin. I am very oily in a couple of hours if not before. I must note that i do shake the tube before use so i dont think im missing anything. * I used this as a cheaper alternative toy usual SPF  but it was greasy and broke me out. If i dont shake it i can see the oil. * I bought this sunscreen on accident because I thought it was a free gift and didn't check until I picked it up in store. However, I decided to use it because I needed a new sunscreen and surprisingly, this worked very well for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it sits on top of my other skin care products very well. This is also the first sunscreen that hasn't irritated my skin or burned my eyes which I truly appreciate because every sunscreen I've worn in the past had an extremely painful reaction on my eyes. I plan on repurchasing. * I use this product for daily use. It is lightweight and keeps your face clear and oil free. * i'm so glad i found this sunscreen! beginning with the biggest pros for me- i've seen no new breakouts, doesn't pill, and feels like nothing on my skin. i really hate when i can feel an spf on my face but with this product my skin feels light and clean. pilling and clinging to dry patches is very annoying and i've noticed ZERO pilling/exaggerating of dry patches. 

the few cons i have are very nitpicky- fairly strong smell and isn't mattifying. the smell is almost floral but mostly is just a normal sunscreen smell, which isnt a huge deal to me but might be too much for those sensitive to fragrance. i also wouldn't consider this a mattifying products which i actually prefer. theres little to no added shine but again, not very mattifying.

overall i'm so glad i finally found an spf that works on my skin!"

Cleanser feels clean w/o stripping. The extolment stings and works! The moisturizer also stings a bit but feels great on! Sensitive skin beware. * This is a great deal! Yes, the one product is smaller than they said in the details, but all of these still last a long time. The face wash has a really nice light citrus smell. I havent used the moisturizer yet because I couldnt read what it was exactly or when to use it (before looking it up) because the white writing on the transparent container was impossible to read on top of being partially rubbed off. So thats my only complaint. * Said the intense exfoliating treatment is a 1.7 Oz in description.  That is a lie.   It is only .05 Oz.   Not pleased. Want want I thought I ordered or a refund"

I have some staple products that I know give my face a glow like no other, but I can't use them every day because they only give me that glow with a few days between uses. I have used this product every day and night for a week, and EVERY SINGLE DAY my face has been almost unrecognizable. I feel pretty with no makeup on for the first time in my life, my makeup sits better on my face when I do use it, and the glow lasts ALL day, well into the night. Oh my goodness, no wonder it's sold out. You can even get away with no moisturizer with this product (I know because I forgot to put moisturizer on one day, that's how good this feels on my skin). For the record, I live in Florida, and have extremely dry skin which actually over produces oil to overcompensate in the humidity. Usually products like this make me break out, but this feels AMAZING. I never have products make my skin glow and not feel oily, but this one really works. This is not a paid review, I only tried this product because of the reviews I saw, bc I'm a creature of habit. I hate trying new products and am terrified of using my skin to test things out. The reviews were the ONLY reason I tried this and this did not disappoint. * Very hydrating on my sentive cobination skin. * I was told about this product through a podcast I listen to. I was currently using the Byoma milky toner and liked it, but still felt my skin could be better/more hydrated. I struggle with small dry spots depending on the day and just overall dryness. After trying this - mid winter- my skin has been supple and stays hydrated throughout the day. I was weary about trying just another toner but this one has surpassed my expectations. It has a light scent but it's manageable. I use a lot of the product at once so I only wish it came in a larger size. It's gentle and haven't noticed any skin irritations. * I hardly ever actually finish a product and if I do it's because I love it so much I can't find a replacement. This is that good- it's my holy grail moisturizing toner and it makes my skin feel so firm but not tight, and so glowy and moisturized! Just bought another one! * I cannot be without this toner ! Just ordered my third bottle, I use it daily and absolutely love it! It has helped so much with my skin, it does not iritate it at all (i have sensitive acne prone skin with rosacea) and leaves it feeling so smooth! I have not been breaking out as much since using this, in fact this product helps to keep my skin at bay when it comes to breakouts and random pimples. Cannot recommend it enough! * Very light toner, makes my skin look and feel amazing, I definitely notice that my skin looks rougher when I run out and don't have a back up bottle. * This is the best toner you could buy. Love that they use clean ingredients. Its very gentle if u have sensitive skin but still removes dirt, excess oils, etc. its a must buy, along with the other skin care products they have < 3"

It goes on smooth and isn't greasy. My skin feels hydrated, and I have a dark spot that has gotten significantly lighter. I highly recommend this lotion! 

Aveeno, please don't change this formula ever!! * I am happy this product does not dry out my skin, but I don't feel it will protect my face from sunburn.  That being said, my face was peeling because of the high strength of my lotion. At least it is now not peeling. * The moisturizer did help with my overall skin/was a decent moisturizer, but the pilling is/was so bad, almost constant, even hours after application. It also doesn't sit well under any make-up, even a just light skin tint. The smell is strong, but it honestly just smells like soap so that wasn't an issue for me and I kind of liked it. * This product is light and smells good.  I love that it has SPF. * I've used it for over 10 years. There's been changes with it over the years, but my skin soaks it up like a sponge and leaves me glowing. * Broke me out in hives! I have sensitive skin and for 3 days my skin was a flame. It finally erupted into hives on the 3rd day. Everything irritated my skin after using this.

First thing  I noticed was the color, which made me realize I had bought the gel cream. The weightless texure is nice but the smell is absolutely awful. I will not be using this product due to the smell. * I bought this when my previous moisturizer was about to run out. This was on sale and the reviews seemed overall positive. I've used it twice and it's going in the trash. It has a nice, lightweight feel on my skin but the smell is awful. I can't tell if it's supposed to be scented or if it's the smell of just the ingredients but it smells like it's gone bad. There are so many other moisturizers out there that work well, are half the price, and don't leave you smelling like something expired. * Absolutely love this! I never put lotion on my face and just started using this product and I get so many compliments now how nice I look and young. I am almost 45 but I don't look it. * My beauty consultant, Beautifull (yes! that is her name) is the best in the business! I had so many questions when I was looking for a skin routine. I must say my skin is WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. She is located in North Texas! * I stopped buying moisture surge (and clinique in general) earlier this year, and searched for a comparable moisturizer all of 2024. Out of the 15 products I tried this year, this has been the best option by far. I honestly think this gel moisturizer is even better than Clinique's because it's fragrance free and 100% cruelty free. So many moisturizers are also too heavy for my sensitive and acne prone skin, but this is so lightweight and absorbs quickly. It's definitely worth the price, and a little goes a long way. * This is so light and so hydrating, it does not leave any sticky residue on the skin and no harsh smell. It cools the face and gives it a nice glow * I'm in my mid 40s, with sensitive combination skin, and this gel cream has been absolutely fantastic!  My previous moisturizer was a bit too heavy, and this one is just right for day and night use!!!"

I own the tinted version as well, but feel like the tinted makes me look greasy after an hour... where as this version is more of a satin finish where I do not look greasy throughout the day (maybe a little bit on my nose after 6 hours of wear). If you're sensitive to chemical sunscreens, I will say I notice my eyes get a tad bit irritated from it after about 6 hours of wear also. I try to not get close to my eye area, especially on my eyelids with this version. Overall would repurchase. The Paula's Choice Youth Extending Fluid is very close to this with 50spf and I feel doesn't give me the sensitivity. * I work at ulta and I personally would not recommend this to anyone. Ive tried to use this many different ways and everytime Ive used it, it pills up immeditaly even with no other product and others that are also water based. * Have complained about packaging previously -- the convex bottom cap will not sit upright on shelf / counter. Then I couldn't access any product from the pump / tube so I returned it for an in-store replacement. This tube feels light weight-wise, but I am able to pump product out of tube. Suggest you return to previous packaging that had no issues. Meanwhile I'm looking around for a replacement. * Perfect sunscreen.  Lightweight yet moisturizing. * I used my sister's.  I really liked it.  Easy to use, it didn't leave a white cast, I like everything about it.  I have to buy my own now.  My sister won't let me have hers! * I have been on the hunt for months for a moisturizer with SPF that isnt overly dewy in order to skip a step in my routine and thought this might be the answer based on the reviews I read. This might work great if you wear foundation daily or are under 30 with no texture, and yes this doesnt feel greasy or oily BUT it makes me look greasy and oily. I only spot conceal on most days and when I use this I have to put powder on my face because it makes me look so shiny, and the powder doesnt really stick in areas i dont have makeup on. For the price I really dont think i will keep it. * The cap bottom is concave so it doesn't want to sit upright on a flat surface in my bathroom.

You can also get this product in their acne clearing kit, along with a foaming face wash and spot treatment. Love it! * Got this moisturizer as a wake me up for the cooling effect, but the amount of product doesnt even cross the verticle E in ""clear"" written on the front of the bottle.

277,pacifica,vegan collagen every day lotion spf 30,pimprod2017151,2566493," * It was just too greasy it started to break my skin out * I generally love Pacifica and have only purchased vegan/cruelty free products for the past 30 or so years. My usual store didn't have Andalou SPF face lotion anymore, which I've used religiously and happily for many years, and this was the closest alternative. I have never had a bad reaction to any lotion but this one irritates my eyes horribly, to the point of not being able to drive safely and having to wash my face and flush my eyes. Do not recommend! * I love this brand and I was excited to find a daily moisturizer from them with spf and even went through several bottles but I had to stop using it because it caused my eyes to burn and water profusely. I would also add that it has a very oily finish, so if you have oily or combo skin, this likely isn't for you. * I've used this through a couple of bottles. My skin takes time to adjust to products (hence why the couple of bottles). 

I love that it is cruelty free and has vegan collagen. I love that it has SPF 30, a must for me, BUT it smells like sunscreen. It is definitely moisturizing, I don't have an issue with dry skin, BUT it's rather greasy. My daughter has even commented that my face is really greasy when I wear it (not really the vibe I'm going for). The chemicals burn my eyes as the day goes on. If I even wipe my eyes, it takes me minutes to wipe away whatever traces of this moisturizer is around my eyes. If I regularly wore makeup, this would be extra problematic. If you wear contacts, I do not recommend this. Imagine that burning getting caught up under your contacts.

I really, really wanted to love this because I didn't want to go through having my skin adjust to a new product, but I can't justify it based on it being a habit. * As mentioned by others, this would be more accurately described as ""SPF 30 sunscreen with collagen."" Smells exactly like a normal drugstore sunscreen. It's light and doesn't feel too greasy (but there is still a bit of that feeling). Overall it's ok * Just finished my bottle and ordered another one.  I have sensitive, adult cystic acne, 44 yr old skin that is in the normal to dry stage. This product:
1) has a sunscreen like feel to it when you first apply it, then it fades away
2) has a great glass bottle that you can get ALL of the product out of!
3) Spreads well- at little goes a long way- to much will make it sticky and it won't dry down fast
4) plays well with Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid serum and PUR love your selfie foundation. * I'm getting older, and my skin is changing, and I hate it. My old favorite daily moisturizer/SPF by No. 7 started making me breakout after years of no problems, so I had to search for something new. All the others I tried that claimed to not clog pores also happened to be too drying for my slightly oily but aging but still acne prone and also kinda dehydrated skin (ugh). But the moisture level of this Goldilocks cream is just right. If you have dry or slightly dry skin you will probably like it, if you are 40+ you will probably like it, if you're young and have oily skin you might NOT like it because it is not a light liquid, it's definitely a thick-ish cream. I can tell the fragrance they were trying for was *floral* but it leans more chemical, although it disappears in a minute or two. After application the skin feels moist, but not greasy. Makeup applies perfectly over it with no pilling at all. I somehow manage to not look shiny over the course of the day, which is practically miraculous. It doesn't seem to make me break out, as I've been using it for several weeks with no notable flares. I am relieved to have found my new favorite!"

It does nothing for my skin… super greasy, no firming, and makes my skin look worse. For the price I expected at least a decent product. In my opinion there are SO many great moisturizers out there that out perform this and are cheaper. * Bought this because I like the day cream version a lot.  This however was just not a great formulation for me.  It simply NEVER absorbs into my skin and then it just rubs off on my pillow case or hands eventually.   And I don't use an excessive amount because of the price tag.  I'm a big fan of using the minimal amount required.  It's too late to return it, so it's just going to move into my graveyard of products that I can't bare to throw away because, $$$, but just don't work on my skin.  Le sigh.  But, I still love the extra firming day cream and all my other Clarins products.  I would recommend trying a sample of this before buying if possible so you know if it's a good consistency for your skin. * Excellent result 👍 * Light weight, non greasy.  Plant enriched.  Vegan.  Long lasting.  Eco friendly packaging. * Really recommend this line for girls after 50. I feel my face firming after second week and continue improving. * This product is amazing!"

This Also Helped Me Years Back When I Was Having A Long Going Acne Breakout. I Have Not Had Any Problems With This Product & Will Continue Using. * I did not find this product to be soothing.

After about 6 weeks, I tried some variations to ensure that there wasn't interaction with what I was using. It did not exacerbate redness or irritate; however it also, did nothing else. The earthy smell dissipates as it dries. Nothing changed  I would not waste my money in the future on this particular product. * I have rosacea and this product helps to soothe redness and prevent further reactivity. It feels good on the skin and smells great."
281,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial advanced repair barrier cream,pimprod2036682,2603779," * Good but expensive and not much product!! * Pricey for the small amount you get but it definitely feels amazing and a little goes a long way!! * This product has helped save my skin! Wearing the mask during Covid killed my skin barrier and I have not been able to revive it. Every product I have tryed has given me cystic acne or i have had a horrible reaction to it. And just when I thought all hope was lost this 💎 was recommended to me. I was a little weary as its a cream and feels like a balm. I am oily to combo and anything thick just make we more oily. This absorbs great as long as you dont over use it so find your sweet spot. Start out with a little cuz it goes a long way. This helps Hydrate my skin while I useing active to clear it up my breakouts. * While it does feel nice initially when you put it on that fades quickly and just makes my face feel tight. Absolutely not worth the price point. There are more hydrating options out there. * I have dry, sensitive skin & this cream has been a game changer for my skin. I love that this balm doesn't have shea butter like most balms because i suffer from acne & cannot use that ingredient on skin. This cream has cleared my acne (i assume because it has salicylic acid) & my skin just looks & feels so much healthier. I love it so much, but like someone else said in the comments…I wish they made a bigger size because i go through this stuff so quick since i use it day & night. * I have extremely dry skin. It's very sensitve and reactive due to an autoimmune disease. I can use hardly anything on my face. I use and like the Kiehl's cica but thought this would be better with the colder temps now. It's not. Skin is dryer and I can tell my skin barrier is unhappy now. It reminds me of using body lotion on your face (which I've tried a few times) it leaves a chalky matte finish too. Not good for my middle aged skin. 
Their Cica cream is far superior and so is anything by Ursa Major for all you out there with unhappy dry skin. This doesnt cut it as a facial lotion. * This is vry healing on my dry skin. It gave me a couple of whiteheads on my face, but I noticed that it really calmed the redness. It's a trade-off. I would rather cover a pimple with a little makeup rather than cover up the redness all over my face."

My 33 year old skin looks phenomenal! It's so moisturizing and soft on my skin with a beautiful glow. * Easily the BEST anti-aging deeply hydrating moisturizer I've ever used!!!! I've not only purchased the entire live for myself but family members and it's worth every penny. A LITTLE goes a long way! * The best face cream I have ever used. * This face cream was so expensive and I felt it didn't work for me. It made my face very sensitive and my foundation didn't stay well on top it. I was disappointed but will try something new. * I am loving the results of these products. * I've tried MANY MANY moisturizers. this one is THE BEST hands down! Use it day 1 and your face feels like a babys butt the very next day. That's how fast and amazing this stuff works. Nothing will make your skins feel this soft and supple. And no breakouts! (a few moisturizers make me break out for some reason but not this) The only downside is the price; it's horrendously expensive so I hafta wait until my bday & xmas gift cards and rewards points to buy it so I only buy it about once a year. A little goes along way so I can make it last a few months. I'm 56 with normal to dry skin. * I have used it for a week now. Like the way my skin feels I use it at night. Packaging is a little over the top. Contents is a lot smaller than it appears from the outside.

I wanted to try something new and saw good reviews for this product so I gave it a try and truly wish I hadn't. This moisturizer is heavy and sticky. It leaves my skin feeling…. just gross. It made my skin break out in these weird tiny bumps and caused an acne flare up. I would not recommend this product. * this is a very nice moisturizer BUT it pills horribly. it messes up the makeup i put on top of it everytime. no matter how much i rubbed it in. will be returned. * Melts onto my skin.

This is the first primer that i have used that doesn't leave my face looking dry & patchy after using foundation & powder. It also is very cooling so be careful around your eyes. It's also very good for sensitive skin & hasn't caused acne tk break-out. The only reason I'm taking a star off is because I don't really see any difference with my pores. I absolutely recommend this especially if most primers cause you to break-out. * Primers have always cause major breakout but this NYX Primer does wonders for my face! My face loves it. I am older and have combination skin. This primer goes on nicely amd makup stays on all day!

I ended up returning. * I have very sensitive dry skin, I've been searching for over a year for the perfect mineral sunscreen that doesn't cause acne or dry me out, I think I've finally found it!!! it can feel greasy when you first put it on but quickly absorbs. I reapply throughout the day, and honestly LOVE this product. it's so amazing. I bought it on a whim thinking I would end up hating it too like all the others I've tried, but I believe I found my sunscreen!!! I've been using it for almost 3 weeks multiple times throughout the day!! * I love this sunscreen because of the high Zinc Oxide for UBA/UVA rays and the ingredients make me glow! It absorbs pretty quickly and you won't feel oily as the day goes on. No eye irritation. It does reflect the sun light away from your skin. * 100% my favorite ever. Yuka has it wrong I looked up the ingredients myself and this one is my favorite. * Horrible product it gave me a rash. Supper greasy and leaves a white cast. Waist of money * Once I put it on it had a white cast and it turned purple on me … never EVER again. * Purchased on advice of sales associate. Very happy with sun protection.

I have redness/combination  and sensitive skin and not only did it help with my redness but my skin immediately absorbed it and at no point did i feel oily. A must have! * Best moisturizer I've used and I've used many.  A little goes a long way. * Ive been using this product for about a year now (i think) maybe a few months less than that.. I do like it, I can feel how it seems to be tightening my skin.. But, i havent noticed any difference. I have noticed at the very top where my hair line is, it gets super dry. I am not sure if it is the moisturizer or what but i have tried several different shampoos and conditioners and still have the problem. But i havent tried a different moisturizer yet. The smell does not bother me, it does smell good. I do feel like it isn't as moisturizing as it should be though… I really wish I could find the old Chanel Hydra Micro Creme! 

Honestly, I believe this moisturizer just depends on your skin type. I use it with my Chanel foundation.. I am still iffy about it because I feel like it also shows my ""fine lines"" more but I am not very good with all of this anyway. Lol * I unfortunately have sensitive skin, I find the fragrance to be irritating on me. Plus I have a bit of a break out coming in from hormones. I've been trying it for a while, I really wanted to love it. * Best product ever. * The No 1 Chanel line is phenomenal. I have 3 products now and will continue to add more. This is just what my ""mature"" skin needed. 
Thank you Katarina…Chanel and Ulta are lucky to have such a professional, knowledgeable and kind associate! * I got this as a sample and I immediately bought it once it ran out. I live in the desert so my skin gets really dry with the weather here, this moisturizer has been the only thing that's been able to hydrate my skin without leaving it greasy and my pores look like they're getting smaller. I'm pretty selective when it comes to spending money but this was well worth it."

For reference I have oily skin and ive had no issues incorporating into my makeup routine. * I've tried their regular moisturizer before & I loved it. However, this makes me feel like my skin is burning when I put it on. it's not too moisturing either. * Have used GLAMGLO and it is no longer available. So, I did some research and started to use ELEMIS. I guess it's ok except for the bottle it comes in, terrible. Very hard to come out, I ended up cutting it open and put the contents in a jar. Advice, change the container * I got a sample from ipsy— ordinarily I would not go for shimmery products but this gives such a healthy, natural glow on mornings that i dont have time to slap on layers of serum. It rules! * This product gives your skin a natural looking glow without looking fake. * i personally don't use it as a standalone moisturizer. i mix half with my lotion and it still provides a good glow that is almost overwhelming,but not. i love it and will always keep

I gave it a few tries I thought my skin was drying out because of the cooler weather but nope, this was the culprit! I cannot even fathom paying full price for this product. * I dont like the scent. It smells good when you're putting it on, but then it makes your pillow smell like wet dog. This dried out my face horribly and created big dry patches under my eyes and above my eyelids. I have to return it. * My skin is extremely sensitive to new products, especially retinols. This took a few weeks to get used to, but I'm now using it almost every night. My skin has SO much more life to it! * I recently switched my skincare line from Lancôme to Kate Somerville and let me just say that my face hasn't looked or felt this good in years. I have seen more results in only a few short weeks than I ever did with Lancôme. AND this line is less expensive. It's a win win! * For the first two weeks, everything was fine. Last night, I put it on and it literally burnt the skin off around my eyes. I love the smell and feel of it, but I please be careful if you aren't used to using retinol.

I decided to stop using it and my face was getting better. 
I'm so sad because this is not a cheap brand and this was definitely on the pricer side. I love their stabilizing repair cream super great.

A lot of gel creams dry down to nothing after an hour or two but this stays a lonnnng time. I literally use it like a nighttime rich cream, that's how nourishing it is. I tried the new vitamin c cream from Olehenriksen but its not as good as this OG one. May they never ever discontinue or reformulate! * My skin never looked better since using this entire line * you have no idea how many moisturizers I tried in my life and this became in my top 3. omg the glow I get with this is unreal. i get so many compliments from people about my skin when I use it. it doesn't break me out, it actually helped me clear my skin ! i will buy this again and again and I hope they will not change the formula! * I went on a trip and only brought this moisturizer for face and body. I got a little sunburn and used this and the burn went away over night with no peeling. I will forever use this as my after sun lotion. Highly recommend. * After using this product once I woke up the next morning with severe redness and achne-like bumps over my entire face!! I wanted to itch my face off it was so bad. Once I removed the product my face started to calm down. My skin is never sensitive like this, but it did NOT like this product what-so-ever!! * I wouldn't say that I am a fan of any skincare product, I hope they just do their job. Nothing has floored me like this skincare line. I bought this moisturizer because I bought the eye cream a couple weeks ago and LOVED IT. I can actually feel these products working on my skin. I've been blessed with normal skin and I can actually feel the benefits of this product. I feel moisturized and my skin feels ""alive"". I would highly recommend. * Big fan of Ole Henriksen products. I've tried them all and while its hard to choose a favorite, this is my go-to. It smells great (like a fresh orange) and feels even better. My skin just looks younger and better."

I can not get passed the smell at all. it does feel very hydrating even after first use. * As a beauty enthusiast always on the lookout for products that truly make a difference, I was excited to try the AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid. This lotion promises a lot—gentle exfoliation, brightening effects, and hydration—all while being safe for sensitive and acne-prone skin. 

By the end of the week, my skin looked more even-toned, and some of my dark spots had started to fade. The gentle exfoliation from the lactic acid helped in renewing my skin without causing any irritation or redness—a common issue I face with more aggressive exfoliants. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid exceeded my expectations! This dynamic blend of lactic acid and vitamin C not only brightens my complexion but also gently exfoliates. My skin feels smoother and looks more radiant. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula makes it ideal for use under makeup. This lotion has swiftly become one of my top choices for achieving a glowing, healthy appearance. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C is perfect for my normal to dry skin. It also brightens and evens out my skin. I love to apply it when my legs are out for a natural glow! * Looking for bright and radiant skin? Look no further! The lightweight moisturizing lotion contains 7% lactic acid for gentle exfoliation and Vitamin C for skin that will look glowy and fresh! My skin looks smoother and softer after just a few days! * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid is a staple especially for the Summer. I'm always on the hunt for some sort of vitamin c lotion. Since we have hard water that can be so tedious. Not only does it help repair my skin but I also get to brighten my skin at the same time. * I'm a big fan of the AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid AHA! This product truly brings out the radiance in my skin with its brightening formula that gives me a nice glow. I already own a few AmLactin products, but this one stands out to me because of its amazing scent – a lovely hint of cocoa that I adore. I believe this ingredient plays a part in maintaining the health and glow of my skin. I've noticed that the Vitamin C in this lotion is really working on evening out my skin tone and keeping it super smooth!"

This one is not for me but Olay doesn't make it easy to know which one of their products to use. * I purchased this moisturizer from Ulta and it arrived within a few days. I use the product both morning and evening even if I am supposed to only use it once a day. My skin appears brighter and it is definitely smoother. I even use it on my neck but so far I haven't noticed a difference there. * This smooths my face and doesn't cause breakouts which so many moisturizers do. I haven't found a moisturizer yet that doesn't break me out. It lasts all day and works well underneath your makeup or by itself. I definitely plan on continuing to use this. * A couple months back I went on vacation to the Bahamas where my skin ended up breaking out very badly.  I brought this moisturizer with. It felt like my face was burning off and every time I took a shower more skin peeled off my face. It was the most miserable time ever. I assumed it had something to do with the trip. A couple days ago I tried this product again, the next morning the same thing happened, immediately this time. My face is burning, feels hot to the touch, bright red and is breaking out with little bumps all over and starting to do that gross oozy thing again. Now I realize it's this moisturizer. It might be awesome on some, just not me. I really wanted to like this product but I wouldn't wish this horrible reaction on anybody. So I guess just be cautious and if you notice something doesn't feel right, stop using it immediately. * This stuff isnt just great for your face, but can work on other sensitive areas too. I had dark marks/hyperpigmentation left behind from a medical adhesive left on my thigh too long, and this genuinely helped to fade those lines to a point where they are less noticeable * I love the way this smells. I use it in the mornings, a little hint of citrus smell is nice to give you a little wake up. Goes on a little sticky, but drys smooth and soft. Definitely recommend. * I've been a licensed esthetician for over 5 years and also an Ulta employee. I got this as a gift for the holidays and had no interest in trying it. I'm such a skincare snob. Well, I tried it. I absolutely love this moisturizer. I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear it because I'm glowing."

Does not irritate my sensitive skin. Calming. Definitely a favorite face cream. * I bought this and absolutely love it!! I will definitely buy it again!! * I have acne rosacea along with endometriosis, so my skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and breakouts so easily. I have tried every moisturizer from the drugstore to my dermatologist prescriptions, and nothing, I mean nothing has compared to this. this has not made my face itch, burn, or breakout. it actually took away about 90% of my redness in the first 24 hours i used it. i never thought Chanel would be my life line, but its now my holy grail. if you are truly sensitive, and not just ""sensitive"" like the majority of women say and they use like Cerave on their skin, but seriously have sensitive skin, try this out. you wont be disappointed. id rather pay more for quality ingredients than anything from a drugstore. * I have been a hardcore Charlotte Tillbury Magic Cream fan. I started using tretonin so it was suggested I use this moisturizer before and after applying the tretonin. I absolutely love it. It's extremely moisturizing and smells amazing. My face is very dry but after using this it feel so soft and smooth. It's kind of small for the price but I love it so much I will suck it up."

It leaves my cracked, painful and psoriasis-prone face plump, dewy, glowy and hydrated for the entire day or night. It performs better than the majority of my high end brand creams do and is extremely gentle. Highly recommend trying. * It moisturizes my skin too much! It looks great under makeup, you wake up as if you had just washed your face, I love it! Super moisturizing. * I am of the darker persuasion in her late 30s and it is hard to find a moisturizer that does not over power you with the smell. But this, this one is lovely. It goes on like butter ladies. Trust me it blends well with other products too. * This cream smells like the airplane cabin bathroom pink hand soap, which is slightly offputting. It also feels thick and heavy without seeming to sufficiently moisturize my face, so I think this formula just isn't for me."

It leaves a beautiful glow and deeply hydrates but again, not for oily skin or if you leave in hot weather.Too heavy for a day cream * I got this product with high hopes. It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy. I don't like the packaging, but i've noticed a lot of brands going this route so its whatever. I would recommend it though."

I have oily acne prone skin and I've experienced no breakouts or excess oil during the day. * I got this whole line on a whim and i can definitely say its healed my skin barrier and got rid of my acne. This stuff goes on smooth and feels so good on my face, i wake up very refreshed, the spf in the morning version is a plus. Thank you ROC🧡😁 * I've been struggling with adult acne for about 2 years now. One of the things I've learned is if your skin barrier is shot - you're not going to heal your acne. This product has significantly improved my skin for the better. It truly does what it says: improves skin barrier. It also will help heal a breakout literally overnight which is amazing! * Been using it at night after my HA application and waking up with silky soft skin with faded blemish appearance. Will buy again."

309,roc,retinol correxion line smoothing max hydration cream,pimprod2037330,2605755," * I love the way it feels on my face. It is not oily or greasy. I haven't used it long enough to notice if it helps with wrinkles but I will let you know later. Some moisturizers feel sticky when you put it on, this one does not. It also has a nice smell to it. * I have been using this Hydrating cream for over one year now. I like how it works and how it makes my skin feel. * found this product on sale and thought I would give it a try, and so far, I really like it - feels nice and haven't had any bad reactions, nice find * Wow! I was blown away by how effective this max hydration cream by ROC is! When you first apply this you can feel it deeply hydrating your skin. It's fast absorbing and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. After about a week of use i started to notice a slight reduction of my visible fine lines and wrinkles. After about 3 weeks to a month of use I have much firmer skin. This cream is amazing! 
Contains Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol for maximum results. Dermatologist tested. Paraben free. Non comedogenic. Non irritating and fragrance free. 
I received this product free from Roc & PinchMe. * So gar I'm enjoying the  line smoothing max hydration cream. It's a bit thicker than I anticipated but it's creamy enough the it goes on smooth. After just a few days I noticed how hydrated my skin feels. I can't wait to see what the future holds in continuing this product.  Because I sure need it. Retinol these lines honey.. retinol these lines lol. Thanks ulta * ١like the effectiveness, moisturizing, and skin softness of the product. They mention it works well, leaves their faces feeling hydrated, and is the absolute best moisturizer they have ever tried. Some appreciate wrinkle reduction and the skin look. However,I have reported that the product can irritate sensitive skin and burn their eyes. Opinions are mixed on the scent and value for money. * Love the feel of my skin after putting this on. It's feel so soft."

Im normal to oily. * This is a thing that I searched for very light weight non sticky and effective * Put this moisturizer on and had to take it off within minutes bc the smell was giving me a headache. I dont Understand why skincare companies think they need to add such strong fragrance to their products. Will be returning this product. * I started using this about a month ago and I love it! So this will now be two of their skincare products I really like and does the job. And again, affordable! I use it in my morning routine and feels great! Goes on smooth and light weight. I would recommend! * I just bought this came home put it on and instantly got a headache from the strong perfume smell. It's like they dumped a whole bottle of floral old lady perfume in this moisturizer. I looked at the ingredients and it actually says perfume and that shouldn't be in a face moisturizer. Returning this immediately * I used it for the first time a month ago … my skin is glowing    It looks firmer and I definitely will buy again * I dont know what it is about this product but even if it is the onky thing I wear that day it atill peels and clumps on my skin after it dries. Nit a fan."
312,fresh,rose & hyaluronic acid lightweight moisturizer,pimprod2038854,2608278," * I have acne but also dry skin and this product was a solution for good hydration without adding any oil on my face. VERY good for moisturizing before doing your makeup. I live in Boston but also part in Florida and this product does not fail me. * I really wanted to love this. It smells amazing, it goes on feeling really nice and moisturizing. a little goes a long way. But the dry down is where it gets bad. it feels tacky and sticky and a weird gritty feeling that i just can't get past. It's hard to really describe but i just know i do not like how my skin feels after using this. I can't decide if i want to return it immediately or give it a chance for a week. It was a lot of money to spend to not love a product i use twice a day. * There's something about this that just feels a little luxurious. I purchased this on a black Friday sale otherwise I don't think I would've spent the money. Now that I've used it I will definitely repurchase in the future, even at the regular cost because I think it is worth it. I have oily skin and most moisturizers leave my skin oily because they are just too thick and creamy. This moisturizer is very thin and watery and glides on your face very smoothly and doesn't leave me feeling oily. I'm also a big fan of the rose smell. * this product is incredible!so glowy and hydrating!! also feels so luxurious! * I love that it's not greasy. I have acne prone skin and it doesn't make me break out. * Love this moisturizer! Definitely hydrating and it smells divine * I love how this product gave me so much moisture that i needed i used it both morning and night i love the smell and it does what it says it supposed to do."
313,kiehl's since 1851,ultra facial moisturizer spf 30,pimprod2002927,2536697," * A great product. * This may be a decent moisturizer for winter or indoor not sweating use. Do not use for outdoor activities. It will burn your eyes SO badly. I don't have sensitive eyes or skin but I was practically blind on a summer hike. Horrible! I expect more from a brand like this. * I do have to say I only just tried this product so I'm unsure if it will break me out in the future. However it feels lovely on my skin. Before I applied this product I had some slight dry patches on my skin and it noticeably reduced the dryness. It didn't leave any white cast on my skin (I do have very fair skin though) and it made my skin looks very dewy and glowing! I would definitely recommend this product :) * I really do not understand the bad reviews. This is a great moisturizer with SPF in it. I personally like an all in one product and with 4.2 ounces you get a good value for your money. Not only does this have great ingredients, it is hydrating, sinks into your skin very easily, doesn't leave a white cast, and does not make your eyes burn. My skin glows after applying and it also wears SO well under makeup!! I do not find this sunscreen to be greasy at all. It actually makes me less oily throughout the day compared to the other SPF moisturizer I was using previously. I was using the Cerave AM lotion but wasn't in love with it as it took a lot of TLC to blend in and made my makeup pill. I was recommended this product by a friend and I am so glad I bought this. For those concerned about fragrance I notice a very very slight sunscreen smell but it doesn't bother me and I am someone who is sensitive to scents. This is a chemical sunscreen so some people may be sensitive to that. I am someone who isn't. I prefer chemical sunscreens anyway because they usually do not leave a white cast and are more hydrating. Mineral sunscreens are always too drying for my skin and leave too much of a whitecast. * I love this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I just love how it applies and how moisturized my skin feels afterwards. * It's ok. Def more of a sunscreen feel. Doesn't leave a white cast but takes a while to soak in. I have to wait quite awhile before I can begin applying my makeup. Like a lot of Kiehl's products but won't buy this one again. * I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now and I swear by it. I put it on in the morning before applying my makeup and it works perfectly. I've found that some moisturizers make my foundation look kinda wonky, but my makeup goes on top of this one nicely. Also, I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this product. I'm never going back!"
314,cetaphil,hydrating moisturizing cream body moisturizer,pimprod2028655,2586929," * Fixed my winter lizard skin. Will be buying again and again * I started using retinol months ago, and my skin was so irritated that I had to put moisturizer on every hour to not be in pain. My dermatologist gave me a sample of the Cetaphil cream and I love it. I repackage it in a squeeze bottle for easier application. * I have sensitive, dry, acne prone skin and this moisturizer is great! It is truly frangrance free: no chemical smell, just completely neutral. It is not greasy and it absorbs quickly. I like that it's in a tub so there's no product wasted. * Love how it makes my skin soft . & helps my old skin with age spots & bruising * my sensitive skin gets dry over time and this helps it a lot. I am 10 years old and I live in Florida so this is a must-have * This product received the National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance, as listed on the NEA website. I passed over this product for years because the package does not include the seal. I was absolutely missing out. This jar cream is the best body moisturizer I have ever used on my eczema, dermatographia, contact dermatitis, and other skin disorders. It has absolutely helped my skin heal from flare ups as well as help prevent new ones. I do not use this on my face so I cannot speak to its effect on acne. It's comforting and relieving to know I have finally found something to mitigate the suffering. No more intense burning pain just from water or scratching until the skin is raw. This is not a beauty product to me, it's a medical necessity helping my quality of life. Be patient and give this a try, your skin will get better. * Im currently using this moisturizer along with a 10% Benzoyl peroxide cleanser and its the best. My skin type is dry but acne prone fyi. This moisturizer can be used for the face and body and my skin does not feel dry or tight, Simply moisturized."
315,la roche-posay,pure vitamin c anti-wrinkle firming moisturizing filler,pimprod2019700,2574392," * Not too greasy, perfect for combination skin. Helped minimize fine lines after minths of use . * Although I enjoy the smell, the bottle is manufactured so terribly that even the lightest pressure expels the cream outside and under the lid. It is already half way gone with only using it a half full of times because the lid does not lock and stay in place! Highly disappointed. * I need C10 now! * Vitamin C does wonders for your skin. I use this for daytime care in conjunction with the Redermic R in the evening. It's a great combo ! * I use Redermic C every morning as my moisturizer.  I put it on, let it stay on a few minutes to absorb, and then apply my foundation and other makeup. * I use for 1 year and my skin now looks better, my Dermatologist recommended it 👌🏼 * I used to use Dr Perricone products which are great but pricey so I read about the LaRoche line and some have gotten rewards from New Beauty Magazine. I gave it a try and I am very happy with the results ! I use Redermic R every other night and the Redermic C everyday in the morning. My skin looks and feels the same as when I used Perricone products. It consistently delivers."

The idea that it helps to brighten the skin without Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) won me over. I find Vitamin C can be too aggressive on my skin. * I love this moisturizer! Its my favorite to use day in and day out. It has an extremely soft, lightweight texture so its great for daily, but also has so many brightening, moisturizing, and mild resurfacing properties, its also great for my evening regimen as well. Ive noticed a lot of my dark spots evening out, and my skins surface looking more ""glass"" like. The Vitamin C & Beautyberry in this work together so well to be brightening & moisturizing. This is definitely one of my HOLY GRAILS!! * I seen a significant difference in my dark spots with this product! * This cream is amazing! It even tone my skin and took care of the dark spots. I've been it regularly, and I love the feeling of smooth and find lines! * Love how my skin looks more even * I do not have sensitive skin and this product made me break out. I'm 56 and never had acne issues. I do not recommend this"
318,belif,aqua bomb brightening vitamin c cream,pimprod2043263,2619878," * I love this moisterizer. I've tried so many, and my skin always lacked moisture and glow, even when the product stated it would do so. But this one delivers! Instant glow and hydration. I wake up with much better looking skin now. * I enjoyed the nice citrus scent and lightweight feel of this gel like cream. It absorbed quickly into my skin and left it feeling smooth and bouncy. I especially liked how intensely hydrating the cream is without feeling heavy on my skin. It's a delight, but so is everything else from this amazing Korean brand! I'll definitely be adding this to my skincare routine from here on out. I received this sample for free in exchange for my honest review. #pinchme #HAPPYPINCHER * A refreshing smell and feel on my skin. Perfect under foundation. * I had tried a sample of a belif moisturizer and was satisfied with it so when I saw this on sale I jumped on it. Some people complain about the scent but I really enjoy it. Kind of reminds me of fruity pebbles and makes me smile. A little bit goes a long way and works great for my combination skin. * I think this is best moisturizer I've ever used and can't believe how great it makes my skin feel. I have only used it so far in the dead of winter and it makes me feel completely moisturized, like I just left a facial. I also have rosacea and sensitive skin and this hasn't bothered me at all. The lemon-y smell is so amazing I kind of wish I had a body lotion that smelled like this too! * I'm regular customer. * This cream is awesome. My skin has a beautiful glow now."
