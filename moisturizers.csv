Even in winter. * Provided adequate moisture to under eye area and to whole face * This product is amazing. (Unlike their under eye one). Skin is noticeably smoother. * So rich and smooth * I very seldom post any reviews but this product deserves all the credits.  I am post menopausal and dont enjoy makeup or lots of products on my skin and had not found any other product that would absorb quickly and show immediate relief to the dryness on my face. I have now used this product for over a year (got a sample from ulta which is why I tried it in the first place) and I absolutely love it.  People often ask me what have I done to my face because of less noticeable wrinkles and the skin looks supple. I hope they never change this product because it is just perfect. * I loved the way this felt but it gave me a very bad allergic reaction. I went online and found out there's many other people who experienced this too. So be aware! * Does not set well with foundation. Too sticky.

 so very very sad 😔 * No problems except its hard to wash off * I've used this mask every night for the last 1.5 years, and my skin hasn't looked better. I'm 39 and have a history of cystic acne and plenty of sun damage from my childhood, so my skin is usually acne-prone and the weird combo of super flaky but also oily. This mask makes my skin feel super hydrated and doesn't irritate it at all. I also don't usually like things touching my face at night, but once this mask js on I don't even notice it's there. I've seen other reviews mentioning the smell, but I haven't really noticed much of a smell and I'm pretty sensitive to fragrances. If you want an affordable but effective gentle product, this is a great choice. * I really wanted to like this product due to its affordability and that is it formulated for sensitive skin but this product caused me to get small bumps all over my face and neck. Almost as if it clogged my pores. I used it for 8 weeks and as soon as I stopped, the bumps went away * it broke out my skibiti skin… rawr * this pruduct made my skin so soft and hydrated I love this and can't recommend it enough! * I love this sleep mask! My only con is it doesnt smell great, but at least it works great. Perfect for my dry skin"

Smells good, even though its a bit pricy.. all you need is a little bit especially if your face is still a tad bit damp. If your considering buying this, you should. * Recommended by a dermatologist.  Works well. * This is always a staple for me. Anytime I try something new, I regret it and come back to this! * Love this product. Feels great on my face. * I continue to use this product over and over as it keeps my skin healthy and glowing. It feels good as well as looks good. It is such a great product. * I loved the non-spf Hope in a jar.  The store was out of that and only had this spf-30 so I bought this.  I returned it.  It doesn't feel the same.  It's greasy and pasty.  After applying makeup, my skin was shiny and oily!
  It doesn't sink into my skin like silk as the other smooth-glow moisturizer does.

I dont have sensitive skin and most/all the moisturizers I have used in the past don't cause me to break out, but this one caused some of the worst, deep, breakouts I've ever had. At first I was hesistant to think this broke me out but after my second and third use I continued to get deep painful pimples all over my face. I also didn't see any benefits to this product since it's: not hydrating, thin formula, small package for price, scent is slightly fermention-like. *deep sigh* as I throw out this product. * I love this moisturizer and have been using it for over five years. I have sensitive skin and dimethicone breaks me out. I appreciate that this product is gentle and doesn't break me out.

I can't recycle the container in my area and it isn't quite enough moisturization in the winter.

I appreciate the lack of scent and how well it applies * In my opinion- so overrated, Its kinda like most other moisturizers. This product is just OK. * i don't recommend it because it broke me out after the first use lol * After my favorite moisturizer was discontinued, I tried so many moisturizers that were supposed to be for sensitive skin but irritated my skin and made my rosacea flare up. Then I tried this because I read a review that it helped someone's redness, and I had the same results. I absolutely love this product. First moisturizer ever that not only doesn't irritate my face, but actually calms my skin. A little bit goes a long way and it is moisturizing without being greasy or giving me zits. Highly recommend! * Gettings ride of most of my acne and makes my skin look nice and smooth by the next day! (Im being serious!) * Absolutely love this stuff. Best moisturizer I've ever used hands down. I have very sensitive skin and dread trying anything new, got the mini of this and loved it, then purchased the 1oz and then the 3.3oz. My skin has drastically fewer breakouts, is plumper, brighter and overall looks healthier and hydrated. It's expensive, my only con. My skin looks so good that I budget lol. I combine with DE's C-Firma Fresh Vitamin-C
Day Serum and every other night with A-Passioni Retinol Cream(new to using retinol and zero issues!)."

My foundation used to look patchy and cakey, but this product has helped prevent that so far. I'm definitely buying more of this! * I recently started using tret & got a couple burns. This is so moisterizing, doesn't irritate my skin at all. Feels luxurious. A little pricey but I'll definitely repurchase! * Very lightweight, but moisturizing. Love it!! * I got this as a free sample at ulta..used for 2-3 days with huge expectations but i hate this so called hyped moisturizer…my skin became extremely dry after applying it..also it caused skin peeling * I feel my skin face soft and looks healthy. * I have extremely sensitive skin and suffer from papulopustular rosacea, which lately has been confined mostly to my nose. I have used Clinique Gel Moisturizer for over 16 years, but it started making my rosacea worse recently and burning my skin.

I received a .95oz sample of this Kiehl's moisturizer from Ulta and was very happy with the ingredients list. I am even more happy with the results!! This moisturizer has transformed my skin. It's happy, clear and nothing in this irritates my skin. My skin LOVES this stuff. This is my new go-to. Even in the humid midwest summer heat, it doesn't clog pores and really does pull moisture into your skin. I'll be interested to see how it works in the winter but I am hoping for my best winter skin with this new product.

10/10 would change nothing except the price, but I'm saving money just by having healthy skin. * don't be fooled. I thought this would be a nice simple, fragrance-free moisturizer for my acne prone combination skin. after 2 weeks of use I experienced whiteheads, oiliness, dryness/itchiness/irritation, texture EVERYWHERE and deep, cystic pimples that hurt to the touch. it hasn't been as bad since, but it took me 6 months and lots of adapelene to clear the acne and scars. I looked it up & my suspicions were confirmed- this ranks highly for comedogenic ingredients!! be careful and pls spare yourself if you have acne prone skin. im sure its a great moisturizer for other skin types."

It was recommended to me because they were out of stock of my go-to product (a different brand). Upon applying a thin layer of Tula 24-7 Weightless Moisture Day & Night Gel Cream to my face and neck, something instantly felt off. The texture was fine so I couldn't place what it was. A minute or so later it started - the slight face burning. Minutes passed and it got to the point I couldn't ignore it and had to wash my face yet again just to get it off! * I received this as a free sample and now I'm hooked. It works so great for my skin. It leaves it refreshed without being heavy. Other moisturizers can be too thick but this is thin and blends perfectly. Worth the purchase! * I started using this moisturizer about one month ago because Tula discontinued my favorite, Super Soothe. I call this a very happy accident, because now my skin is better than ever. Very soft, smooth and moisturized. I'm 64 years old with very sensitive skin - most everything breaks me out. But my skin just drinks this in. It's not sticky, and I don't think my skin has ever been so soft - with zero breakouts. I do always use the Clear It Up toner before I moisturize - I'm sure that helps. * My skin is oily but I still want a plumping hydrating effect as I'm in my late 30s. Most gel moisturizers are too lightweight for me, this one is neither too light or too heavy.  The lactic acid gives a gentle exfoliation so my skin looks more even. * I love the original 24/7 moisturizer but i wanted to try something lighter for under sunscreen in the summer. I felt that this would be the perfect solution. It is light weight, but it doesnt feel like it dries down on my skin and left me feeling very sticky all day. I have combination skin with some dry spots. This felt hydrating enough but I just cant get past how sticky it is, and the smell is a tad unpleasant. I will be sticking with the classic 24/7 moisturizer in the future. * Light, perfect moisturizer for morning & night with all the goodies. No need for extra facial oils. Plus, there are no harsh chemicals."

Ive used it for years and have gotten several people on it, however, recently the formula changed. It used to be lightly scented, non-greasy, and my skin would suck it up and fine lines were gone. Now it sits on the surface as an oily puddle, runs my makeup, and clogs the pores. I put it on every night while I find a replacement and I get dry patches in the sensitive parts of my face. Do not purchase this, and search reddit for something suitable for your skin. IT do better. * I used the old formula for years and absolutely loved it. The new one is horrible. It's sticky and broke me out after the first use. I won't purchase again. * I have dry skin, some large pores and a few lines. I was really hoping this cream would work for me, but after it absorbed it made my dry skin feel even more dry. It feels good applying it, goes on smooth, doesn't have a strong fragrance. I feel this is better for people with Normal or Combination skin.

Bottom Line: No, I would not recommend this to a friend * This is one of my favorite moisturizers! This baby never fails me! Gives my face the nice humid, plump, and healthy glow. It's so good that it even locks in that moisture for 24 hours leaving my skin very soft and smooth. I've gotten compliments on my skin with this after using it religiously. * I really love how it plumps fine lines and wrinkles and makes them look less noticeable * I am still testing this product.  So far, I have been pleased with it.  IT moisturizer is not heavy or greasy.  It goes on lightly and works well under sunscreen and makeup. * I am always looking for an excuse to not buy this bc of the price but I will continue to do so. Its so good. I wait for a sale"

Then on september 18th i bought a bottle (3.3oz). The formula was completely different; The texture, everything. It left me with a rash all over my face. I dont know if they have changed the formula or if this was expired but i am going to email the conpany to ask. I am so disappointed. I cannot find the way to upload the photos or i would. You can tell by the swatches on my hand they are different. * So good smells a little funky * This is very good basic every day moisturizer that does not feel greasy at all, absorbs  quick and performs well under foundation. I even use it under tinted moisturizers because it helps with longevity of any product. I hope it never gets reformulated or discontinued. * I was hesitant to buy this moisturizer because the reviews i saw were mixed but i thought i would give it a try. I'm glad I bought it because i LOVE this moisturizer its the best one ive ever tried. I had bumbs on my forhead and it completely cleared up my skin and in just a couple of days. I wish i would have taken pictures to show you. My skin is normal to combination so sometimes my t-zone get oily but this moisturizer is so lightweight and non greasy it works really well with my skin. Its also great for both winter and summer. I think a little goes a long way so when my skin feels extra dry i just add a little bit more and it works perfectly. It absorbs really good and makes the skin soft. I have tried other moisturizers and come back to this one.

I have been learning the tricks and as far as priming, this just feels like a moisturizer to me. It's a nice, light, non greasy moisturizer but the scent it has is not my favorite * Started using this as my overall moisturizer day/night and I cannot believe how much my skin improved. My skin hates everything as oily, combo or dry depending on the product but this keeps it hydrated, glowly and improving my complexion. This also does not clog my pores and everything I have used typically does. Yes it is pricey but at this point I think I finally found my product to cure my skin! * This is one of the most recommended primers. I wanted to love it. Its creamy and smells good but its not moisturizing. I always feel like im falling short in my face prep. I also cant tell a difference in my make up between this and drug store make up. * If you struggle with finding something thats good for your combination of oily and dry this us your girrllll ! : background im aa and 25 the primer hydrates the under eye and keeps you from looking oily . Yes its pricey but again a little goes along way and a + everytime you put it on your face be feeling so refreshed lol . Make that investment if u want a flawless base … * You still need a moisturizer, but once it drys down a little, put this on your fave in luei of primer, and youre golden. I had all day wear, and zero cracks and cakes in my foundation. I'm almost 40, with textured skin. * Honestly this was not the ""best"" primer and moisturizer that is made. All the Ulta Beauty Consultants kept recommending this Primer and honestly im not happy. I've used it for two days and I have a NASTY break out going on, on my cheeks. The smell is disgusting. Smells like a cheap Bleach cleaner. Its Gross. My make up does not stay in place at all. I use Charlotte Tilsbury Foundation so I know its not my foundation doing this. I use Urban Decay Setting spray. The primer did not help set it at all. If anything it moisturizes your face and that's it. Im tempted to do a return but it is what it is. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY. Just don't. I was so excited to try this stuff and I'm super disappointed."

Even prescription medications failed to heal it. I bought this at Ulta over the weekend, used it twice a day and by the third day my hands were completely healed. No cracking, bleeding, itching, or peeling for the first time in two years. Absolutely amazing! * I am allergic to dust and was having an allergic reaction. My skin was bumpy, itchy, and so red! A friend of mine recommended this and within a day it significantly calmed my skin, reduced redness, and made my skin less bumpy. It is a bit greasy but a little goes a long way, and even though it is thick and a little greasy it will not break you out. * love this cream and the og formula but WHY would they reformulate to add shea butter when it is a very common and well known pore-clogger…

It contains SPF 50 and has some great ingredients that great for the skin. It highly recommend it. * I loved this moisturiser + sunscreen as it made my makeup go on smoother and caused less creasing but this is NOT for acne prone skin. Broke me out in tiny white acne all over my forehead. Wish it was non comedogenic. I liked everything else about it. * This moisturizer really did go on easily, particularly for having an SPF that truly did protect my face from burning in the summer.It smells nice, too-just a hint of that recognizable  Dermologica smell to make you feel energized. I just don't think I can add it to my repertoire due to the price point. I use and reapply sunscreen to my face daily, especially this time of year and wouldn't be able to purchase this on a regular basis given the high cost. If you are looking for something that feels good on your skin, is easy to apply and is an effective SPF-try it if you can afford routine purchases of it! * This goes on very light, and smells great. Does not pill with foundation on top. It is a good moisturizer, but won't feel greasy for the rest of the day. No sunburns yet! * It isn't too greasy but doesn't sit well under makeup and made me breakout, even when using without makeup. * I have been using this product daily for years. Every time I begin to debate repurchasing (due to the price point), I get mistaken for being 24 even though I'm 30. I always end up back at Ulta getting another bottle. It's very moisturizing for how thin it applies to my face. I never feel greasy or like my skin can't breathe. I swear by this product... worth the money! * I really like how this moisturizer makes my skin feel. Great to have high SPF the without it feeling heavy or sticky! No breakouts or irritation.

Wouldn't wear underneath make-up, for sure. * I was using the glow watermelon and it was alright but my skin now is so soft and looks so healthy and it really glows without feeling greasy or making me look super oily"

I have been learning the tricks and as far as priming, this just feels like a moisturizer to me. It's a nice, light, non greasy moisturizer but the scent it has is not my favorite * Started using this as my overall moisturizer day/night and I cannot believe how much my skin improved. My skin hates everything as oily, combo or dry depending on the product but this keeps it hydrated, glowly and improving my complexion. This also does not clog my pores and everything I have used typically does. Yes it is pricey but at this point I think I finally found my product to cure my skin! * This is one of the most recommended primers. I wanted to love it. Its creamy and smells good but its not moisturizing. I always feel like im falling short in my face prep. I also cant tell a difference in my make up between this and drug store make up. * If you struggle with finding something thats good for your combination of oily and dry this us your girrllll ! : background im aa and 25 the primer hydrates the under eye and keeps you from looking oily . Yes its pricey but again a little goes along way and a + everytime you put it on your face be feeling so refreshed lol . Make that investment if u want a flawless base … * You still need a moisturizer, but once it drys down a little, put this on your fave in luei of primer, and youre golden. I had all day wear, and zero cracks and cakes in my foundation. I'm almost 40, with textured skin. * Honestly this was not the ""best"" primer and moisturizer that is made. All the Ulta Beauty Consultants kept recommending this Primer and honestly im not happy. I've used it for two days and I have a NASTY break out going on, on my cheeks. The smell is disgusting. Smells like a cheap Bleach cleaner. Its Gross. My make up does not stay in place at all. I use Charlotte Tilsbury Foundation so I know its not my foundation doing this. I use Urban Decay Setting spray. The primer did not help set it at all. If anything it moisturizes your face and that's it. Im tempted to do a return but it is what it is. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY. Just don't. I was so excited to try this stuff and I'm super disappointed."

The only thing I don't like is that it's very think compared to the trial size * I have had really bad acne at times but I love this one of my favorite moisturizers it feels really good on the skin i will buy again * okay so if you are in your teens I wouldn't recommend this. I have normal to combination skin and l asked for a sample of this and it cleared my skin  like I was GLOWING✨ When I ran out I decided to buy the big size. EVER since I bought that I have had the knarliest pimples and I broke out sooooo bad. It just went downhill ever since I started using it. It's the same stuff I was confused. like why?? it's the same??

So I did some research and most things were telling me the ingredients are not good for young teen skin and it can cause your skin to be agitated and cause breakouts.

It might just be me going through this but after I bought a cheaper lightweight moisturizer and it cleared my blemishes.  I feel like everytime I use lala, it's super heavy and thick. My skin feels weighed down. If you are thinking about buying the lala do some research first. I hope this helps! * I really wanted to love this product but after two uses i started breaking out badly and for the price I returned right after i broke out and switched to better more affordable products that dont brake my skin out. * I emptied it and I need to buy another its the only drunk Elephant product i will constantly re-purchase"

For that, I use La Roche-Posay's Effeclar Mat moisturizer. I do still keep this one on hand for use on my neck, thus saving the more expensive Effelcar Mat for the areas where it's really needed. It does provide nice hydration and is generally lightweight, but misses the mark on really providing a matte finish. I would feel better if this product was not marketed as mattifying, but rather just a light, gel-cream hydrator for oily skin. * I have oily combination skin and a lot of products make my face extra oily. I was skeptical about this product but was recommended to me because it's matte. I would use this by itself or after I apply niacinamide serum on my face and it's very cooling and not oily at all!

For about over a year I have been struggling with my face (ezcema, acene, other dry spots, discoloration) and Cerave products were my holy grail, until it wasn't, since then I have tried numerous products, spent $$$$ and nothing work. For the last 3-4months I have been using La Roche Posay face wash & face moisturizer and its been blah. I have only been using it bc i refused to try something else and spend more money. Finally, my sister suggested Dermalogica and OMG!! All this time I had been suffering. I bought the travel size to test it out bc the full size are pricey, but let me tell you, I don't care they are expensive anymore. I have already purchased the full size products and have a full regimen for my facs. Like I said, 

I've only been using the face mositurizer, face wash, the blue bottle exfoliter (twice a week), and the brightening kit (only at night) (all travel size) and my face looks & feels amazing. 

These are expensive products, but theres a spanish saying ""lo bueno cuesta"", in english ""the good things cost"" and with these products, I can agree. Also, a little bit really goes a long way. For the face wash, I only use a pea size and its really more than enough and prettu much same off all other products. * It moisturized my face so good. Unfortunately, i cant stand the bad smell…its so bad! * I am 48 and have been bouncing around forever trying to find the perfect cream for my combination skin.  A little goes a long way.  No greasy residue and moisturizes my dry spots all day long.  My skin is smooth and fine lines are completely blurred after a few weeks of use. Best cream out there for my skin. * I enjoy the smell it reminds me of baby lotion. My skin has never looked so hydrated until this product. I don't think I will ever try after moisturizer. * . * Smooth on no residue. Leaves your face feeling moisturized without an oily finish. Great size for travel. * I'm disappointed becaude thevreason i got this dacial moisturizer is because i remember getting a facial dobe at a spa in the wibtertime a few years ago and this is the moisturizer they used. Not sure uf the formula changed or its just me but it definitely does not feel the same on my face as i remember. I remember being very hydrated and moisturized when i was given the facial, even the next day, whereas when i put this on, it feels like it disappears right away. On top of that, it is very scented like soa, which I don't like walking around and smelling my face all day. On top of that, as soon as i put on the moisturizer, it made my eyes feel the smallest sensation of burning a little bit. Will not be reourchasing again."

This Charlotte Tilbury Magic Creme has a delightful scent and provides excellent moisture, but as someone with combination/oily skin, I found that it left my skin feeling overly oily. Despite its richness, it absorbed quickly, unlike other creams that require a lengthy wait before applying makeup. The texture is incredibly smooth, and the cream glides effortlessly onto the skin. It's quite thick, so a little goes a long way, making it long-lasting. However, I would recommend this creme. * Charlotte Tilbury truly has some amazing products and this magic cream is absolutely one of the most luxurious fave creams I have used. Great scent, feel, and overall leaves your face feeling moisturized with a light feel. This is my go to face moisturizer, it is thick so a little goes a long way and absorbs  into the skin so well. * A beautiful cream that absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft and velvety, while giving a plump and glowing appearance!!!  Works amazing as a primer before makeup or alone for a fresh faced appearance.  I am only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I am not a fan of the scent.  It reminds me of cold cream… * The magic cream is magic this cream has made my skin feel super hydrated. My laugh lines have completely went away and I have only been using this for about a week in a half. I have also received a lot of compliments about my face looking more radiant. The price is really decent for the amount of product you receive and how well it works. * This is a very nice cream that hydrates your skin well. It goes on kind of sticky feeling, but I didn't have any breakouts or redness, which is pretty amazing, as I have sensitive skin. The packaging is impeccable! * Very good ingredients, very effective, keeps my skin hydrated. It has a soft scent. The packaging is beautiful and safe.

Next step should be a discount for auto replenishment customers… * I've been using this cream exclusively for the last year and can't go without it. I'm in my forties and get compliments on my skin all the time. I don't really have lines or wrinkles, but this keeps my face smooth and firm. The only con would be that it's heavily scented.

Other than the cost- i would highly recommend it! * I got this item in Gratis (free). I love drunk elephant and was so excited. I've tried their other moisturizers and they werent moisturizing enough for me at nighttime, so I switched to the Murad repair cream. Thats a beautiful, thick moisturizer in a pump bottle just like Drunk Elephants. Its been my holy grail and I was fully prepared for this to not compare. When I tell you I immediately pushed the murad to the side I mean it. This cream is THICK and so hydrating. Winter is coming. If your skin is dry you need this! * I am rating this a three only because this cream is definitely not for everyday use. It drys my skin if used daily. I use it every week now & I no longer have the drynesss I noticed before. * I bought this for my husband hoping it would work, and I had my doubts. I have tried so many barrier creams out there and none of them seemed to get the job done. My husband completely destroyed his moisture barrier by the way he just scrubs and scrubs his face. He would even spray alcohol on there (yikes!). And his face would stay dry and peeling in a super bad way, and no ordinary hydrating moisturizer would help. So I knew it was a moisture barrier problem. And I have to say, out of all of the barrier creams we have tried, this is the holy grail! It sucks at how much it cost but it delivers on it's promise. His skin has never looked better. No more flaking and red skin. This is magic in a bottle if you have a moisture barrier problem because I have spent HUNDREDS on other types and none have completely healed it like this one has. I am sticking to this 100% and we are thrilled with the results! I can't recommend this stuff enough. Spend the extra money and get what really works. * I am a mother of three children and one of which is a girl. When she showed me this brand and this product I said no, but after trying this moisturizer  for myself and doing some research, I fell in love. This is one of my favorite products now. * This is a nice, rich moisturizer. I love it as a last step. It is ideal for super dry or mature skin or skin that gets dry in winter. It works best for me when used over a lighter moisturizer/hyaluronic gel cream, almost as an occlusive. It loses a bit of the magic when used alone. I don't believe in making ""smoothies"", I layer my skincare, so I cant speak to that process. * This is my favorite Drunk Elephant product. The results were immediate. It moisturizes, reduces redness, and makes my face feel smooth. I mix it with protini and marula oil and my skin loves it. No break outs. I recommend it!"

And I've tried what feels like a million and one moisturizers. With this, my make-up no longer looks patchy and stays glowy all day. Obsessed. * I have oily and acne prone skin and at first, it was really nice as a spot treatment and faded my acne. I tried using it as a moisturiser because I had acne all over, and it just ended up burning so bad and my skin never gets irritated, even with new or more potent products. It's also super watery when I try to use it. * I recommend this product if u want to restore ur skin barrier and need a soothing element to your skin care routine! Once i incorporated this product to my skincare routine..it has been a HOLY GRAIL FOR ME! 1000% recommed trust me * Got the free sample and loved it when I put it on my blemishes they would heal much quicker so I bought the large size and put it all over my face and after a couple weeks started breaking out with large acne everywhere.  Unfortunately, I thought this was gonna be a new breakthrough for my mature skin. * I had used this product several years ago after pixel laser treatment with positive results.  It was my DIL who inspired me to purchase it again and use it for everyday skin irritations.  She uses it on her toddlers face to clear skin irritation from wind, sun, and cold.  I used it to clear a recurring rash near my mouth and it cleared quickly.  I could apply it under makeup too.  My husband is using it to help heal a cold sore.  He used the cold sore products first few days then this for healing.  No drying, cracking, and bleeding. * I bought this unintentionally because I wanted to get a Thermal Spring Water Spray in a travel size on the go. By accident, I got a burn on my forehead while using my curling iron, you know doing cute curtain bang. Then, I reasized the advertising picture on the box !!! I was like why not just testing it out for fun. So I put a thick layer on top of a red, pus-filled spot for 4-5 days. The spot was actually healing super fast comparing to my acne marks around my face that have been sitting there for months. And after a week I don't notice it anymore. And from day forward I've been putting the cream on top of my acnes and acne marks every night and it's been soothing my skin so much.
It doesn't happen overnight, though, my skin feels less irritated day by day. GIVE IT TIME & CONSISTENCY * I've been scouring the internet for help with the peri ocular/perioral dermatitis I've been struggling with for months.

I have pretty sensitive skin, and it hasnt broken me out at all. * I really like the texture of this cream, it feels very smooth. It is thick so its easy to put on too much. I do echo what others have mentioned about it pilling, the key is to give enough time for all your products to absorb and don't over apply. * My skin is hydrated now that I've been using this product. * This year one of my goals is to really work at a skincare routine… I started 3 months ago with a retinol and a niacinimide serum just using a very basic moisturizer. It was pretty heavy and made my skin feel heavy.
I got the FAB firming cream because of the reviews and figured I could combine certain steps of my routine! I've noticed a big difference in softness, and elasticity of my skin since I've started using it.
The texture is absolutely amazing, doesnt feel thick but does feel moisturizing. I dont wear a lot of makeup anymore, but what little I do lays very well on top of this. No pilling. At little goes a long way!
There's a lot of good things to say about this moisturizer but I'll leave it at this! If you're thinking about trying it, go for it!"

I only need to blot once a day at work instead of three! * I have used FAB products before. Always liked their daily moisturizer but i have oily skin so it didn't help, but this oil control moisturizer helps a lot. My skin doesn't look as shiny. Perfect product for summer. It is not heavy at all. * In my search for an oil-free moisturizer this was recommended. I used this for a month and loved it. No breakouts, controlled my oily skin and seemed to work really well. So, I stocked up and got more. I noticed something was different after the 3rd use of the new jar. I started breaking out. I haven't broken out in almost 3 years. I was confused and continued to use it because why would it start breaking me out now? I loved the first jar. I'm not sure if the formula changed or if my skin is just being finicky. 

Overall, I recommend the product because it seems to be very good. It's a struggle for us oily girls to find products that offer us a balance of hydration while keeping oil at bay. I hope it works for you if you try it :) * Ever since Neutrogena discontinued their Oil-Free Moisturizer for Combination Skin - my holy grail of moisturizers - I have been desperately searching for a replacement that will keep my breakouts under control without over-drying my skin. The search is finally over - this is it!! My skin starting clearing up and looking healthier after the first overnight application! I've now been using it for 2 months and it's continued to significantly reduce my breakouts (in frequency and duration) without drying out my skin. The only downside is that the container is about half the size I was assuming it would be, based on other FAB products I've purchased. (Although that's on me for not looking at the size printed on the front of the product.) Each container lasts me a little over 2 months with one application per day on my face and sometimes neck and/or chest. Honestly though I'm in love. * Ive used this product for about 2 months now and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin and have used several different face moisturizers over the years and this is the only one that keeps my face from getting super shiny by the end of the day, even with serums underneath it. It WORKS so to me its worth every penny! * This is the best moisturizer I have ever found for my oily skin! I have an oily t-zone and this keeps my skin from becoming oily all day. I worked an 8-hour shift wearing this and when I got home my forehead was still dry, but not peeling, it just felt finally normal. I use this on my entire face, but keep in mind you can use it only in certain areas that you struggle with oil, so don't let other reviews about dry skin deter you. With winter coming up I may begin to only use this on my oily areas and another moisturizer on others, but this is literally the holy grail moisturizer for anyone struggling with oily skin. * I have combination skin and this has saved my skin texture and made it so soft. The consistency feels so nice and it's not overly drying even in my dry areas. Feel like it's reduced some redness as well."

However, I don't like the smell, it pills badly and the container is bothersome! I tried using it solo, pilled. Tried laying with other serums and products, pilled even worse. Even started to slightly tingle under my eyes. To note my skin is not sensitive and never reacts to products. * While I do enjoy this cream. I hate the packaging. It's a nice concept but I do not feel that I am getting all the product out of the container. I even tried to open it up but couldn't access the product. Last of product wasted for the price. It is a nice light weight moisturizer. I would buy again if the packaging was different. * If you have sensitive and dry skin, this is a must. I love the bloom pump, the consistency, and the hydration. Wonderful for the winter! * This moisturizer is amazing. Your skin feels softer and it looks radiant and I've noticed a difference right from the first use. This will be my forever moisturizer from now on. * broke my skin out completely within 2 days small bumps/ rash everywhere.

I have oily skin and probably spend upwards of $1K a year on products trying to find things that actually do as they claim, and this is one of them.

I was a little reluctant to purchase this as the price is pretty high for a brand I've never used, but I'm glad that I took the risk on it.  Prior to this moisturizer I was either using none at all (because most others just make me more oily, dont need redundant products on oily skin), or I was using the La-Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Matte one which didn't do much for me. Obviously how this will work for you is going to be different for everyone, and the other products you use prior to your moisturizer will make a difference as well.

For reference I am a 28 yr old female, white/Caucasian.  My morning routine is: wash with a clay based cleanser (Dermalogica), tone (Fenty Skin), hyperpigmentation serum (Good Molecules), niacinamide/zinc serum (Sunday Riley), then this moisturizer. The consistency of this product is great for oil as it is a gel based product, but it comes out more opaque white than clear which is fine. It does not have much of a fragrance that I have noticed, but I'm not sensitive to fragrance so I wouldn't be one to say. When I put this on it almost feels as if it is a crossover between a moisturizer and a makeup primer that blurs your pores.  Now it does not make your pores go away by any means, but it does HELP.  Immediately after applying my skin is definitely mattified but again, not completely shine free as if it is a primer with the sole purpose of making your skin look like it has powder on it. It does not make my skin feel tight and dried out, it genuinely makes me feel moisturized and smooth without the glowy look that normal moisturizers do. From my experience it definitely does not keep me matte for 8 hours, I would say after about 3-4 hours I start to see shine on my face to the point where I feel the need to blot if I were going out somewhere (this is all without wearing makeup or anything on top of my morning skin routine, I work from home).

If you truly have an oily/combo skin type this is not going to be your holy-grail product that makes all of your problems disappear (will continue to search for it), but if it is within your budget for a product of this type then this is 100% top 5 best moisturizers for oily skin on the market right now in my opinion after having used this for a few weeks now.  Would repurchase (and I rarely ever find products I do)!  

I also just want to throw out there that I did buy this on my own, was not asked/paid to write this, and I think this is either my only review I've ever written on Ulta or one of a few over a span of years that I don't even remember. * The packaging is very luxe but the pump feels like its empty and its still half full. It doesn't mattify anything but it is a nice mix of a gel and lotion and a lightweight moisturizer. This is an MLM and I do feel it's overpriced for what it is. It's pretty basic. * Matte effect that works great as a moisturizer/ primer for oily skin types"

Recommend to everyone. * This does not moisturize my face at all, infact my face has been more dry since using. * I have been looking for a good, budget friendly, lightweight moisturizer for years. This is perfect for my combo acne prone skin. I let it soak in for a minute before applying sunscreen and have had no problems with pilling, which I normally do. * It makes my skin feel moisturized it's very light weight I'd recommend using more product depending on how dry your skin is * Especially for the low price point, I think it was definitely worth it. I like to put moisturizer near or around my eyes and most brands stings my eyes if it gets too close, but this one doesnt. it is definitely a lightweight feel. I have skin that becomes very oily very fast and this one doesnt make me feel like that, or sticky like some others do. So i would recommend for sure. * I really like this product.

The new formula is kind of the opposite.
I was excited to try it, because Belif is always so soothing.  This isn't soothing at least not for me. With 30 seconds of putting it on my face, I look like I have very bad sunburn and it feels like I have very bad sunburn.  
I am so bummed - the original was perfect! * This is my holy grail.

But I am utterly disappointed. It caused severe eye irritation that i had to go see an ophthalmologist. No sunscreen has caused me such reaction so i was worreid. However i do think it's a good moistirozer with SPF but its just not for me. * This moisturizer initially feels amazing on the skin, and it worked well under my makeup. However, after a few hours, my eyes began to burn and sting! It happened on 2 separate days so i know that it is this moisturizer. Again, i really wanted to like this but it really irritates my eyes. * This is a really great SPF moisturizer. It really holds up to its name. I've been looking at this brand for months and finally got it. I've only been using this for a little under a week but this by far, has been the best SPF moisturizer I've EVER used. Someone who works at Ulta said this was a really great product; she was correct. What sold me is when she said it holds up really well for people who have oily skin, which is an issue for me so I have an issue with products that make my skin extra oily. This is very lightweight and worth the money. I just need to see how this holds up with this FL heat. * I thought this was the perfrct match for me as i am lazy and hate having to layer moisturizer with an SPF and get greasy quick. This dries down matte at first but within an hour or so is super greasy and makes my face very shiny. For the price I expected better. * I tend to find most sunscreens to be greasy, oily, or sticky even when they claim otherwise. I assumed this would be the same especially since its a sunscreen moisturizer combo. However I was wrong!  The texture and finish is so so lovely. It's very lightweight and glides on nicely, moisturizes without leaving me feeling like a shiny greasy mess! It's perfect under make too. Highly recommend! * It is weightless but it burns yours eyes terribly when you go to take it off ...and it's not sweat proof...for the almost $50 this is I expect more out of a spf moisturizer. There are drugstore brands that can offer the same for a way less price point. Definitely returning. * For some reason, every other facial sunscreen I've tried either made my face red and hot, had a sticky texture, or made my skin bumpy and textured afterwards. This is the only sunscreen without any of these issues! It feels like a regular, lightweight moisturizer in every way, and washes off easily without any texture or stickiness."

On month 3 of using it! * The reviews got me on this one and I decided to give it a try. Spoiler, I regret it so much. This is definitely not for sensitive skin with all of the highly fragrant ingredients in it. I thought my face was purging but after two months, I couldnt take it anymore. Its been 3 months sonce stopping and im still trying to recover from the skin damage it caused. Not all skin types are alike but I think less basic skin care is probably best.

I have sensitive skin and I am also very careful with certain ingredients I use on my skin. This is the best moisturizer, it's hydrating but not greasy and great for day or night. I just mix it with my sunscreen in the morning. * I wanted to love this moisturizer because its clean- I didn't even mind the smell even though some complain about it. But I noticed after several weeks of use, I had many blackheads on my nose and chin. I didn't realize it wasn't non-comedogenic so that was on me for not paying attention. If you have acne or get breakouts, I wouldn't recommend this. * I wish the people who get the products for FREE other wise known as influencers would just be honest. I found it no big deal I've used other products for alot less money, but the 5 ⭐ crews won't be getting free stuff if they don't give a high score. Wait a few weeks to buy it and if you don't like return it, so this is an HONEST review. * Love it!! * I highly recommend this! I kept finding moisturizers that either broke me out or pilled on my face (deal breaker). This one does neither and keeps my face moisturized. It is on the pricey side, but I bought it on sale. The only thing I don't love is the smell. At first it just smells like nothing, but once I rub it in it's almost a chemical smell? Not sure, but I'll take that over not breaking me out. * It goes on like silk and makes your face feel soft and smooth. Feels good after I put on my toner and serums and then it's like a nice after finish. Good smell. Overall the best moisturizer I've used. Somewhere between a gel and a cream"

Really helps to repair my skin barrier and does not feel heavy on the skin at all, very hydrating. * This is my holy grail moisturizer, I use it year long and will never be without it! I have somewhat dry skin that is sensitive and if I use too heavy of a moisturizer I can get those pesky white little balls of grease or bumps. But if I use a very lightweight lotion, it doesn't do enough for my face. So it's always been hard to find the right combination of moisture that it not too heavy. This has a wonderful mild scent, the texture of the cream itself is fabulous and feels luxurious when you use it. It sinks into your skin without leaving it feeling greasy and it has great ingredients too, plus comes in a glass jar. I do wish it was more of a pump or something I didn't have to use my fingers with but it's still totally worth it for me. I am 51 so I am not sure how much it is helping with wrinkles but I think it keeps my skin in great condition and I recommend you try it if you have problems finding the right moisturizer like I did! * leaves my skin super soft and a perfect bouncy yet firm feel to it, has been an absolute game changer for my skincare routine * I've got sensitive, oily/combo skin and nothing has impressed me more than this moisturizer!

A rep for derma told me about this product being used as not only a repairing moisturizer but could be used as a primer as well. Ugh my skin & makeup has never felt so good! * After trying many products, this cream eliminated my dry crusty winter skin. I used it morning and evening, with in one week I noticed a difference. After three weeks my skin was completely restored. * This cream instantly took away my redness and calmed my skin down. My skin was going through havoc so I gave this a try and it was well worth it! Every so often, my skin goes through changes and I rely on this cream to help.  I've bought it 3 times now. * This made me breakout with acne after my face was clear for a very long time. Wanted to love it but cannot. So bummed. I wish I would have read reviewss about causing break outs. Not for me. * It did the exact opposite of what it should've; it actually triggered a major flare up for me :( * I'm very impressed with Dermalogica rapair cream! It has a nice texture and easily abdorbs into my skin. I use it every single day and I can see my skin looks and feels so much better now. I trust this brand and all products I tried have been absolutely wonderful! I highly reccomend trying it! Gifted by Dermalogica. * I purchased this after over-exfoliating. My skin was in pretty bad shape, with some very dry and scaly patches and some oily areas. My skin did improve some, but still had bumps and dry patches after several months of use. I also kept getting acne. I decided to try a different moisturizer and wow, what a dramatic difference and only after a few days. My skin in smooth and supple again!

It was recommended to me because they were out of stock of my go-to product (a different brand). Upon applying a thin layer of Tula 24-7 Weightless Moisture Day & Night Gel Cream to my face and neck, something instantly felt off. The texture was fine so I couldn't place what it was. A minute or so later it started - the slight face burning. Minutes passed and it got to the point I couldn't ignore it and had to wash my face yet again just to get it off! * I received this as a free sample and now I'm hooked. It works so great for my skin. It leaves it refreshed without being heavy. Other moisturizers can be too thick but this is thin and blends perfectly. Worth the purchase! * I started using this moisturizer about one month ago because Tula discontinued my favorite, Super Soothe. I call this a very happy accident, because now my skin is better than ever. Very soft, smooth and moisturized. I'm 64 years old with very sensitive skin - most everything breaks me out. But my skin just drinks this in. It's not sticky, and I don't think my skin has ever been so soft - with zero breakouts. I do always use the Clear It Up toner before I moisturize - I'm sure that helps. * My skin is oily but I still want a plumping hydrating effect as I'm in my late 30s. Most gel moisturizers are too lightweight for me, this one is neither too light or too heavy.  The lactic acid gives a gentle exfoliation so my skin looks more even. * I love the original 24/7 moisturizer but i wanted to try something lighter for under sunscreen in the summer. I felt that this would be the perfect solution. It is light weight, but it doesnt feel like it dries down on my skin and left me feeling very sticky all day. I have combination skin with some dry spots. This felt hydrating enough but I just cant get past how sticky it is, and the smell is a tad unpleasant. I will be sticking with the classic 24/7 moisturizer in the future. * Light, perfect moisturizer for morning & night with all the goodies. No need for extra facial oils. Plus, there are no harsh chemicals."

Its great for sensitive skin that is prone to irritation. Any time I've had skin reactions on my face, this is the product I reach for to help with the itchiness and dryness. It's very hydrating (a bit thicker) while still working well with oily skin. I especially love using this in the colder and drier winter months. * I had high hopes for this product but it caused itching after applying. It also pilled and felt like it left an unpleasant film on my face. After three days I developed a few breakouts and clogged pores. It's poorly formulated. * Too harsh on my skin * But unfortunately it doesn't work well for me. I haven't found a moisturizer that doesn't cause my face to turn red and feel hot to the touch * I use this as a night time moisturizer during warm weather. I started using this when I had a really bad rash and acne on my face due to over washing and high humid whether. It kept my skin moisturizered while it healed and did not cause more skin issues.
Pros: light, moisturizing, good for my sensitive skin, no smell, does the job in spring and summer months when humidity and heat is high 
Cons: too light for cold months, small amount for the amount you get and the cost but it does last for a season or so * Even with 30 per cent discount, way too expensive, especially for cost.  Many less expensive, just as effective alternatives."

I love what retinol does for the skin! * This is my first retinol at 35. Ive only used it for 2 weeks everynight and my skin texture is so smooth and glowing. Big improvement and safe to use daily with a good moisterizer and gentle care. Also I use spf 50 during the day because I hear it can make your skin more sensitive! * I used this retinol cream for over a year with no issue (i slowly worked my way to more regular use) year 2 of using, randomly broke me out terribly & ruined my skins barrier. I cant express how much i wish i hadnt used this product, my skin has finally recovered, but it took almost 6 months to heal fully. (Even after removing all actives) i used have cystic acne, and this did help me initially but the cons have majorly outweighed the pros. * The price point is what got me to buy it originally. I've only been using it for two weeks and I can tell my skin is noticeably firmer and my acne improved. I'm sure it'll take several months to notice the fine lines improving but that's okay! Good things take time. Thank you so much for making a good, affordable retinol product! * I have oily, acne prone skin and this product has done wonders at stopping my hormonal acne! A must try for beginners trying out retinol ! * I really am starting to like this! My acne is really bad right now, like deep blind-head cysts, and this has helped to bring it up to the surface and disappear. It might seem like its breaking you out at first— it technically isnt. its just bringing existing pimples to the surface, and after, they will go away. For me I needed that because my acne is stubborn and deeply embedded in my skin. I could already see improvement within the first week. It is very silky and smooth, not greasy, and gently moisturizing. Its not recommended to add a moisturizer on top of retinol serum, but I add some squalane oil after applying to bring back some natural moisture because it can be drying. Make sure you only use a dime size amount and apply thinly to your whole face, and do NOT use every day. DO NOT combine other acne treatments with it, like salycilic acid/benzoyl peroxide, or AHA/PHA exfoliants. you will get a burn!!! I use only 3-4x a week. AND FYI… this is a TOTAL dupe for FAB cosmetic's retinol serum which is like $50 :/ So this should be your first pick, especially if you are a beginner in using retinol, and or want to save money! * I have super oily skin and have never had an issues with dryness. I have been using the same skincare regimen for years and my skin finally needed a change so i bough the light weight mositurizer, milky toner, gentle retinol, yerba mate eye cream, and hydrating gel cleaners, and zinc SPF. I use the cleaner and moisturizer daily and alternate the toner/retinol using them once every few days. I have been using these products for about a week and i have chemical burns on my face and sever dryness on my forehead and cheeks causing my skin to peel. I was excited to find this brand because it was affordable and clean jngredients but now i have to return it all and get a new brand"

Only downside is that this is expensive so I will wait for coupons/sales in order to repurchase. * Love the product.

Nothing worked until I found this!!  It may seem a little pricey but it actually works and it lasts a long time. One pump is enough to cover my face and neck. I won't do without this and hope they don't change the formula or discontinue it!! * This is an excellent cream to use during the harsh winter months in Chicago. My skin looks and feels so hydrated! Also love that it dispenses the correct amount to ise on your face! * Love Dermalogica, but this is a huge miss. Very thick and sticky - it's like putting heavy sunscreen on your face. You can't put this on then go straight to bed as your face sticks to your pillow. This stickiness also feels itchy.

If I would itch it would leave scratch welts all over my face (what it looks like when a dog jumps up and scratches you is the best way to describe it), followed by an itchy sensation from my head to my toes. Once I would itch I would get little hive bumps and the scratch welts all over my body. Very sad this product did not work out for me, but wanted to warn others that have sensitive skin. * This moisturizer is very thick and seems to be a great product with the exception of the smell. It is a vibrant apple/lemon like a candy. 
Reminds me of a teenage type product, unfortunately it is to potent to use at night, to try to fall asleep it just keeps me up. * I love both the day and night moisturizer. The day is light and great under makeup, the night is thicker and really hydrates my skin. They also smell great!"

I was really excited to try this:/ * This is one of the best moisturizers I have used. I use tretinion as my retinol and it tends to make my skin dry and flaky. I don't have that issue using this product. I see a lot of people complain about the strong rose scent. It think its delightful and doesn't linger too long but you have to understand what the product is derived from which rose petals snd buds. I use it day and night it I have seen improvements in my skin texture. * Got this on sale to try out some other moisturizer options (go-to is Peach&Lily matcha pudding). The texture is wonderful, and I do think it helped with my dry/sensitive skin, but I am not personally a huge fan of the strong fragrance. * i loved this moisturizer until i realized it wasnt cruelty free… a very nice subtle rose scent that i loved. sad i have to discontinue using this moisturizer. * Fresh has won me over with yet another great product! I bought the mini size initially but ordered the full size within a couple days because it's truly amazing. 

The moisturizer is pretty thick yet still absorbs quickly, leaving my skin dewy and soft. I use a retinol that leaves my face prone to dryness but not since switching to Fresh! The light rose smell is a delightful bonus too! * I love this moisturizer. It's light and works great. Smells amazing too. * I love this cream. Despite tbe bery heavy rose scent, it's hydrating & soothing for dry skin. I have dry skin & a midly oily nose area. I recommend washing the face with an unscented clear facesoap, patting dry with a face or other towel & applying immediately. I noticed better results when applying after washing/cleansing my face. This is great for mornings & even mid-day if you wash your face after sweating. 
If the scent is too much for the daytime, consider using it at night on top of a light serum. Be careful, it contains Hyaluronic Acid & irritated my skin when I accidentally used it on top of another serum with the same ingredient. (Avoid any acidic serums, just in case.) I have melanated skin with no wrinkles or fine lines, but I do have hyperpigmentation from some acne scars. It works great for me, despite my sensitive skin.
CONS: I dont like the way liquid foundation blends on top. I only use MAC, so I'm unsure how it sits underneath other brands. 
Enjoy! It is pricey, so def use your points!"

Lovely sunscreen :) Thank you so much Lancome ! * this is product is heavenly only downside is the price! * I wish for the money this cost that it wikld have more product. * Let me start by saying the formula itself is beautiful: lightweight, offers a healthy glow without looking greasy, smooths out texture, and plays nicely with my sensitive/rosacea-prone skin. I should be a big fan BUT…

Why the heck does it smell like tires??! I've had it on for ~3 hrs and the rubbery smell still lingers. Hard pass! * was given a sample after applying my eyes began to water and burn. product dropped on the area between my nose and eye and blistered it... * I was little hesitant about using this product given that it's also a primer and I didn't have the best of luck with the Live Tinted brand spf moisturizer + primer but this stuff is great!

It also caused my make up to separate even when allowing 15 minutes to dry before applying foundation. I've increased my moisturizer usage hoping that would help offset the dryness, but it has not helped at all. This sunscreen has an odd smell to it. * I've had such a hard time finding a face sunscreen that didnt mess with my skin or makeup and this is it! I'm obsessed with how easy it is to apply after my skincare and it was no issue at all with my makeup after application! It doesn't have a typical sunscreen smell. I will say, for someone like myself who had oily combo skin, this might be a hit or miss for you, but for myself personally I didn't mind it at all :) * My sister-in-law got this and I've always wanted to try it and have it my own and I love it 😊 * Smells terrible and goes on like flaky paste. Overall gross feeling. Very dissatisfied. * I've tried countless sunblocks, most of which caused me breakouts and I usually hate the way they feel on my skin or smell. This one is my GOAT. It layers well over my other skincare and makes a great primer for makeup. I always repurchase this. * I've lived an active outdoorsy lifestyle for many years and I have tried many sunblocks. I bought this on a whim and I'm so glad that I did! I use it everyday either on its own or under my makeup. I have light, sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. This product blends well over my other skincare and doesn't feel heavy. Its also beautiful under makeup. I'll keep repurchasing. * Took me a bit to get used to this product esp after using city block spf 40, but is now a staple in my everyday morning routine. It blends really nice into the skin after warming the product up with my fingertips. Thats the key is warming the prodcut up in your hands. I love how it has just a little tint to bring down redness; with a little concealer and transparency powder on top, it creates a beautiful finish!"

It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.

It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy! * I can't believe it took me so long to find this amazing product. I will have it a part of my skin routine forever now! Such a great lotion for my whole body. Highly recommend purchasing if you have dry and sensitive skin. Game changing product so excited I found it! * As someone with dry and flaky skin, I've tried countless lotions over the years, but none have worked as effectively as this one.

It only lasted 5 months with only using it once a day and using the small scooper provided * Used every ounce of it. Loved the texture and feel on my skin. 
A bit pricey. 
Would buy again in a heartbeat. * Received the trial size in the daytime sample kit. Love Sunday Riley products, but not a fan of this moisturizer. I do not mind the smell, as others do, but the product does not absorb. Instead, it pills. Don't want to waste it so I use it on days when I'm not wearing makeup or anything on top. * I just started my second jar of C.E.O. Afterglow Cream. Although it is pricier than what I was using before, it lasted almost five months, which is awesome especially since I use it on my face and my neck.. I was using a different brand's vitamin C moisturizers and this one blows that one out of the water. Personally I really like the scent. It smells citrusy. It is so smooth to put on, and dries quickly. A little goes a long way. I get monthly facials, and my esthetician commented how my pores have gotten smaller, my skin remains smooth, and the color itself is really consistent. I also really appreciate that this product comes in glass instead of plastic. * I love my skin now * I've been using this for a few weeks. The smell is terrible, very chemical. The texture of the cream is light, but applies very oily on my skin. I have not noticed any difference in my skin. * I would recommend this but if u have combo or oily skin be advised that it caused a slight irritation on my at times oily chin. but so dewy and long lasting it may take a little getting used to. overall pleased"

I tried this one as a sample ulta sent me and immediately repurchased. Im on my 4th one from the last 8 months so my only complaint is i wish they sold a larger size. A staple in my skin care!!!! * This used to be my holy grail PM moisturizer until they reformulated. My new container of this burns my skin and gave me an eczema flare up around my mouth and eyes. I'm so disappointed in this because I loved it and would have continued to pay the expensive price for such a good moisturizer. The plain CeraVe has worked better than this, which is so frustrating when this was my FAVORITE. Please go back to the original formula. If I'm going to pay this much for a moisturizer, I want quality ingredients. * I live in a very dry area in oregon and this moisturizer is so great for dry skin absolutely love! * I had high hopes for this but after applying it, I immediately noticed that my hands felt sticky/tacky. I also noticed the feeling on my face as well. * I absolutely looooooovvveee this moisturizer! I used to use the Neutrogena Hydroboost moisturizer in high school/college and I had no what my skin was really needing. As soon as I tried this a couple years ago, I immediately knew I would love it. I've tried to find cheaper alternatives and even another high-end brand, but I always regret it and can't wait to repurchase this one. It works really well under makeup and doesn't make my face feel greasy. As much as I've tried, I can't let go of this moisturizer! * This moisturizer is the best I have ever used.

It doesn't feel the same.  It's greasy and pasty.  After applying makeup, my skin was shiny and oily!

I'm 29 and was recommended by an Ulta employee in the store the lifting face + neck cream. The cream is a completely new product. It is thicker, much firmer texture than the old one. It is also bright white. It does not have a noticeable fragrance. (The jar says fragrance free). I use it as a night cream and can definitely see and feel the difference in 'firmness' and 'lifting' in my neck; although I didn't think I really needed it and that wasn't why I used the original night cream. I have noticed some white heads in my forehead/T-Zone, but I tend to get them occasionally anyway so I can't blame the cream on it. After reading about the other variations, I wish I had the SPF version so I can try wearing it twice a day with my makeup over it. I'll be giving this one to my mom and trying the SPF one next. :) * This is returnef the plumpness to my cheeks has lifted my laugh lines and I don't look as sallow under my eyes. This cream is amazing I thought I needed a facelift but after using this clinically proven product were 100% of women saw results I'm in love. I've never had more compliments on my skin and I'm 62. * Been using new product for 3 weeks, so far not real happy also higher price . * I love this face and neck cream.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.  I like that I can also use for my neck. * My face and neck are covered in red glitter after using this. If I wanted glitter all over my face and neck I'd buy a product specifically for that. It is not clear on the package unless you scrutinize the ingredients. It's mica on the ingredients * This is a great moisturizer and plumper!  I will continue to purchase this * More than satisfied with this product and I've tried a lot of products."

I thought it would be okay to use on my face even though I have ""normal"" skin because this is a product for ""sensitive"" skin, meaning it would be okay for any skin type (so I thought). I broke out after 2 days of using it. I don't normally breakout, so when a whole patch of zits popped up on both my cheeks and forehead, I was so confused. I stopped using it 
after another day because I knew nothing else I was using caused this since everything I normally use hasn't caused this reaction. After about 3 or 4 days, everything cleared up and I am now going to return this. Lesson I took away from this, don't buy everything you see someone asvertising on tiktok! * I was influenced from tiktok and was so excited to not spend so much money on skincare, but this left me with the worst acne I've ever had in my life. I recently saw something that said it clogs pores and I can't use it on my face anymore. * Got this product after seeing it listed as a good option for people with sensitive skin who are acne prone a few times online, plus I needed a thicker, unscented moisturizer for my night routine. Ordered it and prayed this stuff wasn't going to instantly upset my skin (products that don't agree with me tend to give me breakouts and irritate/burn my skin). Good news for me - I didn't seem to have any of those feared reactions. While this product is definitely on the thicker side, you don't need very much of it and you get a decent amount of product for the price. I still haven't finished my first bottle, but I'm happy to report that in the last 2 months of using it daily, my skin feels more hydrated, doesn't seem to be causing me any extra breakouts, and I wake up with soft, nourished skin (or at least, that's what it feels like). If you're a sensitive skin girl or guy, this one might be worth a try. * This is the only moisturizer I will use for my face. I have always suffered from severely dry skin and this stuff has made my skin feel and look amazing! I love applying this at nighttime after all of my other skincare products. You do have to be careful with the amount you use, because this stuff is thick!! Being as you only have to use a little of the product, the amount you get in this container is more than enough to last you at least a year (if only using on your face). I would however only recommend this at night and not under makeup. I feel like it is too heavy of a moisturizer to sit well under makeup. * This product is advertised as clean but the 2nd ingredient is petrolatum!! That is infuriating when people who care and/or have health issues & concerns. I've had people argue with me in the past that there's ""nothing wrong with petrolatum"" and even ""it's healthy""! To those people I encourage you to look it up & let that sink in!.Seriously, I'm not asking you to - gasp - read a book, but Google this nasty stuff! ok * I was hesitant to use this on my face as it has a really thick consistentcy but I decided to give it a try. I have acne prone skin and this moisturizer did not break me out at all. I now use it every night as part of my skin care routine. It does a great job of moisturizing especially in the dry winter months."

I like its smoothness which leaves my skin feeling soft. I also like the sunscreen it provides. * I have very dry skin & this day time cream seems to hydrate all day long, * Love it worked great for me helped with my lines so light weight being with anti-aging ingredients love it has spf 30 * This product is so smooth going on & I love the smell. I've been using it since I bought it & can see the difference it has made. * Like others have shared, this did not work for sensitive skin. I've given it a try for a few weeks to see if it was a temporary reaction, but no improvements. It makes my skin red and blotchy and fine lines look much more severe. My skin itches and burns as well. * Clinique really missed the mark with this one. For reference I have normal skin, 42, don't wear makeup. 
Great SPF, feels fine going on but once you start rubbing/massaging into the skin - white swathes cling to dry patches and remain white all day. Over rubbing causes this to pill. Anything applied underneath it causes this to pill. Touching your face causes this to pill. Fabric touching your cheeks causes this to pill. You will look like a crusty pale mess all day long = worthless."

Even in winter. * Provided adequate moisture to under eye area and to whole face * This product is amazing. (Unlike their under eye one). Skin is noticeably smoother. * So rich and smooth * I very seldom post any reviews but this product deserves all the credits.  I am post menopausal and dont enjoy makeup or lots of products on my skin and had not found any other product that would absorb quickly and show immediate relief to the dryness on my face. I have now used this product for over a year (got a sample from ulta which is why I tried it in the first place) and I absolutely love it.  People often ask me what have I done to my face because of less noticeable wrinkles and the skin looks supple. I hope they never change this product because it is just perfect. * I loved the way this felt but it gave me a very bad allergic reaction. I went online and found out there's many other people who experienced this too. So be aware! * Does not set well with foundation. Too sticky.

I have tried so many of their products and this one is a hit! Its not heavy or greasy. I love the sunscreen version since im lazy in the mornings. I have dryer skin and this doesnt burn or sting my face or eyes. A little bit goes a long way and its a amazing value!! * This is such a great product. I have sensitive skin, and it doesn't break me out. In addition, it feels light weight and goes great under makeup. * this is the second elf sunscreen that has horribly burned my eyes. it sucks because the formulation is great. I spent about 2 1/2 hours with burning eyes even rinsing it was still so bad. * This product is light, my make up looks great plus it smells delightful! * Have bought this product three times and all three times the lid cracked broke apart,  fell down into the product and I had to fish part of the plastic white lid out of already white facial cream. And then no way to seal the product.  This has become a big problem.  I won't be buying this anymore even though it is a good product.  Fix the dang packaging. * I am loyal elf fan and finally bought this. This cream does not sting my eyes, hydrates and softens my skin. It does not smell like sunscreen. My makeup goes on smooth and my face is soft and hydrated all day. 
I also use the Holy Hydration cream at night and the eye cream under makeup.  I would definitely recommend this. I love elf and I  am a long time user of their products. All I can say is Holy greatness. * I'm happy with the face cream over all. Love the SPF protection, consistency and texture of the product and how it sits on my skin. I have made multiple purchases of this and other face creams from E.L.F. and enjoy them immensely.  Unfortunately, 3 out of the past 5 purchases of this product have had the issue of the lid degrading and breaking off sharp shards of plastic into and around the product itself. It seems to only be the white plastic lid and subsequent liner of the jar that I take issue with. This evening I went to apply the product and as I was grasping the lid to open it, a large plastic shard splintered off from the lid and stabbed my finger. Luckily I was able to grasp it with tweezers and stop the bleeding quickly. I hope this is something that can be taken care of soon as I would hate to have to ditch this great product out of safely concerns."

I used it at night. My issue is it doesnt seem to absorb into the skin, just my pillow case. I much prefer the birch sap moisturizer over this one. I will use it but wouldnt purchase again. * I LOVE this moisturizer. I have dry skin. My skin soaks it up and it is my go to nighttime moisturizer. Every person I have recommended it to has loved it as well. The ONLY con is that it has pilled under my makeup before which is why I only use it at night. If you are not someone who wears makeup you will not have this problem!! * This moistureizer is amazing on its own, but if you have eczema I recommend mixing it with the advanced snail 96 mucin power essence!! Its a beautiful combonation!! Has definitely helped with my rough patches! * I love that it isn't viral so its always in stock. Amazing moisturizer especially during the winter * I love this product!! I have very dry skin and it helps so much. I does take a longer than normal time to absorb but i still love it! Legit my holy grail product. * I use a prescription retinol so i don't need anything extra from my night cream.  This product is thick and luxurious feeling without breaking the bank! I think it's a little too thick for me for a day cream (I also live in a humid area), but it's perfect for nighttime. I use the CosRX snail mucin with a cold quartz roller, then my retinol, then this. * Ive been struggling with eczema my whole life. Ive used so many different moisturizers so much money wasted but this product has really helped me im on my second jar and its helped me so much if gou have eczema give it a try I highly recommend this for everyone especially my folks with very sensitive skin"

I prefer it to using steroids or other topical prescriptions whenever possible.  Great product. * Super expensive… but this is the only lotion that doesnt cause breakouts on my back and I actually notice the amount of back breakouts have lessened when i use this. 
Makes my skin feel really soft instead of just coated. * I could have sworn I remembered this being a holy grail product for the acne on my back and shoulders, and I also remembered it being significantly less expensive than it is now. Now, it contains mineral oil and has done nothing to help my body breakouts - in fact I feel more greasy and more broken out than before! Works okay for other parts of my body less prone to acne (like fighting ingrown hairs on legs, etc) but it's just too expensive for the ingredients list now. * It truly, magically removes the bumps after a few applications. * Definitely made my bumpy skin smooth but it has parabens :( I wont be buying this again * I'm super disappointed with this product and also shocked at all of the good reviews. This comes highly recommended by dermatologists and I was excited to try it. I have KP as well as psoriasis and this lotion made both WORSE. I wish I was joking. Immediately after putting this on, my skin would feel dryer and I thought I was just being crazy. But after 1 whole month of using this after every shower I can confidently say that this did not work for me. My skin is drier, my KP is worse; I've literally never had this many bumps on my arms before, and my psoriasis patches are even more irritated. Honestly super upsetting."

If you don't wait to apply your make up until the spf dries a bit, it ends up rolling together and making patches with your makeup. If you do wait, I personally feel the results are worth it - very smooth application and it looks nice all day. * Excellent cream to prevent shine for those special occasions or photo shoots. A staple in my makeup kit. * Im not sure why this SPF has so many bad reviews. I honestly love it for my oily skin. Ive tried so many sunscreens on the market and nothing compair to this one. This doesnt give me that super dewy look or makes me oily. Never going back this is my holy grail sunscreen! * I have been using it for 5 years and I love it. My skin is very oily and this product mattifies my skin, minimizes my pores and serves as a primer for my makeup. I truly love it. * This lightweight moisturizer is a great multitasker! It blends quickly with no white cast while also offering spf 45. Wven better it provides a smooth canvas for your makeup. Makes skin look poreless and controls oil all day long. I have noticeable pores on my cheeks and this smoothed that area out beautifully all day. This combines multiple products into one: moisturizer, primer, and spf. If you're on the fence just get it! I was gifted this product by Murad in exchange for my honest thoughts and review. * It's simply perfect for the oily face

Leaves your skin looking shiny all day. I have oily skin so while using this I had lots of breakouts. Do not recommend if you have oily skin. Super disappointed! * I have severely dry skin like I drink enough water so I was trying to find a product that would actually make me feel hydrated on the surface of my skin. Phytoceramides is the only ingredient that actually makes me feel hydrated on the top. I know other moisturizers that do it's job under the surface but sadly my skin doesn't really feel it. I will say this is more of a night time moisturizer. As for makeup I just usually put a thin layer of aquaphor under my makeup and it does the job. I recommend this to anyone who needs surface hydration on their skin. * This product is so thick and oily. I feel like it did make my skin feel moisturized, but it broke my skin out sooo bad and I usually don't break out!! * This product is so sticky that it feels like you're applying glue to your skin. It's so thick that it leaves an oily shine on your skin for hours after application. If I want to apply makeup after this moisturizer, I have to blot off the oil with a tissue. After using this for 15 days, I had many clogged pores, bumps, and acne. I have dry sensitive skin and although it did make my skin hydrated (I think), there are significantly more negative things this product did that made my skin worse. The Ordinary is known for its amazing formulas and clean ingredients, and this moisturizer missed the mark on both. * Ive used jergens for so long but i got this and omgggg its so soft it really does its job didnt irritate my skin theres no smells to it and a little goes a long way * After using it for a week I can totally see the difference in my complexion. * i love this moisturizer so much. but people with oily skin mught not. this moisturizer is meant for dry skin. so if you have super oily skin i would not buy this. but if you have dry skin, this is the best hydrating moisturizer!"

The more I use it the more I like it. I think its a great morning cream and it rivals the Estee Lauder Revitalizing Youth cream. It does well under makeup. Its also good for my dry skin without it being too oily for day time. I would like to try the one with SPF. * I bought this during the sale at 50% off. I think its a perfect cream for dry or combo skin. It doesn't leave my skin too greasy, but rather hydrated. * I recieved a little sample packet of this cream in an order. My skin isn't very sensitive, so I always try out samples. Nice way to discover new products!

After using this product, I had to double check to make sure I wasn't using a cream cleanser. The frangrance threw me off; It smells heavily of soap to me. Like bar soap. I wouldn't perchance this for myself, because I feel like I need to rinse off. However, I love the consistency and would like it very much if it didnt have that soapy smell. :/ * I want to love it bevause its so moisturizing but its very heavily perfumed and makes me breakout * As a person with ""mature"" skin I am happy to revisit this product. I tried it several years ago and it was too much for my skin but these days it is perfect. It's works well under make up and I also use it at night over serums. * I originally purchased the eye cream when Ulta had it on a sale. Then the wrinkle cream came at a great price… I have been using this product now for a couple of weeks and it makes my skin so smooth and soft, and I can see wrinkles diminishing, this is a wonderful product! * Makes skin feel like butter….

I'm 39 and have a history of cystic acne and plenty of sun damage from my childhood, so my skin is usually acne-prone and the weird combo of super flaky but also oily. This mask makes my skin feel super hydrated and doesn't irritate it at all. I also don't usually like things touching my face at night, but once this mask js on I don't even notice it's there. I've seen other reviews mentioning the smell, but I haven't really noticed much of a smell and I'm pretty sensitive to fragrances. If you want an affordable but effective gentle product, this is a great choice. * I really wanted to like this product due to its affordability and that is it formulated for sensitive skin but this product caused me to get small bumps all over my face and neck. Almost as if it clogged my pores. I used it for 8 weeks and as soon as I stopped, the bumps went away * it broke out my skibiti skin… rawr * this pruduct made my skin so soft and hydrated I love this and can't recommend it enough! * I love this sleep mask!

I continue to use it since it keeps white heads away and oiliness at bay. * Love the way it leaves my skin feeling.  I wasn't going to try but had to check it out.  And it was definitely worth my gold coins. * Smaller than the free samples it came with * It is a strong product that must be used as directed. If used properly it will reveal a brighter, better looking skin. * No negative side effects even using it overnight. But I noticed absolutely no difference in my skin after 2 months. It's way too expensive to not show any improvements. * I love this product (this skincare line period). I havent been dissatisfied yet but im always sad when my bottle runs out. My only con is that its pricey but I feel like its worth it and my skin agrees. If I could only afford one thing I would hands down buy this. I recommend using at night because its not really all that lightweight but doesnt cause me to breakout. I can also mix with moisturizer from the same brand (or different) and it does not affect the performance * This retinol does work.  I tried others that I have been recommended and it has just been a waste of resources.  I come back this one which do show results in one day.  I can see my skin fresh and renewed.

Save your money!! * The tackiness goes away after awhile. Despite that, I love it! It also helped clear out my skin! * I have been using this product every morning for almost a month now and i can say i have seen some brightness of my skin hyperpigmentation i always make sure to follow up with a sunscreen so thats i can see results faster so far so good 👍🏽 * Yes yes yes!! So many pros and positives to this, I use it AM and PM. Love it so much! * I love all of Dermalogica products. This is like a mix of a cream serum compound to me but a cream texture. I have a tiny face and it takes two pumps to get the adequate amount I need for my face and neck. It dries on the skin very quickly but not dries like you cant feel it, dries like you can't spread it. So you have to get it everywhere you want quickly. Then it is very tacky so it should be the last thing you apply. If you apply anything afterwards you will get pilling. All that being said it does wonders for my skin. Leaves my skin glowing and fresh after i use it. It plumps it up and helps my pores as well skin texture. Its an amazing vitC face product. I find it hard to fall in love with vitC skincare products but always want to have one in my regimen. This has been the only one that truly does everything it promises to do. It does have some cons but i just dont use it on days I'm planning on wearing makeup. If you are a daily makeup wearer id recommend using it either hours before or in the evening. You get a good amount for the price. Its got a nice dispenser. Overall i give 5 stars cause not everything can be completely perfect in every aspect but if you get what you want from it can you really be upset. * It does not feel weightless.

It absorbs well, softens skin, and doesnt leave skin greasy or tacky. I would buy a big bottle of this. I wish it werent so expensive. * I was looking for something that might be better than the Cerave lotion I was using for a long time that had parabens in it. My skin is sensitive and lots of things tend to irritate or break me out. Nothing changed but this lotion. I don't know what's in it that did it, but I immediately started breaking out. It claims to be for sensitive skin, but I'll take the parabens over that. And they've recently taken them out. So I won't be using this lotion. * This is not gentle whatsover!!! It smells like paint thinner and Shea butter not in a good way either.. I was lit up like a red tomatoe.. horrible horrible .. stay away its not for sensitive skin.. adding cheap ingredients and hiking up prices is what most everyone is doing now days.  Nothing is of any quality only for profits.  It's already a super small bottle for a high price tag now its not even worth using if it manages the barrier too.. ughhh * I have severe rosacea and am on the hunt for an affordable moisturizer.  I currently use environ super moisturiser but it is costly. 
I bought this La Roche posay moisturizer and it burned immediately. 
my skin is still recovering as this caused my rosacea to flare up.
I guess I'm still searching for my perfect affordable moisturizer. * Literally the only moisturizer that has put my rosacea at ease. Only downside is it is quite expensive for such a small bottle. * I have dry skin that can be sensitive to ingredients in moisturizers. I use two pumps of this on my face, twice a day after cleansing and serum. I apply serum to damp skin, let it soak in, then apply the moisturizer. Out of several sensitive skin moisturizers I tried so far, this is the only one that never makes me itchy or red. My skin is less flaky and inflamed than usual this winter so I think this is working for me and I will repurchase. It seems to layer well with other products and makeup."

I have very sensitive skin so I've given it three days between uses. I usually put it on right before bed but tonight I had a couple hours and touched my face and this stuff pills like crazy. That's my only complaint, though * I wanted to love this,  but the chemical smell i can't do. Also, i dont like the fact its recommended to use at night only. I want a moisturizer that works for both day and night personally. Going back to true belief aqua bomb. * I usually don't leave reviews, but this cream is everything! I've been using it for several months now but I noticed a difference in my skin within the same week. I have very oily VERY acne prone skin with some scarring, and since I've been using this cream I've had minimal break outs which is a huge deal for me. I alternate it with Dime's blue facial oil and my skin has seriously never looked this good. I can't rave about this product and Dime skincare enough, this cream is a must-have!!! * Ulta gifted me this cream and i have to say im impressed!! Ive mever even heard of the brand before and it works soo amazing and feels luxurious!!! I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin. Its plump and very hydrated. * Don't think about it, just buy it. Oily skin friendly! * Finding a product like foundation or cream that doesnt irritate my skin (i have sensitive dry skin, psoriasis, eczema, acne) is a nightmare.

I dont use it everyday because of it which is ashame because of the price. * I received a Clarins set as a bonus with purchase.  I first tried this products.  The fragtance is so strong snd overwhelming thst my eyes became irritated.  I am not usually sensitive to anything.  Clarins, you do. It beed to add this much fragrance.

No white cast, doesn't slip around/get in eyes, etc. It prevents hyperpigmentation very effectively. Long story short, best sunscreen I have ever used. * I like to travel with this sunscreen. It works to protect my whole body.  Excellent. * I was excited to use this because the ingredients looked good and it had good reviews but it did not work to protect my or my family's skin.  I have spent full days at the lake and used other products without a problem but this, over just a couple hours and with multiple applications I still got burned. We ended up switching back to our regular lotion and got some relief later but I am truly disappointed and my skin is paying the price and looks very damaged and bright red. I would caution everyone to bring a backup lotion if they try this. * I never write reviews, but this is truly one of the best beauty products I've ever added to my routine. I have very dry skin and this keeps me so glowy and just makes my skin look so healthy. I can definitely see it in my skin when I'm not using it. It has improved the look of my skin over time as well it's always so soft and it helps to calm down my redness. BUY THIS !!! * I love all other supergoop products, however this one smelt like mosquito spray to me & left me very oily. I will be returning this item unfortunately. * I was surprised at how incredible it makes my skin look. On top of providing protection. During heat waves (like right now) it does make my skin look oily and bloated — so i use another brand instead"

And you know what? This moisturizer surpassed my expectations. I am a 25 year old female who randomly started getting bad acne on my forehead. I am also a student again so I needed to let go of my expensive products for now. I found that this moisturizer is actually good and does not cause any extra acne while also being hydrating. Under make up, it preforms well and is maybe just a little oily but that also might just be my face. Anyway, for the price it wouldnt hurt to try out. 
Note: I'm not a huge fan of the container situation. It makes it seem like a body lotion or something. BUT it does not affect the product itself. * Love this non comunigenic, cheap, mostiurizer.

So, I very rarely write reviews but this product deserves one. I've been using this product for a little over a week now and it's saved my skin. A little bit about me and my skin concerns: I'm 38, latina with tan skin, no wrinkles but a few fine lines around the corners of my lips. I struggle with eczema on my eyebrows, around my nose and chin. When I started using this cream, I had been dealing with a flare up that was into its 2nd week. 😫 I applied this the same night that I picked it up. Immediately, I noticed the lemony scent and silky feel on my skin. I had no stinging or burning. The next morning, MY FACE WAS CLEAR. No patches, no angry flare up. My skin was glowing and supple. It's been very hot in NJ and I've even used this twice a day with no adverse reaction. My skin looks so much better and that makes me happy. Thank you fresh for this amazing product. I love it. 🩷 * I really wanted to like this, as I tried the lotus day cream in the past and loved it! This time, I got this in the gift set from Ulta (the one you get with minimum purchase), and I am happy I didn't purchase the full size. The cream has a nice texture and smell but it made me break out terribly!!! I definitely wouldn't recommend to sensitive acne prone skin people. Very disappointing. * I have years using this cream. Ordered new one, when I applied it I did noticed the smell was different, I thought was expired. Looks like lots of customers are complaining about a formula changed ? So sad, now I have to find a replacement brand. * This became my new favorite lotion so quick! Super moisturizing but feels light still. Has the best smell ever (not too strong). Highly recommend! * i made the mistake of not doing a patch test. my face broke out from this really bad. it also has a weird strong fruity fragrance?? * Personally its clogging for me. My skin doesnt react to dimethicone well in larger quantities. Been loving this as an eye cream though, the antioxidants and skin firming has been a pro in the morning. * This lotion is lightweight yet keeps my face moisturized all day long. It does well under makeup. The packaging is elegant and a little goes a long ways. I will be repurchasing"

I use everything Dermalogica and constantly get compliments on my skin. * This is one of those products that's been life changing in my routine. The way my under eyes look & feels from this product is phenomenal. This has helped with my fine lines and wrinkles. Helped firm my under eyes. Super rich lux formula. A little goes a long way. It awakens my under eyes. * I need moisture, not grease.  So sad. I will be going back to my Drunk Elephant. * Oooof..big fan of Dermalogica but not of this. Leaves an awful oily residue and film on skin; running, not walking to return. * Does not absorb well. Face remains shiny and the product just sits on your skin. I did not see a reduction in wrinkles and I used it for almost 3 months 2x/day. * I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review~

Absolutely fantastic! I've been using this dual-phase anti-aging firming serum for a few weeks now and I'm truly impressed. The combination of CAMU CAMU, hyaluronic acid, and green coffee bean extract has worked wonders on my skin. Not only does it feel firmer, but the fine lines and wrinkles are noticeably reduced. The texture is light and non-greasy, making it a pleasure to use. I highly recommend this serum to anyone looking for an effective anti-aging solution. * Dermalogica phyto nature firming serum has a lot of powerful ingredients to make this serum amazing for fine lines and wrinkles. This firms up my skin and gives it an overall better texture. It gives my skin a more healthy appearance and I look forward to applying this in the morning and at night. gifted by dermalogica"

This moisturizer helps keep the dryness moisturized and the oily parts much less oily. My skin even got a little too dry, which was a first for me. I just added a nighttime super moisturizer to balance it out. Only needed to do that for 2-3 days and I was back in business. I just purchased the oil control version from the same brand. Hoping to love it, too. This is great for a summertime moisturizer, but maybe not so great for the dry winters here in the dry desert. Great price for how much product you get. Using every morning and I'm still on my first bottle which I've been using for about 4 months. Probably have at least another month worth to go before it goes empty.  A little goes a long way. If you're on the fence, just try it! You won't regret it. * My derm has prescribed a lotion that I need extra moisture while using it. I did my normal routine but I used this lotion to lock in the moisture. Unfortunately I've woken up to red irritated skin this did not help at all. If you have dry skin I do not recommend this at all. * My skincare routine is rather simple, but includes active ingredients for acne that can be drying. My usual moisturizer (good molecules) was out of stock so i grabbed this hoping the lightweight, oil free formula wouldnt trigger breakouts. The texture was great, not greasy, no clogged pores. But it just couldnt bring the hydration back to my face after using those acne products. I gave it a few weeks then exchanged for my usual moisturizer. Im sure this product works well when your regiment doesnt include drying ingredients, but otherwise, look elsewhere. * Been using for about a month. Im not sure if its causing my breakouts but i am having terrible breakouts on my cheeks, which is pretty unusual for me. 

The formula is so watery and it doesnt feel nice putting it on my skin. Also smells very chemically. * I have extremely sensitive skin .  This has stop so many dry spots and patches ! * Well first time impression i loved this. Its lightweight. Feels good on the skin. Doesnt feel greasy or heavy. To the cons. It broke me out. I got red dots and acne. Turns out snail mucin doesnt work well for my skin. I have combo oily. * For someone with severaly oily skin, this may be for you.

-a faithful customer- * I tend to avoid creams that have fragrence in this and this one tends to sting over cuts & dry skin in very fresh states. Other than that I love the feeling of the lotion once applies (I have a mini fridge for my cream) but I just don't appreciate that feeling around sensitive skin cells. * I am so disappointed in the formula change :( I ordered a new jar and knew immediately after rubbing it on that something was off. It's almost soapy and doesn't seem to rub in like before. It leaves a bit of white residue too. I've been loyal to this moisturizer for so many years. My skin is not doing well and I'm worried I've developed a bit of an allergic reaction which is actually how I originally came to find this moisturizer. I am so saddened to have to now search for another moisturizer when my skin doesn't do well with most creams. This used to feel luxurious and almost silky.

Then last night I closed the lid on the jar and it had shattered. I got teeny tiny glass splinters in my fingers from cleaning up the mess and had to toss the jar which had half of the product still left. 

Glass jars aren't necessarily classy or luxurious, I don't understand why brands decided to use cheap glass for containers for products they know are going on a shelf or in a make up bag. 

I'm reallt sad I had to throw it away just because of poor packaging. * Not very moisturizing * Doesn't absorb.  Just lays on top of skin."

I love the travel size to keep in my purse. * Good product especially for those warmer locations for vaca's. perfect size for travel. * I originally received this product as a Christmas gift. I immediately loved the texture and creaminess and the way it kept my face moist all day. My foundation wears well over it. It can serve as a night cream if you wish. * I'm glad the Ulta consultant suggested this product * Let me just say, I have used a lot of different moisturizers. Out of all of the ones I've tried so far, this is the best. I have sensitive skin and don't usually struggle with bad acne, but I'm prone to break outs and flaky, dry skin (especially during the fall & winter months). So I've started using this and it actually works! It has totally helped to calm my breakouts and any redness I struggle with and has helped my skin feel smoother, gives it a glow, and just look better overall. It actually does what a moisturizer is supposed to do - moisturize!! It's very thick and feels a little wet and watery when you first apply. But after it dries, my skin literally feels so soft and stays moist all day long. I love it! And the fact that it's actually created to be safe for sensitive skin is a huge bonus for me and is exactly what I look for in skincare products. For those of you with sensitive skin who are looking for a great moisturizer, I highly recommend! * Did a test patch & immediately I felt a burning, stinging sensation. Washed it off but my face was irritated the rest of the day. I suspect it was the Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil I reacted to."

It pairs well with makeup and gives your skin a glow! I can't live without this product. Also, there is a definite noticable difference!!! I wish this was gifted- but this an honest opinion!! * I love this product and have been using it for years. It makes your skin feel so hydrated and it minimizes fine lines.  I am in my 60's and if I don't use this product I can definitely notice a difference.  This product was not gifted to me by strivectin though I wish it was. * Gifted by . From the moment I started using it, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin's hydration levels. The formula is incredibly nourishing and leaves my skin feeling soft, supple, and oh-so-hydrated. What's more, it doesn't just provide a temporary moisture boost – it actually helps to lock in hydration throughout the day, keeping my skin looking and feeling its best. * I used this moisturizer for fine lines on my face . It definitely helped fade it little bit . If I consistently use it , it should go away. 
It's also giving the healthy skin look . 
I received this moisturizer as complimentary from strivectin. * I'm eager to try this to tackle my stubborn wrinkles. I've already seen some smoothing on the edges and I'm excited to see more progress. Plus, the moisturizer is creamy and hydrating without feeling greasy. This was gifted by strivectin for me to provide my honest opinion! * I was gifted by Stivectin.I have dry facial skin especially around my mouth and nose. After using this cream I've noticed a major difference. My skin is no longer dry and peeling anymore. I like to apply a small amount on my face after cleansing and before applying sunblock and makeup. * Yet another fantastic product from a great brand! I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and I truly notice a difference. Extremely easy to apply and is very absorbent and not at all greasy. Excited to continue use. Gifted by Strivection"

My skin had some sensitivity issues a couple weeks after I started using the product - redness, small blisters and peeling. It might've been this product, might not, but i still have not recovered. Waited too long to return it and so I started using on my neck and chest without issues. I wear a lot of V-neck tops, and noticed my freckles and dark spots faded surprisingly quickly! I'm not sure if I will buy it again, but it DOES work. On the downside it has an unpleasant citrus scent. Im not usually bothered by scents but I'm not fond of this one. * Left my skin greasy and shiny but did not moisturize my skin. Would not recommend to use, did not see any improvement in my skin just felt like putting oily sun screen on my face. * I was excited to try this product since it is a moisturizer with sunscreen but after 2 uses it made me break out. Also I noticed it made my skin feel greasy. Will be returning it. * I love this moisturizer. I have been using it for 2 over years, I will always use it. I read some reviews saying their eyes burned and about the smell. I have very sensitive skin and have had zero issues. I love the light scent it has. My face drinks up this moisturizer. My skin looks and feels amazing when I use it. Everyone's skin is different, but I love this product and highly recommend it! * I just got this, so I havent used a whole lot, but it burns my eyes soooo bad."

Also my husband always gives me compliments when he kisses my cheek because he loves the clean fresh scent of this cream. * I use several Avene products.

It locks in moisture without feeling oily, too thick or too heavy. * This gel moisturizer seeps into the skin nicely, a little goes a long way. I have eczema, when it was super raw this did sting a little. The baby powder smell is OK, didn't bother me and I didn't love it either. This gentle yet effective for dry skin days.

I have 36yo DRY skin and I was getting a little peeling and dry patches from my Rx Tret. once a week, but had zero irritation using this every night! It's a pretty thick cream consistency so not the easiest to spread on its own IMO. I like to use a serum before this Retrinal .5% to help it glide on the skin easier. One pump usually does it, but sometimes I add just a tiny bit more if I feel like I didn't get even coverage. It's definitely a long term product so don't expect immediate results. I DO wish Ulta carried the 1.0 version of this instead of just the .5%. * I just bought this product and I am loving it. I can't speak on results yet but as someone with oily/acne prone  skin, I feel like I finally found an anti-aging product that absorbs well and doesn't break me out. It may feel slightly ""heavy"" at first but it absorbs. Great for sensitive skin, as well! So happy I found this brand * I tried a couple of retinal creams, and had breakouts and/or burning. Having used many Avene products with great results, I took their skin quiz online, and this product was recommended. It is a great alternative to retinol, at a very low dosage so you can start to build use. I've had great success with it, and it is helping with fine lines around my eyes. I can use it every night with absolutely no irritation."

I think brands should be more transparent about informing their customers that they're actually buying a different product than what they're used to. The consistency of the new cream is thicker and harder to spread, but what stands out the most to me is the smell: somewhere in between Play-Doh and generic baby sunscreen. My partner has sensitive skin around his eyes, and the old formula didn't cause him any burning, but the new one does. I wouldn't buy this again. * I bought this because it had avobenzone but no octocrylene (at the time). Great texture but I reacted badly to something in it. Guessing it was the algae because I've used the other ingredients before without issue. * DO NOT BUY new formula is horrible. Not the same product whatsoever. Why ruin a great product everyone loved?? Makes no sense. Ive gone through at least 10 of these moisturizers and now i will no longer purchase. And the new scent is a crime against humanity. * This used to be SOOOO awesome.  Now my face oily by 10 am and feels very irritated.  Also broke me out for the first time in a while.  Had zero issues with the old formula.  I really hope they change it back * What a great and rich sunscreen! The texture of this is super rich and hydrating while feeling so comfortable on my skin. I love that it doesn't leave a white film over my skin, it just soaks right in. Gifted by Supergoop * This was my holy grail of moisturizers with sunscreen for years. It kept my skin hydrated without making it greasy, had no scent, played well with any eye cream I paired it with and never broke me out. Since the formula change, this has given me nothing but problems.
First is the scent. IT REEKS. It smells like a burning pit and the smell does NOT dissipate. I am super sensitive to scents and the old formula had a slight smell to it but you didn't notice it after you put it on.
Next, the consistency is now a bit chalky and not as creamy as it used to be.
Lastly, the hydration is gone. My skin is dry about 45 minutes after I put this on. Now, that could be mostly due to my skin hating the new formula, so take this as you will.
I hate that I have to stop using this. It was a decent price and worked well for me which can be hard to come by, but I'll sadly have to give it up."

Also, much smaller container for same or more cost. So disappointed in this new formula. Really hope they will bring back the gel creme. * Love the texture and I was hoping it would be a suitable new nighttime moisturizer for me however my face breaks out when I use it.

Really glad I happened upon it! * This contains Avobenzone, Octisalate, and Octocrylene....FYI * I joke that this is my old lady face cream because it smells like a bouquet of roses.

This is why I love samples, It lets me fiind out what I love without spending a fortune first.  It has the faintest fragrance that is subtle but lovely. It goes on so smooth and is just pleasant to use. My only complaint is the price. Some of us would buy this brand more often if we weren't priced out of the market. This is why I gave it a four. Otherwise, a five all the way. * This smells like febreeze and it doesn't go away when you rub it in :( save your monies * I use this product daily.  It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.

Only downside is that this is expensive so I will wait for coupons/sales in order to repurchase. * Love the product.

Not oily or dry, just healthy. So far, I'm enjoying it * This is a great moisturizer! I love that it works so great and has NO harmful ingredients. * Honestly, moisturizer wise this is a great product for night time use. While consistency is tacky and thick it DOES moisturize skin and perserves hydration throughout the night. 

Experience wise, its not my favorite. It doesnt glide onto skin easily due to tacky consistency and it pulls a little during application. It does feel very heavy on skin, and leaves a filmy feeling on skin. 

That being said, I didnt like this moisturizer a lot and I would reccomend it as a night moisturizer. But if you want hydration AND a great experience there are other products out there that fulfills that better! * Very hydrating, thick,  and doesnt have a gross smell!! * I have very sensitive eczema prone skin and this moisturizer is amazing. It is thick yes but keeps the moisture in and doesn't sting. Love it. * This is only my second day using this product and I was going to wait longer to review it but every time I use this cream I am amazed at how my skin literally drinks it up. I have combination to oily skin. Acne prone skin since I was a preteen. I recently reintroduced a retinoid (about 2 months ago) to my night time routine (every other night) and my skin has been feeling so dehydrated and oily at the same time… so ive been on a hunt to find a hydrating cream. Something that doesnt sit on my skin and definitely not something that I have to constantly reapply bc my skin feels dry again. 
I know the texture can throw some ppl off but I love it. If nothing else has been working to hydrate your skin, GIVE THIS A SHOT! * I previously wrote a positive review, but after a couple of weeks of use, I have to update. This moisturized well, but it consistently caused a breakout. It was a zit in a different place every time I used it. Maybe this would work for someone with less acne-prone skin."

This is a light weight moisturizer that doesn't leave her skin looking oily. Great product. * This has been the best product in helping my 11 year old begin her journey of facial care. It has done wonders for her skin. * This was recommended to me over a decade ago from my dermatologist. Haven't stopped using it since. Makes my face feel so clean but not stripped. Highly recommend. * One of the BEST cleansers you'll buy. It perfectly cleans my skin. * Im 45 and have normal skin. I loved this face wash at first because it didn't leave any residue and my face felt clean.  Then after about 10 days or so my face was super dry. It burned when I put lotion on it. I realized it was this face wash. I just went back yesterday and got the hydrating face wash. I hope that one works as I really wanna like this brand. * I will 100% always stand by and use this product. It has never given my very sensitive and allergic reaction prone skin any issues. It helps remove excess oil without making my face feel like a desert. And it removes all makeup I've ever worn, including very strong-grip special effects makeup I wore on halloween. * Purchased this for my adult son who works outside all day in the sun on a flight line. He states when he gets home this is the 1st product he grabs to clean his face. He loves its lightweight and cleans thoroughly without irritating or drying out his skin."

The smell is so offputting i dont want to use it * The product has a very nice consistency and feels great on my face.  It is too soon to tell if it makes a difference but I really like it so far * I have been using for about 2 weeks now 4 times a week and I am not super in love. Its keeps me moisturized but its no different than a Olay product for half the cost. * I'm in love! after just 1 week of using this, my almost 45 year old skin has never looked better. It took a day or 2 for my skin to adjust to it. Was a little itchy at first but that has gone away. I can actually FEEL my skin tightening up and feel the quenching. I can't wait to use it every day. Amazing! * I really wanted to love this moisturizer. It is very thick and perfect for my nighttime routine. It would be amazing for winter months. I actually also love the scent of it. It makes my skin feel completely moisturized and looks glowy afterwards as well. Unfortunately I have dry, sensitive skin and it has caused severe breakouts all over my face. For the price I paid I'm disappointed but always a risk I take when trying a new product. * I was hesitant to buy this cream. I have tried so many different brands that promise some of the same things. Then I tested a small amount on the back of my hand in store. I was shocked, it even made my aging hand look better.
I pulled out my Ulta card and purchased, thinking I will try this one jar and see. I was still skeptical.
I have been using this for 2 1/2 month and notice a huge difference in my skin. I HIGHLY recommend this moisturizer. If you are on the fence, take the plunge. And yes, I am telling my friends about this (at least the ones I like)!"

It doing what it needs to do, im not getting wrinkles or dry skin and i use it alone & under make up. I'm often asked if im 35 so i have to give some credit to kehls for it. I love the line, its fine quality and i will never waver! * I bought this after many great reviews. I used it around 10 times and thought it was sunburn because I was red and sore. I switched to e45 then another brand and I was fine. I then tried it again after a couple of weeks and it stung my face again! I usually don't have sensitive skin and I'm gutted I spent so much and now can't use it * Every single thing on my face 'balls up' when I use this moisturizer, including when I use it alone.  It does not absorb into my skin, but just sits on top. I've tried it in so many combinations and it's just incompatible with other skin care and foundations (I've tried several foundations -high end & low end- with same results).  I've also tried using it with serums, different primers, different sunscreens and alone with the same result. This is a hard pass for me. * In my early adulthood i had terrible acne and skin probs. I tried proactive and everything at the drugstore, nothing worked. I found Kiehl's and my skin turned right around and I've never had a problem since. Im willing to pay for good skin care, but this price still hurts. My skin would feel waxy and really greasy for a long time which aggravated my pores, which in turn aggravated me. It doesnt feel moisturizing at all. I feel like i just wasted a lot of money. Kiehl's let me down for the first time : ( * It goes on creamy and smoothly, and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks so good. Been using this and all Kiehls products for many years. * This was extremely irritating to my skin. It started to burn and little pimples developed. I had to wash it off immediately.  Fortunately, this was a sample product. I will never be purchasing this item! * I got a free sample of this with purchase from Ulta and I greatly appreciate it but this really Burns my skin especially around my nose. I read reviews from other people that had the same irritations. I have no idea what is in this cream that burns and stings for hours."

I wouldn't say it helped my acne any, but i didn't break out bad and that's what i'm looking for :) the pump is awful though, barely works, wish it came in a different container. * i love this product but most of the bottle is air and only filled around halfway with the product. it is a wonderful product to help ease your acne but you definitely need to be willing to pay a lot for it and the select amount that you will get from the bottle * After two or three uses my entire face became red where I had applied it. Cannot figure out which ingredient i would be allergic to. Put Cortizone and neosporin all over my face to calm it down. * Just seemed it wasn't worth the money. It didn't last all that long. I didn't see a difference in my skin. * Initially, very underwhelmed w/this product. Decided to finish my small sample tube & wow! In my 50's w/normal-dry skin & VERY acne prone. I never get full blown whiteheads nor blackheads just a few congested / closed comedones (always same spot).  In almost 3 weeks, no returning comedones plus comfortable hydration & smoooooth skin.

It makes me look so pale. I am so surprised given the price and the fact it is supposed to be a ""daily moisturizer."" Would not waste your money. * I loved the fact that it had hyaluronic acid and SPF in one, but after putting it on, I realize it's definitely not for me. I hoped the reviews were wrong, but it definitely leaves a white cast over your skin, and made me look super pale, despite the fact that I have a fair, medium skin tone. * I have tried almost every mineral sunscreen under the sun. I'm fair skin, freckles, burn easily, break out easily and this sunscreen moisturizer has been amazing. There is a white cast initially but I rub the product between my fingers before applying and it blends within 5 minutes! I never get sunburn on my face while wearing this. I also apply a ceramide barrier serum beforehand and do not experience any dryness while using this product. Would absolutely purchase a cool toned tinted version of this. * I like this sunscreen for days inside where im not too worried about reapplying. This sunscreen feels great on the skin once rubbed in, but its a workout to do so. I'd give this more stars if it wasnt so hard to rub in, which is why i use it on days I'm inside. It also gives a slight white cast but it does go away quickly. Otherwise, it's very moisturizing and doesnt feel tight on my dry skin even if i forget moisturizer underneath."

The new glass jar is a nice touch to make the product feel a bit more elevated. * I used the water gel for years, because it was the only affordable moisturizer I could find that didn't make me break out. I have combination skin. Now with the new formula, I am breaking out like crazy. I will not buy this again. Sadly, I have do go on another quest to find another moisturizer that works for my skin. * NO WAY. IT'S THE SMALL CONTAINER FOR $1 LESS THAN 1.7 OZ.
Don't buy this size at this price. Look around * V happy with this! I was super p.o about them changing the formula of the Hydroboost Extra Dry gel (now the Hydroboost water cream) I was using because it's the only thing that worked for me. That one has *horrid* reviews now about being too heavy and acne causing. This is perfect and I would consider it the same product as the old one I liked. Glad I went with this instead of the other one. I have dry, sensitive skin and this moisturized and kept me smooth with no breakouts. * I wanted to like this, but I miss the old formula/extra dry gel cream. The old cream was like a drink for my face and my skin looked amazing. This new formula feels sticky and oily. I do not like it and hate when companies change something that isn't messed up. Disappointed. * It's really hydrating, but if you have normal or oily skin, that's a problem! I have normal skin, and my facial therapist ended up giving me a lighter version of another brand name she has ;) * Moisturizing, refreshing, cool, and easy to apply."

I started using it a year or two ago and I've gone through multiple jars. It's lightweight and the texture is amazing. Starts off as a cream but then it disperses and feels like water on your skin. It leaves your skin so hydrated and dewy looking! * My favorite moisturizer so far ! If you have DRY skin thos moisturizer is a life saver & its clean ingredients ! I have sensitive skin as well and this moisturizer has never gave me any problems ! Love it ! * I wanted to try Honest for its ""clean ingredients"" so i got the little trio kit, this cream came in it. It smells nice and does go from feeling creamy dipping finger into the pot and then a watery feel rubbing it in my face. However, it doesnt turn lightweight like most watery-gel creams. This is still very heavy and thick, i even went back to look at the ingredient list to see if it had SPF in it. This would be great for those with dry skin, but if you have oily skin and want something like the moisture bomb gel cream, this isnt it. To me, the name is a little misleading. * I have struggled FOREVER finding a good moisturizer. I have extremely acne prone skin, and a ton of moisturizers break me out or give me fungal acne. I use this in the morning since its a lightweight moisturizer and it leaves my skin feeling nice but not greasy. I have combination skin, it used to be more oily before I started going to a dermatologist and was put on a topical that tends to dry me out. I do prefer a thicker moisturizer at night, but I will continue purchasing this one over and over! * I love the honest product line and use many other honest products so i gave this a try. 

It leaves my skin really shiny, i can feel it on my face, almost kind of oily, and it looks thick in the container but when you put it on its super thin and watery. For it to feel so useless and thin and watery and still make my face feel gross and oily is beyond me. Definitely wont be using again. * Great moisturizer. I really like how it has a water like texture after applying so it feels extra hydrating and soothing. My skin is very reactive so seeing it was EWG approved made me want to try, I wish I found this sooner!! * The texture of this is insane and so unique. When you start to appy it it feels like a typical moisturizer and as you work it into your skin it begins to feel like a water/serum hybrid. So lightweight, not greasy, and soooooo hydrating. This is my favorite texture of a moisturizer ever"

This does not moisturize and is more of a thick green paste that makes your make up look bad too. Yikes * This lotion is ok. I realized after buying and using that la roche posay is not a cruelty free line. Will never repurchase. * I've been using this product for about two weeks and noticed a difference with my redness but recently got a slight sunburn which it does not help for. * At first I was skeptical about this product due to the reviews but I just went ahead and tried it anyways after trying it I realized this is a good product for when I do not feel like wearing make up especially because I do have acne scars but the only fall down is I've tried other products that are green and they are supposed to correct redness and they have worked better than this product this product is not as full coverage as other products I have used in the past but I would still purchase this product * Awful.

I'm so happy I gave it a try. * Though I do love the way this lotion feels on my skin, I won't purchase this again unless the packaging changes. It feels cheap and only works about 2/3 of the time.

Amazing product thzt actually does qhat it says. * I used this for over two weeks straight every morning and night. While I did not notice any difference in my fine lines, it did. leave my skin very soft. This was a free, full-size sample of RoC Retinol Correxion Line Smoothing Max Hydration Cream Fragrance Free from PinchMe. I also let my mother try it and she is very picky. She likes it so this is something I would be purchasing. * I didn't have much experience with Roc, but I adore skincare so when I had the opportunity to try RoC's Retinol Correction cream gratis, I jumped at it.  And I was really pleased.  The cream is a little bit gel like, which helps it smooth on really easily, and I will take no scent over an awful old lady fragrance any day.  The gold cap smudges and shows water spots easily which isn't ideal, but overall the jar looks expensive.  The cream absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel plumped and very soft.  I don't like to wear retinol during the day, so I use a different moisturiser with vitamin C and SPF during the day and this one at night.  This gives me renewed-feeling skin in the morning. * The RoC products do not disappoint. The high expectations of this product were met. Easy to use and amazing results. This left my skin hydrated and soft.  I normally don't use retinol but this changed my mind.  Thanks to PinchMe for the free sample. * I reallt liked this ROC hydration cream. It felt great on my skin and hydrated well. Will buy this again. * This cream was very easy to apply and felt great. Very hydrating and lasts all day. * I have been using this moisturizing cream for a few weeks now. I, honestly, haven't noticed any improvement in my fine lines on my forehead.

I don't even feel the need to go back over my skin with foundation or concealer now. I wish this came in a bigger size if this is going to be my everyday solution for all * I am normally a super full coverage girlie, but I sweat so much in the CA heat I was tired of having my redness exposed by sunglasses or on the perimiter of my face when I sweat off my makeup. I bought this to try on sale and I'm completely hooked! It has light coverage but covers my redness enough that its not noticeable. You do need to blend it in (I just use my fingerd) and blend it down your neck well.  I am usually the lightest or second lightest shade in foundations and this can be dark on me if not blended. I use concealer under my eyes and on my reddest area on my nose and set with powder and it lasts through my workday with no problems.  I use one size matte primer and powder to set as I have very oily skin. Definitely recommend this to anyone to try! * I purchased this based off all the good reviews but this product did nothing for my redness. I love other products from this brand but I'll be returning this. * This was okay I wanted to like the product so badly it blends into my skin so perfectly but it just doesn't cover up the redness like it's a nice light coverage foundation type thing but doesn't really cover up any redness like I thought all my blood would've been gone, but they weren't! So ya * I have been struggling with hormonal acne for a longgg time. Im currently on winlevi and trentinoin to help with my skin, and im seeing some good results. But while my skin is getting better, i wanted something that could reduce the look of redness on a day to day basis. This works!! It doesnt make you look green eithier. It reduces the redness as soon as you blend it in. Im going to be honest, i dont know how well this would work for darker skin tones, but for reference im light-medium and it worked well for me! Love it!! 🩷 * I bought this on impulse not really expecting it to work, but I use it every day! I've substituted my everyday foundation and concealer for this as it does have noticeable (but light) coverage. It does initially blend very very warm since I'm about as pale as a Tim Burton character, so I do have to spend some extra time blending it out. But once I do it's perfect! I even blend it under my eyes to neutralize dark circles lol. Make sure your skin is moisturized for the best result, but not actively wet/moist or it will pill in my experience. Love! * This product is great! A little bit goes a long way and it covers my redness very well. If I have a veey red blemish it tones that down and lays nicely on the skin."

This is dewy and hydrating without breaking me out. My skin is less red and smoother after using this. Love it! * I absolutely love this moisturizer! It's light & feels very hydrating. I love the dewy finish on my skin, but I wouldn't recommend for oily girls. This has Propolis at the very top of the ingredient list, so you know you're getting all the benefits for an affordable price. Not to mention it's fragrance free! I pair this with a peptide eye cream & it has diminished my fine lines * In lieu of my 5 star rating, this product sadly ended up in my ""can't use"" category. I absolutely loved EVERYTHING about the whole Propolis line, but unforturnately Propolis is an allergen tested during an allergy patch test and mine showed a trace reaction which my allergist informed me to avoid any allergens even if it is only a trace. This could be an issue for people who have sensitive skin. I have to say that other than being a possible irritant or allergy to some, this moisturizer is a really great consistency and lives up to all the expectations that it claims to have. As with any product that is new to your skin, proceed with caution and do a patch test. Its worth knowing :) * I love the toner and serum in this line but for whatever reason this lotion is just waaay too much for me. It would irritate my exzema and cause small/minor breakouts. I have dry/reactive/acne prone skin so moisturizers are a challenge for me * My skin loves it! My pores look smooth, its calming & hydrating without looking greasy. A little goes a long way. * I LOVE THIS! My skin took around a week to really settle into this as my face reacts to new things. However once i got into the routine of using this, my pores look smooth, my skin is plump, and is overall hydrating without looking greasy. It also calms down the redness I have on my cheeks. A little goes a long way. I finally found a moisturizer that works for me. * I was hesitant to try this however, it makes my skin feel great.  I use this with a few of the same line and I believe my skin looks and feels tighter and more moisturized!"

This was not moisturizing enough for me. My skin felt dry and tight by the afternoon. I was using the Kopari peptide glow cream (which you cant buy from ulta anymore.) my skin really liked that one gave a nice glow and my skin felt hydrated all day. * Product feels smooth in your skin * I've used this product for awhile now and I love how it makes my skin feel soft and hydrated * This has been so good for my face, I have sensitive skin and it's been perfect * Let me start by saying I have been in the industry for over 30 years.  This moisturizer was one of the beauty steals, so I wanted to give it a try.  I am 58 years young and my skin has become very dry over the years due to hormone changes.  I have tried so many moisturizers and my skin is still dry/dehydrated.   I tried it for the first time yesterday and ""omg,"" my skin felt like glass and super hydrated. Korean skincare is amazing! This ceramide moisturizer contains hyaluronic acid( moisture magnet), vegan dessert milk, and whipped coconut milk as the active ingredients.  A little goes a LONG way. In my opinion it would also work well for combination skin.  This is the one and only for me! * I love this cream first time using it so glad I got it half off on the 21 days of Beauty. It is medium thickness, but the way it wears throughout the night. I use it as a night cream and when I wake up in the morning, I still have that hydration that slippery effect to my skin. I use it under my eyes on my neck my face. I've used it for three days and I can already feel, a plump tightness affect so I will continue to use this and if it still continues to give these results, this will be a staple in my nighttime skin routine. I am 46 a more mature woman with under Eye hollow is not as hollow and my jowls seem like they are more tightened so a very big fan of this. I would not use this in the morning considering it does have that lasting slip affect to it but perfect for nighttime. If you have oil skin i probably wouldn't recommend but dry skin, chefs kiss * The moisturizer is the perfect mixture between livht and heavy, making it just right for most skin types. You get fast results and it really transformed my skin for the better. 10/10 would definitely recommend!"

A little goes a long way. It's very soothing and moisturizing. It does not settle in pores and it does not pill. I use it before I put on my tinted moisturizer. * Refreshing light citrus scent, cool on the skin, moisturizes without feeling heavy or greasy. * I was looking for cheaper dupe to the 100hr moisture surge from clinique and this was the only other moisturizer that has caffine in it. But the smell was too strong. Says theres essential oil inside but i never break out but i did. Go pay the extra 10 or get moisturizer surge. Also blackfriday and other holidays it goes on sale * I received a sample of this product in a big sample kit and decided to try it out. I had been using The Ordinary Niacinamide + Zinc for the longest time and after trying out the sample there is no going back for me. I had no idea but The Ordinary was causing breakouts which cleared up in a matter of days once switching to this. It makes my skin feel refreshed almost immediately and my skin looks brighter and plumper after just 30 minutes. Normally heavily fragrant products make me break out and cause my face to burn due to my sensitive skin but I have not had this issue at all with this product. It is a refreshing citrus smell which I absolutely LOVE the smell of citrus. After long time use my skin consistently looked brighter and I had less dry skin and fine lines. It is true that it does leave your skin feeling sticky but I always put my moisturizer on top of it and the stickiness is no longer an issue. I highly recommend this product!! * This moisturizer has really leveled up the radiance of my face. I use this as my night cream, and ive been waking up to increasibgly refreshed and energetic skin with each passing day. * My skin has never felt so soft. I also use the scrub so the combination is making my skin look younger and softer! * I have been using this product for years and it was great, but now, the formula changed and caused my face to break out. Will not be repurchasing."

I will never use anything else! * I have sensitive combo skin. In my late 20's. Love hydration over night. The smell is just… not good. It honestly smells like… product with no smell. Which HAS a smell. Loved that it was fragrance free but I just couldn't. Went back to my fave from Lush, the Peace moisturizer. * I had to return this. I was so excited, put it on my face, and it smelled like mildew and rancid oils. I got most of it off, but even on my dry skin, it was SO greasy. Ulta keeps sending bad, broken, or damaged products. I was so excited to try a nice barrier cream, but this was not it. be careful which peach & lilly products you pick. unfortunately ulta in-store stock isn't much better. The employee actually put my return back on the shelf by accident! I had to tell her it was bad and used once. She was nice, and they got it, but QA/QC is bad at Ulta right now. * Broke me out so so bad. The breakout lasted for months and now i have dark spots from it. * I recently  developed eczema on my eyelids and for several months tried covering it with makeup, only making it worse. It sooths my eyelids and makes my sensitive skin feel calm  and soft. I will keep using this even with the flare has cleared up. * Not for me, it irritated my skin. Although it has no fragrance it irritates my skin and makes me break out. I think because it's too thick it clogs my pores. * I have freakishly sensitive skin with rosacea that reacts to so many products. I do well with La Roche Posay's B5 Balm so I decided to try this since it has cica. My skin loves it!! It's not too heavy or greasy, very soothing, and makes my skin look so soft and smooth. The scent I detect is similar to pure jojoba oil which doesn't bother me since so many fragrances and extracts are off limits. I've already purchased a 2nd jar and will continue to use it as long as they keep making it."

It has a really nice smell without being strong. The only thing I don't like is that it's a bit pricey for the quantity. * They changed the formula and the smell is completely different. I used to love this product because it smelled like a spa. The new formula also does not feel as rich on the skin. This will be my last bottle. Too pricey and it is near impossible to get the last 1/4 of the product out of the jar, * I purchased this cream and overnight cream for my face along with the body lotion ..WELL
They all smell the same overnight and Day facial cream is the same to me 
I spent over $100.00 on two facial products are the same .
won't buy it again * Lightweight, smells great and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. * Ok seriously Ive tried thousands of products over the yeara because i have sensitive ans acne prone skin! Ive been using this every day sometimes twice a day if i rememebr and its kept my skin CLEAR!! Even with the return of rhe mask mandate at work its protected my skin from my ""maskne"" ive had theoughout the pandemic. Would definetlt recomend this. This trial ive used this alone for about a month and a half. * I got a free sample of this product. It is NOT fragrance free. I immediately had to wash my face * This is a really good product for my combination skin. Vey matte and leaves no oily residue. However, they need to change the bottle on this product.

It worked very good on my skin. * This is marketed for normal-dry skin but I have combo-oily and my skin drinks this! Also not marketed for my age range (20s), but if you're looking to splurge, this is it! I bought it on a whim as a Beauty Steal and I would absolutely buy it again. It's super hydrating but lightweight, not greasy, great for sensitive skin, and leaves me with a healthy glow! This moisturizer has helped to smooth my skin especially as I'm dealing with breakouts - gives me better glass skin than some Asian beauty products that claim to do so. Love love love! * A light moisturizer that delivers maximum hydration.  I have always had good results from Clarins products. * This could be a great prduct if they took out the nasty fragrance. It's so bad and lingers on my skin for hours. When I use this one, my cat won't come near me and cowers if I try to oet him. That should tell you how bad the smell of this is. * Buy it. * Never used any face product that is this much perfumed. Thinking about return."

Quite  expensive for the combo… but it works great with make up or just as a tinted moisturizer with mascara. * This is a great product and feels good on my skin, but I can't use it like other moisture products before applying my foundation because of pilling.. I now use only at night so I'm not putting anything over it. * I like it. I also drink collagen supplements so i think it works pretty well on top if it. Im only 23 so i dont have wrinkles to begin with but i will say that its pretty sticky going on and if you touch your face while its trying to dry than you will get the 'beads' like everyone else is saying but if you dont touch your face until its fully dry it will look normal * I was hoping this product was going to be my stop to moisturizer search. my skin is extremely dry. it does leave your skin feeling very soft. I wouldn't say I noticed any noticeable difference besides a shiny forehead. the thing I really don't like about this product is after you rub it in and it drys, if you rub your face it peels up its gross...... I'm sad I wish I could love this product and for over $80 I don't want the product to ball up and peel on my face. * makes you skin feel refreshed, still have wrinkles but maybe a few weeks will diminish them * I am amazed at the results.

Wish they'd reformulate it so I could go back to using it again. * I personally wasn't a fan of this product. First I want to point out the sales associates at Ulta are super sexist to men and I got passed multiple times every time I asked for help literally ignored me. But back to this product, it's very similar to sun screen I prefer a thicker face lotion like the 2-1 face & beard but that got discontinued. * After years of using Vasaline Intensive Care lotion on his face, I convinced him to try the Clinique For Men Broad Spectrum SPF21 Moisturizer.  He loved it!  For a lotion with sun scree, it's not greasy and  it absorbs into the skin nicely leaving no residue. * If you've ever had a reaction to a sunscreen this one probably contains your culprit. Wore once and broke out in a rash/hives where it was applied. I will now be avoiding oxybenzone. * Applied it at the store to test it out and also bought some, a few hours later had a giant bump on my chin. Going to rerun it tomorrow. * This is the only product my husband doesn't seem to have a skin reaction to.

My legs tend to get really dry, so I got this specifically for those areas. However, I got KP as well and wanted to hydrate those areas too. By the way, it does have that oily/greasy feel to the lotion, but that feeling does go away after a while. My skin definitely feels and looks a lot better after I use them.

No, no new foods or other items. She immediately began burning. Her face is like this on both sides and she has never had sensitive reaction to any other product. * I have dry, but clear skin. However, summertime + makeup = sweaty breakouts. So to stay on top of it, I started using this product once daily during my nighttime routine. Started working in just a few days of use. Now, instead of having several problem areas after a full day of wearing a full face of  makeup and sweating, I maybe have just small baby blemish that resolves itself overnight. It also does not dry out my skin more than it already is, if anything my skin has been feeling softer and more hydrated. I use La Roche Posay double repair moisturizer and it works well alongside it. With how well this has worked for me, I'm excited to try more products from them. Highly recommend! * i love this brand so much i've literally never been disappointed with any of their stuff but my makeup grips onto this like the hydro grip primer i am in love!!

I tried it with my normal skin tint on top and powdered lightly but it still shows oily through the makeup and i dont love that. I used it as a body sunscreen and worked great on legs and feet for our beach trip, used it up that way and will not repurchase. I do love the daily moisturizer (without spf) and jt also contains squalane but sinks in better and does not have the greasy finish like this one does.

It's super light, absorbs very quickly and keeps my skin moisturized all night. * One of the best moisturizers ive used and ive used quite a few. I honestly it better then even the more expensive, better reviewed competitors (like Tatcha or Glow Recipe). The smell is strong but it works really well and makes my skin glow and feel good. * lightweight, not too glowy , easy to layer with sunscreens * I was advised to try this instead of more makeup to cover red areas on my skin. It worked immediately and just zapped my dry skin issues.

Okay so after bottle #2 I decided to branch out and try something new (I know we all do it!) so after almost 3 mths of using something else my face lacked it's glow and some of my hyperpigmentation returned around my cheeks and upper lip. I had managed to clear almost all of it up while using this! Stupidly I fell for a video of a different product and switched to it. I just went out and bought this again and already my face feels softer again and I know my hyperpigmentation will decrease again! I won't make that mistake again! This formula does not contain dimethicone which is important to me, I don't want a fake softness to my skin, I want a nourished softness. This is light and silky going on and even with dehydrated, dry skin I can skip a top moisturizer most days. The light smell goes away within seconds and does not bother me at all - strong botanical smells cause a migraine- lucky me! This is not a gel it is more like a serum texture or a light lotion texture, it sinks in pretty quickly. The bottle is glass and beautiful on my countertop, plus pump bottles are way more sanitary than droppers or jars. I appreciate a good pump bottle because I know when something comes with a spatula I'm using my fingers after about a week and a dropper always ends up touching my face or not sucking up enough product so I get mad at it! Come on beauty industry there is nothing wrong with a pump dispenser! Take note!!! I highly recommend this product and pray Lancome doesn't ever discontinue it! 
So if you have uneven tone, hyperpigmentation, dry and or dehydrated skin, aging skin, and dislike dimethicone you may love this formula! * I have been using this product for several years. I began using it during a Summer because it was lightweight, and continued through the year."

I always went back to it and my skin looked great. I don't know what they did to this product, but it has made by skin break out with a terrible allergic reaction. This formula is NO good. I will be returning this. * It's a great product but after using for a week I thought it was my allergies then I realized it was this cream I was putting on my face. Yes I recommend it but I'm allergic to it. * Great team and it works! * Love it * I am due for my Btx, however, I've been using this for 3 days and I can put it off. off.

It may have been three worst. It didn't work and just sat on top of my skin. I tried it with and without moisturizer, no change. Disappointed her again. * I am fair skinned with a neutral undertone. This was way too dark and orangey. The texture and finish is greasy. I expected it to be dewy and light coverage. But it felt slimy and looked blotchy whether I applied it with my fingers or a brush. Also, the ingredients separate, so you must shake it before using. Otherwise, watery liquid pours out. The smell is also sort of weird. I wish it had a redeeming quality. * Super orangey, feels more like a cheap sunscreen than a moisturizer * This mighr be a good product for a medium skintone, but on my fair cool toned skin it was super orange. I bought it hoping i could use it under foundation or concealer, but even then its just way too orange and several shades too dark. * The chalky texture of this moisturizer is not my preference, I wouldn't say it did much for my redness either. I am a brown person so after applying this, I had a mild white cast on my deep olive skintone. * I thought this was a moisturizer but as soon as i opened it, greasy stuff csme POURING out. I shook the bottle and it sounds like water jusy splashing in there. Smelled like piss. No thanks. * So glad I came across this and decided to give it a try! I have extremely dry, sensitive, but acne-prone skin. I am fair skinned and have always struggled to find a foundation that matches my skin tone, doesn't cause break outs or irritate my skin, and that doesn't highlight every single patch of dry skin. This ticks all of those boxes! It is thick and moisturizing, but my dry skin appreciates that. It is a little shiny, but I'm used to this with having to apply thick moisturizers so it doesn't bother me. You MUST shake the bottle before using, it helps to blend the ingredients together. It appears too dark & orange upon rubbing together in my fingers, but blends nicely into the skin and really does match very well! It is a tiny tiny bit dark for me, but hardly noticeable, especially once finished with the rest of my makeup. I prefer this over the Dr. Jart cream as this is liquid so it's easier to apply all over, more hydrating, has a little tint to it (Dr. Jart makes me look a little paler), and the price point! Definitely worth a shot for those dry/red skin girls! Please do not discontinue this!"

It's very glowy but the product feels greasy and it pills so badly under my sunscreen.  I don't see myself repurchasing after it's gone. * I'm normally very sensitive to vitimam c products. the last one I used was from bliss which if I'm being honest was not horrible at all and caused the least amount of irritation/redness of any other, BUT it still caused it unfortunately. 

had kinda given up until I started using mostrizer  from First Aid beauty that I people picked up on a whim. instant love!!  so this led to seeking other products from the brand, hence this review!  
won't speak for those who had bad reactions,  NOT every product is going to work for every person!! and I've had my fair share!! this thou ,for me, has been fantastic!! no irritation ( at any point) no redness , just glowy hydrated skin! iv got combo dry leaning skin that's sensitive and this is the only vit c I've used that didn't cause me issue!! wish I had tried sooner!! * I'm 43 with combonation dry leaning skin that's sensitive... especially to products with vitimam c , they are usually way too irritating causing a lot of inflammation and redness... I picked  this up after trying other products from first aid beauty and loving the results! 

been using for about 3 Days now and no irritation or rednessi!!  this will be my go to!! * DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  I do not have sensitive skin and regularly use vitamin c on my skin, this product began burning my skin the instant it hit my face and even though I washed it off immediately, I can feel my skin barrier is damaged 2 days later, water stings my face as does any moisturizer.  Not sure what is in this, but it's horrible.  This product is not suitable for anyone's skin in my opinion and should be pulled from shelves. * I've used this skincare product for a week, and the results are incredible. It stings a bit at first, likely due to my sensitive skin, but the sensation doesn't last long.My skin feels and looks amazing—no need for foundation or concealer. I've received many compliments on my glowing complexion. The brief sting is definitely worth it! * If youve got sensitive skin, go ahead and skip this one. I think there's too much vitamin C in it or something, it makes the formula way too harsh. * Got this a sample for a gift with purchase and absolutely loved! I have noticed my skin be visibly brighter, more firm and looking youthful and plump! ✨✨✨✨ the perfect hydration layered with the FAB ultra repair cream. Feels amazing on the skin, very lightweight while completely moisturizing and nurishing my skin 💛💛💛💛"

I use Olay sensitive during the winter months and usually add Neutrogena SPF, but I found this product this spring and decided to try it. I absolutely love. I use serum first and then this. I absorbs nicely and doesn't leave my skin sticky. I use under my eyes and my eye lids and I do not experience any burning. I occasionally use powder foundation and it holds all day. the scent is nice and not over powering like other products. * Wanted to love this product however it burns my eyes!! * Great product. * I can only put this on about half of my face because of how incredibly badly it makes my eyes sting. Even if I take care to avoid the eye area, it creeps in them somehow. Feels nice as a moisturizer but it makes me look more sweaty/oil slick than glowy. Have to completely cover my face with setting powder for my skin to not look wet. * this product provided a good moisturizer for my skin but it left my skin oily. I used it with a hydrating serum after but I also used the moisturizer by itself and it still made my skin oily. It made my face smell like sunscreen but it helped with an initial layer of sun protection. If it wasn't so oily I would like this product. * not my favorite. its oily, and it has a not pleasant sun screen smell. I wouldn't buy it again. * Works well on majority of the face. However, my eyebrows and any contact with the under eyes was insane. Burning, itchy, puffy, allergic reaction type symptoms. Never have reacted to any product and I have had success with neutrogena and other hydro boost products. This one is a no for me personally. Could not continue using knowing the burning allergic reaction/chemical burn feeling on my eyebrows specifically."

I bought the sample size and have been using it every day for a month now and I had to buy a second one because it worked so well for moisturizing my skin for context I am in my late 30s and I have combinational skin, I do not get any breakouts from using this and it really offers a great boost and moisture. I would highly recommend it. * Purchased this product on a whim because it was near the checkout counter. I am so glad that I did. I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have seen a change in the brightness of my skin and evenness as well within the first few days of using it. 5 STARS. * I really enjoy this cream. I use it on and off, and as soon as I stop I notice a difference in my skin quality. It is a great base for makeup and stops my dry skin from flaking * i have very pale, sensitive skin, so i am always nervous about trying new moisturizers. i use this moisturizer in the mornings and it makes my skin look dewy and does not make my redness worsen. highly recommend if you can afford it XD ✌🏻☝🏻👍🏻"

This product irritated my skin really bad. I bought the whole line and had such bad breakouts and dry skin that it took at least two months to regain even a semblance of normal skin and I only used the line for at best two weeks (but the sunscreen was only once on the face). I was using this on my chest as sunscreen until I started breaking out there too. I have had a bad reaction to nearly all of Pacifica's products and I think I'm done even trying. * The moisturizer works great and smells amazing. However, it's not the best for oily skin. I have combination oil skin and my skin gets very, very oily with this after a few hours. I gave it 4 stars just for that reason. If you have normal or dry skin, I think this would work better. * I received this product for free in a promotion. I tried it for over a week and I do not like how oily it feels and make my skin look. I also found that this moisturizer irritate my eyes and cause my eyes to water. * This daily moisturizer/sunscreen is a good consistency that is easy to apply. It is not too thick and not too thin. However, it leaves my skin looking greasy and burns my eyes as badly as regular sunscreen does. * I originally wanted the Shisiedo sunscreen cause I was told it gives a glow but they were out of stock and I discovered this product on clearance so gave it a chance and I am more than satisfied- it feels so rich on my senior skin and it gives a slight glow ( as well as high sun protection) Easy to use pump * I was trying to find a good spf 50 for summer because of the sun and heat. I like other Pacifica products, but this one isn't the best for me. I have oily, acne prone skin and this feels very greasy on my face, and I have broken out a little more than usual. may be better for someone with dry and/or less sensitive skin. * I recommend this product.

Otherwise, loved it. * Very moisturizing for this 56 yr old face. Sinks in beautifully and is perfect under makeup. Feels very luxurious.  I will continue to buy. Highly recommend. * I think for the price its not really worth it. Although it is very moisturizing, it did not last till the morning. There are so many other creams you can get for a cheaper price that are just as moisturzing or more. Id give this a 3.8 * I'm so happy that this product was included in the 21 days of beauty.

I have tried a lot of soothing and calming products on the market to fix my occasionally irritated skin but so far this one is the only one that doesn't hurt when applied and that actually calms my skin down. I have used both its cream and balm version. They are both great but I like the balm one a little better. * Glides onto the skin nicely and leaves a nice hydrated finish to the skin. Very soothing for dryness without clogging pores * In recent years i've developed excema on my eyelids, chin & ear lobes. I've tried so many moisturizers that claim to help reduce redness and lock in moisture, but it wasn't until I found this product that my skin changed for the better. I bought the 3 pack sample with the facewash and thermal water and fell in love with all. 

First purchased back in September 2022 & still using the same 3 products today. I even tried to change back to some old products that used to work for me and my skin returned to the brittle and scaly old self that used to be. I remain consistent with this brand, and they have shown me love back, my skin soaks this stuff in and doesnt break me out whatsoever. 

Super gentle and refreshing. One of my favorite pros is that it leaves my irritated and stinging skin, smooth and calm. if you have irritated skin that stings, even when you put your moisturizer on it, this product is definitely for you and will help with that sensation. * This is my favorite Avene product! So much that I finished my first tube and bought two more! It has been very helpful for my dry face this winter and I love using it at night over my serums. * Helped razor burn and is super gentle * It help relieve the redness on my irritated neck, little pricey"

Within an hour of applying I could see and feel a difference. My face started healing and skin stopped flaking. Break outs were becoming more controlled (clogging caused by psoriasis's 10x skin growth rate). Arm stopped itching and was no longer red! 

Normally I would never use a thick cream like this for my face! It had no burning and helped soothe my skin immediately. 

Very happy with this product! Helps a lot with soothing my autoimmune disease when everything else tends to flare it (yes even from the derm at months of use of products). * Made eczema worse on my face and boyfriend's hands * I've been using this lotion for over a year now & have repurchased about 6 times! I have VERY sensitive skin, I get hives on my hands/arms, & allergies that make my face skin dry out/flake in the spring. This has worked better than expensive clinique moisturizers & has been a real life saver in my breakouts. A 'con' is that sometimes it pills on my skin, especially if I'm using the cicaplast balm too. I wish it was more product for the price & that squeeze style bottle didnt allow for so much product left inside when you can't squeeze any more out (I've cut multiple of these bottles open to get ALL the product). I'm going to branch out & try a few new eczema products but I would (& have) recommended this one to other people with eczema & still would probably purchase again. * I suffer from facial eczema and have tried a few creams.  This cream is the best for soothing and providing moisture to my face.  Highly recommend! * I have been using this product for 3 months now and can say that this has worked better than any other products ive used and is much cheaper! Very gentle for the face and body. Will say that if it feels like its not working fast enough I would highly recommend the Lipikar body and face wash to pair with it! Those two products together cleared my Ezcema in less than 2 weeks! * Sadly didn't work out for me, made my skin worse and I was red and breaking out badly * I struggle with Versicolor and have for almost 10 years, the doctors couldnt even tell me what to do to help it. It's very similar to psoriasis, its all over my chest, back, neck and scalp. It is very painful at times and if i'm not careful i can scar from scratching too much. I have gone through lotions, serums, even vitamins I thought would help. This lotion was kind of my last hope before going back to the doctor. The first time i put it on, that was the first time in almost 2 years that my chest wasnt scaly, itchy and red. Theres a little discoloration from years of my skin dealing with this, but it actually looks like normal skin. This is a huge insecurity of mine and now i feel i can be ready for summer and actually wear things i want without feeling embarrassed!"

I use it everyday AM and PM, and it leaves my face feeling so smooth and clean without the feeling of a heavy moisturizer. I would compare this to the belif aqua bomb, just even more lightweight. * I have sensitive skin so I was scared to try a new moisturizer. I did break out a little bit the first week (around the chin area) but after using for 2 weeks, my skin is in love !!! Super moisturizing and my skin feels great * I have very oily acne prone skin and it works very well. Not greasy at all, althpugh it is a gel. It goes on smooth and i love it. It does not have SPF so i do use an SPF after i use this. * This product absorbs quickly, but unfortunately, it caused a burning sensation on my skin upon application. It left dark spots on my skin due to burning. I couldn't put anything on for almost a week because it burned so badly. Definitely will not repurchase. I do love other products from Kiehls but this one isn't for me. * I may simply be allergic to an ingredient in this moisturizer as it has many positive reviews, but it burns every time I apply. On a more positive note, I didn't experience any additional breakouts. * In my personal experience (oily t-zone, sensitive dry cheeks) this moisturizer has been excellent. Even though its a gel texture, its shockingly soft and melts into the skin well, not getting that slight stickyness that some gel/oil-free moisturizers tend to have. Im able to use this on both the dry and oily parts of my skin and then I use their barrier repair cream on the drier/sensitive areas of my face and it feels downright refreshing. No irritation but also I dont feel like an oil slick after an hour! No greasyness but still effectively moisturizing, makinng my skin just feel supple and calm. I dont make a lot of money to buy ""luxury"" or just nicer skincare, but I will always splurge on this product as my go-to moisturizer."

This moisturizer is soooo nice and lithtweight but ultra hydrating, leaving 0 greasiness! Highly recommend!
And I love using the eye masks in the morning as I get ready for the day; it perks your skin and eyes right up! * The eye patches didn't do anything for the dark circles under my eyes and the moisturizer wasn't enough for the desert climate that I live in. * One of my favorite moisturizers. My eyes are very sensitive and many moisturizers, and serums cause them to burn if I use them around my face. Not these and I love the moisturizer for morning and night. * My skin is always dry even after trying other moisturizers the next day its super dry.

Horrible! * I wanted something for my face that has sunscreen in it, but I should have stuck with what I had been using (Olay) and just added sunscreen on top.
After using this product for a few days my face looks like I've got mange. * I tried this once and 39 seconds later my eyes were swollen shut and I couldn't breath, not good for sensitive skin like the bottle had stated. * This moisturizer leaves a white cast and it doesn't sit well on the face, it ends up really patchy. The worst thing is that throughout the day my eyes will start to burn. I've given it multiple chances to see if something else was causing this but without fail, everytime I wear it, my eyes will burn/sting (and this is not from the sunscreen getting in my eye directly). * This is a thick moisturizer and doesn't spread well.

The fact it contains the stable form of Vitamin C that most dermatologists prefer to recommend is of course THE reason to use it. I also LOVE that they didn't add fragrance to mask the  normal smell of the vitamin C ingredient. Yes, that odd ""hot dog?"" scent is just what the vitamin C smells like, and it dissipates in less than a minute. * Bought this product about a month ago, I was worried at first about spending so much money, but it was time to drop the dime. I'll be turning 35 soon and my skin was dull, dry and sometimes had red patches that would burn when using other creams, correctors and moisturizers. 
Since using this product my skin looks just as young and fresh as it did in my 20's!
I will definitely be purchasing this again when I run out. * Started using this product about a month ago and I love how dewy and hydrated my skin looks. It has also helped with my skin tone. Im satisfied with the results & will definitely buy again! * Love this product I can not go with out it * Bought this product and I am truly amazed its only been a week and I HONESTLY am noticing results!

You CANNOT layer it with anything, or even slighty brush against your skin without it pilling up and getting everywhere. That being said, I have very sensitive acne prone skin, and this did not irritate my skin except for around my eyes, and did not leave much white cast. * I have used this moisturizer for YEARS! I suffer from dry skin and all other moisturizers would cause my face to have little white flakes on it. After I started using this it never happened again. * I was given this as a gift and at first i didnt know it was a sunscreen and used it for a while as just a moisturizer, eventually I looked this up on the app and only realized then. But overall this product is really good and feels great on my skin, one thing id change it the packaging, after long term use the film on the grey cap came off and i had it all over my hands that ended up on my face after i applied. It was really annoying. Obviously i didnt buy it but still it is crazy expensive.. like tf 80?💀 * Love this spf non greasy and can be worn under makeup .

I have been using oil moisturizers as I thought they were lighter and absorbed quickly. But this cream is super light and absorbs quickly. it doesn't feel greasy and lasts all day. Now I can really feel the difference when I don't use it. If you are hesitant between this product and the triple repair one for extra dry skin I'd go with this one first. The other is a lot heavier and doesn't absorb as well * Again the best body lotion ever! But what to do when the pump won't get to the remaining 4 ounces of lotion. I have a solution! I cut the the top off with a knife, the take a spatula or kitchen knife and scrape it out and into a 4 ounce bell canning jar. Perfect size & then nothing is wasted. * I have the La Roche-Posay face moisturizer, which I love, so I figured I'd give this a shot. I only use this on my arms because they are the driest part of my body and WOW. My arms are so smooth and soft that I might stop using my other body moisturizer! * This is an amazing basic cleanser for any skin type! I have dry/combo sensitive skin that's acne prone and this works well for me. It isn't drying and leaves my face feeling nice and clean. I can use it around my eyes without irritation and that's a plus! It also doesn't break me out which is a huge factor for me. It's also fragrance free. I love the ingredients and how it has a pump that locks. * I really love it will definitely purchase again but like others have said it has a smell to it almost like a cheap mayo smell 😭 it does leave a greasy feel up until it absorbs into your skin but the upside is it leaves your skin sooo soft!"

This contour cream works to tighten skin and really makes a difference in my jawline and in my cheeks. My skin is an investment and with these products the payoff is amazing! ❤️ * I really wanted to try this based on the great reviews but unfortunately after one use, I'm left with hives and I feel sunburned. There must be an ingredient that I'm allergic to. * I would buy this product again * I'm not sure if the product I got was old, but I was super stoked about trying it. In the pictures advertising the product, it looks like a white creamy substance, but this is yellow and crumbly and hard to rub in. Bummed. * I have seen a visual appearance on my face, smooth, and tightening! * Skin looks so much better * I have been noticing some lines on my forehead and other products were having little impact.

I've dabbled in other moisturizers, but nothing ever has the same consistency throughout the day as ky origins regime. I'm hooked!! * I have dry skin. I had high expectations for this product……. It didnt absorb and made my skin look so dry…. It also peeled off. It hust stayed on top of my skin and peeled off once dry.

I enjoy using most on damp skin before bed almost as a sleep mask to wake up with soft & plump skin. I can see this being a little suffocating if you have oily or acne prone skin, but for its purpose to help your barrier for us in the dry skin club, I def think it serves it purpose. The texture is nice & soft, applies well & does pill. I'm honestly a fan! (gifted by Peter Thomas Roth in exchange for honest review) * Received complimentary from Peter Thomas Roth Skincare. This hyaluronic moisturizer is so light weight and does a really good job of keeping my skin moisturized. Perfect for my dry skin and works really well under makeup.

Two starts only because it's moisturizing. * Gifted by Peterthomasroth. Amazing moisturizer, I love it. It leaves my skin feeling super soft and hydrated in the morning when I use it at night. The texture is really nice feeling on the skin, and almost leaves a cooling feeling to skin, which I love! It also helps making the skin look more glowy which is plus.

I noticed the very next day I started getting micro bumps that resembled milia or granulomatous. I stopped wearing make up and switched to a gentle cleanser to see if those were the reasons however I remained applying the sunscreen to obviously help protect my face. To my surprise, my skin was only getting worse. It was starting to burn and itch. I've been allergy tested, and I don't have any. The day I didn't use the sunscreen, my skin condition immediately disappeared, so I went to look at the ingredients list. I don't know if Origins is using the oils from grapefruit, lemon and orange for fragrance purposes, but it does not list anywhere that they have extracted the furanocoumarins. After meeting with my dermatologist, I was advised that the citrus oils used in the sunscreen caused photosensitivity, and burned/ irritated my skin.

Started using this product again this week remembered why I love this! My face is becoming rehydrated again. The brightness is coming back and my rosacea is subsiding. I do have sensitive skin and this seems to do the trick to balance pH levels. If you have tried other products with no luck, try this product. Not every product fits everyone but this one is definitely worth the try. To me... worth every cent🙏 * 'My daughter is 14 and this product has been great for her acne * I love to try new products so I've experimented with a number of daily moisturizers with SPF like Drunk Elephant and Unseen Sunscreen and always come back to this Murad holy grail. It doesn't leave a white cast, is moisturizing, non-greasy, and doesn't pill under my makeup. I use this daily and a bottle lasts me roughly 4 months. I'm honestly shocked at other reviews saying they broke out as I have acne prone skin and never have but YMMV. * This is a decent sunscreen, rubs in fine and makes my skin soft. However this burns my eyes soooo bad. Obviously I know to not get sunscreen in my eyes, but it doesn't matter how carefully I put it on, my eyes burn. I have very sensitive & dry eyes and it just doesn't work. The Tula one in the yellow bottle, is the one I continue to go back too. * I was very excited to try this but was disappointed to find the results being similar to a drug store brand product not to mention this product caused my skin to break out and become oily. Never had those issues with my skin before starting to use this. Also the product just pours out of the bottle causing you to end up wasting product every time you use it which makes you run out a lot faster than you would expect. * I have heard great things about Murad so I finally decided to treat myself to this moisturizer. I wanted to love it SO bad but my skin has BLOWN UP with acne so bad, it's starting to really get to me. I used to struggle with acne but it had gotten to be almost non-existed until I bought this. At first I thought my pregnancy hormones had caused my flare up, and it could be a contributor, but this is really the only new piece of my skincare regimen and it seems like others have had the same bad experience as me too. Will be throwing it away and buying my old moisturizer. * As always, every experience can be different but I'll tell you mine: I have very sensitive skin , dry to normal, rarely have acne besides the occasional pimple. When I started using this, my face broke out like a crunch bar. TONS of bumps and several pimples. I started a new night cream at the same time so I wasn't sure, but as soon as I stopped using this my face cleared. It was pretty instant, at the end of the day the bumps were the worst and I would wash my face and wake up to no bumps (not what happens with typical acne). If you haven't heard of acne cosmetica, google it that way you can watch out for it with this product or any others.

I wish this worked out. * After having my baby, part of my postpartum recovery included extremely dry skin around my chin and T-zone area. It was SOOOOOO bad. My makeup application was the worst showing patchy skin. I tried so many things to help, including high-end luxurious products, but nothing worked until I tried this for weeks. I saw it changed the texture of my skin that included smoother and moisturized skin. I love it so much, I just bought a second one. The scent is also light. Nothing too crazy. This was good to my sensitive skin. Highly recommend!!!! * This product did make my skin feel feel and look amazing.  However, it also caused acne breakouts that I hadn't experienced in many years.  For that reason, I can't use this product.  I wasn't prone to breakouts so it was a bit surprising. * Smooth and penetrates well. Skin feels soft and smooth * Used 2 full bottles and feel very dry. Not the product for me. * The concentration of alcohol in this is too high. It will create the ""tightening"" effect but that's actually the denatured alcohol sucking water out of your skin.

It's tacky for a few minutes until it dries down, but it's so hydrating. I occasionally will dab it on drier parts of my face over a more lightweight moisturizer as well if I need it. It's also a HUGE tub. I'm nowhere near the bottom. * Love this moisturizer so much, it has a similar texture & feel to neutrogena hydro boost but this feels & smells even better. Favorite product to use! * I love this product so much, I cant believe how much you get and a little really goes a long way.

Perfect for my acne prone skin * I have never had a cream so light, yet so beneficial to my complexion!  I've been usung this TonyMoly cream forvover a month, day and night!

I liked it so much i bought several small tubes for travel from Ipsy and the huge 10 ounce jar from Ulta! * So much product for such a great price. It smells so amazing and leaves my skin feeling super hydrated but not oily at all, it absorbs into my skin so well."

I had previously I lpurchased the mini size because I wanted to try it out before I received the travel size. It is such a creamy consistency. I love the fact that it doesn't leave my skin greasy or sticky. It is very hydrating. Very low scent and it is very pleasant * I'm still up in the air about this one. I got to try the sample size and the formula is amazing. I love that it is a gel-cream and dries down very easily.  I do wish that it had a scent. This one is unscented and to me it's still has an unscented lotion smell I guess is how you could describe it.  I haven't noticed any differences in my skin but I do love how soft my skin feels after using this. * I enjoyed trying this moisturizer.  My skin felt hydrated even after one use.   I didn't find that it had a much of a scent to it.  I love that It melted right into my skin and left me with a luminous glow.    I will definitely be adding this into my daily routine. * I've been using Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Water Cream. The texture is lightweight and absorbs quickly, which is perfect for my combination skin. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated without any greasy residue. I also love the refreshing, cooling sensation it gives upon application.

The formula has made my skin look plumper and more radiant, and I've noticed an improvement in the overall texture. It wears beautifully under makeup, acting almost like a primer, and helps keep my skin looking dewy all day.

The packaging is sleek and luxurious, typical of Charlotte Tilbury products. Although it's a bit on the pricier side, a little goes a long way, and the results are definitely worth the investment. If you're looking for a hydrating cream that delivers lasting moisture and a beautiful glow, I highly recommend the Magic Water Cream! * Charlotte Tilbury Magic Water Cream is a skincare gem! This lightweight moisturizer is incredibly hydrating and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and plump without any greasy residue. The unique formula gives my complexion a dewy glow, and I love the subtle, uplifting scent. It works well under makeup, creating a smooth canvas that enhances my overall look. After using it for a few weeks, I've noticed my skin feels softer and looks more radiant. Overall, it's a must-have in my skincare routine! Highly recommend! * Disclaimer: I did receive this product for free for a review by influencer. Had a very nice smell and also texture. The packaging is pretty well basic but still nice. It looks great underneath foundations but towards effectiveness I have not had enough time to truly understand the formula. I did not have any breakouts while using it so which is a great thing to me. It is a good simple Skin care product ￼ * Had a very nice smell and also texture.

I like how the product is provided. The moisturizer itself caused skin irritation after I used appropriate face cleanser foe skin type. Not for eczema prone or sensitive skin! * The formula is fine—nothing amazing—and there are similar moisturizers at a more affordable pricepoint. I have combo sensitive skin and it didn't irritate my skin. I do really like it when i mix it with my retinol oil at night as it helps dry down the oil faster and keep in the moisture. The packaging is my favorite part with the pump top. When i'm out of this, i'll refill it with my cetaphil night cream. I got it when it was half off but i still think it's too expensive for what it is. * Ive been eyeing this product for a while but was put off by the price. I finally bought it on a whim one day and im absolutely in love! It feels so good on my face and doesnt feel  greasy! My skins appearance has overall improved as well! * This is seriously the best moistirizer ever made. Love it so much . My skin is flawless * This stuff makes my foundation look flawless! * Very hydrating, I mix this with my foundation. * Very pushy salesperson at ulta tried to sell me on this by saying it would clear up rosacea, eczema, and psoriasis, and that this will be my holy grail moisturizer. Bold statement to make to someone with psoriasis. Took the offered sample and used on the back of one hand. Within 20 minutes, it was as if all the moisture had been sucked out of that area and a fresh psoriasis patch began forming. 🙃 Would probably never have purchased after the pushy salesperson, but absolutely will never purchase anything from this brand after the reaction."

I love a milky SPF for layering other products but even with a heavy moisturizer underneath it dried my skin and caused peeling and flaking * I go through sunscreen like its nothing because I tend to burn easily. This one is lightweight and comfortable. I wear it under makeup without any problems like some cause. The only downside is the price for the size youre getting, but otherwise I love this product and will be buying it again. * I love the texture and feel of this sunscreen and it doesn't cause acne for my very sensitive skin. Downside is it goes quickly and the price point is too high. * I have sensitive, dry skin. I'm newer to using sunscreen daily. I researched many brands and this had great reviews, so I bought it hoping for the best. Using it over my serums has helped them work their magic. My dark spots have eased up and my expression lines are less prominent. My skin is more hydrated and plump. I plan to keep using this because ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" and it works perfectly for me! Also, sometimes when I introduce a new product, my skin has a bad reaction (redness, irritation, breakout) and this sunscreen has not caused any negative reactions. * It is not as good as people are saying in the reviews. Yes, it blends out well but it just stays on top of your skin and leaves you with a greasy feeling. Also, for the price… definitely not worth it. I couldnt even finish the whole bottle because it was breaking me out so bad. Some people are saying its good for people with acne prone skin but as someone with acne prone skin, yeah it is not it. I gave it to a relative because i didnt want to be wasteful and even they didnt like it and theyre honestly not that picky with their skincare. Korean sunscreens are the way to go especially if youre acne prone and the prices are a lot more cheaper! * This has been my daily sunscreen since the start of this year and don't plan on changing anytime soon! * This is the acne friendly spf out there. I workout outside everyday in FL, so finding an SPF that was water and sweat resistant was important. I have tried so many, but thankfully I found this one. I've had so many bad breakouts from SPFs that claimed to be acne safe but this one actually is."

Love it * My skin feels smooth and moistureized. * This is my night cream ever night.  It works, It does not irritate my skin. What's not to love about that? * I received a sample of this and did wear sunscreen during the day. The first night it went on everything seemed fine. It went on with no problem. The second day I felt a little tight itching? By the third day I started seeing peeling around my nose and my face felt itchy and burny. Not an overwhelming itch but enough to recognize I'm having a bad reaction. Peeling, itching and a slight burning sensation. I didn't use makeup the first two days but when I put makeup on the third day, it went on blotchy and I could see the irritation on my cheeks, mostly below my eye area. I'm Pacific Islander, NC30 and in my 40's, sadly this product is not for me. * Product is usually good. But got a bad batch and felt bad so I didn't bring it back.  Cream is old and had been sitting on the shelf for a while."

I would cry if FAB ever discontinued this product. 1000% would recommend. * This is a great moisturizer super lightweight better for like oily or skin types. But I like it as a quick little water cream to add to whatever else I'm using for the day. Smells delicious and love coconut so for me, this is a must have! * This product is amazing, it's so light weight and smells amazing. Would definitely recommend * i really loved the product and how it made my skin feel but i went thru the whole thing in one month!!! i can't be buying this every month for that price :/ * If you have acne or just skin in general you NEED this is in your life! * I wanted to love this. The texture is great- very lightweight, dries nicely, and no stickiness, heaviness, dryness, or tightness on my skin after use! Unfortunately, on application, my skin immediately started stinging. I have some rosacea on my cheeks, and this moisturizer made it look and feel awful. The stinging stopped fairly quickly, but the redness persisted. I initially thought it could be from the combination of layering products, but I applied the moisturizer to a clean face with no other product, and it still stung and increased my redness. I have not had this issue with other FAB products- usually they play nicely with my skin type and other products in my routine- so I was very disappointed. If your skin is less sensitive, it might work well for you (again- great texture!), but given that FAB are the ""sensitive skin specialists,"" I have a hard time recommending it."

Im someone who always gets compliments on my skin, not a brag I just take care good care of my skin and know my ingredients. Looking at this I thought it would be amazing. The ingredients really are great in all of their products. Please dont be fooled like I was. I believe the ingredients are good but the quality and purity of the ingredients may be off because I dont think my skin has ever been worse. Now I must spend months repairing my moisture barrier and getting back to glass skin. Please avoid and if I may recommend something else. The Clinique Moisture Surge overnight mask, it has saved my skin from times like this. I will be returning all of my Goodlight and reupping on that. * i love everything about this! it is so moisturizing but not thick. i think it also doubles as a makeup primer. 100% reccomend, i tried something new and cheating on this product did not end well for me. * I usually use Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream, but this moisturizer is just as amazing and for a fraction of the price! It's so Moisturizing but doesn't leave you feeling greasy. * This moisturizer is truly amazing! I've been using the Tula moisturizer for a long time but it wasn't working for me anymore so I started trying this one and I have no regrets!! I have combo sensitive skin and I found this product to be so hydrating and it gives a supple look and it looks great under makeup. Definitely recommend trying! * I am absolutely amazed by this cream! As someone with combination/ leaning towards oily skin, this has been one of the best moisturizers I've used in a while. Love that it uses truly clean ingredients. Texture and smell are great, I have no notes. Can be used any time of year! * The reviews fooled me again. I thought this was a lightweight moisturizer. It felt very heavy and greasy on my skin. I will be switching back to the blue Neutrogena moisture and try this out again during the cold and dry months! * Absolutely in love with this moisturizer! This has been the holy grail in helping my sensitive and irritated skin get back on track. I love the feel and the way it sits on the skin after application.

Its definitely a must-try! My skin has never looked as healthy and plump as it does now and it truly minimizes fine lines and wrinkles! Everyone compliments and asks what skin products I use in my regime and its this product that has changed my skin suppleness, texture, and glow! I have always been a fan of Peter Thomas Roth products because you do see the results right away. This moisturizer though has become a necessity in my daily routine and blows any others I have used out of the water! If you are beginning to see aging in your face or neck, or you want to prevent any signs of aging I definitely recommend this product! You will not be disappointed! Healthy skin on your face is the most important foundation of all! * While this did not cause pimples, it caused hives on my face. I missed in the Ingredients that there was both soy and wheat. It took a week for the hives to go away after one use. I couldn't tell what the texture was like over the hives. * I had gotten a sample packet of this cream and I absolutely love how soft and smooth my face is! Looking forward to buying the full size soon:) * Love this new formula!! The price is also great!? * I love how it keeps my dry skin moisturized without drying away minutes after.

At first, I though this was only a body lotion, but it's really good on my face, too!! It worked super well for my combination skin.

I've repurchased this moisturizer at least 4 times and I always have a backup! * I love that this moisturizer is buildable. You xan relaly control how much you need. It feels great on my skin and my skin is noticeably more plump. I love it! * I am acne-prone but need a moisturizer for skin dryness, especially during the winter when the cold wind easily dries out your skin. After using this moisturizer, I have had several instances of bad luck with getting a new pimple the next morning. The texture and application (no burning) of this product are fine. It does its job to moisturize the skin. However, not without suffering more blemishes sadly. I picked this while trying to find noncomedogenic moisturizers with clean ingredients according to Yuka, but my mom helped point out to me later this has vegetable oil in it… Cool! 🙃 * its just perfect and a little goes a long way * I dont really know what people are saying about this product, most people are saying its lightweight and non greasy but it feels so heavy, sticky, and greasy on my face, maybe just not for me but I won't be buying this again * I have sensitive skin and this works well for me. Love that it isnt too heavy on my combo/acne prone skin * I was hoping this product would work well on my acne-prone skin, but it doesn't seem to do much for me. It doesn't absorb very well into the skin so the more you use the more ends up sitting on your face. The claims about this moisturizer being pre-biotic don't seem to mean much. Hero specializes in products for acne and acne-prone skin, so I assumed this moisturizer would work well in my routine and be hydrating but I was disappointed."

I honestly wouldnt bother using these under your eyes because the adhesive is so strong it pulls at your skin even with wetting them. They did work well on my smile lines and 11 lines but they just soften the wrinkles, my results only lasted about 1 week. Personally I'd invest in a good quality eye cream over using these patches. * I love this idea and if it worked it would be cool but they don't stay on - followed directions to a ""t"" and still fell off within the hour.

I've been using ketoconazole shampoo which definitely helps but I still found myself needing to use cortisone cream on my face (gross!!). So I was researching moisturizers good for dermatitis and while Supermello isn't specifically marketed for dermatitis (it does list eczema) I thought it sounded like it may help. I am SO GLAD I gave it a chance!!!!! its been about 2 weeks now and my face is looking the best it's looked in several years. Patches that I thought were stubborn acne have been clearing up and are almost totally gone. the hydration level us just right so I feel moisturizes but don't get greasy as the day goes on. It does smell REALLY lovely with the light vanilla/Marshmallow aroma. Definitely worth trying if you have skin conditions that make you red/itchy! * I got this as a sample and wowww the smell is so good! It's very creamy so a little goes along way! Im so happy I got it as a sample because now Im definately buying more. I love this brand and it also makes my skin glowy and so soft. I love how my skin feels I usually use their Vitamin C then put on this cream and it leaves my skin poreless and soft. * My skin burns from water, I swear. I am incredibly sensitive to everything. My skin chaps, get red and raw, itches and burns. I have tried most of the major 'sensitive' skin moisturizers high to low end, and this is the absolute winner. Keeps my skin moisturized and smells great. I have found it does not do well under makeup so I only use at night and for the first time, thats enough moisture for me. * I've been using this moisturizer for a few years now and I LOVE it! This is the only lotion I've found that leaves me with no irritation or redness. Highly recommend! * I've gone through a couple jars of this moisturizer - it's incredibly rare to find one that truly doesn't clog my pores, and despite some highly comedogenic ingredients, this one surprisingly does not break me out at all. Also makes my skin incredibly soft. Unfortunately, however, as I continued to use this, noticed my pores becoming increasingly large and more noticeable, and my skin texture getting worse and worse. Stopped using for a few weeks (keeping everything else in my routine the same) and my  texture is looking quite a bit better. So, no go for me. * Wow just wow. I am on my second container of this and from a girl with sensitive skin i cant say enough good things! * I have been using this moisturizer for about 14 months now. The changes to my skin health have blown me away. I have very sensitive skin and have been diagnosed with psorasis on my face and scalp, rosacea, and facial keratosis. I have invested so much money in dermatologist recommended skincare products but everything I tried aggravated my skin and worsened my psoriasis or rosacea. This is one of the only products my skin hasn't reacted to and was what convinced me to try other kinship products. I can't make any promises about what results you will get from this product since everyone's skin is different but I would suggest trying this if you are dealing with sensitive skin or psoriasis. It has a lightweight texture and a faint vanilla scent that dissapated soon after application. I really appreciate that kinship only uses plant extracts to scent there products instead of essential oils or fragrance, which are much stronger and very irritating to sensitive skin. I  also like that instead of having numerous of actives in one product, this just has hyaluronic acid and a stable vitamin c ester, THDA, that if safe for sensitive skin and addresses hyperpigmentation. Since using this product for over a year, I've had so much less skin irritation, my hyperpigmentation has noticably improved, and I have a smoother skin texture with less keratosis bumps. This moisturizer has outperformed ones that are 3 times the price. The 3.5 oz size is a great value considering a little goes a long way with this product. I have switched to using almost excusively kinship products and having tried almost all their products at this point. This is definately in the top 3 along along with the spf 32 and the papya cleanser. I've noticed that kinship products regularly go on sale every couple months on ulta. I would suggest waiting for a sale to grap a couple of their products if the prices are a little outside your budget like they are for mine."

No breakouts and i love it! * So ive used almost the entire jar because hey it was an investment. The texture is similar to Neutrogena water cream, and acts the same. I bought this cream for its ingredients because i love anything with sea weed or algae. Its an ok cream for eveyday if you live in a mild climate, not for extreme weather. But upon applying to the face it smells so bad and that's saying a lot from because i lost my smell from covid. I can only imagine what others smell….. i wore this cream for a 14 hour work day outside in freezing weather and it did not protect or last very long. 
On s nomal day in more mild climate its ok. You only need a little bit otherwise it sits on the face snd takes time to absorb, on hot day you'll start sweating whike it absorbs , not cool. 
Overall I would not repurchase or recommend this product. I love Osea body products and the facial serum but this is a pass for me. Ill finish the jar for sure because im not going towaste, but will be adding face oil to protect in cold weather."

This moisturizer is the first perfect combo of moisturizer and SPF I have found without it making my T zone worse or my chin flaky! Def buying another tube! * I have and oily T section and my skin becomes especially red or dry around my cheeks and chin right before my period. I've tried a lot of SPF and finally found one that doesn't leave me ultra shiny and oily.  I really like this product and will keep using it! Only downside is that I think some of the oils in the product settled and the last couple of uses did leave my skin somewhat shiny but other than that, my skin was left soft and even toned! * Contains harmful chemicals that damage our coral reefs. Please make smart consumer choices, this sunscreen is not environmentally safe and my face broke out when using it :( * this sunscreen gave me such a healthy glove, and my skin did not feel oily or greasy at!!!! I used to have the Laroche poosay (I hope i spelled it right) sunscreen, and it would make my skin shiny, but it all oily. I have normal skin and I really love this product. * I'm in my 30's and have always had acne prone, oily skin. A few years ago, I was able to clear up my skin with a strict morning and night routine that includes prescription creams, but every time I would try using SPF, I would immediately break out. I've tried dozens of prestige and drugstore brands! This moisturizer with SPF is the first that hasnt caused a single breakout. I've been using it for over a month now and I will continue to as long as its on shelves. * This product is okay as a moisturizer and sunscreen but leaves you shiny looking. It also does not work well under makeup at all. I learned the hard way after I was almost completely done with my makeup and it began lifting and leaving ugly peeling patches when i used a powder brush. For the price, theres way better sunscreens out there. The murad sunscreen in a blue bottle is about the same size and the same price but works amazing. * I switched to this sunscreen and my pores and oily skin were controlled also my skin felt amazing! I could t rebuy it because I was pregnant but whenever I get my hands on this again I would gladly stick to this only. The only con is the size and price"

Recently I bought a $150 moisturizer claiming it was magic, when THIS..PUR Cloud Cream (for a fraction of the price)..was all I've ever wanted and needed. It is the silkiest product and it just melts into the skin like a drink for your pores. I mix it with a dab of Charlotte Tilbury ""beautiful skin"" foundation and I feel like a million bucks. Immediate confidence boost. It's just enough tint to perfect the redness from my acne and scars...and it leaves the most gorgeous finish, like I just got back from the medspa and my skin is plump, hydrated, and GLOWING. I got this as a sample from Ulta and I had to come back here, buy the full size immediately, and leave a review. I knew nothing about it so when I searched it up I was expecting this to be much more expensive. A double win for it's attainable price!! Please never discontinue. * I am allergic to tocopherol acetate, and this is the only moisturizer I can find at Ulta without it. Thank goodness it works well. Feels nice, not greasy. Absorbs quickly, and isnt strong smelling. * This is one of the only things I can use on my face! I dont have to worry about my face sweating when
I wear it. It is lightweight and is scent free! * Okay so. I have extremely finicky, super sensitiveGr, combination skin. Ive tried lots of moisturizer brands such as Clarins, CosRx, Drunk Elephant, and Beauty Counter. As great as they worked, my skin sucked up the creams too fast and didnt last me throughout the whole day. Serums helped, but would cause me to break out in consistent trouble spots. The way it sat on my skin did NOT feel even. Rough versus smooth. And when using foundation, you could see the different textures. 

Since using Pür Cloud Cream, I can honestly say this is one of the most amazing products Ive ever tried?? 
When applying, a little is a lot. It smoothes out so evenly, feels cold and refreshing right off the bat. I let it sit about a minute or two, did a test feel of my skin. Let me tell you, the texture was IMMEDIATELY consistent over my whole face. Trouble areas such as the nose, above my lips, smile lines, and eyebrows were rich and hydrated. Im actually kind of shook how quickly, too.

When using foundation, it gave an airbrushed feel and look. My skin still felt smooth! And was definitely still hydrated. 

So excited for trying this product. Will DEFINITELY buy it again. * Lightweight and goes on smooth * Love this for my acne prone skin, it soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated. Not oily and clogged at all like some moisturizers. * All of the PUR products have been really nice for my dry, sensitive skin. These have become holy grail products for me over the last year."

Great product! * Truly oil free. I have oily skin so I can immediately pick up on oily products. Very light weight and good texture. Best I've used so far. * Great product * I had started using the Bareminerals Skin Longevity line but didn't quite care for the daily moisturizer with sunscreen so I bought this product.  I am 60 yoa and have struggled with acne and skin problems since I was a teenager.  I believe it's mostly due to bad genes because my sisters and daughter also had acne problems. This moisturizer absorbs well, but because it is oil free, it doesn't leave my skin shiny or greasy looking. It makes my skin feel fresh and smooth. I do not look my age and I believe that using these Baremineral products contribute to my better looking skin. * I use this daily after cleansing. It is light-weight but easily covers my face & neck. It isn't oily at all. I have used other products in the past. They cause breakouts and leave my face feeling greasy all day or soak in immediately & don't create a good foundation. * Best moisture I have ever used. A little goes a long ways.  My skin has never felt or looked this good. Absolutely love this product.  Please don't ever stop selling this."

I noticed how smooth, how easy to smile it was, and what a big difference it was from the previous years. Using the whole set it's very expensive but if you are careful and use them as indicated they last.  I bought mine on October 2022 and run out of them in February 2023 bravo!!!  And that was because I had to travel to different countries so I ended taking small amounts in my containers when I when to Europe. Then on my way back I travel to Mexico so I took all the bottles because I was going to stay there 3 months. Then my set got finished there   I checked in the fine stores in Mexico but there were no Refills so I had to I'm wait till I return to USA to buy them. I'm strongly recommending the Lancôme Absolute products they all wonderful! Use them carefully and daily! * I love this product, and I've tried quite a few high end moisturizers. I'm 52 a post menopausal. I only gave it 4* because of the price, and the fragrance.  Most over the age of 50 will likely remember a bottle of White Shoulders sitting on their grandmother or mother's vanity, and that's what the smell of this cream reminds me of. Very floral and not just roses. I can live with the price, but I would definitely give it 5* if Lancôme would make a fragrance free version. The fragrance doesn't linger, but the smell reminds me of what old women smelled like when I was a child."

Texture of cream felt like light face lotion and went on just the same. I've used it twice as an over night mask and I woke up with dry skin. My Elemis night cream is 5x more nourishing than this ""face mask"" cream. * I live in the Arctic and the cold sucks any moisture out of my skin. I have very sensitive skin prone to breakouts from moisturizers and new products. Basically if you touch it, it's going to have issues. I received a sample of this with my last makeup order and this stuff is amazing! I have been using it as my daily moisturizer and my skin is soft, hydrated, and most of all clear! I will be adding this to my daily routine. * I got this in a sample when it first launched and fell in love! however since I've gone through almost an entire full size jar, its just not hydrating enough for my skin even though I am very oily! I have acne prone skin and am super picky with ingredients so I had super high hopes, but it sadly fell flat. on goes my search for my favorite all day & night moisturizer 🥲 * This made my skin soft and smooth! Felt like my pores were minimized and skin hydrated! I needed something Hydrating for winter that dried my skin out but not overly heavy or greasy * Caused small red bump breakout using with the essense lotion so i would recommend using this alone after face wash. Absolutely love the feel and smell of this. Face never felt so soft. * i went into ulta wanting to buy the first aid beauty moisturizer but it was sold out. one of the employee's recommended this one to me and i figured id give it a try since neutrogena discountinued my normal moisturizer and i needed to find a replacement. its been like 2 weeks and im honestly not that impressed by it. for the price, i was expecting more but i still woke up dry a couple nights and my face doesnt feel as hydrated as i would like. it didnt break me out though and it doesnt make my skin oily so those are some good things about it."

It provides gentle exfoliation, intense hydration, and results in astonishingly soft and smooth skin. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula ensures lasting moisture throughout the day. Additionally, it is fragrance-free and soothing, making it perfect for sensitive skin. Absolutely adore it! * I love to use this lotion when my skin feels really dry, especially in the cold months. I also like to use it when my hands when they get super dry. It deeply hydrates my skin. * My daughter suffers from severe dry skin and this is the only product that works wonders for her! It's incredibly light weight and non greasy which is perfect for applying after a shower.  Will be repurchasing again! * AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid is a must I have in my bag now a day. It helps exfoliates, and deeply hydrates to uncover softer, smoother skin which as a 30ish woman is so needed. I love that it's fragrance free and works with your body. * I like to think of the AmLactin Daily Nourish Lotion with 12% Lactic Acid AHA as my go-to post-pool or beach essential. It's a lifesaver for my skin, especially after spending hours in the water. My skin tends to get super dry after swimming, and this lotion really comes in handy! * I can't believe it took me so long to find this amazing product. I will have it a part of my skin routine forever now! Such a great lotion for my whole body. Highly recommend purchasing if you have dry and sensitive skin. Game changing product so excited I found it! * As someone with dry and flaky skin, I've tried countless lotions over the years, but none have worked as effectively as this one.

The lotion has a rich, creamy texture that absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. My skin feels immediately hydrated and smooth after applying it."

If Europe can ban Endocrine disruptors why cant we. 
This is like the only ""clean brand"" in the states. So dissapponting.. * I have combo acne prone skin for reference. 
This is like a light watery lotion but absorbs like a rich cream. It soaks right in and paces a velvety, supple feeling that I love. Sometimes my skin is drier so I could see me being able to use this during the day also without being too heavy. It does have a scent. It's like candy strawberry and flowers. It's light and goes away very shortly. You only need a little of this because it spreads so well. It can be easy to go overboard. I think this is definitely worth the money given the ingredients, packaging and how long this will last. Especially compared to other creams. I don't breakout but wake up with super soft, nourished skin. * I want to love this product so badly but the fragrance/essential oils in this caused my eczema to flare up. I'm so sad but I know it's on me for buying something with fragrance, natural or not. Otherwise I think it's a nice product it wasn't drying or anything and the texture is really nice just wish they had a fragrance free version. I will stick with the vegan ceremide cream"

Even the one my dermatologist prescribed! I went out on a limb to try this 2 in 1 sunscreen and it did not disappoint. Great mattifying and no white cast (I'm a brown skin gal) yet moisturizing. I took this on vacation and it withstood the very hot heat and sun. Two thumbs up for me. * My previous tube was great. Mattified the skin. Absorbed quickly. It did not make my skin oily. This newest tube is not good. While it still absorbs quickly it does not mattify my skin. I am very oily in a couple of hours if not before. I must note that i do shake the tube before use so i dont think im missing anything. * I used this as a cheaper alternative toy usual SPF  but it was greasy and broke me out. If i dont shake it i can see the oil. * I bought this sunscreen on accident because I thought it was a free gift and didn't check until I picked it up in store. However, I decided to use it because I needed a new sunscreen and surprisingly, this worked very well for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it sits on top of my other skin care products very well. This is also the first sunscreen that hasn't irritated my skin or burned my eyes which I truly appreciate because every sunscreen I've worn in the past had an extremely painful reaction on my eyes. I plan on repurchasing. * I use this product for daily use. It is lightweight and keeps your face clear and oil free. * i'm so glad i found this sunscreen! beginning with the biggest pros for me- i've seen no new breakouts, doesn't pill, and feels like nothing on my skin. i really hate when i can feel an spf on my face but with this product my skin feels light and clean. pilling and clinging to dry patches is very annoying and i've noticed ZERO pilling/exaggerating of dry patches. 

the few cons i have are very nitpicky- fairly strong smell and isn't mattifying. the smell is almost floral but mostly is just a normal sunscreen smell, which isnt a huge deal to me but might be too much for those sensitive to fragrance. i also wouldn't consider this a mattifying products which i actually prefer. theres little to no added shine but again, not very mattifying.

overall i'm so glad i finally found an spf that works on my skin! * Considering I have very oily skin, this didnt moisturize my skin at all. I had to use it as a straight up sunscreen over my regular moisturizer which defeated the purpose for me. It was defined mattifying to the point of drying."

My forehead bumps comeback when i dont use it. I dont know what these other reviewers are talking about when they say it breaks them out? Maybe you're washing your face wrong or your face wash isnt meant for your skin type, or youre allergic to something in the toner, idk. But i love this toner. Ive used others and this one is by far my favorite! You must try it for yourself! Dont get scared by these other reviewers are saying.

Definitely get if you want that and because it is clean beauty * This product is a staple in my skin care regimen. I have combination skin and it levels everything out. It is moisturizing and doesnt dry my skin. * i have repurchased this product again and again, i buy 2 or 3 at a time. no other toner has ever compared. i don't feel like myself in the morning until i've used my good light toner. if you have combo to dry skin TRY THIS TONER, i recommend it to everyone i know. * After application this makes the skin have such a beautiful glow. But when i wake up in the morning my chin and forehead is covered in bumps and white heads. I love the glow it gives, but not all the texture.

It also doesn't sit well under any make-up, even a just light skin tint. The smell is strong, but it honestly just smells like soap so that wasn't an issue for me and I kind of liked it. * This product is light and smells good.  I love that it has SPF. * I've used it for over 10 years. There's been changes with it over the years, but my skin soaks it up like a sponge and leaves me glowing. * Broke me out in hives! I have sensitive skin and for 3 days my skin was a flame. It finally erupted into hives on the 3rd day. Everything irritated my skin after using this. Do not try this product if you have sensitive skin. Opt for Dermalogica. * New formulation is terrible. 
I've been using this moisturizer for years! I always get compliments on my skin, it's been my go to forever. I even mix a little of it into my foundation the past few years when i want a more sheer coverage. 

They changed the formula and this one is not a winner. It instantly pills. Doesn't absorb. Right after putting it on, my face feels dry. I am so so disappointed and on the hunt for a new moisturizer. * I love this whole positively radiant line from the cleanser to the gel moisturizer it's all very good and didn't irritate my very sensitive skin which the oat line meant for sensitive skin, did. this is my favorite stuff. * NOT a fan of the new formula. It smells like tart green apple candy and feels greasier/sitting on top of my skin. I'm also annoyed they are branding this like it's the same old formula just in updated packaging when it is definitely not the same product anymore. I compared them directly and the percentages of ingredients are different, and the new product is a lower weight. I wish they acknowledged/provided reasoning for the changes, otherwise I have to assume it's now a lower quality product and a victim of shrinkflation. I will be changing to a new daily moisturizer."

It was recommended to me because they were out of stock of my go-to product (a different brand). Upon applying a thin layer of Tula 24-7 Weightless Moisture Day & Night Gel Cream to my face and neck, something instantly felt off. The texture was fine so I couldn't place what it was. A minute or so later it started - the slight face burning. Minutes passed and it got to the point I couldn't ignore it and had to wash my face yet again just to get it off! * I received this as a free sample and now I'm hooked. It works so great for my skin. It leaves it refreshed without being heavy. Other moisturizers can be too thick but this is thin and blends perfectly. Worth the purchase! * I started using this moisturizer about one month ago because Tula discontinued my favorite, Super Soothe. I call this a very happy accident, because now my skin is better than ever. Very soft, smooth and moisturized. I'm 64 years old with very sensitive skin - most everything breaks me out. But my skin just drinks this in. It's not sticky, and I don't think my skin has ever been so soft - with zero breakouts. I do always use the Clear It Up toner before I moisturize - I'm sure that helps. * My skin is oily but I still want a plumping hydrating effect as I'm in my late 30s. Most gel moisturizers are too lightweight for me, this one is neither too light or too heavy.  The lactic acid gives a gentle exfoliation so my skin looks more even. * I love the original 24/7 moisturizer but i wanted to try something lighter for under sunscreen in the summer. I felt that this would be the perfect solution. It is light weight, but it doesnt feel like it dries down on my skin and left me feeling very sticky all day. I have combination skin with some dry spots. This felt hydrating enough but I just cant get past how sticky it is, and the smell is a tad unpleasant. I will be sticking with the classic 24/7 moisturizer in the future. * Light, perfect moisturizer for morning & night with all the goodies. No need for extra facial oils. Plus, there are no harsh chemicals."

This might work great if you wear foundation daily or are under 30 with no texture, and yes this doesnt feel greasy or oily BUT it makes me look greasy and oily. I only spot conceal on most days and when I use this I have to put powder on my face because it makes me look so shiny, and the powder doesnt really stick in areas i dont have makeup on. For the price I really dont think i will keep it. * The cap bottom is concave so it doesn't want to sit upright on a flat surface in my bathroom. 
Please leave well enough alone. 
Stuff like this makes me want to abandon all your products if you are this careless with a little cap. * This moisturizer melts into the skin, do not sting the eyes and does not leave a white residual on the skin. This feels awesome on the face and neck. * I've gone through at least 4 bottles of this stuff this year and will continue to purchase it over and over again. 

It does not pill on me and i have never had an issue with the pump (I always get the larger size). Occasionally it will sting my eyes if I'm outside a lot in the summer, but i find that to be the case with most SPF. * Just as it says Water Drench. Moisture all day. Foundation glides over it"

Miss my moisturizer that was discontinued for what reason why??? * goes on heavy at first, but quickly turns lightweight as it soaks into and hydrates your skin. Only downfall is the price. * Amazing and so hydrating! * WHY DID THEY DISCONTINUE CHANEL HYDRA BEAUTY CREME RICHE? THEY REPLACED WITH WITH A CHEAPER VERSION THAT HAS GREASY LITTLE MICROBEADS IN IT? WHY WHY WHY? * I have tried MULTIPLE moisturizers in attempt to find a product that didn't break me out, cause my skin to sweat (too heavy/clog pores) and one that I could use under my Tom Ford Traceless Foundation and this IS IT 💯 Smells lovely and actually moisturizes my skin. I can't believe that I finally found a moisturizer!!"

It's very lightweight + smells good (even though it's not a scented product). The packaging isn't the most aesthetic but that doesn't stop it from being an amazing product! You can also get this product in their acne clearing kit, along with a foaming face wash and spot treatment. Love it! * Got this moisturizer as a wake me up for the cooling effect, but the amount of product doesnt even cross the verticle E in ""clear"" written on the front of the bottle. Highly disappointed because had i noticed before using it, I would have returned it. * As someone that's been struggling with finding a good moisturizer for my oily skin I am very impressed I struggle with oily skin so bad and it his moisturizer doesn't leave a shine and controls the oil :) * The only thing I really dislike is the scent I cannot figure out what it smells like (I've read the ingredients it's a lot of flowers) but I hate it. Other than the scent it's really helped my skin, I have oily/combo, it absorbs really fast, a tiny amount goes a long ways! * I just want to start by saying, I've never had a moisturizer that has ""wowed"" me before. This still isn't that, but it's the closet I've got. My initial response was, ""this is really silky!""—and it is! It is a bit tacky while drying, but nothing horrible. Now the scent is a bit on the strong side. I normally am okay with floral scents, but this one is a little too much. Nothing that would make me wash it off, but I don't prefer it. The reason it's great for my very oily, acne-prone skin is that it doesn't leave me with that gross, greasy effect I get after using most cream moisturizers. However, if you have dry, acne-prone skin, I do not recommend this gel moisturizer. (Check out Tatcha's 'The Dewy Skin Cream' moisturizer—that one works great for my skin when it gets dry in the winter.) I am greatly appreciative for this moisturizer this summer, hopefully it continues pairing well with my CeraVe products, so I can continue using it! * This is a wonderful light moisturizer. It doesn't make your skin feel oily or greasy, I noticeably don't have odors or residues that make me love this stuff, and more on this winter, gifted by dermalogica"

I would also add that it has a very oily finish, so if you have oily or combo skin, this likely isn't for you. * I've used this through a couple of bottles. My skin takes time to adjust to products (hence why the couple of bottles). 

I love that it is cruelty free and has vegan collagen. I love that it has SPF 30, a must for me, BUT it smells like sunscreen. It is definitely moisturizing, I don't have an issue with dry skin, BUT it's rather greasy. My daughter has even commented that my face is really greasy when I wear it (not really the vibe I'm going for). The chemicals burn my eyes as the day goes on. If I even wipe my eyes, it takes me minutes to wipe away whatever traces of this moisturizer is around my eyes. If I regularly wore makeup, this would be extra problematic. If you wear contacts, I do not recommend this. Imagine that burning getting caught up under your contacts.

I really, really wanted to love this because I didn't want to go through having my skin adjust to a new product, but I can't justify it based on it being a habit. * As mentioned by others, this would be more accurately described as ""SPF 30 sunscreen with collagen."" Smells exactly like a normal drugstore sunscreen. It's light and doesn't feel too greasy (but there is still a bit of that feeling). Overall it's ok * Just finished my bottle and ordered another one.  I have sensitive, adult cystic acne, 44 yr old skin that is in the normal to dry stage. This product:
1) has a sunscreen like feel to it when you first apply it, then it fades away
2) has a great glass bottle that you can get ALL of the product out of!
3) Spreads well- at little goes a long way- to much will make it sticky and it won't dry down fast
4) plays well with Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid serum and PUR love your selfie foundation. * I'm getting older, and my skin is changing, and I hate it. My old favorite daily moisturizer/SPF by No. 7 started making me breakout after years of no problems, so I had to search for something new. All the others I tried that claimed to not clog pores also happened to be too drying for my slightly oily but aging but still acne prone and also kinda dehydrated skin (ugh). But the moisture level of this Goldilocks cream is just right. If you have dry or slightly dry skin you will probably like it, if you are 40+ you will probably like it, if you're young and have oily skin you might NOT like it because it is not a light liquid, it's definitely a thick-ish cream. I can tell the fragrance they were trying for was *floral* but it leans more chemical, although it disappears in a minute or two. After application the skin feels moist, but not greasy. Makeup applies perfectly over it with no pilling at all. I somehow manage to not look shiny over the course of the day, which is practically miraculous. It doesn't seem to make me break out, as I've been using it for several weeks with no notable flares. I am relieved to have found my new favorite! * i like how this spf does not leave a white cast like other spfs. Plumped my skin right up and gave it a nice silky glow. * Love the fact its a moisturizer and has spf. Its easy to use and dont need as much since it spreads easily on your skin. I can feel it last for a good amount of time too"

It does nothing for my skin… super greasy, no firming, and makes my skin look worse. For the price I expected at least a decent product. In my opinion there are SO many great moisturizers out there that out perform this and are cheaper. * Bought this because I like the day cream version a lot.  This however was just not a great formulation for me.  It simply NEVER absorbs into my skin and then it just rubs off on my pillow case or hands eventually.   And I don't use an excessive amount because of the price tag.  I'm a big fan of using the minimal amount required.  It's too late to return it, so it's just going to move into my graveyard of products that I can't bare to throw away because, $$$, but just don't work on my skin.  Le sigh.  But, I still love the extra firming day cream and all my other Clarins products.  I would recommend trying a sample of this before buying if possible so you know if it's a good consistency for your skin. * Excellent result 👍 * Light weight, non greasy.  Plant enriched.  Vegan.  Long lasting.  Eco friendly packaging. * Really recommend this line for girls after 50. I feel my face firming after second week and continue improving. * This product is amazing!"

This did not irritate my skin, and honestly it has improved my acne. My skin has never looked better with Cosrx and i've been struggling with my skin since middle school. I am now 26. * This stuff is GOLD. I had never used retinol and read that a small percentage is the best way to start and wow.

You Can Visually & Physically Feel/Tell The Difference When Using This Product. I Like To Add Some Into A Spray Bottle & Then Remove Excess With A Cotton Pad. This Also Helped Me Years Back When I Was Having A Long Going Acne Breakout. I Have Not Had Any Problems With This Product & Will Continue Using. * I did not find this product to be soothing. Instead of reducing redness it seemed to make my skin more red. It left my skin feeling sticky instead of moisturized. My skin is a little sensitive, but i dont usually have to stop using products without finishing them. * I have mild rosacea. I am not consistent in my skincare routine, I will get some surface acne.   I implemented it into my current routine and used it consistently for 3 months. After about 6 weeks, I tried some variations to ensure that there wasn't interaction with what I was using. It did not exacerbate redness or irritate; however it also, did nothing else. The earthy smell dissipates as it dries. Nothing changed  I would not waste my money in the future on this particular product. * I have rosacea and this product helps to soothe redness and prevent further reactivity. It feels good on the skin and smells great. * Its so expensive, i wish it wasnt worth it. But it is! This makes my dry, sensitive skin so smooth and hydrated. 10/10. * I hope this product works for a lot of people. I have been searching for some thing that would help calm my angry skin. This has worked very nicely so far I've use this after I shaved my face, and it worked better than Proraso after shave.  I know everybody's skin is different so it may not work for you but coming from someone who has tried a lot of products. This is the one that has finally worked for me. I'm excited to try the moisturizer next."

Absolutely not worth the price point. There are more hydrating options out there. * I have dry, sensitive skin & this cream has been a game changer for my skin. I love that this balm doesn't have shea butter like most balms because i suffer from acne & cannot use that ingredient on skin. This cream has cleared my acne (i assume because it has salicylic acid) & my skin just looks & feels so much healthier. I love it so much, but like someone else said in the comments…I wish they made a bigger size because i go through this stuff so quick since i use it day & night. * I have extremely dry skin. It's very sensitve and reactive due to an autoimmune disease. I can use hardly anything on my face. I use and like the Kiehl's cica but thought this would be better with the colder temps now. It's not. Skin is dryer and I can tell my skin barrier is unhappy now. It reminds me of using body lotion on your face (which I've tried a few times) it leaves a chalky matte finish too. Not good for my middle aged skin. 
Their Cica cream is far superior and so is anything by Ursa Major for all you out there with unhappy dry skin. This doesnt cut it as a facial lotion. * This is vry healing on my dry skin. It gave me a couple of whiteheads on my face, but I noticed that it really calmed the redness. It's a trade-off. I would rather cover a pimple with a little makeup rather than cover up the redness all over my face. * It's fine. It didnt do much for my chronically dry skin. My face actually looked a little worse the next day. However, my neck and upper chest were improved after one use. It's now my neck/chest cream and i'll stick to an oil on my face. * I received this as a free gift with purchases of other products and fell in LOVE. I have super dry, sensitive, and itchy skin. Texture is also a big thing for me. I cannot do the oily and thick feel. I'm the same with body lotion, if it is too oily, or I can feel it on my face, ICK! This was perfect. Perfect coverage, light 'non-scented' smell was great. You know how some products advertise the non-scented and it smells awful?? Not this. I can't explain it. I am going to bite the bullet and purchase a full size; it looks kind of small for the price, but I am willing to pay if it helps me get some relief! * I have rosacea and very sensitive skin. Nothing has ever made my skin feel as calm and hydrated as this product. Not even prescription products from the dermatologist. The downside is that I have to apply THREE thick coats for my skin to not feel kinda tight. Its like my skin  just drinks this stuff up like crazy! I end up going through a tube in just less than a month, which is gonna get kinda pricy, but my skin is feeling better for it."

A LITTLE goes a long way! * The best face cream I have ever used. * This face cream was so expensive and I felt it didn't work for me.

Use it day 1 and your face feels like a babys butt the very next day. That's how fast and amazing this stuff works. Nothing will make your skins feel this soft and supple. And no breakouts! (a few moisturizers make me break out for some reason but not this) The only downside is the price; it's horrendously expensive so I hafta wait until my bday & xmas gift cards and rewards points to buy it so I only buy it about once a year. A little goes along way so I can make it last a few months. I'm 56 with normal to dry skin. * I have used it for a week now. Like the way my skin feels I use it at night.

I am not sure if it is the moisturizer or what but i have tried several different shampoos and conditioners and still have the problem. But i havent tried a different moisturizer yet. The smell does not bother me, it does smell good. I do feel like it isn't as moisturizing as it should be though… I really wish I could find the old Chanel Hydra Micro Creme! 

Honestly, I believe this moisturizer just depends on your skin type. I use it with my Chanel foundation.. I am still iffy about it because I feel like it also shows my ""fine lines"" more but I am not very good with all of this anyway.

Thank you Katarina…Chanel and Ulta are lucky to have such a professional, knowledgeable and kind associate! * I got this as a sample and I immediately bought it once it ran out. I live in the desert so my skin gets really dry with the weather here, this moisturizer has been the only thing that's been able to hydrate my skin without leaving it greasy and my pores look like they're getting smaller.

Put on after cleansing, serum, moisturizing, and spf. It makes a great primer before makeup, or you can use it for no makeup days as a beautiful finish that leaves bare skin glowing.

This took a few weeks to get used to, but I'm now using it almost every night. My skin has SO much more life to it! * I recently switched my skincare line from Lancôme to Kate Somerville and let me just say that my face hasn't looked or felt this good in years. I have seen more results in only a few short weeks than I ever did with Lancôme. AND this line is less expensive. It's a win win! * For the first two weeks, everything was fine. Last night, I put it on and it literally burnt the skin off around my eyes. I love the smell and feel of it, but I please be careful if you aren't used to using retinol. Avoid adding near your eyes or mouth * Texture-creamy yet light weight 
Smell- think of a orange creamsicle 
Skin type: dry and sensitive 
Provides a nice glow with the perfect amount of moisture. I apply this cream 2-3 times a night other nights I apply the ordinary rose hip oil * First, AMAZING smell! Like waffles & orange juice! 😁 I am 45 with normal to dry skin. I have not noticed any sensitivity after using. As soon as I put it on I can tell it's doing something. Feels like drinking a cold glass of water on a hot day. My skin drinks it up. After several weeks of using, my face is smoother, more evenly toned, and brighter. I REALLY like this product! * I am approaching forty and did not wear sunscreen daily when I was younger. This has dramatically improved my dark spots and smell amazing. I need one pump for my whole face. It is too harsh to use daily on my neck so it's definitely trial and error. I will be buying again! * So I tried this out for 4 days as recommended. Did fine until 4th day. My face is burning itching red and irritated. May be my skin type. But I have a waisted my money and I'm very upset."

I have been targeting some fine lines I've been getting around my mouth area and neck because I'm a year away from 30. I wish the SPF was a tad lower but I like that there's SPF in it. It's a good product to have and I'm glad I was gifted by dermalogica. * Gifted by Estée Lauder , Loved the product, it was lightweight and perfect for my night time routine. It worked perfect on my sensitive skin, I will continue to incorporate it into my everyday routine. It was not overly fragranced and blended nicely. * I try to find products that already have SPF included so having this available in travel size is not just convenient, but also a great product. It's moisturizing without being heavy so it's great for daytime wear. Its great as a base before applying foundation.  Gifted by dermoligica. * Dermalogica's Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF 50 has become my go-to daily moisturizer. From the first application, I loved how it felt on my skin—lightweight yet deeply hydrating. It blends seamlessly and leaves my skin feeling firm and smooth, making it a perfect base for makeup. I've also noticed a brighter complexion and improved elasticity over time. Plus, the broad-spectrum SPF 50 gives me peace of mind knowing my skin is well-protected. * This moisturizer is very hydrating and perfect for someone like me who often forgets to apply sunscreen 
before leaving home. Its milky, lightweight texture absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't leave any white cast. It's perfect for layering under makeup without feeling greasy or heavy. The dual-action formula hydrates the skin while providing sun protection from uv rays. Gifted by Dermalogica! * Very hydrating with not a strong scent. The travel size is perfect for tossing in a daily bag, and reapplying when the spf has worn off or washed off. My skin didn't get burned in the sun, so the spf50 seems to work well! Something I will definitely repurchase. Gifted by detmalogica * I think this has become my new favorite moisturizer. I always like to have spf in a moisturizer and I love that this one is 50 spf. It's creamy and very hydrating and wow the glow that you get after applying it is beautiful! Gifted by dermalogica"

I got a little sunburn and used this and the burn went away over night with no peeling. I will forever use this as my after sun lotion. Highly recommend. * After using this product once I woke up the next morning with severe redness and achne-like bumps over my entire face!! I wanted to itch my face off it was so bad. Once I removed the product my face started to calm down. My skin is never sensitive like this, but it did NOT like this product what-so-ever!! * I wouldn't say that I am a fan of any skincare product, I hope they just do their job. Nothing has floored me like this skincare line. I bought this moisturizer because I bought the eye cream a couple weeks ago and LOVED IT. I can actually feel these products working on my skin. I've been blessed with normal skin and I can actually feel the benefits of this product. I feel moisturized and my skin feels ""alive"". I would highly recommend. * Big fan of Ole Henriksen products. I've tried them all and while its hard to choose a favorite, this is my go-to. It smells great (like a fresh orange) and feels even better. My skin just looks younger and better."

This lotion promises a lot—gentle exfoliation, brightening effects, and hydration—all while being safe for sensitive and acne-prone skin. 

By the end of the week, my skin looked more even-toned, and some of my dark spots had started to fade. The gentle exfoliation from the lactic acid helped in renewing my skin without causing any irritation or redness—a common issue I face with more aggressive exfoliants. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid exceeded my expectations! This dynamic blend of lactic acid and vitamin C not only brightens my complexion but also gently exfoliates. My skin feels smoother and looks more radiant. Its lightweight, non-greasy formula makes it ideal for use under makeup. This lotion has swiftly become one of my top choices for achieving a glowing, healthy appearance. * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C is perfect for my normal to dry skin. It also brightens and evens out my skin. I love to apply it when my legs are out for a natural glow! * Looking for bright and radiant skin? Look no further! The lightweight moisturizing lotion contains 7% lactic acid for gentle exfoliation and Vitamin C for skin that will look glowy and fresh! My skin looks smoother and softer after just a few days! * The AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid is a staple especially for the Summer. I'm always on the hunt for some sort of vitamin c lotion. Since we have hard water that can be so tedious. Not only does it help repair my skin but I also get to brighten my skin at the same time. * I'm a big fan of the AmLactin Daily Vitamin C Lotion with 7% Lactic Acid AHA! This product truly brings out the radiance in my skin with its brightening formula that gives me a nice glow. I already own a few AmLactin products, but this one stands out to me because of its amazing scent – a lovely hint of cocoa that I adore. I believe this ingredient plays a part in maintaining the health and glow of my skin. I've noticed that the Vitamin C in this lotion is really working on evening out my skin tone and keeping it super smooth! * This product has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine, especially because my skin needs extra moisture when I'm constantly in the sun in the summer. I love that this product absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue! Highly recommend"

I had to wash it off. Returned it to the store. This one is not for me but Olay doesn't make it easy to know which one of their products to use. * I purchased this moisturizer from Ulta and it arrived within a few days. I use the product both morning and evening even if I am supposed to only use it once a day. My skin appears brighter and it is definitely smoother. I even use it on my neck but so far I haven't noticed a difference there. * This smooths my face and doesn't cause breakouts which so many moisturizers do. I haven't found a moisturizer yet that doesn't break me out. It lasts all day and works well underneath your makeup or by itself. I definitely plan on continuing to use this. * A couple months back I went on vacation to the Bahamas where my skin ended up breaking out very badly.  I brought this moisturizer with. It felt like my face was burning off and every time I took a shower more skin peeled off my face. It was the most miserable time ever. I assumed it had something to do with the trip. A couple days ago I tried this product again, the next morning the same thing happened, immediately this time. My face is burning, feels hot to the touch, bright red and is breaking out with little bumps all over and starting to do that gross oozy thing again. Now I realize it's this moisturizer. It might be awesome on some, just not me. I really wanted to like this product but I wouldn't wish this horrible reaction on anybody. So I guess just be cautious and if you notice something doesn't feel right, stop using it immediately. * This stuff isnt just great for your face, but can work on other sensitive areas too. I had dark marks/hyperpigmentation left behind from a medical adhesive left on my thigh too long, and this genuinely helped to fade those lines to a point where they are less noticeable * I love the way this smells. I use it in the mornings, a little hint of citrus smell is nice to give you a little wake up. Goes on a little sticky, but drys smooth and soft. Definitely recommend. * I've been a licensed esthetician for over 5 years and also an Ulta employee. I got this as a gift for the holidays and had no interest in trying it. I'm such a skincare snob. Well, I tried it. I absolutely love this moisturizer. I get so many compliments on my skin when I wear it because I'm glowing."

I will definitely buy it again!! * I have acne rosacea along with endometriosis, so my skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and breakouts so easily. I have tried every moisturizer from the drugstore to my dermatologist prescriptions, and nothing, I mean nothing has compared to this. this has not made my face itch, burn, or breakout. it actually took away about 90% of my redness in the first 24 hours i used it. i never thought Chanel would be my life line, but its now my holy grail. if you are truly sensitive, and not just ""sensitive"" like the majority of women say and they use like Cerave on their skin, but seriously have sensitive skin, try this out. you wont be disappointed. id rather pay more for quality ingredients than anything from a drugstore. * I have been a hardcore Charlotte Tillbury Magic Cream fan. I started using tretonin so it was suggested I use this moisturizer before and after applying the tretonin. I absolutely love it. It's extremely moisturizing and smells amazing. My face is very dry but after using this it feel so soft and smooth. It's kind of small for the price but I love it so much I will suck it up. * I wanted to love this item but I used it once and the second day, the pump stopped working.   I tried to pump many times but no product was coming out.   It was definitely a splurge but for the price it's not worth it.   Maybe change the packaging??? * I love the results of this product but I'm allergic to the fragrance. I was sneezing, runny nose, etc. Why does everyone who make such lovely lotions have to ruin it with fragrances? * My skin looks so healthy radiant and feels soft to the touch!"

It looks great under makeup, you wake up as if you had just washed your face, I love it! Super moisturizing. * I am of the darker persuasion in her late 30s and it is hard to find a moisturizer that does not over power you with the smell. But this, this one is lovely. It goes on like butter ladies. Trust me it blends well with other products too. * This cream smells like the airplane cabin bathroom pink hand soap, which is slightly offputting. It also feels thick and heavy without seeming to sufficiently moisturize my face, so I think this formula just isn't for me."

It feels way too oily on my skin and uncomfortable. I like the concept, but I feel it'll be more suitable for dry skin since it leaves a glow and deeply hydrates. Or for winter time. * I know this has peptides in it, but honestly it just feels like a great, moisturizing, basic sunscreen. It does leave you glowy.

The product makes my face feeling refreshed and so soft. I highly recommend this product. * I never have acne except when i get my period but i bought this and started having acne. * I swear I've tried so many different moisturizers and my skin is kind of combination, this leaves my sling soft but not oily! * I have combination skin and I'm 58...this works great.

Will buy again. * Because of my new facial eczema, my skin barrier was in need of help. I tried multiple products that left my skin feel and greasy and heavy, But this product was a lifesaver.  It's lightweight but very hydrating.  I can't wait to try the daytime, cream and face wash * I've used this product for 2 months now and haven't noticed ant differences in my skin. I was looking forward to the green tea and ceramides ingredients in it. The texture of the moisturizer is fine. Not super thick and not too thin. I have oily skin and it doesn't make me breakout or anything. Just not seeing the results I anticipated. I'd rather use the Olay's regenerist lines or Peach & Lily's matcha pudding over this where I can really see a daily difference * Usually healing my skin barrier means putting up with a week+ of slathering my face with a thick moisturizer or balm. As someone with sensory processing issues, I hateee feeling residue from those products on my skin, especially when going to sleep (iykyk)

But OMG this product is a PERFECT balance of hydrating and lightweight. It feels like my skin drinks it in and by the time I'm ready for bed there is hardly any residue! At first I worried maybe this meant it was too lightweight to a truly heal my barrier, but after a few weeks I can attest that it really does work.
The only downside is the packaging (they don't stand up) but tbh the formulation is so good, i'm still giving 5 stars. I also recommend the AM moisturizer, but idk how effective it is as SPF. Def get the night time though! * I purchased this because of the ingredients and the reviews. The product is titled ""Barrier Renew."" One of the active ingredients is oleic acid: ""Free fatty acids (FFAs), specifically monounsaturated FFAs such as oleic acid, may disrupt skin barrier and act as permeability enhancers for other compounds present in plant oils"" [36].Dec 27, 2017. That is what I found about oleic acid. I look like I sat on the sun without protection.  Disappointed and will be returning. * my skin feels absolutely amazing since using this at night. within minutes your skin feels soft, calm, supple. and the next morning I have a beautiful glow. I'm obsessed! * I had been struggling with skin that felt uncomfortably dry by the end if the day. I am glad I tried this! It is a cool, thick hydrating gel with slip that dries down to something almost imperceptible on the skin. Because it didnt leave my face shiny and greasy, I didn't expect it to work to prevent dryness- but it did! I layer it over my RX at night and under my SPF in the morning with no pilling issues. I also really like that it doesnt add MORE shinyness to my skin when laying under an already dewy SPF (another brand).  My skin doesnt look glazed or juicy with this- it just looks like normal, not dehydrated, healthy skin and thats cool with me!"

I was blown away by how effective this max hydration cream by ROC is! When you first apply this you can feel it deeply hydrating your skin. It's fast absorbing and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. After about a week of use i started to notice a slight reduction of my visible fine lines and wrinkles. After about 3 weeks to a month of use I have much firmer skin. This cream is amazing! 
Contains Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol for maximum results. Dermatologist tested. Paraben free. Non comedogenic. Non irritating and fragrance free. 
I received this product free from Roc & PinchMe. * So gar I'm enjoying the  line smoothing max hydration cream. It's a bit thicker than I anticipated but it's creamy enough the it goes on smooth. After just a few days I noticed how hydrated my skin feels. I can't wait to see what the future holds in continuing this product.  Because I sure need it. Retinol these lines honey.. retinol these lines lol. Thanks ulta * ١like the effectiveness, moisturizing, and skin softness of the product. They mention it works well, leaves their faces feeling hydrated, and is the absolute best moisturizer they have ever tried. Some appreciate wrinkle reduction and the skin look. However,I have reported that the product can irritate sensitive skin and burn their eyes. Opinions are mixed on the scent and value for money. * Love the feel of my skin after putting this on. It's feel so soft. * I have not used this cream for very long, but so far I like it. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I have just started using the RoC products. So far I have been very pleased. My skin is already looking better. I'm hoping that in time I will see a significant improvement in my skin. * Cream is a very good moisturizer.

I would recommend! * I just bought this came home put it on and instantly got a headache from the strong perfume smell. It's like they dumped a whole bottle of floral old lady perfume in this moisturizer. I looked at the ingredients and it actually says perfume and that shouldn't be in a face moisturizer.

Nit a fan. * The moisturizer itself works well. I like the feel of my skin while wearing it. I gave it a week but I can't wear it any more. The scent is so strong and just to much for a facial moisturizer. It smells like the sunflower perfume my Mom wore in the 90's. So to me, it just smells very dated and old. haha I gave it away. * I love this day cream!!  My face is prone to hormonal breakouts, and since using this product my skin has definitely calmed down.  I don't even wear foundation anymore (unless its an event or something), I just put this on, then put on some concealer and bronzer and I'm good to go for the day!

Great for milia!! Mine is starting to go away. * I sampled this in the store and it smelled wonderful and moisturized with being too heavy so it was perfect for my oily skin. Unfortunately, my skin reacted and I was left with a pimple and a rash on my face. * I used to use clinique and it would leave my face very dry as soon as i used FRESH it left my face moisturized the same day! I love it !! * While I wanted to love this Fresh product, I can barely say I like it. I have oily/combo skin but I feel like this product leaves me face really oily after application.

Do not use for outdoor activities. It will burn your eyes SO badly. I don't have sensitive eyes or skin but I was practically blind on a summer hike. Horrible! I expect more from a brand like this. * I do have to say I only just tried this product so I'm unsure if it will break me out in the future. However it feels lovely on my skin. Before I applied this product I had some slight dry patches on my skin and it noticeably reduced the dryness. It didn't leave any white cast on my skin (I do have very fair skin though) and it made my skin looks very dewy and glowing! I would definitely recommend this product :) * I really do not understand the bad reviews. This is a great moisturizer with SPF in it. I personally like an all in one product and with 4.2 ounces you get a good value for your money. Not only does this have great ingredients, it is hydrating, sinks into your skin very easily, doesn't leave a white cast, and does not make your eyes burn. My skin glows after applying and it also wears SO well under makeup!! I do not find this sunscreen to be greasy at all. It actually makes me less oily throughout the day compared to the other SPF moisturizer I was using previously. I was using the Cerave AM lotion but wasn't in love with it as it took a lot of TLC to blend in and made my makeup pill. I was recommended this product by a friend and I am so glad I bought this. For those concerned about fragrance I notice a very very slight sunscreen smell but it doesn't bother me and I am someone who is sensitive to scents. This is a chemical sunscreen so some people may be sensitive to that. I am someone who isn't. I prefer chemical sunscreens anyway because they usually do not leave a white cast and are more hydrating. Mineral sunscreens are always too drying for my skin and leave too much of a whitecast. * I love this moisturizer. A little goes a long way. I just love how it applies and how moisturized my skin feels afterwards. * It's ok. Def more of a sunscreen feel. Doesn't leave a white cast but takes a while to soak in. I have to wait quite awhile before I can begin applying my makeup. Like a lot of Kiehl's products but won't buy this one again. * I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now and I swear by it. I put it on in the morning before applying my makeup and it works perfectly. I've found that some moisturizers make my foundation look kinda wonky, but my makeup goes on top of this one nicely. Also, I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with this product. I'm never going back!"

My skin type is dry but acne prone fyi. This moisturizer can be used for the face and body and my skin does not feel dry or tight, Simply moisturized. * I use to moisturize my face in the morning and night. I definitely recommend! * So im new to skincare. I was having a bad breakout. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin. Ever ""sensitive skin moisturizer"" straight up burns my face. This moisturizer has never hurt my face. I use this as my night time moisturizer. In only a week i have seen great changes to my face. It feels super smooth. And dont quote me on this, but i BELIEVE this product has niacinamide in it. The niacinamide cleared my redness. I highly reccomend if you are stumped on a moisturizer for sensitive skin. * My skin is dry and that makes it quite sensitive. But this lotion and shower gel does not irritate my skin and certainly helps it feel better. * I love this i have dry skin especially in the fall and winter definitely recommend * This is one of the only lotions that does not break out my mega sensitive acne prone skin, but the niacinimide in this stings, itches, and burns for about an hour after i apply.  I wish cetaphil made a lotion without niacinimide and hyaluronic acid, as they both sting and itch on people who have mega sensitive skin.   Until they make one, this will have to do. * This is a good skin moisturizer for all skin types."

It is already half way gone with only using it a half full of times because the lid does not lock and stay in place! Highly disappointed. * I need C10 now! * Vitamin C does wonders for your skin. I use this for daytime care in conjunction with the Redermic R in the evening. It's a great combo ! * I use Redermic C every morning as my moisturizer.  I put it on, let it stay on a few minutes to absorb, and then apply my foundation and other makeup. * I use for 1 year and my skin now looks better, my Dermatologist recommended it 👌🏼 * I used to use Dr Perricone products which are great but pricey so I read about the LaRoche line and some have gotten rewards from New Beauty Magazine. I gave it a try and I am very happy with the results ! I use Redermic R every other night and the Redermic C everyday in the morning. My skin looks and feels the same as when I used Perricone products. It consistently delivers. * Try it."

The idea that it helps to brighten the skin without Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) won me over. I find Vitamin C can be too aggressive on my skin. * I love this moisturizer! Its my favorite to use day in and day out. It has an extremely soft, lightweight texture so its great for daily, but also has so many brightening, moisturizing, and mild resurfacing properties, its also great for my evening regimen as well. Ive noticed a lot of my dark spots evening out, and my skins surface looking more ""glass"" like. The Vitamin C & Beautyberry in this work together so well to be brightening & moisturizing. This is definitely one of my HOLY GRAILS!! * I seen a significant difference in my dark spots with this product! * This cream is amazing! It even tone my skin and took care of the dark spots. I've been it regularly, and I love the feeling of smooth and find lines! * Love how my skin looks more even * I do not have sensitive skin and this product made me break out. I'm 56 and never had acne issues. I do not recommend this"

But the smell, from natural herbal ingredients, disappears after a few minutes. Dimethicone (silicone) makes this cream feel luxurious, soft, and smooth. * Got this on sale half off, figured id try it out since ive heard great things about this brand.  Im glad i did.  
It does have a fragrance but the fragrance reminds me of refreshing lemon very slightly.  Absorbs pretty well, and leaves me glowing.  I have sensitive skin thats normal-oily, acne prone, and alot of redness.  This did not bother my skin at all.  I love it. * I have eczema flare ups here and there & also have combo (mostly oily skin). The smell isnt too over bearing which I love. It has not broken me out. I love the moisture bomb and have recently bought a separate vitamin C (not belif)… but ngl i forget to use it here and there… this makes me 100x more accountable on getting that vitamin c in my routine! Overall love it! Belif products never miss for me * I really love this product! Ive been using the aqua bomb for so long at night, its nice to have the vitamin c in the morning! I feel like my acne scars have diminished, my face is moisturized, and my skin is overall in better condtion. I usually have difficulty finding new skin products as i have sensetive skin, but this is defintely a new staple for my skin routine! * Left a greasy film on my face that would not absorb"

I've tried it a number of times and every time it pills up. it flakes off my face and makes it impossible to do makeup on top because it flakes off so much. do not buy! * Although it does provide oil control and has little to no white cast, it's very thick and isn't ""lightweight "". Very thick and makes it hard to distrubuted across the face without roughly dragging it on your face. * Its not light weight and it feels like a sunscreen and not a moisturizer. Its really heavy and leaves a cast. IMO its not melanin friendly i had to wash it off in order to not walk around looking like a ghost. * Not a ""lightweight daily moisturizer"" at all. More like a thick sunscreen. Didnt have any bad reactions with it but it was difficult to rub in consistently and dried really quick. Does help with oil control though. Probably wont repurchase. * I love it. I use as primer and spf. the less product under my makeup the better. set with powder. * This moisturizer feels more like a sunscreen. It is very thick and heavy, difficult to spread around the face. I wanted to try something new and this isn't it. My have oily skin but I am not sensitive to products at all - this made me extremely itchy in the face. Never using again! * It goes on very dry and peels off. Feels very uncomfortable on face and smells bad."
