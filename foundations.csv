Is Perfect for All skin types, especially if You have Any kind of Oil, T-Zone etc. Blends in So Smooth.  Love Love 🩷 * I Absolutely LOVE this foundation! Its looks Beautiful on the skin....Very Natural. Is Perfect for All skin types, especially if You have Any kind of Oil, T-Zone etc. Blends in So Smooth.  Love Love 🩷 * Honestly, I get oily in the T zone area and ived tried so many foundations…they always have me dabbing my oily face after the first hour, but this foundation is my holy grail ! I see less oily face especially after a concert my foundation still looks amazing! I recommend!! * I'm 33 and it doesn't look good on my skin. I have dry sensitive skin and this showed dry patches. I've tried so many different primers (water, silicone) and moisturizers but nothing looked good with it. I'm giving it two stars because it does stay on your face for awhile but just didn't sit right on my skin. Really sad because the all nighter was my favorite foundation * I love this foundation and am on my 3rd bottle of it. I have oily skin that eats through foundation. I've tried Fenty, Estee Lauder, Milani, etc. This foundation holds up 10x better than any of those after a full day.

 I will say I do use setting powder and spray despite it being ""self setting"" because my skin is just that oily. But I've used the same routine with other foundations and had horrible results so I know it's the Urban Decay foundation that's doing most of the work.

I also have rosacea and this does a good job covering it up without making it look like I'm wearing a mask. It has a really smooth finish & doesn't feel heavy at all. 

I also love the bottle design and the fact that I can get every drop out when it's running low. I hope they continue to make this for a long time. * I have been struggling to find a good foundation that was full coverage, but did not feel like you were literally wearing a mask!! This has been such a gamechanger!! I apply with a brush, and it stays on all day, and still looks great at the end of the day! * This is the best foundation that money can buy. Got this during their 50% off foundation sale thanks to the TikTok girlies. I'm excited to use this for the summer."

3,dior,dior forever fluid skin glow foundation,pimprod2036824,2605019," * Inloce a foubdation that guves a natural finish (not too matte, not shiny) and a bit of a ""radiant"" look with lightvreflecting sheen (but not some ghastly psychedelic prism effect). 

Based in thecdescriotion, inhooed this fitvthe above. It dies not. It keaves a shiny finish that is a bit ""sticky"" to the touch. I dud not care for it. I have nornal skin, perhaps occasionally (winter) on the dry side. * I have tried working with this product in sooo many ways and no matter what it becomes textural, dry, and patchy. Its just plain ugly. Ive never experienced anything like it. I also never leave reviews but after many months of trial and disappointment, I felt compelled to tell you to save your money. Love Dior generally good grief * A makeup artist applied this shade and it looked identical to my Cool tone pale skin. I was given a sample and used it at home. The color faded and turned out whiter than my skin tone. Half of my face was white and the other side was my natural pale skin with rosacea. Applied to entire face and I see streaks on my cheeks and it doesn't set well with Setting spray. I wanted to love this but its not giving me a natural dewy finish or the same color match. Too white! * This is actually the worst foundation I've ever used. I don't understand any positive reviews?? Cakey, oxidized, and hard to wash off. My skin looked more even and glowy before I put this junk on. Dior should stick to making handbags. * Best foundation ever. * The foundation goes on smoothly it gives a natural finish but gets so freaking blotchy and basically disappears when wearing after an hour or two not worth the price * I love the foundation looks flawy but after 5 hours i get patchy spots in my face. My face is not oily is more dry i use a hydrating moisturizer but not working for me"

5,lancÃ´me,teint idole ultra wear 24h full coverage foundation,pimprod2039028,2608119," * I received this product in exchange for my honest Review this is amazing however I was sent the darkest shade and I am as pale as can be however I did wear test my arm for review. The coverage is perfect and fill.the finish is supple and beautiful.ot didn't have a strong scent at all which I appreciate. The packaging is nice and quality.and the shade range is great. * This has been the only foundation ive used for over a year now. Is long lasting and covers blenishes well. Woukd recommend to everyone!! * Excellent base in terms of its coverage and texture, it does not leave marks or part, I actually loved it and it lasts the whole day. The tone was a little dark, but I'm still enjoying it a lot. It's easy to work with and blend. * Since they reformulated, I can't find  my shade.  
I had to start using Haus Labs foundation and I found my perfect match there. The employee went through about 5-6 shades and we couldnt find a match. So sad because I used this foundation for 10 years and it was my #1. I would get so many compliments on my make up too. I wish they brought back the old formula. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This is truly a great foundation! One of the standout features for me is how weightless it feels on the skin, it's like wearing nothing, but with great medium to full build able coverage. The semi-matte finish is beautiful and looks so natural and smooth. 

I have oily skin so I wore it with the Hourglass Veil primer and was impressed with how well it held up throughout the day. Even when my natural oils started to come through in the evening, it didn't look greasy at all. Instead, it gave my skin a subtle dewy glow that looked fresh rather than shiny.

The only downside I noticed is with the shade range or the accuracy of the shades. When I first received it, I thought the color would be way too dark 345N , but it turned out to be a perfect summer match. Typically I would have picked a color in the 200N range considering I fall in the light skin tone range. To be honest, even for a summer shade I would have never gotten 345N which is for medium skin tone, assuming it would be far too dark. Usually for my summer shade I get a light medium shade. If I had picked it out myself based on what I usually go for, I probably would've ended up with something way too light. So definitely try it in person if you can. All in all, I absolutely love this foundation and will be purchasing it myself once I finish this bottle. * Found the perfect warm tone shade! Very easy to blend and very buildable! Super hydrating not too heavy, would highly recommend as a go to natural look foundation. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This was a surprisingly lovely foundation. I loved the finish on my skin. I would describe it as a medium coverage foundation. I liked that the packaging allowed me to do partial pumps so that I could build up to my desired coverage. I didn't really notice any scent to this product at all."

The coverage is good but I think I'd prefer something a little more thicker. * The product is thin and goes on easy. My face looks natural but also covers any facial problems. My face looks illuminated. I love it. * I did not like this foundation. It didn't look matte or light-reflecting at all. It looked like drugstore makeup that was applied poorly and sat as a second layer on my face. I would not buy this again and especially not at its price point. * To watery.

9,mac,studio fix fluid spf15 24hr matte foundation + oil control,pimprod2044825,2622206," * This product gives full coverage and goes along way with a little use * The new formula is completely useless and not worth the price tag! It separates all over leaving greasy, cakey clumps and if you attempt to touch up to fix it, it comes off! I gave it 3 tries and it was awful every time. I am moving on to a different brand. * Let me begin by saying, im a LOYAL mac foundation girly of 10 years. Its heartbreaking to find out they discontinued the previous formula and replaced it w this garbage…. PLS bring back the original formula!! * Let me begin by saying, im a LOYAL mac foundation girly of 10 years. Its heartbreaking to find out they discontinued the previous formula and replaced it w this garbage…. PLS bring back the original formula!! * Not best quality for the money. * The new formula is so SO bad. Doesn't blend well, is completely different than the other one. Looks like drug store makeup at an expensive price tag! They RUINED this foundation. Read the reviews and tried to give it a chance. It looks horrible! Don't waste your money. Please bring the old formula back!! * First of all, the shades changed and my usual shade was no longer matching so I had to get rematched and could not find a good match. I finally purchased one that was ""close enough"". When I got around to wearing it for a night out, it was terrible!! It dries super fast at application, but I was able to adjust, not a big deal. The coverage is very light now, I had to build up to get decent coverage and I assumed it would look great as I stepped out the door. Big fail!! I checked my makeup an hour later and was shocked at how bad it looked! My skin looked dry and chalky, it had settled into all my pores and fine lines and was starting to separate! I touched up as best as I could and checked again after about another hour…it looked worse! It had settled on every pore, fine line, it was cakey around my nose, mouth, it was separating into ""clumps"" all over my face and my skin looked unbelievably greasy! I tried to touch up again but it just came off on my fingers and powder brush! It was so frustrating and embarrassing dealing with this absolutely horrible foundation on my face while I was at an event. If you want to try it for yourself, I suggest you don't wear it for anything important! Better yet, I suggest you don't waste your time, energy or money on this totally useless and terrible foundation."

I couldn't remember the foundation number for Fenty makeup. He was awesome and patient with all my questions! * I love how flawless it makes my skin look!! Very nice formula! * You have to really try and get the correct shade match because I was originally matched with 310 and that was too light. Then I tried the 315, and the 320, both did not look bad, but there was something off about the colors. I tried mixing the 310 with the 315 before the 320 came out and it was just an okay color on me. I didn't  love it, and then finally I watched someone on YouTube with my skin complexion using 335 and this was the perfect match! I did try the 330 and it was too warm on my skin. Now I look fabulous and it is good for the summer also does not transfer as I work with lot of paperwork. Fenty loose powder is Lovely too! * I have severe melasma that I try covering up.This is a great full coverage. This product doesn't budge in the humid months. However, the packaging isn't great. After the 5th or so use, it always leaks. Wish they made a travel friendly bottle. * I was really skeptical about orsering the product online because in the picture the color i was matched with from the camera option looked super dark. I did valid slreasearch about the color and placed the order. It arrived very quickly packaged to a T and arrived very quickly. It isnt anywhere near as dark as it looked in the online photos and surprisingly matched my skin tone pretty well. Overall great experience and once i try the makeup out on my face and see how it is this could potentially be a repurchase:)!! My only say is be careful the shade you order online because if you are looking for darker the pictures on ulta arent acurate . Thats all * My holy grail foundation is the Charlotte Tilbury Flawless foundation but it was sold out everywhere so i did some research and decided to buy this foundation. Im absolutely in love with it and so glad I purchased it, it feels like im not wearing any foundation"

14,it cosmetics,cc+ nude glow lightweight foundation + glow serum with spf 40,pimprod2031824,2594106," * Purchased Fair Light, advertised as ""cool rosy"", which is actually a WARM peach. The shade is extremely warm and completely wrong for my cool skin. In under 30 minutes, the shade oxidized to an orange that is way too dark. The finish is amazingly skin-like - no creasing/caking, glides over dry patches and leaves skin with a natural glow. Will be returning for the next lighter shade in a cool range. Really hoping that it is genuinely cool, not a warm peach. * Very glowy. Great coverage. * My skin glows and looks so healthy. I'm usually skeptical about cc cream coverage, but this is exceeds my expectations. It evens out the redness on my face. * I love this lightweight foundation. It feels like I'm not wearing any. Perfect color match and it last me for at least 4 months. * I was at Ulta the other day and the It team was there. They tried some on me and it was determined that I could use either the Medium or Light. I purchased the medium and it looked really great on my skin but I'm a bit more pale currently. I know this will look great when I'm a bit tan so I kept it and went back and purchased the light. 
Ive been using the light and mixing just a bit of the medium in and its so perfect. I never really wore cc cream before this and I tell you , I really look more polished. Put together. I am grateful to have taken a chance and tried these. The MAs at my local Ulta were just so helpful! They really nailed my color. 
The coworkers are giving me compliments too! :) * I had gotten away from wearing foundation after I retired. Covid only reinforced that trend. But I felt I needed to try a new plan with an upcoming birthday. So I went to Ulta and spoke to one of the make up experts. She steered me to this product. She was correct.  It is the right color for my face, and it had what I asked for..
some glow to my aging skin. I love the way it looks. Even my husband noticed the difference. So it a big 🩷 * I'm much happier with the lighter coverage this time.  I also needed a better color and the sales associate helped me pick one."

It wears wonderfully and is my new go to * This is the same thing as the estee lauder double wear foundation. You cannot convince me otherwide. They are the exact same formula, only the hydra resue has spf. It is not moisturing at all. Dry skin is not going to work well with this. If you want a super matte finish, extremely full coverage foundation that you can wear for 14 days and it not come off, you might like this. If you like the double wear, this is identical. * Too runny for me * Liked the foundation but beauty consultant was of no help whatsoever.  Had to return foundation because color was so off.  It gave me a chalky, pasty look. Almost ghost like.  Went to Von Muer and the consultant gave me a perfect match. * I love this foundation.  It has SPF 50, and is easy to apply.  It looks natural and stays very well. * Love this...Doesn't set up in my fine lines like most"

17,pur,4-in-1 love your selfie longwear foundation & concealer,pimprod2005671,2544533," * The coverage is beautiful for this over 70 skin, pores literally disappear even on my chin. I live in the south so sometimes the consistency is a little too thick for humidity but such an easy fix. Add a little moisturizer to the back of your hand and mix. Label says acts as concealer also. Absolutely, just a dab with the applicator and Pur perfection. * Love the coverage, couldn't tell if any was on * I'm over 40 and i absolutely love it highly recommend * I really wanted to love this product as much as I loved the clean ingredients. Unfortunately, it added a lot of texture around acne spots. I think also the shade wasn't my exact match but it's really limited in store and didn't want to wait again to not be satisfied so I ended up returning it. * This is the best foundation i have ever tried!!Been using for years!! Every so often i make the mistake of trying something new and always go back, nothing compares. This went on sale about a week ago bought a few to stock up but then i started overthinking and worrying about  why it was on sale, ""was it because were going to discontinue?!"" .. Any whoooo I really never ever write reviews but im just here to say, please dont ever discontinue! * I'm really picky about foundation and it took me years to find one that works for me. I used to be a matte girl because of my super oily skin but as I've gotten older i have too many lines and crepes for that to look good anymore. Couple that with the fact that everything makes me break out and it's impossible to find a good match until this! This strikes the balance between dewy and matte so I have a youthful glow without looking like a grease slick. It lasts well if I set it with powder and I love that it works as concealer too. The dual purpose applicator is great. The fact that it goes by undertone makes the color match the best i have found. I haven't had issues with breakouts either! Perfection! * It moves and settles into the creases around my eyes and shows every pore. I hate it."

I have a very red nose because of having radiation to clear up basil cell carcinoma on my nose. It completely covers this redness and roseca on my face. Try it! * I typically use the natural finish formula of this product but wanted to switch things up for the warmer months when my skin is a little more shiny and oily. The matte version feels and works great. Just as I expected it would. However, the sunscreen scent is so much stronger! It's a bit overwhelming. Maybe I won't notice it as much in time, but my inital reaction is that they need to find a way to tone that down that scent. It's definitely not that strong in the other formulations. * I wanted to love this product because i heard so many good things and its also skincare but after using it for 2 months ive decided its not worth the hype. It oxidizes and peels throughout the day no matter what i try to use in conjunction with it * This is super patchy on m skin. I bought this as a ""backup"" in November for when my I was gonna run out of the glow formula (which I love). I was so excited to finally try it/start a new foundation and it is a complete fail. I am already out of the return windows but I will never purchase this one again. * I picked up the matte version of this after really loving the illuminating one. I was hoping for something a bit more natural-looking for everyday wear—just a little less glow. Unfortunately, this one didn't work out for me. It's supposed to help with pores, but it actually made them way more noticeable on my skin—it looked like I had little polka dots all over my face. It also settled into fine lines and didn't blend in very well. Kind of a letdown, especially since the illuminating version blended so nicely and gave such great coverage. * I have oily skin and maybe this is not meant for my type of skin, but it did not work for me.
It did not remain matte and by mid-day the foundation looked thin and patchy. * I think this looks great! I applied with a damp sponge and it did not look cakey at all. So easy to apply and looks beautiful."

Also, it was able to hid some blemishes that with other products I have to apply extra over typically for full coverage. No scent, goes on smooth and evenly. Matched skin tone well. * This made me break out bad.  Doesn't control oil at all. I will be returning it.  Probably good for conbo to dry skin. * Fenty Beauty Foundation is a game-changer in the world of makeup. It's incredibly lightweight, making it feel like you're barely wearing anything at all, which is perfect for daily wear. The formula blends seamlessly into the skin, providing a smooth, natural finish that doesn't feel heavy or cakey. However, it's important to note that this foundation doesn't layer well on top of itself, so adding extra coverage in certain areas may cause it to look a bit patchy. On the plus side, it stays all day long without fading or settling into fine lines, making it truly long-lasting and reliable for a full day of wear. Overall, it's a must-try for those who want a natural yet flawless look with the convenience of all-day wear. * Very light n soft * Recibí este producto a cambio de mi revisión honesta. Me encanto la base es bella deja piel de porcelana ideal para tu día a día, es ligera pero es construible deja la piel súper suave sin nada de textura y el maquillaje se ve bellísimo con ella dura todo el día * I looooved how this looked on my skin but it made me break out so horribly. It was super easy to apply, my skin but better. I could deal with a pimple or two but this had several new ones popping up every day. * Was looking to repurchase CC Tint - not available anymore, I was referred to Rihanna's new makeup 
To my surprise, it's perfect, lightweight and has many colors to choose from. This is my new favorite!! And am recommending it to friends."

Please bring back filter effect! * wowww ,, so in the beginning i wont lie , i avoided buying this one only because i loved their filter focus foundation but i seen its no longer sold in stores and i need a medium or full coverage foundation so this lightweight one.. didnt trust it so much at first. nevertheless, its so good !! 💕💕💕 my makeup is SO smooth and so buildable. I wont lie, the filter focus foundation was a bit more heavy and i could definitely feel the foundation but this one, dont feel it as much. I cant comment as the coverage too much because i color correct with the NYX concealers but so far the foundation does good on top of it ! Would def repurchase, i love morphe sm * I ordered 3 different shades of this foundation. 1 claimed to be neutral and 1 claimed to be cool toned. all 3 turned me so orange and yellow immediately that I looked like I had jaundice. * I would it was a perfect shade match and it sits nicely for. * I used to get them morphe filter effect and loved it. I got perfect medium coverage and not heavy at all. They discontinued it so I tried this one and it feels like nothing is on my face. The coverage is very minimal. Color does not even blend in good. I almost want to keep trying to put more to see if it will show some coverage, but I do not wanna cakey look. Which, oddly it almost looks like that on the first coat with this lightweight foundation. * Great product.Excellent customer service.Good price. * This foundation applies and covers like the much more expensive ""Il Makiage"" brand. It is very light, easy to apply and covers so, so well! Be sure to use a makeup prep so it goes on even better. People have stopped me to ask what I use for foundation!"

After trying to pump it a dozen times with no luck I unscrewed and top and found that the pump straw had fell off and was floating in the foundation.

28,beautycounter,skin twin featherweight foundation,pimprod2038184,2606483," * I truely like the way the foundation glides on and covers. * I had high hopes for this foundation, considering all the positive reviews, but I found it to be subpar. The smell was absolutely terrible, I found the coverage to be uneven, and after an hour or so of wear, I looked in the mirror and it really exaggerated my fine lines and pores. I for sure would not recommend this foundation to anybody over the age of 35. * This is a no for me. It smells terrible and does not work on my skin. Exaggerates dry spots, separates in oily areas, and looks cakey with any amount of product. I've tried applying with fingers, brushes, and sponges. I'm really disappointed I spent so much on it. Drugstore foundations are much better quality than this one! * This is a difficult foundation to work with, the coverage never looks even to me and it's not buildable. up close, I can see it pills on my skin if I pass the sponge over it more than a couple of times. cream products don't layer over it well - it's hard to blend cream blush, bronzer and highlighter on top and it transfers and moves all over the face. It doesn't really set down, even with powder. I have dry skin and never have issues with uneven coverage or getting a foundation to set down, with or without setting powder. I'm just not a fan, I have wet n wild, Catrice, urban decay and Pat McGrath foundations that all perform better across the cost spectrum. * This a wonderful foundation. It gives perfect coverage, making my skin look dewy and fresh.   The best part is that it is a clean product, without the bad stuff.I love this brand. * Not enough coverage for my aging skin! * Unsure. It's not like it's a bad product. I feel it's good quality. I think maybe for a lighter foundation could be a good find. I feel for the price, what my expectations were; not a good buy necessarily. Fell a bit flat for me. I've also only used a couple (2-3) times. Maybe it grows. My skin feels nice.
I don't feel excited afterwords-if that makes sense? Sometimes I put on foundation and I'm like ""OO-Hello there!"" I put this on and feel like…ehh. Best way I can put it. I did have a more positive prospective when adding a glow enhancer. It's ok."

And even with a super light brush application, the powder sits on the skin, making it look fake and amplifying every. single. pore.

It is heavier than other powder products (ie Clinique) so it's not the one I reach for on a regular basis. * I hardly used it and then one day it just crumbled.  Now I can't open it to use without clumps of powder falling out everywhere.  What a waste of money! * This is the best. I love this and have been using for yrs. Will never stop using this product.  I use the regular foundation.  Then I put this on very last.  This is amazing product. * Goes on smoothly and covers very well!  I will purchase it again!! * I have found my forever compact! I absolutely love this coverage! It's weightless but still has complete coverage. I will always buy this compact! The IT products have won me over. I have tried a number of known products and hands down IT has it all! * This is now my favorite foundation. Very light with super coverage and very natural looking. Will continue to buy this again."

First hour it was so pretty but it started to seperate my second and my 3rd hour wearing it. I thought it didnt like my primer so I switched to moisturizer but it still seperated. 6 hours in, some part of my face still intact but the area of my nose, cheeks and mouth already doesnt have foundation. I come to know this foundation doesnt like my cream products as it will moves around i have to keep trying to cover it up. It's a mess * Did match on line face rec. and very yellow so have to blend and bronze * If your looking for full coverage natural looking foundation buy it! Its thick and buildable foundation so apply as you need it * Doesn't settle in my fine lines but definitely emphasizes my pores. I can't even give this a fair wear test because it's so frustrating to get it out of my tools. I used my brush cleaner, two different cleansing oils, and scrubbed for 30 minutes. I'm still not even sure if it came out of my foundation brush * Unfortunately  this is nowhere near as good as urban decay all nighter foundation, i miss it so much..it was full coverage that lasts all day for me, this one doesn't last at all on me ..i keep spending money trying to find something like the urban decay * Foundation is great! I give it a 4 because it is not teven remotely transfer proof! But if it looks good on the skin then I can live with that!"

The store associate Jackie was very knowledgeable and she was the one who recommended the product. * Like others have said I have been using this foundation for years with no problems. I did not realize the formula changed until I received it in the mail with a red sticker that says ""vitamin c"". I am allergic to Vitamin C. I wish cosmetic companies would stop putting skincare in color cosmetics * No matter what shade I would buy it pulls so orange. The coverage is fantastic but I can't get the right shade match * I wore the Loreal Infallible Freshwear 24 hour foundation for years. Summer 2024 i began the sesrch for a new foundation because the reformulation of Infallible includes Vitamin C, which my skin has a negative reaction to if the Vitamin C isn't 15% stabilized Vitamin C (THD Ascorbate).  It is rhe lesser common form of Vit C and typically not what cosmetic companies are using. Therefore, my face breaks out in tiny pustules.  It's been a long search for a foundation that offers the coversge, wear time and finish as the Infallible.  I've settled on Haus Labs Triclone foundation and Milani Conceal and Protect. Really wish makeup companies would stop adding Vitamin C! The amount is trace but enough to be bothersome if allergic. * This was my holy grail foundation for years! Perfect coverage, perfect shade match, perfect price! Now since it's been reformulated, the shade is completely different. I'm very fair with pink undertones and the new formulation has caused my shade to lose the pink undertone to where it no longer works for me. I'm so sad and now on the hunt for a new foundation. * The L'Oréal Infallible Foundation definitely falls short on the full coverage front. If you're looking to cover blemishes or uneven skin tone completely, this product won't be a great fit for you. As layering it doesn't always yield the desired effect, and you might still see some imperfections peeking through. Overall, it's not quite what I hoped for. * The L'Oréal Infallible Foundation definitely falls short on the full coverage front.

However the previous formula was amazing and since it has been discontinued I have never been able to find a shade that perfeftly matches my skin. Such a shame. * BAREPRO 24HR has a great range of colors/tones. It's lightweight and blends easily. I use 3 drops on a brush and it provides a very natural looking full coverage. * We all miss the old formula, this one is okay, still full coverage but it is much for drying, and can add a lot of texture to your skin * This is my first purchase for this foundation. I like to try different brands.
This has great coverage and I like that it's 24 hour wear. So far, my 64 year old skin loves it!
I will definitely purchase again. * Please bring back the performance wear liquid foundation. So disappointing. 😔😔😔 * I don't feel like it matches me * Used the old formula for years. It was beautiful…everything I wanted in a foundation and never made me break out. Literally every other foundation I've tried makes me break out so I thought I could at least count on BareMinerals. Then they changed the formula. The new formula is HEAVY and gross. It's the same as every other trash matte full coverage foundation on the market now… nothing special at all.  The worst part, however, is it gave me cystic acne… something I never experienced with the old formula. Really disappointed. I thought BareMinerals was supposed to be a brand for those with sensitive skin but I feel left behind once again."

Do not recommend * Absolutely one of my holy grails! Beautiful Finish, has some play time when blending, wears well and looks better as the day goes on. * Probably the worst foundation I've tried in years. I did everything to make this foundation work. I switched moisturizers twice, i did a cream primer, a silicone primer and then 2 different spray ones. Nothing worked. It's heavy, doesn't blend, oily. * makes your skin so soft and natural looking.  Great coverage.  I would recommend and purchase again * As a certified Too Faced hater I was beyond skeptical about Polite Society, but I have to say I am blown away by this product. I am a dry skin girl and this keeps me hydrated all day. The wear is beautiful and it is glowy and skin like. One of the best foundations I have tried this year. * I was really holding out hope that this foundation was the ""one"" because I have been looking so hard to find something that works for my skin. It settled into my pores and forehead lines and made them even worse. Now even with no expression I have deep lines in the makeup on my forehead. Ugh. * This foundation starts out looking beautiful but doesnt last but a few hours before it begins to break apart and even look oily. The bottle itself is terrible. I had to pop the pump out to get to the product. I don't know if it's the shape if the bottle or the length of the tube but either way, it's not user friendly."

39,natasha denona,hy-glam powder foundation,pimprod2044289,2624364," * The best powder I have ever found! * The powder is great. Doesn't make my face oily but the smell is terrible. * This powder looks really great. It is a very high price point though. I only bought it since I am in love with powder foundation. The thing is the color range for brown girls isn't that great. The color I got is a little too light. The color after this one is way too red. I am more a golden undertone. Even though the color isn't perfect on me; I will make it work with a darker contour and blend heavily. I love this powder and don't want to return it just because the color is a little off. If you are dry this powder won't work because it's even more drying in the skin. * This powder foundation is my favorite. You can apply it sheerly, but some powder foundations you cannot apply sheerly the way you can this one. However, is it really worth $55?- No.  You can go through it very quickly. In general a bottle of foundation lasts much longer than a compact of powder foundation, and that is true for this one. I probably will not repurchase because I can blow through this stuff, even applied very lightly, in a very short period of time. * No, I didn't drop it or was rough opening or cloding but it snapped off like nothing. Now when i open or close i have to be extremely careful the powder doesn't slip out. 
As for the powder its good. Offers full coverage but can look cakey if reapplied. Lasts about 6 hrs (with setting spray) before it starts to separate a little on thr face. Especially t-zone area. * I really wanted to like this, and the reviews led me to believe that I definitely would. I have combination skin, I'm very pale, and I'm over 40. This was absolutely awful. Cakey, patchy, and settled way more into fine lines than my previous liquid foundation did. Didn't stay on even with my setting spray either. A total miss for me. * Wow, this is the best powder foundation I have ever used and I mean ever I've been a make up artist for years and I have never seen a formula so beautiful on any type of skin. The colors are phenomenal. The range is beautiful. The formula is so blendable and buildable. It's beautiful on top of foundation for setting face. It's beautiful with Mac strobe cream… and other tinted moisturizers. Sometimes I'll use with a powder puff. I don't use the sponge it comes with even on myself. It's a little heavy carries too much product, but sometimes I will use a smaller loose, fluffy brush, especially in the t zone and a powder puff for setting the face. It is beautiful. If you have textured skin, it might seem a little heavy therefore you should use maybe a lighter brush so it doesn't bulk up on your skin, but that has nothing to do with formula. It's just customer error. It doesn't break me out. I am ultra sensitive. I can't use anything with talc in it and this is absolutely perfect. She needs to make a bronzer with this formula or a contour powder because it's probably the only face powder that doesn't break my skin out."

The coverage is light but buildable. It looks natural on my skin and never crepes or settles into lines. I highly recommend! * I love this!!!  It adds a natural glow! * First time I tried this, skin stayed flawless all day. By day, two, the drying effect that this had on my skin, I have never seen before with any other product! My skin looks so dehydrated and dry. I use fabulous skin care and hydrating plumping primers. I never had this problem before with another foundation. So sad because like I said, the first time I used it it looked really beautiful on the skin. I can't believe they advertise this as hydrating. Loaded with alcohol.  :( * I stopped wearing foundation a few years ago and have been more about tints or spot concealing. I saw alot of great reviews. Mind you I'm in my mid 30s and have combo skin. I don't prep my skin(I'm ashamed) lol but i apply about two drops on each side of my face directly to the skin and use my fingers to blend in. I do think its buildable, it feels wet when applied and sets and dries similar to a cream. I've received lots of compliments, it looks like skin but better, just evens things out. This is exactly what I was looking for, something light and natural looking. Also, I am able to apply blush and bronzer as usual without issue. 
Con: There's limited shade ranges I wish they would have a bigger variety for those in between colors. I can see a potential problem with the applicator but I haven't had an issue (less is more) * I am 44, I have tried sooo many different foundations.  I will probably wear this one until I die.  Its that good.  I have decent skin, starting to show some age though.  I have super dry skin so most foundations just look heavy and cakey ans settle into everything.  I hate having to do a leimwr ans then foundation then powder just to look half way decent.  This gives just the right amount of coverage to even my skin tone.  What I love the most is for a lightweight hydrating foundation, IT STAYS PUT!  No need to use a primer or set it with powder which adds to my dryness.  The color range is not great, fortunately for me 2-3 works perfect for winter and 4-5 for summer. Oh and the dropper sucks.  I took a pump off an empty bottle of another foundation that works perfect!  Problem solved there. * I normally wear Armani Luminous Silk foundation but was looking for a lighter foundation/serum that looks as good and I actually think this serum looks better! The color match is great and the serum looks very smooth and bright.

42,charlotte tilbury,airbrush flawless longwear foundation,pimprod2044233,2624530," * Unfortunately, this was one of the foundations i wanted to purchase for a long time. I finally did when it went on sale. Maybe it's my skin. But this is total failure for me. The color changes and becomes more drier. * Doesn't settle in creases moisturizing and breathable all at once and truly stars all day! * Luckily for me the shade i got was too light but the foundation definitely oxidizes so the shade ended up working. My skin looked great (too matte for my taste) BUT this foundation was so drying it made my skin feel tight. I had to douse my face in setting spray to get more of a natural finish. * For that price - no way. It dries up too fast, clings to dry patches, pores are visible after 2 hours, no not airbrushed look at all. Returned it! * Ive used ALOT of foundations in my time and this one is by far my favorite. Ive not been able to find coverage for my entire face without having to apply a concealer but this foundation offers all that coverage with just a little bit. I havent tried to blend with a blender yet but works wonderfully with any of my many makeup brushes!!! * I got this in 10 Neutral and it was more orange than Donald J Trump after a fresh spray tan. The neutral was NOT in the room with us. I'm a medium deep olive girly. In Danessa Myricks serum foundation I'm a 13n, for neutral olive undertones. CT products aren't really known for olive inclusivity but it was the 21 days of sale so I got it. The formula is great! Super long lasting and sits beautifully on the skin. Through the use of a blue mixing pigment I've been able to make it not orange and wearable. If you're a warm toned girlie this is for you, but if you're cool or olive PLEASE get a mixing pigment * Too orange and cakey"
43,it cosmetics,your skin but better foundation + skincare,pimprod2017112,2568683," * First  foundation that actually matched my skin, literally covers everything ans stays on, i wanted to love it but on my first try I noticed dry brown patches after I cleaned my face and  was very dry, not for me 😞 * I love this foundation, it is very lightweight so I had to use a heavy moisturizer and thick primer. It worked well with both NYX and Provedence drugstore primers.

Also my deep skin discoloration are covered with a tiny amount. I use liquid bronzer and blush with it and it pairs well with Pacifica and Maybelline liquid products. Once this foundation dries on your skin, it will break up if you add liquid or oil makeup on top- but as long as I do it all at one it sets the makeup and last for my work day. 

FYI I set my face with pixi skin veil and it wasn't too drying on my dry skin. They recommended I get a shade lighter foundation to cover and it gave me full coverage. The only con is my local Ulta doesn't sell it so I have to buy online. * this is so watery I don't even know how you're supposed to apply it. I wore it for one day and within a few hours started developing a severe rash on my skin that has lasted for several days. would not recommend. * I'm obsessed with this foundation! You don't feel like you are wearing anything! It's life changing! * This is actually a first… I've never experienced a foundation that manages to be extremely watery, yet also cakey at the same time. Unsure what kind of mystery this is, because it's certainly not a good one. Color was also extremely off and orange. Also more on the natural matte side, NOT radiant like it says. * This foundation does exactly what it says,"" Your skin but better"". Absolutely love this foundation. * I wanted to try a light product, but once i applied it, it was a weird textire. I already have oily skin so it made my face very shiny, which was not what i wanted. It also made me break out terribly and unfortunately cause scars on parts of my face."
44,tarte,amazonian clay 16-hour full coverage foundation,pimprod2025023,2581375," * This foundation is not good. I had heard good things about it but I hate it. It's really cakey but doesn't blend into your skin like my previous one did and it also does not blend with concealer. It's the weirdest thing, the concelaer sits on top of the foundation and won't blend and if you try to blend it more it takes everything off and you look even worse. I was using Kay Von d foundation before which is also thicker full coverage but never felt as cakey as this( they discontinued it, that's why I was trying new foundations) and also never made me break out like the tarte one. * I love this product. I love all the shades ut comes in. I tan in the summertime, so its nice to have a slightly darker shade on hand to transition into the summer. It applies nicely and a LITTLE goes a LONG way! Also, if I an looking for a more coverage look, i can use a little more to achieve that. Its long lasting and lightweight! * Ive tried many different foundations, BB, CC creams, etc. this tarte amazonian clay is my anaolute favorite. Smooth, weightless, great coverage. I'm in my mid-30s and stopped wearing makeup because i just wasnt loving how others brands made my skin look and feel. That all changed when i tried this - i actually look forward to doing my makeup now. * This is my go to for everyday makeup! There is no better full coverage foundation out there! * Have been using this foundation for years and really like it 
Unsure as to reason SPF was removed, bad marketing strategy in my opinion! * Can't say enough about this buildable full coverage foundation!   I love it! * I'm 47 with combination skin. I mix this 50/50 with the Tarte BB Blur tinted moisturizer and apply with a damp beauty blender. I have found this to be my absolute winning combination. Flawless, incredible coverage yet not heavy or cakey. I recommended to a friend and she was floored. Ladies, if you find the Amazonian Clay Foundation too heavy, mix it with a tinted moisturizer, it is literally magical!!!"
45,laura mercier,real flawless weightless perfecting waterproof foundation,pimprod2038437,2608627," * I loved the Oil Free silk crème photo foundation. Not sure why it was changed or discontinued. But this new stuff is awful. Not even close to the quality I have come to love from LM. The new formula dries my face out and does not blend well. I thew away the bottle after 2 uses and went back to IT. * As someone with skin picking disorder and ridiculously sensitive skin, finding a foundation that is kind to my skin, while not enhancing texture is next to impossible. I'm on the hunt for my wedding foundation, and I think I have found the winner. This foundation really is flawless, like the name suggests. I have some lines on my forehead and scabs everywhere most of the time. This foundation never sinks into my forehad lines or causes my scabs to flake or stand out. It conceals magnificently. I prime/prep with my normal skin care routine. After foundation, I set with the new Fenty setting spray and sometimes add on the saie translucent loose setting powder to my lines. This dream combination lasts all day and is almost completely transfer proof. 

I am ghostly pale and very cool toned. My only frustratuon is that the lightest shade (1C1) goes on as the PERFECT shade, then dries down darker and more warm. Laura Mercier, PLEASE expand your shade range or look into the dry down,  because this formulation is unmatched! * Feels so light a fresh feeling on my face * I usually wear higher end foundation with a heftier price tag, but this is a dream. So blendable, medium coverage, and so skin like. Pair it with the brands luminescent finishing powder and feel like a supermodel! * Being that there were mixed reviews, decided to give a try for myself. However, i did have high expectations but unfortunately I ended up being disappointed. This foundation, in my opinion, is for normal, pore less skin.  If you have texture and large pores, this will definitely enhances those features. * I am a 48 year old with combination skin. This foundation goes on smooth and hides pores without looking cakey. A little goes a long way. I use one pump, sometimes a half pump for my entire face and neck. It feels extremely light and lasts all day. I recommend. * I have struggled for years to find a color that can do what this does and be light yet with coverage. Amazing!!! I love it!"

However, even on bad application days, a couple hours later I'm always amazed by how amazing my skin looks. * This goes on light and smooth. Gives nice coverage when you want to look natural. Has SPF 30. * I needed a replacement for my favorite Les Beiges tinted SPF moisturizer by Chanel, which was discontinued :(. An ULTA assistant pointed me in the direction of Laura Mercier's tinted moisturizer with SPF, which has been great (I'm on my third tube—each has lasted me about 9 months with daily use). I like how this product lightly balances out redness, gives a subtle glow, doesn't bother my skin, and is breathable. * I'm very picky when it comes to base makeup. I have dry/normal skin, a light-medium olive skintone, and I deal with dullness/discoloration. Shade 2N1 is a good shade match for me. I've enjoyed using this with a dense foundation brush. It's easy to sheer out or build up. I would describe it as light/medium coverage. It evens out my skin tone, but doesn't cover blemishes. Its very comfortable on the skin, it feels like a moisturizer, the consistency is thick at first, but it doesn't feel like anything when blended out. I can wear it without powder and it stays on all day for me. Definitely repurchasing. * I've been using this product for years!  I don't like thick heavy coverage so this is very light buildable coverage.  I have pretty good skin, 38 years old, cheeks are pink from dryness with few blemishes and this provides me full coverage.  I do add a thin layer of moisturizer (especially now that I'm older and less oily) and concealer for under my eyes, nose and any glaring blemishes.  It's a very natural finish that does pull warm.  I use 2N1 for my winter everyday color and 2W1 for summer when I'm tanned (it's very yellow/gold). * The Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer goes on nicely,  bur doesnt cover ANY imperfections. Some pilling.  I was hoping to love it, but will be returning it."

I would not buy again. * i have pretty dry skin and my undereyes normally crease pretty quickly, but i've had no issues with this foundation! the only little drawback i've found is it's hard to set with powder and the foundation ends up a little tacky. it doesn't accentuate my dry skin at all, though, which obviously i love. pretty similar to the tirtir cushion foundation, but is a little thicker. * I bought this foundation a month ago because it was recommended by a worker in ulta. Although I told her I had oily skin she told me that it was good to use. It emphasized all my texture, made me more oily than usual and it is so bad in general because it visibly patches. I definitely DO NOT recommend this to anyone with oily skin * This foundation goes on well and looks pretty but does NOT last. I have normal (not dry or oily) skin and I put it on and an hour later I look like I'm sweating even if I set it with powder and setting spray. I just don't think it's worth the money as it doesn't work as advertised. * Love this for older skin * This foundation goes on like a dream with great medium build able coverage. It does not settle in fine lines  and seems to blur pores. The finish has a natural glow and keeps skin looking and feeling hydrated all day. I have had no issues with transfer.

My problem is that the lightest neutral and cool shades are still too dark."

Do not buy! * I was expecting a little more coverage but does feel like skin. It looks beautiful but on acne days not even with a few layers it doesn't add to much coverage. * I'm so impressed by this foundation and have told all my friends about it. My skin looks incredible with it on and it applies so nicely, very light but great coverage! I dont even wear concealer with it! I put on a light moisturizer (I use Caudalie vinoperfect) and then apply the foundation with a brush. 5 stars!!! * This may be the worst foundation I've ever tried; I could not get this to apply correctly-i tried a brush, sponge and my fingers-there was just no applying this stuff. It was somewhat watery but I could not get it to spread on my face-i don't think I've ever had that happen with a foundation.  I wish I could give it 0 stars. * Looks very nice on * The best!"

I had just about given up on foundation.  It is very easy to use and best color match.   It is pricey but worth it.   It also takes the place of concealer. * My favorite foundation but you don't get enough for the price!  The foundation really covers and goes on nicely.  I'm only giving this 3 stars because it's just too expensive for the amount of product you get. I go through this very fast! * If your skin is any less smooth than glass, it will fill every pore like spackling on a wall and highlight all texture. Although it blends smoothly on smooth areas, you can see every iota of texture and every pore that the product settles into. * I though because of the brand and price it would be something i would be coming back for. But i liked nothing about this product including how it looked on skin, how it felt on the skin, how it blended, the brush that it comes with is almost worthless.

I am obsessed with this! I immediately purchased a second bottle. * This was a new foundation for me, I got a good deal during the spring beauty sale. So far I like it but not sure if I'd pay full price but definitely worth trying. * Light but effective coverage. Blends well. Prohibits oil build even after wearing all day!  Smooth without showing fine lines. I am 51 and have some signs of aging - this definitely gives me the younger look. * love the color and smell and feel,but can't wear it as it makes my eyes look like a raccoon within hours of wearing it. even with waterproof/smudge proof liner/mascara * This product is very nice.  However, matching to my skin has been a challenge...it took three color match sessions and still not right.  I use it lightly to avoid a weird color look.  too bad because it is a really good product. * I love it sooo much it's light weight and good coverage but still looks like healthy glowing skin for me and I am obsessed with it * I just bought this ! I barely have used and its gone already!? For such an expensive product you would think it would last longer. Such a waste. And NO I do not use a ton when doing make up."
56,about-face,the performer skin-focused foundation,pimprod2043010,2618950," * This is a great skin finish foundation that doesn't clog pores, crease, or crack. Their neutral shades are actually neutral and don't pull grey on dark skin. My only complaint is that the doe foot applicator is too big for the mouth of the bottle. You have to use some strength to pull it out and because the formula is pretty liquid-y, it splatters. * I LOVE this foundation. Super comfortable, hydrating (I have skin drier than the Sahara Desert), lightweight on the skin, buildable coverage, no fragrance, and it's actually NEUTRAL. This foundation plays well with other products from the brand very well and even works with products from other brands. I'm honestly very impressed and can't wait to see how it wears throughout the day. * The original L2olive was the only fair olive shade I have ever been able to find. But they must have changed the formula because now it's ORANGE. Noticeable difference between this and my old bottle which was actually fair olive. Now I'm on the hunt for a new foundation…so sad because I really did love this one. I hope someday they'll fix the color :( * at first i really liked it this foundation because it was affordable, lightweight and easy to blend. however after wearing it for a few months, i began to notice my skin becoming very oily and i would break out the next day right after using it! I never had that problem before until i started using it. Im also not a fan of the applicator, i like the size of it but i feel that i have to be very careful when removing it from the bottle because it'll splatter everywhere. * I have been looking for a every day foundation that looks like skin and this is it. ESPECIALLY FOR US OLIVE SKIN GIRLIES, THIS IS THE GRAIL!!!!! 

It's lightweight-don't feel a thing
Build able coverage
doesn't oxidize and doesn't create horrible crease lines at my smile lines and doesn't create those foundation patches. 
Best thing is it's affordable compared to other high ends foundations I've wasted money on. 

I haven't worn for the 12hr wearability claim, but for 5 hrs the makeup was unmovable. * This foundation is super natural with a medium coverage, however i build her up and mattify her with a powder. She looks amazing last all day! And doesnt clog my pores! I have combination skin and my skin is quite sensitive. But ive loved this one. I can go natural, glam, matte, dewy! Everything! Shes so good and on top of that it has 17 skincare products! So thats why i belive it might be breaking some people out. Due to the fact that some products might break them out. I would deff look into the ingredients before purchasing. But im telling you if you prep your skin and give her a few secs to set on your skin for a more full coverage you will love it! * I ordered L2Cool, and it is a perfect shade match for my normal skin tone (not tanned), and i plan on ordering a shade darker to match my summer shade. It doesn't feel excessively heavy on my skin and blends out pretty evenly with a sponge. It also plays well with NYX ProFix Stick Concealer, but not so well with thr niacinimide hydrogrip primer from elf. Im noticing it seems to separate half way through the day if i use them together."
57,charlotte tilbury,charlotte's beautiful skin foundation,pimprod2043365,2619495," * This foundation is pretty and dewy but it doesn't set for anything and gets greasy super fast. Definitely not long term wear, but if youre looking for something lightweight/buildable and like the super dewy look it could work. Only super bad con is how easily it transfers on to anything one touch to the face and that spot has no foundation and its on whatever touched ur face. Makes products impossible to blend because the foundation underneath doesnt stay put. * Run dont walk mature ladies this foumdation is bluring andnflawless leaving behind a subtle flown and healthy skin * I got this product and first of all the girl matched me completely wrong like 3 shades darker. And second of all, WHY did my foundation turn grey ? * Eh it's not really for me. It sat on top of my skin and oxidized over time. It might work for some people but just not for me. * As my skin starts to show signs of aging, I've been having a difficult time finding a good foundation. I have spent nearly $1000 in the last several months trying to find a good foundation. My normal go to is just don't go well with my skin anymore. They always look very thick and cakey and oily, etc… 

I went in one day and one of the employees at my local Ulta recommended this one. I was hesitant at first and didn't buy it that day because of the price. Like I said, I've already spent a ton of money on foundations. I didn't like. I went back about a week later and got it. Had it shipped to my house cause they were out of stock. finally arrived. I let it sit on my counter. Has it to try it for about a week finally put it on last night with the airbrush pressed powder. I am obsessed. This is so smooth the color matches perfection, it looks like I have nothing on. It's very refreshing. * I was really excited to try this foundation out given all the hype around it and the brand but man I was soooo oily, my face had enough oil to fry an egg…No matter if i set it with powder or setting spray. Disappointed, especially, at the price point. Might work with those with extreme dry skin * I used 1N and sadly, as most brands do, they ""reformulated"" it and it now has a very warm undertone and shade is medium."
58,dior,dior forever foundation fluid matte,pimprod2036825,2604875," * I am 55 and have combination skin. This foundation is my favorite. Of course, I wear skincare and SPF underneath which keeps it from being too matte. I use a little setting powder in my T zone, and it lasts until I take off my makeup. I have never once had a problem with it transferring to my clothing, but I wear a light shade, so maybe the richer shade pigments are different. I have also worn this in all seasons with no issues. I will definitely repurchase. * It's been a struggle to make this foundation work on my 53yo menopausal skin. These are my tips that can make it beautiful if you have skin like mine.  Use a good but lightweight moisturizer. I found that Vanicream works best. And a hydrating primer is a must. I use Tarte Double Duty Base Tape Hydrating Primer. In my opinion, this looks better blending with your fingers instead of a brush or sponge. And use the smallest amount possible cause it goes from zero to cakey in a blink. And I would say not to use powder. Occasionally, I will use just the lightest kiss of the hourglass powder but it's a risk, and honestly it sets well without powder. I work 12 hour shifts at night so my makeup is on usually 18 hours and this stuff lasts better than anything, with only a little touchup needed at the end of the day. * I really have oil skin and this base makes my makeup look naturak but feels matte i really loke it * The foundation is amazing! It is perfect full coverage withou feeling ir kooking heavy. I have oily skin and this gives me a matte finish. Pricey but worth it! * Words can describe how much love I have for this foundation. As an oily skin girly, i love the matte finish. Will definitely buy again and again. * My skin tends to be sensituve, and I used this foundation thinking this product and the ingredients were the best because it's ""Dior"". After using it for a few days (before realizing it was the problem), my face brone out in hives and cystic acne that unlike anything I have ever experienced. It was so bad, I didn't leave my house for a week! Now I am left with scars on my face that could take years to recover from. I dont know if it's the ethylhexyl salicylate, alcohol, or mystery frangance in this ish, but I wouldn't wish what happened to me on my worst enemy. Dont touch this stuff with a 10 ft pole!!!

I'm trying not to hold it against ""Dior"" or Ulta, but the fact that they're even letting this stuff stay on the market baffles me. Dont use this. * If you have tried the YSL matte foundation and you're looking for a less expensive version this is it! It smells amazing, has the SPF and stays on matte. I live in AZ where if is hot and this does not feel heavy or cakey."

60,clinique,acne solutions liquid makeup foundation,pimprod2043524,2619813," * I used this foundation for about 10 years. It was my holly grail! Went on smooth and never broke me out. However, the last bottle I purchased was nothing but a disaster. Constant break outs, it clings to any dry patches…but over all it looks extremly cakey and dry on the skin. I tried multiple different moisturizers and primers but nothing seemed to work. I then decided to look into it and read that the formula had been changed. How unfortunate…I went out and purchashed a completely different foundation of another brand that has given me no problems. I would NOT recommend this foundation. * It was perfect!! I'm buying it for all of my friends * I don't know if I'm not doing something right, but it definitely doesn't give you smooth coverage. It looks dry, flakey, and inconsistent. I used primer and my sponge was wet. I also tried doing it without primer with a wet sponge, and also a dry sponge with no luck. Super disappointed that a bottle of decently expensive foundation is going to waste 😭. The only pro of this is foundation is that it doesn't cause acne. * A great color match. Easy on my acne prone skin. So glad this product is available. A dream come true for me. Also covers up roscea like magic. I have a darker version for the summer months. This color I am writing about will get used when there isn't much sun in Ohio. * I love this foundation! It is so good for my skin type (sensitive and some spotting) it has a medium coverage but you can defined build it up. * Use to love this. It oxidizes right to orange. For reference I was using 10 Alabaster. * I have used this product for years. It made my skin look amazing. Within the last six months something has changed in the formula. Now after application my face looks cakey and orange. Please go back to the original formula! Now I am going to be on the search for a new foundation."
61,fenty beauty by rihanna,eaze drop blur + smooth foundation stick,pimprod2041564,2614177," * I did not realize this was more of a skin tint when I bought it, works wonderfully nevertheless! I usually gravitate towards foundation sticks because they're workable and clean to use, and this product is exactly that. Easy to apply and get light-to-medium coverage. If you are looking for full coverage, THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT. However, I do love using this product in the summer because it feels comfortable on the skin! * I have been using this foundation since it came out.  I LOVE it.  It gives a nice natural look.  I receive so many compliments stating that my skin is so smooth and beautiful.  I also use Fenty skin care so it could be a combination of great skin care products (which is most important), and a great foundation stick. * At my age (56 y/o), I've tried all kinds of foundations, many brands, but this is the best ever! First with so many shades, I was pleased to find my perfect shade, I get so many compliments on how pretty my skin is. Second, it goes on smooth, blends easily, and doesn't smudge after it's set. The only problem I have—finding my shade in stock in stores, I suppose it's very common. I do recommend it to everyone who asks. * Not used to a stick version, but I do like it. Goes on smooth, probably could have matched my color better, but it is perfect for the current tone of my skin right now. Perfect coverage without it looking like I am wearing layers of product! * I bought this product when I was looking for a light, everyday foundation. Although it checked both of these wants off of my list, I would not recommend this product if you have oily, textured skin like I do. I found the product is light and easy to apply, but accentuates all of the texture and pores on my face. I've also noticed the product slips around my oily skin after just a few hours of wear. Unfortunately I wouldn't reccomend if you have oily, textured skin. * I HATE how foundation feels on my skin and when it looks cakey. But this one doesnt feel heavy at all and looks sooooo natural. Only foundation I use * It's a very light foundation and powder"
62,fenty beauty by rihanna,soft'lit naturally luminous hydrating longwear foundation,pimprod2045514,2624152," * I have very dry skin but have never had an issue with texture from foundation. I do not need primer for foundation to adhere or last. I set all foundations with loose powder. My skin is not perfect but it is even enough in tone and texture that I mostly only wear eye makeup and translucent powder. Foundation is something I use for photoshoots  or special events. I have a special event at the end of the month so I'm breaking out the full face for the first time in 3 years.

I spent an hour in Ulta swatching every foundation to find a replacement for the last product I used which was discontinued a few years ago. Instead I found I had no choices due to poor color matches (and the ones suggested by the Findation tool were laughably off). The only brand that came close to my shade (for reference I used to wear Peach Perfect in Marshmallow and Colourpop concealer in 7C) was Fenty. Both foundations in 100 and the tint in shade 1. The Soft Matte foundation was slightly more yellow so I selected the Luminous foundation which had a more pink tone. 

I prepped my clean face with my usual moisturizer, Clinique Moisture Surge Intense, and applied with a damp beauty sponge. Applied that way it was sheer, streaky, and gathered notably in my pores. My T-zone had a terrible appearance of pink skin with bright beige spots and blotches. I have never had any product gather or settle in pores prior to the 12 hr point before, and certainly not AT APPLICATION. To give it a chance I removed everything and tried again, without the moisturizer base. I tried applying to my forehead with a flat top foundation brush, which gave my face the texture of sliced crumbly bread. I tried again with my fingers and a puff, essentially fingerpainting my face and then blending and pressing it into the skin with the puff. I got the best texture this way. But it still looked like curdled milk, especially in my T-zone and upper lip.

 For a luminous hydrating foundation, this was the worst I've ever worked with and looked horrendous, including the ELF foundation that gave my full-face hives for a month. It's truly a shame, because color 100 matched my face and neck perfectly. I'm returning it immediately. * wonderful * I have incredibly sensitive skin. For those of us with this condition, it is so difficult to find foundation that covers and does not cause breakouts or a rash.  I'm glad I tried just one more product.  This foundation gives me the coverage I want (its buildable) and most of all, is not causing a rash.  I also have had zero issue with breakouts.  For me, at age 62, I avoid products that give me acne-type breakouts and magnify my wrinkles.  This product does neither.  I highly recommend. * This is a great match. It also has great coverage. * I have to say I have tried so many foundations over the years and this is the first one I put on that litterally made my combo textured skin look like a snapchat filter! It blends beautifully and my other products just melt in with the look. This also doesn't transfer or feel wet on the skin like most other ""luminous"" foundations do. It has a true radiant natural finish … not too glowly but not matte either.  I just set with a little elf halo glow setting powder and I couldn't be happier. Will definitely be purchasing again! * I purchased this based on all the positive reviews for this foundation, and it worked for about 2 months perfectly. if you have an olive skin tone, the shade range is unmatched. However after traveling from a dry state to a humid state, it started to separate and pill super bad. I've tried different variations of skin prep to see if it was something I was doing wrong, but regardless of what I do, it's not working for me anymore. it clings to dry spots that I didn't know were there, it separates immediately and seeps into my fine lines. you can see every single pore. I've had it for less than 6 months so I don't think it's expired yet. 

 idk if this product doesn't travel well or if I messed it up by bringing it on the plane, but I haven't been able to use it since. I haven't had any other issues like this with previous foundations so idk what's up with fenty but this wasn't it. 
I do have sensitive skin and this wasn't irritating for me. when it works, the coverage is great and had beautiful coverage. but I will not be repurchasing and would not recommend it. 

I use naturium face wash, serum and liquid exfoliate, dermacologica exfoliate, la Roche posay lipkar cream and rotate between eltamd and haruharu for sunscreen. I've tried eliminating some steps, waited 20+ mins before application and nothing seems to work anymore. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I was trying to wait to do a review until I could use on set at a shoot for a model, 
But I haven't been able to do that. 
But, these foundations are great. The undertones are fantastic and not orange, which i usually find to be the case. It feels soft and lightweight on the skin, and lasted a wear test (not on my face) well. I'll come back and update this for sure when I use on set with a model!"

So happy I found this! * Its a georgous skin tint, easy to blend with the hands and melts right in, however, it tuns a bit dark.  I got no. 2 (the second lightest shade) and it was just a smidge too dark. Dark enough where if you were close enough you'd be able to see the difference. Overall though its really pretty. * I bought this because of how good their concealer is and the reviews on this product. Ive used tinted moisturizers before so I kind of knew what to expect. This was not it. It was super watery and barely any coverage at all. Very tacky and oily feeling. * This was my first skin tint and was highly recommended. It's very lightweight and I feel like it will be great for summer. I have dry skin and this really helped * too watery not good coverage. * My skin looks and feels so good in this makeup.

It doesn't stay on if I want to travel with it in my makeup bag, and I've dropped the bottle by picking it up by its 2.5""lid several times.   Packaging needs work.   I'd only refer it to a friend with the warning about poor ability to close it and keep the pump sanitary. * I liked this foundation a lot! It matched my skin tone really well, and is a really affordable price. It's a nice size, and usually lasts me over four months to finish. The only bad thing is that it takes a while to blend in and I find myself having to go over it with a beauty blender or brush a lot. I do still really like it though and it covers up many imperfections. * The best foundation ever!!!!!! * Patchy, greasy , I was disappointed ☹️ * Great price so, I thought to give it a try. It's not a bad foundation but not one that squeals excitement. Blends pretty well but after a while it seems to pool into lines and makes imperfections noticeable.

I see less oily face especially after a concert my foundation still looks amazing! I recommend!! * I'm 33 and it doesn't look good on my skin. I have dry sensitive skin and this showed dry patches. I've tried so many different primers (water, silicone) and moisturizers but nothing looked good with it. I'm giving it two stars because it does stay on your face for awhile but just didn't sit right on my skin. Really sad because the all nighter was my favorite foundation * I love this foundation and am on my 3rd bottle of it. I have oily skin that eats through foundation. I've tried Fenty, Estee Lauder, Milani, etc. This foundation holds up 10x better than any of those after a full day.

 I will say I do use setting powder and spray despite it being ""self setting"" because my skin is just that oily. But I've used the same routine with other foundations and had horrible results so I know it's the Urban Decay foundation that's doing most of the work.

I also have rosacea and this does a good job covering it up without making it look like I'm wearing a mask. It has a really smooth finish & doesn't feel heavy at all. 

I also love the bottle design and the fact that I can get every drop out when it's running low. I hope they continue to make this for a long time. * I have been struggling to find a good foundation that was full coverage, but did not feel like you were literally wearing a mask!! This has been such a gamechanger!! I apply with a brush, and it stays on all day, and still looks great at the end of the day! * This is the best foundation that money can buy.

66,jane iredale,purepressed base mineral foundation refill,pimprod2033383,2595091," * I have been using this for almost 25 years, nothing can beat it. It was originally created by a plastic surgeon for her patients after surgery at her practice. Then it made it's way to estheticians and finally retail.  The coverage is fantastic. I live in Florida's heat and humidity and it stands up to it perfectly. I personally believe the sunscreen has helped me to keep the sun damage at bay as well. I saw a review that said it had sparkles. I have never seen that in all this time. Perhaps it was confused with the BM label??? I use the Real Techniques powder sponge (the one thats super light and airy) as it does not come with an applicator. Also it does not come in a compact. My suggestion is to try it and then purchase theirs after you fall in love with it or decide it is not for you. I have had my current compact for about 6 years and it is easy to pop in the next refill. There is a little hole in the back that is about the size of a paper clip tip and you can just push it out. There is a magnet that holds it in place. It really does save on throwing everything in a landfill. It finishes beautifully with PS On Till Dawn setting spray. I will say that as my skin has ""matured"" I do not try to use as much as my skin is drying up. BTW i use it as a setting powder , hence the trying to back off some as i have aged, but it is great as just a foundation too. Hope this review helps. This stuff is like a secret miracle. (I dont work for them. My friend was an esthetician and turned me on to it as I am a long time makeup fan) * It doesn't say that the product has sparkles - I don't do sparkles on foundation, it looks childish. Also, the finish is not ""skin-like"" but very mate. That's a no for me. * This stuff feels like you have nothing on your face and doesn't irritate my super sensitive skin at all. The light beige is the best color match I've ever had for my cool skin tone. The only drawback is I wish it wasn't so expensive. * Love this product. Light weight. Comfortable and covers nicely. Just blurs the imperfections without looking like a mask. I have freckles so this is perfect. * Giving this 5 stars even though I will be returning it. I recently figured out that I am sensitive to Zinc Oxide sunscreen, which explains why this broke me out, even though its ingredients are so minimal and acne safe. I got itchy and developed a few pimples from wearing this. HOWEVER! This is an amazing foundation, and I am so upset that it has to leave my collection. It's a powder, but it's almost creamy on the skin and blurred the flaky texture on my cheeks. The coverage was a perfect medium but could be built up. I am combination dry and acne prone, and without the zinc oxide, this would've been my forever foundation. * I never thought I'd become a powder foundation girl, but I'm obsessed with this foundation! It blends so well, I have oily, textured, fuzzy haired skin and always stayed away from powder foundations, until I couldn't take the oily mess from liquid foundations anymore and gave this one a try! My eyes are very sensitive, and I was baffled my how much I loved this foundation. I apply over my moisturizer and lasts all day.

Only cons: can't color match at Ulta stores, and a bit pricey - but so worth it! * I've used this makeup for years. I love that it is light buildable coverage with SPF protection."

Its just plain ugly. Ive never experienced anything like it. I also never leave reviews but after many months of trial and disappointment, I felt compelled to tell you to save your money. Love Dior generally good grief * A makeup artist applied this shade and it looked identical to my Cool tone pale skin. I was given a sample and used it at home. The color faded and turned out whiter than my skin tone. Half of my face was white and the other side was my natural pale skin with rosacea. Applied to entire face and I see streaks on my cheeks and it doesn't set well with Setting spray. I wanted to love this but its not giving me a natural dewy finish or the same color match. Too white! * This is actually the worst foundation I've ever used. I don't understand any positive reviews?? Cakey, oxidized, and hard to wash off. My skin looked more even and glowy before I put this junk on. Dior should stick to making handbags. * Best foundation ever. * The foundation goes on smoothly it gives a natural finish but gets so freaking blotchy and basically disappears when wearing after an hour or two not worth the price * I love the foundation looks flawy but after 5 hours i get patchy spots in my face.

I bought the lightest shade available on Ulta (130N) and it is slightly too dark and definitely not neutral. It pulls orange out of the bottle, and it oxidizes even more. I have watched it turn orange in seconds after putting some on the back of my hand. I've had to mix it with a lighter skin tint to get the right shade, which means I lose some coverage...but at least I'm not a floating orange head on a pale neck! * This is one of my go to foundations for the winter when i get a little paler and a lot dryer. It has amazing buildable coverage, applies nicely, and its one of the few that i can find a true color match in. 
HOWEVER, this needs new packaging. The twist on lid with the pump applicator? Trash. Its always loose, pumps out inconsistent amounts of product and quite frankly for the price point i shouldnt have to worry about that. I cant even travel with it without it spilling in my makeup case…like whats the point if i cant bring it with me when i go out of town?
It honestly needs the new bottle that her new foundation just got (the matte one?) and maybe just have a glossy bottle? 
What do i know im just a consumer 😭😭
Still love the actual product though. * Your cool under tones has to much yellow under tones.. need to make it without adding golden or beige into the mixer never have been able to find a match that didn't look to yellow on me. * I hardly write reviews but this is review worthy. I have acne prone skin.  I also have drier skin as well. I read where people say it's too thin or too heavy. Honestly, it depends on how you build it up. it is build able coverage. If you're seeing texture and fine lines, be sure to set it with powder. Brush the powder off, and finish with a spray. The morphe luminous setting spray pairs like a DREAM. This is the only foundation I will buy ever. If I had the money I'd buy like 10 back ups just incase. I moisturize, prime, conceal, foundation, powder set, set spray. This is how I would layer it. Not including blush, bronzer, contour, etc. Even with added layers I don't believe it's heavy. It very much gives, skin. Because this is infused with skin loving ingredients I can wear this all day. I'm talking a full 12+ hours. Gym, errands, everything and it holds up beautiful. It actually looks better over time. It almost melts into my skin more and just looks even more natural by the end of the night. IT DOES NOT OXIDIZE!! 🥰 There's so many good things I can say about this. My cons, the pump. Over time the pump does stick. That needs worked on. I've bought probably 10 bottles and they all do it over the course of 2 years so I'd say it's for sure the design of the pump. but the formula is worth it but be mindful it can get messy if you don't pull the pump back up. This is worth your money 100% regardless. sometimes we avoid wearing makeup because our skin is broken out, but I actually wear this when I'm breaking out because I swear when I wash it off I feel like my skin is better. * The shade match is amazing but every time Ive tried this foundation it left me feeling horrible about how I look. Ive spent a long time trying tk make this work in MANY different ways, used almost the entire bottle over time because its my backup ""emergency"" foundation. No matter what, my face looks caked and it settles in horribly. No matter how you spin it, it does not look like skin in real life."

I have been getting compliments on this foundation ever since I started using it. * Perfect coverage for me.  Sheer and glowing, not thick.  highly recommend for spring and summer! * This is a great foundation for all day wear…love you * My NEW favorite! Gorgeous and  color is perfect. * I will always use this! My forever foundation! This is my perfect match, it looks just like my skin. It feels so comfortable, and it's so easy to apply. It's hydrating and dewy, non cakey and it doesnt settle. It looks natural but you can build for a more flawless look. Plus it has spf! Its just the perfect foundation! How has this not blown up in popularity!? * This was the best product ever and i cannot believe i was able to get my hands on it. it feels so good on me, its so light and i love the color pay off and the pigmentation. of it all on my skin. it doesn't dry me out. it was gifted by tanologissttan * I love the coverage and I love that it doesn't look like I have makeup on"

But this product caused me to break out in a rash all over my forehead. I was out and about on vacation and noticed my forehead was itching and later that night, after scratching all day - I noticed a horrible rash all over my forehead. I wouldn't even say I have sensitive skin normally, so I dont know why this happened. But I will never use it again. * I was so excited to try this product, I know Tula is a great brand!

I've put 4 people on to this product already. And it has the ingredients of a mineral sunscreen, so thats another plus * I'm combination skin and it did not work with my skin. It's very shiny and greasy, magnifies all my pores and blemishes unfortunately. It was a gift from my friend but i wouldn't repurchase it. Maybe it works for you if you have dry skin. * I use to have their old formula that was in a blue squeeze bottle. This formula is much more thick and has caused my chin to break out terribly. Never again. * Great coverage while protecting from the sun. Will recommend!😊"
71,mac,studio fix fluid spf15 24hr matte foundation + oil control,pimprod2044825,2622175," * This product gives full coverage and goes along way with a little use * The new formula is completely useless and not worth the price tag! It separates all over leaving greasy, cakey clumps and if you attempt to touch up to fix it, it comes off! I gave it 3 tries and it was awful every time. I am moving on to a different brand. * Let me begin by saying, im a LOYAL mac foundation girly of 10 years. Its heartbreaking to find out they discontinued the previous formula and replaced it w this garbage…. PLS bring back the original formula!! * Let me begin by saying, im a LOYAL mac foundation girly of 10 years. Its heartbreaking to find out they discontinued the previous formula and replaced it w this garbage…. PLS bring back the original formula!! * Not best quality for the money. * The new formula is so SO bad. Doesn't blend well, is completely different than the other one. Looks like drug store makeup at an expensive price tag! They RUINED this foundation. Read the reviews and tried to give it a chance. It looks horrible! Don't waste your money. Please bring the old formula back!! * First of all, the shades changed and my usual shade was no longer matching so I had to get rematched and could not find a good match. I finally purchased one that was ""close enough"". When I got around to wearing it for a night out, it was terrible!! It dries super fast at application, but I was able to adjust, not a big deal. The coverage is very light now, I had to build up to get decent coverage and I assumed it would look great as I stepped out the door. Big fail!! I checked my makeup an hour later and was shocked at how bad it looked! My skin looked dry and chalky, it had settled into all my pores and fine lines and was starting to separate! I touched up as best as I could and checked again after about another hour…it looked worse! It had settled on every pore, fine line, it was cakey around my nose, mouth, it was separating into ""clumps"" all over my face and my skin looked unbelievably greasy! I tried to touch up again but it just came off on my fingers and powder brush! It was so frustrating and embarrassing dealing with this absolutely horrible foundation on my face while I was at an event. If you want to try it for yourself, I suggest you don't wear it for anything important! Better yet, I suggest you don't waste your time, energy or money on this totally useless and terrible foundation."
72,l'orÃ©al,infallible 24h fresh wear foundation in a powder,pimprod2021871,2575170," * Since my review a month ago, I started wearing a light amount of this powder foundation over tinted moisturizer. It really looks nice. It is not dry or flat looking at all. I use a fluffy, flatish blush brush to lightly powder my entire face.  My face has a nice glow. I recommend. * Infallible 24hr is fabulous 👌  takes 10 years of my face  
I LUV it!!!!!! * I tried using this over a mineral sunscreen and a chemical sunscreen. Both left dots of the powder foundation settle in my pores, making them more prominent. I had high hopes for this product after seeing reviews, but it didn't work for me. * I use this as concealer under my eyes, on my lids  and to cover dark spots over my light foundation. It works well and lasts all day.  I wouldn't care for it as foundation, but its good concealer. I have 125 Ivory Buff, but will get a lighter shade next time. But this shade is workable. * I had high hops for this as a quick solution to early mornings.  It was very chalky feeling on my skin. * This is a great powder foundation for the price. Has a scent but nothing too overpowering. I hate scented makeup but this one isn't so bad. * I love this product it makes me feel confident cause I know it's going to last me all day."
73,chanel,les beiges water-fresh tint,pimprod2030055,2574253," * This is the best moisturizing tint ive ever used and im never switching back to anything else. 

It applies really smoothly and evenly and nicely. The little brush that it comes with is perfect. It settles on the skin perfectly and lasts all day. I love this so much im buying another one for my mom. My skin looks fabulous. 

My skin doesnt feel dry at all and looks like i have a glowy natural filter on it. 

It also layered really nicely with my supergoop sunscreen so i didnt have any issue on that. 

This tint pairs beatifully with the chanel blushes too like the application looks flawless and i always struggle with finding a blush compatible with foundations/tints.

Its also super light doesnt feel like i have anything on my skin. * I have tried a lot of skin tints and have been left less than satisfied. I decided to give the Chanel water tint a try and am so happy i did! Yes, its crazy expensive but well worth it for me. 

I have ""mature"", dry skin with mild rosacea and this tint doesn't cling to my dry patches and leaves my skin looking hydrated and healthy. It is extremely light weight and feels like I'm wearing moisturizer.  The coverage is perfect for me and covers the redness on my cheeks.  This is finally a product for ""my skin but better"". * I was very apprehensive about purchasing this product after reading some negative comments. After all, it is not cheap. Finally, I read the review that said that it is for women who love natural looks, and that is me! I don't like a lot of make-up. I like to see my own skin even out color-wise. I am so glad I took a chance on it. I got so many compliments, even from my teenage daughter (!!!). My skin is radiant, the color is even, and it looks like I have nothing on. 
Give it a try, because this product is a HIT! * This just got delivered so immediately tried this on fresh clean hydrated skin. Im 35 with normal/dry skin. This went on like butter. Its light, sheer, with a dewy fresh finish. This is going to be perfect for the everyday ""no make up"" look I was after. * Love this! Easy to apply, very light and brightens  my face! * I'm 42, and when it comes to foundation, I'm incredibly picky—there are very few I truly love. I generally prefer skin tints, and I've tried almost all of them, but the Chanel Water Tint is by far the most beautiful one I've ever used. It's sheer, but it enhances the skin in the most natural way! I'm beyond happy with my purchase and can confidently say this will be a forever repurchase for me. It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny."
74,clinique,even better refresh hydrating and repairing makeup foundation,pimprod2004194,2541677," * This is the foundation that me & my family all wear. Clinique has no other foundation with full coverage & a natural finish. I'm so bummed I'll have to find a foundation to use in a different brand. * Love this foundation for my combination skin. * I won't even allow this product to come near my face. It contains an astonishing TWELVE separate forms of silicone (including dimethicone as the 2nd ingredient, following water). This has more silicone than most silicone-based face primers, so if this is what you are seeking, just buy a cheap silicone-based primer and powder; I think you'd end up with a similar result. Even with all it's additives, it still lacks sunscreen (chemical or physical), although the thought of adding sunscreen to this already pore-stifling mixture makes my face sweat just thinking about it.

With a name like Clinique, we except you to formulate proceducts with skin-loving ingredients. Cosmetics companies can no longer get away with adding whatever cheap ingredients they wish in order to achieve the façade of temporarily healthy skin. Consumers have educated themselves and we know too much now.

Do better, Clinique. * Great product * I had high hopes for this foundation since it was described as for very dry mature skin.  Nope, too thick, wrong color choice (my mistake), no matter how lightly I applied it still caked in creases & wrinkles. * Easy application and coverage. * I'm 61. Larger pores than most. Have fine lines & imperfections etc. I have a large supply of foundations. Everything from high-end to drugstore brands. I like full coverage, but I don't like it to feel heavy or settle in my lines. This stuff is awesome! Goes on like silk, covers beautifully and stays all day. I recommended to others who feel the exact same way. This reminds me of a CC cream, but with better coverage. 100% recommend!"
75,kvd beauty,good apple skin-perfecting hydrating foundation balm,pimprod2022990,2577085," * My skin is normal. This foundation has a beautiful finish that (on me) looks even better as my (minimal) natural oils appear by the end of the day. A little goes a very long way! This plays well with my usual skincare/primer/setting products. I keep it in my travel bag so I can always look flawless on trips! * I've been using for four days now and it makes my eyes water all day long it's awful it clays up on your face in a couple hours this product was not for me * Great coverage good color match good lasting coverage * I love this foundation because you get super coverage with very little product and your skin feels light and not at all like some cream foundations.  They have such a great selection of colors that I found a perfect, natural match. * I will buy this again and again.  My original makeup Dermablend was not available from the company so some ladies helped me find this and it's amazing!!! It feels like heaven on my face light and it gives great coverage. * Do NOT use the AI foundation match. It's incorrect and Ulta sent me the wrong shade (literally orange). I had to go in store to correct it due to being locked out of my account and Ulta refusing to let me access it over the phone.The product itself is good, Ulta online is horrible. * I used to have this when I worked at Ulta and repurchased it after decluttering.  I forgot how good it looks."
76,chanel,les beiges healthy glow foundation hydration and longwear,pimprod2030080,2571508," * Goodbye foundation.  Mixed with sai chefs kiss * Beautiful finish, glides on smoothly with just the right amount of coverage. * It was soo good. I thought it was going itch my face because some foundation be making my skin red but this one did not do anything it worked really good. * Love how this is so buttery on the skin but most of the days I use it, I get breakout the next day which is more likely caused by this product. * I used to think foundation just wasn't for me. It felt heavy, drying, snd clinged to any and all dry patches on my skin revealing creases I never new to be imaginable. However, after finally caving in and buying my first Chanel product, being this foundation, I fell in love. It leaves a beautiful, luminous finish to the skin that looks like ""your skin but better"", while still providing a little coverage. I'm telling you, I get compliments on it whenever I go out. If your having any doubts GET. THIS. * Works very well and is the inly foundation that has matched perfectly with my skin. I wokld always have to mix my foundations since i am very white complected. Very happy with my purchase and will now use this forever 🥰 * Ive used many high end foundatjoms and always return to this . It truly is the best ! In my opinion . I have dry to normal and have mature skin . Been wearing for 10 years . Sometimes i switch to others but come back ! Bd21 shade"

I live in the south so sometimes the consistency is a little too thick for humidity but such an easy fix. Add a little moisturizer to the back of your hand and mix. Label says acts as concealer also. Absolutely, just a dab with the applicator and Pur perfection. * Love the coverage, couldn't tell if any was on * I'm over 40 and i absolutely love it highly recommend * I really wanted to love this product as much as I loved the clean ingredients. Unfortunately, it added a lot of texture around acne spots. I think also the shade wasn't my exact match but it's really limited in store and didn't want to wait again to not be satisfied so I ended up returning it. * This is the best foundation i have ever tried!!Been using for years!! Every so often i make the mistake of trying something new and always go back, nothing compares. This went on sale about a week ago bought a few to stock up but then i started overthinking and worrying about  why it was on sale, ""was it because were going to discontinue?!"" .. Any whoooo I really never ever write reviews but im just here to say, please dont ever discontinue! * I'm really picky about foundation and it took me years to find one that works for me. I used to be a matte girl because of my super oily skin but as I've gotten older i have too many lines and crepes for that to look good anymore. Couple that with the fact that everything makes me break out and it's impossible to find a good match until this! This strikes the balance between dewy and matte so I have a youthful glow without looking like a grease slick. It lasts well if I set it with powder and I love that it works as concealer too. The dual purpose applicator is great. The fact that it goes by undertone makes the color match the best i have found. I haven't had issues with breakouts either! Perfection! * It moves and settles into the creases around my eyes and shows every pore. I hate it."

My face looks illuminated. I love it. * I did not like this foundation. It didn't look matte or light-reflecting at all. It looked like drugstore makeup that was applied poorly and sat as a second layer on my face. I would not buy this again and especially not at its price point. * To watery. Not sure if this is a one off. * This is my favorite foundation by far. Applys easy. A little goes a long way. It blends well with my skin and doesnt break me out. * This is my favorite foundation by far. Applys easy. A little goes a long way.

You get the no-makeup makeup look effortlessly. I don't use a brush or sponge to apply, just my fingers, and a dime size covers my face. I got lucky; I stocked up before y'all sold it out! Yet, I'm glad you all found something that fits well! * Great color and application however through out the day starts to leave my skin a little greasy. * I've bought this twice now , trying to get it to work for me. I've used it with primer, no primer, fingers, sponge, brush. Its always peels and looks terrible. I'm pretty knowlegable when it comes to makeup and I've used alot of different foundations. I love Chanel and love some of their other foundation, but not this one. * I've been wearing this for 4 years and will never buy another.  It goes on light and easy, adds a nice luminous glow to my skin and provides even and light coverage. * Thank goodness ULTA Carrie's this now!! The ONLY foundation that does NOT settle in your fine lines and I have mega lines still doesn't settle, I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION, please chanel never discontinue this! * I love how my skin feels with this Chanel foundation it looks and feels so smooth. I've been using it for five years now. * I've literally tried 5 foundations in the last 2 months all claiming to do the same thing. I have acne scars very large pores deep smile lines that collect the makeup.... And I'm 53. All the nightmares!!!!  This foundation!!!  I mean common!!!  It covered everything!  It blurred the pores on my nose, which nothing ever has, it didn't settle it those deep lines, even the ones in the corner of my mouth!!!  I looked Dewey all day!  I felt like I was wearing nothing. It wasn't even the right shade cause they were out but I just used a bit of bronzer and omg perfection!!  I will never ever use anything else. Yes it's a bit fragrant but that disappears in a few hours no big deal."

The coverage is good, but does not last very long. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I decided to use this tinted moisturizer now that it is getting nicer out and saw it has spf. It matches my skin well, the coverage is settle which I prefer and can layer. Overall I like it so far and will continue using! * This tinted moisturizer is very lightweight and easily blended. It doesn't have a lot of coverage but I think that's kind of the point. It works well for what it is. I like that it has spf in it but I do I wish there was a little higher spf coverage in it. I received this for free to review."
84,polite society,more than a pretty face skin-caring foundation,pimprod2040619,2615146," * This foundation had great potential, until it starts, settling into all of your lines and pores, and the pump breaks so you reach out to their customer service only need to have a multiple month battle just to get a pump replaced which never showed up by the way. Do not recommend * Absolutely one of my holy grails! Beautiful Finish, has some play time when blending, wears well and looks better as the day goes on. * Probably the worst foundation I've tried in years. I did everything to make this foundation work. I switched moisturizers twice, i did a cream primer, a silicone primer and then 2 different spray ones. Nothing worked. It's heavy, doesn't blend, oily. * makes your skin so soft and natural looking.  Great coverage.  I would recommend and purchase again * As a certified Too Faced hater I was beyond skeptical about Polite Society, but I have to say I am blown away by this product. I am a dry skin girl and this keeps me hydrated all day. The wear is beautiful and it is glowy and skin like. One of the best foundations I have tried this year. * I was really holding out hope that this foundation was the ""one"" because I have been looking so hard to find something that works for my skin. It settled into my pores and forehead lines and made them even worse. Now even with no expression I have deep lines in the makeup on my forehead. Ugh. * This foundation starts out looking beautiful but doesnt last but a few hours before it begins to break apart and even look oily. The bottle itself is terrible. I had to pop the pump out to get to the product. I don't know if it's the shape if the bottle or the length of the tube but either way, it's not user friendly."

They're all either too dark or too light. I figured I'd try a more expensive one and hope for the best. I am fairly disappointed. While the color matches great, the dropper use basically just aesthetic because it doesn't work at all. The foundation when applied and spread it pills and doesn't spread very well at all. * I got this because I think EL double-wear is gods gift to makeup. I'm very disappointed in the skin tint :/ * Considering how expensive this is, you'd think it would look flawless. It's the worst skin product I've ever used. It takes a while for it to settle into the skin and it looks very oily at the end of the day, it's cakey around the nose and doesn't set well with primer. SPF 20 is basically pointless. Once I finish the bottle, I will not purchase again. * It pilled on my skin n looked blotchy. Guess it wasn't good over my skin prep. I use Depology products to prep. * I love the look and feel of this foundation. It provides more of a natural glow than anything I've tried before. It stays on all day without feeling heavy and works with my sensitive skin. * I love this product so much! It goes on smoothly and looks so natural. It doesn't look cakey and has great coverage! I would highly recommend this. * This did not work well over my skincare products and did not compliment my skin when paired without it."

This one feels too liquidy for a foundation, creases easily& not the greatest coverage. Why only have one option in stores? Please bring back filter effect! * wowww ,, so in the beginning i wont lie , i avoided buying this one only because i loved their filter focus foundation but i seen its no longer sold in stores and i need a medium or full coverage foundation so this lightweight one.. didnt trust it so much at first. nevertheless, its so good !! 💕💕💕 my makeup is SO smooth and so buildable. I wont lie, the filter focus foundation was a bit more heavy and i could definitely feel the foundation but this one, dont feel it as much. I cant comment as the coverage too much because i color correct with the NYX concealers but so far the foundation does good on top of it ! Would def repurchase, i love morphe sm * I ordered 3 different shades of this foundation. 1 claimed to be neutral and 1 claimed to be cool toned. all 3 turned me so orange and yellow immediately that I looked like I had jaundice. * I would it was a perfect shade match and it sits nicely for. * I used to get them morphe filter effect and loved it. I got perfect medium coverage and not heavy at all. They discontinued it so I tried this one and it feels like nothing is on my face. The coverage is very minimal. Color does not even blend in good. I almost want to keep trying to put more to see if it will show some coverage, but I do not wanna cakey look. Which, oddly it almost looks like that on the first coat with this lightweight foundation. * Great product.Excellent customer service.Good price. * This foundation applies and covers like the much more expensive ""Il Makiage"" brand. It is very light, easy to apply and covers so, so well! Be sure to use a makeup prep so it goes on even better. People have stopped me to ask what I use for foundation!"

I came across this, and figured I'd try it since I like the original Double Wear foundation. I love this! It's lightweight, evens my skin tone, has SPF in it, and has decent coverage. Plus, it does not break me out! Will definitely purchase this again. * This ""foundation"" gives no coverage and it's so watery. I put it on my face and immediately wiped it off. I wanted a lighter feel than double wear foundation but it's horrible. * This foundation is terrible. It has no coverage and never dries. You will walk around sticky all day, which I hate, but you may not mind. It was sticky and wet even after setting with powder. I will be returning it. * This foundation does give light coverage, but it gives a beautiful satin finish that lasts all day. It is meant to be sheerer than the original Double Wear, and shouldn't be compared to that. This is a little more than a skin tint that doesn't leave your face feeling sticky. It dries down nicely, feels weightless and is perfect if you don't want full coverage. I hope this formula is never discontinued! * This is definitely one of my favorite foundations I've ever used. I'm still bummed they took it out of stores. * I love the texture of this product. It's very serumy and truly lovely on the skin. I have dry skin and it looks so nice and glowy yet never greasy. It's good for day to day. I love the color too. I have light medium olive skin and the coverage is enough to where it blends just fine. Not a holy grail, but a consistent go-to. * This 👏 product 👏 is 👏 incredible 👏!! It makes my skin look like skin, just perfected!! It does not look like I have makeup on! It evens out my skintone and adds the perfect amount of coverage for every day, especially during hot summer days. I bought this because I was on the hunt for something that would be lighter and not melt off my face in a gross cakey way in the heat, and this is it!! I wish I tried it sooner!!"

It reminds me of It Cosmetics Foundation but a fraction of the price. Love this product! * This has been the best CC cream I owned. It works fantastic and looks so natural. * Way too drying, even though I moisturize well. I'd hate to experience the non-""hydrating"" camo cream! Very tacky, not smooth. Lighter than the swatch indicated. I can work with it, but I'm disappointed. * 4.5 stars! Love this product, best color match to my warm leaning neutral light skin tone! Love that it is sheer enough to have my freckles pop through and wears well. The only downside is the pump-its not great and is unnecessarily messy. * Was disappointed did not apply well even with the elf primer. Looked terrible the minute I put it on. * Great coverage but NOT hydrating or dewy at ALL. It was thick and super cakey so it clung to all my dry patches :( I was so disappointed * This CC cream is actually really nice. I like the coverage and light feeling."
90,urban decay cosmetics,hydromaniac tinted moisturizer,pimprod2021082,2567739," * Foundation has a nice dewy finish, and as an acne prone girlie i find that this foundation has not caused any new breakouts or skin issues. Doesnt feel too heavy on the skin either. 

However this transfers so much! I've tried it by itself, and I've used it with various primers, including sticky/grippy ones, and my go to setting powders and sprays - nothing seems to keep this foundation down on my skin. Even just touching my face with my finger leaves a patchy spot on my face and foundation on my finger. Dabbing with a napkin after eating yields the same result - splotchy face and stained napkin. 

Not sure if its just not friends with my skin type or if this a problem with the masses, can't recommend this foundation due to how much it transfers * Love, love this foundation! Good coverage and doesn't feel heavy! Perfect for every day wear!! * I have dry skin so this is foundation is perfect!! It hydrated my skin and it feels light weight while still having good coverage. This does leave a dewy finish, and sometimes could be too dewy but nothing powder can't help with. I'll buy this product everytime! * I wanted to like this product because the weightless nature of it is very appealing, but it made me look like an Oompa Loompa. * I first bought this to replace my Pacifica Alight tinted moisturizer, since i wanted a little bit more coverage. Once I figured out less is more, ive loved it ever since. Definitely better coverage than the Pacifica, but the product isnt as thin so it takes more effort to blend but you dont need as much product to do so. I have combo skin and some tinted moisturizer/foundation emphasized dry areas, but THIS makes my skin apear so dewy without looking greasy. I have makeup on throughout the day and this never caused my skin to break out from sweating in it. * I first bought this to replace my Pacifica Alight tinted moisturizer, since i wanted a little bit more coverage.

It wears wonderfully and is my new go to * This is the same thing as the estee lauder double wear foundation. You cannot convince me otherwide. They are the exact same formula, only the hydra resue has spf. It is not moisturing at all. Dry skin is not going to work well with this. If you want a super matte finish, extremely full coverage foundation that you can wear for 14 days and it not come off, you might like this. If you like the double wear, this is identical. * Too runny for me * Liked the foundation but beauty consultant was of no help whatsoever.  Had to return foundation because color was so off.  It gave me a chalky, pasty look. Almost ghost like.  Went to Von Muer and the consultant gave me a perfect match. * I love this foundation.  It has SPF 50, and is easy to apply.  It looks natural and stays very well. * Love this...Doesn't set up in my fine lines like most"

I am 59 and finding a foundation that covers and not look gross is really hard.  SO yes, finding one even at this price that does, is worth it to me   I save up my points and use that to offset the price as needed * Hey girl, we gotta talk. Why would you do this to us??? This formula is flawless, I cant even feel it on. It is GORGEOUS. How am I supposed to continue to buy this? It is way out of my budget but I splurged for my birhday and now im trying to figure out how to sell my soul to the Chanel gods because i have to use this every day and I will run out! You knocked it out of the park with this one and now all I can think about is what other amazing Chanel products am I missing out on by having the wrong number in my bank account?!!! This is perfection and I just had to say it. * Finally found a cool toned foundation that doesn't oxidize and turn orange! I love everything about this foundation and it has become my go to. Lightweight so you don't need to use a lot, buildable coverage, liquid or powder blush goes on over it well. All around recommend and will keep buying it! * I get compliments on my skin EVERYTIME i wear this. Its second to none. So underrated. I have combination and sensitive skin. * This is a nice foundation but I don't find this foundation particularly luminous. To me it's almost a soft matte. I have to add oil to it to achieve any luminosity. coverage is a solid medium and I would consider it buildable. I don't find it great for dry mature skin.  It can look a little cakey if not applied in thin layers. I will finish it but won't repurchase. For my skin type I much prefer the Healthy Glow foundation as an all purpose foundation. This foundation is more full glam for me. * This is my new favorite foundation. I can apply it with my hands, brush, sponge and it always looks so beautiful and natural. The color match is perfect and it lasts throughout my entire 8 hour work day and beyond. I cannot recommend this enough. I also do have oily/combo skin."

The color L30N matches my skin perfectly. * Is this going to live up to the discontinued Studio Skin 24hr? I don't think anything will, and I was hesitant to try this out due to a lot of negative reviews. I'm very pleased with the coverage, longevity (oily skin), and shade range! * I was honestly not going to buy this based on the reviews, but I did anyway because this has a fair olive shade which is difficult to find. this foundation is a great match for a pale neutral-warm olive, and it feels like im not wearing makeup (sensory friendly). 

I am allergic to a lot of makeup but not this. it did not cause my acne prone skin to break out. * Let me tell you I have tried a  million foundations and this one leaves your skin glowing ! No oxidizing not too oily but not to too drying 
Please DONT discontinue !! * I did my own wedding makeup and this foundation looked amazing all night. I was so happy with it! 10/10 * I loved this product! The bottle, the color match, the way it sets but i have combi skin and it broke apart and got shiny * I bought 2 shades . Im in my 40's with combo skin.  I got L10N and L20. Heres my opinion: Its a bit yellow toned to me. Go in person to buy it. It gets darker as it oxidizes, so the lighter ended up the best shade.You have to apply it quickly as it drys down fast, it looks a bit masky upon first applying, but melts into the skin within a few minutes and looks really good for the most part. It does not settle into fine lines or wrinkles. But it transfers really bad onto everything and starts looking worn off and patchy on dry spots as the day goes on. It just wasn't good for me for the price. I would not buy again or recommend."

The shade 312 seems it is for tan skintones but for me the hue changed to an orange tone. 322 was too dark for me Will be returning both unfortunately * My skin looked and felt horribly dry after using this.  No natural or dewy finish at all.  
I will be returning it * Saw this reviewed in a magazine so I figured I'd try it. I love this product, the review didn't steer me wrong. It provides  nice coverage without feeling heavy or cakey.  And you can't beat the price, plus Ulta always has coupons😊 * Beautiful skin tint, even for oily mature skin * I cannot gatekeep this wonderful product. It gives the perfect amount of coverage for those looking to have a little something on their skin without doing full foundation. * love love love for my combination skin! has a nice natural glow * I switched to this from Maybelline's 24hr superstay full coverage foundation and I don't see myself going back. It's lighter and more forgivable and blends so easily. I have combination dry around the nose and mouth and an oily t-zone and this has worked well in all areas. I use a moistened beauty blender and it comes out flawless every application. the finish is very dewy and natural. I usually have my makeup on for 15+ hours a day and it does not budge at all.  Highly recommend!"
96,l'orÃ©al,true match super-blendable foundation,pimprod2034733,2602421," * I was very surprised by this product. I've always used the infallible line by L'Oreal, but I felt like it was getting too heavy for my liking. This foundation was a pleasant surprise. I did use the ""shade finder"" tool online, and I picked the right shade first try. it feels comfortable and lightweight with just enough coverage to still feel ""natural."" it blends nicely with any tool. I haven't tried it without a setting spray yet, but it seems to last for hours, I'll have to test out longevity otherwise. * Personally this foundation doesnt crease for me and is very buildable but ive noticed it oxidizes ALOT so I dong plan on using it anymore * Ive tried many foundations from drugstore to high end and one of my biggest struggles is finding a good foundation match without it having either such an intense warm underone or it being to cool. This one set beautifully with my skin prep and it was lightweight and showed no visable oxidization after having it on for hours ! Such a great find for such an afforable price considering its performance * But watch out, because it oxidizes very badly too. * This is a good makeup for drier skin. Coverage is medium to light, not a heavier concealer type foundation.   I just wish they hadn't cut product size into half of what it used to be.  (like every manufacturer). * love the shade range and it looked promising right after i put it on, but it hasn't been a full day yet and it's already creasing, showing every pore, and highlighting dry patches/flakes i didn't even know i had (i'm oily/combo). it also oxidized a little bit, it's noticeably yellower now than it was a few hours ago. maybe it just doesn't agree with my skin prep (i always use the milk hydro grip primer), but i don't want to reinvent my usual routine for this one foundation. i'll have to pass on it :( * I initially liked this foundation but found that it looked caulky abd patchy on my skin, particularly around fine lines and drier parts of my face. Its a pass for me and I threw out the remaining priduct."
97,estÃ©e lauder,double wear stay in place matte powder foundation refill,pimprod2031253,2593713," * I love this foundation. I first tried the stay wear liquid but I found that I like the stay wear powder foundation better. I have combination skin with hormonal acne and it doesn't aggravate my acne at all. I usually just get a under the skin bump or two on my chin a week before my cycle and this foundation doesn't make it worse or aggravate it in any way. I don't have any injections or fillers and I have some fine lines and it doesn't sit in those lines making me look older so I definitely like that. I take good care of my skin and  believe in aging gracefully. I know I am getting older and the wrinkles are coming but thats okay with me. My smile lines are from the wonderful smiles and laughs I've had and I wear them proudly. I eat a healthy diet, workout every morning and I only drink water and my skin reflects that and looks healthy. Just because we age doesn't mean we won't look good anymore. Healthy, glowing skin is beautiful at any age in my opinion. So, I use this powder foundation all year round and I definitely recommend using a good primer for your skin type before applying this foundation. It definitely keeps it looks good thru your work day. I use to solely use Clinique and I still use their eye shadow, mascara, blush and skincare but I had a good friend introduce me to this foundation and I literally ran out to get it lol. Just remember every day you wake up is a gift and a chance to shine :) * Once I apply Esstee's  Double wear foundation I use her compact powder to set the foundation.  It is a perfect complement to the foundation. * Love products * I wear 1c1 in winter but 2c1 in summer,I love how easy it is to change out shades with these refills. It's a wonderful, flexible formula that's never cakey. * I buy ivorynude (one if the lightest shades).The color mathecs perfects, at first. However, with a couple hours, my makeup looks a couple shades darker. I have worn this on my tropical vacations and it holds against water, still looking perfect. If you buy a couple shades lighter, it may work for you. * Love the smooth look 👌 * I am 47 with normal to dry skin. Full coverage long lasting!"

It gives such a beautiful satin finish that is not too matte and not too glowy just perfect. I will definitely buy this again and I've recommended it to quite a few of my friends and they love it as well! * I have been trying to decide why I am not reaching for this foundation and I have come to the conclusion I may have gotten an old bottle. The texture is thick and gel like; not what I would expect from a ""nude natural"" foundation. Looks cakey. and when I shake it I don't hear or feel any movement in the bottle. It doesn't really smell spoiled although it does have a fragrance as Dior does. I have tried thinning it out with oil or moisturizer but then it doesn't dry down as it should. I am disappointed but don't know if it's actually the product or that I received  an old bottle. Unfortunately I tossed the box. It's not impossible as I have received  expired products from the warehouse on a couple of other occasions. But I have definitely had better foundations that cost less. * I was not wowed by this foundation. maybe my color match wasn't the best. I am fair to light with a neutral leaning slightly warm complexion and I don't think there is a great match for me in this product. I did not find this product to look very natural or give me any sort of radiance. I felt it looked semi matte rather than a natural finish. Coverage was fine-light to medium as expected. I much prefer Chanel's Healthy Glow foundation. I have mature skin and think perhaps this foundation is better suited to a younger customer. I didn't dislike it but I would not repurchase it. For me it looked rather flat no matter how I prepped my skin. * This is a fantastic foundation! It's lightweight and  leaves me looking naturally flawless. I will say it doesn't completely cover dark spots/acne but I am personally fine with that- nothing a little concealer can't help with. I will definitely be repurchasing. * Wonderful product! * This is the best foundation that I have tried in at least the last 5 years of searching for ""the one"".  Not too heavy or too light. Not cakey and does not settle into my fine lines. This foundation lasts throughout the workday and well into the evening. Definitely worth the price. Finally!  I've found the one!! * Here's a quick review you can use for Dior foundation at Ulta:

""I absolutely love how smooth the Dior foundation applies to my skin! It blends effortlessly, giving me a flawless finish that feels lightweight yet provides great coverage. The formula feels luxurious, and it lasts all day without creasing or feeling heavy. Whether you're going for a natural look or building it up for full glam, this foundation is a game-changer. Highly recommend trying it out—you won't be disappointed!"""
99,mac,studio radiance serum powered foundation,pimprod2040797,2613967," * Stays on pretty long * I usually use the now discontinued Studio Fix Formula and decided to give this one a try. This foundation was very dewy, it makes your skin look oily and shiny. Because it is so dewy the foundation moves as you apply bronzer and blush over it. I would not buy again. * i have pretty dry skin and my undereyes normally crease pretty quickly, but i've had no issues with this foundation! the only little drawback i've found is it's hard to set with powder and the foundation ends up a little tacky. it doesn't accentuate my dry skin at all, though, which obviously i love. pretty similar to the tirtir cushion foundation, but is a little thicker. * I bought this foundation a month ago because it was recommended by a worker in ulta. Although I told her I had oily skin she told me that it was good to use. It emphasized all my texture, made me more oily than usual and it is so bad in general because it visibly patches. I definitely DO NOT recommend this to anyone with oily skin * This foundation goes on well and looks pretty but does NOT last. I have normal (not dry or oily) skin and I put it on and an hour later I look like I'm sweating even if I set it with powder and setting spray. I just don't think it's worth the money as it doesn't work as advertised. * Love this for older skin * This foundation goes on like a dream with great medium build able coverage. It does not settle in fine lines  and seems to blur pores. The finish has a natural glow and keeps skin looking and feeling hydrated all day. I have had no issues with transfer. I was color matched in store for NC17, which I thought was too light but I was wrong! I did put moisturizer and a light amount of skin oil to my drier areas before application, but no formal primer.

I can wear it over a good primer instead of foundation and setting powder on some days. The finish is amazing!  The color selection is very good and this is great for touch ups at work or out and about. I keep one in my desk at work as well as my purse, love it!!!! * I have used this on and off and find it is a good reliable powder that always has a smooth and matte finish and wears well. I find the formula very matte, so it can be dry. Affordable and accessible. I would recommend to those with normal to oily skin. * Gets the job done in summer when it's hotter and more humid. Applies easily with a foundation brush, doesn't get cakey or dry. No need to blend since it's a powder. Powder blush goes over it and blends easily. I also like how quickly and cleanly this applies, vs. liquid products. * This product contains silica which can damage DNA and the nano particles can help your skin asorb the harmful ingredients of the other trash makeup you're buying! * The best powder foundation ive found and ive tried many. Here's a list of ones ive tried and i still like this better than: Make Up For Ever blurring powder foundation, Bareminerals original loose powder mineral foundation, Jane Iredale loose powder foundation, Jane Iredale pressed powder foundation, Tarte Amazonian Clay loose powder foundation. So yeah — ive tried A LOT. Everytime i come back to this one, i question why i keep trying to find something better. Make sure to first prep your skin with a good moisturizer and primer before applying. Let both fully absorb and dry before applying a powder foundation. This is simply the best ive found and each time i wear it, i get told how good my skin looks and even most recently, how i look like im still in my 20s lol. Im way past 20s. * I purchased the Maybelline Super Stay Up To 24 Hour Hyrbid Powder Foundation in shade 118 as an alternative to a luxury brand I typically use. This powder foundation not only covers better than the luxury brand, it looks and performs better, for a third of the price! The shade is also a perfect match for my fair but olive skintone, not to pink or yellow, just right. I am 37 with dry skin and this still works for me. It does not settle into fine lines, crease, cake up, or become shiny throughout the day. I wear it to work every day and am considering it as my wedding foundation for later this year! I apply it with a brush when I want less coverage and with the accompanying sponge when I want more coverage. It lasts all day and does not transfer. I typically use a setting spray afterwards but even when I forget it still lasts and looks good. I just cant say enough good things about this product!"

102,tarte,amazonian clay blurring powder foundation,pimprod2036934,2604704," * Creamy, yet light. Feels good on the skin. * I usually use the shape tape pressed powder foundation, but i wanted to give this a try. Definitely going back to the shape tape because this makes my skin feel like clay by the end of the day. The shape tape foundation usually doesnt lift on my jose after wearing my sunglasses, but this powder comes right off and theres no blending it back to look normal. I also feel like i have to wash my face sooner bevause it feels so tight and uncomfortable after 6-7 hours of wear. I felt like i looked cake-y right after application too, and thats not a normal thing for me. Im going to finish the powder, but I won't be purchasing this pressed foundation again. * I have tarte's Amazonian clay liquid in my rotation of foundations, and loved the coverage. I wanted something to cover my shiny nose mid-day, gave this a try. 

This is just awful. Streaky somehow even when applied with a brush. I'd say it sits on top of the skin awkwardly, but I think it actually breaks the laws of physics and hovers several mm above the skin out in space, yet still streaky. If i use enough to combat the oily nose sheen, then it looks like pancake makeup. Using setting spray is not useful, because that causes it to settle into every texture on my face. I end up needing to constantly mess with this to get it to look good, exactly what i was trying to avoid by using this powder. 

I've tried everything. * There are very few options for powder for the minimal make up gen xer that I am. Sometimes I just want to cover some of the shine, so hopelessly out of fashion of me I know but real life skin has things that I want to cover and foundation powder had been my friend for many years. Out of the slim pickings this was my choice. Immediate negative was that the pan was loose from the compact and I had to find my glue dots to fix. The coverage is fine and I like the more minimal compact but I don't think it would survive in a purse. Which is the clutch point as to why i love powder compacts, you can put them in your bag and they survive. Absolutely loved playing with my grandma's compact and wish that beautiful compacts would come back because we need something easy and elegant in this world. * The pressed powder is very fine and delicate, creating a natural makeup finish that looks like naturally flawless skin. It doesn't control oil or provide coverage, but I don't think that's a big issue because it's already incredibly convenient. * Normally I use with my pore smooth as a primer for work then my setting spray. Sometimes I will use a tinted moisturizer or milk flex stick under. Mainly in the winter. As a combo/oily kinda gal, it lasts through work in the restaurant industry and sweating during the summer. I have my summer medium shade and my winter light shade. I am about to be 49 and starting to get fine smile lines around my eyes and mouth. It doesn't settle like others I tried which is important to me. My go to must have can't be without. Ask my hubby 😁 * I was informed by a women at ulta that the powder concealer from tarte that I used was discontinued and that this was it's replacement. I mentioned to her I had sensitive skin and was told there would be no issue as it was a minor ingredient change. this was in fact not the case. I wasted my money on this product as I am not fully covered in hives and welts to the extend I had to take a benadryl. if you have sensitive skin please use with caution. this product differs greatly from their previous one."
103,pat mcgrath labs,skin fetish: sublime perfection foundation,pimprod2040434,2613894," * This product has such a light consistency, ince it dries down its like wearing nothing. Lovely medium coverage that can be built upon. Makes skin look perfected and lasts all day * This is such a beautiful foundation. It give enough to cover redness and uneven tones but still looks natural and not heavy. You dont even know you have anything on. Beautiful for mature skin. * Since my diet is vegan it is important to know that my favorite foundation is vegan as well. I get THE MOST compliments on my skin when im wearing this foundation. It is extremely lightweight and goes on like a dream. Perfect amount of coverage and never streaks or cracks. Amazing quality worth the investment. Nothing else beats this! * I was not sure about this after seeing complaints about stinging, tightness, and so on. I use a high strength retinol in the winter so skin tends to be sensitive and dry now (Jan.) I was pleasantly surprised that this serum felt great for me. Obviously, lots of people are sensitive to this, but I was lucky. It actually feels hydrating.

It is easy to blend but the ""runny"" reviews are 100% correct. I build in a number of passes or just use a good concealer + a couple of pumps.

Now, the color choices. Even for a lighter coverage foundation, Ulta's availability of shades was inadequate. I got a ""yellow neutral"" shade because there were no pink or just neutrals in my depth in stock. It works ok since I usually do not build coverage, but I don't understand why they added neutral to descriptions. It is a straight-up warm foundation, although it is not as intensely yellow as some other brands. 

I am not sorry I purchased and wear this every day. Not sure I would recommend at this price point for most people for the trickiness of application, difficulty matching, and risk of sensitivity. I would probably repurchase but only with full shade range like other brands with 40+ (not sure if we can name?) * if I could marry a makeup product I would marry this one. I hate the feeling of foundation on my face and this one looks like skin and feels like skincare. I have put my sisters, my mother, my friends all on this product and everyone is amazed. * I was looking for a new foundation. I get full coverage without the dryness and cracking that other products caused. This product produces a flawless look. * This foundation has many positive attributes. It has a lovely natural finish and a great shade range. It feels like a serum and blends beautifully. I so wanted to love this because the shade was perfect which is unusual for me. Unfortunately, it felt terrible on my face. Granted, I have dry, mature skin but I'm not particularly sensitive. I could not get past the tight feeling from the alcohol in this. It made my skin sting, feel tight and look dry as the day wore on. I felt it wore very well but it also caused some redness for me. I tried several moisturizers, oils and primers and nothing helped. so it's definitely a NO for me. It felt like a strange polymer on my face. However, for anyone not sensitive to a high alcohol content I would still recommend it. It truly is a beautiful foundation and if it was reformulated without so much alcohol I would try it again."
104,hourglass,vanish seamless finish foundation stick,pimprod2020481,2575932," * She went on so nicely, that at first, I was obsessed. That quickly dissipated as I wore her throughout the day. She broke apart, leaving a weird finish on skin. It still looked ok from afar but the moment you got close it was a disaster. I tried and tried again. I thought maybe it's my sunscreen, my serum, my moisturizer. But no matter what I switched out, the same thing happened - goes on great and breaks apart in an hour or two. I returned her :( * I have oily/combo acne prone skin. This product is great on my oily sections and provides a full coverage. It has an insane amount of product, I have used a lot of it and ive had it for over a year yet still have half. It can cling to my pimples a little bit but as i wear it through the day it blends into it. * I have used Hourglass (which I prefer) as well as IT Cosmetics and both have changed the description for their products (from a name to a number and vice versa). I have a number on my Hourglass stick and unfortunately can't reorder online. So frustrating!
IT doesn't even have the description on the product so that sealed the deal for them. Makes no sense why they make it so hard for the consumer. * Good color match and formula. Problem packaging, amount of product, and price. The product was stuck to the cap. I was able to get the product out and place it in a tiny jar. Packaging needs redesign for the price. Can't recommend for this reason. * No matter which technique I try, the outcome is always the same: it cracks, transfers, and looks terrible after just half an hour. It exacerbates my acne, making me feel like I've wasted my money 😞 * I was really excited to try this foundation as I have heard a makeup artist I watch on youtube obsess over it for years. I tried this foundation two times and returned it after the second try. Both times I wore it, it gave the same poor results. This foundation does provide full coverage which was exciting to me, but the longer I wore it, the worst it looked. I could almost tell after a few minutes of having it on, it was alresdy breaking down on my skin. Very disappointed. I wish it would have worked. * I was really excited to try this foundation as I have heard a makeup artist I watch on youtube obsess over it for years.

105,wyn beauty,featuring you hydrating skin enhancing tint spf 30,pimprod2044322,2622290," * The best skin tint in the game!! It is literally magic in a tennis ball. I have purchased several bottles since the launch last April. The match is so pretty and clean. It's very hydrating and not heavy. 10000000000/10!! * I love how lightweight and buildable the coverage is. If you're darker definitley shade match in store bc i was in between shades but found the perfect shade * As someone who falls into the light tone range but as olive undertones it's sometimes hard finding a shade that matches me, especially with skin tints or tinted moisturizers . I have my go to full coverage foundation but wanted something a bit lighter to wear on casual days with spf. I was hesitant about the radiant natural finish because I have oily skin but after wearing trying the shade 'More' i think ive found a new go to skin tint! It wears beautifully (and even helped a little with some dry patches im
experiencing from a breakout) and the color matches me perfectly! I would say its more of a natural finish (radiant makes me think dewy/glowy which is beautiful but not for my skin). Thank you Serena for this product, its a win! * I wore this at a fancy brunch event. The ladies kept talking about how flawless my skin looked, lol! It didn't rub off on my friends when i hugged them. It also maybe that i ised primer before & after.. but i love this glow! Natural * I think this is the first skin tint I've used that is a true neutral! It's a 'wyn' for sure. You do have to work quick because the formula dries fast. The color match was a bit lighter but that's not an issue with the product, but Ulta's website. * I was hoping tontey out a more lightweight formula but this isnt it for me. The smell is nice bur once on my skin its very blotchy looking. When working it in it just feels greasy. Not great if you have acne prone skin. Cute packaging * I absolutely love this. It goes in light and then oxidizes. It matches my skin shade perfecly and gives good coverage but is buildable."
106,hourglass,ambient soft glow foundation,pimprod2033509,2599657," * I love that this foundation does NOT oxidize on my skin! Feels super lightweight and doesn't even look like I have a full face of foundation when I wear it. Will definitely be getting again once I run out! * Since discovering, this has quickly become my go-to favorite foundation! It does indeed blur my skin's imperfections and gives a radient, beautiful glow to my skin without looking glittery. It blends quite easily and I can get pretty good coverage with just a single pump/ layer without it looking cakey. And to top everything rlse off, it really does last ALL day without fading, transferring or melting. I would highly recommend :) 
For reference, I am 45 yo, with rosacea, fine lines, fairly balanced skin (oily/dry), large pores and ice pick acne scars. * I honestly picked this up on accident. I meant to grab the skin tint but grabbed the foundation instead. BUT after using it, I'm in love with it! It's perfect for dry, sensitive skin and has medium coverage. I'd recommend if you don't have acne prone or oily skin :) Wish I would have found this during winter * Hourglass has fabulous makeup products. I just love the way they make my skin feel and look with the quality ingredients infused in them. This illusion luminous glow foundation is great. I like that it doesn't dry out my skin and it gives me a nice glow. This was gifted by hourglass cosmetics. * This foundation is amazing! It is not heavy and has good coverage. I wear a mask at work and do not break out with this foundation and I have with other types of foundation. I would highly recommended this foundation! * I'm 50+ with combo oily but dehydrated skin and I love this foundation. The shade match is decent considering they don't have the olive undertone my skin needs. The coverage is great but it does eventually sink in my smile lines throughout the day, which 99% of foundations do to me. I just use less in that area and pat a cotton swab along my smile lines, problem alleviated. * I have tried many foundations over the years, this and estee doublr wear will always be my top foundations. The coverage is amazing, it blurs my texture and pores, lasts all day, doesnt seperate or enhance dryness. I have very very dry skin with bad roscea and other skin issues and it looks beautiful even on my bad skin days and causes me no irritation. Plus shade 3 is perfect for me."

My daughter found this for me and so far i absolutely love it. The color match is perfect.  It goes on so soft and smooth and there is not a weird or strong smell. * Good coverage. * The first time gave me a rash so I waited a couple of months to make sure it was this and I tried it again and gave a red bumps all over my face. I'm not the only one. There's a lot of bad reviews w the same effect. * Excellent powder foundation for older women.  I don't know why my color doesn't seem to be available anymore though.  What's going on with the limited shade offerings?  Fenty still has all 50 shades on their website! * Ive been using this powder in shade 150 since it came out. All of a sudden theres no lighter shades? Not even one around the color ive been using. I've probably went through 10 of these compacts, and am beyond disappointed. Def gives me the ick for the brand!! * Perfect match for my skin tone. * I did the color match online and they matched me with a Shane that is not even available anymore. At the store I matched with 210 and the consultant said they are not going to carry that shade anymore. why would this supposedly inclusive brand cut all these different shades from their lineup? Now I guess I have to find another brand to buy powder from."

The moisture it provides gives your look a facial glow and a wonderful fresh feel. I will definitely purchase this product again! * This foundation is amazing!! It has a beautiful finish on my skin.

It has a beautiful finish on my skin. It pairs well with my primer and moisturizer, which is a plus. I wish it came in a bigger bottle, but the quality of the product makes up for it. * I have combo skin; my T-zone is an oil slick, there are random patches of extremely dry skin, and the rest is normal.

T-zone: foundation separates and looks really bad. No powder or application technique can fix it.

Random dry patches: foundation cakes up, but not terribly. It would be passable by the ""3 feet"" rule.

Normal skin: foundation is BEAUTIFUL, which sucks, because how many people actually have completely normal skin? The negative reviews are so hot + cold because this foundation wasn't formulated for a specific skin type outside of ""normal"".

The overall pros: foundation blends seamlessly and the shade match is excellent. It has a beatiful, dewy-satin finish, and cream products lay really nicely on top of it. I rebought this three times because the majory of my skin was ""normal"" and it looked so nice, I could pretend my T-zone wasnt a disaster lol. It also wore well in the sun and hot environments for a few hours, and never oxidized on me.

The cons: aside from the dry/oily problems, there is something in this foundation that made my face itch like CRAZY. It wasnt until I ran out and bought a drugstore brand on the fly, that I realized it was this foundation. After about 4-6 hours on my face, it would itch unbearably. Additionally, there is no setting powder or technique that could keep this foundation from transferring. If you rub your face at all, sweat, or get liquid on it while wearing it, you're cooked.

This was a book but I hope it was thorough enough to help someone who might be deciding if this foundation would be right for them! * Doesn't look cakey on the skin, goes on really nicely, if you're on the fence about buying it. Buy it you won't regret it * I love this foundation- I've been using it for about 6 months now and ive repurchased it multiple times. I'm an incredibly pale person and this foundation has had the best color match I've ever been able to find and I've tried a wide variety of brands. * Great coverage and having hyaluronic acid is great because it helps to keep my skin look good and it doesn't look cakey on me!!!"

I wear the lightest shade ivory, it doesn't oxidize or turn orange. Great foundation. * The coverage is okay but there is no moisturizer or radiance. It makes my skin very dry and cakey. * This product has nice light coverage.  I mix 2 colors to achieve my perfect match, and I apply with a brush in a circular fashion. I do not have the problem of it settling into lines.  It is the absolute best for sun protection!  I might cry if it were discontinued. * This is my favorite makeup, not only does it have 50 SPF but it lasts all day while helping my skin!  The price is TERRIFIC I only wish my local Ulta store would carry it!! * I don't mind sunscreen smell much, but this was strong unpleasant sunscreen smell, almost to bug spray smell level. Hard nope. Seemed okay otherwise for a thinner more skincare oriented foundation. * I used the Ulta website to find the shade I needed but it was too yellow. * Love! If this was $40 i would pay $40 for it!

I have fairly good skin with some hyperpigmentation which is my only concern. This product gives a satin finish that smooths out your skin and somehow still manages to keep your skin looking like skin. I wish there were more shades for olive undertones but overall the product works on different tones because of the type of coverage it offers. love it * I have tried a LOT of foundations--high end, online only brands, etc. This is my favorite.  It feels like nothing on the skin.  It has no smell and covers better than some heavier foundations.  Even when only using a small amount, it is automatically medium coverage but looks natural while making skin even.  It only takes a small amount, so the price is justified (in my book anyway) since it  seems to last longer than other foundations as I only use one pump for my whole face usually.  Totally worth it! * wanted to splurge on this but it is just too runny. * This is my favorite foundation and thats saying a lot as ive tried pretty much every one out there. The coverage is way better than the other water fresh foundation which had none at all, and its leaves the most beautiful, natural finish. My only complaint is that the bottle goes much quicker than other foundations but its so good that I'm going to buy it anyway. * Shocked at how bad it is for the price and being Chanel. Consistency and coverage sucks, smells weird, doesnt blend, brush is crap. Just all around bad. * This is probably the best every day product ive ever used. It makes me feel like ME. The consistency is super lightweight. It doesnt feel like I have makeup on. * I love how smooth it goes on and how natural it looks. covers imperfections without looking heavy."

My go to foundation from now on! * Definitely worth the buy my only con so far is that comes off a little too easy with regular mundane task like a little runny or water from eyes or too long of contact with anything may cause it to come off some but then again I might need better setting soap that's why i gave it a 4 star * i really really love this foundation i just wish it came in a bigger bottle! this little thing wont lash me very long, but very good foundation!! * I only use this product when it really warms up as it's truly mattifying. The problem is that it's very viscous so you don't need to use too much bc it can look cakey almost instantly. It's also disappointing to see they've shrunk the package to a not even full tiny container and kept the price the same. I think I'll pass on this from now on. * I have combination skin with dry spots by my mouth and oily spots by my t-zone. While it applied fine, after a few hours I could see it starting to separate. If you have normal skin are trying to cover dark spots I would give this a try as it's full coverage but if you have any kind of texture stay away. It sinks into creases and makes acne look worse than a bare face. * After reading reviews about the shades oxidizing, i decided to pair this with LA girls blue color corrector, because i have a light olive skin tone.

Color matched perfect and the application feels more like foundation w/ light coverage. I apply it with a beauty blender, finish with Elf hi-Def setting powder and I'm out the door! Try it for yourself :) * For a long time, instead of using foundation I used either Shape Tape or Born This Way where I need it most and would just blend it out onto my moisturizer.  This summer I developed some really bad sunspots and no matter how much corrector/concealer I'd use, my skin would look grey where the sun spots were.  One day, I tried this because I had gotten a sample and omg it has saved me!  I finally felt comfortable going out again without thinking everyone was staring at me.  The weird part was, it wasn't as heavy or full coverage as my concealer but worked 100x better.  Well, I'm finally at the end of that little tube and also, I now need a lighter color, so here I am.  

This CC cream is better than any other I've tried, it somehow has great coverage but looks incredibly soft and natural.  I'm also able to use it where I need it without seeing lines of demarcation.  This is most definitely an unsung hero and I'm baffled as to how it doesn't have a better rating. * I came in today looking for the tarte BB cream, but saw the cloud CC cream and went with it instead.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NEVER EVER discontinue or reformulate. I am a customer for life and this foundation has changed my life. * very skin like finish! no fuss foundation. * This is an undetectable foundation on my mature, dry skin, though it can build easily for extra coverage. I will just add additional drops on those darker spots, which still peek through but look more homogenous. But coverage is not my main concern, so this winner maintains the slightly dewy glow over a well -prepped skin base, still looking un made-up by the end of the day. Also, goes over mineral sunscreen flawlessly. IMO it is on par with Haus Labs, Nars Radiant LIght, MUF reboot; my other favs. I am trying another shade, though am happy with Katey, the match I found via the skin models- so that's my recommendation for finding your shade, rather than the description. It is on sale, so... TRY IT! * I'm assuming this foundation is on clearance because of quality issues… I received my order and the formula is completely separated and cannot be mixed back together to a good consistency. * I was so surprised when i first used it, my skin looked like skin. I like a lightweight natiral finish and this gives me exactly that! It also stays on all day/night, only thing is that it oxidizes a little bit but not wnything drastic. Has been my go-to foundation for over a year already! * good match for hard shade (fair/light olive) and good for sensitive/acne prone/scar/texture skin. decent coverage but feels light and natural. but doesnt really set (makeup smudges on my cat) & taking the top off pulls the entire pump out sometimes * I have used this foundation for a few years and it's never let me down. I fluctuate between a range of their lighter, cool toned shades depending on the time of year. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. A few things I've learned along the way: 

*A thin base layer will cover most spots and uneven tones. If you need more coverage, then spot treat with a little more foundation.
*It pairs beautifully on top of Nudestix tinted sunscreen.
*Applies well with brushes or sponges, but better with your fingers.
*A stippling, dabbing motion is the best method to apply the thin layers.

I'm 41, and I receive many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation, and I feel like I look more youthful with this on. I will definitely continue to repurchase!"
119,bareminerals,original pure serum radiant natural liquid foundation mineral spf 20,pimprod2040524,2611614," * I use alot of bareMinerals products and normally love them but this product, not so good. The foundation myst be shake very well before applying otherwise it's an oily mess. The foundation feels very smooth and light on the skin and the finish is more natural. The main problem I found was that within an hour, the foundation was breaking down, settling in my fine lines and my skin started feeling greasy. Before applying the foundation, my skin is fully prepped- washed, moisturizer, and primer. After the foundation was applied, setting powder and setting spray applied. I tried different primers, applying techniques and different setting sprays with the same outcome. * This appears to be the new replacement of the BarePro Performanceware Liquid Foundation, but this is so much worse. Horrible coverage, runny, watery, and just a mess. Definitely regret this purchase. * Thank you! * Put some foundation on clean forehead and had to remove it immediately. Greasy thin liquid. Yuck! Will return asap! * This fills in lines well. Soft and velvety. Good coverage. * The foundations separates really easily. If it sits for more than a day, it will be split and pumps out oily liquid. It looks ok on, but isn't remarkable. I have found even with a light hand and a small amount, it looks kind of heavy. That may be because when it separates, it's really hard to get it to mix again so it either pumps out runny liquid or thick.

I understand everyone has different skn types, but for my dry skin this makeup goes on flawless without dry patches like most foundations do on my skin. I can literally wear this all day without a touchup, plus I get comstant compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation. I am obsessed! * should be $5 at the drugstore. borrowed from a friend because i lost mine and i can't believe she paid that much, design looks cheap also. not to mention a terrible company * I'm honestly surprised this foundation only has 2.7 stars. It's my second time buying it and I absolutely love it! It has great coverage, keeps my skin from looking too shiny, and leaves it looking smooth and flawless—not cakey or cracked. I always get compliments on my skin when I wear it. I really don't understand the low ratings—maybe people are expecting that fake, overly filtered look? This product is excellent! * I understand that darker shades are less likely to sell therefore putting them on sale might help but it is disheartening seeing a sale but only a select few shades * Horrible company and quality * Better off using peanut butter * Everything about this sucks.

F7 and lower a little pink, which I should have bought to ""help"" my other medium shade brands at home which are, like this brand, ORANGE. The only one I've found where medium shades are not orange is elizabeth arden. Unfortunately it's not cruelty free, so I'm sticking with merle norman (only one store in the county). * I actually really like this foundation. I use a primer as I'm 41 years old and liquid foundation seems to settle weird on my skin. this went on smooth, had light but buoldable coverage and didn't make my skin feel dry or greasy. the only down fall is this stuff transfers onto everything. I cant rest my hand, clothes,  etc on my face or else I am covered in the foundation. I even use an expensive setting spray and still see transfer. bummed bc I liked everything else about the product. * this is really good it blends really good and i never knew it had a pump cuz i thought u just twist it but u just pop it up but i wish it had more in it and it doesn't really have a lot of coverage ok but it matches my skin so much * I dont usually wear foundation so I dont have much to compare this to, but its pretty nice. it blends very easily, its about sheer-medium coverage, and the coverage lasts throughout the day. its not as glowy as i thought it was though, but it doesnt feel drying. it did pill and roll around my temples and chin though, not sure why. the color is slightly off; i got f2 but i probably shouldve gotten f0.5, because its slightly yellow and dark on me, so i just mix it with my concealer. * when I saw this product i was like wow should I get it and i am lad I did . Its so silky goes on skin like nothing . I am really glad I tried this product ."

It's a great value and applies easily with a sponge, brush, or fingers. Also, I have super dry skin in the winter, and it doesn't flake! * I have used this product since i was 16. Its got amazing coverage, and when i had acne it didn't accentuate it one bit. Now that Im in my mid 20s i still reach for it, it doesnt feel heavy and it lasts me all day. It has to do with technique too, on any foundation tbh, I prefer to build and blend until I get it just right. I love the applicator too. * I started using this foundation in 2022 and havent used a different once since! With acne (cystic) it easily applies and as long as you dont touch your face too much it lasts for hours! This product seriously changed my life. (I pair it with the Glow Watermelon moisturizer as a primer/base) . * When i applied it looked a little too pink for me, by the end of the day it got very cake-y and had gone very orange. I loved the price and texture at first but I think I will be stickinh with my tarte for now. * I got the white one to do goth/halloween makeup and it smelled like i shouldnt have put it on my face due to the awful chemical smell, was hard to blend it was overall terrible, I've used halloween face paint that looked better than this. * Been using this for years literally like 5 years ive tried other foundation but this is the best for me, im oily skin and this one is very thin light on skin but full coverage! Not like other foundation thats thick and heavy on skin. Little goes along the way! Sad that i can only buy this online, i dont like their new foundation lol.

I feel like I have odd coloring and have a very hard time finding foundations that match but this has been great. It provides that ""clean girl"" look but can also go into a full beat. I think the advisement/examples for the colors are way off. If I hadn't been in store for my purchase my color match would have been wildly incorrect. And I'd use a brush for application and avoid the sponge provided. I honestly might go down a shade for the winter but this will be a great summer color! Would def buy again! * I had high hopes for this powder I use alot of Juvias stuff. I'm Native/Mexican and tan quickly in the summer so I was looking for summer shades as opposed to my winter shades but this stuff turned orange so fast on me it also felt like baby powder. I don't have flakey skin and this made me look like I had flakes. I will be returning it. I used a dense brush on bare dry skin maybe it would work another way but not like this on me. * I rather use fit me then this.. and for the price it also was really orange and just a no for me * There is so much fallout and zero coverage and it feels even drier than a typical foundation powder. I fully regret buying this, especially considering how expensive it is for a drugstore powder. * this is the first brand that has a shade that matches my skin tone perfectly. i used it in store and outside to see how it looked in different lighting even in my car the color matched really well and it has a blurring effect. i noticed it does cling to dry spots on my face but thats something i've noticed pretty much all powder foundations do. i think for the price this is a great quality foundation so far * Great coverage, medium to buildable
Light weight 
Non drying 
Great for eczema skin, wont be too drying * The color was completely off and didn't match my skin tone at all. The formula is super thick, felt heavy on my skin, and made my pores look huge! It was uncomfortable to wear and left my skin looking worse than before. Definitely not for me."

What I love most is its versatility—whether I'm doing a full glam look or wearing it alone, it delivers flawless, lightweight coverage without feeling heavy. Black Opal continues to be a staple in my beauty routine, and this concealer is an absolute must-have! * This product provides great coverage,long wear,user friendly and there is a shade for all skin colors and types. Thank you Black Opal. * Product is so easy to blend out. Has so much pigment and is good for any skin tones. Definitely inclusive * Creamy and smooth it glides right on. Blends very well also very good pigment. My usual brand was out of my shade so I decided to try different brand and I'm not disappointed to say the least 😊 * Goes on smooth and seamless. * I rarely use other foundations.

It is heavily fragranced and overall really thick
It would be amazing if didn't smell and wasn't so warm toned it just looked orangey on me even though I've tried other products of theirs without an issue. Keep in mind I'm really, really pale. * It has a nice scent, medium coverage, and last all day! * I bought this product about 2 shades to light, however I mix it with come bronze drops and it's perfect. this is great for a full coverage dewy look. my only downfall is the smell, it's a super strong tropical type smell, it may not be the best for extremely sensitive skin * I went in store to get color matched and out of the 3 foundations that I tried I knew this was the one for me! It matches my skin tone perfectly and it goes on smoothly so it doesn't even look like I have makeup on! If i could give it 10 stars I would because so far this is the only foundation that I've found that actually works for me! * I really enjoy this foundation. I don't know what it is but I get compliments about my makeup when I wear it. I don't feel like it's too radient but it's just enough. I love the fragrance of the foundation, it's just a beautiful scent. When I wear this foundation it gives effort even if there wasn't any. * Juvia's Place products are great! Mombasa is the perfect shade for me. It looks just like my skin. Just remember a little of this foundation goes a long way. This is my favorite foundation.  I'll continue to buy it. * This is one of the most beautiful foundations ive ever used uppon first application, so dewy and smoothing its insane. The problem is as soon as I applied any product over it, it immediately separated. I tried different primers, no primers, different powders, different concealers and it all just turned so bad I needed to wash my face and re do my makeup. Its so sad because its so pretty and smells amazing. Maybe it will work better with their own products but it was just disappointing.

For the price I was willing to try it and am glad I did. This offers great coverage and I use for everyday wear.  I do use the makeup forever for special occasions but will continue to purchase this powder for every day work wear. * I love powder foundation & this one really surprised me. It has great coverage, almost like a concealer & is soft. Don't use the puff that comes with it, use a compact powder sponge. * I've bought multiple. Never mind the cheap price, it works on my oily skin. When applied right and correct, it's not cakey, and doesn't patch up. It lasts all day and is so good for oil control. I really like it. * Reading thru the reviews of this, I purchased it. Unfortunately it was a disappointment. Returned. * Wanted to love this because for the most part this brand is great- i dont even have dry skin and this goes on so patchy! * Its a good powder besides it having a smell that i cant stand and sometimes it feels quite cakey."

It provides full coverage but doesn't feel heavy on the skin. I would buy over and over again. * I have been wanting to try this foundation for a while,  as I love some of the other Milani products, but one of the drawbacks is it can only be purchased online. I finally ordered it and it's ok. I took a quiz to see which color I should order since I've never ordered it before. Again it's only available online, so I can't go test the shades in the store. I am usually an ivory shade in other brands so I got the 220 creamy natural. When it came in, my first reaction was ""oh no"" my fear of ordering the wrong shade came true as the foundation looked really dark and orange. Since I already had it, I decided to test it anyway knowing full well it would not match, but it sort of did end up matching. The dark orange color was just like a film and it was lighter underneath and it blends really well. It feels really lightweight and breathable. It almost feels like you aren't even wearing make up, which makes sense since I found it to be very light coverage. I was hoping for medium to full coverage, but it just evened my skin out like a BB cream would do. I would still recommend it for the price, but wouldn't compare it to the KVD as that's how it was promoted to me. * I took the shade match quiz, the shade was way too light and when applied looks cakey and clings to dry patches. * I got this foundation in the lightest shade and its still too dark and orange. It cakes extremely bad even with two lifht layers. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone! * The cream-to-powder formula is fantastic! I use it alone (no concealer, highlighter, bronzer, blush) and it works great to cover up my acne scars and even out my complexion. However, I have noticed that it breaks me out really badly. I wish there was a clean formula for this type of product. * Right texture for me * 54 with dry skin. I was concerned about this product bc I normal stick to liquid foundation. I have tried almost every one out there but I was extremely surprised by this foundation! It was easily buildiable with smooth application. I was concerned at 1st the color match was a bit darker (245 warm beige) but after concealer & some pressed powder I had the most beautiful sun-kissed glow! For reference I love Nars in Santa-fe, Clinique  CN 40 cream chamois, Colourpop light 55N. I don't really see any skin type having an issue with this product. It was easy to apply, didn't feel heavy or cakey, never felt oily or dry, just smooth & silky. Highly recommend. No issues using other brand products with this foundation. I saw some saying it moves along or was patchy, follow the directions & build it. This is a cream to powder product so it will apply a bit different.  Will repurchase"

I like trying new/different products every once in awhile. I really tried to like this foundation… I tried it out 3 different times. Applying with a foundation brush, then the next time damp beauty blender, then I tried applying with a brush followed by a damp beauty blender… it is horrible. It smells chemically, and it literally looks like paint on my face. I dont know how else to describe it. Not to mention if you go more than a day or two without using it seperates and looks funky. I understand products tend to do that over time but it just doesnt look right, or sit right/look good on the face. And the few times I did wear it, it was seperating and sliding off my face within 3-4 hours. And that is with me prepping my skin, using primer and setting spray. 0/10 recommend!! * This product is the best look on me I've used in years. Love it * I love this foundation! I can wear it through a whole night of performances and have no issues. It works super well with the revolution transparent setting powder, and revolution setting spray. Bronzer powder and contour blend out really well on top, even after setting powder. I don't notice any creasing after using the setting powder. I use ELF grip primer underneath, and ELF camo concealer, both products work very well with this foundation. * I tried this because i had used some of their eyeshadows that worked well for me.   If you have skin that tends to be oily this is probably not a good product for you. * I love this foundation so much.  I love the way it stays on my skin through the day as I work.

I just use tarte shape tape under my eyes and around my nose/chin for redness. But I wanted a little something just to enhance my skin. Everything either has sunscreen in it which I do not want or looks like like I put highlighter all over my face. This does not have any shimmer or glitter like the CT Hollywood filter. This provides minimal coverage but gives your skin a glow. You can always spot conceal if you have a blemish and this goes nicely on top. I can also see using this under or on top of higher coverage foundation for a dewy look. If you have extremely oily skin I do not think it would work but for normal to dry its beautiful. The thing I can compare it to most is milk makeups skin tint, but that clings to dry patches and separates. This does not, its perfect! * I love this brand. * Love this product! So glowy! I wear this instead of foundation and it works perfectly! * I am returning this product. I gave it a try but it is sooo greasy and I usually like a more glowy foundation. Less coverage than a bb cream lol and needs soooo much powder to keep it on but stays kinda sticky. I hate it lol * Ive been using this for about a year and a half now, and i love it!!! 

I switched when I found out my E.L.F glow was making me break out. Ive had zero problems since then! 

Im not a foundation or full coverage girlie so putting ny consealer ontop of this really does give me the full face make up look, without feeling sooooo heavy. * Juvia skin booster foundation is sheer and gives a nice glow to skin. I'm fair and purchased number 9 to get a little color. I also like the applicator allowing easy use. Best to dab on and blend with fingers. * First off…. The people reviewing this and getting upset about the coverage is ridiculous. Its not a foundation so chill. Its supposed to be sheer. 
As far as the actual product…. If you can get it to behave properly then its beautiful. Unfortunately it does not play well with other products and the applicator leaves streaks that are hard to blend out. I will be returning this for the difficulty purposes only. Almost great!"

I wanted to really like it but it didn't work for me * I love this foundation, its like your own skin but better. * At this price I'm pretty disappointed. Color match was great and does not oxidize, but that's where the pros ended for me. Definitely not full coverage, didn't blend well and shifts/splotchy. If you're an oilslick like me… this is a total waste. Maybe good for dryer skin? Going back to Dior at this price point and won't be purchasing this one again. * This foundation brought out texture and wrinkles I have never seen before. It is not very blend-able, as it takes a lot of manipulation to look somewhat acceptable. This product is very drying and I have oily skin. Not to mention it does not adhere to the skin, it slips and sides off your face throughout the day leaving you patchy. * I finally found my holy grail foundation, I didn't even buy it at Ulta but that's how much I loved it to write a review. It feels like I'm wearing nothing, it matches my skin perfectly which has been a nightmare for years trying to find a good match. * This coverage is a lot more sheer and dewy than I had anticipated. This would be a beautiful foundation for someone with dry, mature skin since it does not crease. The colors are not accurate either. I suggest ordering one to two shades darker. * I need to keep looking. I have a full bottle that I hope to find someone that it works for."

143,maybelline,instant age rewind eraser treatment foundation,pimprod2043641,2620458," * I'm 50 and have used foundations at every price point from drugstore to luxury. This is my favorite (I'm buying my second bottle) because it doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything on my skin. It covers well without being heavy or cakey. I use it as my concealer as well. I would prefer pump packaging because with the twist-up you can't gauge how much you're dispensing, but I can get past that. Great, unsung foundation! * Great job on covering the blemishes. * I am picky about color shades and there is Many colors to choose from * It worked like a greasy highlighter on my face, highlighted flaws I didn't know i had. Although I like the sheer and shimmery tint I didn't find it useful enough to keep it. * I love how it goes on. Looks great on my skin. * As a pale girl I NEVER can find foundation that's fair enough.  Not only is this a shade match, but the wear is smooth and pretty- and it's hard to mess up the application.  Sponge/Brush/Fingers.  Also primer/no primer the product goes on well. * Very very easy for applying on skin  love this product"

It feels so nourishing and applies so evenly. It's light yet gives a good medium coverage. A great summertime weight. Not heavy but yet just enough color. Love it. Buy it. Give it a try. I think you'll like it. * This foundation is so perfect for me. It blends perfectly into my skin. It's so easy to apply. I just dab it on with a beauty sponge and I'm done in minutes! 
I love it ❤️ * I'm not sure why my skin reacts to foundation so terribly, but even the luxury brands make me look a little off. I know my undertone and have been able to pinpoint my exact color profile, so it's not that. Foundation usually sits on top of my face, amplifies my fine lines, and makes me look like a hot mess. Age Perfect Tinted Balm is the only foundation that makes me look better, and I wish I knew about it sooner. It's my favorite! * I have what the skincare industry refers to as ""mature ""skin. I am a make junkie and I had many foundations from drugstores and major department stores but as I got older they all made me look cake and settled into lines. I stumbled on this product and I love it. It's my skin only better. It lasts almost all day on my  combination oily dry skin. It is a wonderful product with light medium coverage for mature skin. Will definitely buy again * I've used 3 pots of this now and I'm still somehow surprised by how nice it is. The formula feels like it won't cover much, but it softens the appearance of/seems to fill and even out pores, scars, wrinkles, or any textures--I often get compliments on how smooth my skin looks when I use this. I've gone back and forth between two colors because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the color match is a little difficult. All in all, I keep trying new foundations just to come back to this one and be impressed by it. * I'm a light-medium skin tone that leans towards cool. I got started on this because an influencer raved about it a few yrs. ago. I decided to try it and couldn't had been more thrilled. I use shade fair 20 for reference. In the pot it looks more like a peach shade. It glides on effortlessly and melts into my skin. My dry/mature skin looks healthy. I'm sure I will get tired of this foundation, but for the last 3 yrs. I've been pleased. Only time will tell. * I was very skeptical to try this and was shocked. It is so good. 47 year old combo skin, apply with real techniques dense brush and its better than high end. How is this not more popular?"

I actually found it quite drying. I love HG products and am so glad Ulta is carrying them. I hope they'll carry the newer HG skin tint so I can try that one. * Im 55 and my skin is very dry, this product is moisturizing and never settles in my pores , an excellent alternative to foundation which just sat on my skin, this tinted moisturizer does not do that. I would highly recommend this product- * I have never had so many compliments about my skin since using this tinted moisturizer! It may not be for anyone needing full coverage makeup but someone looking for a glow and slight coverage! * It was very hard to find something for my aging skin that is full coverage, but doesn't settle into lines and look caked on. this was recommended in store and I absolutely love it! I apply with a beauty blender and use shape tape concealer with a tiny bit of setting powder. Really makes a difference being hyaluronic and any pictures while wearing come out great. A must in my drawer. * I wanted to like this. I have dry skin and some creepiness at 52. This made all of that worse.

It's very thick and kinda hard to blend out even with moisturizer and primer. 
I had to return this and buy the Too Faced brand hydrating liquid foundation. * Several comments said this was medium to full coverage which made me want to try it and it is not. There is absolutely no coverage at all. If anything it's just a glorified moisturizer so I'm thinking those other comments were for a different product. * Absolutely one of my favorite foundation. I love how it leaves my skin glowing and hydrated!"
146,jane iredale,refillable compact,pimprod2031651,2595249," * Tried to purchase this compact in the 21 Days of Beauty promotional, but couldn't add it to my cart, was it sold out?  Imagine my surprise the following day when it was available again at full price. Bait and switch advertising...not cool. * The discontinued gold compact was perfectly thin and light weight, making it easy to carry everyday. Also great for touch-ups when mineral foundation SPF is needed out in the sun! The closing latch wasn't super secure but I never had a problem with it opening in my purse. The new design is thick and super heavy. It's beautiful to sit on a counter, but useless weight for travel or carried in a shoulder bag. So sad I never odered backs up of the slim gold-tone compact! * I was surprised how expensive this compact is. But I have had so many contacts break and then I get crumbled pressed powder. This one looks like it will hold up well. I will let you know the first time I drop it-Yikes! * Very happy with this new compact. My JI mineral foundation stores securely,  the compact opens easily and now has a mirror. Yay! * I am a loyal Jane Iredale brand user. In fact, I have been using their products for over 20 years. The Jane Iredale line was recommended to me by the surgeon who did facial reconstruction after skin cancer surgery. 

Although I love their products, I have always been ""ehh"" about their packaging....until now! Thanks for finally giving up the gaudy gold (sorry, Jane Iredale) and going with this new, modern and aesthetically pleasing line of packaging. Since I have several of the old gold compacts, including the gold metals ones, I ordered one of the new compacts to see how I would like it. After receiving the new compact, I cannot wait to replace ALL my older versions! 

One more suggestion... in your future development, please consider making your eye shadows available in refills. I love the idea of being kinder to our planet and saving on the excess packaging. I do not mind paying separately for the cases if I know if is making a smaller, greener impact for future generations. =)

One final note of thanks to Ulta...I have been begging my local store to start carrying Jane Iredale. I am glad to see that you are at least finally carrying this amazing, clean line of makeup online! * I bought this on sale and I'm glad I did. It just makes it nice to put your foundation in. For the price of the foundation, it's a shame you have to purchase compact separately. * This packaging is overpriced and by default should be included with the powder. Waste of money."

Thats where this product shines! It's very hydrating and lightweight so it looks like radiant skin! * I actually love this foundation bc i have blemish free skin and us it to even out hyperpigmentation. The issue is the pump… it does not pull product well after tube is no longer full and it doesn't come off. So its just wasted product. * Of course it doesn't fully cover blemishes, its not full coverage. I buy this again & again & pair it with concealer for under eyes / blemishes , & blush. Its so smooth, never breaks out my acne prone skin. I love it so much!! * Honestly I hate foundation, I have super sensitive skin and anything can break me out easily. This foundation is SO NICE!! It is more like a skin tint than a foundation, which I prefer if I do ever wear it, the smell is relaxing (if you're not an essential oil person I wouldn't recommend, the lavender is pretty strong), and it doesn't feel like anything is on. For my Florida girls this stuff is a great quick fix for the hot and humid days!! * I have super sensitive, rosacea-prone skin & my eyes are really easily irritated by makeup (ocular rosace) that started a few years ago - suddenly I couldn't wear my favorite makeup without breaking out, & my eyes burning, bright red. I searched & finally found a brand specifically for rosacea-prone skin! So happy to be able to wear makeup again! Over the last year or so the formula clearly changed - I couldn't find a color match & then my eyes started to  burn again. Back to the search - finally found this - I love this foundation & the whole product line! It's light & looks great - as others have said, I look like myself, only better! It doesn't settle in my lines or pores, doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It does feel a bit oily / has a bit of shine. Also, Nude 3 is a perfect color match for me when it goes on, but it does darken a bit across the day so I'm going to try 2.5 & save 3 for the summer. Otherwise, highly recommend!! * I bought this foundation and love it.  I'm 47 years old with dry and pigmented skin from aging and I like light coverage products due to aging skin look more natural than full coverage foundation.  Very moisturizing.  I still set with loose powder and yes would buy this as long as nudestix still made this. * I got this product in shades light3 it a good tinted moisturizer with light to medium at most.  Great for dry skin.  Love this product."

149,uoma beauty,say what?! foundation,pimprod2033346,2593663," * I was so impressed with the color matching. This matched perfectly. Unfortunately, it was pretty watery. After a lot of shaking, it seemed to dispense properly, but the formula is pretty thick. It dries almost instantly and makes blending difficult. I also felt that it emphasized fine lines and wrinkles on my very dry skin. * overall the wear of the foundation wasn't bad, but my skin was red and inflamed when I took it off and I don't typically have sensitive skin and this was the only thing different in my routine * I like this brand and what little of this foundation I put on my face went on smooth and dried well. but it smelled so awful I couldn't use it! I didn't see reviews that mentioned the smell so I'm wondering if I got an old/bad batch…which would also be concerning. Disappointed but returning this * I have a hard time finding foundation due to an olive undertone, with silver being a better jewelry color for me. I purchased the Fair Lady T1N and this just.. it's awesome. It does dry down fast and blending becomes near impossible after, but with my combo skin, this is wonderful. I live in Maine and this foundation doesnt budge in the winter or the summer. One thing I will say is that if you have dry skin, this foundation won't be user-friendly. I typically have oil on my nose and forehead, with a dry chin. I lightly exfoliate my face, apply toner, then follow it up by a light non-cream moisturizer, and that solves the problem. * I was hoping this product would perform close to the Becca foundation that you can no longer get.
It's OK but not a go to foundation. It's more watery in my opinion and coverage has to be worked on quite a bit. 
I am sorry, but for me it's not what I was hoping for. * I dont teally wear foundation but gor aome reaaon wanted to try  this one and it was on sale . I am SO happy with it ! It wasnt heavy and it didnt cake up !  I am beyond happy * I LOVE this, I currently have 9 foundations(yes I counted) that I rotate through and I wish I found this sooner. I love how it lays on my face and makes my 42 year old skin look amazing. I will say that it will pill if you do not let your primer set."
150,j.cat beauty,aquasurance compact foundation,pimprod2000221,2550026," * This is my favorite powder foundation formula and has been for years - goes on so smoothly and is buildable. The last few compacts I've bought have cracked from barely any use. I had to dump the powder into a different container and use it that way. * so I do a full face every day. every once in a while I'll ""cheat"" and use this product to save time. it works sooo well. I use a light shade which I chose by pretty much matching my neck/highlight areas and use it mainly in my T zone. highlighting under eyes, forehead between brows chin and then I also add it along my jawline. then I go about my routine as normal but without the need for foundation highlight and baking. saves so much time! it builds well and has amazing coverage. it lasts all day. I have mature skin and hate when things settle into fine lines and wrinkles and I do not have that problem with this. it actually makes my skin appear younger compared to my full face routine with baking etc. I know I hav to find a new foundation to help avoid it but who has the time lol anyway... YES. this product is one I want to hoard in case it ever goes away. it's amazing. I use it with a compact dense brush. 

only downside is that I broke 2... but it's because I throw it in my purse and I know that's not ideal and on me for being careless. but if it's getting tossed around, be aware the powder may break. * This is a must have in my kit! I use it to lightly set my foundation and it transforms my face! I have also used it as a powder foundation for summer days and it is flawless! * This is the best powder foundation i have ever tried, i reach for this one over my high end one. Its my go to during the summer months. * Medium to full coverage. I like to carry it in my bag for touch ups because it covers the redness around the nose, i can cover up some my blemishes that peak out after wearing makeup all day etc * I use the shade Natural and I absolutely love this powder. i've used mine all the way to the pan and just restocked a new one. Literally the most beautiful blurring coverage, doesn't feel cakey or drying and my skin looks flawless. Great for on the go and quick touch ups. I usually hate the feeling of wearing heavy foundations and powders so once I found this it was over. Super breathable and comfortable and evens out my skin tone in a couple quick pass overs. I love this product. * Medium to high coverage, smoothing, non-comedogenic. Its a bit hard to shade match. I use Soft Tan in this powder and Nars Valencia, Lisa Eldridge 19, Estee Lauder 4w1."

I like that it is paraben free, affordable, has beautiful natural looking medium coverage, is hydrating, and actually has shades that match my medium yellowy-olive skin tone.
It looks like my bare skin but more even. I can't speak to the longevity because I don't really pay attention to that, haha. 
Yes it does totally smell like what you would paint your wall with! I'm willing to put up with it for an affordable paraben free option that actually matches my skin. * I love this and would buy it again... only a shade lighter. * Got this foundation about 2 weeks ago… just don't even look into this product.

This has turned into my favorite foundation especially just in time for summer! * Seems to give a healthier glow! * My mature skin seems to have become dry for this first time ever this winter. I was looking for a light skin tint with moisturizing properties, but I didn't want to look ""dewy,"" per se. I absolutely love this! The color match is excellent, perfect light-medium coverage. It doesn't look cakes, nor did it separate, or settle into lines. 10/10! * I dont do foundation but put this over my suncreen moisturizer. Gives me s youthful, even skin tone. * I honestly loved the product itself, unfortunately I just couldn't find my shade. My skin looked very smooth and it was great on my combination skin! * This product has gotten a lot of hype on social media, and I'm not sure why. It is extremely THICK and goopy as heck. I didn't like the feeling it gave me, almost sticky. It sat so heavy on my face. If you don't mind that, this might be great. But I like my makeup to not feel like I am wearing a mask or film on my face. I will pass on this. * I have been looking for a light Tinted foundation with SPF. This one is amazing.

Great for older skin! * First time trying this product but I will get more * I absolutely love this tint for the summer. Apply with a brush for higher coverage, about two layers. I struggle with acne scars, in those areas I apply glossier concealer and feel satisfied. During the winter I see myself applying this for running errands or more lowkey events. I get a lot of compliments with this tint at this time of the year for its radiance. * I've been using this for a little over a month and was having postpartum breakouts prior to it, thsi helped soothe my skin and stopped mh breakouts.

I tend to have an oily T-zone & everywhere else is pretty much dry but this foundation doesn't ever really cake or flake on me. I 100% recommend this foundation for an everyday natural look! * I love this foundation! it's affordable and stays on all throughout the work day * this foundation is surprisingly good for the price. it's buildable, smooth, and has a nice matte but natural finish. it flaked on my chin area after a few hours, but that could be my skin type. * Love this for my combo skin. I'm not extremely oily but I needed something that would actually last throughout the day without needing to powder by midday. I actually like it better than the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I am shade 090 in Lancome but have not been able to find a good color match as 090 is too light and the next shades are too dark and orange. I have very fair neutral skin. I prefer how the covergirl looks, it is very smooth with slightly better coverage, and L20 is a great shade and a closer match than the Lancome (maybe L20 is a dash too light but it looks perfect after bronzer). It gives a natural matte finish that doesn't cling or look cakey. Works well on my middle-age skin with fine lines. Has great medium-full coverage. Highly recommend! * I really love this foundation and I will continue to purchase it! Affordable and covers well."

(second guessing myself) I went a sister shade lighter and It was a little less noticeable but it still made me yellowish orange so I mixed it with a different foundation to see what would happen and it fixed the issue for me but for those that wanna know by itself it shifts color when dry but it's still a light smooth waterproof formula.. 
might I add,  what might not work for me might work better for you, it's always best to mess around and find out * This is honestly a really good sheer foundation. Its not full coverage but percect for the summer needing something lightweight. Shade match was surprising good. I would definitely buy again * Not good. Coverage is pretty bad. Watery. Dont buy * Great product * Great for the price but doesn't stay all day but the shades are great they just need more for other skin tones. * For the price that its sold at, this foundation is amazing!

It's a shame they seem to be discontinuing this product, when really it just required better marketing. The replacement medium coverage foundation is not an equal product. * Tried for the price…but this foundation os awful. Thick & doesnt blend, smells like dry erase markers, & the foundation was seperated in tube. 
Very cakey lookong foundation * I was introduced to this foundation by a friend, and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin; this was the FIRST foundation that stayed matte on me all day. I wouldn't recommend for beginners OR people with dry skin as the foundation is fast drying and you have to work fast when you apply it!

I used it and yes it was worth it the staying power  was good specially of your from az. * Have a hard time matching foundation to my skin tone and this matches me perfectly. It looks natural and has buildable coverage. For the price, you cannot beat it, I own foundations double the price and this is now my go to. Give it a shot. :D * I bought this like a month ago and I love it! You dont have to use a lot and literally your face is flawless. One of the things i love about this product is it doesnt dry out your skin. I got the shade neutral 25 and id say that its a mix of fair and tan. I also really love the application part of it, the wand is really nice!!! * Covers a lot without having to apply a ton. Love the application wand * I love this foundation I find myself reaching for it more  often than the others. it's not drying, not greasy,  the coverage looks like my skin but glowy, and not cakey. The kiko Milano powder is awesome too for baking BTW. This foundation is way very similar to TF Born this way foundation, (but not as greasy) kiko milano is underrated IMO. Yes I would recommend."
164,well people,bio stick foundation,pimprod2008575,2553269," * The old formula truly was the best, I looked forward to applying it every morning.  Blended like a dream, gorgeous satin finish, blurred imperfections, clean and fragrance free.  The color 1C was actually a cool tone, this new 1C is PEACH toned....very warm, and the formula change truly makes me sad....it's not the same. They ruined a perfect product. * I absolutely love this product! The smell is a bit strong and the application is a little off-putting, but it blends great and looks great! I found that instead of using a traditional primer like elf power grip, using a setting spray to prime made application easier and blending smoother. * My skin looked worse with this. Highlighying pores no matter how much or how many different methods i use. And shows every bump, dry patch, etc. its so weird. Like the opposite of why we wear makeup in the first place. So mad i was fooled that im writing a review * I have very fair and pink skin and have always had trouble finding foundations that match my tone, never mind work well on my oily/combination skin, but I will say that this one does a good job! I was nervous buying online without match testing, but I got the 1C and would say its a pretty good match for my skin tone. 

My pros for this are definitely: generaly matches my skin, works well with my oily/combination skin, it coming in a stick format is very convenient and mess free, stays on very well, looks natural, and doesnt make my skin feel gross

My cons would be: not the perfect match (wish the undertones were more p and that the shade was slightly lighter), can get a little cakey if i put too much on, and a little hard to blend. 

For context I've been wearing Too Faced Born this way foundation in the shade Snow for years now because it's the only foundation I've found that comes close to matching my skin, but I've always run into the same problem of not being able to apply the foundation too thick because then you can tell it's not a true match. Anyway, I would say overall thi one does a better job, has better ingredients, feels better on my skin, and is a good price point.

My last points would be dont let the 1 star reviews scare you, this foundation is very nice and as long as you use a wet sponge to apply and don't mind the mild scent of castor oil that fades in about 30 minutes :) * The old formula was amazing.  Shade 1C was a perfect cool tone as described.  This newer version is very peach in tone and no longer qualifies as cool toned.  So  if you are a fair, cool toned person...look elsewhere. * I have come back to this product again and again after trying other hydrating foundations that are too thin and messy or settle into pores. This is my favorite non-SPF foundation. It is like a natural version of cover girl compact makeup. It's vegetable oil based so it does smell like olive oil. But it's so nourishing and convenient with the solid stick. It smooths on well to a medium coverage and natural dewy finish that doesn't settle into my pores or cause breakouts for me. And with a light powder to set, it stays all day. I do wish they had lighter shades as the lightest warm (2W) is a bit dark for me in winter. But I'm a repeat customer of this good clean dry skin foundation option. * This brand is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I live in the desert and ingredients like hyaluronic acid just pull the water out of your skin because there's no water in the air here. It seemed like every make up and skincare brand hopped on that train and I couldn't find anything for my skin (dry) and climate type. I hope they never change the formula! I'm almost 30 and I'm starting to get crows ft etc and this really does a great job of camouflage without settling in any wrinkles."

It was easy to blend and didnt make me feel cakey or end up patchy at the end of the day. It evened my skin tone out very nicely! My boyfriend didnt even know I was wearing makeup but I felt like I still got the coverage/effect I was going for. Definitely recommend trying it out! * I use this everyday!

I tried the Good Apple version
 There's no Comparison... bring this back * I need this to come back!!! I haven't found anything that i really like. * I bought this product for many years and I always loved it. However since Kat sold the product off its formula has changed for the worse. I've tried the new version and it's awful I've tried fenti, tarte, double wear, and two others they all suck! * Mine always smelled like paint. Super thick, matte and cakey but superior coverage to anything made ever. * Please bring it back!!!! Nothing compares * My favorite and un replaceable foundation. I haven't found a similar to this one not one!!! This is the best foundation for OILY skin and tge coverage amazing. Loved that it last all day mind you i live in Az and the weather is HOT this foundation would not move at all. Pleas eplease being this back because Good Apple is not close at all in coverage and wear. * This was the only matte foundation i found that made my textred mature skin not look more textured and makes me look older like all other matte foundations I've tried! This one looks so amazing. Stayed all day and i sweat alot on my face. I really dont know why they got rid of this foundation. I literally have not one bad thing to say about this foundation. I really hope they bring this back!!!"
169,lorac,pro soft focus longwear foundation,pimprod2013331,2558415," * I don't like to leave bad reviews, but this foundation was a disappointment for me as I love, LOVE their glass primer. First is that it came out very watery. I understand it is buildable but this was really runny. As others have said, it has a faint maple syrup smell - but for me it was maple syrup mixed with chemical. I am also having some kind of skin reaction and irritation since using this. Nothing major, but enough for me to not use it anymore after 2 uses. Lastly it did not last more than 4 hours. It smeared, creased and caked in areas on my face. Luckily I bought this on sale and just gave it to my niece. This might work for others but for me - no. Sadly their foundation does not live up to the quality of their glass primer - which for me is the best primer in all my years. * I was amazed at how full coverage it is! & how it dosent even look like im wearing foundation! I mean wow !! Definetly will be purchasing more! * I never had a Lorac foundation before, but I know the brand revamped so I thought I would give this a try. It did not dissapoint!!! I have roseacea and dry skin, and this worked amazing for coverage. There is a small scent but it's sweet and lowkey reminds my of syrup. Besides that there are no complaints from me. I would highly recommend using the shade finder tool to compare it to your current foundation. I'm an olive skin tone so it's hard to find foundations that are inclusive of that. I got a summer shade and a winter shade because  I love this foundation so much. Highly recommend! * I don't know if this is supposed to be runny as only a few reviews mentioned it but it's basically colored water & it's so messy. I will never buy this again. * This is my new favorite foundation,
! It has excellent coverage with a natural finish. I have dry skin but find a lot of the hydrating foundations transfer and/or leave my skin looking oily by the end of the day, this foundation looks good all day and doesn't transfer. It does have a incredibly potent smell that lingers long after it dries, but I have been able to get used to it and I only notice when during application. * Although I like this foundation in everyway I have to give a low score because it isn't CRUELTY FREE.   There is no good reason for testing on animals and there are plenty of good products available which ARE CRUELTY FREE too. * I purchased this on a whim as i saw it on sale. I received it at the same time another package with the new Prada foundation came in, and I'm shocked that i like the Lorac foundation more than the Prada!  I applied this with my Hourglass foundation brush as the formula is quite thin amd it went on beautifully. Its so smooth and the finish really is a soft matte. It seems to be very long lasting as well. My first favorite foundation of the year."
170,kiko milano,active foundation,pimprod2036981,2607365," * Ok, there are a lot of decent stick foundations out now (not great, but decent).  I don't think this is one of them.  It's the old school sort--the kind that feels very waxy.  If you have dry skin, you will not be pleased.  It's very hard to get the finish to look good, and even harder to get it to stay looking good.  It's probably not going to save you time or make your life easier on the go. * I am blown away by how amazing this stick foundation is!! It gives a barely there feeling which i love. It does not settle into fine lines and stays on all day. Can't wait to try more stuff from the brand!!! * This stick goes on sooo smoothly! Absolutely love the consistency of this makeup! My skin looked like a barely there makeup look, exactly what i was going for. Definitely need to extend the shade range of this makeup but other than that this stuff is amazing!! * great coverage for my skin tone and felt smooth.  please add more skin tones so all people can have it. * this shade range has every type of tone for lighter skin but for 1 dark complexion do better * I honestly dont unserstand why people who've never tried this give it a low rating due to the shade range. This is an Italian owned brand. Majority of the population is olive, light to medium skintones. Many of them/us have a hard time finding our shades. Go try Fenty Beauty if you dont like it. Anyways, this is fantastic. Super blendable and looks smooth on my texture. * the shade range is disgusting. its not like italy is a sheltered country or anything, many POC reside there. darker women, men, and all in between deserve to have products that fit their skin too. do better."
171,maybelline,instant age rewind perfector 4-in-1 whipped matte makeup,pimprod2028923,2590459," * Its like it never dries and doesnt stick to your skin. So skin ends up looking splotchy. Wipes off easily and blends with nothing. Won't purchase again! * I have combination skin, super oily with dry patches. I hate the feeling of foundation so I just prefer something super light to even out my color and mattify me. This stuff is perfect! It feels completely weightless and looks natural. It wears off gradually by the end of the day without looking crazy. Definitely my favorite face makeup! * It wiped off easily didn't  stay on my face. I would use it in a certain spot and i would try and apply it somewhere else and it would wipe off * As for color match, it's perfect. But it doesn't really cover up my imperfections like age spots * Looks great on my skin. * Very light coverage. Feels so light and soft on skin. Not oily after a full day of wear! Doesn't cover blemishes the best but will give a nice even tone over the skin. Blends nicely! * I loved this! Its very light weight. I used under this my normal skin car rountine. And i wear elf glow sunscreen and halo glow with this bb cream and i loved the result. I do use conceler as well. And i dont feel caked on. Honestly try this method."
172,flower beauty,get real serum foundation,pimprod2022967,2577491," * I am someone who likes a no-makeup look, and this is perfect! The product is very hydrating and goes on in a nice thin coat to make you look flawless and like you don't have makeup on. Unsure if it's buildable since I didn't try. Highly recommend! * I absolutely love this foundation! It is even better then the very high end products i have purchased.  Hydrated, natural looking skin is what my aging skin looks like when using it. I cannot believe what an absolute bargain this foundation is. I would gladly pay triple the price. I hope they never stop making it! * Moisturizing and glowy with light coverage, this foundation plays well with powder and cream cheek products on top. It does not layer itself well (looks very textured), however. No other complaints, as long as you like light coverage glow with a single layer of product I'd say you have found the best product in the market in this price range! Also stays preserved well, in case you're soemone that takes a while to go through product. * I LOVED the Light Illusion foundation! Then I tried this. WHAT a letdown. It is runny, thin, has NO coverage. THE COLOR( I wear L2  IVORY in Light Illusion) is also DARKER than LIGHT ILLUSION. The L2 Ivory is the same as the L4 warm beige. * I bought this on a whim on sale because ive heard good things and actually really like other flower products BUT this is was a let down I understand its a ""serum"" fondation and not meant to provide coverage thats fine what I DIDNT LIKE was the fact that i could not get this to stick to my skin it transferred and moved around and good luck trying to apply anything on top of it * I love serum foundations and this one did not disappoint! This one is up there with the more high end serum foundations in every way but without the crazy price tag. It is sheer - exactly what I like! - and blends like a dream. It has staying power and flattering shades. A little goes a long way. It plays well with other products both cream and powder. No moisturizer needed as it is very hydrating - my dry mature skin drinks this up and loves it! Very happy! * I've got combination skin with an oily t-zone and dry on my forehead and underneath my eyes, this doesn't bring any of this texture out! It's light coverage which I like for daily wear and for hot days."
173,pacifica,ultra cc cream radiant foundation with 100% physical broad spectrum spf 17,pimprod2026038,2582152," * this doesn't blend well at all. it's streaky, it doesn't cover, it smells odd. it's just a horrible horrible product. * I have used this foundation for years but the formula has changed, and it is awful. It is so thick it won't pump out. The foundation is clumpy and doesn't spread at all. Why did they change a good product???? * This foundation is worth trying! Creamy, spreads nicely (I use a brush), nice colour matching (I consider myself a medium brown skin colour). Overall great product! * I cannot say enough GOOD THINGS about this CC cream. There comes the point when foundation is out, and CC cream is in, and I am pleased with this product's color choices, smooth texture, and luminescence. I mix two shades and apply the first color as a primer. This CC cream doubles as my concealer; it's that easy to apply. * This product: separates BADLY and doe not blend well at all; Smells weird and chemical-y; offers VERY little coverage, even for a CC cream, and is overpriced because of all these factors. Positives: it makes skin glowy and has SPF. I wouldn't buy this personally - Pacifica's skincare and fragrance are AMAZING, but makeup seems to be a weak point. * This product came out separated. Tried shaking product to get product mixed together and it came out somewhat like foundation. Does not go on skin nicely. Do not recommend. * it comes out as a clear oil with little specs of color that don't blend."

This breathable, light satin finish can be set up on itself until youve found your inner teenage beauty queen! It's perfect for my skin type & it smells lovely too. A+ Ulta! * I love this lightweight easy to apply buildable foundation.  And so easy to match my complexion. * it appears that this foundation is being discontinued & I'm so upset. i have 51 y.o. mature, incredibly dry skin. this foundation is so wonderful & I have never found anything comparable. i need this in my makeup arsenal!!! * Please don't discontinue this item! It's the only foundation that works for my mature skin. It goes on so nice and smooth and cover just enough. Please please PLEASE bring back some of the lighter colors. * I bought this over the holidays and LOVED it!! Goes on easily and is weightless. Soooo disappointed to see that my shade is not available. Please do not discontinue this product. * My perfect shade is Light to Medium Cool.  Not available the last 2 times I've tried to buy.  What's up with that.  Not everybody needs a dark shade.  I would venture to say there are more who want lighter shades. Love the silky formula!"

I was not expecting to fall in love with this product, but it's truly flawless. I have NEVER had a shade match me so accurately. This product is buildable and can be worn for 100% full coverage or as a tint. The color is pigmented enough to cover dark undereye without concealer for a very natural ""no makeup"" finish. The price is a steal lol * I have never had a more perfect color match in my entire life. I show this to the older women in my family and you would think I was literally doing a magic trick lol shock awe and wonder. I often and loudly recommend this in True Caramel. Perfect for lace on wigs or just on skin * The foundation is very smooth and moisturizing.  It provides medium coverage, so I build it by applying several applications to get a more full coverage.  It is a great product for the price. * I have purchased this product before and I liked it. This time the product was used. It had a finger smudge print on it when l opened it and the sponge applicator had make all on one side. I ended up purchasing something else at another store. * First, note this has the ingredients that Danessa Myricks uses for her foundation at an affordable cost. This provides a great shade match, makes skin look healthy and even, easy to take with you and stays on even if you sweat. The magnesium carbonate in the formula absolutely is wonderful for sweaty moments. I just find you can't really apply it with anything other than a sponge. Brushes with dense round tops don't pick it up well, as nothing else does. If you don't want to buy a beauty sponge you'll be fine to use the one it comes with. * Great shade for Hispanic women."
176,essence,keep me covered powder,pimprod2043728,2618266," * I love this powder! On top of liquid foundation of course. It gives your foundation that extra boost and smooths out your skin even more. I have Extremely oily skin, I'm talking about im already getting oily an hour after I put my makeup on and this powder does not separate. I even use it to touch up my makeup and makes my skin look smooth and fresh and doesn't cake. best powder I ever used, works just as good as the Mac studio fix plus powder in my opinion. Get it! * The power broke during shipping. And it makes gou look evey ghostly. It ashes out anytning you have on your face * I have used this several times and it's important to remember this is a powder foundation, not a setting powder. it's fantastic when used over moisturizer and primer. also great for touch ups. it definitely looks cakey when not used as described. * This will seperate your makeup, does not look good on almost any skintone, ashy, cakey, and its extremely hard to open. * I Used it to set and it compeltly left a cast and made my makeup look cakey had go wipe alot but over all crumbled snd separated horribly !! Plz dont get this * smells horrendous * While the quality of this product is ok, there is a very thin layer with empty space underneath so the pressed powder will crumble to bits on you."

The color is a little off for me but that may be my fault. I do mix it with another foundation. It's very creamy which i love. I have a face tattoo and it does a pretty good job of concealing. This foundation might not be for everyone but I do like it! * After researching this brand, I was extremely excited to try this foundation. When I first applied it the shade took my breath away! However, throughout the day it would smear and wipe off so easily :( * The consistency of the foundation is wonderful. It's super light and just melts into the skin. The color range is also phenomenal. I've never found a shade that matched me so perfectly. It literally looks like my skin. All of my friends, family members, and coworkers inquire about the foundation I use, and I have to share the link often. * Great foundation for the price. And it has spf! * Matched me perfectly. Wasn't to heavy made me look flawless * Rubs off and oily I bought two hoping to return one * After searching & searching for the perfect blend/shade…..I'm completely satisfied…."

(for shade match reference: i also use loreal tinted serum shade 4-5 and the maybelline super stay skin tint in shade 220 & have oily skin) ANYWAYS YALL TRY THIS OUT ITS SO GOOD AND PLEASE NEVER GET RID OF THIS PRODUCT I LITERALLY BEG U GIRL!!! * i wanted something less full coverage, as it would crease in my smile lines, ans this does the trick! its a beautiful finish and lasts my full work shifts! no creasing either!!! * Why would the name be tinted foundation? Isnt all foundation tinted""? Maybe try tinted moisturizer * Light and hydrating product that evens out dull skin without looking heavy! Great for looking put together on minimal makeup days. * The coverage of this bad boy is wat too light to be called a foundation, but it doesnt have any skin care benefits which is I guess why they can't call it BB cream. It's refreshing to have a product with light coverage and a natural finish instead of dewy. Great for no makeup makeup days. * I found the Tawny shade of L.A. Girl Tinted Foundation in my local Ulta's clearance section and figured I'd give it a try. When I got home, I used Ulta's shade matcher and it told me I was really Warm Sand in this product (based off entering Ginger for bareMineral's COMPLEXION RESCUE Tinted Moisturizer Mineral SPF 30). Warm Sand perfectly matches my skin right now during the winter. I'll try Tawny again in the spring/summer, but it was a close match too. I love how lightweight this product feels and how easy it is to apply — I dot it on right from the tube and the dab/blend with a lightly moist makeup sponge. It looks just slightly dewy but doesn't feel overly wet or sticky. It also works well under my bareMinerals BAREPRO 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation if I want to look more made up, but between the price and its natural look when used solo, it fits well with my minimalist approach to makeup. * I am 66 years old. It settled into my wrinkles and emphasized them.  Very sheer coverage. Not a good choice for me."
179,well people,bio powder foundation,pimprod2008579,2553264," * Light, sheer. Shade range is confusing. If unsure, go a bit darker than normal. * I ordered 2W - Warm light - and it was almost white, so light and clearly defective. It did absolutely nothing other than make me have a Casper look. It is so sheer I can't imagine it doing anything even if it was the correct color.  I contacted Well People, I thought they should know how bad the product was, and they didn't care. * W3ll people... we need to talk about the shade range. People with darker skin tones like makeup too yet the shade range completely excludes anyone beyond tan. Thankfully the darkest shade works for me so I enjoy the product but it's hard to get behind a brand that doesn't give darker skintones a thought. * I was really hoping this product would work for me but it didn't. I found the baked foundation to be much more drying than other pressed powders I've previously used. Felt like it didn't go on well and had horrible coverage. Will not be buying again. * Takes forever to build up. Not for anyone who wants medium to full coverage. Light to medium at best. * Honestly if you're looking for a foundation to take a chance on.. this is definitely it. I'm not sure why I even chose to buy this but I love it!! I use it over concealer and it evens out my skin tone perfectly. Also does not make me look too orangey or cakey. * Just meh"

It was so easy to apply, felt nice on my skin, looks natural and I think m10 is my shade - it is spot on (for my beautiful summer complexion ) I'm excited to have found Mented! not a con for me, because i don't choose a makeup to smell good, but definitely seems like fragrance wasn't added.

I have pretty dry sky so I know to add a moisturizer before applying this. I am not saying this drying…but makeup ondry skin can appear patchy * This product feels and looks like you have no product on. * I have searched for the perfect match years! So excited to have finally found a shade so spot on with my skin tone that it's almost scary. The stick foundation is easy to apply, blends well and leaves me a great natural glow. * Looked awful on me. Horrible on oily skin and def dont get if you have light skin. This foundation isnt made for light skin tones which sucks. * Perfect match almost feels like a tinted moisturizer. I'm oily so I still need a powder but for stick makeup it goes on smooth and doesn't run off. I'm sold * Okay so hear me out.. the color match to my skin is amazing!!! it blended beautifully. However, I have combo oily skin and nothing could have prepared me for how shiny and oily this foundation is. This is not a matte foundation so beware!! * Hidden Gem hands down. I have been looking for a good foundation in general for a few years now, I went high end low end drugstore I went tinted moisturizer to full coverage and non did what I actually wanted. I love make up but finding a good foundation for my oily skin that wont force me to re touch (which I'm horrible at by the way, always makes it worse) was close to impossible without making me feel like I have pounds of make up on especially for work. I had tried the Hourglass foundation stick which was highly rated and felt very chalky on my skin. I did a search of stick foundations and came across this one. I am the lightest shade in this line and am on my way to re up for a 3rd time! I have never purchased 1 item more than once since they end up not working out for a while. The coverage is amazing from one layer to a 2 layers if I want a fuller look. It glides on like butter on my skin  and gives me a glow without an oily look if that makes sense. I rarely have to completely set my face because it sets so nice on its own and will literally last me over 9 hours without any cracks or separation and looks like I just applied it minutes ago. It makes my face feel hydrated and not like I'm wearing loads of make up. This is a long review and I never leave a review but I am truly in love with this foundation! I am so thankful for this brand because I am the in between when it comes to make up, I'm a semy fare complexion with neutral undertones. Many lines have a Yellow undertone or an olive undertone which makes me look washed out. This is truly a bang for your buck and will leave your make up looking flawless."

I have very pale, dry skin, this shade range cancels out any issues ive had with light foundations that are too orange, does not stick to or emphasize when i have dryness. I 100% recommend this product. * This doesn't settle in wrinkles like a lot of foundation.  It is a bit hard to use to start with but once you figure it out it's very nice.  Good for older and younger skin.  I'm 64 and it's the best I've ever used. * This foundation is perfect for evening out skin tone without making it look like you painted your make up on. I really love pairing it with cream contour and cream blush, and then just setting it with a setting spray- it gives a gorgeous dewy finish. You can set it with powder to make it a little more long lasting too. I always try to catch it on sale. I think having a gorgeous light coverage foundation like this is perfect for an interview, meeting someone new, or embracing your natural beauty! Its made me feel so much more confident in my own skin. * The origin to my villain story. I listened to an ULTA employee, first foundation for my high school homecoming. Three days later I broke out, having clear skin all my life. Ever since, it never stopped. I had to go on meds to cure my acne. Don't use. * I used to use the old face and body without the radiance and always loved it so im not surprised I love the new version especially because I like more of a sheen/glow to my skin. This is a very sheer coverage foundation but is buildable if you want a little more coverage. Also I can apply this over my skincare without it pilling! * I never tried the original face and body. Honestly, I was never interested in this foundation until I started watching Miss Megan Robinson on tik tok. Seriously you NEED to follow her!! I generally have oily skin. It's been a lot more calm, and a lot less oily after I got rid of all the actives, and JUST started washing, toning, and using AN OIL (I know right, but it's true, oil loves oil, using an oil will keep your skin from producing a lot of oil) I can now wear this foundation confidently, and it is BEAUTIFUL!! It's friction activated so I suggest applying with fingers and rubbing it in so you can start to feel the ""gripping and thickening"" action that happens with this foundation(which is the best most fun part for me). The coverage is obviously light but it looks like perfected skin. Only the best things are peeking through. Everything blends nicely on top, and I mean EVERYTHING, from all different brands. It wears great too and looks even better as the day goes on. Its softly radiant and skin like if you powder (which I still do) and if you don't you'll look like a freshly hot glazed donut (some people like that, some people don't) I get the hype of this foundation and dare I say it's made it into my top 5 line up!!?? Coming from an oily girl that is shocking. If you're wondering, I use the Danessa Myricks yummy skin balm in translucent as a primer, this foundation, all my other creams and liquids, and I set with Mac studio fix powder and one size setting spray. PERFECTED NATURAL RADIANT SKIN * Wear it everyday and have received unprovoked complements."
186,vdl,perfect lasting foundation,pimprod2006000,2560248," * I LOVE this foundation! It's definitely full coverage. It look so beautiful like natural skin! It doesn't dry matte, so definitely set it with powder. I'd say a little goes a long way! It last all day & still look beautiful even after a workout. The only areas that would slightly crease would be around my smile lines & chin but nothing crazy. I wish the foundation would be more available but it's so hard to find & the shade range isn't the best but overall 10/10 I would recommend! My closest shade is A05.5. I also tried mixing V05 & V04 to get my shade if anyone is wondering. I hope this helps.  :) * Coming from an Ulta Employee, after trying every foundation under the sun, this foundation makes my skin look FLAWLESS, airbrushed, smooth. I do have to set with a translucent loose powder because it is still a little tacky in my opinion. Shades are FANTASTIC. A02 matches me the closest; however if there was a slightly paler shade with a yellow undertone that would be my perfect match. I ordered A01 and A02 on YesStyle and to me 1 was almost darker than 2, but it may just be the undertones. ULTA PLEASE BRING THIS BACK. It took me over a week with express shipping on YS btw I paid $19 extra FYI In case anyone was going to order it, I think it ships from China. Idk what is in this foundation but  I want to buy every bottle just incase it ever gets discontinued😅😭😭😭 * My relationship with foundation is a nightmare,I'm a brown skin girl with golden undertones in the summer and pale skin in the winter,without much prep this foundation matched me perfectly and stayed on ALL NIGHT,the a night of dancing 💕LOVE THIS STUFF * Please restock ASAP! This is my favorite foundation!! I literally bought 3 bottles because I have a feeling Ulta might discontinue this foundation...
 FYI- you can still find VDL on Yesstyle BUT it's NOT the same foundation. The one on Yesstyle has SPF & it has more of a dewy finish 😩 * I hope Ulta is not going to stop selling this foundation. It is an amazing satin finish foundation. Looks flawless on the skin and makes blemished skin look smooth. Wears beautifully throughout the day and is full coverage. Highly recommend. FYI if they stop selling it at Ulta you can find it on YesStyle. * I bought this foundation in the color A06. I tend to have a hard time finding foundations because I am in the weird shade range where I'm typically between medium/tan and dark/deep in various brands. I have Neutral slightly golden/olive undertones and find that many brands get close but not perfectly my shade. Most times foundations are too golden (almost orange looking), too cool, exactly neutral when I need just a touch of yellow in the foundation, or they just skip my shade altogether. I was pleasantly surprised when this foundation was an exact match. I love the natural finish to this foundation. I have dehydrated combo skin that if not properly hydrated will get oily in the t-zone (mostly nose area) and will remain normal or slightly dry everywhere else. When I wear this for several hours my foundation goes from very natural to radiant but not oily as my t-zone starts to break into a bit of a shine. I really don't have anything bad to say about this foundation except because of the limited shade range there's a chance you may not find a good match depending on your skin tone and undertone. Hopefully Ulta continues to keep this foundation available. * I would describe this foundation on my skin as full coverage with a satin/slight dewy finish. I have acne prone skin with acne scars and this foundation covers everything without causing any texture. Long wearing and mask proof. Doesn't cause breakouts. Would recommend for various skin types."
187,l'orÃ©al,age perfect creamy powder foundation,pimprod2021675,2569747," * Very light, silky powder texture. The ""creamy"" title is very deceiving though. It's powder. And quite drying immediately on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this for aging skin whatsoever. Great product for on the go touch ups on oily skin. * I don't care for the sponge applicator because it really doesn't go on right, but I found that using a brush to apply is so much better and it goes on more evenly.  You can add more where needed without it looking blotchy.  I love it! Used the color Sienna * Goes smooth and cover some imperfections, but looks natural. Leaves your skin soft and beautiful. * Lightest shade, Ivory.  You MUST prep the skin with moisturizer, sunscreen and either CT Hollywood Flawless Filter or the Maybeline knockoff or a dewy primer or sunscreen.  Buff in with a brush after applying concealer where needed.  Use powder bronzer, blush and highlight and a setting spray.  It looked amazing on my 48 year old dry skin and lasted all day.  Not powdery, didn't settle in lines, let's your skin peek through (is light coverage).   I really love it. * I thought since it's called age perfect it would be a moisturizing creamy powder. Nope. It's super drying and I have combination oily skin not even dry. Feels horrible right on application You can feel the makeup. Didn't blur anything. I had to take it off within 10 mins of application. Don't buy this stuff. * I wanted to try a cream to powder foundation to try to cover some dark spots. 
This covered what I wanted. It does look a little dry after application but I'm oily so it looks more natural after a few hours. * I love the age rewind concealer and seen this after looking for a good powder foundation. it is a really creamy, finely milled powder. I don't think it's really pigmented but you get enough coverage to even everything out and in my opinion it really does blur. I use a flat top Kabuki brush to buff it in, slowly building up layers. I take product and tap it in where I need more coverage with a concealer brush. I find I get the most coverage this way. it's like your skin but better. gives you a nice natural finish and doesn't look cakey if you slowly buff and build. will be trying this as a setting powder for liquid since it blurs. it also doesn't make me breakout!"
188,hynt beauty,encore pressed powder foundation,pimprod2014352,2564466," * I was so excited to try this powder because of all of the positive reviews. Unfortunately, This product didn't work for my dry skin. And for the price I doesn't have great coverage. I don't see this product any different from any other pressed powder. Also, this powder has sparkles in it I guess to conceal how drying and powdery it makes the skin.. * I love this powder, my skin is dry but this powder always feels comfortable on, never adds any texture as other powders have for me in the past, def one of my fav powders * I LOVE this pressed powder! It takes away the look of shine and makes my skin look refined and even toned. I bought Ivory and it is the ideal shade for my skin tone, medium fair with pink undertones. It works well worn over concealer and foundation, or on its own. And, better still, it looks invisible and feels like nothing on skin! The mirrored compact is the perfect size for taking on the go and it even comes with an applicator sponge on a clear, hinged divider inside. Hynt thought of everything with this pressed powder! I will definitely buy again:) * I've always been reluctant to wear powder - most of the time I end up looking cake-y. This finishing powder is a game changer - so easy to apply and bonus, the packaging is so adorable! But more importantly my skin looks so velvety and super plump, definitely will be coming back for more when I'm through with this! * Love using this powder in-between zoom meetings to touch up my skin. Just gives me a more even/finished and natural look * One of my favorite products from Hynt * I used this foundation with the foam puff it came packaged with. Do not use with a brush, the powder is finely milled and will fall off your brush! I wore it over serum and moisturizer. My face got a little shiny throughout the day but that is common for me, as I have combination skin. I like that the coverage is buildable, I was able to apply two layers and achieved the coverage I was looking for. Best of all, the ingredients are natural and truly clean! No SLS, no parabens, no Lauryl Lysine, no Bismuth oxychloride! So happy Ulta is carrying this brand!"
189,hourglass,vanish seamless finish liquid foundation,pimprod2020422,2575785," * For a pro makeup artist, ( yes, you need to be a pro to know how to work with it) this is so far one of the best foundations that I have ever worked with. I recommend performing a gentle face exfolation before bed time and removing any peach fuzz for any makeup aplication, not just this foundation. It makes a huge difference in aplication and appearance of the final look/finish.
It works best with the Vanish smoothing primer. (To smooth down the pores that every human being has) It is runny but extreamly pigmented. Do not use too much or it will look cakey.Best apply with a dense buffer brush (Morphe 444 is my favorite) and then press it in with a beauty blender. I use the professional Kryolan setting spray first, and then set it with a good powder.( Jeffree Star, Fenty or Kryolan powder) It holds for 14h even in humid Florida. Best foundation for events. It's best for normal/ combination skin. I wish they had more shades.
Unfortunately it just has been discontinued, tho the company has gave me insites that they are working on perfecting the formula and making a new foundation for combination/oily skin (they currently carry luminous foundations for normal/dry skin) * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * This product is so thin & runny! Like water consistency. I pumped one pump on my hand & it literally dripped off me. I shook the bottle so many times & it still remained runny. I gave it a try on my face because I wanted to give the foundation a chance but the product just settled right into any crevice it could. I could literally see wrinkles/lines I didn't even know I had. * I got this during a sale and was so excited to try my first Hourglass product. I followed the instructions and reviews and only used a very little amount. It brings out my pores horribly, dries down very weird and makes my skin dry, and even though it feels light on my skin my skin feels a tiny bit sticky, not something I usually experience with prestige brand foundations. This is a miss for me. * This foundation is very reminiscent of Marc Jacob's 'Remarcable' . Full coverage and matte with a pore filling matte primer underneath . The bad reviews are really just people who don't know how to apply makeup . * Words do not explain how buttery this foundation is I have dry to normal skin and it blends it two to three glides. Will never use another foundation"
190,smashbox,studio skin 24 hour full coverage waterproof foundation,pimprod2009758,2552423," * Luckily I night this on a good sale a ways back but it is just not it. I have combo oily skin and so far regardless of the primer or moisturizer this just doesn't look good and will break down. I've been using juvias place which I like ten times better and I don't have to try to make it work. This foundation also oxidizes orange..so not just a shade but it'll turn more orange as well. I'm gonna try to find something to mjx it with but I won't be purchasing again and wouldn't recommend it. * I have oily combo skin, and this foundation did not stand the test of time. It felt very heavy, and transferred with the slightest touch (with setting powder). Only a few hours in, and it was breaking apart on my face, highlighting even the slightest texture. My pores were literally drinking this product up. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a foundation, and could not wait to take it off. * I have combo skin, I use the Bobby brown moisturizer primer underneath and only use a tiny bit with a brush. Looks flawless!! Do not use to much product otherwise it will look cakey, if you need extra coverage apply only to specific area with smaller brush. * 32f (no active breakout/indented scars only on cheeks/combination skin)This foundation has the worst formula I have ever used on my skin. I tried two different primers underneath and tried it on it's own and it just refused to settle or smooth out. It creases badly and makes skin look dry and caked with very minimal use of the product that looked worse and worse if you tried to use even a tiny bit more. Powders and setting spray do nothing to help. I tried beauty blenders and brushes and neither made it better. I ended up going back to a trusty Revlon foundation that was way cheaper and a much better formula. Do not waste your money if you do not have perfect smooth skin. * I have sensitive skin with large amounts of rosacea and occasional eczema. This product covers my redness very well, and can many my dry areas seemingly disappear. Smashbox was also a line that came up multiple times during my search for products best for sensitive skin. * Maybe this just doesn't work with some skin types. I've given this several goes with different amounts of product and application techniques and it always manages to cake up and accentuate every pore after it's settled. I decided to give this one more go, applying after a glowy moisturizer that managed to save some of my other cakey products and it still had the same issues after setting for about 20 minutes. * It has perfect coverage,  a very little goes a long way.  Love the Matt finish I got.  Like  all foundations,  you have to prepare your skin before you applying anything to it.  Use a brush to apply.  I patted it on."
