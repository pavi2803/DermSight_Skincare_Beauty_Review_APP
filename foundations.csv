1,urban decay,face bond self-setting waterproof foundation,pimprod2044818,2623593," * This is the best foundation- looks flawless and it lasts! good coverage too! * I mean, the title pretty much   explains it all. One of my good friends died, and the funeral was half inside an old church/ half outside in 98 degree weather (honestly was hotter under the tarpes somehow).

I did a little research and read about it tending to run dry. I moisturized extra the night before and the morning of. Additionally, I made sure the primer I used was silicone based to match the foundation. It worked GREAT. I cried so much that day. and that night. and the days after. and earlier today.  You get the point.

If you ensure proper ""before care"" and use the correct type of primer, there's a great chance it works for you.

However, I ended up putting a hat on outside once we left the church and where the hat touched the makeup was melted off in chunks of sweaty cool toned light foundation. I didnt use any powder (just all nighter setting spray) to avoid being extra dry. When I looked in the mirror that night, it held up so very well given the circumstances. * This foundation is PERFECT for us oily girls. The dry down is perfect and blends perfectly without looking caked on. It's the perfect summer foundation. * This does absolutely nothing!  For the price, you get no shine, no color literally it's like you have nothing on. Don't waist your money. * Bought this on sale for half off as I was looking for a long lasting foundation. I usually wear the lightest shade in foundations, but this one was so light it was almost white. Since it waterproof it dries very quickly. It clung to my texture even after skin prep. * This makeup is amazing. It matches up with Too Face Fenty Becca Este Lauder Lancome 
I like natural the whole night even danced all night. Didn't need to touch up the only thing i touched up was my lipstick. This product just needs to be be put in a bigger bottle especially for everyday use I'll have to stock up so i don't get blind sided and it gets discontinued. * Love the coverage, but it tends to cling to any dry spots I may have and creases pretty bad around the eyes and mouth/ chin. It starts to look splotchy after about 8 hours of wear, even with setting spray"

3,dior,dior forever fluid skin glow foundation,pimprod2036824,2605019," * I love this foundation but the smell is outrageous! I cannot take it. I smelled it for a couple of hours. I never write reviews . * It feels great, and initially goes on great. I always use the Porefessional primer w/ any foundation.. then a sheer setting powder. Well my normal 2 foundations look great all day, pores look normal. The Dior lasted a couple hours before creeping all in my pores- making them stand out too much. Don't recommend if u have somewhat large pores.. mine r like medium craters w/ no makeup- lol * I have been using this for over 2 years now and love the dewy look and that it's buildable. Blush, powder, and concealer goes over it perfectly. It does oxidize and has an odd smell though. To me it doesn't smell like fragrance, but more like a chemical smell such as alcohol. For the price point, I think I will be researching alternatives. * Inloce a foubdation that guves a natural finish (not too matte, not shiny) and a bit of a ""radiant"" look with lightvreflecting sheen (but not some ghastly psychedelic prism effect). 

Based in thecdescriotion, inhooed this fitvthe above. It dies not. It keaves a shiny finish that is a bit ""sticky"" to the touch. I dud not care for it. I have nornal skin, perhaps occasionally (winter) on the dry side. * I have tried working with this product in sooo many ways and no matter what it becomes textural, dry, and patchy. Its just plain ugly. Ive never experienced anything like it. I also never leave reviews but after many months of trial and disappointment, I felt compelled to tell you to save your money. Love Dior generally good grief * A makeup artist applied this shade and it looked identical to my Cool tone pale skin. I was given a sample and used it at home. The color faded and turned out whiter than my skin tone. Half of my face was white and the other side was my natural pale skin with rosacea. Applied to entire face and I see streaks on my cheeks and it doesn't set well with Setting spray. I wanted to love this but its not giving me a natural dewy finish or the same color match. Too white! * This is actually the worst foundation I've ever used. I don't understand any positive reviews?? Cakey, oxidized, and hard to wash off. My skin looked more even and glowy before I put this junk on. Dior should stick to making handbags."

5,lancÃ´me,teint idole ultra wear 24h full coverage foundation,pimprod2039028,2608119," * The girl who matched me, matched me wrong.
I bought this for vacation. When I put it on, it was way off. I looked so pale. I didn't catch it at the store because I can't see good without good lighting. I wished I would have tried it at home before I went on vacation. * When I purchased my foundation it was the last one on the shelf and I was overjoyed. * Great coverage!! And it last all day * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This had a great smooth texture and felt great on the skin. Once it was on for a bit I didn't notice any transferring to clothes which is great! This color was slightly dark on me so I'll probably need to wear during the summer. The packaging was really lovely! The pump worked great, too. * New formula is not full coverage, but now ""buildable"". Oxidates, formula no longer fully sticks to the face. Foundation now comes off with sweat and tears within 8 hour use. Wore the original formula for years prior, even wore it to my grandpas funeral, with full on sobbing the foundation did not budge. Unlike the new formula, why am I still able to see my freckles and birth marks through the foundation. New formula feels like sunscreen sitting on the face. Even with 3 layers of building, it's not enough to fully cover. I used the entire bottle in hopes that every time I applied the experindcr would be different, not to mention the price of the foundation. New formula no longer upholds its intended said use. * I have FINALLY found my perfect match after going through countless brands. 350N is perfect for neutral olives. I've tried practically every brand and this shade is literally my skin in a bottle. I have combo skin and love that it doesn't stick to my occasional dry patches but is still durable throughout the day as I put on and take off face masks during the day at my job. Love love love and am happy to spend my money on something that matches perfectly and caters to olive! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The bottle is a nice frosted glass and very heavy. The scent is a bit strong but it fades after a bit. The fountain oxidized a little after it was applied but not too much. It is more on the matte side but the coverage was stunning. Love this foundation!"

8,nars,light reflecting advanced skincare foundation,pimprod2030141,2591117," * Great color match for my skin, love the thinner texture, gives medium to full coverage and doesn't look heavy or cakey on my skin * Foundation is beautiful on my skin, one of the best colour matches ever, like it was made exactly for my skin. Very natural appearance, covers slight imperfections even with a light application. Very comfortable on skin even in the ungodly heat of summer. * FINALLY a perfect color match for my pale skin!
Hydrating, but not in a heavy way! * It's been such a journey finding a formula and shade that works for me. I'm absolutely in love with this foundation and its build-ability and find myself doing my make up more often because of it * a great foundation * This is my favorite foundation! Definitely worth your money. I have dry skin and this foundation hydrates while not leaving too much of a dewy finish. Would recommend!! * Its truly a beautiful foundation, very light weight however it does not cover my acne scars 😩 ive tried to built it up as well. Unfortunately will be returning for aomething more full coverage!"
9,mac,studio fix fluid spf15 24hr matte foundation + oil control,pimprod2044825,2622206," * It's a good foundation if you want a matte look! I like it but it's really matte so you have to hurry and finish products quick or the foundation would dry fast! It's a good foundation, but it makes you have acne so don't use it a lot! Use it for only special occasions! * Terrible reformulation. It's not matte…it separates into greasy clumps within the hour. It's not long lasting….it comes off with the slightest touch. It emphasizes texture and lines in your face. It's a terrible, frustrating product now. Don't waste your time or money, another foundation will perform better than this. Truly disappointing now. * Ive been using this brand for over ten years and I unfortunately had to quit. The new foundation gets splotchy, weird texture, seperates through out the day, emphasizes texture, etc. im super disappointed * The best coverage without looking heavy. I am 61 and it looks great on my skin. I am so Happy I found Hannah at the MAC counter and tried several samples before choosing this! * I get great coverage & a flawless finish! Been my go to for the past year now. * Terrible new formula. This foundation was my favorite for years and years. The change they made to it has ruined it. It's a greasy, cakey mess that ages you because it settles on every single line on your face. I will no longer wear this foundation. * Ugh, the new formula is awful. I had to leave Mac and find something else. This new ""remastered"" foundation is cakey, settles into every pore and line on my face and separates into greasy clumps! It's not matte and absolutely not oil control….it the exact opposite; a greasy cakey mess that makes skin break out."

I don't have dry skin but this always makes my skin look so dry. I've tried it several times, years ago and i repurchased again recently to give it another shot, I wanted to like it so bad but it is the worst foundation I have ever tried * Hands down the best foundation I've ever purchased. Stayed on all day long and didn't crease where the tarte face tape would crease such as the sides of my nose, under eyes and on my chin. Couldn't recommend enough! * I have oily and sensitive skin and let me tell ya… my makeup looked just as good at night as it did in the AM and no breakouts from it. Ive never been more impressed with a foundation in my life. Dont walk, RUN and grab this foundation! The shade range is amazing as well. Cant say enough good things about this product. * I was excited to try this but man... These reviews must be rigged. It's really watery and settled into every pore and dry spot. Yes I used primer. * I am really loving the Fenty brand. This foundation covers everything without feeling heavy. And my skin looks and feels so much better. I have tried several Fenty products now and they are wonderful. They do exactly what they say they do. I would recommend to anyone. * Love the product.  Perfect for my complexion. * I bought this one 3 times"

14,it cosmetics,cc+ nude glow lightweight foundation + glow serum with spf 40,pimprod2031824,2594106," * The nude glow did not work for me. I need more coverage than this provides and will need to return.
Thx. Barb * I orderd the wrong shade, but also a little bit patchy on my skin, maybe I should try with my right shade * I am so happy I decided to purchase the ic cosmetic cc skin tint. It leaves a dewy glow on my dry skin that I absolutely love. Highly recommended * This product is the best option for my skin. Very lightweight but you can build more coverage if you need to. Since I have mature skin it's very important to me that it doesn't cakey. ""Less is more ""  is absolutely true !
this product works so well for me that I highly recommend it. * This glided on my face like butter-blended so well and was light. I'm super picky about what I put on my face. I've used everything from Chanel, Ila, Lancome, etc, but right now, I'm really loving this random sale purchase I made. I'd buy it even when it's not on sale. * This is my fave of the it cosmetics cc creams. The only drawback is it is very light coverage, but doesn't settle into pores or fine lines. I still need a concealer to cover redness. * My face gets pretty red and I've tried many foundations to help tone it down. This foundation and Nars is great. The formula is very light and doesn't leave my skin oily. I've gotten a lot of compliments wearing it."
15,estee lauder,futurist hydra rescue moisturizing foundation spf 45,pimprod2013152,2577966," * Applies on smoothly. My skin is changing, ugh perimenopause!!! I'm falling back in love with my skin using this product. * This really is a pretty foundation. I bounce a damp Beauty Blender to blend it over my face and neck.  I don't recommend more than one pump, because it can look heavy if more is used.  It has light reflection properties like Nars Light Reflecting (another favorite of mine), and it can look a bit ghostly in the right(wrong) light.  In Double Wear, I've worn Desert Beige and figured it would be an identical shade in Futurist, but it's not, and I think it's the light reflecting ingredients that make it lighter.  Fortunately, Desert Beige in Double Wear is now too dark for me, so this shade in Futurist is working pretty well.  Also, I've noticed that this foundation can separate and cling too dry patches if I  over-hydrate under it.  I will repurchase this foundation when I run out. * I've been searching for the right foundation for my maturing skin for awhile. My go-to drug store brands just weren't cutting it anymore and I've been so tired of the orangey tinge that I'm left with.  Even after trying a few of the nicer brands, I was still left with the orangey oxidation/dry down.  
I had read reviews on this brand & there were many that highly suggested it. When I had been in store, I finally asked an associate what they recommend for mature skin & they led me to this. They matched my tone & I was excited to give it a go. She asked if I needed concealer and I declined because I usually just build my foundation around as one. I have my new foundation a shot & I absolutely loved it. It's buildable for those problem areas. My only problem was I wasn't thinking when I purchased that this has SPF (45 SPF) and if you're using it too close to your eyes, it will leave them burning/irritated. Needless to say, that's where my problem areas are & I build more heavily around the eyes. My eyes were watering so bad. I didn't want to return the foundation because I loved it so much so I ended up going back for the concealer.  It all works so perfectly together and I'm no longer dealing with trying to blend in orangey make up lines. This foundation dries down and doesn't change shades.  I highly recommend! * Estée Lauder Double Wear was too heavy for me. Futurist Hydra Rescue is perfection. It's lightweight, covers redness better than IT products & color match is exceptional. I used IT for years but from now on I'm using this! * One of my go to foundations for day to day. This foundation has SPF 45 and is very hydrating. It does transfer which can get a bit annoying but thats because it contains sunscreen and hylauronic acid. * All ladies should own this! Applies on smooth, lasts all day and makes my skin look flawless!! * All of Estee Lauder's foundations are really great."

17,pur,4-in-1 love your selfie longwear foundation & concealer,pimprod2005671,2544533," * Color was too dark. * Was recommended this and loved it! * So light and blends well * I've been using this for years, initially because of having oily skin. I like the coverage and SPF! I'll keep using it until they stop carrying it. I never use the pump, and I just use the applicator wand. It's easy to cover my face using either a brush or a sponge. * I love this brand. I switch shades depending on how pale I'm getting. It lasts all day, and I don't have to do touch-ups throughout the day. * The coverage is beautiful for this over 70 skin, pores literally disappear even on my chin. I live in the south so sometimes the consistency is a little too thick for humidity but such an easy fix. Add a little moisturizer to the back of your hand and mix. Label says acts as concealer also. Absolutely, just a dab with the applicator and Pur perfection. * Love the coverage, couldn't tell if any was on"
18,it cosmetics,cc+ cream natural matte foundation with spf 40,pimprod2044261,2621797," * Very disappointed because this product has potential of being good if they change up their formula maybe. When first applied the coverage and quality is amazing however after long wear, product is patchy looking. * I wanted to love this product because i have a really hard time finding products that match my oliver undertone on fair skin. However, everytime I use this product I get really painful, deep cystic ance breakouts on my chin and im not normally prone to breakouts :( * Great product! * I love this foundation. It is very light but covers great. Would definitely buy again. * Like many others have mentioned as well, I used the Bye-Bye Foundation Oil Free Matte product for YEARS before it was discontinued. This product, which is claimed to be a replacement, is absolute garbage. Another loyal customer lost. * It Foundation covers every imperfection on your face. I have a very red nose because of having radiation to clear up basil cell carcinoma on my nose. It completely covers this redness and roseca on my face. Try it! * I typically use the natural finish formula of this product but wanted to switch things up for the warmer months when my skin is a little more shiny and oily. The matte version feels and works great. Just as I expected it would. However, the sunscreen scent is so much stronger! It's a bit overwhelming. Maybe I won't notice it as much in time, but my inital reaction is that they need to find a way to tone that down that scent. It's definitely not that strong in the other formulations."

20,fenty beauty by rihanna,eaze drop blurring skin tint,pimprod2031372,2592608," * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I've been using the Fenty Beauty Eaze Drop Blurring Skin Tint, and it's quickly become a staple in my makeup routine. It has a lightweight feel that blends effortlessly, giving my skin a smooth, blurred finish without feeling heavy or cakey. The coverage is light to medium, perfect for those days when I want a natural, ""my skin but better"" look. I love how it evens out my complexion while still looking fresh and breathable. My only small gripe is that it can cling to dry patches if my skin isn't prepped well, so a good moisturizer or primer is a must. So it's a beautiful, easy to wear product that delivers on its promise. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This is such a good product! The color is dark for me so I used it as a contour. I love everything fenty makes so I was so excited to use it. It is a great consistency and scent! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This is hands-down the best skin tint I've ever used! It feels incredibly lightweight, almost like I'm not wearing any makeup at all. It gives my skin a 'your-skin-but-better' finish. While the finish is a bit more matte than I prefer, mixing it with sunscreen gives me the perfect glow. My only complaint is the steep price point😭 * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I have to say I really love Fenty complexion products. These drops have a good shade range and level of coverage. I have taken them with me when traveling this summer because they are so versatile. I will be happy to repurchase these in the future. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Tried the Fenty Eaze Drop Blurring Skin Tint in shade 10, which will match even better once my summer tan fades—and I already love it. It's scent-free, super comfortable, and gives me that light, breathable coverage while smoothing out my skin. It stays put with setting spray but comes off easily with a wipe or cleanser. No irritation, no breakouts—just a great everyday base that feels amazing on my skin. * super easy to apply, buildable, and blur‑effect magic with a natural finish—this has become my go‑to for effortless, everyday perfection. Highly recommend it 💕 * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I absolutely love this tint! The coverage is FANTASTIC! It totally matches my skin tone, and leaves a very smooth looking skin effect. 
It doesn't have a bad odor or anything like that. The application is very simple due to the squeezabitlity of it...I just ""draw"" a line all over my face, and with a makeup brush I just apply it evenly. Wonderful! I'll definitely be buying another when I'm done wirh this one!"

It is hydrating, has flawless coverage, smooth snd silky to put on. I thought i would have to useca different foundation for the summer, but it still gives me the perfect amount of hydration for the summer. * I recently purchased the Morphe Lightform foundation and I must ask where has this been all my life!  I actually went into the store to get color matched for another product and changed my mind after seeing the model advertised wearing this.  The store clerk pulled (3) different shades before matching with the one I actually needed and preferred.  Actually while looking at the bottles, I picked the right shade but she wanted to try something else which turned out to be to dark for me.  The shade I needed glided on smooth and matched my skin perfectly.  So much so that it blended in perfectly with the makeup I already had on.

I also purchased a Bronzer which I am hoping will work for me.  I am getting ready for my daughters wedding and my face needs to be on point for photos!  Thank you Morphe for coming into my life. Oh not to forget, my granddaughrer swears by this product but just forgot to tell me about it.

We have a winner here! * the fondation is pretty good it is a little cakey. But it leaks so bad. Like I have to have it standing up or it will be all over the bottle * Awful coverage, break outs * THIS FOUNDATION WORKED WONDERS FOR ME AND I GOT COMPLIMENTS WHILE I USED THEM,   THEN WHEN I COULDNT FIND THEM ANYMORE AT THE STORES,  I WAS DISSAPPOINTED.  NOW I KNOW THEY ARE STILL SELLING THIS AT THIS STORE NEAR ME.  I CANT WAIT TO BUY MORE OF IT   I COULDNT COMPARE IT TO ANY OTHER FOUNDATIONS I TRIED   I REALLLY NEED TO GET BACK ON MORPHE ASAP * Bought this foundation awhile ago i usually switch foundations very often because i can never find anything that works for me or my skin, tried this foundation out a frw months ago and its my favorite thing ever ! My skin isnt perfect but this is literally like a filter for my face ! I mever write reviews but i saw how little reviews this had and was confused because it's genuinely such a good product actually noticed my skin clear up after usuing it too even my gfs noticed if you have oily skin and a hard time finding neutral shades give this brand a go ! So worth it * much too thick on mature skin"

It definitely matches my skin tone for the summer ! * Just can not beat an all day  and then plus foundation like Tarte. I recommend this foundation to anyone that wears make up and wants it to stay on * Just paints over all my redness. Got it in store so i was color matched, its very important to do that. Full coverage that lasts the entire day. This is a brand you cannot get away with just foundation, its very stong and needs blush and bronzer to make you look alive again. Otherwise, it looks unnatural. Isn't the best for dry sink, found that out cuz my dry nose would look so bad after a couple hours, switched my routine to not put any on my nose. * I would purchase this item again because it looks like I don't have any makeup on! * This item covers my face without me not looking like I 've applied make up!

To me less of a skin tint more of a super thin foundation but idk if there's a word for that. It has great coverage for how light it is, more than any skin tint I own and it doesnt slip around or disappear completely with blending. With an additional dab on my redder areas I can easily layer for fuller coverage. 

I have combo skin and it works well with my dry skin on my nose and surrounding area, I only need a hydrating primer when I'm especially dry. Usually I don't use a primer with this. This actually sets down and is soft to the touch. Still dewey though. Idk this stuff is perfect. Drugstore makeup is so dumb expensive these days but this is worth it!! * This product ruined all other foundations and skin tints for me. I prefer it to my high end complexion products. The medium/buildable coverage and skin-like satin finish are perfect for my somewhat dry skin. * I love this ""foundation"" so much. It blends so easily and it gives such a natural skin like look while also being able to cover up a lot of breakouts. Not big giant ones but little ones. * I've never been a skin tint girly, but my best friend recommended this. My life has forever been changed. The coverage and the glow? *chefs kiss* Run, don't walk!! * Felt to thick on face * This skin tint is literally your skin but better. Still provides enough coverage that is better than many CC & BB creams but literally gets absorbed into your skin. You dont feel it or see it. You will not be disappointed last the time I am at work plus a few more hours. * I mixed this with the Superstay Luminous Matte. I love the mixture. Very spreadable. This has pretty good coverage for a skin tint. I just wish it wasn't with a dropper. It does remind me a lot of the Ilia Skin Tint, but application and coverage. Overall, happy with this purchase."
28,beautycounter,skin twin featherweight foundation,pimprod2038184,2606483," * I truely like the way the foundation glides on and covers. * I had high hopes for this foundation, considering all the positive reviews, but I found it to be subpar. The smell was absolutely terrible, I found the coverage to be uneven, and after an hour or so of wear, I looked in the mirror and it really exaggerated my fine lines and pores. I for sure would not recommend this foundation to anybody over the age of 35. * This is a no for me. It smells terrible and does not work on my skin. Exaggerates dry spots, separates in oily areas, and looks cakey with any amount of product. I've tried applying with fingers, brushes, and sponges. I'm really disappointed I spent so much on it. Drugstore foundations are much better quality than this one! * This is a difficult foundation to work with, the coverage never looks even to me and it's not buildable. up close, I can see it pills on my skin if I pass the sponge over it more than a couple of times. cream products don't layer over it well - it's hard to blend cream blush, bronzer and highlighter on top and it transfers and moves all over the face. It doesn't really set down, even with powder. I have dry skin and never have issues with uneven coverage or getting a foundation to set down, with or without setting powder. I'm just not a fan, I have wet n wild, Catrice, urban decay and Pat McGrath foundations that all perform better across the cost spectrum. * This a wonderful foundation. It gives perfect coverage, making my skin look dewy and fresh.   The best part is that it is a clean product, without the bad stuff.I love this brand. * Not enough coverage for my aging skin! * Unsure. It's not like it's a bad product. I feel it's good quality. I think maybe for a lighter foundation could be a good find. I feel for the price, what my expectations were; not a good buy necessarily. Fell a bit flat for me. I've also only used a couple (2-3) times. Maybe it grows. My skin feels nice.
I don't feel excited afterwords-if that makes sense? Sometimes I put on foundation and I'm like ""OO-Hello there!"" I put this on and feel like…ehh. Best way I can put it. I did have a more positive prospective when adding a glow enhancer. It's ok."

It is perfect for a natural look. * Love the cc+ plus brand all together! Use all their products for my face & always get compliments. Nice recommendation from the store associate & overall good experience! Will buy again!! * I don't understand why all the negative reviews. first this powder is amazing, it's lightweight but you can apply more for more coverage. I FINALLY FOUND A POWDER THAT COVERS ALL THE REDNESS ON MY CHEEKS! no joke. it doesn't cause my face to look oily, no blotting sheets necessary. it lasts all day. another thing is I appreciate the small pad that comes with the powder just in case you want to reapply in the middle of the day, but the good news is I can leave my powder at home, because it lasts throughout my day. people compliment me & wonder what I am using. I buy another powder and always go back to this one. it doesn't sink into your pores and make them look huge or settle in the creases of your face, it just looks natural not a cakey powder. & no more redness. I do use the liquid foundation on some days and I love it too! can't go wrong with this powder. * I'm not super oily by any means, but this product acts like I'm an oil slick. 
I normally use the lancome pressed powder and it looks dry until alil oil mixes, then it doesn't look like makeup at all.  this powder once you apply it looks great, but after 30 minutes it's slipping and sliding around my face. any little touch to the face and it'll come right off. and don't get me started on the shade range.
so if you have super dry skin, doesn't make any oil at all, you'll be fine. everyone else find a different option. * Light feeling powder, not heavy at all * First, why is this powder packaged with an application pad (and big fat case to store it) while the instructions say to use a brush?! And even with a super light brush application, the powder sits on the skin, making it look fake and amplifying every. single. pore. I didn't think I had huge pores until I tried this to mattify my nose, only to have it make my pores look like craters covering  the surface of the moon. Yuck! I've used It Cosmetics moisturizers, foundation, concealer, and mascara for years but now I don't feel like I can trust this brand to make products that work or were designed with the customer in mind. * I like it. It doesn't break me out or bother my sensitive skin, plus the color match is pretty good. It is heavier than other powder products (ie Clinique) so it's not the one I reach for on a regular basis."
31,kvd beauty,good apple full-coverage transfer-proof serum foundation,pimprod2037872,2604570," * I really like this foundation, it is so pretty!! Lovely!! I like it so much, I bought another bottle just in case  they discontinue this. And the match was perfect! Transfer proof-check, sweat proof, check, and it feels so light on my face. I will be buying this again for sure! * This foundation to so good. I'd put it one par with Estee Lauder Double Wear. Similar but better. Looks like skin. Super light weight and give full coverage. Can't imagine what other didnt like about it. * The best foundation I've used ever. It has a skin like look and blends perfectly. You can also build on top of it really nicely. I use it for stage make up so I put a lot of layers on top and it works very nicely. * I was so let down by this foundation. I thought it would be a good fit for me since its a full coverage foundation that is supposed to feel like a serum. But it ended up looking cakey almost immediately, and 30 mins later it began to separate badly in my nose. It just looked horrible. I've tried changing up my primer, powder, etc and it's still the same. I really wanted to love it since it is full coverage, but at what cost? I cant wear it at all because I work high-end retail sales, and how I present myself at work is important. Super disappointing. I've never had this issue with a foundation before. * I keep trying other foundations but come back to this one because it has serum so not drying for mature skin is full coverage and long wearing! * Very full coverage anx decent lasting power but the foundation oxidizes like crazy, smh eventually with time making the foundation color a lot darker than when you first apply it. * I have used it before and it was great but when I ordered off line and it was delivered it was like very watery."

This is the only foundation that I have that doesnt get oily and last all day. I get complimets all the time. I think I'll go a shade lighter because it does oxidize. Make sure to use a good primer, preferably with a matte finish. * I love this foundation, i use it for my every day makeup and love the extra spf protection. Love the finish and coverage. The only con is the shade range and the lack of undertones selection. I have an olive undertone amd i have to mix 2 different shades to make it work for my skin tone. * This is a really great longwearing foundation. I find it very easy to apply evenly and it wears well throughout the day, especially when paired with a good primer and setting spray. It also sits well under other liquid or cream products. * It had so many issues. It dried down fast, was patchy, was cakey, and made me break out and my makeup never has made me breakout. * Soooo beautiful look i look like kylie jenner i swear * Honestly, I'm extremely impressed by drugstore brands. They have stepped it up, and it's showing. The coverage is great, the texture is similar to Lancôme foundation very runny and light but packed with coverage and longevity. I think its a great foundation doesn't oxidize like I thought it would. The price is great for the quality you're receiving."

I have mature skin but in no way does it cake up or look heavy * It feels really light on my skin. Love the tone and great product. * I used to love this foundation and then they changed the formula.  Now is thick and cakey.  I've been using it for years and now I have to find another foundation that won't break me out. * This has got to be the WORST foundation. I have dry skin and was looking for a 24 hour foundation that didn't break me out. This foundation separates in the first hours of wear. I regret ever buying this. * I miss the old formula just as so many others have stated in the comments. The old formula was buildable coverage and so breathable and smooth on the skin. This formula is thick and heavy, not buildable coverage (too full coverage imo), very drying on the skin, and emphasizes pores and texture. I really hope bareMinerals sees the feedback and stops making so many changes to their core skus. This foundation was my favorite but I'll be moving on from it sadly. * I was excited for a cleaner foundation with SPF. While this is a perfeft match for my skin tone (which seems so hard to find), this is streaky spotty, and settles into my pores immediately. I have tried priners, powders, etc. it also wears off so easily and transfers to everything. Not a fan and would not recommend. I will be returning this because there is no way I can stick it out and finish the bottle. It is awful. * Color was a perfect match and it initially went on great. I thought I was going to love it over the previous version but unfortunately not. Within a couple hours it looked horrible. It was particularly dry and patchy looking around my mouth. I, unfortunately had to switch brands for the first time  in over 10 years."

It doesnt seperate or cause oilness. * Overall i love the product just nit the design of the botttle. Im sure im not the only person that doesnt like to waste. I try to get as much out asvi can. But between the poor dispenser and bottle design, much is left in the bottle and is hard to get out after the pump quits dispensing. * No primer and stays pretty well all day. Need new packaging due to pump * This is my favorite. It has full cocersge but looks so natural and skin like. Wears very well throygh the day. My perfect color match as well which is hard to find since i am very fair and cool toned. * Been wanting to try this for a while & finally bought it.  I love how easy this blends.  The wear time is great as well.  Looks like I put on a filter. The packaging though coukd undergo a bit of a slight change.  Taking a cap off is not easy.  Hard to take off. * Really like the product itself. It stays on, easy to apply & gives a really natural finish. I don't notice it settling into fine lines either, which is a plus. The packaging is a mess…the pump just doesn't work. I saw several reviews mentioning this before and ignored them…but it happened to my bottle too. For the price point, I  think you can find another nice foundation with a bottle that actually works. * I love the texture and finish and that it has skincare built in! It's like a serum and a foundation all in one which is way better than other brands can say. Plus it wears well all day for me"

It's full coverage but feels light and non sticky to the touch! It's my new go to! * I have been using this product for years. The coverage is good but it feels sticky and greasy on my skin. I might search for another foundation. * I have used Clinique foundations in the past that have worked well with my skin, but this one was terrible. It started to dry the moment it touched my skin which made it very difficult to blend. Within an hour it had separated and settled into my pores. I tried using a primer first, but that did nothing to help the settling or separation. It looked terrible. I definitely would not recommend this foundation. * I got this foundation on a whim, i havent worn clinique foundation in more than a decade. And I am soooo happy I tried this. Its similar to the YSL all hours but i actually like this more. It lasts all day, and doesnt settle into lines or cling to dry spots. 10/10 recommend!! * Foundation comes off easily . * Smooth on my skin, covers my discolor age spots * I love this product. It matches and blends so well."
39,natasha denona,hy-glam powder foundation,pimprod2044289,2624364," * I bought this powder foundation after reading reviews and wish I had bought it sooner! Good coverage and doesn't settle into my pores or wrinkles like other products I've tried. Doesn't oxidize or turn orangey after a few hours of wear and last well throughout the day. This is my new go to for day to day use! * Very impressed with Natasha D makeup. Everything that I have bought I have ended up keeping from concealer, eyeshadow, lipstick and now this powder foundation. I actually use it as a finishing powder and touch ups. My routine includes starting with the IT Cosmetics CC cream and top off with this powder- you can keep layering and your skin will look beautiful!! I top off with bronzer or blush if I feel like it. The best thing is that the shades provide a natural flesh like color. * Powder foundation is just not good for nature skin .... goes in every line under my eyes * Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this powder foundation! It's so good! I was really nervous to spend this much money on it, but I was already using another expensive brand, but they were constantly out of stock with my shade for months at a time. I saw good reviews for Natasha Denonas, so I thought I'd give it a shot! Blown away! It's so much better than I was using!! It didn't make me break out at all either. I have very sensitive skin. It's not drying at all. It's like a creamy powder. It literally still looks good 8hrs after working! The only downfall is the price and it does smell a little weird. Not like perfume or anything. Just not the greatest smell. But you can't smell it once it's on, just as you're putting it on. It's also cool they have refills so you don't have to pay the 55 everytime. Overall, highly recommend! * The best powder I have ever found! * The powder is great. Doesn't make my face oily but the smell is terrible. * This powder looks really great. It is a very high price point though. I only bought it since I am in love with powder foundation. The thing is the color range for brown girls isn't that great. The color I got is a little too light. The color after this one is way too red. I am more a golden undertone. Even though the color isn't perfect on me; I will make it work with a darker contour and blend heavily. I love this powder and don't want to return it just because the color is a little off. If you are dry this powder won't work because it's even more drying in the skin."

Lightly evens out skin tone and is super hydrating and glowy. Like a super light cc cream. * Wanted to like this due to the HA but it just makes your face orange and oily.... * I have very dry, acne prone skin. I wanted to try this as it seemed like a nice, light-weight, hydrating product. This item was very oily and some how also mattifying. I also prepped my skin well and used a hydrating toner and primer. I will be returning this product. * Wow! I ended up loving this more than I thought I would. It is absolutely beautiful, evens out your skin tone perfectly. It is a tint so don't expect anything full coverage, but is it buildable so you can get decent coverage out of it. It makes your skin look plump and even. It is not too luminous and lasts a long time with powder. I use a light coverage of Fenty invisimatte powder with setting spray and it is transfer proof. I wear it alone or with a full face. I love it. The only thing is the packaging. The dropper is a huge mess, I bought a pump for it online and now it is the most perfect tint/foundation that I own. * After using this tinted serum for about a week now, I can confidently say that this is the absolute best option for those of us with fine lines! It doesn't dramatically sink into my under eye lines, it doesn't crease around my smile lines, it stays on all day regardless of what you're doing, and it blends in with my skin tone beautifully while still covering up any discoloration. The best part, you don't need setting powder to make it last all day. In fact, I found that setting powder (pressed and loose) made it look worse. It's perfect just the way it is and I hope L'oreal never stops making it. * I love this foundation so much! as someone with really sensitive skin this didn't affect me at all! I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin! * Got the lightest shade and still wasnt light enough, made me look orange not a good range of shades and not inclusive. ☹️"

I am light medium olive and use either 5.5N or 6N depending upon the time of year.  My skin is on the drier side skin but I have no issues . I do however hydrate properly. Toner or Serum, moisturizer and then the glow serum. Foundation, setting powder and setting spray, It stays well. * Checks all the boxes: 
Skin type: oily
Coverage needs: full
Longwearing: excelent 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED * I like it. My shade sent was a little too light so I mixed it with a darker color. It is creamy and provides good coverage. * Light/med shade with neutral undertone, mature skin. sadly it's separated a lot throughout the day. I'm not sure if I was using the wrong primer or my sunblock was too sheer, but I really struggled with this foundation * Unfortunately, this was one of the foundations i wanted to purchase for a long time. I finally did when it went on sale. Maybe it's my skin. But this is total failure for me. The color changes and becomes more drier. * Doesn't settle in creases moisturizing and breathable all at once and truly stars all day! * Luckily for me the shade i got was too light but the foundation definitely oxidizes so the shade ended up working. My skin looked great (too matte for my taste) BUT this foundation was so drying it made my skin feel tight. I had to douse my face in setting spray to get more of a natural finish."
43,it cosmetics,your skin but better foundation + skincare,pimprod2017112,2568683," * I'm so glad I try new things because this foundation is phenomenal. I am 60 years old and it gives me enough coverage. Also gives me a nice glow. My face looks refreshed and so much younger anyway best foundation I've tried in a long time. We'll definitely be buying again. * First  foundation that actually matched my skin, literally covers everything ans stays on, i wanted to love it but on my first try I noticed dry brown patches after I cleaned my face and  was very dry, not for me 😞 * I love this foundation, it is very lightweight so I had to use a heavy moisturizer and thick primer. It worked well with both NYX and Provedence drugstore primers.

Also my deep skin discoloration are covered with a tiny amount. I use liquid bronzer and blush with it and it pairs well with Pacifica and Maybelline liquid products. Once this foundation dries on your skin, it will break up if you add liquid or oil makeup on top- but as long as I do it all at one it sets the makeup and last for my work day. 

FYI I set my face with pixi skin veil and it wasn't too drying on my dry skin. They recommended I get a shade lighter foundation to cover and it gave me full coverage. The only con is my local Ulta doesn't sell it so I have to buy online. * this is so watery I don't even know how you're supposed to apply it. I wore it for one day and within a few hours started developing a severe rash on my skin that has lasted for several days. would not recommend. * I'm obsessed with this foundation! You don't feel like you are wearing anything! It's life changing! * This is actually a first… I've never experienced a foundation that manages to be extremely watery, yet also cakey at the same time. Unsure what kind of mystery this is, because it's certainly not a good one. Color was also extremely off and orange. Also more on the natural matte side, NOT radiant like it says. * This foundation does exactly what it says,"" Your skin but better"". Absolutely love this foundation."

I got light-medium beige and medium beige. The light-medium beige is too pale on me but the medium beige is way too yellow. The formula is also too thick and kind of cakey. I have been mixing it with a moisturizer and going heavy with a brownish-pink blush stick (abh, latte) to make it work. * I was intrigued by the name of the product and the 16 hour claim.  Glad I saw this in the store and not online, or I probably wouldn't have tried it.  So many ""all day"" products do NOT last all day.  This product is amazing!  It stays on and covers my discoid lupus lesions and redness ALL DAY!  No more reapplying or worrying about coverage! * I've been using this foundation for years! I'm 47 with combo skin and I unlocked my perfect secret to flawless foundation ~ I mix this 50/50 with the Tarte BB Tinted Moisturizer and I cannot even explain how much of a game changer this has been for me! Not too cakey, not too heavy or light, just absolutely perfect, airbrushed looking flawless skin alllllll day. It's my winning combination! * I have tried every foundation out there and this is my absolute favorite of all time - my biggest fear is it getting discontinued or if they mess with the formula. I dont have a true need for full coverage so everyone's always suprised when i tell them i wear this. My cheeks have some redness and i tend to be more dry than I am oily. Im also starting to have fine lines around my eyes and this stuff works wonders on me. I love it and I buy two each time theyre in stock just in case! A little goes a long way as well! * I LOVE LOVE LOVE this foundaion .... my sister n law in Tennessee got me started using it. * Goes on smooth  great cover for uneven skin tones   I have vitiligo  and it cover great * I have tried so many foundations priced high to low. None of them could give me the coverage or color match I was looking for. This foundation does both! It lasts all day and does break down through the day. I think I finally found my forever brand!"

When I got home my package from ulta was here,so I got myself ready with this foundation.  We went to the hospital to see my mom. My 22 year old daughter was there as well. The nurse thought she was my sister.  I mentioned that I had my son at 40 and she was shocked. She said she would've guessed 27 at the max. I was so flattered! The only thing I can think is that The foundation made me look that good. that was the only new item on me. it doesn't look like a mask. blends perfectly.  I doubt I will ever switch to a different foundation * Beautiful foundation however my skin is super sensitive and reacted to this foundation. * This is my go to for a flawless complexion! When I want the airbrushed, perfectly even skin look, and longevity for the day, through humidity, sweat, etc, this is what I choose. For a waterproof formula that is long wearing, I find this foundation to be extremely comfortable. I also appreciate that this is fragrance free and the blurring action makes my skin look so incredibly smooth. * Holy grail! Better than Armani!! * dry feeling, specifically asked for hydrating...gets chalky even after using primer and then a set spray * This makeup matches me perfectly. It feels like no other makeup I've ever used. It feels like skincare. * This is so easy and stays on all day with no touch ups! The color match was perfect! You won't even need a finishing powder but of course I use the blur powder from Laura Mercier. It is waterproof and isn't coming off until you take it off. It is very weightless.

However, even on bad application days, a couple hours later I'm always amazed by how amazing my skin looks. * This goes on light and smooth. Gives nice coverage when you want to look natural. Has SPF 30. * I needed a replacement for my favorite Les Beiges tinted SPF moisturizer by Chanel, which was discontinued :(. An ULTA assistant pointed me in the direction of Laura Mercier's tinted moisturizer with SPF, which has been great (I'm on my third tube—each has lasted me about 9 months with daily use). I like how this product lightly balances out redness, gives a subtle glow, doesn't bother my skin, and is breathable. * I'm very picky when it comes to base makeup. I have dry/normal skin, a light-medium olive skintone, and I deal with dullness/discoloration. Shade 2N1 is a good shade match for me. I've enjoyed using this with a dense foundation brush. It's easy to sheer out or build up. I would describe it as light/medium coverage. It evens out my skin tone, but doesn't cover blemishes. Its very comfortable on the skin, it feels like a moisturizer, the consistency is thick at first, but it doesn't feel like anything when blended out. I can wear it without powder and it stays on all day for me. Definitely repurchasing. * I've been using this product for years!  I don't like thick heavy coverage so this is very light buildable coverage.  I have pretty good skin, 38 years old, cheeks are pink from dryness with few blemishes and this provides me full coverage.  I do add a thin layer of moisturizer (especially now that I'm older and less oily) and concealer for under my eyes, nose and any glaring blemishes.  It's a very natural finish that does pull warm.  I use 2N1 for my winter everyday color and 2W1 for summer when I'm tanned (it's very yellow/gold). * The Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer goes on nicely,  bur doesnt cover ANY imperfections. Some pilling.  I was hoping to love it, but will be returning it."

You can use a light hand with a sponge for a skin like look like i do, or you can build it up with a brush/more product. Either way it looks so nice snd glowy but not shiny. It lasts on my dry combo skin all day when i set with a tiny bit of powder and setting spray. I try so many different foundations and i keep coming back to this one. * The serum foundation is a solid option for someone looking for coverage but not cakey coverage, which I've found with many of the other full-coverage foundations I've tried. It also feels nice on the skin, which makes sense with the serum component of the foundation. It is easy to apply with a damp sponge and lasts all day. * No foundation has ever worked well on my skin thats kinda oily but usually pretty dry. i prep my skin as always which is just with a light hydrating toner and use the elf hydra grip primer and it works so so good it lasts so long and looks so flawless, i live in a hot and humid area and it lasts so very good. never had a foundation like this. and the color match is perfect (i use NC11.5)"

It offers a stunning lightweight finish that is never cakey, even long after it has set in on your skin. One thing I really love about this product is that its lightweight qualities allow either a medium or full coverage look that is perfectly & easily buildable to your liking. It spreads on the skin easily as well and does not dry or set in too quickly. It is my favorite of all foundations by far!!!!! * I purchased this foundation with low hopes because I was not liking any of the Chanel products in the last decade and boy was I wrong! I have combo skin, used two pumps to get full coverage and was shocked by the results. Gave a soft matte finish with amazing plump, glowing looking skin. Worth the money but I will say prep your skin greatly so you can get your money's worth! * Good coverage, i got the perfect shade match, looks really great on the skin and it is lightweight. I will recommend buying this and use a good primer. * This isnt gor older women oxides after awhile on your face .nithin good in it to help skin ill be returning the bottke i pickup * I love this full cover foundation.

My skin looks incredible with it on and it applies so nicely, very light but great coverage! I dont even wear concealer with it! I put on a light moisturizer (I use Caudalie vinoperfect) and then apply the foundation with a brush. 5 stars!!! * This may be the worst foundation I've ever tried; I could not get this to apply correctly-i tried a brush, sponge and my fingers-there was just no applying this stuff.

I have normal skin and didn't experience any creasing, transfer or caking with this foundation. It would be absolutely perfect of not for the poor shade range and terrible packaging.

230 is the lightest yellow-toned shade and although I can make it work in summer with some bronzer and highlighting, it's actually a full shade darker than my natural skintone and I'm not even super pale. The brush end is also useless and a waste of packaging. For the price, I would rather have more foundation and no brush end. * I wanted a stick foundation bc that's what I was used to. When I was introduced to this, I love it!! It goes on so smooth, stays on and doesn't get oily. I have been getting it now for about 6 months. * I have used a ton of foundations through the years and they were wrong color or too greasy to cakey et etc.  This is as close to perfect as I have found.  Just make a few swipes around face, blend and you are done. I don't even use a concealer or powder.   I am slightly oily and have wrinkles.  The best I have found. * I never thought I would find a foundation that would make my older wrinkled and textured combo skin look better not worse.  I had just about given up on foundation.  It is very easy to use and best color match.   It is pricey but worth it.   It also takes the place of concealer. * My favorite foundation but you don't get enough for the price!  The foundation really covers and goes on nicely.  I'm only giving this 3 stars because it's just too expensive for the amount of product you get. I go through this very fast! * If your skin is any less smooth than glass, it will fill every pore like spackling on a wall and highlight all texture. Although it blends smoothly on smooth areas, you can see every iota of texture and every pore that the product settles into. * I though because of the brand and price it would be something i would be coming back for. But i liked nothing about this product including how it looked on skin, how it felt on the skin, how it blended, the brush that it comes with is almost worthless. I wouldnt hate this product if i didnt spend so much for what its worth."
55,lancÃ´me,teint idole ultra wear care and glow foundation,pimprod2033657,2598637," * I ordered this march 2025 and have been using it and frankly i always loved this foundation. One time it was in front of me and i noticed 2024, took me a minute to realize ive been using an expired foundation since march. I got one for my mom the same day and it expires in december 2025. Ulta should not ship products that expired or have less than a year. Really upset about it, but the foundation itself is fantastic * Awesome product. I would definitely buy this again. * I went into my local Ulta for a new shade in this foundation. I was matched up and so I purchased it. The next morning, after I had applied it, I noticed the expiration date on the bottle said ""exp. 02/2024."" I was highly upset and called customer service which they did absolutely nothing about it. Not even a discount/coupon for next purchase. I called the store and  explained the story and asked if they had some that was fresh. I was put on hold, and when the employee came back to the phone, she stated all the bottles were expired and they had to pull them. I ended up returning the product and went to Dillard's and purchased the same foundation that has an expiration date of 2027. No more Ulta purchases for me! * So i know skin tints are the current trend but as an oily girl they just never work for me. But i still wanted a lightweight matte foundation and this is it! It last all day easily without transfer and gets slightly dewy throughout the day without seperating. Ive tried more highend and drug store setting sprays with it and they all work the pretty similar witht this foundation. I got shade 405W for summer. I did try to shade match myself during the winter but 400W was way too light and the other shades werent matching my undertone. I do hope they improve their medium shade range soon because i wish i could wear this foundation year around! For reference my summer shades are usually 334 for maybelline fit me, 345 in fenty, and brule in born this way. My winter shades are usually 330 in fit me, 335 in fenty, and warm sand in born this way. * I haven't used Lancome in years. Now that I am probably 20 years older,  I wanted to go back in time to use what worked for me. I was very colorful after trying on 15 or more shades at the store by myself. I found the right one. It's amazing!!! * I'm 45 with dry skin and rosacea. This foundation looks amazing on my skin! The finish is very natural, the color is perfect, and it's long wearing. I will absolutely repurchase. * This has a gorgeous finish and goes on easily. However, the lightest shade (105W) is still too dark for fair skin and is straight up YELLOW. The 110C is still too dark but at least not yellow. Lancome should make the same shade range as the original Teint Idole foundation. I don't get it!  I recommend this foyndation, but only if yoy don't have very fair skin."

It covers my blemishes and falls on my face and pores so well. It just looks glowy and beautiful * I've been looking for a foundation that matches me and everything was always too yellow or too pink. But the L2 Olive is the first foundation that I found that matches my skin tone perfect! I have acne-prone combination skin and this foundation doesn't feel heavy on the skin and hasn't broken me out. I do feel like it does wear off throughout the day, but I also think if I built it up it would last longer. * Wanted to love this foundation but it made my skin look dry and dull, light coverage. * I bought this foundation bexause i saw it and i was intrigued with the packaging/products the brand had to offer but its just way to greasy and feels super heavy/cakey on the skin as someone who loves doing full face beats. I would say it has potential but it just wasnt my cup of tea as someone with combo skin. I think maybe for a dry skin girly this would come in clutch!! * If you love a lightweight foundation you will love this. It feels like I am not wearing anything and gives me just the right amount of coverage. The shade range is also great for me as someone with fair skin and a cool undertone. The bottle has also lasted me so long * Never sets right ive tried everything to make it work it always seems patchy or pilly on me but it might be my skins reaction because it makes my face itchy. At least its a good color match and i do like the applicatior * This foundation is soooo good; shade ranges and undertones are spot on. Coverage is so good yet light weight, I always get compliments about my make up when im wearing this foundation."
57,charlotte tilbury,charlotte's beautiful skin foundation,pimprod2043365,2619495," * This foundation is worth every penny. I love the way it goes onto the skin and it leaves your face feeling soft with a subtle glow. It's so easy to color match with numbers in each skin tone category, light, neutral, etc. I love this foundation. * So pleased with this purchase! First time buying this foundation and kind of tried it on a whim! Goes on nicely and has good buildable coverage. Very happy so far! * I was veru hopeful for this product and i have combination skin on my t zone, but somehow with this product i was very oily to the touch on my whole face and felt my skin very slick after using, goes on very well and can be buildable but unfortunately was a bad experience on my end. * I am disheartened that they changed the formula. And it did not improve the product at all. Please go back to the flawless skin result * I found this foundation in cabinet while cleaning and had forgotten all about it.  I've been wearing it on my no makeup days for a subtle glow and I'm really loving the light coverage that's buildable and how flawless it makes my skin look.  My skin just glows * This foundation is pretty and dewy but it doesn't set for anything and gets greasy super fast. Definitely not long term wear, but if youre looking for something lightweight/buildable and like the super dewy look it could work. Only super bad con is how easily it transfers on to anything one touch to the face and that spot has no foundation and its on whatever touched ur face. Makes products impossible to blend because the foundation underneath doesnt stay put. * Run dont walk mature ladies this foumdation is bluring andnflawless leaving behind a subtle flown and healthy skin"
58,dior,dior forever foundation fluid matte,pimprod2036825,2604875," * My favorite foundation. I've repurchased many times because I like the light weight formula and full coverage. It also has a pleasant smell thats not overpowering. I have oily skin and this keeps me nice and matte. * Did something change with the formula or did my skin change? It used to look beautiful on me the past 2 years, now it separates and just sits on my skin towards the end of the day; very noticeable where it is and where it isnt. Ive never had a foundation do that. Regardless if it is my skin that has has changed or the formula, the bottle continues to be terrible, squirts out everywhere, on my walls and clothes and therefore gets only 1 star for that. * Wish it worked on my skin but it doesn't! Oily/combo, used Dior velvet primer * I am 55 and have combination skin. This foundation is my favorite. Of course, I wear skincare and SPF underneath which keeps it from being too matte. I use a little setting powder in my T zone, and it lasts until I take off my makeup. I have never once had a problem with it transferring to my clothing, but I wear a light shade, so maybe the richer shade pigments are different. I have also worn this in all seasons with no issues. I will definitely repurchase. * It's been a struggle to make this foundation work on my 53yo menopausal skin. These are my tips that can make it beautiful if you have skin like mine.  Use a good but lightweight moisturizer. I found that Vanicream works best. And a hydrating primer is a must. I use Tarte Double Duty Base Tape Hydrating Primer. In my opinion, this looks better blending with your fingers instead of a brush or sponge. And use the smallest amount possible cause it goes from zero to cakey in a blink. And I would say not to use powder. Occasionally, I will use just the lightest kiss of the hourglass powder but it's a risk, and honestly it sets well without powder. I work 12 hour shifts at night so my makeup is on usually 18 hours and this stuff lasts better than anything, with only a little touchup needed at the end of the day. * I really have oil skin and this base makes my makeup look naturak but feels matte i really loke it * The foundation is amazing! It is perfect full coverage withou feeling ir kooking heavy. I have oily skin and this gives me a matte finish. Pricey but worth it!"

Last bottle I bought seemed like there was something wrong with it. It turns my fingers white and doesn't blend well and color seems off. Saw others with same complaints who said this is a new formula. Please bring old formula back or I will have to find a new foundation. * I love these foundation it stays on my face all day and I have really oily skin, I get so many compliments and it's somewhat waterproof, went swimming and it stayed on. * I love this makeup being using it for several years now. * I used this foundation for about 10 years. It was my holly grail! Went on smooth and never broke me out. However, the last bottle I purchased was nothing but a disaster. Constant break outs, it clings to any dry patches…but over all it looks extremly cakey and dry on the skin. I tried multiple different moisturizers and primers but nothing seemed to work. I then decided to look into it and read that the formula had been changed. How unfortunate…I went out and purchashed a completely different foundation of another brand that has given me no problems. I would NOT recommend this foundation. * It was perfect!! I'm buying it for all of my friends * I don't know if I'm not doing something right, but it definitely doesn't give you smooth coverage. It looks dry, flakey, and inconsistent. I used primer and my sponge was wet. I also tried doing it without primer with a wet sponge, and also a dry sponge with no luck. Super disappointed that a bottle of decently expensive foundation is going to waste 😭. The only pro of this is foundation is that it doesn't cause acne. * A great color match. Easy on my acne prone skin. So glad this product is available. A dream come true for me. Also covers up roscea like magic. I have a darker version for the summer months. This color I am writing about will get used when there isn't much sun in Ohio."

No irritation on my sensitive skin. I can't feel it, and actually forgot to wash it off one night.. no acne or irritation the next morning.  No dryness * Does not wear well regardless of the type of primer or setting powder I used. It didn't last more than 2 hours. This is genuinely the worst product I've used in a while. I wanted to like it so much but it just wore terribly. Product was silky and smooth * I use this when I travel. It has great coverage and melts beautifully into my skin. I have VERY textured, mature, combo/oily skin, and it looks amazing. I use a dry sponge to spread it, dust on powder and it lasts all day. * I love it look so natural * I did not realize this was more of a skin tint when I bought it, works wonderfully nevertheless! I usually gravitate towards foundation sticks because they're workable and clean to use, and this product is exactly that. Easy to apply and get light-to-medium coverage. If you are looking for full coverage, THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT. However, I do love using this product in the summer because it feels comfortable on the skin! * I have been using this foundation since it came out.  I LOVE it.  It gives a nice natural look.  I receive so many compliments stating that my skin is so smooth and beautiful.  I also use Fenty skin care so it could be a combination of great skin care products (which is most important), and a great foundation stick."

Keeps my skin looking healthy and  covers perfectly! * gorgeous glow and decent coverage, one of my favorite foundations i have ever tried * I love how this foundation gives a natural glow without looking greasy.

I'm 64 yo with dark spots on my face and pretty big pores.  I tried a full coverage foundation, but it felt sticky and clogged my pores causing breakouts.  So, went to Ulta to check on a medium coverage foundation.  I loved the different tints that Fenty Beauty had, so I decided to buy it.  This foundation went on smoothly (I used a brush) and gave good coverage of my dark spots.  It feels soft and is not cakey or sticky.  I bought shade 150, which looks good, but I probably could've went to 175 or 185, especially for evening and for summer months when my face gets more color to it.  I put on primer or a light moisturizer before applying with a brush, which helps to minimize my pores.  I do have a setting powder that helps to further minimize pores.  This foundation does not feel greasy or is it overly moist-appearing."

Did not blend seamlessy into skin with brush or sponge. And oxidises. * Complimentary from hourglass I am very happy with this tinted moisturizer. It is perfect to wear in the summer months because it does not rub off. I really think this is also perfect for acne prone skin because it does not irritate me at all. * I recently was gifted by Hourglass their Veil Hydrating Skin Tint and I love it. It has such a natural finish and blends into my skin flawlessly. I have replaced my foundation and use this on my more casual days * I absolutely love this skin tint.

It doesn't stay on if I want to travel with it in my makeup bag, and I've dropped the bottle by picking it up by its 2.5""lid several times.   Packaging needs work.   I'd only refer it to a friend with the warning about poor ability to close it and keep the pump sanitary. * I liked this foundation a lot! It matched my skin tone really well, and is a really affordable price. It's a nice size, and usually lasts me over four months to finish. The only bad thing is that it takes a while to blend in and I find myself having to go over it with a beauty blender or brush a lot. I do still really like it though and it covers up many imperfections. * The best foundation ever!!!!!! * Patchy, greasy , I was disappointed ☹️ * Great price so, I thought to give it a try. It's not a bad foundation but not one that squeals excitement. Blends pretty well but after a while it seems to pool into lines and makes imperfections noticeable. Would probably be a good product for dry skin * I like how it blends out and has the perfect coverage for everyday use. * I like how it blends out and has the perfect coverage for everyday use."

One of my good friends died, and the funeral was half inside an old church/ half outside in 98 degree weather (honestly was hotter under the tarpes somehow).

I did a little research and read about it tending to run dry. I moisturized extra the night before and the morning of. Additionally, I made sure the primer I used was silicone based to match the foundation. It worked GREAT. I cried so much that day. and that night. and the days after. and earlier today.  You get the point.

If you ensure proper ""before care"" and use the correct type of primer, there's a great chance it works for you.

However, I ended up putting a hat on outside once we left the church and where the hat touched the makeup was melted off in chunks of sweaty cool toned light foundation. I didnt use any powder (just all nighter setting spray) to avoid being extra dry. When I looked in the mirror that night, it held up so very well given the circumstances. * This foundation is PERFECT for us oily girls. The dry down is perfect and blends perfectly without looking caked on. It's the perfect summer foundation. * This does absolutely nothing!  For the price, you get no shine, no color literally it's like you have nothing on. Don't waist your money. * Bought this on sale for half off as I was looking for a long lasting foundation. I usually wear the lightest shade in foundations, but this one was so light it was almost white. Since it waterproof it dries very quickly. It clung to my texture even after skin prep. * This makeup is amazing. It matches up with Too Face Fenty Becca Este Lauder Lancome 
I like natural the whole night even danced all night. Didn't need to touch up the only thing i touched up was my lipstick. This product just needs to be be put in a bigger bottle especially for everyday use I'll have to stock up so i don't get blind sided and it gets discontinued. * Love the coverage, but it tends to cling to any dry spots I may have and creases pretty bad around the eyes and mouth/ chin. It starts to look splotchy after about 8 hours of wear, even with setting spray"
66,jane iredale,purepressed base mineral foundation refill,pimprod2033383,2595091," * I have been using this for almost 25 years, nothing can beat it. It was originally created by a plastic surgeon for her patients after surgery at her practice. Then it made it's way to estheticians and finally retail.  The coverage is fantastic. I live in Florida's heat and humidity and it stands up to it perfectly. I personally believe the sunscreen has helped me to keep the sun damage at bay as well. I saw a review that said it had sparkles. I have never seen that in all this time. Perhaps it was confused with the BM label??? I use the Real Techniques powder sponge (the one thats super light and airy) as it does not come with an applicator. Also it does not come in a compact. My suggestion is to try it and then purchase theirs after you fall in love with it or decide it is not for you. I have had my current compact for about 6 years and it is easy to pop in the next refill. There is a little hole in the back that is about the size of a paper clip tip and you can just push it out. There is a magnet that holds it in place. It really does save on throwing everything in a landfill. It finishes beautifully with PS On Till Dawn setting spray. I will say that as my skin has ""matured"" I do not try to use as much as my skin is drying up. BTW i use it as a setting powder , hence the trying to back off some as i have aged, but it is great as just a foundation too. Hope this review helps. This stuff is like a secret miracle. (I dont work for them. My friend was an esthetician and turned me on to it as I am a long time makeup fan) * It doesn't say that the product has sparkles - I don't do sparkles on foundation, it looks childish. Also, the finish is not ""skin-like"" but very mate. That's a no for me. * This stuff feels like you have nothing on your face and doesn't irritate my super sensitive skin at all. The light beige is the best color match I've ever had for my cool skin tone. The only drawback is I wish it wasn't so expensive. * Love this product. Light weight. Comfortable and covers nicely. Just blurs the imperfections without looking like a mask. I have freckles so this is perfect. * Giving this 5 stars even though I will be returning it. I recently figured out that I am sensitive to Zinc Oxide sunscreen, which explains why this broke me out, even though its ingredients are so minimal and acne safe. I got itchy and developed a few pimples from wearing this. HOWEVER! This is an amazing foundation, and I am so upset that it has to leave my collection. It's a powder, but it's almost creamy on the skin and blurred the flaky texture on my cheeks. The coverage was a perfect medium but could be built up. I am combination dry and acne prone, and without the zinc oxide, this would've been my forever foundation. * I never thought I'd become a powder foundation girl, but I'm obsessed with this foundation! It blends so well, I have oily, textured, fuzzy haired skin and always stayed away from powder foundations, until I couldn't take the oily mess from liquid foundations anymore and gave this one a try! My eyes are very sensitive, and I was baffled my how much I loved this foundation. I apply over my moisturizer and lasts all day.

Only cons: can't color match at Ulta stores, and a bit pricey - but so worth it! * I've used this makeup for years. I love that it is light buildable coverage with SPF protection."

Well my normal 2 foundations look great all day, pores look normal. The Dior lasted a couple hours before creeping all in my pores- making them stand out too much. Don't recommend if u have somewhat large pores.. mine r like medium craters w/ no makeup- lol * I have been using this for over 2 years now and love the dewy look and that it's buildable. Blush, powder, and concealer goes over it perfectly. It does oxidize and has an odd smell though. To me it doesn't smell like fragrance, but more like a chemical smell such as alcohol. For the price point, I think I will be researching alternatives. * Inloce a foubdation that guves a natural finish (not too matte, not shiny) and a bit of a ""radiant"" look with lightvreflecting sheen (but not some ghastly psychedelic prism effect). 

Based in thecdescriotion, inhooed this fitvthe above. It dies not. It keaves a shiny finish that is a bit ""sticky"" to the touch. I dud not care for it. I have nornal skin, perhaps occasionally (winter) on the dry side. * I have tried working with this product in sooo many ways and no matter what it becomes textural, dry, and patchy. Its just plain ugly. Ive never experienced anything like it. I also never leave reviews but after many months of trial and disappointment, I felt compelled to tell you to save your money. Love Dior generally good grief * A makeup artist applied this shade and it looked identical to my Cool tone pale skin. I was given a sample and used it at home. The color faded and turned out whiter than my skin tone. Half of my face was white and the other side was my natural pale skin with rosacea. Applied to entire face and I see streaks on my cheeks and it doesn't set well with Setting spray. I wanted to love this but its not giving me a natural dewy finish or the same color match. Too white! * This is actually the worst foundation I've ever used. I don't understand any positive reviews?? Cakey, oxidized, and hard to wash off. My skin looked more even and glowy before I put this junk on. Dior should stick to making handbags."

I had to leave Mac and find something else. This new ""remastered"" foundation is cakey, settles into every pore and line on my face and separates into greasy clumps!

72,l'orÃ©al,infallible 24h fresh wear foundation in a powder,pimprod2021871,2575170," * I used it one day and loved it,  but next day when I opened it all the powder started falling out, it started with just one part but now all the powder base is complety ""broken"" I can use it but very carefully and unable to carry it with me :( * Dont order for shipment. Just received mine & powder all overbox. Ordered 2 due to a bogo deal. Both busted. Not at clise ulta stores so guess im driving 10 miles out of my way to get replacement tomorrow. This is the 4th time this has happened w/ pallettes over last few years. Figure this out ulta!!!! * I'm so disappointed. I was looking forward to having the matching powder and it came in completely busted up and shattered * I tried this for the summer as setting powder. It works well, stays on all day and I'm not completely oily/cakey after 10+ hours of wear. * I really like the powdered foundation and it was good in the beginning. Has a mice smell. Has mirror but i wish it came with a sponge to apply the foundation. It also started falling apart within a month and became loose powder at this point. I am a little disappointed about that becasue it works really well untill it started falling apart on me:( * I'm dark skin with neutral undertones. Color match was great. Good coverage, goes on smooth. Doesn't cake or crease. * Since my review a month ago, I started wearing a light amount of this powder foundation over tinted moisturizer. It really looks nice. It is not dry or flat looking at all. I use a fluffy, flatish blush brush to lightly powder my entire face.  My face has a nice glow. I recommend."
73,chanel,les beiges water-fresh tint,pimprod2030055,2574253," * This is my first Chanel product I have tried and it is amazing. The coverage is sheer and its perfect for summer. You can apply it so many different ways and continue to build to the coverage you would like. One of my new favorite products. * I would but again * Absolutely stunning on the skin. No, I don't like the price - but NOTHING is better than this. This is by far the best base product in my collection. It is very light coverage, but it just evens out your skintone in such an ethereal way. Perfection. * At first I could not believe how much this costs for doing so little haha. why even bother it doesn't cover anything? definitely not for the girl with rough skin. But it actually is lovely. I grew to love it for natural looks * If you are looking for medium or full coverage, you will be incredibly disappointed. If you have great skin and only need a little help evening out, this is perfect. I recommend doing your research before buying. Look at the negative reviews, and see what other products that user also reviewed negatively. Solely based on their previous purchases and feedback, this was never the product for them. The one and two star reviews are misleading. The description is spot on, this is intended for a sheer to light, radiant coverage and provides just that. It's intended to enhance skin that needs minimal help. This is a great product, when used as directed. * OMG. This is it. This is the holy grail. I have been searching forever for a light, airy, barely there foundation that won't cake on my dry skin and make me look older than I am. And I found it. As long as it doesn't break me out I will be in heaven. * This is exactly what I've been searching for. Something easy to throw on that doesnt feel heavy. Super easy to work with"
74,clinique,even better refresh hydrating and repairing makeup foundation,pimprod2004194,2541677," * This foundation is such great quality and lasts all day and the best part is its good for your skin and helps wirh hyperpigmentation its so great ! * This is the foundation that me & my family all wear. Clinique has no other foundation with full coverage & a natural finish. I'm so bummed I'll have to find a foundation to use in a different brand. * Love this foundation for my combination skin. * I won't even allow this product to come near my face. It contains an astonishing TWELVE separate forms of silicone (including dimethicone as the 2nd ingredient, following water). This has more silicone than most silicone-based face primers, so if this is what you are seeking, just buy a cheap silicone-based primer and powder; I think you'd end up with a similar result. Even with all it's additives, it still lacks sunscreen (chemical or physical), although the thought of adding sunscreen to this already pore-stifling mixture makes my face sweat just thinking about it.

With a name like Clinique, we except you to formulate proceducts with skin-loving ingredients. Cosmetics companies can no longer get away with adding whatever cheap ingredients they wish in order to achieve the façade of temporarily healthy skin. Consumers have educated themselves and we know too much now.

Do better, Clinique. * Great product * I had high hopes for this foundation since it was described as for very dry mature skin.  Nope, too thick, wrong color choice (my mistake), no matter how lightly I applied it still caked in creases & wrinkles. * Easy application and coverage."
75,kvd beauty,good apple skin-perfecting hydrating foundation balm,pimprod2022990,2577085," * This has been my everyday product for over five years. There is not a day where I don't use it, I have been using it as my bronzer. There's nothing like this in my opinion. I have sensitive skin and I'm prone to break out and this has never made me break out. I have gotten many of my friends on it. You won't regret it! * This is my foest review ever. I felt compelled to share my experiance with this product. First im a makeup artist and esthetician. Im Picky when it comes to my clients, and of course my own makeup. When I say i have tried every foundation under the sun, i sincerley mean it. From extreme high end, department store, spa grade, boutique brand, indie brand, drug store etc, you name it and ive either tried it or worked with it. This foundation right here checked ALL my boxes. I am oily but dehydrated on my face. I bought this a while back and used it once and put it in my back of my vanity!  Went back to estee lauder. My makeup got to where i just was not pleased with the look of my makeup so i said ill give kvd another try because i see all the youtubers working with creams so i said what the heck. After learning the correct skin prep and correct tool for this forumulation i can say i am very VERY well pleased with this product. I have textured creapy creasy pores etc and this product make my skin look perfected in everyway. Played great with all my other products as well. I used all nighter setting spray to lock this product in and it wore for 11 hours in 104 degrees nc heat and still looked great before i removed it. Very very well pleased. I will be buying a back up and all other kvd products! * Not sure why I didn't keep using this. It's perfect for my elderly dry skin, goes on smoothly, spreads easily. Plan to continue for sure. * As a practical makeup girly- this is a product I have purchased back to back. I absolutely love the flawless look it gives me. I'm 35 years old with oily skin, I use this for my everyday, corporate job, natural look. * You only need a little bit, but this is the best for my aging, dry skin. * Provided full coverage for my textured skin, pores, blemishes, and hyperpigmentation. Can skip concealer. Lasted all day during summer heat and humidity * I wore this when i went to work yesterday-it lasted all day and i was outdoors from 8am-2pm. Then i still left it on throughout the day to see if it would get ugly, i took a nap once i was home, then i went to the park at about 10 pm, got home at 11 pm, my base makeup still looked pretty. No creases, and it didn't get oily for me. Definately recommend. I just don't really like that it doesn't really look like it has much product in the packaging."
76,chanel,les beiges healthy glow foundation hydration and longwear,pimprod2030080,2571508," * Ehh I wouldn't repurchase, it's pretty and wears nicely throughout the day but the cons outweigh the pros to me. I need complexion products that work with other complexion products and this does not do that. * This is one of the best foundations I've ever used. I usually attend a cycling class during lunch, take a quick shower, and head straight back to the office without reapplying makeup. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the foundation still looked flawless and radiant on my skin. I absolutely loved it. * Really like Aqualumiere, but wanted a bit more coverage. Performance was the opposite of marketing claims - cakey, drying, felt heavy, accentuated texture and looked like makeup. The cool shade was orange, which is actually a warm color. Returned. * Is oily and emphasis every texture and pore on my face, it has fragance that lasted all day and my skin texture looked worse than when I dont use make up will be returning * Goodbye foundation.  Mixed with sai chefs kiss * Beautiful finish, glides on smoothly with just the right amount of coverage. * It was soo good. I thought it was going itch my face because some foundation be making my skin red but this one did not do anything it worked really good."

I like the coverage and SPF! I'll keep using it until they stop carrying it. I never use the pump, and I just use the applicator wand. It's easy to cover my face using either a brush or a sponge. * I love this brand. I switch shades depending on how pale I'm getting. It lasts all day, and I don't have to do touch-ups throughout the day. * The coverage is beautiful for this over 70 skin, pores literally disappear even on my chin. I live in the south so sometimes the consistency is a little too thick for humidity but such an easy fix. Add a little moisturizer to the back of your hand and mix. Label says acts as concealer also. Absolutely, just a dab with the applicator and Pur perfection. * Love the coverage, couldn't tell if any was on"

Very natural appearance, covers slight imperfections even with a light application. Very comfortable on skin even in the ungodly heat of summer. * FINALLY a perfect color match for my pale skin!
Hydrating, but not in a heavy way! * It's been such a journey finding a formula and shade that works for me. I'm absolutely in love with this foundation and its build-ability and find myself doing my make up more often because of it * a great foundation * This is my favorite foundation! Definitely worth your money. I have dry skin and this foundation hydrates while not leaving too much of a dewy finish. Would recommend!! * Its truly a beautiful foundation, very light weight however it does not cover my acne scars 😩 ive tried to built it up as well.

You get the no-makeup makeup look effortlessly. I don't use a brush or sponge to apply, just my fingers, and a dime size covers my face. I got lucky; I stocked up before y'all sold it out! Yet, I'm glad you all found something that fits well! * Great color and application however through out the day starts to leave my skin a little greasy. * I've bought this twice now , trying to get it to work for me. I've used it with primer, no primer, fingers, sponge, brush. Its always peels and looks terrible. I'm pretty knowlegable when it comes to makeup and I've used alot of different foundations. I love Chanel and love some of their other foundation, but not this one. * I've been wearing this for 4 years and will never buy another.  It goes on light and easy, adds a nice luminous glow to my skin and provides even and light coverage. * Thank goodness ULTA Carrie's this now!! The ONLY foundation that does NOT settle in your fine lines and I have mega lines still doesn't settle, I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION, please chanel never discontinue this! * I love how my skin feels with this Chanel foundation it looks and feels so smooth. I've been using it for five years now. * I've literally tried 5 foundations in the last 2 months all claiming to do the same thing. I have acne scars very large pores deep smile lines that collect the makeup.... And I'm 53. All the nightmares!!!!  This foundation!!!  I mean common!!!  It covered everything!  It blurred the pores on my nose, which nothing ever has, it didn't settle it those deep lines, even the ones in the corner of my mouth!!!  I looked Dewey all day!  I felt like I was wearing nothing. It wasn't even the right shade cause they were out but I just used a bit of bronzer and omg perfection!!  I will never ever use anything else.

It goes on smooth and doesn't feel cakey.  It's not drying like most tinted moisturizers.  It has more of a matte finish, I prefer a little shimmer (like the Bare Minerals tinted moisturizer).  This one doesn't last all day but is still a good tinted moisturizer with SPF 25.  A little pricey for the size so I would only buy it with a coupon. * I have normal to dry at time skin… I have tried every method to apply this and nothing works.

The packaging is pretty standard compared to other all in one tinted moisturizer with SPF. I received the color fair, which was a little yellow for my skin tone. I swatched it on my cheek, it wasn't quite so yellow once blended into my skin, but if you look closely at the photos after blending, it did not apply smoothly and enhanced my pores and facial jaw lines. Almost immediately. This was a bit of a bummer because I had been looking forward to trying this product because I like multifunctional makeup. It also contains talc, which from what I understand is a debated topic currently. I tried to avoid talc containing products because if there's a chance of mesothelioma, I just don't want to take any unnecessary risks when there are similar products on the market, talc-free. I find it a bit suspicious that companies have started swapping l talc for other ingredients like in products like baby powders. So I have heard it is generally not recommended for application to the genital areas as there is some risk. 
I'd just rather not put an ingredient like that on my face or near my eyes or mouth. I wonder if one day we'll find out it was indeed harmful. In companies I've known this all the time, but took very slow action to remove talk from their newer products. I really wish that companies would be more transparent with things like this. However, these situations have repeatedly occurred throughout history so I decided to inspect my makeup. I have a lot of make up so it took a long time, but I found three big boxes full of very expensive makeup that all contained talk. It is especially where I'm around my eyes as it's a mucus membrane. I am hesitant to apply despite my love for a more than a few of my beautiful eyeshadow palettes and facial powders. 
I wish companies would let us trade in the to containing items for their new tile free products! It happens with recalls in the grocery store. I a girl can only dream…

It doesnt seperate or cause oilness. * Overall i love the product just nit the design of the botttle. Im sure im not the only person that doesnt like to waste. I try to get as much out asvi can. But between the poor dispenser and bottle design, much is left in the bottle and is hard to get out after the pump quits dispensing. * No primer and stays pretty well all day. Need new packaging due to pump * This is my favorite. It has full cocersge but looks so natural and skin like. Wears very well throygh the day. My perfect color match as well which is hard to find since i am very fair and cool toned. * Been wanting to try this for a while & finally bought it.  I love how easy this blends.  The wear time is great as well.  Looks like I put on a filter. The packaging though coukd undergo a bit of a slight change.  Taking a cap off is not easy.  Hard to take off. * Really like the product itself. It stays on, easy to apply & gives a really natural finish. I don't notice it settling into fine lines either, which is a plus. The packaging is a mess…the pump just doesn't work. I saw several reviews mentioning this before and ignored them…but it happened to my bottle too. For the price point, I  think you can find another nice foundation with a bottle that actually works. * I love the texture and finish and that it has skincare built in! It's like a serum and a foundation all in one which is way better than other brands can say. Plus it wears well all day for me"

Never had this problem before and I won't risk it again by continuing to use only Estee Lauder products. They are too expensive for that level of abysmal customer serivce. * This is one of the worst skin tints ive used 😅. Ar first I thought it looked great, I tried my usual routine that should've worked with this product, but about 20 mins after I finished my makeup it looked cakey, patchy, and just overall gross. It also oxidized several shades darker so I looked ridiculous all day with an oompa loompa face and white neck 🙃.

Beautiful full coverage without a caked on look or feeling. * I've been struggling to find a serum foundation that matches my skin tone. They're all either too dark or too light. I figured I'd try a more expensive one and hope for the best. I am fairly disappointed. While the color matches great, the dropper use basically just aesthetic because it doesn't work at all. The foundation when applied and spread it pills and doesn't spread very well at all. * I got this because I think EL double-wear is gods gift to makeup. I'm very disappointed in the skin tint :/"

It is hydrating, has flawless coverage, smooth snd silky to put on. I thought i would have to useca different foundation for the summer, but it still gives me the perfect amount of hydration for the summer. * I recently purchased the Morphe Lightform foundation and I must ask where has this been all my life!  I actually went into the store to get color matched for another product and changed my mind after seeing the model advertised wearing this.  The store clerk pulled (3) different shades before matching with the one I actually needed and preferred.  Actually while looking at the bottles, I picked the right shade but she wanted to try something else which turned out to be to dark for me.  The shade I needed glided on smooth and matched my skin perfectly.  So much so that it blended in perfectly with the makeup I already had on.

I also purchased a Bronzer which I am hoping will work for me.  I am getting ready for my daughters wedding and my face needs to be on point for photos!  Thank you Morphe for coming into my life. Oh not to forget, my granddaughrer swears by this product but just forgot to tell me about it.

We have a winner here! * the fondation is pretty good it is a little cakey. But it leaks so bad. Like I have to have it standing up or it will be all over the bottle * Awful coverage, break outs * THIS FOUNDATION WORKED WONDERS FOR ME AND I GOT COMPLIMENTS WHILE I USED THEM,   THEN WHEN I COULDNT FIND THEM ANYMORE AT THE STORES,  I WAS DISSAPPOINTED.  NOW I KNOW THEY ARE STILL SELLING THIS AT THIS STORE NEAR ME.  I CANT WAIT TO BUY MORE OF IT   I COULDNT COMPARE IT TO ANY OTHER FOUNDATIONS I TRIED   I REALLLY NEED TO GET BACK ON MORPHE ASAP * Bought this foundation awhile ago i usually switch foundations very often because i can never find anything that works for me or my skin, tried this foundation out a frw months ago and its my favorite thing ever ! My skin isnt perfect but this is literally like a filter for my face ! I mever write reviews but i saw how little reviews this had and was confused because it's genuinely such a good product actually noticed my skin clear up after usuing it too even my gfs noticed if you have oily skin and a hard time finding neutral shades give this brand a go !

And it lasted the full 12HRs!!!! * This was my favorite foundation for a while now but my shade has dissappeared…really dissappointed. Why is 2N1 just gone? * I've tried three of four BB creams, sheer foundations, etc. Two of which broke me out in hives and one that was just plain awful. I came across this, and figured I'd try it since I like the original Double Wear foundation. I love this! It's lightweight, evens my skin tone, has SPF in it, and has decent coverage. Plus, it does not break me out! Will definitely purchase this again. * This ""foundation"" gives no coverage and it's so watery. I put it on my face and immediately wiped it off. I wanted a lighter feel than double wear foundation but it's horrible. * This foundation is terrible. It has no coverage and never dries. You will walk around sticky all day, which I hate, but you may not mind. It was sticky and wet even after setting with powder. I will be returning it. * This foundation does give light coverage, but it gives a beautiful satin finish that lasts all day. It is meant to be sheerer than the original Double Wear, and shouldn't be compared to that. This is a little more than a skin tint that doesn't leave your face feeling sticky. It dries down nicely, feels weightless and is perfect if you don't want full coverage. I hope this formula is never discontinued! * This is definitely one of my favorite foundations I've ever used.

Super easy to shade match, excellent coverage with our getting ""cakey"". It reminds me of It Cosmetics Foundation but a fraction of the price. Love this product!"
90,urban decay cosmetics,hydromaniac tinted moisturizer,pimprod2021082,2567739," * For both my summer and winter shade this blends so easily with my skin, great for neutral undertones. Covers dark spots with no concealer. Great medium coverage that can be built up. Perfect for ppl looking for a stand alone hydrating foundation with a little more coverage than a BB or CC cream. * I have been wearing this at least 5 days a week for the last 4 years so I can confidently say I will be purchasing again. I wear my makeup for 12-14 hours and this lasts ALL day, has a lovely dewy finish and is very build able. * i'm super picky and look for products with 100 skin score because i have mild acne and rosacea. i somehow ended up trying this even though it is 90 not 100. but i keep buying it, goes on great on top of my super goop spf and has great coverage * This gives such a pretty finish! It doesn't have SPF so I put my normal SPF underneath and it doesnt affect the dewy finish. I'm almost 48 and I love the way this makes my skin look! Perfect for summer. * Doesnt blend well with sunscreen and has no spf! Otherwise does build and wears comfortably. I use it on top of other foundation as a hi liter for a glowy finish in some areas. But cannot use as a foundation. It is overpriced also. * Urban Decay Foundation is the best foundation I've used & continue to buy. It light & has amazing coverage! Ladies go get you some!! * Lightweight , glides on with ease . Great summertime product ,offers just enough coverage without feeling made up ."
91,estee lauder,futurist hydra rescue moisturizing foundation spf 45,pimprod2013152,2577966," * Applies on smoothly. My skin is changing, ugh perimenopause!!! I'm falling back in love with my skin using this product. * This really is a pretty foundation. I bounce a damp Beauty Blender to blend it over my face and neck.  I don't recommend more than one pump, because it can look heavy if more is used.  It has light reflection properties like Nars Light Reflecting (another favorite of mine), and it can look a bit ghostly in the right(wrong) light.  In Double Wear, I've worn Desert Beige and figured it would be an identical shade in Futurist, but it's not, and I think it's the light reflecting ingredients that make it lighter.  Fortunately, Desert Beige in Double Wear is now too dark for me, so this shade in Futurist is working pretty well.  Also, I've noticed that this foundation can separate and cling too dry patches if I  over-hydrate under it.  I will repurchase this foundation when I run out. * I've been searching for the right foundation for my maturing skin for awhile. My go-to drug store brands just weren't cutting it anymore and I've been so tired of the orangey tinge that I'm left with.  Even after trying a few of the nicer brands, I was still left with the orangey oxidation/dry down.  
I had read reviews on this brand & there were many that highly suggested it. When I had been in store, I finally asked an associate what they recommend for mature skin & they led me to this. They matched my tone & I was excited to give it a go. She asked if I needed concealer and I declined because I usually just build my foundation around as one. I have my new foundation a shot & I absolutely loved it. It's buildable for those problem areas. My only problem was I wasn't thinking when I purchased that this has SPF (45 SPF) and if you're using it too close to your eyes, it will leave them burning/irritated. Needless to say, that's where my problem areas are & I build more heavily around the eyes. My eyes were watering so bad. I didn't want to return the foundation because I loved it so much so I ended up going back for the concealer.  It all works so perfectly together and I'm no longer dealing with trying to blend in orangey make up lines. This foundation dries down and doesn't change shades.  I highly recommend! * Estée Lauder Double Wear was too heavy for me. Futurist Hydra Rescue is perfection. It's lightweight, covers redness better than IT products & color match is exceptional. I used IT for years but from now on I'm using this! * One of my go to foundations for day to day. This foundation has SPF 45 and is very hydrating. It does transfer which can get a bit annoying but thats because it contains sunscreen and hylauronic acid. * All ladies should own this! Applies on smooth, lasts all day and makes my skin look flawless!! * All of Estee Lauder's foundations are really great."

I've tried many viral foundations and always find myself coming back to this one. I just finished my second bottle and no doubt will be purchasing my third! * Broke the first time I used it. * Blends perfectly. Looks like second skin. A little goes a long way. Clearly higher end and well made, lives up to the luxury that is Chanel. This is the best purchase I have ever made In my entire life. * I love the ingredients but the color format is poor .. * If you are a ""no makeup"" makeup wearer, you will love this foundation. It provides light blurring coverage with a natural finish. In the attached photo, I am not wearing primer. The wear time is half a day or so before I felt that it had really worn off. I will use it for light days, but do not plan to repurchase as I have other foundations I have tried that I felt worked better for me. * Worth every penny! Love this foundation! * I have been using this foundation for a few months now and it has not disappointed.  Yes, it's pricey but dang it's worth it!  I am 59 and finding a foundation that covers and not look gross is really hard.  SO yes, finding one even at this price that does, is worth it to me   I save up my points and use that to offset the price as needed"

😊 * Goes on smooth and light and stays put. Definitely a great foundation. * It looked k natural * This foundation is great for older skin. It goes on smooth and lasts all day. The color L30N matches my skin perfectly. * Is this going to live up to the discontinued Studio Skin 24hr? I don't think anything will, and I was hesitant to try this out due to a lot of negative reviews. I'm very pleased with the coverage, longevity (oily skin), and shade range! * I was honestly not going to buy this based on the reviews, but I did anyway because this has a fair olive shade which is difficult to find. this foundation is a great match for a pale neutral-warm olive, and it feels like im not wearing makeup (sensory friendly). 

I am allergic to a lot of makeup but not this. it did not cause my acne prone skin to break out. * Let me tell you I have tried a  million foundations and this one leaves your skin glowing ! No oxidizing not too oily but not to too drying 
Please DONT discontinue !!"
95,maybelline,super stay 24h skin tint + vitamin c,pimprod2039657,2610817," * This is my new favorite go to for every occasion, casual or more full glam. To me less of a skin tint more of a super thin foundation but idk if there's a word for that. It has great coverage for how light it is, more than any skin tint I own and it doesnt slip around or disappear completely with blending. With an additional dab on my redder areas I can easily layer for fuller coverage. 

I have combo skin and it works well with my dry skin on my nose and surrounding area, I only need a hydrating primer when I'm especially dry. Usually I don't use a primer with this. This actually sets down and is soft to the touch. Still dewey though. Idk this stuff is perfect. Drugstore makeup is so dumb expensive these days but this is worth it!! * This product ruined all other foundations and skin tints for me. I prefer it to my high end complexion products. The medium/buildable coverage and skin-like satin finish are perfect for my somewhat dry skin. * I love this ""foundation"" so much. It blends so easily and it gives such a natural skin like look while also being able to cover up a lot of breakouts. Not big giant ones but little ones. * I've never been a skin tint girly, but my best friend recommended this. My life has forever been changed. The coverage and the glow? *chefs kiss* Run, don't walk!! * Felt to thick on face * This skin tint is literally your skin but better. Still provides enough coverage that is better than many CC & BB creams but literally gets absorbed into your skin. You dont feel it or see it. You will not be disappointed last the time I am at work plus a few more hours. * I mixed this with the Superstay Luminous Matte. I love the mixture. Very spreadable. This has pretty good coverage for a skin tint. I just wish it wasn't with a dropper. It does remind me a lot of the Ilia Skin Tint, but application and coverage. Overall, happy with this purchase."
96,l'orÃ©al,true match super-blendable foundation,pimprod2034733,2602421," * this foundation has been out for a while. I decided on a whim to give it a try.

I have dry skin, but I do a lot of skin prep before applying make up, and this is amazing.

I was skeptical cause I normally go for hydrating foundations... but this did really well for me- and at half of the cost of other foundations I have used. * I purchased this foundation from an article that highly recommended it as one of the top foundations for aging skin. In fact, this is one of the top foundations NOT to wear if you have aging skin. It will showcase and emphasize every line ir crease on your face and it also leaves a very greasy appearance. It's terrible it creases and it makes you look much older. * Foundation is thin, has a weird finish, and shows off anytjing you dknt want shown off like little mustache, acne, or tour pores. It also creases under eyes, smile lines, or eyebrow lines * Have been using this foundation for the past 2 weeks, has a medium to full coverage depending on how you build it up.
I do recommend you moisturize and prep skin before, without prep can cake around nose and under eye. * I saw some girl recommended this product and I had to try it. Trust me it is even better than I thought. It blends so nice and I get compliments on how good my makeup looks. * I purchased a neutral medium shade but it is so pink I can't use it. The shades are not described in my opinion. 

The formula is nice but nothing amazing. * so good i finally found a foundation that looks amazing and blends so good and color match is amazing would definitely recommend!"
97,estÃ©e lauder,double wear stay in place matte powder foundation refill,pimprod2031253,2593713," * I love this foundation. I first tried the stay wear liquid but I found that I like the stay wear powder foundation better. I have combination skin with hormonal acne and it doesn't aggravate my acne at all. I usually just get a under the skin bump or two on my chin a week before my cycle and this foundation doesn't make it worse or aggravate it in any way. I don't have any injections or fillers and I have some fine lines and it doesn't sit in those lines making me look older so I definitely like that. I take good care of my skin and  believe in aging gracefully. I know I am getting older and the wrinkles are coming but thats okay with me. My smile lines are from the wonderful smiles and laughs I've had and I wear them proudly. I eat a healthy diet, workout every morning and I only drink water and my skin reflects that and looks healthy. Just because we age doesn't mean we won't look good anymore. Healthy, glowing skin is beautiful at any age in my opinion. So, I use this powder foundation all year round and I definitely recommend using a good primer for your skin type before applying this foundation. It definitely keeps it looks good thru your work day. I use to solely use Clinique and I still use their eye shadow, mascara, blush and skincare but I had a good friend introduce me to this foundation and I literally ran out to get it lol. Just remember every day you wake up is a gift and a chance to shine :) * Once I apply Esstee's  Double wear foundation I use her compact powder to set the foundation.  It is a perfect complement to the foundation. * Love products * I wear 1c1 in winter but 2c1 in summer,I love how easy it is to change out shades with these refills. It's a wonderful, flexible formula that's never cakey. * I buy ivorynude (one if the lightest shades).The color mathecs perfects, at first. However, with a couple hours, my makeup looks a couple shades darker. I have worn this on my tropical vacations and it holds against water, still looking perfect. If you buy a couple shades lighter, it may work for you. * Love the smooth look 👌 * I am 47 with normal to dry skin. Full coverage long lasting!"
98,dior,forever natural nude foundation,pimprod2036826,2604394," * This foundation is amazing..it's as if the Forever Matte and Glow had a baby.  It gives such a beautiful satin finish that is not too matte and not too glowy just perfect. I will definitely buy this again and I've recommended it to quite a few of my friends and they love it as well! * I have been trying to decide why I am not reaching for this foundation and I have come to the conclusion I may have gotten an old bottle. The texture is thick and gel like; not what I would expect from a ""nude natural"" foundation. Looks cakey. and when I shake it I don't hear or feel any movement in the bottle. It doesn't really smell spoiled although it does have a fragrance as Dior does. I have tried thinning it out with oil or moisturizer but then it doesn't dry down as it should. I am disappointed but don't know if it's actually the product or that I received  an old bottle. Unfortunately I tossed the box. It's not impossible as I have received  expired products from the warehouse on a couple of other occasions. But I have definitely had better foundations that cost less. * I was not wowed by this foundation. maybe my color match wasn't the best. I am fair to light with a neutral leaning slightly warm complexion and I don't think there is a great match for me in this product. I did not find this product to look very natural or give me any sort of radiance. I felt it looked semi matte rather than a natural finish. Coverage was fine-light to medium as expected. I much prefer Chanel's Healthy Glow foundation. I have mature skin and think perhaps this foundation is better suited to a younger customer. I didn't dislike it but I would not repurchase it. For me it looked rather flat no matter how I prepped my skin. * This is a fantastic foundation! It's lightweight and  leaves me looking naturally flawless. I will say it doesn't completely cover dark spots/acne but I am personally fine with that- nothing a little concealer can't help with. I will definitely be repurchasing. * Wonderful product! * This is the best foundation that I have tried in at least the last 5 years of searching for ""the one"".  Not too heavy or too light. Not cakey and does not settle into my fine lines. This foundation lasts throughout the workday and well into the evening. Definitely worth the price. Finally!  I've found the one!! * Here's a quick review you can use for Dior foundation at Ulta:

""I absolutely love how smooth the Dior foundation applies to my skin! It blends effortlessly, giving me a flawless finish that feels lightweight yet provides great coverage. The formula feels luxurious, and it lasts all day without creasing or feeling heavy. Whether you're going for a natural look or building it up for full glam, this foundation is a game-changer. Highly recommend trying it out—you won't be disappointed!"""
99,mac,studio radiance serum powered foundation,pimprod2040797,2613967," * It matches perfectly. Hope there is a waterproof form. Going on a cruise and I need waterproof everything we need to make sure.lol * Have always used Mac, this was so light on the face, yet gave good coverage.  Did not feel like it was cakey. * My absolute favorite foundation mext to haus labs. This is so blurring on my skin, I recommend  using a gripping primer with this and i do wish that they had lighter shades. but seriously i would 100% recommend * Love this foundation - it's my only one! * This is my all time favorite foundation. You can use a light hand with a sponge for a skin like look like i do, or you can build it up with a brush/more product. Either way it looks so nice snd glowy but not shiny. It lasts on my dry combo skin all day when i set with a tiny bit of powder and setting spray. I try so many different foundations and i keep coming back to this one. * The serum foundation is a solid option for someone looking for coverage but not cakey coverage, which I've found with many of the other full-coverage foundations I've tried. It also feels nice on the skin, which makes sense with the serum component of the foundation. It is easy to apply with a damp sponge and lasts all day. * No foundation has ever worked well on my skin thats kinda oily but usually pretty dry. i prep my skin as always which is just with a light hydrating toner and use the elf hydra grip primer and it works so so good it lasts so long and looks so flawless, i live in a hot and humid area and it lasts so very good. never had a foundation like this. and the color match is perfect (i use NC11.5)"
100,maybelline,super stay up to 24hr hybrid powder-foundation,pimprod2036593,2603936," * I was looking for something to replace my beloved elf camo powder foundation after they discontinued it but this one is not it. The coverage is nonexistent, and texture is just chalky. Wish i could return but sadly tried too long to make it work and missed the return window. * not a good product for those with large pores or any texture. also wears off so quick * Like the name implies, this is definitely more than just a powder. I can wear it over a good primer instead of foundation and setting powder on some days. The finish is amazing!  The color selection is very good and this is great for touch ups at work or out and about. I keep one in my desk at work as well as my purse, love it!!!! * I have used this on and off and find it is a good reliable powder that always has a smooth and matte finish and wears well. I find the formula very matte, so it can be dry. Affordable and accessible. I would recommend to those with normal to oily skin. * Gets the job done in summer when it's hotter and more humid. Applies easily with a foundation brush, doesn't get cakey or dry. No need to blend since it's a powder. Powder blush goes over it and blends easily. I also like how quickly and cleanly this applies, vs. liquid products. * This product contains silica which can damage DNA and the nano particles can help your skin asorb the harmful ingredients of the other trash makeup you're buying! * The best powder foundation ive found and ive tried many. Here's a list of ones ive tried and i still like this better than: Make Up For Ever blurring powder foundation, Bareminerals original loose powder mineral foundation, Jane Iredale loose powder foundation, Jane Iredale pressed powder foundation, Tarte Amazonian Clay loose powder foundation. So yeah — ive tried A LOT. Everytime i come back to this one, i question why i keep trying to find something better. Make sure to first prep your skin with a good moisturizer and primer before applying. Let both fully absorb and dry before applying a powder foundation. This is simply the best ive found and each time i wear it, i get told how good my skin looks and even most recently, how i look like im still in my 20s lol. Im way past 20s."

102,tarte,amazonian clay blurring powder foundation,pimprod2036934,2604704," * Love Tarte products * Only powder I will ever use! Has a great matt finish and covers so well! * Creamy, yet light. Feels good on the skin. * I usually use the shape tape pressed powder foundation, but i wanted to give this a try. Definitely going back to the shape tape because this makes my skin feel like clay by the end of the day. The shape tape foundation usually doesnt lift on my jose after wearing my sunglasses, but this powder comes right off and theres no blending it back to look normal. I also feel like i have to wash my face sooner bevause it feels so tight and uncomfortable after 6-7 hours of wear. I felt like i looked cake-y right after application too, and thats not a normal thing for me. Im going to finish the powder, but I won't be purchasing this pressed foundation again. * I have tarte's Amazonian clay liquid in my rotation of foundations, and loved the coverage. I wanted something to cover my shiny nose mid-day, gave this a try. 

This is just awful. Streaky somehow even when applied with a brush. I'd say it sits on top of the skin awkwardly, but I think it actually breaks the laws of physics and hovers several mm above the skin out in space, yet still streaky. If i use enough to combat the oily nose sheen, then it looks like pancake makeup. Using setting spray is not useful, because that causes it to settle into every texture on my face. I end up needing to constantly mess with this to get it to look good, exactly what i was trying to avoid by using this powder. 

I've tried everything. * There are very few options for powder for the minimal make up gen xer that I am. Sometimes I just want to cover some of the shine, so hopelessly out of fashion of me I know but real life skin has things that I want to cover and foundation powder had been my friend for many years. Out of the slim pickings this was my choice. Immediate negative was that the pan was loose from the compact and I had to find my glue dots to fix. The coverage is fine and I like the more minimal compact but I don't think it would survive in a purse. Which is the clutch point as to why i love powder compacts, you can put them in your bag and they survive. Absolutely loved playing with my grandma's compact and wish that beautiful compacts would come back because we need something easy and elegant in this world. * The pressed powder is very fine and delicate, creating a natural makeup finish that looks like naturally flawless skin. It doesn't control oil or provide coverage, but I don't think that's a big issue because it's already incredibly convenient."
103,pat mcgrath labs,skin fetish: sublime perfection foundation,pimprod2040434,2613894," * This foundation is very ""watery"" which I was warned of but it doesn't bother me and it goes on nicely. The coverage is light but buildable. My skin is prone to oxidizing foundations terribly and this is the best foundation I have found that doesn't oxidize as bad as others on my skin. * this is an amazing foundation. the only con is the bottle. it WILL squirt all over you if you are running low so DO NOT apply in your going out outfit. it stains your clothes * This product has such a light consistency, ince it dries down its like wearing nothing. Lovely medium coverage that can be built upon. Makes skin look perfected and lasts all day * This is such a beautiful foundation. It give enough to cover redness and uneven tones but still looks natural and not heavy. You dont even know you have anything on. Beautiful for mature skin. * Since my diet is vegan it is important to know that my favorite foundation is vegan as well. I get THE MOST compliments on my skin when im wearing this foundation. It is extremely lightweight and goes on like a dream. Perfect amount of coverage and never streaks or cracks. Amazing quality worth the investment. Nothing else beats this! * I was not sure about this after seeing complaints about stinging, tightness, and so on. I use a high strength retinol in the winter so skin tends to be sensitive and dry now (Jan.) I was pleasantly surprised that this serum felt great for me. Obviously, lots of people are sensitive to this, but I was lucky. It actually feels hydrating.

It is easy to blend but the ""runny"" reviews are 100% correct. I build in a number of passes or just use a good concealer + a couple of pumps.

Now, the color choices. Even for a lighter coverage foundation, Ulta's availability of shades was inadequate. I got a ""yellow neutral"" shade because there were no pink or just neutrals in my depth in stock. It works ok since I usually do not build coverage, but I don't understand why they added neutral to descriptions. It is a straight-up warm foundation, although it is not as intensely yellow as some other brands. 

I am not sorry I purchased and wear this every day. Not sure I would recommend at this price point for most people for the trickiness of application, difficulty matching, and risk of sensitivity. I would probably repurchase but only with full shade range like other brands with 40+ (not sure if we can name?) * if I could marry a makeup product I would marry this one. I hate the feeling of foundation on my face and this one looks like skin and feels like skincare. I have put my sisters, my mother, my friends all on this product and everyone is amazed."

She broke apart, leaving a weird finish on skin. It still looked ok from afar but the moment you got close it was a disaster. I tried and tried again. I thought maybe it's my sunscreen, my serum, my moisturizer. But no matter what I switched out, the same thing happened - goes on great and breaks apart in an hour or two. I returned her :( * I have oily/combo acne prone skin. This product is great on my oily sections and provides a full coverage. It has an insane amount of product, I have used a lot of it and ive had it for over a year yet still have half. It can cling to my pimples a little bit but as i wear it through the day it blends into it. * I have used Hourglass (which I prefer) as well as IT Cosmetics and both have changed the description for their products (from a name to a number and vice versa). I have a number on my Hourglass stick and unfortunately can't reorder online. So frustrating!
IT doesn't even have the description on the product so that sealed the deal for them. Makes no sense why they make it so hard for the consumer. * Good color match and formula. Problem packaging, amount of product, and price. The product was stuck to the cap. I was able to get the product out and place it in a tiny jar. Packaging needs redesign for the price. Can't recommend for this reason. * No matter which technique I try, the outcome is always the same: it cracks, transfers, and looks terrible after just half an hour. It exacerbates my acne, making me feel like I've wasted my money 😞 * I was really excited to try this foundation as I have heard a makeup artist I watch on youtube obsess over it for years. I tried this foundation two times and returned it after the second try. Both times I wore it, it gave the same poor results. This foundation does provide full coverage which was exciting to me, but the longer I wore it, the worst it looked. I could almost tell after a few minutes of having it on, it was alresdy breaking down on my skin. Very disappointed. I wish it would have worked. * I was really excited to try this foundation as I have heard a makeup artist I watch on youtube obsess over it for years.

105,wyn beauty,featuring you hydrating skin enhancing tint spf 30,pimprod2044322,2622290," * This is my favorite skin tent that gives full coverage foundation, but so lightweight you don't even feel it on your face. It matches very well. I have three different shades one that matches my skin tone on my body when that matches my face and one that's my summer shade that it's a little darker and I've never failed. I just got back from a wedding in Mexico. The humidity did leave me a little sweaty, but the make up still stayed intact * After giving this product a few tries, I can say it is patchy. 
I tried moisturizing my face to see how it works but I ended up patchy. 
Without moisturizer it is hard to blend and not use a lot of it. 
I will keep it because I like to wear tint and spf every day, living in Florida. Plus the price was right during a sale. * I really wanted to like this, I really did. I tried with my hydrogrip primer, my elf poreless putty primer, bith primers together, a smashbox blur primer, no primer with just my cerave moisturizer, no primer with just hydration serum, and finally just nothing. I wasn't looking for anything in particular with this skin tint, but holy moly, this does not work in any sort of way. It highlights all the hairs on my face and separates from the skin, leaving that blotchy cakey look. I really am happy this works for some people but maybe its my skin type, it just does not work for me. It gives my skin a textured finish due to it highlighting all the hairs, looks like I haven't blended my powder in when I'm not even wearing powder. * I was really excited about this because the shades are really inpressive however i got the order and it just fell short. It doesnt blend nicely in to the skin. It just kind of sits on top and if you rub it in too much it just iind of breaks up and yiure left with patches that dont get covered. Its almost like the pigment seperates fron the base. Its very strabge. This is day 3 of havibg the product and tryibg different applicatiob methods and still no success. Im gonna keeo trying a fee more days since i already have it. If i cant get it to work, ill be returning it. Even if i do get it to work, i still cant recommend bc there are so many lower cost skin tints that arent bearly as finicky. Defibutely save your money. Go to the drug store and if you dont nind soending a frw dollars get the Live Tinted tinted SPF or the Colorscience, or the Elta MD, or Beauty of Joseon. Honestly so many other,
 better options. * I love this product so much.  My skin is glowing.  I have gotten nothing but compliments on how radiant my skin is.  Love, love, love this product!! * Overall, it's okay. The color match was a little off but I made it work. I bought it because it has SPF in it, and I found it works best to blend/rub it in like sunscreen. If you set it with a powder it's great and lasts pretty much all day. * I absolutely love this product. It's now the only sunscreen I use. I live in Florida, where sunscreen is a must; but finding a product that works and does not cause breakouts on my extremely sensitive skin is challenging. Fortunately, Wyn's tinted sunscreen works wonderfully. I wear it daily, and it matches my skin tone perfectly. People assume I am not wearing any product whatsoever. Hint, allow it to sit on your face for 5 minutes before judging it. You won't be disappointed."

I have mature skin and have lots of spots covers great with little color correction. Little expensive but a little goes a long way. Definitely worth a try * It clung to every dry patch no matter how much I prepped and it separated. * I don't usually write reviews, but I felt like I had to this time—just to give some insight before you spend your money on this foundation.

First off, I LOVE Hourglass. I've been obsessed with their concealers—they've been my go-to for so long—so I really thought I'd love their foundation too… but sadly, I was super disappointed. This foundation is not it.

For reference, I've used Estée Lauder and thought it was decent, but I was still curious to try this one. I always prep my skin well, but even with that, this foundation went on patchy and came off so easily. Ijust didn't sit right. I've never had this issue with my past foundations. Like… what?? 😩

Just wanted to share my experience in case it helps any of you. If you're looking for a reliable, everyday foundation, I honestly don't think this one is worth the price. :( * For context, I have combo to oily skin. I tried this foundation for two weeks. No matter what prep I did, no matter what I set it with, it highlighted every pore and line on my face. It looked cakey and greasy (I used less than 1 pump). It does provide good coverage, and it doesn't feel heavy on the skin. Just didn't work for me. * I had an appointment in the salon for formal makeup for a masquerade ball, and the artist doing my makeup pulled out this brand to use and it was the most perfect shade match Ive ever seen for my skin, I went and bought it immediately * I tried my best to love this foundation but I have oily skin and after an hour this foundation transfered to snuthing I touched. Did not stay sll day. I tried preping my skin, primer, setting it smd bsking it nothing worked. If I touched my face bevause if whatever readon the foundation would come off!!! Very disappointing becsuse i love how light weight it is. Definetly not worth the money. Might go back to estee lauder * I love that this foundation does NOT oxidize on my skin! Feels super lightweight and doesn't even look like I have a full face of foundation when I wear it. Will definitely be getting again once I run out!"

My daughter found this for me and so far i absolutely love it. The color match is perfect.  It goes on so soft and smooth and there is not a weird or strong smell. * Good coverage. * The first time gave me a rash so I waited a couple of months to make sure it was this and I tried it again and gave a red bumps all over my face. I'm not the only one. There's a lot of bad reviews w the same effect. * Excellent powder foundation for older women.  I don't know why my color doesn't seem to be available anymore though.  What's going on with the limited shade offerings?  Fenty still has all 50 shades on their website! * Ive been using this powder in shade 150 since it came out. All of a sudden theres no lighter shades? Not even one around the color ive been using. I've probably went through 10 of these compacts, and am beyond disappointed. Def gives me the ick for the brand!! * Perfect match for my skin tone. * I did the color match online and they matched me with a Shane that is not even available anymore. At the store I matched with 210 and the consultant said they are not going to carry that shade anymore. why would this supposedly inclusive brand cut all these different shades from their lineup? Now I guess I have to find another brand to buy powder from."
109,covergirl,simply ageless skin perfector essence foundation,pimprod2042952,2618803," * I would have given this a higher rating, but this foundation irritated my skin. It made it dry, and small bumps started to appear, as well as making my pores appear larger.  Which is too bad; I would have liked this otherwise.  The first time I applied it, it evened out my blotchiness without having a thick layer of makeup on my skin, but my skin texture got progressively worse every day I wore this makeup.  So, it's not for me. * I love this stuff! Helps even out my skin tone, and for acne I spot conceal. Lasts all day for me (with setting powder and spray) and it feels so lightweight. I like this better then any high end product. * nothing ive used gives the same best-skin finish without looking like im wearing makeup. It also pairs well with all types of concealers, cheek and powder products. 

I know it's a bit expensive for cover girl but this formula is really excellent, and I like it better than what its duping bc it has zero scent. Also a bottle last 8-10months if used everyday. Just need small little dots for a naturally perfect skin look.

Keep this one around Cover Girl! * I absolutely love this product!! I was going to buy it myself, but im so thankful it got sent to me!! I love that the beads come together to create a nice lightweight coverage. The packaging is super cool too!! * Absolutely in love with this from the moment I tried it. It was gifted to me and exceeded my expectations! Coverage is great without weighing on my face, and looks so good on my skin!🩷 * This was beyond amazing! The coverage is great without feeling heavy on my face, and lasts so long! Literally my favorite foundation now🩷 * I was gifted the Covergirl Simply Ageless Skin Perfector Essence in shade 40 medium , and I love it! It feels light on my skin, blends easily, and gives a smooth, natural look. My skin looks more even and feels super soft. Great shade match too!

110,colourpop,pretty fresh hyaluronic hydrating foundation,pimprod2016944,2566879," * Im very pale and this is one of a few foundations that worked for me that didnt break the bank, but it was a little thick and transferred * This foundation seemed to be pretty nice at first, it looked like my exact shade (I got shade matched), but no…. Hours later I looked at myself and saw that I resembled an Oompa Loompa more than I'd like to admit. Not judging if you're going for that look, it's just not for me. I didn't want to show my face but look at the color of my neck vs my cheek. It was originally the shade of my neck but it turned orange. * I tried this ColourPop foundation and I just love it. The moisture it provides gives your look a facial glow and a wonderful fresh feel. I will definitely purchase this product again! * This foundation is amazing!! It has a beautiful finish on my skin. It pairs well with my primer and moisturizer, which is a plus. I wish it came in a bigger bottle, but the quality of the product makes up for it. * This foundation is amazing!! It has a beautiful finish on my skin. It pairs well with my primer and moisturizer, which is a plus. I wish it came in a bigger bottle, but the quality of the product makes up for it. * I have combo skin; my T-zone is an oil slick, there are random patches of extremely dry skin, and the rest is normal.

T-zone: foundation separates and looks really bad. No powder or application technique can fix it.

Random dry patches: foundation cakes up, but not terribly. It would be passable by the ""3 feet"" rule.

Normal skin: foundation is BEAUTIFUL, which sucks, because how many people actually have completely normal skin? The negative reviews are so hot + cold because this foundation wasn't formulated for a specific skin type outside of ""normal"".

The overall pros: foundation blends seamlessly and the shade match is excellent. It has a beatiful, dewy-satin finish, and cream products lay really nicely on top of it. I rebought this three times because the majory of my skin was ""normal"" and it looked so nice, I could pretend my T-zone wasnt a disaster lol. It also wore well in the sun and hot environments for a few hours, and never oxidized on me.

The cons: aside from the dry/oily problems, there is something in this foundation that made my face itch like CRAZY. It wasnt until I ran out and bought a drugstore brand on the fly, that I realized it was this foundation. After about 4-6 hours on my face, it would itch unbearably. Additionally, there is no setting powder or technique that could keep this foundation from transferring. If you rub your face at all, sweat, or get liquid on it while wearing it, you're cooked.

This was a book but I hope it was thorough enough to help someone who might be deciding if this foundation would be right for them! * Doesn't look cakey on the skin, goes on really nicely, if you're on the fence about buying it. Buy it you won't regret it"
111,l'orÃ©al,age perfect radiant serum foundation,pimprod2017262,2569315," * This product goes on smoothly with a damp sponge. It has medium coverage and can be built up a bit. It lasts a good, long time too. I only gave it four stars because I can't find a shade that works perfectly. They're all a little too orange. * I will definitely buy it again. * Smooth and even application, blends nicely * I tried four shades in this product and none worked.  I used Ulta's shade match tool with no success. * I have used many many foundations over the years. Some I've liked, others not. This is my favorite. I have a combo/dry skin with a few fine lines and this looks lovely on the skin. Nice coverage, minimizes pores, non drying. You need to prep your skin before applying any foundation. I wear the lightest shade ivory, it doesn't oxidize or turn orange. Great foundation. * The coverage is okay but there is no moisturizer or radiance. It makes my skin very dry and cakey. * This product has nice light coverage.  I mix 2 colors to achieve my perfect match, and I apply with a brush in a circular fashion. I do not have the problem of it settling into lines.  It is the absolute best for sun protection!  I might cry if it were discontinued."

Only reason I don't give it five stars is because I have insurmountable standards, but it's pretty good * honestly. i love this foundation. i found my perfect shade match. my only issue is that it doesn't really last on my nose and my chin. those are the spots on my face that have the most oil. i dont know if that's something i can fix myself or not but overall i love this foundation. its also super lightweight * Wow!! I have tried so many foundations high-end and affordable. This foundation has taken 1st place🥇
Just for reference I'm combination skin. 
And this foundation just gets better with wear. * I really wanted to love this foundation as I love rem beauty.. so glad I got to test before buying. It most likely was an ingredient that didnt agree with my skin. I'm not giving one star because i know people that love this but I have dry skin with rosacea.. not the most sensitive skin but more sensitive than average. Even with prep of many products with foundation was DRY on me. Stuck to dry patches.. didnt blend well at all. I'm also super pale and I feel like I was inbetween shades as one was either super pale or too dark. Waiting for Ari to maybe release a skin tint for this reason. 🫶🏻 * A little goes a long way. Great buildable coverage. Affordable and looks good."
114,chanel,les beiges water-fresh complexion touch,pimprod2037597,2595874," * The best foundation i have ever tried for my 40 year old skin! This smooths over absolutoly everything from acne scars to fine lines to big pores, and it is seemless and understandable on the skin. It doesnt sit on top of skin or add any texture. I hope Chanel keeps this forever!! 

I tried water tint and it's fine. I feel like it performs like many other tints and makes me look greasy. This newer touch one leaves me flawless! I've gone theough hundreds of foundations looking for this effect. I love this so much. I get compliments everytime I wear it. Never discontinue! * Finding a water based foundation is difficult. I stumbled across this foundation about a year ago and have used it ever since. In the beginning I had some trouble getting it to look good on my skin. I realized I had to MIX till it was uniform and then put it on. With a powder on top it looks decent, it's thin and non blurring so my texture shows just a little bit. It's been workable, it doesn't break me out and it being water based helps keep my grease prone skin in check.  I am falling out of love with it recently. The most recent bottle feels different in some way. It feels greasier. I look pasty and it gives me uncanny valley vibes. I am pretty pale, but not sickly looking like this foundation shows me to be. At the price tag, I don't care to go and buy another shade. It has been my go to for so long but I am ready to branch out to other water based skin tints. I'm sure this works for people so I'm not going to say I don't recommend it, I am not offended that after a year it stopped working for me. It's thin, but will quickly build and be cakey if you put too much on. It's not something I could ever put on my skin without powder to set it. * I have tried many foundation formulations and this is hands down the best for radiant flawless skin. My skin is on the dry side and no matter what foundations I use they sit on my skin and show flaws. This foundation is very light, but covers beautifully and helps balance skin tone. A little goes a long way so the less you use the better and best applied with a foundation sponge. My daughter also purchased this foundation and her skin is radiant. A must have worth the money. * This is an odd product. Luckily the Ulta associate provided me with a sample so I was able to return the unused product. The beads are odd and the coverage is uneven. * So soft on my skin I love this for the days I don't wear makeup! * Do not make a shade light enough for my fair complexion nor do they make a shade light enough for my friends * I have been on a hunt to find the perfect no makeup makeup look with the least number of products. I have fairly good skin with some hyperpigmentation which is my only concern. This product gives a satin finish that smooths out your skin and somehow still manages to keep your skin looking like skin. I wish there were more shades for olive undertones but overall the product works on different tones because of the type of coverage it offers. love it"
115,juvia's place,i am magic velvety matte foundation,pimprod2006831,2550494," * The full coverage is amazing. * This is the best foundation I have used. It goes on smoothly and has full coverage. It covers the imperfections I have. * I wish I could leave a before and after picture.  I can not use any other foundation that gives me the coverage I need for my pigmented skin.  I use four different tubes to highlight blend and I BEAT that face you hear me.
Eyeshadow is amazing as well. * The product is good, but it does separate. At first, I thought it was just my primer, but over time, it separated. But I do have to say a little goes a long way when applying it. * This is my first time trying a product from Juvia's Place and I am in love!! I was drawn to this foundation because of the inclusion of all the shades. I took a guess and bought online and found my exact shade! It's so smooth and build able, I absolutely love it. My go to foundation from now on! * Definitely worth the buy my only con so far is that comes off a little too easy with regular mundane task like a little runny or water from eyes or too long of contact with anything may cause it to come off some but then again I might need better setting soap that's why i gave it a 4 star * i really really love this foundation i just wish it came in a bigger bottle! this little thing wont lash me very long, but very good foundation!!"

I like a multi-tasking products. * I LOVE this foundation. Perfect Match. I heard it was discontinued and was so bummed. But it isn't!!! Thank goodness!! Here it is. I have an extremely hard time finding a match for my pale skin. Thank you soooo much! Buyer for life.. * Great makeup either an older people like me and they're 60s covers blemishes and age spots pretty well * Honestly it's pretty great! Color matched perfect and the application feels more like foundation w/ light coverage. I apply it with a beauty blender, finish with Elf hi-Def setting powder and I'm out the door! Try it for yourself :) * For a long time, instead of using foundation I used either Shape Tape or Born This Way where I need it most and would just blend it out onto my moisturizer.  This summer I developed some really bad sunspots and no matter how much corrector/concealer I'd use, my skin would look grey where the sun spots were.  One day, I tried this because I had gotten a sample and omg it has saved me!  I finally felt comfortable going out again without thinking everyone was staring at me.  The weird part was, it wasn't as heavy or full coverage as my concealer but worked 100x better.  Well, I'm finally at the end of that little tube and also, I now need a lighter color, so here I am.  

This CC cream is better than any other I've tried, it somehow has great coverage but looks incredibly soft and natural.  I'm also able to use it where I need it without seeing lines of demarcation.  This is most definitely an unsung hero and I'm baffled as to how it doesn't have a better rating. * I came in today looking for the tarte BB cream, but saw the cloud CC cream and went with it instead.  It matched well, covered great & has a light feel.  However, I got home and went on the tarte website only to discover it's already been discontinued.  😩 WHY?!? * I love Tarte. Not my favorite foundation, but its great for every day or summertime."
118,exa,high fidelity foundation,pimprod2019009,2573283," * ECSTATIC IN AN UNDERSTATMENT!!! I have been searching for a foundation like this for YEARSSS. (I have super sensitive combo skin leaning dry. Liquid foundations always look terrible on me after 1 hour. I do great skin prep too!) Lightweight, breathable foundation, quality ingredients, minimal ingredients, fragrance free, light to medium coverage, skin like finish, 6 to 8 hour wear still looking flawless, doesnt dry my skin out, doesnt irritate my skin, doesnt cling to dry patches, COLOR MATCH ON POINT, skincare ingredients, AFFORADABLE, anti-pollution (I live in SLC, worst air quality/pollution here) I  literally cried when i first put this foundation on i was so blown away at how perfect it was. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NEVER EVER discontinue or reformulate. I am a customer for life and this foundation has changed my life. * very skin like finish! no fuss foundation. * This is an undetectable foundation on my mature, dry skin, though it can build easily for extra coverage. I will just add additional drops on those darker spots, which still peek through but look more homogenous. But coverage is not my main concern, so this winner maintains the slightly dewy glow over a well -prepped skin base, still looking un made-up by the end of the day. Also, goes over mineral sunscreen flawlessly. IMO it is on par with Haus Labs, Nars Radiant LIght, MUF reboot; my other favs. I am trying another shade, though am happy with Katey, the match I found via the skin models- so that's my recommendation for finding your shade, rather than the description. It is on sale, so... TRY IT! * I'm assuming this foundation is on clearance because of quality issues… I received my order and the formula is completely separated and cannot be mixed back together to a good consistency. * I was so surprised when i first used it, my skin looked like skin. I like a lightweight natiral finish and this gives me exactly that! It also stays on all day/night, only thing is that it oxidizes a little bit but not wnything drastic. Has been my go-to foundation for over a year already! * good match for hard shade (fair/light olive) and good for sensitive/acne prone/scar/texture skin. decent coverage but feels light and natural. but doesnt really set (makeup smudges on my cat) & taking the top off pulls the entire pump out sometimes * I have used this foundation for a few years and it's never let me down. I fluctuate between a range of their lighter, cool toned shades depending on the time of year. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. A few things I've learned along the way: 

*A thin base layer will cover most spots and uneven tones. If you need more coverage, then spot treat with a little more foundation.
*It pairs beautifully on top of Nudestix tinted sunscreen.
*Applies well with brushes or sponges, but better with your fingers.
*A stippling, dabbing motion is the best method to apply the thin layers.

I'm 41, and I receive many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation, and I feel like I look more youthful with this on. I will definitely continue to repurchase!"
119,bareminerals,original pure serum radiant natural liquid foundation mineral spf 20,pimprod2040524,2611614," * I recently had an associate at Ulta help me select a new foundation. I told her I had mature oily skin and I wanted a lightweight foundation with sunscreen. She picked this Bare Minerals serum foundation and put a small sample on my face. Honestly, it looked pretty nice in the store but by the time I got home the product had settled into every fine line, wrinkle, and pore. I thought it was just because I hadn't put a primer on and decided to keep trying at home. NOPE -- still horrible in every way possible. To make it worse, the cap doesn't come off easily, and in my efforts to twist and turn it off, I accidentally loosened the lid and foundation went flying EVERYWHERE. Took forever to clean it off counters and mirrors because it just smeared. Horrible product and packaging. I don't know how anyone can successfully wear or even use this product. * I love bare minerals and have used the original loose powder foundation but it wasn't sitting right on minute skin anymore so thoigh I would try the serum foundation.  Still did not work well with my dry skin. I will be returning * I bought this last year and have used it a handful of times. It is the only makeup I've ever bought that I can wear for long periods of time and not have zits/acne forming under the surface. But while it looks great when applied, after a couple hours it separates and settles into all my pores and its not a good look. On the hunt for a similar product line that doesn't have this issue. * This used to be my go to foundation for years I dont lnow when they changed the formula and shades. I went online and used a color match that said my original Aspen 04 is now fair nuetral 15. It was wrong the color is totally different and had a orange undertone. I havnt been able to find the righg shade with these new colors so disappointed. * I'm a bareminerals girl but this is the worst foundation ever made. Its greasy, doesn't dry, doesn't blend, looks terrible no matter what you do to try to make it look okay. They need to redo this. I can't believe they ever allowed this terrible foundation on the market. * If your skin is well prepped, well exfoliated, and well moisturized, this foundation is awesome. If you're more like me, though, and you're someone who doesn't have time to do a full prep every morning, you might want to avoid this one for daily use. The foundation likes to settle into any dry spots and can accumulate in creases. Application of this foundation is a bit more technique sensitive compared to other foundations. For special occasions where I have the time to do a full skin prep and very carefully apply this (the consistency is very watery and almost a little grainy?), I really like this foundation, but for daily use (aka I have ten minutes before work to put on makeup) I'm not a fan.

I will probably buy this again, because it does have a beautiful finish and it is one of the few foundations that actually matches my skin tone, but this is not my go-to daily foundation. * Love it so far!"

Horrible shade range, greasy, and not something I would buy again. * Starting with the positives, the formula of this product is very gentle and skin-friendly. I have extremely sensitive skin that's also acne-prone and this didn't irritate my skin or break me out. The color-matching is also great, it matches my skin perfectly. However, the coverage of this product is so light I barely tell the difference between wearing this and rocking my bare face. It doesn't cover up my acne or acne scars at all. It also creases very easily. For such an expensive product, I thought this would fix all of my skincare woes, but alas. It did nothing. Save your money! * Terrible! Made my face extremely oily! And my color match is darker than my actual skin tone. This is hoing straight to the trash! * My skin loves this foundation and shade 110 is the most perfect shade match I've ever found (and I've tried many foundations). 

Unfortunately it does transfer easily even with setting sprays. Not good for work if you wear a mask (like healthcare). * Honestly a waste of money, * nonono * My skin liked this foundation I usually rotate to a different foundation during the summer and this one lasts me all day, feels like light, dewy and has good medium coverage considering it's a skin tint.

Unless someone is looking for it they wont notice. * this foundation is so good idk why the reviews are making it sound so mid. i use a lot of glowy products underneath it and it's kind of matte/""satin"" at first but then wears so beautifully throuhout the day without looking too dewy like with some od my other foundations. i recommend trying it with something like the CT glow stick or juvias place glow booster! * I wanted to love this product, its very hydrating but a little too oily for my skin to where it broke me out a bit in areas I don't typically breakout.. for reference I have normal to dry/hormonal acne prone skin. * I have combo skin and wanted to

Its got amazing coverage, and when i had acne it didn't accentuate it one bit. Now that Im in my mid 20s i still reach for it, it doesnt feel heavy and it lasts me all day. It has to do with technique too, on any foundation tbh, I prefer to build and blend until I get it just right. I love the applicator too. * I started using this foundation in 2022 and havent used a different once since! With acne (cystic) it easily applies and as long as you dont touch your face too much it lasts for hours! This product seriously changed my life.

What a waste of money. * Love this moisturizing skin tint.  And I love that its light as I'm not a foundation girl * Nice tint that provides godo coveragd. I use with a primer. * Love the product is usually hard to find a skin tent that is good for my complexion would definitely recommend a brown skin girls and who doesn't love a skin tint with SPF in it * 3/5, I don't know how I feel about this one. It does make you look dewy and glowy, but it does not stay put for so long. It is very oily. * This stuff is amazing! My skin glows!"

It's a gorgeous color that lasts all day without looking cakey or blotchy. * love  the natural look. I will buy again * I did not like this product and when I went to take it back because I had bought it over 60 days ago they would not give me a store credit.  You can obviously tell I had used it very little. 
I think this is a horrible policy that you don't stand behind your products longer than 60 days! * Im a huge fan of Juvia's products.  The formula is always spot on and I love how much coverage you get from the powder foundation. Ita light and feels great on my skin. * very pigmented and creamy powder formula, though not much product in each pan. hit pan in 3 uses, but I absolutely love the formula. * I really ended up liking this foundation. I feel like I have odd coloring and have a very hard time finding foundations that match but this has been great. It provides that ""clean girl"" look but can also go into a full beat. I think the advisement/examples for the colors are way off. If I hadn't been in store for my purchase my color match would have been wildly incorrect. And I'd use a brush for application and avoid the sponge provided. I honestly might go down a shade for the winter but this will be a great summer color! Would def buy again! * I had high hopes for this powder I use alot of Juvias stuff. I'm Native/Mexican and tan quickly in the summer so I was looking for summer shades as opposed to my winter shades but this stuff turned orange so fast on me it also felt like baby powder. I don't have flakey skin and this made me look like I had flakes. I will be returning it. I used a dense brush on bare dry skin maybe it would work another way but not like this on me."
131,blk/opl,true color skin perfecting stick foundation spf 15,pimprod2022198,2579236," * This makeup is great! It applies easy and covers well while giving you the look of no makeup on. One of my new favorites! I am pretty fair skin and was nervous about the color but it looks great! * I am beyond impressed with the BLK Opal Stick Foundation! As someone who swears by the Lancôme stick foundation, I wasn't expecting this to compare—but wow, it's THEE dupe! The coverage is flawless and full, yet somehow still feels lightweight and breathable on the skin. It glides on like butter and blends effortlessly, whether I'm using a brush, sponge, or even my fingers on the go.

This stick has officially earned a permanent spot in my beauty bag. It's perfect for everyday wear or a full glam look, and I love how buildable it is without ever getting cakey. The finish? Smooth, radiant, and skin-like. I'm so glad I gave this a try—it's proof that affordable doesn't mean sacrificing quality.

BLK Opal, you've got a fan for life! * I have discloid  LUPUS  and this BLack Opal CAROB Conceals my discoloration  perfectly.  I am very  Sasitfied. * As someone who deals with hormonal acne and hyperpigmentation, the Black Opal Beauty 
True Color Foundation in Warm Almond has been a game-changer in my routine. Its full-coverage, matte finish seamlessly blends into my skin, ensuring my dark spots and acne scars stay hidden all day.

What I love most is its versatility—whether I'm doing a full glam look or wearing it alone, it delivers flawless, lightweight coverage without feeling heavy. Black Opal continues to be a staple in my beauty routine, and this concealer is an absolute must-have! * This product provides great coverage,long wear,user friendly and there is a shade for all skin colors and types. Thank you Black Opal. * Product is so easy to blend out. Has so much pigment and is good for any skin tones. Definitely inclusive * Creamy and smooth it glides right on. Blends very well also very good pigment. My usual brand was out of my shade so I decided to try different brand and I'm not disappointed to say the least 😊"

I was looking for a dupe for the maybelline super stay active wear foundation and was recommended this one. When i tell you it felt like i was just lathering straight oil on my face i mean it, it look like i dunked my face in frying oil bro. Then i set it and no matter what it would transfer really bad also it totally sucked up my bronzer and blush which are also juvias place idk why tho ive never had that issue. Also i forgot to mention the smell…omg its like the strongest apple jolly rancher you could ever have but in the absolute worst way like so strong it gives you a headache. Anyways, ima be returning it cause im never gonna use it again🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ * covers nicely, didn't irritate my sensitive skin, and isn't super wet.  on the down side, my skin is very dry and the foundation really liked to crease and absorb in the dead skin flakes.  I recommend starting with a firm base.  (lotion, sunscreen, primer, etc.) * This product is flattering when placed on your face. Not too thick or chalky. * I wanted to love this foundation so much because JP is my favorite makeup brand so it kills me to give a less than satisfactory review. I'll start with the positives: stunning finish! I love how glowy and full coverage it is. Afterall, thats what JP is known for. However, it transfers so bad!! 😭 its to the point where I cant hug people before it gets on their clothes. I have tried setting it, gripping primers, using multiple setting sprays but frankly it just does not dry down. Its a shame because its a such a great foundation otherwise. * This foundation is my everyday for work its light enough that it feels like a skin tint on my skin, but is very full coverage. Definitely has a light floral scent for the sensitive skin people out there to keep in mind * This product doesn't take to much to give you a fresh glow. So grateful that I found this product by the assistant that helped me.  Plus it's reasonable in price"
133,essence,16h cover & last powder foundation,pimprod2033174,2597553," * I saw a couple of online reviews recommending this, but my expectations were low considering the price point. I was surprised by how smooth and flawless my skin looked! I'm definitely a skincare rule-follower, so my skin was well prepped by my normal routine (exfoliation, moisturizer, primer). I didn't test the 16 hour claims, but I can attest to 7 or 8 hours of flawless looking skin.  It does have a little bit of scent, but that seemed to fade pretty quickly. * Easy to apply, it gives you medium coverage that looks like your skin. It's matte and perfect fie combo skin. Everything sits beautifully on top of the foundation. Its a great product for the price. * I found this powder foundation online and wanted to give it a try. I used the color chart online and it said I needed the color Vanilla, but upon trying it, turned out to be VERY light and also not really a foundation. I exchanged the Vanilla color for 2 shades darker and it's much better now. I use this as a powder to very lightly cover my face at the end of my makeup application. Feels soft and stays put. Happy with my purchase and I expect this to last me a long long time. Thanks, Ulta!!! * I would buy Essence cover and last again. This project gives you full coverage and stays on all night. Love it! * Love this product. It goes on easily. It is lightweight, and it lasts for hours. * Its a no for me, too dry doesn't look and feel like foundation more like a powder. * Its a no for me, too dry doesn't look and feel like foundation more like a powder."

The cream to powder is perfect, its so lightweight and you can make the coverage as light or full as you want. It bkends like a dream and the color match was spot on. Would definitely recommend! * I absolutely love the cream to powder foundation. It provides full coverage but doesn't feel heavy on the skin. I would buy over and over again. * I have been wanting to try this foundation for a while,  as I love some of the other Milani products, but one of the drawbacks is it can only be purchased online. I finally ordered it and it's ok. I took a quiz to see which color I should order since I've never ordered it before. Again it's only available online, so I can't go test the shades in the store. I am usually an ivory shade in other brands so I got the 220 creamy natural. When it came in, my first reaction was ""oh no"" my fear of ordering the wrong shade came true as the foundation looked really dark and orange. Since I already had it, I decided to test it anyway knowing full well it would not match, but it sort of did end up matching. The dark orange color was just like a film and it was lighter underneath and it blends really well. It feels really lightweight and breathable. It almost feels like you aren't even wearing make up, which makes sense since I found it to be very light coverage. I was hoping for medium to full coverage, but it just evened my skin out like a BB cream would do. I would still recommend it for the price, but wouldn't compare it to the KVD as that's how it was promoted to me. * I took the shade match quiz, the shade was way too light and when applied looks cakey and clings to dry patches. * I got this foundation in the lightest shade and its still too dark and orange. It cakes extremely bad even with two lifht layers. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone! * The cream-to-powder formula is fantastic! I use it alone (no concealer, highlighter, bronzer, blush) and it works great to cover up my acne scars and even out my complexion. However, I have noticed that it breaks me out really badly. I wish there was a clean formula for this type of product. * Right texture for me"

It goes on smooth and doesn't feel cakey.  It's not drying like most tinted moisturizers.  It has more of a matte finish, I prefer a little shimmer (like the Bare Minerals tinted moisturizer).  This one doesn't last all day but is still a good tinted moisturizer with SPF 25.  A little pricey for the size so I would only buy it with a coupon. * I have normal to dry at time skin… I have tried every method to apply this and nothing works. It's blotchy and accentuates any dry areas. Save your money if you have skin like me. * Blended in perfectly with my skin and gives an amazing natural glow. Exactly what I was looking for, for Summer. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This product claims to be a ""Primer-infused for all-day wear & a healthy glow, this SPF tinted moisturizer gives you lightweight, natural-looking dewy coverage that hydrates skin for up to 24 hours.

The packaging is pretty standard compared to other all in one tinted moisturizer with SPF. I received the color fair, which was a little yellow for my skin tone. I swatched it on my cheek, it wasn't quite so yellow once blended into my skin, but if you look closely at the photos after blending, it did not apply smoothly and enhanced my pores and facial jaw lines. Almost immediately. This was a bit of a bummer because I had been looking forward to trying this product because I like multifunctional makeup. It also contains talc, which from what I understand is a debated topic currently. I tried to avoid talc containing products because if there's a chance of mesothelioma, I just don't want to take any unnecessary risks when there are similar products on the market, talc-free. I find it a bit suspicious that companies have started swapping l talc for other ingredients like in products like baby powders. So I have heard it is generally not recommended for application to the genital areas as there is some risk. 
I'd just rather not put an ingredient like that on my face or near my eyes or mouth. I wonder if one day we'll find out it was indeed harmful. In companies I've known this all the time, but took very slow action to remove talk from their newer products. I really wish that companies would be more transparent with things like this. However, these situations have repeatedly occurred throughout history so I decided to inspect my makeup.

I am incredibly picky with my foundation, and this is thr only one, high-end or drugstore, that i wear. Please, never stop producing it.

I have pretty good skin and got away from using foundation. I just use tarte shape tape under my eyes and around my nose/chin for redness. But I wanted a little something just to enhance my skin. Everything either has sunscreen in it which I do not want or looks like like I put highlighter all over my face. This does not have any shimmer or glitter like the CT Hollywood filter. This provides minimal coverage but gives your skin a glow. You can always spot conceal if you have a blemish and this goes nicely on top. I can also see using this under or on top of higher coverage foundation for a dewy look. If you have extremely oily skin I do not think it would work but for normal to dry its beautiful. The thing I can compare it to most is milk makeups skin tint, but that clings to dry patches and separates. This does not, its perfect! * I love this brand. * Love this product! So glowy! I wear this instead of foundation and it works perfectly! * I am returning this product. I gave it a try but it is sooo greasy and I usually like a more glowy foundation. Less coverage than a bb cream lol and needs soooo much powder to keep it on but stays kinda sticky. I hate it lol * Ive been using this for about a year and a half now, and i love it!!! 

I switched when I found out my E.L.F glow was making me break out. Ive had zero problems since then! 

Im not a foundation or full coverage girlie so putting ny consealer ontop of this really does give me the full face make up look, without feeling sooooo heavy."

I wanted to really like it but it didn't work for me * I love this foundation, its like your own skin but better. * At this price I'm pretty disappointed. Color match was great and does not oxidize, but that's where the pros ended for me. Definitely not full coverage, didn't blend well and shifts/splotchy. If you're an oilslick like me… this is a total waste. Maybe good for dryer skin? Going back to Dior at this price point and won't be purchasing this one again. * This foundation brought out texture and wrinkles I have never seen before. It is not very blend-able, as it takes a lot of manipulation to look somewhat acceptable. This product is very drying and I have oily skin. Not to mention it does not adhere to the skin, it slips and sides off your face throughout the day leaving you patchy. * I finally found my holy grail foundation, I didn't even buy it at Ulta but that's how much I loved it to write a review. It feels like I'm wearing nothing, it matches my skin perfectly which has been a nightmare for years trying to find a good match. * This coverage is a lot more sheer and dewy than I had anticipated. This would be a beautiful foundation for someone with dry, mature skin since it does not crease. The colors are not accurate either. I suggest ordering one to two shades darker. * I need to keep looking. I have a full bottle that I hope to find someone that it works for."

I would prefer pump packaging because with the twist-up you can't gauge how much you're dispensing, but I can get past that. Great, unsung foundation! * Great job on covering the blemishes. * I am picky about color shades and there is Many colors to choose from * It worked like a greasy highlighter on my face, highlighted flaws I didn't know i had. Although I like the sheer and shimmery tint I didn't find it useful enough to keep it. * I love how it goes on. Looks great on my skin. * As a pale girl I NEVER can find foundation that's fair enough.  Not only is this a shade match, but the wear is smooth and pretty- and it's hard to mess up the application.

It feels so nourishing and applies so evenly. It's light yet gives a good medium coverage. A great summertime weight. Not heavy but yet just enough color. Love it. Buy it. Give it a try. I think you'll like it. * This foundation is so perfect for me. It blends perfectly into my skin. It's so easy to apply. I just dab it on with a beauty sponge and I'm done in minutes! 
I love it ❤️ * I'm not sure why my skin reacts to foundation so terribly, but even the luxury brands make me look a little off. I know my undertone and have been able to pinpoint my exact color profile, so it's not that. Foundation usually sits on top of my face, amplifies my fine lines, and makes me look like a hot mess. Age Perfect Tinted Balm is the only foundation that makes me look better, and I wish I knew about it sooner. It's my favorite! * I have what the skincare industry refers to as ""mature ""skin. I am a make junkie and I had many foundations from drugstores and major department stores but as I got older they all made me look cake and settled into lines. I stumbled on this product and I love it. It's my skin only better. It lasts almost all day on my  combination oily dry skin. It is a wonderful product with light medium coverage for mature skin. Will definitely buy again * I've used 3 pots of this now and I'm still somehow surprised by how nice it is. The formula feels like it won't cover much, but it softens the appearance of/seems to fill and even out pores, scars, wrinkles, or any textures--I often get compliments on how smooth my skin looks when I use this. I've gone back and forth between two colors because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the color match is a little difficult. All in all, I keep trying new foundations just to come back to this one and be impressed by it. * I'm a light-medium skin tone that leans towards cool. I got started on this because an influencer raved about it a few yrs. ago. I decided to try it and couldn't had been more thrilled. I use shade fair 20 for reference. In the pot it looks more like a peach shade. It glides on effortlessly and melts into my skin. My dry/mature skin looks healthy. I'm sure I will get tired of this foundation, but for the last 3 yrs. I've been pleased. Only time will tell. * I was very skeptical to try this and was shocked. It is so good. 47 year old combo skin, apply with real techniques dense brush and its better than high end.

I actually found it quite drying. I love HG products and am so glad Ulta is carrying them. I hope they'll carry the newer HG skin tint so I can try that one. * Im 55 and my skin is very dry, this product is moisturizing and never settles in my pores , an excellent alternative to foundation which just sat on my skin, this tinted moisturizer does not do that. I would highly recommend this product- * I have never had so many compliments about my skin since using this tinted moisturizer! It may not be for anyone needing full coverage makeup but someone looking for a glow and slight coverage! * It was very hard to find something for my aging skin that is full coverage, but doesn't settle into lines and look caked on. this was recommended in store and I absolutely love it! I apply with a beauty blender and use shape tape concealer with a tiny bit of setting powder. Really makes a difference being hyaluronic and any pictures while wearing come out great. A must in my drawer. * I wanted to like this. I have dry skin and some creepiness at 52. This made all of that worse.

It's very thick and kinda hard to blend out even with moisturizer and primer. 
I had to return this and buy the Too Faced brand hydrating liquid foundation. * Several comments said this was medium to full coverage which made me want to try it and it is not. There is absolutely no coverage at all. If anything it's just a glorified moisturizer so I'm thinking those other comments were for a different product. * Absolutely one of my favorite foundation.

Also great for touch-ups when mineral foundation SPF is needed out in the sun! The closing latch wasn't super secure but I never had a problem with it opening in my purse. The new design is thick and super heavy. It's beautiful to sit on a counter, but useless weight for travel or carried in a shoulder bag. So sad I never odered backs up of the slim gold-tone compact! * I was surprised how expensive this compact is. But I have had so many contacts break and then I get crumbled pressed powder. This one looks like it will hold up well. I will let you know the first time I drop it-Yikes! * Very happy with this new compact. My JI mineral foundation stores securely,  the compact opens easily and now has a mirror. Yay! * I am a loyal Jane Iredale brand user. In fact, I have been using their products for over 20 years. The Jane Iredale line was recommended to me by the surgeon who did facial reconstruction after skin cancer surgery. 

Although I love their products, I have always been ""ehh"" about their packaging....until now! Thanks for finally giving up the gaudy gold (sorry, Jane Iredale) and going with this new, modern and aesthetically pleasing line of packaging. Since I have several of the old gold compacts, including the gold metals ones, I ordered one of the new compacts to see how I would like it. After receiving the new compact, I cannot wait to replace ALL my older versions! 

One more suggestion... in your future development, please consider making your eye shadows available in refills. I love the idea of being kinder to our planet and saving on the excess packaging. I do not mind paying separately for the cases if I know if is making a smaller, greener impact for future generations. =)

One final note of thanks to Ulta...I have been begging my local store to start carrying Jane Iredale. I am glad to see that you are at least finally carrying this amazing, clean line of makeup online! * I bought this on sale and I'm glad I did. It just makes it nice to put your foundation in. For the price of the foundation, it's a shame you have to purchase compact separately. * This packaging is overpriced and by default should be included with the powder. Waste of money."
147,nudestix,tinted cover foundation,pimprod2008837,2552723," * Overall I really like this product. I have sensitive skin and eczema, but this does not irritate my skin. The only thing I dislike is the initial smell when first applied - it has a strange medicinal smell. The smell goes away 15-20 minutes after application but it's strong when first applied. If this product was truly fragrance free I would give it 5 stars. * I have been upping my skin care regiment to combat hormonal acne and hyperpigmentation so my skin has been looking very nice. Thats where this product shines! It's very hydrating and lightweight so it looks like radiant skin! * I actually love this foundation bc i have blemish free skin and us it to even out hyperpigmentation. The issue is the pump… it does not pull product well after tube is no longer full and it doesn't come off. So its just wasted product. * Of course it doesn't fully cover blemishes, its not full coverage. I buy this again & again & pair it with concealer for under eyes / blemishes , & blush. Its so smooth, never breaks out my acne prone skin. I love it so much!! * Honestly I hate foundation, I have super sensitive skin and anything can break me out easily. This foundation is SO NICE!! It is more like a skin tint than a foundation, which I prefer if I do ever wear it, the smell is relaxing (if you're not an essential oil person I wouldn't recommend, the lavender is pretty strong), and it doesn't feel like anything is on. For my Florida girls this stuff is a great quick fix for the hot and humid days!! * I have super sensitive, rosacea-prone skin & my eyes are really easily irritated by makeup (ocular rosace) that started a few years ago - suddenly I couldn't wear my favorite makeup without breaking out, & my eyes burning, bright red. I searched & finally found a brand specifically for rosacea-prone skin! So happy to be able to wear makeup again! Over the last year or so the formula clearly changed - I couldn't find a color match & then my eyes started to  burn again. Back to the search - finally found this - I love this foundation & the whole product line! It's light & looks great - as others have said, I look like myself, only better! It doesn't settle in my lines or pores, doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It does feel a bit oily / has a bit of shine. Also, Nude 3 is a perfect color match for me when it goes on, but it does darken a bit across the day so I'm going to try 2.5 & save 3 for the summer. Otherwise, highly recommend!! * I bought this foundation and love it.  I'm 47 years old with dry and pigmented skin from aging and I like light coverage products due to aging skin look more natural than full coverage foundation.  Very moisturizing.  I still set with loose powder and yes would buy this as long as nudestix still made this."

149,uoma beauty,say what?! foundation,pimprod2033346,2593663," * I was so impressed with the color matching. This matched perfectly. Unfortunately, it was pretty watery. After a lot of shaking, it seemed to dispense properly, but the formula is pretty thick. It dries almost instantly and makes blending difficult. I also felt that it emphasized fine lines and wrinkles on my very dry skin. * overall the wear of the foundation wasn't bad, but my skin was red and inflamed when I took it off and I don't typically have sensitive skin and this was the only thing different in my routine * I like this brand and what little of this foundation I put on my face went on smooth and dried well. but it smelled so awful I couldn't use it! I didn't see reviews that mentioned the smell so I'm wondering if I got an old/bad batch…which would also be concerning. Disappointed but returning this * I have a hard time finding foundation due to an olive undertone, with silver being a better jewelry color for me. I purchased the Fair Lady T1N and this just.. it's awesome. It does dry down fast and blending becomes near impossible after, but with my combo skin, this is wonderful. I live in Maine and this foundation doesnt budge in the winter or the summer. One thing I will say is that if you have dry skin, this foundation won't be user-friendly. I typically have oil on my nose and forehead, with a dry chin. I lightly exfoliate my face, apply toner, then follow it up by a light non-cream moisturizer, and that solves the problem. * I was hoping this product would perform close to the Becca foundation that you can no longer get.
It's OK but not a go to foundation. It's more watery in my opinion and coverage has to be worked on quite a bit. 
I am sorry, but for me it's not what I was hoping for. * I dont teally wear foundation but gor aome reaaon wanted to try  this one and it was on sale . I am SO happy with it ! It wasnt heavy and it didnt cake up !  I am beyond happy * I LOVE this, I currently have 9 foundations(yes I counted) that I rotate through and I wish I found this sooner. I love how it lays on my face and makes my 42 year old skin look amazing. I will say that it will pill if you do not let your primer set."

So easy to apply and sets beautifully with a setting spray * This is my favorite powder foundation formula and has been for years - goes on so smoothly and is buildable. The last few compacts I've bought have cracked from barely any use. I had to dump the powder into a different container and use it that way. * so I do a full face every day. every once in a while I'll ""cheat"" and use this product to save time. it works sooo well. I use a light shade which I chose by pretty much matching my neck/highlight areas and use it mainly in my T zone. highlighting under eyes, forehead between brows chin and then I also add it along my jawline. then I go about my routine as normal but without the need for foundation highlight and baking. saves so much time! it builds well and has amazing coverage. it lasts all day. I have mature skin and hate when things settle into fine lines and wrinkles and I do not have that problem with this. it actually makes my skin appear younger compared to my full face routine with baking etc. I know I hav to find a new foundation to help avoid it but who has the time lol anyway... YES. this product is one I want to hoard in case it ever goes away. it's amazing. I use it with a compact dense brush. 

only downside is that I broke 2... but it's because I throw it in my purse and I know that's not ideal and on me for being careless. but if it's getting tossed around, be aware the powder may break. * This is a must have in my kit! I use it to lightly set my foundation and it transforms my face! I have also used it as a powder foundation for summer days and it is flawless! * This is the best powder foundation i have ever tried, i reach for this one over my high end one. Its my go to during the summer months. * Medium to full coverage. I like to carry it in my bag for touch ups because it covers the redness around the nose, i can cover up some my blemishes that peak out after wearing makeup all day etc * I use the shade Natural and I absolutely love this powder. i've used mine all the way to the pan and just restocked a new one. Literally the most beautiful blurring coverage, doesn't feel cakey or drying and my skin looks flawless. Great for on the go and quick touch ups. I usually hate the feeling of wearing heavy foundations and powders so once I found this it was over. Super breathable and comfortable and evens out my skin tone in a couple quick pass overs. I love this product."
151,revlon,illuminance skin-caring foundation,pimprod2036478,2605534," * This is better than expensive brand that claims to be skin caring. Does not oxide. I also find color matching my skin is challenging, but I found a shade that perfectly matches me in this line. * I love this foundation, I'm on my third or fourth bottle! I like that it is paraben free, affordable, has beautiful natural looking medium coverage, is hydrating, and actually has shades that match my medium yellowy-olive skin tone.
It looks like my bare skin but more even. I can't speak to the longevity because I don't really pay attention to that, haha. 
Yes it does totally smell like what you would paint your wall with! I'm willing to put up with it for an affordable paraben free option that actually matches my skin. * I love this and would buy it again... only a shade lighter. * Got this foundation about 2 weeks ago… just don't even look into this product. Maybe l'm having bad luck but it smells like paint, it creases SO EASILY I have to powder my face immediately after just to avoid it and then it STILL creases. The foundation comes off way to

152,dior,forever natural matte velvet compact foundation,pimprod2045605,2625554," * In fairness, I have used only loose powders for over 15 years- so I am used to a more sheer look. I typically love Dior products and the reviews made me think it could work. Definitely not for me. I am in my early 40's and this set right into every wrinkle on my face and just looked flaky.

153,pacifica,kind tint tinted serum,pimprod2030679,2591360," * It's okay. Nice to have lightweight coverage. But I worry about talc as an ingredient, given it's link to cancer. * I haven't experienced peeling, but very dry. I found no moisturizing properties. * this dried my skin. I tried it using a sponge and with my fingers and almost instantly dried on my face making it very flakey. unless I was using it incorrectly... I would not purchase again * I was looking for a light skin tint/tinted moisturizer. I picked this up and tried it out. It started flaking off my face as I was putting it on. I tried to add lotion to it, but eventually just wiped it off because if kept peeling * I was excited to try this because the color is nice and I never find shade matches. The claims were cool too— skincare focus!

However, no matter the prep or primer or brush or sponge or tool or skincare or whatever mix of things.. it pills and pills. If not pilling (which its hard for it not to), its so patchy. * I was excited to try this because the color is nice and I never find shade matches. The claims were cool too— skincare focus!

154,revlon,illuminance serum tint,pimprod2042614,2618859," * I decided to try this based on a review by an influencer and I am glad I did! This is super light - ""your skin but better"" kind of product which is exactly what I go for when I do my makeup. It gives you a fresh look with a dewy finish but not overly shiny. I was able to find the perfect shade which is super exciting. Seems that most brands tend to offer a lot of cool and warm tones but not many neutral options. Shade # 313 was a great match! * Moisturize well but it's beautiful. Covers redness, sun spots. Pretty impressive for drugstore! * sigh * I fell in love with this tint. I have tried so many from Ulta, from the drugstores and I will tell you ... it's exactly what it reads.... it's a SERUM with Tint ! Not a tint with serum !! big difference. This product is more skin than makeup. Get it !! * At first I liked this tint, but the more I used it I noticed how streaky, oily, and cakey it looks. I have dry skin but it's so sticky no matter how much I set it with powder. Also, there's literally no coverage. Obviously it's a skin tint but there should at least be some coverage. It also burns a little as others have stated. * After trying many skin tints, I came back to this one. With maturing skin, it instantly evens skin tone and leaves a youthful glow. It works well with powders and creams. It doesn't settle into any fine lines and feels so light weight. I barely feel like I have anything on my face. This has turned into my favorite foundation especially just in time for summer! * Seems to give a healthier glow!"
155,covergirl,clean fresh skin milk foundation,pimprod2011577,2556836," * Just so so. I wouldn't go out of my way to re purchase it again. It's super runny and it broke me out a little bit. I don't usually break out or have sensitive skin. I don't like the smell either. * This creamy foundation applies smoothly and evenly while blending with my choices of concealer (yay! doesn't seem to matter which brand). * This broke me out the worst I've ever seen it gave me huge painful cystic acne :( the coverage was pretty good but it has an odd smell. * I love that first and foremost its cruelty free, I think vegan too. It's affordable and so pigmented. I have oily skin but with the right orimer this does wonders. Try using the pink wet n wild primer. Coverage is amazing and LONG LASTING. ALL DAY (well at elast 10/12hrs) Please never discontinue it * This is the one for me. It has medium coverage on me , it doesnt look cakey. I love how long it lasts and makes my skin look fresh dewy but not oily and shiny. It pairs well with my lawless concelear and all my powders. I truly hope they never get rid of this line. I have stocked up on my shade 570 * I have other high end brand foundation...but this one right here is THAT GWORL!  I love the shade of this foundation...it's a perfect match to my skin.  And the absolute best thing is that it keeps my skin looking fresh and dewey the entire day. * I picked this up from ULTA (In store) beauty at 90% off and  just ordered 3 more.  I love everything about this foundation.  I mostly love the dewy finish."
156,covergirl,trublend matte made liquid foundation,pimprod2000386,2533518," * I use the foundation daily and I would definitely recommend to someone who's on a tight budget. only thing is it is easily transferable and doesn't stay on variable. It also looks a bit cakey but i highly recomend spraying do we setting spray onto your brush/sponge, and then blending out. * I normally wear Estee stay matte foundation but I was out and until it arrived I needed something in the meantime. I wore this out, was standing in the parking lot talking to my friends and some random lady walked up to us and said ""sorry to interupt but I just have to tell you, you are stunning"" ( she was talking to me) And then she walked off. I was never told that when I wore the Estee! What the heck, this stuff is GOLD. * I have been using this foundation for 5 years now. I will say it is not full coverage but it is buildable. This foundation feels so lightweight & it gives such a natural look. I've tried other foundations but always come back to this one cause its just so good! I tend to have an oily T-zone & everywhere else is pretty much dry but this foundation doesn't ever really cake or flake on me. I 100% recommend this foundation for an everyday natural look! * I love this foundation! it's affordable and stays on all throughout the work day * this foundation is surprisingly good for the price. it's buildable, smooth, and has a nice matte but natural finish. it flaked on my chin area after a few hours, but that could be my skin type. * Love this for my combo skin. I'm not extremely oily but I needed something that would actually last throughout the day without needing to powder by midday. I actually like it better than the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I am shade 090 in Lancome but have not been able to find a good color match as 090 is too light and the next shades are too dark and orange. I have very fair neutral skin. I prefer how the covergirl looks, it is very smooth with slightly better coverage, and L20 is a great shade and a closer match than the Lancome (maybe L20 is a dash too light but it looks perfect after bronzer). It gives a natural matte finish that doesn't cling or look cakey. Works well on my middle-age skin with fine lines. Has great medium-full coverage. Highly recommend! * I really love this foundation and I will continue to purchase it! Affordable and covers well."

(second guessing myself) I went a sister shade lighter and It was a little less noticeable but it still made me yellowish orange so I mixed it with a different foundation to see what would happen and it fixed the issue for me but for those that wanna know by itself it shifts color when dry but it's still a light smooth waterproof formula.. 
might I add,  what might not work for me might work better for you, it's always best to mess around and find out * This is honestly a really good sheer foundation. Its not full coverage but percect for the summer needing something lightweight. Shade match was surprising good. I would definitely buy again * Not good. Coverage is pretty bad. Watery. Dont buy * Great product * Great for the price but doesn't stay all day but the shades are great they just need more for other skin tones."

It feels extremely velvety. It is matte without being drying, which is also hard to do without talc. Hoping that they bring this back. You can use it as a powder foundation and a tinted setting powder. There is something spectacular about this formula. Really hope Elf brings this back. * After seeing many amazing reviews, I came here, excited to try this. But sooo much disappointed when there is no shade available for me, not even a close shade. * So overall if say its a good product if your a oily skin and combination skin then its pretty good buttt the shade range needs work it goes from a fair skin shade to a tan walnut color so id say maybe add more shadess ! BUT I DO LOVE HOW THEY INCLUDED DEEPER SKIN TONES * This works so well for my skin when I want to beaty ""filter"" my face. But this is noy for dry skin. * It broke the second I tapped my brush on it. Then it was impossible to blend out on my face and ruined my makeup ): * I love this powder this is the best powder that I have discovered as of lately. Elf kills it with all the products they release but this is top tier. * I really wanted to like this product, but even though I moisturize my skin, it leaves randow streaks on my face, as if i applied it with a paint brush. And leaves weird marks on my nose that I cant blend out and have to literally use my nails to scratch off. I have oily skin and never experienced this with a powder foundation."

But it is great if you use it for concealer instead. * Bought on clearance just to mess around.  (Three shades so I could try contours.). Smells too terrible to even do that.  I have never theown away makeup I just bought before this.  I know it is on clearance but it should not be sold at all. * I loveeeeeeee this foundation! It gives me the full coversge that i need * there is a reason this was so cheap * Its darker and orange. I bought two of different color to see and both extremely dark and yellow and orange. * I don't leave bad reviews, but save your money. It doesn't matter the cost if it's literally unusable. The formula is very thick, dificult to spread, poor coverage and very patchy. The color is too light. I have normal skin."

I live in Italy and was introduced to this brand by one of my girlfriends.All of their stuff is amazing. This foundation is great but definitely runs a bit warmer than I expected. I'm usually light neutral or 35N and grabbed shade 30N, it was darker than expected and waaaay too yellow on me. * I love this foundation * I was hesitant at first ,because I just heard from this brand but I'm glad i gave it a try. And it was on sale 😁 felt good on my face. I used it and yes it was worth it the staying power  was good specially of your from az. * Have a hard time matching foundation to my skin tone and this matches me perfectly. It looks natural and has buildable coverage. For the price, you cannot beat it, I own foundations double the price and this is now my go to. Give it a shot. :D * I bought this like a month ago and I love it! You dont have to use a lot and literally your face is flawless. One of the things i love about this product is it doesnt dry out your skin. I got the shade neutral 25 and id say that its a mix of fair and tan. I also really love the application part of it, the wand is really nice!!! * Covers a lot without having to apply a ton. Love the application wand * I love this foundation I find myself reaching for it more  often than the others. it's not drying, not greasy,  the coverage looks like my skin but glowy, and not cakey. The kiko Milano powder is awesome too for baking BTW. This foundation is way very similar to TF Born this way foundation, (but not as greasy) kiko milano is underrated IMO. Yes I would recommend."
164,well people,bio stick foundation,pimprod2008575,2553269," * The old formula truly was the best, I looked forward to applying it every morning.  Blended like a dream, gorgeous satin finish, blurred imperfections, clean and fragrance free.  The color 1C was actually a cool tone, this new 1C is PEACH toned....very warm, and the formula change truly makes me sad....it's not the same. They ruined a perfect product. * I absolutely love this product! The smell is a bit strong and the application is a little off-putting, but it blends great and looks great! I found that instead of using a traditional primer like elf power grip, using a setting spray to prime made application easier and blending smoother. * My skin looked worse with this. Highlighying pores no matter how much or how many different methods i use. And shows every bump, dry patch, etc. its so weird. Like the opposite of why we wear makeup in the first place. So mad i was fooled that im writing a review * I have very fair and pink skin and have always had trouble finding foundations that match my tone, never mind work well on my oily/combination skin, but I will say that this one does a good job! I was nervous buying online without match testing, but I got the 1C and would say its a pretty good match for my skin tone. 

My pros for this are definitely: generaly matches my skin, works well with my oily/combination skin, it coming in a stick format is very convenient and mess free, stays on very well, looks natural, and doesnt make my skin feel gross

My cons would be: not the perfect match (wish the undertones were more p and that the shade was slightly lighter), can get a little cakey if i put too much on, and a little hard to blend. 

For context I've been wearing Too Faced Born this way foundation in the shade Snow for years now because it's the only foundation I've found that comes close to matching my skin, but I've always run into the same problem of not being able to apply the foundation too thick because then you can tell it's not a true match. Anyway, I would say overall thi one does a better job, has better ingredients, feels better on my skin, and is a good price point.

My last points would be dont let the 1 star reviews scare you, this foundation is very nice and as long as you use a wet sponge to apply and don't mind the mild scent of castor oil that fades in about 30 minutes :) * The old formula was amazing.  Shade 1C was a perfect cool tone as described.  This newer version is very peach in tone and no longer qualifies as cool toned.  So  if you are a fair, cool toned person...look elsewhere. * I have come back to this product again and again after trying other hydrating foundations that are too thin and messy or settle into pores. This is my favorite non-SPF foundation. It is like a natural version of cover girl compact makeup. It's vegetable oil based so it does smell like olive oil. But it's so nourishing and convenient with the solid stick. It smooths on well to a medium coverage and natural dewy finish that doesn't settle into my pores or cause breakouts for me. And with a light powder to set, it stays all day. I do wish they had lighter shades as the lightest warm (2W) is a bit dark for me in winter. But I'm a repeat customer of this good clean dry skin foundation option. * This brand is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I live in the desert and ingredients like hyaluronic acid just pull the water out of your skin because there's no water in the air here. It seemed like every make up and skincare brand hopped on that train and I couldn't find anything for my skin (dry) and climate type. I hope they never change the formula! I'm almost 30 and I'm starting to get crows ft etc and this really does a great job of camouflage without settling in any wrinkles."

However since Kat sold the product off its formula has changed for the worse. I've tried the new version and it's awful I've tried fenti, tarte, double wear, and two others they all suck! * Mine always smelled like paint. Super thick, matte and cakey but superior coverage to anything made ever. * Please bring it back!!!! Nothing compares * My favorite and un replaceable foundation. I haven't found a similar to this one not one!!! This is the best foundation for OILY skin and tge coverage amazing. Loved that it last all day mind you i live in Az and the weather is HOT this foundation would not move at all. Pleas eplease being this back because Good Apple is not close at all in coverage and wear. * This was the only matte foundation i found that made my textred mature skin not look more textured and makes me look older like all other matte foundations I've tried! This one looks so amazing. Stayed all day and i sweat alot on my face. I really dont know why they got rid of this foundation. I literally have not one bad thing to say about this foundation.

169,lorac,pro soft focus longwear foundation,pimprod2013331,2558415," * I don't like to leave bad reviews, but this foundation was a disappointment for me as I love, LOVE their glass primer. First is that it came out very watery. I understand it is buildable but this was really runny. As others have said, it has a faint maple syrup smell - but for me it was maple syrup mixed with chemical. I am also having some kind of skin reaction and irritation since using this. Nothing major, but enough for me to not use it anymore after 2 uses. Lastly it did not last more than 4 hours. It smeared, creased and caked in areas on my face. Luckily I bought this on sale and just gave it to my niece. This might work for others but for me - no. Sadly their foundation does not live up to the quality of their glass primer - which for me is the best primer in all my years. * I was amazed at how full coverage it is! & how it dosent even look like im wearing foundation! I mean wow !! Definetly will be purchasing more! * I never had a Lorac foundation before, but I know the brand revamped so I thought I would give this a try. It did not dissapoint!!! I have roseacea and dry skin, and this worked amazing for coverage. There is a small scent but it's sweet and lowkey reminds my of syrup. Besides that there are no complaints from me. I would highly recommend using the shade finder tool to compare it to your current foundation. I'm an olive skin tone so it's hard to find foundations that are inclusive of that. I got a summer shade and a winter shade because  I love this foundation so much. Highly recommend! * I don't know if this is supposed to be runny as only a few reviews mentioned it but it's basically colored water & it's so messy. I will never buy this again. * This is my new favorite foundation,
! It has excellent coverage with a natural finish. I have dry skin but find a lot of the hydrating foundations transfer and/or leave my skin looking oily by the end of the day, this foundation looks good all day and doesn't transfer. It does have a incredibly potent smell that lingers long after it dries, but I have been able to get used to it and I only notice when during application. * Although I like this foundation in everyway I have to give a low score because it isn't CRUELTY FREE.   There is no good reason for testing on animals and there are plenty of good products available which ARE CRUELTY FREE too. * I purchased this on a whim as i saw it on sale. I received it at the same time another package with the new Prada foundation came in, and I'm shocked that i like the Lorac foundation more than the Prada!  I applied this with my Hourglass foundation brush as the formula is quite thin amd it went on beautifully. Its so smooth and the finish really is a soft matte. It seems to be very long lasting as well. My first favorite foundation of the year."
170,kiko milano,active foundation,pimprod2036981,2607365," * Ok, there are a lot of decent stick foundations out now (not great, but decent).  I don't think this is one of them.  It's the old school sort--the kind that feels very waxy.  If you have dry skin, you will not be pleased.  It's very hard to get the finish to look good, and even harder to get it to stay looking good.  It's probably not going to save you time or make your life easier on the go. * I am blown away by how amazing this stick foundation is!! It gives a barely there feeling which i love. It does not settle into fine lines and stays on all day. Can't wait to try more stuff from the brand!!! * This stick goes on sooo smoothly! Absolutely love the consistency of this makeup! My skin looked like a barely there makeup look, exactly what i was going for. Definitely need to extend the shade range of this makeup but other than that this stuff is amazing!! * great coverage for my skin tone and felt smooth.  please add more skin tones so all people can have it. * this shade range has every type of tone for lighter skin but for 1 dark complexion do better * I honestly dont unserstand why people who've never tried this give it a low rating due to the shade range. This is an Italian owned brand. Majority of the population is olive, light to medium skintones. Many of them/us have a hard time finding our shades. Go try Fenty Beauty if you dont like it. Anyways, this is fantastic. Super blendable and looks smooth on my texture. * the shade range is disgusting. its not like italy is a sheltered country or anything, many POC reside there. darker women, men, and all in between deserve to have products that fit their skin too. do better."
171,maybelline,instant age rewind perfector 4-in-1 whipped matte makeup,pimprod2028923,2590459," * Its like it never dries and doesnt stick to your skin. So skin ends up looking splotchy. Wipes off easily and blends with nothing. Won't purchase again! * I have combination skin, super oily with dry patches. I hate the feeling of foundation so I just prefer something super light to even out my color and mattify me. This stuff is perfect! It feels completely weightless and looks natural. It wears off gradually by the end of the day without looking crazy. Definitely my favorite face makeup! * It wiped off easily didn't  stay on my face. I would use it in a certain spot and i would try and apply it somewhere else and it would wipe off * As for color match, it's perfect. But it doesn't really cover up my imperfections like age spots * Looks great on my skin. * Very light coverage. Feels so light and soft on skin. Not oily after a full day of wear! Doesn't cover blemishes the best but will give a nice even tone over the skin. Blends nicely! * I loved this! Its very light weight. I used under this my normal skin car rountine. And i wear elf glow sunscreen and halo glow with this bb cream and i loved the result. I do use conceler as well. And i dont feel caked on. Honestly try this method."
172,flower beauty,get real serum foundation,pimprod2022967,2577491," * Pretty good coverage for a serum foundation, very dewy, very smoothing over texture. Hides my pores, my skin drinks this up. It doesnt settle into fine lines over time like alot of foundations do on me, I have dry skin. I dont know how this would hold up on oily skin, but its great for dry skin! Almost seems soothing for my skin, as it makes my skin very soft when I take it off, has been good for my acne as well. Good on dry spots and excema around my eyes!  Will probably need to set with powder as it is very dewy, but it looks amazing with powder too. Mixes well with other products. Only con is the shade range, not grear for pale girlies * Light coverage, runny. * I had the worst luck with ordering this both  times the  foundation bottle was broken and leaking everywhere also they should've put it in a cardboard box instead of a mailer envelope ,it was an absolute mess that I had to ask for a refund. * I wanted to like this but its sooooo oily right from the start. When I put it on it was very sheer and its not really something I can build up. Also it literally wipes off so there is that. * So good 😊 such good coverage only thing that I didn't like about it was that it was thick. * I am someone who likes a no-makeup look, and this is perfect! The product is very hydrating and goes on in a nice thin coat to make you look flawless and like you don't have makeup on. Unsure if it's buildable since I didn't try. Highly recommend! * I absolutely love this foundation! It is even better then the very high end products i have purchased.  Hydrated, natural looking skin is what my aging skin looks like when using it. I cannot believe what an absolute bargain this foundation is. I would gladly pay triple the price. I hope they never stop making it!"

It is so thick it won't pump out. The foundation is clumpy and doesn't spread at all. Why did they change a good product???? * This foundation is worth trying! Creamy, spreads nicely (I use a brush), nice colour matching (I consider myself a medium brown skin colour). Overall great product! * I cannot say enough GOOD THINGS about this CC cream. There comes the point when foundation is out, and CC cream is in, and I am pleased with this product's color choices, smooth texture, and luminescence. I mix two shades and apply the first color as a primer. This CC cream doubles as my concealer; it's that easy to apply. * This product: separates BADLY and doe not blend well at all; Smells weird and chemical-y; offers VERY little coverage, even for a CC cream, and is overpriced because of all these factors. Positives: it makes skin glowy and has SPF. I wouldn't buy this personally - Pacifica's skincare and fragrance are AMAZING, but makeup seems to be a weak point. * This product came out separated. Tried shaking product to get product mixed together and it came out somewhat like foundation. Does not go on skin nicely. Do not recommend. * it comes out as a clear oil with little specs of color that don't blend."

It is so hard for ne to find something that works for my skin and this has been amazing. * A gift card & a sale gave me this dream coverage. I am absolutely in love. This breathable, light satin finish can be set up on itself until youve found your inner teenage beauty queen! It's perfect for my skin type & it smells lovely too. A+ Ulta! * I love this lightweight easy to apply buildable foundation.  And so easy to match my complexion. * it appears that this foundation is being discontinued & I'm so upset. i have 51 y.o. mature, incredibly dry skin. this foundation is so wonderful & I have never found anything comparable. i need this in my makeup arsenal!!! * Please don't discontinue this item! It's the only foundation that works for my mature skin. It goes on so nice and smooth and cover just enough. Please please PLEASE bring back some of the lighter colors. * I bought this over the holidays and LOVED it!! Goes on easily and is weightless. Soooo disappointed to see that my shade is not available. Please do not discontinue this product. * My perfect shade is Light to Medium Cool.  Not available the last 2 times I've tried to buy.  What's up with that.  Not everybody needs a dark shade.  I would venture to say there are more who want lighter shades. Love the silky formula!"
175,blk/opl,true color mineral matte crÃ¨me powder foundation spf 15,pimprod2022221,2578383," * Great Product will buy it again. * This is the best. I was not expecting to fall in love with this product, but it's truly flawless. I have NEVER had a shade match me so accurately. This product is buildable and can be worn for 100% full coverage or as a tint. The color is pigmented enough to cover dark undereye without concealer for a very natural ""no makeup"" finish. The price is a steal lol * I have never had a more perfect color match in my entire life. I show this to the older women in my family and you would think I was literally doing a magic trick lol shock awe and wonder. I often and loudly recommend this in True Caramel. Perfect for lace on wigs or just on skin * The foundation is very smooth and moisturizing.  It provides medium coverage, so I build it by applying several applications to get a more full coverage.  It is a great product for the price. * I have purchased this product before and I liked it. This time the product was used. It had a finger smudge print on it when l opened it and the sponge applicator had make all on one side. I ended up purchasing something else at another store. * First, note this has the ingredients that Danessa Myricks uses for her foundation at an affordable cost. This provides a great shade match, makes skin look healthy and even, easy to take with you and stays on even if you sweat. The magnesium carbonate in the formula absolutely is wonderful for sweaty moments. I just find you can't really apply it with anything other than a sponge. Brushes with dense round tops don't pick it up well, as nothing else does. If you don't want to buy a beauty sponge you'll be fine to use the one it comes with. * Great shade for Hispanic women."
176,essence,keep me covered powder,pimprod2043728,2618266," * This is a solid foundation. The key is to prep your skin first. But prep I mean make sure your skin is well-moisturized and use a primer. * This is powder foundation, NOT setting powder. Make sure you moisturize and hydrate!!! well before applying. Test with primer to see which works well with it. 
I found this super easy to use and just faster than liquid foundation. I like it with Wet n Wild Glass Correct in green underneath over redness first. I also used a makeup setting spray after. 
I'm bummed it has poor reviews from people misusing it and that there's no light cool shades left. I just came back to buy another 2:( 
If you see it in store grab it for FOUNDATION,  it's good! * i absolutely love essence, but this is just not it. i wore this to school one time, and my face looked so white and flaky, and very cakey. you can tell the product is cheap, and that's not good. * I love this powder! On top of liquid foundation of course. It gives your foundation that extra boost and smooths out your skin even more. I have Extremely oily skin, I'm talking about im already getting oily an hour after I put my makeup on and this powder does not separate. I even use it to touch up my makeup and makes my skin look smooth and fresh and doesn't cake. best powder I ever used, works just as good as the Mac studio fix plus powder in my opinion. Get it! * The power broke during shipping. And it makes gou look evey ghostly. It ashes out anytning you have on your face * I have used this several times and it's important to remember this is a powder foundation, not a setting powder. it's fantastic when used over moisturizer and primer. also great for touch ups. it definitely looks cakey when not used as described. * This will seperate your makeup, does not look good on almost any skintone, ashy, cakey, and its extremely hard to open."
177,blk/opl,pore perfecting liquid foundation,pimprod2022248,2578400," * Ok so this foundation is good. It definitely depends on your level of makeup artisty but it does blend easily for me. The color is a little off for me but that may be my fault. I do mix it with another foundation. It's very creamy which i love. I have a face tattoo and it does a pretty good job of concealing. This foundation might not be for everyone but I do like it! * After researching this brand, I was extremely excited to try this foundation. When I first applied it the shade took my breath away! However, throughout the day it would smear and wipe off so easily :( * The consistency of the foundation is wonderful. It's super light and just melts into the skin. The color range is also phenomenal. I've never found a shade that matched me so perfectly. It literally looks like my skin. All of my friends, family members, and coworkers inquire about the foundation I use, and I have to share the link often. * Great foundation for the price. And it has spf! * Matched me perfectly. Wasn't to heavy made me look flawless * Rubs off and oily I bought two hoping to return one * After searching & searching for the perfect blend/shade…..I'm completely satisfied…."
178,l.a. girl,sheer skin tinted foundation,pimprod2025859,2581633," * YALL I SWEAR this is my holy tinted foundation i have ever tried. I have used maybelline bb fresh, covergirl skin milk, covergirl clean matte bb cream, colourpop pretty fresh skin tint, but this is the BEST AFFORDABLE, BEST SHADE RANGE tinted foundation i have ever tried. it feels light and looks so natural. i use shade WARM SAND. (for shade match reference: i also use loreal tinted serum shade 4-5 and the maybelline super stay skin tint in shade 220 & have oily skin) ANYWAYS YALL TRY THIS OUT ITS SO GOOD AND PLEASE NEVER GET RID OF THIS PRODUCT I LITERALLY BEG U GIRL!!! * i wanted something less full coverage, as it would crease in my smile lines, ans this does the trick! its a beautiful finish and lasts my full work shifts! no creasing either!!! * Why would the name be tinted foundation? Isnt all foundation tinted""? Maybe try tinted moisturizer * Light and hydrating product that evens out dull skin without looking heavy! Great for looking put together on minimal makeup days. * The coverage of this bad boy is wat too light to be called a foundation, but it doesnt have any skin care benefits which is I guess why they can't call it BB cream. It's refreshing to have a product with light coverage and a natural finish instead of dewy. Great for no makeup makeup days. * I found the Tawny shade of L.A. Girl Tinted Foundation in my local Ulta's clearance section and figured I'd give it a try. When I got home, I used Ulta's shade matcher and it told me I was really Warm Sand in this product (based off entering Ginger for bareMineral's COMPLEXION RESCUE Tinted Moisturizer Mineral SPF 30). Warm Sand perfectly matches my skin right now during the winter. I'll try Tawny again in the spring/summer, but it was a close match too. I love how lightweight this product feels and how easy it is to apply — I dot it on right from the tube and the dab/blend with a lightly moist makeup sponge. It looks just slightly dewy but doesn't feel overly wet or sticky. It also works well under my bareMinerals BAREPRO 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation if I want to look more made up, but between the price and its natural look when used solo, it fits well with my minimalist approach to makeup. * I am 66 years old. It settled into my wrinkles and emphasized them.  Very sheer coverage. Not a good choice for me."
179,well people,bio powder foundation,pimprod2008579,2553264," * Light, sheer. Shade range is confusing. If unsure, go a bit darker than normal. * I ordered 2W - Warm light - and it was almost white, so light and clearly defective. It did absolutely nothing other than make me have a Casper look. It is so sheer I can't imagine it doing anything even if it was the correct color.  I contacted Well People, I thought they should know how bad the product was, and they didn't care. * W3ll people... we need to talk about the shade range. People with darker skin tones like makeup too yet the shade range completely excludes anyone beyond tan. Thankfully the darkest shade works for me so I enjoy the product but it's hard to get behind a brand that doesn't give darker skintones a thought. * I was really hoping this product would work for me but it didn't. I found the baked foundation to be much more drying than other pressed powders I've previously used. Felt like it didn't go on well and had horrible coverage. Will not be buying again. * Takes forever to build up. Not for anyone who wants medium to full coverage. Light to medium at best. * Honestly if you're looking for a foundation to take a chance on.. this is definitely it. I'm not sure why I even chose to buy this but I love it!! I use it over concealer and it evens out my skin tone perfectly. Also does not make me look too orangey or cakey. * Just meh"

It was so easy to apply, felt nice on my skin, looks natural and I think m10 is my shade - it is spot on (for my beautiful summer complexion ) I'm excited to have found Mented! not a con for me, because i don't choose a makeup to smell good, but definitely seems like fragrance wasn't added.

I have pretty dry sky so I know to add a moisturizer before applying this. I am not saying this drying…but makeup ondry skin can appear patchy * This product feels and looks like you have no product on. * I have searched for the perfect match years! So excited to have finally found a shade so spot on with my skin tone that it's almost scary. The stick foundation is easy to apply, blends well and leaves me a great natural glow. * Looked awful on me. Horrible on oily skin and def dont get if you have light skin. This foundation isnt made for light skin tones which sucks. * Perfect match almost feels like a tinted moisturizer. I'm oily so I still need a powder but for stick makeup it goes on smooth and doesn't run off. I'm sold * Okay so hear me out.. the color match to my skin is amazing!!! it blended beautifully. However, I have combo oily skin and nothing could have prepared me for how shiny and oily this foundation is. This is not a matte foundation so beware!! * Hidden Gem hands down. I have been looking for a good foundation in general for a few years now, I went high end low end drugstore I went tinted moisturizer to full coverage and non did what I actually wanted. I love make up but finding a good foundation for my oily skin that wont force me to re touch (which I'm horrible at by the way, always makes it worse) was close to impossible without making me feel like I have pounds of make up on especially for work. I had tried the Hourglass foundation stick which was highly rated and felt very chalky on my skin. I did a search of stick foundations and came across this one. I am the lightest shade in this line and am on my way to re up for a 3rd time! I have never purchased 1 item more than once since they end up not working out for a while. The coverage is amazing from one layer to a 2 layers if I want a fuller look. It glides on like butter on my skin  and gives me a glow without an oily look if that makes sense. I rarely have to completely set my face because it sets so nice on its own and will literally last me over 9 hours without any cracks or separation and looks like I just applied it minutes ago. It makes my face feel hydrated and not like I'm wearing loads of make up. This is a long review and I never leave a review but I am truly in love with this foundation! I am so thankful for this brand because I am the in between when it comes to make up, I'm a semy fare complexion with neutral undertones. Many lines have a Yellow undertone or an olive undertone which makes me look washed out. This is truly a bang for your buck and will leave your make up looking flawless."

I have very pale, dry skin, this shade range cancels out any issues ive had with light foundations that are too orange, does not stick to or emphasize when i have dryness. I 100% recommend this product. * This doesn't settle in wrinkles like a lot of foundation.  It is a bit hard to use to start with but once you figure it out it's very nice.  Good for older and younger skin.  I'm 64 and it's the best I've ever used. * This foundation is perfect for evening out skin tone without making it look like you painted your make up on. I really love pairing it with cream contour and cream blush, and then just setting it with a setting spray- it gives a gorgeous dewy finish. You can set it with powder to make it a little more long lasting too. I always try to catch it on sale. I think having a gorgeous light coverage foundation like this is perfect for an interview, meeting someone new, or embracing your natural beauty! Its made me feel so much more confident in my own skin. * The origin to my villain story. I listened to an ULTA employee, first foundation for my high school homecoming. Three days later I broke out, having clear skin all my life. Ever since, it never stopped. I had to go on meds to cure my acne. Don't use. * I used to use the old face and body without the radiance and always loved it so im not surprised I love the new version especially because I like more of a sheen/glow to my skin. This is a very sheer coverage foundation but is buildable if you want a little more coverage. Also I can apply this over my skincare without it pilling! * I never tried the original face and body. Honestly, I was never interested in this foundation until I started watching Miss Megan Robinson on tik tok. Seriously you NEED to follow her!! I generally have oily skin. It's been a lot more calm, and a lot less oily after I got rid of all the actives, and JUST started washing, toning, and using AN OIL (I know right, but it's true, oil loves oil, using an oil will keep your skin from producing a lot of oil) I can now wear this foundation confidently, and it is BEAUTIFUL!! It's friction activated so I suggest applying with fingers and rubbing it in so you can start to feel the ""gripping and thickening"" action that happens with this foundation(which is the best most fun part for me). The coverage is obviously light but it looks like perfected skin. Only the best things are peeking through. Everything blends nicely on top, and I mean EVERYTHING, from all different brands. It wears great too and looks even better as the day goes on. Its softly radiant and skin like if you powder (which I still do) and if you don't you'll look like a freshly hot glazed donut (some people like that, some people don't) I get the hype of this foundation and dare I say it's made it into my top 5 line up!!?? Coming from an oily girl that is shocking. If you're wondering, I use the Danessa Myricks yummy skin balm in translucent as a primer, this foundation, all my other creams and liquids, and I set with Mac studio fix powder and one size setting spray. PERFECTED NATURAL RADIANT SKIN * Wear it everyday and have received unprovoked complements."
186,vdl,perfect lasting foundation,pimprod2006000,2560248," * I LOVE this foundation! It's definitely full coverage. It look so beautiful like natural skin! It doesn't dry matte, so definitely set it with powder. I'd say a little goes a long way! It last all day & still look beautiful even after a workout. The only areas that would slightly crease would be around my smile lines & chin but nothing crazy. I wish the foundation would be more available but it's so hard to find & the shade range isn't the best but overall 10/10 I would recommend! My closest shade is A05.5. I also tried mixing V05 & V04 to get my shade if anyone is wondering. I hope this helps.  :) * Coming from an Ulta Employee, after trying every foundation under the sun, this foundation makes my skin look FLAWLESS, airbrushed, smooth. I do have to set with a translucent loose powder because it is still a little tacky in my opinion. Shades are FANTASTIC. A02 matches me the closest; however if there was a slightly paler shade with a yellow undertone that would be my perfect match. I ordered A01 and A02 on YesStyle and to me 1 was almost darker than 2, but it may just be the undertones. ULTA PLEASE BRING THIS BACK. It took me over a week with express shipping on YS btw I paid $19 extra FYI In case anyone was going to order it, I think it ships from China. Idk what is in this foundation but  I want to buy every bottle just incase it ever gets discontinued😅😭😭😭 * My relationship with foundation is a nightmare,I'm a brown skin girl with golden undertones in the summer and pale skin in the winter,without much prep this foundation matched me perfectly and stayed on ALL NIGHT,the a night of dancing 💕LOVE THIS STUFF * Please restock ASAP! This is my favorite foundation!! I literally bought 3 bottles because I have a feeling Ulta might discontinue this foundation...
 FYI- you can still find VDL on Yesstyle BUT it's NOT the same foundation. The one on Yesstyle has SPF & it has more of a dewy finish 😩 * I hope Ulta is not going to stop selling this foundation. It is an amazing satin finish foundation. Looks flawless on the skin and makes blemished skin look smooth. Wears beautifully throughout the day and is full coverage. Highly recommend. FYI if they stop selling it at Ulta you can find it on YesStyle. * I bought this foundation in the color A06. I tend to have a hard time finding foundations because I am in the weird shade range where I'm typically between medium/tan and dark/deep in various brands. I have Neutral slightly golden/olive undertones and find that many brands get close but not perfectly my shade. Most times foundations are too golden (almost orange looking), too cool, exactly neutral when I need just a touch of yellow in the foundation, or they just skip my shade altogether. I was pleasantly surprised when this foundation was an exact match. I love the natural finish to this foundation. I have dehydrated combo skin that if not properly hydrated will get oily in the t-zone (mostly nose area) and will remain normal or slightly dry everywhere else. When I wear this for several hours my foundation goes from very natural to radiant but not oily as my t-zone starts to break into a bit of a shine. I really don't have anything bad to say about this foundation except because of the limited shade range there's a chance you may not find a good match depending on your skin tone and undertone. Hopefully Ulta continues to keep this foundation available. * I would describe this foundation on my skin as full coverage with a satin/slight dewy finish. I have acne prone skin with acne scars and this foundation covers everything without causing any texture. Long wearing and mask proof. Doesn't cause breakouts. Would recommend for various skin types."
187,l'orÃ©al,age perfect creamy powder foundation,pimprod2021675,2569747," * Very light, silky powder texture. The ""creamy"" title is very deceiving though. It's powder. And quite drying immediately on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this for aging skin whatsoever. Great product for on the go touch ups on oily skin. * I don't care for the sponge applicator because it really doesn't go on right, but I found that using a brush to apply is so much better and it goes on more evenly.  You can add more where needed without it looking blotchy.  I love it! Used the color Sienna * Goes smooth and cover some imperfections, but looks natural. Leaves your skin soft and beautiful. * Lightest shade, Ivory.  You MUST prep the skin with moisturizer, sunscreen and either CT Hollywood Flawless Filter or the Maybeline knockoff or a dewy primer or sunscreen.  Buff in with a brush after applying concealer where needed.  Use powder bronzer, blush and highlight and a setting spray.  It looked amazing on my 48 year old dry skin and lasted all day.  Not powdery, didn't settle in lines, let's your skin peek through (is light coverage).   I really love it. * I thought since it's called age perfect it would be a moisturizing creamy powder. Nope. It's super drying and I have combination oily skin not even dry. Feels horrible right on application You can feel the makeup. Didn't blur anything. I had to take it off within 10 mins of application. Don't buy this stuff. * I wanted to try a cream to powder foundation to try to cover some dark spots. 
This covered what I wanted. It does look a little dry after application but I'm oily so it looks more natural after a few hours. * I love the age rewind concealer and seen this after looking for a good powder foundation. it is a really creamy, finely milled powder. I don't think it's really pigmented but you get enough coverage to even everything out and in my opinion it really does blur. I use a flat top Kabuki brush to buff it in, slowly building up layers. I take product and tap it in where I need more coverage with a concealer brush. I find I get the most coverage this way. it's like your skin but better. gives you a nice natural finish and doesn't look cakey if you slowly buff and build. will be trying this as a setting powder for liquid since it blurs. it also doesn't make me breakout!"

Unfortunately, This product didn't work for my dry skin. And for the price I doesn't have great coverage. I don't see this product any different from any other pressed powder. Also, this powder has sparkles in it I guess to conceal how drying and powdery it makes the skin.. * I love this powder, my skin is dry but this powder always feels comfortable on, never adds any texture as other powders have for me in the past, def one of my fav powders * I LOVE this pressed powder! It takes away the look of shine and makes my skin look refined and even toned. I bought Ivory and it is the ideal shade for my skin tone, medium fair with pink undertones. It works well worn over concealer and foundation, or on its own. And, better still, it looks invisible and feels like nothing on skin! The mirrored compact is the perfect size for taking on the go and it even comes with an applicator sponge on a clear, hinged divider inside. Hynt thought of everything with this pressed powder! I will definitely buy again:) * I've always been reluctant to wear powder - most of the time I end up looking cake-y. This finishing powder is a game changer - so easy to apply and bonus, the packaging is so adorable! But more importantly my skin looks so velvety and super plump, definitely will be coming back for more when I'm through with this! * Love using this powder in-between zoom meetings to touch up my skin. Just gives me a more even/finished and natural look * One of my favorite products from Hynt * I used this foundation with the foam puff it came packaged with. Do not use with a brush, the powder is finely milled and will fall off your brush! I wore it over serum and moisturizer. My face got a little shiny throughout the day but that is common for me, as I have combination skin. I like that the coverage is buildable, I was able to apply two layers and achieved the coverage I was looking for. Best of all, the ingredients are natural and truly clean! No SLS, no parabens, no Lauryl Lysine, no Bismuth oxychloride! So happy Ulta is carrying this brand!"
189,hourglass,vanish seamless finish liquid foundation,pimprod2020422,2575785," * For a pro makeup artist, ( yes, you need to be a pro to know how to work with it) this is so far one of the best foundations that I have ever worked with. I recommend performing a gentle face exfolation before bed time and removing any peach fuzz for any makeup aplication, not just this foundation. It makes a huge difference in aplication and appearance of the final look/finish.
It works best with the Vanish smoothing primer. (To smooth down the pores that every human being has) It is runny but extreamly pigmented. Do not use too much or it will look cakey.Best apply with a dense buffer brush (Morphe 444 is my favorite) and then press it in with a beauty blender. I use the professional Kryolan setting spray first, and then set it with a good powder.( Jeffree Star, Fenty or Kryolan powder) It holds for 14h even in humid Florida. Best foundation for events. It's best for normal/ combination skin. I wish they had more shades.
Unfortunately it just has been discontinued, tho the company has gave me insites that they are working on perfecting the formula and making a new foundation for combination/oily skin (they currently carry luminous foundations for normal/dry skin) * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * This product is so thin & runny! Like water consistency. I pumped one pump on my hand & it literally dripped off me. I shook the bottle so many times & it still remained runny. I gave it a try on my face because I wanted to give the foundation a chance but the product just settled right into any crevice it could. I could literally see wrinkles/lines I didn't even know I had. * I got this during a sale and was so excited to try my first Hourglass product. I followed the instructions and reviews and only used a very little amount. It brings out my pores horribly, dries down very weird and makes my skin dry, and even though it feels light on my skin my skin feels a tiny bit sticky, not something I usually experience with prestige brand foundations. This is a miss for me. * This foundation is very reminiscent of Marc Jacob's 'Remarcable' . Full coverage and matte with a pore filling matte primer underneath . The bad reviews are really just people who don't know how to apply makeup . * Words do not explain how buttery this foundation is I have dry to normal skin and it blends it two to three glides. Will never use another foundation"
190,smashbox,studio skin 24 hour full coverage waterproof foundation,pimprod2009758,2552423," * Luckily I night this on a good sale a ways back but it is just not it. I have combo oily skin and so far regardless of the primer or moisturizer this just doesn't look good and will break down. I've been using juvias place which I like ten times better and I don't have to try to make it work. This foundation also oxidizes orange..so not just a shade but it'll turn more orange as well. I'm gonna try to find something to mjx it with but I won't be purchasing again and wouldn't recommend it. * I have oily combo skin, and this foundation did not stand the test of time. It felt very heavy, and transferred with the slightest touch (with setting powder). Only a few hours in, and it was breaking apart on my face, highlighting even the slightest texture. My pores were literally drinking this product up. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a foundation, and could not wait to take it off. * I have combo skin, I use the Bobby brown moisturizer primer underneath and only use a tiny bit with a brush. Looks flawless!! Do not use to much product otherwise it will look cakey, if you need extra coverage apply only to specific area with smaller brush. * 32f (no active breakout/indented scars only on cheeks/combination skin)This foundation has the worst formula I have ever used on my skin. I tried two different primers underneath and tried it on it's own and it just refused to settle or smooth out. It creases badly and makes skin look dry and caked with very minimal use of the product that looked worse and worse if you tried to use even a tiny bit more. Powders and setting spray do nothing to help. I tried beauty blenders and brushes and neither made it better. I ended up going back to a trusty Revlon foundation that was way cheaper and a much better formula. Do not waste your money if you do not have perfect smooth skin. * I have sensitive skin with large amounts of rosacea and occasional eczema. This product covers my redness very well, and can many my dry areas seemingly disappear. Smashbox was also a line that came up multiple times during my search for products best for sensitive skin. * Maybe this just doesn't work with some skin types. I've given this several goes with different amounts of product and application techniques and it always manages to cake up and accentuate every pore after it's settled. I decided to give this one more go, applying after a glowy moisturizer that managed to save some of my other cakey products and it still had the same issues after setting for about 20 minutes. * It has perfect coverage,  a very little goes a long way.  Love the Matt finish I got.  Like  all foundations,  you have to prepare your skin before you applying anything to it.  Use a brush to apply.  I patted it on."
