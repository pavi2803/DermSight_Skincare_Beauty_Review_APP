I would classify my complexion as downright greasy with visible pores within 30 minutes of walking out the door. The color match was phenomenal with no mixing of colors required. I own about 8 foundations and only one is an OTC brand that I use to mix and match to match my complexion. An added plus is the packaging. Nothing is wasted and easily portable. I never would have expected Urban Decay to be THE ONE. * The foundation bottle color seemed different when I applied it , I wouldn't recommend. * I was hesitant to buy this reading the reviews but i am so glad i did!! It works great on my skin and i really love it. Urban decay foundations work well with my skin. Things work so differently on everyones skin so If you want to try i say go for it, if it doesnt work take it back. * I had high hopes for this product, as it advertises having a built in primer and being waterproof. It is extremely cakey and splotchy, especially if you have textured skin. The finish is bland and just unflattering. * I am so impressed with this foundation! I have a very oily T-zone & this doesn't separate on me like most do. I still powder in those areas with a loose powder & puff btw! I love that it's ""heavy duty"" while being medium coverage & lightweight! * I have combination skin m, mostly dry.  This foundation is full coverage and stays on really well. I was in active labor for about 12hrs and pushed out my baby and this foundation stayed on!  The nurse in my post partum room even asked if I did my makeup right after delivering üòÇ I live on Arizona it's very hot and dry.  If you have combination skin make sure you moisturize really good prior to applying this foundation * amazing, I hardly get oily during my work day. Have been using it daily now."

If you have any kind of lines on your forehead, around your nose, mouth its goong to soak in those lines. Just the worst foundation i have ever bought which is extremely disappointing given the price and brand. * This foundation is top tier. Originally I was a little concerned about the fragrance but its been a few months and I havent broken out (I have ezcema too). It gives the most natural glow but doesnt make you look oily. No one can ever tell I'm wearing foundation when I wear this. The foundation looks best if you exfoliate your skin and use toner + moisturizer. I usually apply with my hands or spatula. I usually blend it out with fingers and/or a beauty blender. * Very heavy did not like plus it has a rare smell * This foundation dries my skin like crazy. I tried twice, on the 1st day with my regular skincare, and felt very dry after a few hours. On the 2nd day, I added layers of moisturizer and had the same results, so I am disappointed and definitely returning it. * Didn't like it at all no coverage and super watery. * I am so beyond thrilled and impressed with this foundation. Honestly, I don't think I could ever go back to another formula! A little goes a long way ‚Äî you literally only need 2 small pumps of product to cover your entire face with a luminous, ethereal glow. It blends like a dream and feels like another layer of skin. Believe it or not, I get SO many compliments when I wear it. People tell me my skin looks amazing when I have it on. It gives me so much confidence and makes me feel beautiful. The shade-matcher worked perfectly. I didn't even have to try on this foundation before I ordered it and it was a PERFECT match.

Buy it, buy it, BUY IT!!!! * I love the coverage.  I am 58 years old. The foundation does not sit in the wrinkles. I find applying with a sponge helpful."

5,5,5,5,lanc√É¬¥me,teint idole ultra wear 24h full coverage foundation,pimprod2039028,2608119," * I just bought this today, had to try it on right away and wow. It's so thin and blendable with just my fingers. It's not 100% full coverage at first swipe but a bit more than medium coverage. It's easily buildable and the overall coverage with just 2 layers on my big ol' pores and acne scars looked great. My large pores didnt look ""filled in"" with product.  My acne indentation scars weren't emphasized. I didn't color correct nor use any concealer and it just looked like my skin, but better. My own daughter said I look like I had a filter on. I paired it with the Lanc√¥me La Base Pro primer. Now, I just pray to the gods that it does not break me out! * I went into Ulta about to grab my usual skin tint; but as much as I loved it I knew how patchy it looked when my skin was dry . 

A helpful Ulta Employee helped me to color match, the shade range was right for my cool undertones . I nearly cried I never seen a match so perfect that didn't cover up my freckles . 

I admit I felt much more confident with it on as it contained my pink undertone.  

I subtract the price of Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E , if I would have paid separate.  in a sense the foundation was well worth the price . but I can understand how it will still be an expensive price point . * Stay away, my pale friends. I was hoping this would match the old one before they reformulated, but unfortunately its still too dark and very very orange. * Love this foundation! I have oily skin and i have tried countless foundations looking for one that isnt super shiny by the end of my work day. 
Paired it with the matching concealer and the La Base Pro primer and my makeup didnt budge all day even with the humidity. * I have tried many different high end foundations and could never find one that would truly leave me matte all day with a little touch up here and there. After reading the reviews on this one, I decided to give it a shot and lets just say I am super impressed! Not only does it stay looking flawless through the work day, it doesn't feel heavy at all. Usually by 5 pm my foundation is completely separated and just awful, but not with this one. I do recommend a good prep and prime routine though before applying! * This is by far the best foundation I've found in a while. I liked the old formula, so I was a little worried about the new one, but I am beyond happy with it! This gives the smoothest, poreless finish. It's a satin matte, which gives the perfect finish. While you can get full coverage, I like more of a light to medium coverage, and this delivers that very easily. I like to apply with fingers, then bounce a beauty blender over to blend. This is the smoothest finish I've ever found in a foundation. I have normal to oily skin, and this wears all day with no touchups needed, even in the heat. I'm obsessed, as a foundation junkie I'm always on the search for the next best thing, but this hits the nail on the head, I'm totally happy with this! Highly recommend! Also, I don't use a primer with this, just my skincare underneath. I find it melts into the skin more seamless without a primer, I do set with translucent powder. * New formula makes my skin dry, melts faster and only works if you use a good primer and setting powder :("

She was very knowledgeable of Mac products. * Ive been wearing studio fix foundation for ahout 16 years. I recently went into mac to get more and found out they had a new formula?! Why?! There was nothing wrong with the original one. Please bring it back!

My skin looks so bad with this new ""matte"" foundation. It dries so quickly and doesnt blend. I hate it üò´ * The original was PERFECT!!! Why did mac have to ""fix"" something that didnt neef to be fixed!!! This is MATTE it is NO LONGER a natural finish it is SO UNFORTUNATE‚Ä¶.. so disappointed. Settled in fine lines and dried on my skin‚Ä¶ looked HEAVY and CAKEY after literally 2 hrs in a house with AC‚Ä¶. So terrible. So upset. The original was the only foundation that worked for me in this tx heat. * I have been using Mac since 2016. The studio fix fluid foundation has always made my skin flawless even when i've had my issues with hormonal acne. Since switching to the new formula my skin has been so dry, and it looks and feels terrible. Could it be the only cause, maybe, but my skin has not been the same since switching. So upset‚Ä¶ * I wear NC10 and I really like the change in color from the old to the new formula. The new NC10 is just a bit less yellow and more neutral. However, the lasting powrr and coverage are terrible now. I wish they would bring back the old formula. Will not be repurchasing and would not recommend unless youre only wearing for a couple of hours or have flawless skin. * I hate hate hate this new formula, the old formula was the best and i feel like my shade isnt my shade anymore * I have been purchasing Studio Fix for 10 years religiously and this new formula is NOT ""new and improved"" for my skin, at least. There most definitely IS a difference and I am returning it today. I gave it a fair chance and it slides off my face. So disappointed. Feels more like a serum which is not what I want in this particular product. I need to find a new liquid foundation and go through a bunch of trial and error."

11,11,11,11,bareminerals,barepro 16-hr skin-perfecting powder foundation,pimprod2030155,2589559," * I went into the store completely set against Bare Minerals. I had in mind what I was looking for and didn't think they could come through. I needed something light weight and long wearing for the Florida heat & humidity. I was wrong, Bare Minerals, thank you!! My skin looks flawless. Color match is perfect and it glides on with my angled brush like BUTTAH and lasts AAALLL DAY! 

Only negative ‚Ä¶ the SMELL is horrible at first. I started with a completely clean, fresh brush - especially since I was trying something new (so I know it's not the brush). But let me tell you - I honestly thought someone left a dirty diaper somewhere. The smell dissipates so I will continue to use and again since my skin looks amazing.  Bare Minerals may have won me over! 

*I never leave reviews - this deserved one * I love this foundation. It's so light you hardly even know it's there. It's exactly what I was looking for in a foundation. Huge thanks to bareMinerals for the nice shade selection too. It's very difficult to match many brands if you have cool undertones. Love the selection! * Im surprised because I loved the previous formulation of the liquid BarePro and thought this may be great but its awful.  I have olive tan skin and their Medium 30 Warm was like a grey cast.  Its chalky,  breaks easily, very messy to apply with a brush, and somehow does not prevent shine at all.  It seems like it exacerbates my shininess much faster than any other formulation ive tried.  So sad. * It looks great on my mature skin. It looks very natural. * Expensive, but it goes a long way and provides good coverage. * I've been a Bare Minerals fan since they've been around but after they came out with a new formulation it's horrible. 

I broke out immediately after using it. If I could give it no stars U would! Never broke out this bad such a disappointment! 

Definitely had to return it and get my money back! * I struggle to find good color matches for my skintone. Finally found one in this foundation. It wears well and lasts during my 16hr shift. I find myself needing to blot a couple times a shift but I think that is more so because of my suncreen. I don't use the sponge, I apply with a brush. I will continue to buy this."
12,12,12,12,fenty beauty by rihanna,pro filt'r soft matte longwear liquid foundation,pimprod2029862,2592558," * It goes on really cakey and dries before I have time to blend it. It sits really heavy and doesn't build well. It oxidizes so much it makes you look orange. I would not recommend it. * i really like the look of the bottle. i really like the way it feels on the skin its extremely light weight like its barely there. i forget im wearing foundation. and i noticed its buildable without looking cakey. i also like how it can look radiant if you use a wet sponge rather than a brush, but still be a mattifying foundation. the shade range is really good. in fact there r two neutral shades that my skin matches to. i bought them both. 150 & 125. 125 my shade, and 150 was pretty much the same bit slightly warmer. they r way close so i said what the heck. 

anyway my dislike for these probably have to be the way it dries down and makes texture POP. like at the end of the day all base makeup is going to do that, as it really has little to do w facial textures that will inevitably show. bUt this foundation really doesnt seem all that seamless it accentuates all the textures and little hairs. my attempt to fix it was to purchase a facial razor and see how smooth this foundation can be bevause it reallt does look smooth and light and buildabke and pretty when applied in the beginning. but once its dried down its kind terrible and i wanna redo my makeup. :/ * I love the color and how easy it is to blend, however,  it makes every pore I have visible. Any line I have it shows. I would also say it's more light to med coverage.  It took 3 layers to cover dark spots. * Last week I spent over an hour in Ulta getting my skin tone matched with a new foundation (it's always hard to find the right shade for me). I was so grateful to the associate for being patient and helping me out! We finally found the perfect one, this Fenty foundation. It looks great, blends well, and isn't thick. The matte looks nice and not dried out or anything. Definitely a fan! My face looks flawless with this. * I think this foundation is overall great and the shade range cant be beat. However, as  Ive gotten older I defintiely have to use it with other foundations because it can settle into fine lines and make my skin looks drier than normal. Im looking forward to trying the luminous formula they just came out with! * The wide range of shades is such a plus. However, it does not help oily skin what so ever and the deeper the shades the more orange/red they become and the oxidation is awful. I think people only flock to this because it's RiRi but it's not worth the money, doesn't work. * Been using this product for 5 years love it"

Not only is this a huge win because it has SPF, but it also has the perfectttt medium lightweight coverage. Its been great for a good ""no makeup"" makeup look, its hydrating, and blends beautifully. * My new FAVORITE! Feels like skin. In shade Fair Porcelain it is light enough for me!!!!! Coverage is sheer. And it has all the goodness for your skin! Win! * I was shown this by sales associate that knew her stuff and matched me up perfectly. It works beautifully for going to the gym and not wearing my usual makeup.  I have found this to be easy to apply, fast and very pretty glow for my dry skin.  Very Pleased!! * I really enjoy this cc cream, i use the shade fair porcelain. I am so glad they expanded the shade range because i have heard so many wonderful things about the cc cream but never could use it because the shades were to dark for me. I wanted a light to medium coverage that had a natural finish. I find that i get that with this and it is eash to build from light to medium. I apply it with a damp beauty blender and it blends into my skin nicely. If you have very oily skin you may need to be careful with this as i have combination skin and i do get dewy at the end of the day. However i use a dewy primer and setting spray and i like that look. I like that it is better for my skin than traditional foundation and it has suncreen in it. I work 9-10 hour days and the coverage seems to last all day. I definitely recommend trying! Not a strong scent, lightly citrus * My favorite ever! I used to use the full coverage IT Cosmetics, but at 48 i felt my skin was looking flat. Lifeless. I tried this and will use it for life! Such light, natural coverage, and dewey. Not oily. Just right. * I was looking for a foundation that left my skin looking dewy. This does the trick, however I prefer a little more coverage than it provides."

It covered my mild roseccia well! If you have dark spots or more secerr redness you can combine this with concealer! 
I would highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for a light to medium buildable finish that diesnr settle in lines! Just make sure yiur skin is prepped first! EL never disappoints with their Foundations! * Small amounted needed to get good coverage. * Very moisturizing doesn't quite have the coverage of double wear * I really love the idea of a moisturizing sunscreen however this product separates for me and I've bought it twice and it happened both times.

It looks really beautiful. I plan on buying the lighter shade as well to use it mixed wirh foundation or as a highlighter in winter months . * This is my go-to product for no makeup makeup. It's enough coverage to neutralize most of my rosacea and even out my skin tone. It isn't going to cover major blemishes, dark spots, etc but that's the reality of a skin tint.

28,28,28,28,beautycounter,skin twin featherweight foundation,pimprod2038184,2606483," * This a wonderful foundation. It gives perfect coverage, making my skin look dewy and fresh.   The best part is that it is a clean product, without the bad stuff.I love this brand. * Not enough coverage for my aging skin! * Unsure. It's not like it's a bad product. I feel it's good quality. I think maybe for a lighter foundation could be a good find. I feel for the price, what my expectations were; not a good buy necessarily. Fell a bit flat for me. I've also only used a couple (2-3) times. Maybe it grows. My skin feels nice.
I don't feel excited afterwords-if that makes sense? Sometimes I put on foundation and I'm like ""OO-Hello there!"" I put this on and feel like‚Ä¶ehh. Best way I can put it. I did have a more positive prospective when adding a glow enhancer. It's ok. * I used this for about a year. I have combo/oily skin and this slid off my face whenever i went out. I would typically use a primer too and it didnt help. Also, it provides almost no coverage for me. All in all, defintely regret trying it. I will say, it adds a nice glow if your skin is in good shape and you stay inside. * I was looking for something that is light on my skin and it covers my pores , I just love this product. My skin doesn't feel flaky, it's not dry at all. * Good color match but finish was way too dewy looking and made my face look oily. * Skin twin is the PERFECT name for this foundation. It wears wonderfully with buildable coverage. It felt lovely on my skin all day and wore beautifully all day without caking or shifting. I am 28 with light redness, textured skin, and oily/normal. Skin twin for the win!"

Looks so natural that I  have people tell me how beautiful my skin is. My favorite thing about this product is that I can build it to my liking without it looking caked. * It was the perfect last step for my make up. Really helped to cover up some of the redness in my chin and nose. * So happy the sunscreen was removed. The increase in skin cancer since the sunblock/fear the sun campaign started, has skyrocketed. And our d has plummeted. Oral D, no good. Sun is above us for a reason, a VITAL reason. * I love the coverage and it's very easy to apply.  The only thing that I don't like is that I have oily skin and I am already oily within a few hours. * I use Fair liquid foundation so bough fair powder and the color does not match at all. The powder also does not sit well on the face. * I use all the CC products from IT. There is no other brand that minimizes my redness as well as this brand. I also don't have any issues with product settling in my fine lines and pores. * so impressed ! I have never been a powder girly. only liquid . and setting powder. but I love this ! you don't even need a lot. and it covers my rosacea ! love ! üòç and as a mama, so good for on the go !"
31,31,31,31,kvd beauty,good apple full-coverage transfer-proof serum foundation,pimprod2037872,2604570," * I'm in my mid 40's, so my skin has changed quite a bit since I started wearing makeup. My old ""holy grail"" Foundation no longer worked for my more mature skin. It took me SIX years to find something I really loved, and this is it. It's surprisingly lightweight for how full coverage it is and it stayed IN TACT for several hours in 100‚Å∞ weather on my skin. I had read that it could be drying on dry to combination skin, and I did not find that to be true. For many years, I was a silicone based primer girlie, and you absolutely need water based with this foundation. lt is also very necessary to swatch IN PERSON and let it dry down before you buy in order to get the right color match because the wet to dry color is often significantly different and it was impossible to tell what would be my best match online. * The shading on this foundation is not accurate. I have 4 bottles (i mix to get my shade, and am tanner/lighter throughout the year depending on the month) that I purchased trying to switch over from estee lauder doublewear, and all the colors have a yellow undertone despite the ""peach"" or ""neutral"" undertones for specific shades. 

The only plus is that this is an acne safe foundation, which allllllmost makes up for the color matching issue. It says it is transfer resistant which is not true at all. If i do my makeup at 6:30 am it transfers/moves around by 12, which is a bummer. 

I will probably still use it sparignly - being one of the only acne safe foundations, but all the cons make me want to toss it. I'll have to keep my estee Lauder foundation for now until they improve * Coverage: It's not super full coverage, when I look for a face product I want something that can cover 5 o'clock shadow. This product on its own does not provide that for me and I still need to go in with concealer in those areas, but I know I'm asking for a lot when it comes to coverage. That being said it's still a step above medium coverage.

Wear: I have combo skin, this foundation doesn't make areas of my face feel like a grease trap at the end of the day and the claims of it being transfer proof for the most part hold up. Also haven't noticed any separation throughout the day when I get oily. You have to be pretty aggressive to notice traces of transfer. It's a water based foundation so used a water based primer with it.

Shade: I have issues finding shades that match my skin tone. I have a neutral-olive undertone but I am also pale. the Shade 006 was a shockingly great match for me, I'm satisfied with that.

Price: It's worth it in my opinion. Passes a lot of marks for me, would recommend this product and will be buying again. * I recently went on a trip to AZ for a few days and oh my god this was so beautiful, even after a full day out it looked dewy but not greasy and sat beautifully on my face. I have 20+ foundations and would pick this on a hot day in a heart beat!! * I have combination skin & this broke me out. I am completely alletgic to it. Also the shades are much lighter in person. I bought a medium shade & even that is way too light for me. It's unusable for me but I'm sure it would work if you had normal skin. * Made my skin so oily. I didn't go outside all day and I looked like a greaseball. * Ive given this foundation so many tries but no matter how i prep my skin or apply this foundation it seperates within seconds of application. Really dissapointing."

I wear glasses and even in the 93¬∞ heat it barely came off of my nose. I've tried Milani, MAC, e.l.f., Fenty, and none of them were as transfer resistant as this. * I think that this is a really good product because you can build it to be a full coverage foundation or even sheer it out to just create a balance in your skin tone. I would also say that this product will not run out quick since I have had at least more than half of the bottle after using it for about nine months! my slight problem is the cap does get messy and it could be seen as just a bit expensive for being a drugstore brand * This was my go to for a while but now that that changed the formula it makes me look oily 2-3 hours in the day if not sooner in the day if its hot or humid even with grip/mattifying primer, powder and setting spray. Because of this, the foundation just slides off and starts breaking up. * this is my everyday foundation and i love the coverage and whatnot. not sweat resistant or waterproof (resistant) but it's a gem * I have only tried the old formula and its reallllly lightweight coverage is good however after 2~3 ours or even 1 hour after setting and baking i still get OILY supper quick im pretty sure this foundation would be better for normal to dry since it can hold my oily skin however i have faith and will retry with different powders as i have done before * This product made my pores more visible; and made my skin feel waxy. It was pretty expensive as far as my budget goes. * This has been my go to drug store foundation since it launched and I loved it immediately and as an added bonus it contained titanium dioxide and no pore cloggers. Unfortunately they reformulated the product without alerting consumers and I can absolutely tell the difference. They added chemical sunscreen which is trash and KNOWN pore clogging ingredients like denatured alcohol. This used to be an elite drugstore product in coverage, wear and longevity with only 1-1.5 pumps but now you're essentially getting a less than mediocre product for a disrespectful price as they did off course increase the price. I'm on the search for another product to replace this one unless they change the formula back to the original."

the old formula made my face look so smooth and I would always get complements on how beautiful my make up looked * I wore the old formula for YEARS AND YEARS religiously and was a huge fan, never a problem. this new formula is absolute trash and I am so sad I need to go on the hunt for a new brand. it seems they lost quite the following and I don't stand alone with my hatred for this new formula. it used to be a bit more liquid as opposed to the ""mousse"" texture and used to blend seamlessly, like it was my natural skin. this new formula feels SO greasy on, like it's just gonna transfer onto anything that might come in contact with your face and it's just sitting on your skin instead of blending in. it feels awful, within an hour or two I end up splotchy with some wearing off in certain spots and not others. I literally hate EVERYTHING about this new formula and I am mourning my old reliable go to foundation as I go on the hunt for something comparable to that * The new one is destroying my face! It causes severe breakouts, acne, and allergies. I hate it! I've been loyal to your brand for almost 10 years because of my sensitive and acne-prone skin and it worked perfectly, but now I got angry you juest ruin my skin. Keeping it pure and simple is your brand value, especially for those with problem skin, right? You have completely forgotten your original purpose and your primary target audience. We don't need a foundation to act as skincare. We just need it to be safe, simple, and pure. We don't need a foundation to double as skincare; we just need it to be safe, simple, and pure. Why try to make a foundation do skincare's job and end up making our skin worse? This is just a foundation; those additional functions aren't necessary. You could try them in another line or tinted moisturizer. This is incredibly disappointing. Bring back the old formula please! Your old formula is your golden formula, unless you want to damage your brand. * The moment I put this on my primed skin I knew it would be a disaster. As it's blending it becomes chalky, dry and extremely hard to use, even with a damp beauty blender. It sat on my face like a mask and felt itchy throughout the day. After a full day wear, I was left with chalky patches of foundation even after setting spray. This new formula is atrocious and should be avoided at all costs!!! * I used the barepro foundation for about 6 years and I loved it nothing could beat the old formula now it's changed and completely ruined this new formula is just awful it transfers off as soon as you apply it, it creases in the worst areas of the face, in the sun when you sweat you can forget you even applied any because it will literally melt off completely I don't understand how this company thought this was an improvement they had the best foundation for any type of skin now I'm desperately looking for a different brand. So disappointed. * Never thought there would be a replacement for EL Double Wear. This bare minerals foundation beats double wear by a long shot. It covers better with less product, stays on forever, does not crease, improves my skin, great color choice, easy to apply. And does not cause any issues with acne and I have oily acne prone skin - even being 60! I combine two shades for perfect match. * Changed the formula and it sucks so now i have to find a new foundation."
35,35,35,35,polite society,more than a pretty face skin-caring foundation,pimprod2040619,2615174," * It took some finagling, but I absolutely love this new formula. The first time I tried it, I used WAAAY too much. Only one pump is needed to adequately cover your whole face. I was pleasantly surprised to see that single pump lasted throughout the day without breaking down, and it only needed some minimal touch ups in my T-zone * This foundation is so pretty on the skin. It feels like your wearing nothing but yet gives a great coverage. I truly enjoyed using it till the pump broke after a couple times and it got pit to the sode cause i hate not being able to pump out or squeeze my product * LOVE this foundation but the pump is awful. * I've been looking for a foundation that works with my acne prone skin, and finding a shade match has been hard. This is one of the first foundations that works with my skin and made it glow. * I don't just throw the word holy grail around lightly!  This truly is THE BEST foundation I have ever tried and I've been searching for years.  If you are looking for a truly pale, neutral, full coverage formula with a natural finish and long wearing, this is the one!  I chose the very fair neutral shade.  At first swatch, I thought it was too light, but once it dries down it is the perfect neutral, buttermilk biscuit shade for this pale girl!  For reference, it is neutral but darker than Too Faced Snow and lighter than Swan.  In Nars, it is neutral and in between Siberia and Oslo.  Its closest match is L'oreal's 24 Hour Freshwear in shade 395 Rose Pearl, very, very close, but a much better more natural coverage.  I have mature, pale skin with pores on my nose, chin and cheeks that you can drive a truck through, but this covers them beautifully and blurs them out like magic.  I did prime my skin, ironically with NYX Liquid Putty Primer and even though this is a water based foundation, there was no separation or clashing.  With one pump worked into my foundation brush, it glided on and covered all my redness and sunspots, but looked like smooth skin and lasted all day.  I do powder with Dermablend loose setting powder and did touch up on my chin, nose and forehead with residual once during the day, but other than that, it remained perfect!  I am so impressed!! * Love this foundation on my mature skin. Hate the packaging. The pump initially dispensed too much product, then clogged, dispensing no product. Bottle shape takes up a lot of room when traveling. Would be 5 star product if packaging changed. * Recently I went into Ulta to look for a new darker foundation for the summer. I was going to stick to what I had been using previously but saw the Polite Society Foundation on the display next to me. I'm obsessed with ""good-for-you-skin-caring-foundations"" and tried on a couple of shades in store. I finally settled on Light Neutral. For the past few days I've worn this foundation religiously! I only wear foundation occasionally because my skin usually gets irritated with everyday wear, but daily wear of this foundation has actually made my skin look better! I've changed nothing in my daily and nightly skincare routine that would aid in diminishing my acne, redness, and pores. It's led me to believe  that this foundation has actually been helping my skin! What makes it even better is it feels so lightweight going on, but provides so much coverage. I can't stand wearing foundations in the summer that feel heavy and greasy on the skin. I've worn this for 14+ hours and it still looks just as gorgeous as when I first applied it. I also did an ingredient search on all the individual ingredients to make sure the ""clean"" claims were true, and this foundation doesn't contain any overly irritating or dangerous/toxic ingredients like some other popular foundations. If you're looking for an all-around gorgeous, safe, and long lasting foundation, this is the one!"

I was a bit reluctant after reading reviews, however, decided to give it a go! Its weightless, buildable and looks flawless. * This foundation does not exceed 30 minutes max! Even with primer, powder and setting spray. If you sweat even a tad with this foundation on all of it, and any product on top will melt off. Foundation is also super hard to blur and make look smooth. * I used different primers silicone and water based and it stull seperated byt noon * I really like this foundation. Was uncertain at first because of my VERY sensitive skin but have had no problems at all. Love that it contains sunblock so eliminates that extra routine (and layer!) from my routine. Love the slightly matte finish that doesn't appear unnatural. I'm not totally in love with the color match but can work around that with additional blush. Most all shades of Clinique seem to lean warm and ""cool"" shades look a very weird green on me but the formula is worth the effort. Can't imagine changing foundations anytime soon! * (sensitive/normal to dry skin)

This foundation is the one I keep reaching for! I use 1 pump to cover my full face and it will give me a medium coverage. If I'm going for a full coverage look for a night out I will use 2 pumps. Best of all this foundation matched me perfectly and did not oxidize. Feels light weight and lasts me ALL DAY, even in the TX heat. By the end of the night I will have a natural looking glow, not greasy looking my any means.  I have even worn it to the pool and it did not budge when my kids decided to splash me. 

Proper skin prep is a must! I've tested it out in 2 ways: a day of doing my normal skin prep & a day of no skin prep just foundation. (neither day did I use primer) 

The day with my normal skin prep routine (wash, toner, serums, moisturizer, spf) my skin looked flawless and lasted all day.

Foundation only (no skin prep): the foundation settled into my fine lines, & pores. * Love this foundation! The coverage is very full for a serum foundation. A little goes a long way and half a pump covers my entire face. It covers breakouts, discoloration, and acne scars beautifully. The shade CN20 Fair is a great match for my light skin with cool undertones. I have oily combination, sensitive, acne-prone skin and this lasts all day without causing breakouts. Highly recommend!! * This make up has a nice finish to it. Being an ""older"" lady (60+), it's hard to find a makeup that offers coverage and doesn't crease in every line. After the nice lady showed me how to apply it with a brush, it covers better than my makeup sponge alone."
39,39,39,39,natasha denona,hy-glam powder foundation,pimprod2044289,2624364," * I  asked an Ulta sales woman to help me cover  my red peeling skin 7 days after a microneedling  appointment. She used an IT makeup brush and miraculously this  glam facial foundation completely beautifully professional coverage.
This foundation is light, and doesn't feel like I had a makeup on. This was surprisingly as I have dry skin.
Expensive, but well worth buying. * I have never really used powdered foundation until finding out about Natasha Denona's. As a fan of her eyeshadow, concealer, blush and eyeliners... I was amazed! 

It gives a nice natural coverage that is somewhat luminous. I will say, if you have enlarged pores or fine lines, you may have to find yourself reapplying to those areas. It did not accentuate your pores, but if you struggle with that area I would recommend a primer, as it didn't cover them up completely. It is great for covering redness, dullness and uneven skin tone! 

Personally after a 12 hour night shift of wearing this foundation, I would say it transferred minimally without a primer or setting powder. I used the elf power grip setting spray, and it helped seal the foundation better. 
It's super easy to blend contour, blush, bronzer and highlighter on top of this! 

I would give this a 94% satisfaction rate and recommend it to those with more normal, sensitive, combo or even oily skin types. * A saleswoman at Ulta  in Wellington,Fl highly recommended this foundation  as  was shedding due to day 4 of my microneedling  facial.
I was skeptical as my skin is dry , but this was used as a setting powder on top of IT Cosmetics CC cream tint. I have Melasma and was amazed as how well this gave me a flawless radiant perfect  look. * I need full coverage due to melasma on my cheeks. This powder foundation is not enough to cover alone, HOWEVER if I go in and spot conceal with my concealer first, (under eyes and on melasma) and then put on the Hy Glam Foundation Powder (I do not use it under my eyes) the overall look is beautiful and light weight.  Since my skin is more on the dryer side I do make sure to prep my skin first with skincare. I use a dry beauty oil as my primer. I get a natural matte look when first applied and throughout the day my natural oils peak out yes, but in a good way.  This is the best powder foundation I have ever used on my skin, and at 57 I stay away from powder usually; however I was drawn to this one. I'm so glad I gave it a chance. This is my first powder foundation since 2013 roughly.   I just bought 2 refills of this powder! * If you have dry, mature skin, definitely a no. I wanted to enjoy this as I love her eyeshadows. I was very disappointed, it felt so drying on my skin. The best powder foundation I have found for dry mature skin is wander beauty foundation, a definite repurchase for a powder foundation üíØ * This really surprised me. I don't use the sponge, but I do use a slightly dense foundation brush and it just applies like butter. I have severely dry skin but can wear this with little prep and it looks natural and radiant. It pairs wonderfully with the concealer (another of my favorites) and I can't stop wearing it. Get it!! Don't be afraid of powder foundation! * Looks amazing both alone and on top of foundation. If you're looking for a good pressed powder this is it!!! Never settles and looks fresh all day."

It's lightweight, natural-looking and feels very high quality. It's pricey for a drugstore foundation, but it's definitely worth it in my opinion. * I seriously LOVE this skin tint. I have very dry flaky skin and one of the only foundations that doesn't look cakey on me and the price point is worth what you get! It does have light coverage but still enough to even skin tone. Still looks like your skin but better! If you want light weight, hydrating, light glow then this is for you! It doesn't emphasize pores too much even with a glowier finish. I feel like it lasts well enough throughout the day and if it does fade at all, it looks natural.  Really the only negative is the dropper packaging is messy so you can waste product if you're not careful. I make sure I have it standing up right which does help minimize the mess. The packaging isn't a big enough deal breaker though with how AMAZING the product wears on my skin. I love it so much! * I never thought I could be a tinted serum girl before trying this - really awesome coverage, you can tone it up or down. Stays on my skin and great for the summer. * I have tried so many serums and skin tints, at all price points, and this one is absolutely beautiful!  It has great coverage, feels like skin and lasts all day long. It dries down really well and you can easily layer other products over top of it without issue. Some people don't like the dropper and yes it can get messy, but its not a big deal and doesn't impact how the serum performs. * I love this skin tint so much. Very buildable and comfortable ! So pretty and natural !! * This is a beautiful lightweight serum foundation. It really does look and feel like skin.  I'm 55 years old with combination skin and it does not dry my skin out. I have to powder the t zone. otherwise it's a little too luminous, but I have to do that with every foundation I've tried. It wears beautifully and feels lovely on my skin - so much so that I feel sad removing it before bed. Took away one star because the shade range is lacking, unlike the name implies I could not find my tru match and will have to mix 2-3 Light and .5-2 Very Light which nulls the cost effectiveness of the product. I agree with other reviewers that the applicator is a hot mess and should be upgraded to a pump. Aside from these hiccups, it's a stunning formula and I enjoy wearing it."

Especially to get your right color. * Yall I have never used a foundation that feels like this, its a liquid but feels powdery!?! Anyway I LOVE IT!

Usually by the first 20 minutes i have some settling into my smile lines and this did not do that! Now i will say i dont use a setting powder unless im doing full glam! This probably isn't going to be your go to for full glam but for everyday I think it's perfect! If you have super dry skin i would probably steer clear of this as i feel with the powdery feel it would cling to any dry patches. For me personally this will be an everyday foundation! I hope this review helped anyone interested in this foundation! * I normally buy Beautycounter and grabbed this because Beautycounter is shut down.  This product is chalky and does not blend well.  It shows any and all peach fuzz on your face.  I used the color match feature on Ulta'a website to match the usual color I get from Beautycounter, and it's not even close to a match.  Look elsewhere.  This one isn't worth the money. * After trying a ton of different highly rated products only to gave clogged pores and breakouts, I finally found THE one. This feels so light on my skin, yet offers full, even coverage. It is also non-comedogenic and I havent had a single breakout. * Ultimately returning this for a few reasons; 1. caused breakouts. I tried to reintroduce this to my skin a few times, and each time resulted in new spots. 2. this separated quite a bit after a few hours of wear. No matter how I prepped or set this, it ended a bit patchy and settled into fine lines. 3. I tried applying this a few different ways (brush, hands, beauty blender) and each way took longer than I'd prefer to achieve a smooth application, but this could have just been my skin. * I have used Laura maercier for a years!! I was nervous when they changed their formula. And i was right to be! The new formula doesnt apply well, it seperates from my skin ( this is woth prep).
So sad bc it used to be my go to foundation"
46,46,46,46,it cosmetics,mini cc+ cream with spf 50+,pimprod2013015,2278481," * Idk what is issue, but I have CC+ in a shade ""Light"" that was too dark for me, so I ordered ""Fair light"" hoping I will mix it and get shade I need, but this Fair  Light  is darker than my ""Light"" shade üòÜ i am confused. honestly, comparing to the shade pictures, my shade I got ""Fair Light"" is similar to ""Neutral medium"". I really like this CC, but shades are too confusing. * IT are wonderful products. * I have been using this for several years and absolutely love it. I have another foundation for when I want to look extra put together, but for a regular day, this has great coverage and is a huge time saver since I don't need to apply moisturizer or concealer first, not to mention the SPF 50. Makes it a great all-in-one for travel!

I think the shade descriptions are a little off: I am fair with cool undertones and tend to opt for neutrals to warm me up, especially in summer. I have been wearing Fair (the lightest shade available at the time), even though it supposedly has warm yellow undertones‚ÄîI found it to be slightly warm at first, but I think my cool powder neutralizes it? Tried Fair Light once since it's supposed to be cool/rosy, but it was way darker and not a good match at all! I would go test shades before purchasing.

To those complaining that it doesn't stay in place, try it on a bare face (no serums and whatnot!) immediately after washing face, before it starts to feel dry, and always set with POWDER before adding any kind of setting spray, if you're into those. SETTING SPRAY ALONE DOES NOT SET CREAM/LIQUID FOUNDATIONS! You need the dry to set the wet. * My skin is aging and now I have some fine lines and age spots. I wanted to try a better brand of foundation to help minimize these annoying features. I have the IT concealer and love it, so I thought foundation would be perfect. I loved the way it went on. It was very smooth and good coverage (with the concealer).  The color match was perfect. I ran a few errands and got to my nail appointment and the first thing my nail tech said was, ""Oh honey, what is wrong with your face?"" She handed me a mirror and I was mortified. My skin looked blotchy, scaley, and dry. It had settled into my pores and lines and I could see where it had ran/smudged. It was a complete mess‚Ä¶super embarrassing. I didn't even know foundation could do that. I have never returned foundation before, but for the price of almost $50, I had to. * Great for aging skin * I love this CC cream. It's not full coverage tho, I dont know why people say thay or maybe I'm using way less than usual but that's how I like it. And I love that it has SPF which makes it even better. I have sensitive skin and this hasn't given me any issues. I've been using it for a year now and I'm planning to repurchase once I'm out. * love this product - doesn't crease and perfect for aging skin"

My only problem I had was that it looked a bit orange but once I put it on and spread it out it was perfect. Really good for the no makeup makeup look that's popular currently and for a quick everyday style. * I really wanted to love this! I pretty much onlt wear skin tints and ive tried quite a few. This one would have been great for me.. but if you sweat or live in a rainy climate DO NOT BUY! It literally melted off my face any time I got rained on or sweat. Full lunes of makeup running down mt face. * I've tried a couple drug store tinted moisturizers in the past that just didn't work and I never understood the hype. But now I get it. It provides just a little bit of coverage and evens out my skin tone but it looks and feels like you're not wearing anything. It's made me so much more confident because I'm not worrying if my foundation is cakey or smudged. * I absolutely love this, and it's not too little or too much. Just right.  And the glow is amazing. 10/10 * Nice light formula with just the right amount of coverage. I would have liked a wider range of colors. * I bought this thinking it was very lighthweight and it definitely feels that way but offers more coverage than I expected which is not a bad thing, considering it doesnt feel like I'm wearing anything heavier than sunscreen. A lot of product for the price too, considering the brand * The texture of this is so creamy and smooth. Leaves my skin nice and dewy."

It works well with combination skin, which thats what i have. Its super hydrating and coverage is great. * nice match * Bought this when it came out, hesitant at first because im an dehydrated and oily skin person. Figured out how to work with it and love it now. Perfect for a quick daily routine thats hasstle free because of the lighter coverage. Its definitely a light buildable coverage, but make sure your skin is prepped correctly. I set it with whatever powder I have on hand and its perfect.  

Waring that it can oxidize slightly, but its very similar to SFF by MAC. I use an NC 15 in both, but this one just sets a little darker. * I may be the only 30 something year old thats never worn MAC makeup‚Ä¶ BUT I wish I had a lot sooner than now. This makeup lasted through a 100+ degree day in Nevada and I just got home, its still on and looks great. Im a MAC believer. It did crease on my eyelids but eh whatever. It blends well on my combination skin (I used the 101 BK beauty brush to apply). I would recommend this to everyone, from acne prone skin to mature skin and everywhere between. Give it a try * I can see why people with normal to oil skin wouldn't like this, but I have have extremely dry, flaky, sensitive, acne prone skin and this looks amazing on me. Every other ""hydrating"" foundation I've tried doesn't last. by the end of the day, my skin looks dull and dehydrated while clingy onto all my dry patch. But not this MAC Serum-Powered foundation.   This glides smoothly over my dry skin, and gives me a beautiful glow that last all day. Because my skin is so dry, it never looks dewy or shiny, so this works perfect for me. * Hydrating * As I got to my 40's the MAC mat foundation was not work anymore as it used to. This new one is very hydrataiting and luminous. The only down is it gets a bit longer to dry out."

This is so ligtweight, easy to layer on, and great for oily skin! Choosing a shade is also pretty easy. This foundation does not oxidize or change in color  like other foundations I have used. The only con I have is the price tag, but it's worth it! * I absolutely love this foundation. I had been looking for a foundation for years that would compare to the urban decay naked formula from 2014. I honestly hated the heavy foundation trend and like foundations that dont feel heavy on the skin. This foundation looks and feels like skin. Its buildable and if you know how to prep your skin correctly lasts all day. Its the same price point as other high end foundations. This is definitely the makeup worlds best kept secret. * My specialist picked out the perfect color match in this make up does not make me feel or look cakey. Sometimes the price is worth the quality of the product. I'm so happy that I found this. It's completely changed the way my make up looks throughout the whole entire day. * I went into my local Ulta to pick up my usual Estee Lauder foundation but they were out of my shade. The Ulta employee i was working with recommended and shade matched me to Le Tint. WOW I finally wore it this weekend as its my ""fancy event"" foundation and the coverage is amazing, its long staying, didn't get greasy or seperate from my skin. As someone with a lot of acne scars this truly hid my scars and made my complexion look beautiful. 10/10 recommend * Not full coverage unless you literally cake this on.   I've tried a brush, sponge, fingers nothing works.   The finish is tacky it shows all pores and lines and does not stay on.    I wish I'd never bought it."

My skin looks incredible with it on and it applies so nicely, very light but great coverage! I dont even wear concealer with it! I put on a light moisturizer (I use Caudalie vinoperfect) and then apply the foundation with a brush. 5 stars!!! * This may be the worst foundation I've ever tried; I could not get this to apply correctly-i tried a brush, sponge and my fingers-there was just no applying this stuff. It was somewhat watery but I could not get it to spread on my face-i don't think I've ever had that happen with a foundation.  I wish I could give it 0 stars. * Looks very nice on * The best! * buildable and doesnt oxidize, it sits on the skin rly nice but tbh nothing too special i feel like you can find the similar product for cheaper * love love love bobbi brown products! makeup is supposed to enhance your features, not hide them. this foundation is super lightweight & leaves a smooth, natural look ..I'm at work for 9 hours daily, this holds up without creasing. if you are trying to hide acne I wouldn't recommend but fine lines/ pores/ uneven skin tone..this stuff is amazing & a tiny bit goes a long way"

Both work beautifully. * I'm light-medium with cool undertones. I purchased this stick in 220 C Buff. My complexion looked dirty when wearing this. I went back and purchased a light neutral shade. It was a better shade match, but both sticks looked like I was wearing a heavy foundation. I went light handed when applying but that didn't work. I'll stick with L'Oreal's Age Perfect tinted balm. Age Perfect glides over my dry, mature skin leaving a healthy ""looks like your skin but better"". * I find it super frustrating that most make up companies focus on making foundation for the younger crowd and have no clue what maturing skin is - and we will all get it eventually. I have nice skin. A bit red. Dry. Some lines are showing. I'm 52. I don't look my age. However trying to find one single foundation that evens out skin, doesn't harm it, doesn't cake up, doesn't transfer to every piece of clothing, doesn't turn orange in an hour, and you can actually wash it off at the end of the day - is nearly impossible. This foundation stick is good - it makes my redness disapear. It isn't too hard to wash off at the end of the day. No smell. But when it comes to color choice - terrible and more terrible. Lancome what is wrong with you? Expand the line up of colors! And like others have said - they don't match up with your other products. And it's a ""dry"" make up. Which I guess is okay but it feels somewhere in between a liquid and a powder. Not great for older skin. It also doesn't last long - meaning if you fully use it on your face every day, the stick goes down fast. I feel is isn't worth the money. * I love this makeup.  I am going thru chemo right now and my skin is pretty sensitive to alot of products.  Due to chemo I've been noticing dark spots on my face.  Not only does this cover my dark spots but it truly makes my skin amazing and even toned and doesn't feel like I'm wearing alot of makeup.  I just love it.  You don't need alot.  I just dab and blend.  It lasts all day and comes off easy when i was my face.  Highly recommend. * This is my first time buying this makeup. It matched my skin perfectly. Great coverage. My skin is dry and this did not make any lines or wrinkles stand out. Very moisturizing makeup. Friends noticed. Will definitely buy again! * One of the best foundations I've ever used. Great coverage and color! But if you plan to use on your whole face, there's very little product in the stick. Used up the entire stick in only a few weeks. * I do love this stick. I wish they made more shades though. The one I have is good, but I would like it to be lighter. The makeup stays on for me, and it's so convenient. I can just put the foundation where I need it and go. It's moisturizing and lasts a long time."
55,55,55,55,lanc√É¬¥me,teint idole ultra wear care and glow foundation,pimprod2033657,2598637," * Ulta is never in stock with lancome foundations and especially on the shade 310 * For years I've trouble matching my skin tone and I finally found the foundation that matches perfectly! This is lightweight, but still gives good coverage. * Finally found my holy grail foundation, i love this so much!! I have acne prone skin and this covers well without feeling cakey. I hope they never stop making this because i will forever buy it < 3 * I have aggressively combo skin and big pores, I have tried Dior, CT, Haus Labs, etc. I genuinely thought my skin just could not handle foundation because it always looked cakey. This one never ever has. Looks good in every single lighting, photographs so well, shade match is insane, it lasts so long, and the coverage is beautiful (some comments say its light and that steered me away for a while but trust me it is not even when using beauty blender). Tip, use the saie glowy gel underneath. It fills in your pores and fine lines so the foundation sits on top and does not sink. I do notice that the foundation will settle into pores after a while, but never if I use saie before. I also set this foundation with huda powder. I wore this exact combo to graduation pics and everyone didnt believe me when I said I did my makeup myself. Unfortunately this is worth the money. * This foundation was really great when I first tried it on (apart from the scent) but I'm starting to notice some flaws. 

For starters, I have combo/sensitive skin. At first I felt like this gave a nice glowy finish but it seems to now not maintain that glow throughout the day. Buy the end of the day my skin feels tight and dry and is very patchy in some places. 

The fragrance of this is also horrible. Almost returned for that alone. This might be a good product for some people but just doesnt do it for me. * This foundation was not for my skin type but does have some positive attributes. First the negatives: I received a bottle very close to the expiration date. it has alcohol high in the ingredient list. I fail to see any glow on my dry skin. I would regard the finish as natural to semi matte. it also contains substantial fragrance. I would not recommend it for mature or sensitive skin. All that being said I think this could be a lovely foundation for a younger combo to oily skin.  it is not radiant by any means but does have a very subtle luminosity and is buildable and quite long wearing. but for dry sensitive skin it burns my skin a bit. It's not terribly comfortable. Not sure if it's the alcohol content or the fragrance but I'm guessing the alcohol because I feel tight and dry when I wear it. I don't love fragrance in foundation but usually tolerate it without a problem. I think this is a pretty foundation for the right skin type. But I also don't like receiving a product that will expire before I can possibly use it so please check your bottle. I also suggest choosing your shade in person rather than online as I found it difficult to get a good color match. * I absolutely LOVE this foundation.

I've used a bazillion‚Ä¶. Trying to save money.
Went back to Lanc√¥me‚Ä¶. This one.

I'm 57.

It gives enough coverage and covers well without making me look unrealistic or uncomfortable.

It is beautiful.

after my decade+ of always wishing I could find a good liquid foundation without silicones, that matched me, and performed!
this is it!! 
I really hope this never gets discontinued, it's so perfect. 
it really does last, and it smoothes my skin texture, whereas other foundations always emphasize dryness and lines.

It is very unusual to find a lower price point complexion product that looks beautiful and doesn't cause acne on my skin, but here it is.

CONS: Transfers easily. Settles into pores and lines. Needs touch up application every few hours. 

I wanted to love Charlotte Tilbury's Beautiful foundation, but it doesn't compare to my favorite Estee Lauder medium coverage non-transfer makeup. * There was a weird blue/gray streaks inside the container after a few months. I was scared that it was mold so i returned it. * The best foundation I have EVER used. * Got the lightest shade and it was still too orange. It highlights every single pore, wrinkle and clings to dry patches. Doesnt last at all- even with prepping my skin, primer and setting spray. Used a water based primer and concealer and it pilled so bad around my eyes. * very nice * Shows ever wrinkle and blotches to easily. I even used both silicone and water based primers and nothing holds this in place. Terrible and way over priced * Im getting close to 40 & have been struggling with finding makeup that doesnt age me (& covers my rosacea) i started using the magic cream moisturizer & fell in love so decided to try this & im equally as in love!! Its super lightweight but has GREAT coverage, especially for medium coverage. Ive been getting a lot of compliments on my skin too. Highly recommend!"
58,58,58,58,dior,dior forever foundation fluid matte,pimprod2036825,2604875," * Loved the foundation, doesn't feel like there's anything on your face. But the bottle is horrible. The nozzle dries out between uses, and the squirts everywhere. It got all over my sheets/bedding and does not come out. Permanently stained everything. * This foundation is now my holy grail! I have been trying to replave my uber expensive Tom Ford foundation for 6 years and ive finallyyyyyy found it! * Holy Cow!  It only took me 20 years to find this product!  But seriously, this foundation looks amazing!  I have very oily skin  (now with dry patches - thanks peri menopause), large pores and I'm 50yo.  My skin is in pretty good condition due to a lifetime of avoiding the sun.  But regardless foundation on me just looks frightful and frankly always has. In my youth I opted to use pressed powder foundations but as I approached my mid 40's, that started to look like trash on my skin too. I always use a primer for oily skin, currently that's MAC Studio Fix Mattifine 12hr Shine Control, and this foundation lays down beautifully over it!  Now, I will likely have to blot my face until the end of time and I'm used to (and resigned to) that fact.  But my foundation doesn't lift or separate or settle in fine line throughout the day.  It wears very gracefully, even with occasional blotting. No patchiness either!  It is sooo close to skin-like - I'm thrilled!   

Some things to note:   This does have fragrance. I'm pretty sensitive but I find the frag to be subtle and it immediately dissipates.  Also, this does contain denatured alcohol which is a solvent and a known skin irritant.  Normally I avoid skin products with these ingredients....but I'm taking this on the chin (haha!) for now.
Application: I use 1 pump and apply with a damp Real Techniques sponge and that gives me the light coverage I prefer.  I powder with either Uoma translucent or Urban Decay Velvetizer (yes I horded some before it was discontinued).  This cancels my redness very well and reasonably controls my (excessive and unavoidable) shine. * Decided to give this a try after I didn't see Too Faced Born This Way Matte online anymore. Its gorgeous! Will definitely be my go to foundation now. * The pump dispenser constantly clogs, projectiling foundation everywhere.  It's stained my clothing, my rug and anything in a 2 foot radius. At this price point, they should've hired a better engineer. Coverage is mediocre as well. Should've returned * I currently use this in 0CR, which looks slightly pinkish in the picture on the website, but does not look that way coming out the pump at all, and looks yellow on my skin! just beware that this oxidizes :/ * I have an uneven skin tone. I also never had any great foundation that would hide the dark spots around my eyes. I wasn't hoping for much when I purchased this. But once I got it, I fell in love. Everything about it is just amazing. It has a light perfume smell to it. OMG. It hides everything I need it to hide and the shade is just perfectly matches my neck. I'm eternally in love. Sticking with Dior from now on. About matte part, it is matte. It doesn't have that glow that some people would prefer."

It matched great but oddly sits on top of my skin * I wanted to love this product so much, but it's not great at all. I have to say, it was the oerfect color match for my skin color; First of all, for the price I was expecting much more product. Second, although it glides on very nicely it does not look  like it attaches to my skin whatsoever. The foundation looks like a film on top of my skin. I tried applying it with a brush and with a sponge; it looked the same both ways. Third, it looked streaky. Overall, I'm very disappointed with this product. * S√∫per light, loved the product affordable * I'm usually a cool to cool beige & this was a perfect match at #2 neutral.

63,63,63,63,hourglass,veil hydrating skin tint,pimprod2040571,2611435," * I absolutely love this skin tint. I have normal, sensitive skin, but can be dry sometimes. I've never used foundation before, since my skin is extremely sensitive. I've been looking for a hydrating but lightweight skin tint/tinted moisturizer for quite a while. This is perfect! It has a beautiful, glowy finish, and it doesn't irritate my skin. If you're looking for something that's full coverage this definitely isn't for you. It covers my acne scars beautifully, but doesn't hide my freckles. (Which I love). I wouldn't recommend blending this with a sponge, I would use your fingers or a brush. My blush and highlighter goes on smoothly on top of this. It's definitely pricey but worth it in my opinion. I just wish there was SPF added, but I can get past that with how amazing this product is. * I have no idea how this product receives such rave reviews. It's a moisturizer, and provides zero coverage. It's not makeup. I visited an Ulta store, where I told them what my goals are (light-medium coverage, natural look, friendly to my aging millennial skin, buildable coverage when necessary, etc). Kudos to the associate - They did color match me exactly. However, after using this product myself at home, it literally does nothing. I even purchased the Hourglass setting powder to finish off the look, to no avail. And not only that! I used my usual makeup routine over top (eyelid primer, eyeshadow, eyeliner), and this Skin Tint is so ""moisturizing"" that even with my tried-and-true eyelid primer, my eyeshadow and eyeliner were all but gone by the end of the work day. I also had to use A LOT of this product to achieve even just the slightest bit of coverage. When I use my tried-and-true BB cream, I use mayyyybe a few little dabs to get the coverage I'm looking for. Needless to say, this will be going back to the store. No idea how this product made it through the testing phase and onto store shelves. It needs to be rebranded as a moisturizer, because it's definitely not makeup. * I am sort of not sure about this product. I am an Hourglass stan but i don't think this is really anything special‚Ä¶..Its expensive for what it is. * I like the light coverage obtained by this product.  Hardly know you are wearing anything but it has a nice finish * I have every kind of foundation made by man & I have been reaching for this daily especially since the weather has warmed up. It is dependable and works literally with any canvas you start with. It's even saved my base when another top leading one looked patchy & separated on my skin. I sprayed my face with Fix Plus & dabbed a little of this over my previous used foundation and it prevented me from taking it off & starting over.
Bottom line: this has been a very dependable foundation/skin tint in my collection & I will most def repurchase when I run out & would recommend others purchasing if you like light coverage and a lighter feeling base! * I love a light coverage dewy look, but this was almost nothing. And what was there settled right into my pores on my cheeks and was patchy in others. Will definitely be returning * I bought this after seeing it was part of Sophia Richie's make up routine. I tried it once and my skin broke out so i didnt use it for 4 months and recently tried it again and i got hives and huge pimples all over my face and i normally dont have pimples at all."
64,64,64,64,morphe,filter effect soft-focus foundation,pimprod2022516,2577758," * Beautiful blurred/filter effect. Medium 13 is my perfect shade match. Long lasting, even in my oily areas where foundation doesnt usually wear well. I have very oily skin and this is my top go to foundation but I wouldn't reccomend for dry skin types. This is a thicker formula so it can be more clingy to dry spots. * My budget got mega tight, so I was on the hunt for a good foundation. I was using Tarte, Clinqiue, etc. I honestly don't know why I bought it. I read the reviews and looked at before/after photos and decided to give it a whirl. I'm so glad I did!! For the price, you cannot beat it! It doesn't smell like cheap foundation. It's creamy and smooth. It seems to stay in place with a good primer (I also touch my face a lot during the day though). It doesn't break out my mid-40s face. It doesn't separate itself or get cake-y. I don't get oily. It's light weight. I'm just impressed!! I think this will be my go-to foundation now. I would go in a store and get matched to a foundation. What I thought I would be online was not what I ended up purchasing...I was slightly on the warmer and darker shade. * I've never used Morphe for foundation, I usually go with a different brand and after not finding my shade in that brand in store, decided to check our Morphe. I was able to color match myself, which I found this one to be a better match than the one i always use. I like how it looks on my skin, it's so light that it's not cakey, and my face doesn't feel heavy with product. * i love this foundation so much! Literlly my favorite. Morphe better keep this ugh A * Gtreat foundation * I didn't like it. It never stayed on my skin i loved when i put it on at first and then hours later it was cakey and patches of spots looked like it came off. Matte like finsh and very dry * For the price and the brand I thought it would be a decent foundation but I've paid less than 10 dollars for better foundations than this. I've gave it multiple tries but it just doesn't sit well on the skin and does not give a soft natural finish what's so ever. Do not buy!!"
65,65,65,65,urban decay,face bond self-setting waterproof foundation,pimprod2044818,2623593," * Okay, this foundation is next level if you have oily skin. I would classify my complexion as downright greasy with visible pores within 30 minutes of walking out the door. The color match was phenomenal with no mixing of colors required. I own about 8 foundations and only one is an OTC brand that I use to mix and match to match my complexion. An added plus is the packaging. Nothing is wasted and easily portable. I never would have expected Urban Decay to be THE ONE. * The foundation bottle color seemed different when I applied it , I wouldn't recommend. * I was hesitant to buy this reading the reviews but i am so glad i did!! It works great on my skin and i really love it. Urban decay foundations work well with my skin. Things work so differently on everyones skin so If you want to try i say go for it, if it doesnt work take it back. * I had high hopes for this product, as it advertises having a built in primer and being waterproof. It is extremely cakey and splotchy, especially if you have textured skin. The finish is bland and just unflattering. * I am so impressed with this foundation! I have a very oily T-zone & this doesn't separate on me like most do. I still powder in those areas with a loose powder & puff btw! I love that it's ""heavy duty"" while being medium coverage & lightweight! * I have combination skin m, mostly dry.  This foundation is full coverage and stays on really well. I was in active labor for about 12hrs and pushed out my baby and this foundation stayed on!  The nurse in my post partum room even asked if I did my makeup right after delivering üòÇ I live on Arizona it's very hot and dry.  If you have combination skin make sure you moisturize really good prior to applying this foundation * amazing, I hardly get oily during my work day. Have been using it daily now."
66,66,66,66,jane iredale,purepressed base mineral foundation refill,pimprod2033383,2595091," * This perfectly matches my skin tone. It's very difficult to see when I swab it on my face to see the color.  Nothing  else has ever matched like this. I have been using it for about 8 years. I have normal to dry skin and this gives a natural look. * Initially I didn't like this powder. Was accustomed to fuller coverage powder foundations and i think the shade i chose was a bit light. Decided to use it as a setting powder over a tinted moisturizer because i had a sample of a good tinted moisturizer i wanted to try. I really only wanted to use it up so my money wasn't wasted. This is where i fell in love. It's very good at blurring and I found that it was better than the 100 different setting powders I'd used. I'm a little surprised about the reviews that mentioned cracking because this is the ONLY powder I've ever had in 35 years (in my 50s) that i used completely. Even the little edges stayed in place until they were completely gone. Weird. I can only guess it's because i never bought the hard case to put it in because I initially didn't love it. It stayed in the plastic refill case until ENTIRELY gone. * It does not cover like I'd hoped. I do like the way it goes on with a brush and feels like nothing on my skin. I think the color match is good. But for the price I'm looking for something else that covers my red spots and little veins better. * I love this product. It doesnt break me out and it last all day but the product itself is not durable. Ive only had it for 2 months, hardly using it, and it cracked :( i even used the jane iredale compact made for the pressed powder and still cracked. I love it but the fact that it cracked is not making me want to continue to purchase this product * better than bare minerals * I wasnt sure what to expect with this, but im SOOOOO impressed!! The coverage is good with a few swipes of a brush, and it doesnt look like powder on the skin! I do make sure to prime first and also spray my face afterwards (I have only tried the pommist spray but plan to try other brands too). I got shade bisque which is my perfect match, i am fair with yellowish olive undertones. Oh i recommend trying their cream blush and highlight on after primer but BEFORE powder!!! Somehow, it works and looks so good. So happy I decided to try this brand. * I have combo/dry, acne-prone skin and have tried multiple high end and drug store foundations. This product is seriously AMAZING and gives me the perfect coverage for my blemishes and hyperpigmentation. I love that it's super easy to apply (I use a dry makeup sponge), doesn't dry out my skin, and doesn't cause breakouts. I will forever purchase this!!"
67,67,67,67,dior,dior forever fluid skin glow foundation,pimprod2036824,2605019," * Its patchy, it slides off my skin no matter what setting product i put over it. If you have any kind of lines on your forehead, around your nose, mouth its goong to soak in those lines. Just the worst foundation i have ever bought which is extremely disappointing given the price and brand. * This foundation is top tier. Originally I was a little concerned about the fragrance but its been a few months and I havent broken out (I have ezcema too). It gives the most natural glow but doesnt make you look oily. No one can ever tell I'm wearing foundation when I wear this. The foundation looks best if you exfoliate your skin and use toner + moisturizer. I usually apply with my hands or spatula. I usually blend it out with fingers and/or a beauty blender. * Very heavy did not like plus it has a rare smell * This foundation dries my skin like crazy. I tried twice, on the 1st day with my regular skincare, and felt very dry after a few hours. On the 2nd day, I added layers of moisturizer and had the same results, so I am disappointed and definitely returning it. * Didn't like it at all no coverage and super watery. * I am so beyond thrilled and impressed with this foundation. Honestly, I don't think I could ever go back to another formula! A little goes a long way ‚Äî you literally only need 2 small pumps of product to cover your entire face with a luminous, ethereal glow. It blends like a dream and feels like another layer of skin. Believe it or not, I get SO many compliments when I wear it. People tell me my skin looks amazing when I have it on. It gives me so much confidence and makes me feel beautiful. The shade-matcher worked perfectly. I didn't even have to try on this foundation before I ordered it and it was a PERFECT match.

Buy it, buy it, BUY IT!!!! * I love the coverage.  I am 58 years old. The foundation does not sit in the wrinkles. I find applying with a sponge helpful."
68,68,68,68,anastasia beverly hills,"medium coverage, natural finish luminous foundation",pimprod2008586,2551421," * I love the formula, but twice now I've had these foundations leak simply because the bottle fell over in a drawer. I don't know how you sell foundation for nearly $40 and justify such low quality packaging, but I guess ABH thinks thats good enough. * I've searched all over for a new foundation for my aging (44), sensitive skin. This is perfect! No harsh ingredients, beautiful color/finish, lightweight, and zero breakouts. I will definitely repurchase and highly recommend!! * I have been looking for a shade that comes close to my complexion. I have brown skin with golden undertones. This product is the closest match. The biggest problem is it does not set. DO NOT TOUCH YOUR FACE WHEN WEARING.  It slides off no matter what primer and setting spray you use. If you wear glasses, it wipes off. Don't smile, you'll have huge crease lines. I'm  not sure what the other reviewers are using, but for me, it's a huge no. I've been using foundations for approximately 12 years and other than the color match, this is The Worst! * I have used many foundations in my life. I have used many primers in my life. I have also used many different methods of application. This is hands down the worst foundation i have ever used. No combination will make it look decent. I dont have dry skin, and it manages to grab on to dry patches that dont exist. My pires look giant. No amount of setting piwder or spray can set this. It cales up and slides off in patches. Dont even think about touching your face. Or laughing. Or smiling. Or forrowing your brows. This is an absolutely awful product. * Medium  to full coverage no cakey at all, I will definitely will continue buying and maybe try other products from the brand, I've only know tyem for eyebrow products , totally worth the try * The foundation was really pretty but the aplicator was awful. It wasnt a pump it was just a stick and would spill easy. It also I guess would open on its own and spill every where. After the first time it spilled I made sure it was closed tight before puttinf it up but it spilled again. I will not be buying this again. * I have combo skin and some light acne. I also live in a high humidity, high heat area and this foundation, on my skin, works beautifully. The color match was perfect. I didn't experience any oxidation either. I sweat quite a bit, and with setting spray, this foundation doesn't budge. I really like it, and I highly recommend this and the concealer. Both products are 10/10 for me."
69,69,69,69,tarte,babassu foundcealer dewy foundation spf 20,pimprod2006408,2542892," * My all time favorite light-medium foundation. Matches my skin perfectly and looks very natural. Been using since it came out originally. LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Cant say enough about it. Holds up to heat and humidity and never settles into fine lines * Literally my everyday foundation bc of the  perfect color match and the dewyness üò©üò© * its impossible for me to find foundations that work with my really dry skin. I really liked the tarte brand for their shape tape concealers especially the dewey formula. So when I tried this out, I loved how it had a nice luminous glow and if I applied hydrating primer underneath it, I didnt have the same pilling and peeling that normally comes with most foundations. * The Best! Will buy over and over again!

This foundation is so natural looking and contains SPF. It's dewy and covers well. Helps you look flawless. * This is THE BEST foundation. I have received SO MANY compliments on it. It is full coverage but feels light on. Stays on well. HIGHLY recommended. * I don't wear a lot of makeup, since going to classes isn't the event of the year. But I needed a lightweight foundation that still covered acne for  when I have interviews. This foundation is light enough that I can't really notice it on my skin throughout the day but still stays on just fine. Not the most high coverage foundation in the world but goes on easily and covers up acne * Love it! Will purchase again"
70,70,70,70,tula,radiant skin brightening serum skin tint spf 30,pimprod2032850,2598954," * I have super sensitive skin ands combination/oily. I have been searching for the perfect skin tint and i think i might have found it. It has a little of all the makeup worlds. You got the lightweight feel, sunscreen, and just a hint of color. Not to mention, it does all kinds of good things for your skin. The trick to making it perfect for your skin is to try it out in different ways. I have used primer underneath it and extra spf. I have used it without . I have found out with this , less is definitely more. Or at least for my skin it is. Its worth a shot . * Absolutely love this chemical SPF tinted moisturizer. Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin as some other chemical sunscreens do. Coverage is light/medium, shade choices excellent (I'm quite cool and fair and have a terrible time with this--I wear both 2 and 6 here, depending on season). I have no problem with balling, settling in lines, etc. The biggest trick is to try different products (if any!) underneath it, less is more there in any case. I use BHA and AHA exfoliants evenings so dry patches aren't an issue either. As this is a chemical sunscreen, it should be the last skin-care layer, but below makeup (whereas physical sunscreens should be the last layer period). My (mature) skin look great with it on. * I had tried many tinted moisturizers before and they all broke my face out, were too oily or the colors never matched. 
I found this one and I love it. 
The color match is great. Its lightweight but still has a nice coverage with the tint. It makes your face glow and subtly hides imperfections. Plus it has SPF! * I play in a orchestra and its perfect for stage makeup, it also gives a my skin but better feel, underhyped product for sure, got rid of my redness in my face aswell from the serum * I really wanted to like this product but I just couldn't. I have combo skin, sometimes its on the oilier side and sometimes its dry. This product felt like it was sitting on my face the entire day and everytime I looked in the mirror it looked worse. It got super cakey. If I tried to blend out the cakiness it would just slide around like I was just applying it for the first time. I tried setting it and didnt see a huge difference. Will be returning. * I've been using Tula skin tint for over a year now and love it! It's a great clean option which is hard to find! The tint is enough to replace my foundation and it gives me a nice dewy glow. The tint blends well with your natural skin tone even if it's not a perfect match. My face is a lot lighter than my chest so I use a darker shade than my face  The consistency is thick but it blends nicely. Bonus SPF for sunny days * If you have any texture on your skin it can get a bit patchy and almost sticky. Trying to use a beauty blender seems to just absorb the product, and brushes just move it around. If I use my fingers it more sticks to my fingers than my face. Not for everyone."

She was very knowledgeable of Mac products. * Ive been wearing studio fix foundation for ahout 16 years. I recently went into mac to get more and found out they had a new formula?! Why?! There was nothing wrong with the original one. Please bring it back!

My skin looks so bad with this new ""matte"" foundation. It dries so quickly and doesnt blend. I hate it üò´ * The original was PERFECT!!! Why did mac have to ""fix"" something that didnt neef to be fixed!!! This is MATTE it is NO LONGER a natural finish it is SO UNFORTUNATE‚Ä¶.. so disappointed. Settled in fine lines and dried on my skin‚Ä¶ looked HEAVY and CAKEY after literally 2 hrs in a house with AC‚Ä¶. So terrible. So upset. The original was the only foundation that worked for me in this tx heat. * I have been using Mac since 2016. The studio fix fluid foundation has always made my skin flawless even when i've had my issues with hormonal acne. Since switching to the new formula my skin has been so dry, and it looks and feels terrible. Could it be the only cause, maybe, but my skin has not been the same since switching. So upset‚Ä¶ * I wear NC10 and I really like the change in color from the old to the new formula. The new NC10 is just a bit less yellow and more neutral. However, the lasting powrr and coverage are terrible now. I wish they would bring back the old formula. Will not be repurchasing and would not recommend unless youre only wearing for a couple of hours or have flawless skin. * I hate hate hate this new formula, the old formula was the best and i feel like my shade isnt my shade anymore * I have been purchasing Studio Fix for 10 years religiously and this new formula is NOT ""new and improved"" for my skin, at least. There most definitely IS a difference and I am returning it today. I gave it a fair chance and it slides off my face. So disappointed. Feels more like a serum which is not what I want in this particular product. I need to find a new liquid foundation and go through a bunch of trial and error."
72,72,72,72,l'or√É¬©al,infallible 24h fresh wear foundation in a powder,pimprod2021871,2575170," * Never looks cakey, the shade range is great, doesnt make my dry skin look dry, perfect coverage * It's such a bad product. I have oily skin. First of all, it doesn't blend. I tried it with a brush, I tried it with a pad, sponge It doesn't stay on my face, It gives a cakey look * I have gone through few of these bc I like the finish it gives but I can never end up finishing the entire product without the products breaking in to a million pieces and spilling everywhere. Even if I am extremely careful with it the product cracks and then crumbles. I even tried to repair the product and it was a solid piece for maybe 2 days before it cracked again. * This powder is the only makeup product that lasts on my skin without making me look cakey. I use it under my eyes and it covers my dark circles. The coverage surprised me. It lasts all day, even when I get sweaty. All you have to do is swipe the product with the sponge then swipe your face. * Great coverage, stayed matte the whole day, color matched my skin perfectly, great value. However, contains talc; and I can't continue using it CONFIDENTLY knowing the possible dangers of talc. * Good coverage, good skin tone match * This is an amazing powder. Very smooth very blurring. Makes  your skin appears soft. It is comparable to the MAC powder, but I do feel the MAC powder is slightly better just SLIGHTLY. But I would still buy this powder instead becauseof the price difference. If you're double guessing yourself then stop and go get it."
73,73,73,73,chanel,les beiges water-fresh tint,pimprod2030055,2574253," * I recommend this makeup base, since the look it gives to your skin is natural, healthy and gives a glow. If you are looking for a makeup with hydration and duration, this is the right one. Its price is high, but it is totally worth it. * Il've had the product for a week and i don't think it keeps my face moist like other Chanel products. My creases and  start to show and my skin starts to feel dry. Hard to get an even feel. * But this was the first tint that gave me shfficient coverage and it GLIDED on my dry skin and over my fine lines, especially under my eyes, with ease. Even some of the hydrating K-Beauty cushions I've tried accentuated my dry spots and fine lines. Please do not change the formulation, Chanel, it's perfect. * This is my new favorite product and worth every penny! * I love it,my skin feel so hydrated,so soft and shine.Is my second bottle that i'm buying and i will never changed it. * This product is cute. Upon first impression, i ordered the lightest shade and it was so much darker in the bottle which startled me since i'm so fair. I applied it and the shade matched very well (thankfully i didn't waste money). I tried applying it with the brush at first but the application was streaky so i just used my fingers. It gives a very beautiful finish and blends seamlessly but it will slightly emphasize some dryness on my forehead if i'm not careful. I'd definitely recommend if you'd like to splurge and try something innovative and cool. * This was a splurge purchase and I'm so glad that I bought it. It's very sheer with just light tint, but it's very moisturizing and gives your skin a beautiful, healthy glow. I do use the brush that it came with and it looks so pretty. My face doesn't feel oily or like it just sits on top of my skin. I'm not sure that I will repurchase since there are several dupes for significantly less, but I am glad that I tried it."
74,74,74,74,clinique,even better refresh hydrating and repairing makeup foundation,pimprod2004194,2541677," * I have used Clinique make-up and skin care for a long time. This is the worst foundation I've ever used. It made my skin look 10 years older and settled majorly into fine lines.  I seriously looked like a clown! I'm going back to the old Even Better broad spectrum spf15. * This is too drying and chalky.    Bring back Even Better Glow! * I Love tbis foundation a lot I got it because it's dermatologist test and will work well with my rosacea. It covered pretty well I just had to spot tiny spots with concealer. It gives of a nice clean natural look. It's very easy to blend in with. I will definitely repurchase this. * I read a lot of the reviews before trying. Honestly do not understand the negative reviews. I am 44 and have quite a few fine and deep lines. this foundation blends well and has great coverage without settling into any lines. Almost has a plumping effect. The coverage is amazing. it covers aging spots and other blemishes. It is long lasting. I highly recommend. * when I first applied it it was fine! but I only had it for about 3-4 months and after a month, it started oxidizing and is super patchy when I apply it.... * Great product for users with drier or more mature skin. I used it for the first time at my son's wedding.  The next day, my sisters and friends complimented me on my complexion and asked what I did differently. Will buy again * I like this product because it makes my skin look stunning."

I have used many products, high end to drug store and this is the best for me hamds down. A little goes a long way and feels and looks like skin. I am 64 and it doesn't settle into fine lines. * this make up is great, i have med/dark skin, nc45 and i can wear tan 66, great make up. nice and creamy def full coverage-will buy again!! * This is my favorite! Lightweight but full coverage and 60 is an amazing shade. It doesnt last as long as some other foundations, but its so good I don't care. * The foundation is wonderful and have great coverage but definitely not for oily skin girlies would definitely love this in a matte style‚Ä¶..but it's light weight I would just recommend having a powder touch up if u have oily skin * Very glad I was able to exchange for this darker foundation. The workers were very polite and patient with the transaction. * I was so surprised by this! I have oily skin but I hate how foundations for oily skin are all matte so I tried this one out and it's the perfect amount of glow and coverage. I applied it at 6am and it was still perfect at 6pm * Wanted to love it - I usually love Kat's products, but this foundation is terrible. It looks and feels amazing immediately after application. But this is incredibly short-lived. Within the hour my makeup was separating and leaving clumpy spots of foundation in between the obviously bare speckles across my whole face, while managing to accentuate every single pore or imperfection on my skin . Is smears and transfers with the lightest touch. No matter the use of powders and sprays to set it, it just sits right ""above"" your skin and takes almost nothing to just start falling apart."
76,76,76,76,chanel,les beiges healthy glow foundation hydration and longwear,pimprod2030080,2571508," * This is so worth the money. I've always used Mac since I ever started using makeup but wanted something a little lighter for everyday now in the corporate world but good quality. Now that i'm 29 I'm happy to splurge for quality especially if i'm giving a 16hr days a week. This is worth every penny for newly growing mature skin. * This is the prettiest foundation I've ever put on! It is very natural looking, glowy, and breathable. It doesnt change colors or cake the longer you wear it. It looks the same all night and wears comfortably. It gives light to medium coverage which is my preference in a foundation. Also, although the price tag is steep, I am able to do my full face with a small dot on my beauty blender so I am hopeful that I will be able to make a single bottle last for a while! * First of all, I never write reviews because I am never ""wow'd"" by anything. However, I recently have been trying out so many different foundations, attempting to get the perfect everyday foundation as well as something to wear for my upcoming bridal and wedding events. This foundation is absolutely amazing. It looks like skin and is beyond easy to blend out-barely takes any effort. I got a sample from the ULTA store and am planning on buying the full size. Obsessed! * I have not really loved a Chanel foundation since the original Vitalumiere which I loved. But first they discontinued my shade and then the product itself and I never found anything that compared. I have always struggled with shades in Chanel and they do tend to very greatly from one formula to another. I do not like matte foundation but I also don't prefer something that looks wet or greasy. This product is a great balance. It looks fresh with a lit from within glow. It is comfortable and also quite long wearing. The coverage is light but buildable which is my preference and I was able to get a pretty good shade match. It does have fragrance but it is not overwhelming. I own many high end foundations and skin tints and this has quickly become a favorite. I find myself reaching for it a lot. It just makes my skin look good. I am almost 68 years old so that is saying something. It looks very natural. My skin is very dry but I think this foundation could be used for most skin types and all ages. It's very versatile. * Love this foundation so much. I have pretty dry, flakey skin. This is hydrating and looks very natural. As much as I'd love to repurchase, I can't because of the price point. * This particular product looks natural on the face and is hydrating. It has a perfume scent which I love. I would recommend it if you want a natural glow look. Perfect for summer. Not cakey but covers great. * foundation is good for dry skin with some lines and discoloration -it is thin so I apply a couple of layers"

I love the flawless, light coverage. It's perfect for those no makeup makeup days! I am a mom, so some days I don't have a lot of time to get ready and this gives me that sense of security. I'm definitely impressed with this foundation. The price can be a little bit hefty, but that's what comes with a luxury product! All in all, I will keep this on hand and repurchase as I run out ! * I love the way this foundation looks on my skin. The coverage is light to medium. It blends beautifully, lasts all day and I love it. I would recommend this to everyone. * Seriously, I have tried nearly 30 brands and this is light and covers so beautiful. It has SPF and makes my skin look so healthy and glowy. I am in my 40s and still have oily skin and some dry patches of skin. It doesn't sit on top, it really looks like fresh gorgeous skin. * Great natural finish. Makes your skin feel super soft and flawless. 10/10 recommend * great product nice coverage"
83,83,83,83,smashbox,halo healthy glow tinted moisturizer broad spectrum spf 25,pimprod2016307,2568499," * I love halo I've been using it for years. is really hard to find things that work on my skin cause I have extremely sensitive skin.  But this works for me.beautiful finish! * I think a lot of ppl dont think anout this brand a lot bc its not ""trending"". But its such a great TM. It makes my skin look better. It doesnt look like i have a layer of cake on. It evens out my complexion, adding a glow but nothing like a tin man-ish.  This is def an over looked product. It wears for hours wo looking patchy, separated. I cant say enough great things about this! * Blends away to basically no coverage but a lite orange dewy tint. * I don't understand why this doesn't get more buzz than it does. I've been using for 1.5 yrs, have been influenced to try 2 others in that time, and immediately go back to Halo. I do have to mix two neutral shades to get my summer color but that's typical for me. It stays put all day, doesn't settle into my wrinkles or pores, plays well with my other makeup, looks natural, has just the right amount of glow. I do wear a moisturizer under this bc my skin is very dry. I use this as my foundation year-around. Smashbox, please don't stop making this!!! * PROS:

‚Ä¢Blends in so easily.
‚Ä¢Stays put all day.
‚Ä¢Looks amazing on mature skin.
‚Ä¢Minimizes my fine lines
‚Ä¢Dewy & moisturized complexion 
‚Ä¢SPF 25
‚Ä¢Great color match 

My skin has blotchy red spots, but this Halo tint smooths out my skin tone so beautifully. I also have some fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead, but the tint doesn't settle into them. In fact, I'd say the product actually minimizes the appearance of my lines. My skin looks so dewy throughout the day. I really love this product and I hope it stays around forever! * This hands down is my summer go to tinted moisturizer. Sometimes I add a pump of foundation into it if I'm looking for a little bit more coverage. Keeps my skin hydrated. Gives the look like I'm not wearing makeup but just have a beautiful even skin tone. I wear this and a little bit of eyebrow pencil and I'm good. Like I said if I need more coverage I add a pump or two of foundation, which mixes well with all foundations. I like that there is some sunblock in it for days it's not super hot I don't add sunblock under my makeup. I saw a lot of reviews saying it broke them out, I have not had that problem. I also wash my face every night and put on face oil, no problem. In the morning I usually use a light water cream moisturizer. Highly recommend! I have middle-aged skin with discoloration no texture or wrinkles but I do have bigger pores. I continually purchase and stock up when it's on sale 10 out of 10. * I first bought the smaller size to get a better color match and to see if I liked the coverage. Great product with great coverage it has replaced my foundation."
84,84,84,84,polite society,more than a pretty face skin-caring foundation,pimprod2040619,2615146," * It took some finagling, but I absolutely love this new formula. The first time I tried it, I used WAAAY too much. Only one pump is needed to adequately cover your whole face. I was pleasantly surprised to see that single pump lasted throughout the day without breaking down, and it only needed some minimal touch ups in my T-zone * This foundation is so pretty on the skin. It feels like your wearing nothing but yet gives a great coverage. I truly enjoyed using it till the pump broke after a couple times and it got pit to the sode cause i hate not being able to pump out or squeeze my product * LOVE this foundation but the pump is awful. * I've been looking for a foundation that works with my acne prone skin, and finding a shade match has been hard. This is one of the first foundations that works with my skin and made it glow. * I don't just throw the word holy grail around lightly!  This truly is THE BEST foundation I have ever tried and I've been searching for years.  If you are looking for a truly pale, neutral, full coverage formula with a natural finish and long wearing, this is the one!  I chose the very fair neutral shade.  At first swatch, I thought it was too light, but once it dries down it is the perfect neutral, buttermilk biscuit shade for this pale girl!  For reference, it is neutral but darker than Too Faced Snow and lighter than Swan.  In Nars, it is neutral and in between Siberia and Oslo.  Its closest match is L'oreal's 24 Hour Freshwear in shade 395 Rose Pearl, very, very close, but a much better more natural coverage.  I have mature, pale skin with pores on my nose, chin and cheeks that you can drive a truck through, but this covers them beautifully and blurs them out like magic.  I did prime my skin, ironically with NYX Liquid Putty Primer and even though this is a water based foundation, there was no separation or clashing.  With one pump worked into my foundation brush, it glided on and covered all my redness and sunspots, but looked like smooth skin and lasted all day.  I do powder with Dermablend loose setting powder and did touch up on my chin, nose and forehead with residual once during the day, but other than that, it remained perfect!  I am so impressed!! * Love this foundation on my mature skin. Hate the packaging. The pump initially dispensed too much product, then clogged, dispensing no product. Bottle shape takes up a lot of room when traveling. Would be 5 star product if packaging changed. * Recently I went into Ulta to look for a new darker foundation for the summer. I was going to stick to what I had been using previously but saw the Polite Society Foundation on the display next to me. I'm obsessed with ""good-for-you-skin-caring-foundations"" and tried on a couple of shades in store. I finally settled on Light Neutral. For the past few days I've worn this foundation religiously! I only wear foundation occasionally because my skin usually gets irritated with everyday wear, but daily wear of this foundation has actually made my skin look better! I've changed nothing in my daily and nightly skincare routine that would aid in diminishing my acne, redness, and pores. It's led me to believe  that this foundation has actually been helping my skin! What makes it even better is it feels so lightweight going on, but provides so much coverage. I can't stand wearing foundations in the summer that feel heavy and greasy on the skin. I've worn this for 14+ hours and it still looks just as gorgeous as when I first applied it. I also did an ingredient search on all the individual ingredients to make sure the ""clean"" claims were true, and this foundation doesn't contain any overly irritating or dangerous/toxic ingredients like some other popular foundations. If you're looking for an all-around gorgeous, safe, and long lasting foundation, this is the one!"
85,85,85,85,est√É¬©e lauder,futurist skin tint serum foundation spf 20,pimprod2041704,2612381," * This color was a perfect match for my skin tone, which isn't always easy to find. I liked that it had spf just to up my coverage in the summer. However it has a thick and sticky texture that is hard to apply. I tried using my fingers without success coverage was splotchy and showed a lot of texture. Same problem when applying with a brush. Better coverage, but the coverage broke up halfway theough the day, additionally the texture was awful. I dont have any acne scarring or fine lines or wrinkles where texture was visible. * This is a great lightweight serum foundation for the skin just not for those who wants a natural matte look. I have oily to dry skin. I never realized i had dry patches until I used this product. It applied beautifully but within the hour i noticed it cling and accentuate dry patches. * I recently left Estee Lauder and tried a few other makeup brands, but this serum pulled me back. Im so happy i got this! It is perfect! Good coverage but light too! You wont be disappointed! I an 56 and this is great for my imperfections! * My skin has changed so much in my 40's and an Ester Lauder/Ulta rep tried this on me and all I could say was wow. Very luminous. The rep used a dry sponge but at home I use a wet sponge and it glides on and really improves the look of my skin. * Feels so good on my skin so much lighter than the doulbe wear. * I decided to purchase this since I love the full coverage foundation but was looking for a lighter coverage eveyday. I used the same shade for the full coverage and noticed this one did run slightly darker. However, its not that bad- so I kept it. I do finish it with setting powder and it looks nice. Haven't had any issues with it so far and I use it daily for work. * First of all, I'm a mature woman with some issues as you get older. Dry skin, brown spots, redness, lines ... hence, I like a foundation that offers some coverage and improves the look of my skin. Well, this foundation did it all for me! It covers my skin's  flaws and gives me a radiant glow, I love it! Highly recommended!"

I was really disappointed because in the bottle or on my skin without blending, it looks okay, but as soon as I blend it out it's super warm. I need an actually neutral or maybe slightly olive shade, and I don't even know how to find that because the shades include no description. I really don't want to go through the whole return process but this shade def won't work :( * Affordable, buildable. No complaints. Practically perfect * I used and spend more for my foundation, I discovered this about a month ago. I love it. Not creasing especially I  sweat  and the make up holds till my shift is over at work. Light but it covers what needs to be covered.Please don't change the formula!!! * It's very hard for me to find a match for my skin tone. I'm medium dark. Foundations are either too orange or too ashy. It's rare to find a foundation that the undertone is correct. This is the one. The match is dead on. Thank you! * This foundation makes me want to take off my makeup abd redo everything because it doesnt sitting well at all. * I had never used a Morphe product until a few months ago i was browsing in store and came across their Filter foundation. I got it home and loved it!  So when they came out with this one I decided to try it and its also a great foundation and different than the Filter one. Definitely more hydrating and the finish is glossier. I like to mix the two together and it comes out the best of both worlds. I can't believe i slept on Morphe for so long. * There is nothing hydrating about this foundation. It's great if you're looking for full coverage but on dry skin thick and looks cakey (even after a decent moisturizer). I had to mix this with another foundation to even use it."
88,88,88,88,est√É¬©e lauder,double wear sheer long-wear foundation spf 19,pimprod2027234,2586142," * As a very oily girl, i hate to say but i am disappointed. The doible wear is great for oily skin but i needed something light coverage and matte at the same time. I needed something to wear to work everyday. Unfortunately, my oily skin pertruded after a two hours snd i had to pat down my skin. So i recommend if you have you combo skin but for oily skin not necessarily. * I'm on the fence. Love the finish very natural. Doesn't settle in lines and wrinkles. Very runny and thin seems to take a lot of product to produce a full face coverage.  My 70yo skin on nose is breaking out a bit and this is only new product I am using so I'm just not sure  will keep trying * I really enjoy using this foundation. It is so lightweight, a perfect color match, and wears nicely throughout the day. It doesnt get overly oily/shiny in my T-zone where I experience that the most. Minimal setting into my fine lines and wrinkles - even less when I prep with a primer. 

I highly recommend! * I have dry skin and the regular estee lauder foundation wasnt for me. However, this one worked well. It's lightweight and still covers the small red and dark spots but I would not recommend it to someone looking for a full coverage. * For reference, I have fair warm toned, moderately oily skin. I usually wear 1.05 in Smashbox Studio Skin, and NC15 in MAC Waterweight. I wear 1n2 Ecru in this foundation. I love love this foundation. It is beautiful on, smooth, light coverage. I don't have a lot of dark spots or acne issues. I do have freckles and some redness, but not crazy. This coverage is perfect for me for daily wear. It plays with my other products. I don't get weird grainy break down around my nose, chin, and under my glasses at the bridge of my nose like I do with other foundations. It will last my 16 hour day and still look great, no fading or disappearing act. If you need full coverage, you can skip this one but if you just need an even out with a natural look, this is your girl. I thought Fenty EZ Dropz were the best thing ever until I tried this foundation, and now I won't touch the EZ Dropz again. * I go to a huge college in the South where it is often above 100 degrees outside, and I will wear this to football games and sit out in the direct sunlight and sweat for hours and it still looks just as good post game as when I put it on! I love this product and swear by it! It is expensive but I think it is worth the price. My only complaint is that I think they could give you a little more product for the price point, but the product itself is just so great I won't stop buying it! * Im so happy I found this product. It has truly changed the way i use make up. It such a lightweight foundation with light coverage like a tinted moisturizer, but its buildable like a foundation?! Its crazy. The vitamin E in it keeps it hydrating even tho is like a semi-matte kinda like how skin naturally is. And the fact that i can wear this to a concert, the beach, the gym, or out on the town completely unset (by any powder) and be sweating, or just going about my day and its will still look as amazing as it did when I applied it. This is a holy grail, must have babes."

Its buoldable and gives a natural glow. * purchase this for an everyday lower cost alternative to Anastasia not worth the money drying color is off and sits om the skin like paste. * Bought this foundation after It Cosmetics discontinued their matte cc cream. Although I am a matte girly myself, I find this CC cream to be very beautiful! I have oily acne prone skin and personally have not found the foundation to seep into my pores. While foundation stays on glowing for a full day running around in CA sun. Overall, pretty great foundation. * I want to like this, the coverage is great! On the other hand, my pores, which have never been an issue in my 29 years of life, are so visible? It looks like the foundation sinks into them or something? Just not for  me. * I really loved the idea of the hydrating Camo CC Cream since my skin is too dry for the original. I tried this one with power grip primer, liquid putty primer, and no primer. Every time it separated, and dried up like the Sahara in less than 4 hours. * I usually use the regular Camo Cream, but found it was drying out my skin a bit. This product does not, and it has the same coverage, which is great. Only drawback is that it has a slight sunscreen smell, which is not my favorite. * It seemed good at first, but then oxidized once on the skin for a bit. Doesn't help the skin to look vibrant and hydrated. If you have young, oily skin, this might work for you."

Heavy formula like a foundation. Pills over everything. Dries quickly. * This Urban Decay Tinted Moisturizer is absolutely amazing. The color blends flawlessly and does not settleinto fine lines.  The finish is dewey and beautifully natural. Definitely set you final look with s setting spray such as Urban Decay's All Nighter. 
Save your points if you have to, it's worth every  penny. * This has been in my foundation/tinted moisturiser rotation a couple years now. I do enjoy it, just in certain circumstances. Spring and summer shortish outtings, as it does fade in a few hours. I would never expect this to last more than five hours, even with powder/spray. It transfers easily, and does settle into pores/lines, but its easy to blend back out when this happens. Another super annoying thing is, it is hard to clean out of makeup brushes. I wash my foundation brushes every third use, but i can only use this twice before it needs cleaned out. * This is a lovely foundation. It blends easily does not cake and lasts all day. I Use a moisturizer underneath so the finish is a bit too shiny. I then apply Mallys poreless face defender w a dry blender sponge and get a semi dewy matt finish. I apply cream blush w a brush on top and both last all day without setting spray. The price is worth it because one tube lasts for over a year.

Im going to try the new UD one drop foundation with matt finish for humid summer months. * Decided to give a try because product was on sale at the time. Im used to tinted moisterizers having little to no coverage. However this is amazing!!!! Its like a lightweight foundation, has a beautiful dewy finish to it also. Formula is thin and so easy to build. I usually have a hard time color matching, but this is my exact shade! I have acne scars, so I applied moisturizer, NARS pot concealor on any dark spots and this on top. Perfect! Settled so well into my skin. I have combination skin, but the dewy finish is so subtle. Defintely recommend! ‚ô•Ô∏èü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü´∂üèª * Cant find a tintes moisturizer i love as much as this one. I'm just really sad that it does not have SPF in it.

Then I applied 3 small pumps directly on checks and forehead and blended it out with a foundation brush, set with Laura Mercier loose powder as well the Irbam Decay Setting spray. Dabbed everything in once again with beauty blender! Like that I rceived a beautiful even complexion that lasted all day in the hot and humid weather of South Texas! 
It covered my mild roseccia well! If you have dark spots or more secerr redness you can combine this with concealer!

Please do not change anything!! I do not have any cons for this product. * I recently purchased this and am very surprised how well I like it. I was seeking something that would provide decent coverage, and not feel mask-like or sweat off in this horrible heat and humidity. I have dry skin and typically have a hard time with foundation not making me look older because of settling. I apply two smaller pumps of this and use a dampened sponge to blend. It is easy to blend and provides a very pretty natural to satin finish. I did have a day outside where i was sweating terribly on my face and after using a paper towel to dab away the sweat my foundation held up flawlessly. * I have tried what feels like a milllllion foundations and bought this one on a whim when it was a dash to beauty deal. Despite the not so great reviews, I said why not because it was half off. And I am SO glad I did!!! This is now in my top 3 favorite foundations of all time!! The finish is absolutely beautiful, it's medium to full coverage and not cakey at all. It literally looks like you're wearing a filter and lasts me through my 10-12 hour work day where I am constantly running around and looks absolutley flawless by the end of the day. I am shocked about how great this foundation is and I am absolutely in LOVE! * I'd like to start off by saying I'm very impressed after my first application. I got it cuz it was 50% off and decided to try it out. I was more than pleased to discover that it truly is long lasting! It lasted all day running errands in triple digit heat and stood matte without looking dry and cakey! I have combination skin that leans a little more on the oily side and i have trouble keeping my face from looking greasy after an hour with other foundations, not without my skin looking terribly dry or cakey anyway. My face has never looked more flawless and even because it delivers great coverage while also feeling lightweight. I'm so glad I took a chance on this! I definitely will be purchasing again. * I normally use Estee Lauder Double Wear but decided to try this when they did the 40% off steal.Hands down love this so much better.I have aging skin and some days I am dry and some days I am oily. Sets so well on my skin without having to use a setting powder,just use all nighter setting spray and my skin looks great all day. * I love Smashbox products, usually. Lately, the foundation I normally buy (Too Faced) is always out in the color I need. So, I've been trying different foundations and wanted to try this one. Surprisingly, the color is a perfect fit, so I truly thought I found my foundation. That all turned to dust when the stuff quickly oxidized on my faces ans became very blotchy. I followed the recommendation of rubbing it in your hands before applying and even used a Smashbox primer. This stuff looked terrible. Such a shame. * In an attempt to find which shade would work for me, I used Ulta's in-app ""translation guide"" and imput three different foundations I own. Well, the result seemed questionable. (I do not think that is the in-app program's fault, although I would like it if it simply included an option that said: NONE of these are going to look good! ‚Äîwouldn't That be nice!! 
So, feeling rather ‚Ä¶ uncomfortable with the shade match results (and the other shade of similar ilk, I headed into my trusty local Ulta! 

Sadly I discovered the following: my skin tone is no where close to any of this products shade. Ugh! I even went in with the closest matching foundation that I wear, which is e.l.f CC Camo Cream in 150 C. ‚Äîwhy am i trying to spend More money on foundation??? Prolly because shopping is theraputic when it goes right! Lol  

With foundation sample in hand, it was idiculously obvious that None of these were gonna be even slightly close to my skin tone. 
I have classic Irish red hair, a pale but lightly freckled face, and green/blue with copper center eyes. My skin tome is therefore COOL, and my Season is True Autumn ‚Äîthis was profesdionally done.

I was getting tired of my liquid foundation on my jackets etc. This powder works on my melasma and my daughter just got it for under eyes. I plan on getting one for my mother for rosacea. * Great for fair skin.  Definitely something I'd recommend for good coverage and long lasting coverage. * I love it I'm obsessed with this brand * I've been using this product for a long time.  I've tried to use other powder makeup products and keep coming back to Estee Lauder Double Wear.  It's been hard to find one that covers this well. * This powder foundation works great! I had a wedding recently and i needed a powder to help with oil comtrol! This powder did just that! I used it during the wedding for oil control and it also has a beautiful matte finish! What a great foundation!"
98,98,98,98,dior,forever natural nude foundation,pimprod2036826,2604394," * Love this natural nude foundation.
it's a perfect coverage. I still love forever matte and the Glow Foundation but this one has a unique texture and quality that works very well on my skin.  I recommend it 100% thank you Dior. * I will start by saying this is a very nice, lightweight foundation. It has almost a water light feel on the skin and never has that mask-y feel (for someone with sensory issues this was a huge plus!). The color is a nice match and it does not oxidize at all. If you are looking for that ""glass skin"" effect, this will give it to you. The coverage is sheer to medium but I personally would not call this buildable  like the description says. 

Now the cons:

While I wanted to love this foundation, after a few wears it just left me underwhelmed. It still had a very nice skin like appearance but it didn't cover my acne or dark spots and did nothing to smooth my skin or blur pores. By hour 8 it had kind of settled and disappeared into my skin. Another bummer for me is the fact it has no SPF so I now have to find another product just to layer with it. Overall nice product but not for me * I just ordered and have worn it three times now and am hooked. It goes on beautifully, it has a smell but dissipates quickly. It does not oxidize like other high end foundations I have. I even got a massage and it lasted through my face on a massage table pillow. I can wear all day and not have to blot, I have an oily T-zone. It held up through hot and humid weather of the south eastern part of the country. * Overall this is a good foundation. It gives decent coverage and lasts well when properly set with powder. But, it's not good enough for the price tag. I have many more foundations that perform just as well or better for less money. * This foundation is everything I was searching for. I love that there is a cool rosy and the color match is perfect. It doesn't oxidize on my face and doesn't settle into lines. It's buildable also but with less than one pump and no powder it gives long lasting, glowy, coverage. * I am fair with cool pink tones. I have good skin and just wanted something to create an even complexion so I was really excited about this. I ordered 1CR and it oxidized horribly. Seemed like a color match until it set. I'm so sad because it seemed promising with it's claims. * I have been using the Skin glow for a long time they were out of my shade so I tried the natural nude and I will not be going back. this truly is perfect and lasts a long time. smooths my skin out and looks like no makeup, makeup"
99,99,99,99,mac,studio radiance serum powered foundation,pimprod2040797,2613967," * This foundation is amazing, I recently bought my second one and I believe this is the only shade that i found that goes with my skin color! 
It works well with combination skin, which thats what i have. Its super hydrating and coverage is great. * nice match * Bought this when it came out, hesitant at first because im an dehydrated and oily skin person. Figured out how to work with it and love it now. Perfect for a quick daily routine thats hasstle free because of the lighter coverage. Its definitely a light buildable coverage, but make sure your skin is prepped correctly. I set it with whatever powder I have on hand and its perfect.  

Waring that it can oxidize slightly, but its very similar to SFF by MAC. I use an NC 15 in both, but this one just sets a little darker. * I may be the only 30 something year old thats never worn MAC makeup‚Ä¶ BUT I wish I had a lot sooner than now. This makeup lasted through a 100+ degree day in Nevada and I just got home, its still on and looks great. Im a MAC believer. It did crease on my eyelids but eh whatever. It blends well on my combination skin (I used the 101 BK beauty brush to apply). I would recommend this to everyone, from acne prone skin to mature skin and everywhere between. Give it a try * I can see why people with normal to oil skin wouldn't like this, but I have have extremely dry, flaky, sensitive, acne prone skin and this looks amazing on me. Every other ""hydrating"" foundation I've tried doesn't last. by the end of the day, my skin looks dull and dehydrated while clingy onto all my dry patch. But not this MAC Serum-Powered foundation.   This glides smoothly over my dry skin, and gives me a beautiful glow that last all day. Because my skin is so dry, it never looks dewy or shiny, so this works perfect for me. * Hydrating * As I got to my 40's the MAC mat foundation was not work anymore as it used to. This new one is very hydrataiting and luminous. The only down is it gets a bit longer to dry out."

It doesn't look the absolute best, but its good enough for falling into the ocean. * So smooth and offers great coverage! I'll definitely be buying it again!! * I bought this in shade 332 and I love it! I've found for best results, apply with a damp beauty blender and use a good setting spray. I'm in a band and we play outdoors sometimes. I sweat a lot and I have oily skin. This foundation DID NOT MOVE! It covered my hyperpigmentation around my mouth and gave me flawless skin that lasted ALL DAY! It feels lightweight and doesn't transfer like liquid foundations. This is now my go to for the summer! I'm gonna buy 3 at a time from now on. * I dont know if its user error but ive never used a product that made my skin look so cakey and patchy. It settled in and and emphasized every pore on my face. * I'm not sure how anyone could dislike this stuff. My skin looks amazing and it covers my pores. The price point is great, too. * I love the label but was sad cause it was broken when I went it for the 2nd time I don't know how it broke cause it was in a case * Good coverage, yet light weight."

Also, after caking so much of the power onto my face and setting it with setting spray (yes, even All-Nighter) my t-zone gets oily and basically melts my makeup off within only a couple hours.

Please Tarte  keep this one!!!!! * I really like the coverage this gives.  I'm not a fan of liquid foundation so this gives me the coverage I like without all the blending. This is the second one I've purchased BUT, I thought it was me, a fluke, my skin, application error, but after seeing it mentioned in another review- I realize it's not just me. I even purchased the recommended brush to apply! The issue is the ""hard pan"" it gets after just one use. The first one did the same thing,  I had to scrape it off to be able to use the product, this second one only half the surface of the powder has the hard pan problem. Unfortunately,  at the cost of the powder and the it takes to dig it out each time, I'll go back to using the shape tape pressed powder. * I bought 12N for my fair skin and it matched very well, it does look pretty nice once it's on the skin and I have pretty difficult skin when it comes to any foundation type of products. I have some texture, lines, redness, and large pores (actually large, not the kind that you have to stare into a magnifying mirror to see), finding foundations and powder foundations isn't always easy for me, so it is a pretty big deal when a product looks nice on the skin and this one really does! What I don't like about it is that I normally just use the applicator sponge that comes with powder foundations and I don't think it was this little thin sponges fault because I tried it with my preferred powder foundation sponges too and none of them worked great, so I had to end up using a beauty blender type of sponge, which I never use with powder foundations. I like the portability of a powder foundation and adding a big sponge is not what I'm looking for when I'm using a powder foundation, but it's not that big of a deal either. The biggest issue I had, which I'm so surprised no one else has said this, and maybe I got a particularly hard pressed compact, but the product does not come out easily, I actually have to scrape a layer off the top and then apply it as a sort of loose powder foundation and I would have just returned it because of how much extra effort it takes for a product I normally use when I'm in a hurry, but the end result is actually nice, so I am finishing this product up and I think I will probably try at least a second one to see if I got a bad batch or if this is just how it is and I'm the only one who has had trouble getting any product on a sponge."

Save your money for something else. * Well, i have to say that i am a huge pat mcgrath fan but this foundation for me oxidizes a bit and doesn't give me that airbrush look i hunt for.  Gonna stick with my too faced * Beautiful satin foundation!
Not too matte and not too dewy. 
It's very runny so all I need is one pump. It blends easily with a brush or sponge. It feels light weight and doesn't crease in my smile lines. I pair it with the Too Faced BTW concealer. Shade matching was easy, I wear shade M21 which is a perfect neutral. I recommend this foundation to anyone willing to splurge. * Over the past year and a half, I have been on the journey to find a foundation that doesnt transfer, is very longwearing, and doesnt settle into my smile lines. I have tried close to 20 foundations, and none come close to this one. It is the BEST foundation i have ever tried! Buildable coverage too. Ive never gotten more compliments on my skin! A forever repurchase. * I normally love Pat McGrath makeup, and find it to be worth the price. However, I can't say the same for the foundation. I've tried applying it with different brushes/sponges, with/without primers, and/or setting sprays. No matter what I do, it doesn't wear well on my skin. First off, it's quite runny. It applies patchy/streaky, so I feel like I realy have to work with it. Then, within a short amount of time it begins to settle into any lines and separate, especially around my nose. I definitely won't be purchasing this again. * I went through bottles of other foundations, high end and drugstore before I came across this one. I got it as a sample first. I thought just try it out, see how it goes and fell in love with it. It glided perfectly onto my skin, so lightweight and blended naturally. It doesn't settle into my fine lines or wrinkles and feels like I am wearing nothing on my skin. I don't like heavy foundations or makeup on my skin, so this was perfect. I get so many compliments now on how great my makeup looks, all thanks to this foundation! Love it!"

I also havent found any setting powders that look good with this :\ unfortunately i wouldnt reccomend it even though i really wanted to like it! * I really had higher expectations in this product, I tried it with different primers and it still would look splotchy and added additional texture to my face.

Its creamy, thick but blends very smooths. I love it * This foundation is gorgeous! Glides on and blends like a dream. * Has a beautiful radiant finish but also full coverage but bulidable. My skin has never looked so airbushed before. I recommend using a brush to blend. * I have used this stick foundation for a couple years and have always been satisfied when applying with one of the fabulous Hourglass brushes BUT in a pinch I applied with a damp sponge and the finish blew me away. Hands down the very best foundation when applied with a damp sponge. It is now my everyday must wear foundation. Take care not to apply tol much or it sits on your skin and will transfer.

However, it does leave a greasy ""after feel"" on my skin despite only being on for about 30 minutes and it definitely has a sunscreen scent to it. * Wyn beauty knocked its debut out of the park with this tinted spf, as the product itself is lightweight and provides just enough coverage while still looking ""natural.""
However, the bottle the product is in makes it hard to give it anything higher than a 3. There isn't a lot of product for the price, and there is no eco-friendly refillable options. 
My bottle specifically stopped pumping after being used twice, I've tried turning it, unscrewing it, washing it, etc. and it no longer pumps the product out. Can't say if others have experienced this issue. 

I wish the product was in a more sustainable & value friendly bottle (that works more than a couple times)! * I love this so much that I  neglecting my other skin tints for this. The color match is perfect for me and it is extremely light weight. It plays well with my Laura Mercier primer. The best part is the spf but i also wear spf underneath just to be safe. * I have been wanting this skin tint for the longest time and when I tell you it's 100% worth the buy I mean it. I love everything about it and it's perfect for us that live in a warmer weather, I do suggest to shade match in store since it does oxidize or if you don't have an ulta available nearby use findation to find your match (I did this and turned out the shade they suggested was the shade that matched me when I tried in store). Cannot talk about this product enough miss Serena Williams rlly outdid herself on this one! * Definitely subjective but 225 is the best shade for me that I've ever found. I model and finding a natural tone is everything. I counter any oxidizing with a translucent powder (banana or tinted depending on my suntan). The smell doesn't bother me and it is not heavy. BUT what a curve for the application. Sometimes it really plays well and other times it pills HORRENDOUSLY. I literally started my routine from scratch last week and I've had it since it launched. But again, when it applies nicely, it works really well and the shade is making me determined to figure it out! * Love it! Excellent shade match with the matching tool. Held up during this heat wave, just make sure youre nice & dry in a cool setting, so you can set it properly and it will last. That may be an issue for me and not others but I sweat on my face alot, so I have to follow above for it to be flawless! It's very light weight, It doesn't feel like anything is on my face, it's buildable but I don't need to build, I just want to play in makeup lol, even though it's a skin tint. it's perfect for all ages as I'm over 40. If you're active such as gym, walker, jogging, etc, this is for you (after setting). I didnt have a grey cast on my face (Spf issue on melanin) I already recommended and ordered again. My shade is 375- Strength. Thank you Serena for this amazing beautiful skin care tint! I wanted to add a photo but I don't see where to do so. * Looks very natural and works amazing even when you workout !"
106,106,106,106,hourglass,ambient soft glow foundation,pimprod2033509,2599657," * I wanted to like this foundation but it creased and accented every wrinkle and dry patch!  I looked almost 10 years older with it on.  I tried all kinds of ways to make this work  but it always came out the same.  For reference. I am 55 years old and my skin is dry.  The only way i could recommend this is for people 45 or younger. * I'm gonna give some main points and then elaborate because I have so much to say about this foundation.

1- it is a buttery smooth application
2- it gives the prettiest subtle glow, but it's somehow still soft matte
3- it IS transfer-proof if you set it with powder and/or setting spray

As far as the shade range- I always have to mix my foundations anyway so it doesn't really bother me. In response to it transferring- most non-ultra-matte foundations do. So like with every other, if you use powder or a good setting spray (or both) then you're good to go. 

I have oily-combination and sensitive skin, and this is my favorite foundation out of everything I've ever tried. I honestly didn't want to love it so much because it's much more expensive than I'd like, but I've tried to replace it and nothing works or looks as well. I have a lot of acne scarring, but people always say my skin looks so smooth and clear with this on. I love using it with the mineral veil primer and together they are just ü§åü§å I highly highly recommend. * I love how a little of the product goes  a long a way. I apply with a brush sometimes fingers. It looks beautiful, but after an hour I can't wait to wash it off. For some reason it makes my face feel icky and slimy after an hour . It feels even worse with the hour glass primer and have combo to dry skin. * Ive used many foundations and i have acne. I decided to buy this one since the one I usually get (Dior Glow) was not im stock. This foundation is BLURRING!!! IT MAKES ME LOOK SO GOOD!! I work 8 hours shifts at work and IT STILL LOOKS FRESH. I RECOMMEND HIGHLY! makes my makeup honestly last. * Been using this the past few months, and won't be repurchasing. No matter what i do prep wise, this stuff transfers and is gone within a few hours. Was told this was good for combination oily skin and it slides right off my face. Only good part is it is very good coverage, but sometimes doesn't blend out well. * This foundation is beautiful on the skin!! I hesitated to buy it since it had moxed reviews, especially the girlies that have oily skin. However, it literally hid all my redness, it feels super lightweight and it gives a natural matte finish. 10/10 recommend! * Applies well and wears well for me, with or without a primer.

109,109,109,109,covergirl,simply ageless skin perfector essence foundation,pimprod2042952,2618803," * This stuff is the definition of ""your skin but better."" I've tried SO many tinted serums, wasted so much money on $40+ brands for them to be useless. I've found the easiest way to apply this is directly to your face, then blend with fingers, then blend out with a beauty blender. 

I have sensitive skin and rosacea, this is the first product I've ever used that didn't irritate or break out my skin. And weirdly, despite having pretty light coverage, this does an amazing job at covering my redness. Covering actually might not be the right word, it's more like toning almost. It doesn't look like I have anything on, yet still seems to almost eliminate my redness (which has always been severe). I have no clue how this works, I swear it's magic because  I cannot understand it. 

Coverage is somewhat buildable, but definitely meant to be used lightly. It'll get cakey if you set it with powder, and then if it gets wet it'll lift really weird, but I don't ever feel the need to use powder. Powder blush and brozer work fine over it, just not setting your whole face. I'll go all day just with this and not get oily at all, it doesn't slide off like other tinted serums, and when it does wear it looks really natural. A bit sticky at first but it will dry down, and feels like there's nothing on your face! Definitely is somewhat waterproof, by far the most oit of any other product like this I've tried. 

I've worn this to bed many times without any breakouts, and in the morning I truly can't tell whether there's any of it left on my face (in a good way), because my skin looks better after wearing this. Probably the bakuchiol, which is what prompted me to buy it bc I already use a serum with that every night that I love. 

And again, I don't have great skin to begin with, and I've gotten endless compliments on my skin since I started using this. People saying my rosacea looks better, pores, texture, etc. 

I don't bother with reviews much, but man, every time I use this stuff, every time I look in the mirror I can't stop thinking how good my skin looks, and how natural. * The first few times I used this I thought it looked beautiful on the skin when first applied. But noticed after being on my skin for a little bit my skin felt tight. I should have looked at the ingredients first. Benzyl Alcohol is pretty high on the list of ingredients. unfortunately, it makes my already dry skin drier. * I've used this a few times and have been loving it on my no makeup makeup days when I don't want a full coverage base. I get hormonal acne along my chin so it tends to leave acne scars, so this doesn't fully cover them up but it still gives a natural finish. 

It leaves my skin looking healthy, covers my spider veins, provides light coverage under my eyes in place of concealer, and gives me an all around healthy glow. 

I do 2 pumps and rub it between my hands first then spread evenly onto my face before using a brush to buff it out. I recommend this if you're starting out with makeup or if you prefer a natural finish. * This is so beautiful if you mix it in your hands first, apply with fingers and finish with a sponge. It's so skinlike and lasts all day for me. However‚Äî why did they put bakuchiol in it üò≠ I didn't think it would be that noticeable but I can't wear this everyday or else it starts stinging. Such a shame because I love how it looks and want to wear it everyday! I wish brands would keep makeup and skincare separate. * I LOVE this so much. At first it took a minute to figure out how to apply it. 
First I blend it with my fingers until the water is blended, then i take a sponge or brunsh and tap to smooth the coverage. 

For me, a normal / dry skin girlie this is perfect for daily wear. Better than a lot of high end foundations that Ive tried. * Simply Ageless Skin Perfector Essence is a game-changer for my makeup routine! Its foundation-boosting effects leave my skin looking flawless and radiant. I love how lightweight and hydrating it feels, providing a natural yet polished finish that lasts all day. Plus, with its age-defying properties, it's become a staple in my beauty regimen, helping me achieve a youthful glow effortlessly. If you're looking for a foundation that not only enhances but also nourishes your skin, this is definitely the one to try! * I've worn higher end foundation for the past 20 years. 

I bought this and did a side by side - half of my face with my $50+ foundation and 1/2 this. The side with this on it looks better than the expensive side. Shocked! 

Is it lighter coverage but really super nice. No scent which is a bonus. Be sure to premix on hand prior to application. 

Also i got compliments on my skin when i wore this.

Still in shock this is Cover Girl. Apparently the drug store brands have completely upped  their game."

I am a fan of L'Oreal just not this one. * I dont like yhat everything had nucinimide its so irritating for mt skin :( * This product is just okay. Application is great, easy to blend and definitely buildable. I started with just one layer first with my fingers but it didn't blend well so went in with a brush. I may try again with a beauty blender because the brush wasn't bad but it was trying to cling to texture and dry patches. It wore well around my pores (not well in fine lines!!) until i tried to do a touch up. It just moved everything and removed the base completely. I would recommend embracing any texture or oil because you can't touch this foundation up dyrung the day. * So I bought this to try and replace my IT CC because of the white cast that always shows up on my skin. Unfortunately, for my skin tone, the white cast on this product was worse. I loved the way it felt going on, and it was even. I apply with my fingers, and still achieve the even look. it's just my chin is a little darker so any white is noticeable. I had to use more bronzer to minimize it than when I use my CC. it didn't irritate my skin and I wore it all day. I am trying the Infallible Foundation because I really want something sweat proof, with less SPF to minimize the white cast. * I have dry skin but I take really good care of it. This foundation brought out dry patches I didn't even know I had. I wished it worked for me. My skin looked awful. I don't recommend for people with dry skin. * I am 49 with nice skin.  Clear complexion.  Fair toned.  I stopped using foundation a few years back and switched to Maybelline BB fresh cream with spf.  I much prefer the Maybelline to this.  I thought perhaps the Loreal would work better than other foundations I had tried prior to using the Maybelline exclusively.  Wrong‚Ä¶ not for me.  The cream beige color seemed to suit me fine but I found the formula drying and it was settling into the very fine lines pn my forehead.  I also found it was not that easy to apply.  I am always well 
moisturized so it shouldn't be an issue.  I use s beauty blender to put the Maybelline on snd felt this should have been no different.  I ended up using my Maybelline on top of the Loreal and it was better.  Will not repurchase the Loreal. * I read in somewhere that this was one of the top 10 foundations options for skins at age 40+. Since it's required some glowing the product offer great coverage, a natural look and the color was perfect to my skin. If you are looking something like this, it's an affordable option and for every day it's a great product."

This particular brand was recommended and I found a shade I really liked. But when I tried to apply it, it was extremely difficult to blend and it ended up looking very cakey and streaky.  I use a good moisturizer but it was like I was trying to apply foundation and it was drying before I had a chance to blend it. I will continue looking ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ * I absolutely love this foundation so far. I haven't found a foundation and skincare hybrid that I actually liked yet and this one is amazing! I can say that I do feel like I'm wearing makeup but this is by far the most comfortable foundation I've worn. it didn't crease on me throughout the day, it didn't separate, it was just so comfortable and my skin felt hydrated without looking oily. I wish in store they had all the shades because the shade I got is a little too light and the shade I would have liked to try is online only but I just bronzed it up to not make myself look pale. * Idk how this foundation isn't more raved about. I have tried so many foundations (high and low end) and this is my favorite foundation ive ever tried. I have combinagion skin and my face is usually melting off by thr end of a work day and this lasts me all day and is flawless. Its so light on my face! I just can't say enough good things. Its packagaing is so cute and doesnt take up too much room in my makeup bag and i love that its not heavy glass! Please never stop making this foundation, Ari!! ü©∑ * I wanted to love this foundation really badly because the concealer that I have is absolutely perfect but unfortunately, this is not for the sensitive skin girlies! I just wanted to note that I have oily, acne-prone skin. The first hour of wearing, I was completely stoked because I thought that I looked great, mind you I had only looked at my face in a mirror from far away. After a few hours of wearing, I took a closer look into the mirror and I saw that little red/textured bumps had formed on my cheeks. I also realized that my shade oxidized darker than my skin tone. At first I was going to just buy a lighter shade since I wanted to give this product another chance, but I can't get past my face breaking out and don't want to do anymore damage so I'm just going to return it completely. I'm really sad this didn't work out for me smh. * This foundation blends out smoothly and feels like it has a more natural finish. Definitely my go to foundation. * I was so excited about this because of the reviews, but it's not good for my 53 yr old face. The color was perfect but after it dries down, was cakey, showed every pore and caused some dry patches. I even used very little of it. I also tried to use different primers and even tried mixing it with a moisturizer. It's bad & wish I could return it. I'm sticking with my pur minerals tinted moisturizer from now on."
114,114,114,114,chanel,les beiges water-fresh complexion touch,pimprod2037597,2595874," * Unlike any other foundation or concealer that I've tried.  Literally, this is magic.  Evens tone, covets flaws, smooths every textural flaw, diminishes pores, seems to moisturize any dry patches, and feels like I'm wearing no makeup.  It's absolute must-try for anyone over 50yo and doesn't love the typical look of foundation. Yes, I'm ordering a backup. * I tried the Water Fresh Tint when it first came out and didn't like it at all. There was absolutely no coverage. This though, is what i was hoping for with the tint. The Complexion Touch is so good. It's beautiful on the skin and has a light to light medium coverage, and it feels like nothing on the skin. Don't use the brush that comes with it to apply because its way too small, however I've found that its a really good concealer brush. My only gripe with this foundation is that you go through it pretty fast. Im already halfway through my second bottle and this stuff is pricey. But it's totally worth it. * Love it, it's moisturizing without getting too oily, wears light on the face and doesn't look cakey. Easy to throw in the purse. * Just not for me. It feels heavy and greasy. I couldn't stand it. * I have tried different bases and no matter what base I use, this pills awful! Rubs off as I'm applying. Have tried with a brush and using fingers. Try another Chanel product. * I loved this foundation, is super light weight and easy to blend. It keeps my skin hydrated and looks natural. A little goes a long way. Perfect for winter when my skin is dry * This is obe of my favorite foundations for days when i font gave breakouts but i need to look pulled together ot my skin needs a boost. I apply with fluffy buffer type brush and it evens my skin tone and leaves it looking plump and juicy. I'm 51 and my skin type leans drier, with redness and some dark circles. I don't need s concealerwith this base. Worth the price, for me."

Its lightweight and buildable.  It's so velvety and looks like skin. I will continue buying this. * Best full coverage * I'm a medium cool neutral skin tone with oily combination skin - 540 Giza.
I layer usually with additional contouring darker shades to warm up my skin tone and add more dimension, but it's very light, minimual layering, as I do not like to wear anything heavy.

This foundation is awesome! I L O V E it because of how much a little goes a long way. I tend to prep my skin with moisturizer and primer for smoother application. I tend to apply light layers, which may be way this product has lasted so long for me - I do not like thick layers, nor do I feel that I need to layer so much of the product to get decent coverage. It has a nice mattifying effect, but does not accentuate lines or cause any unflattering crepe-y undereye area. If you're looking for something ""glowy"" or something of a pearlescent finish like a CC cream or tinted moisturizer, this may not be for you - it is quite mattifying, and despite my light handed application (like I mentioned earlier, a little goes a long time), it does offer good coverage without the cake-on effect. 

In pictures, it helps my face look more even and helps with my shiny t-zone area. 

I got these when they were 50% off, and had purchased 2. I know my first tube I'm currently on is nowhere close to being out, but I do wear foundation only on special occasions. 

I live in hot humid Texas, and have yet to experience any breakout with this product. * It gave me extremly bad breakouts it was patchy it would cling to dry areas and accentuate texture/pores it rubs off throughout the day * I constantly get compliments on my beautiful skin and I don't even have a skin care regimen aside from washing my face and regular lotion. I love their shade range since even more expensive brands get deeper shades wrong. * I wanted to love this so much. But after 3 tries with different products underneath  I could not get it to work. This did not blend into my skin. The shade Bali was way too dark even though I use that shade in other products. It also oxidized on me. * I LOVE this foundation; however, I so wish they had some lighter shades! Don't get me wrong, they have an AMAZING shade range and are so affordable, but my skin is the shade of a napkin so even their lightest shade looks a bit orange on me. I still use it because I love the formula that much, but would love to see a few lighter shades :)"

This looks like you are wearing heavy makeup. It accentuates pores and peach fuzz-even with primers. The color I ordered (16B) seemed off. I honestly thought I received the wrong color because it was so dark and orange. I have 20B shape tape concealer that I compared side by side with this product on my skin, and the 20B looks way lighter and cooler compared to this in 16B. I have used their foundcealer in 16B in the past and it was a decent match. So good luck finding a match with the color inconsistency of this product! * I love this CC cream! Idk how it hasnt gone viral. One layer evens out my skin. I apply a little more or shape tape concealer where i want extra coverage. This is definitely not a full coverage foundation, but for those of you who are looking for the perfect every day coverage this is it! I have combination skin and this is great on both my dry and oily spots. The only con I have is that it does expire quickly * I love the way it covers my spots and matches perfect. * I bought this because I wanted some thing to even out my skin tone, and was tired of using concealer all over my face. So I was basically looking for a light foundation. I have dry spots on my cheeks, and this worked because it is 
very hydrating. The only con is that I have slight discoloration on my cheeks, and the coverage is nearly nonexistent, so I need to wear a large amount to cover the discoloration. I like that it has sunscreen and looks natural. * I truly enjoy this product! I apply it with a damp beauty blender, and this way I get a medium coverage. Wherever I feel I need a little more coverage, I apply concealer. Leaves my skin looking natural and healthy. I have dry and sensitive skin, and this works great! * I bought this foundation because I have dry skin & red patches on my face. Thought this product was a great color match (16B), but the formula is very thick. It took several tries on application to figure out the best technique. I found appling with my fingers & then using a dampened beauty blender to help blend in the foundation was key. 
I could not use primer underneath this product because it ""peeled"" so i did feel like my pores were more defined then I like. 
The product wore & lasted all day. It does become a bit shiny but a simple blot helped. 
I wanted more from thos product because of the cost."
118,118,118,118,exa,high fidelity foundation,pimprod2019009,2573283," * This is an undetectable foundation on my mature, dry skin, though it can build easily for extra coverage. I will just add additional drops on those darker spots, which still peek through but look more homogenous. But coverage is not my main concern, so this winner maintains the slightly dewy glow over a well -prepped skin base, still looking un made-up by the end of the day. Also, goes over mineral sunscreen flawlessly. IMO it is on par with Haus Labs, Nars Radiant LIght, MUF reboot; my other favs. I am trying another shade, though am happy with Katey, the match I found via the skin models- so that's my recommendation for finding your shade, rather than the description. It is on sale, so... TRY IT! * I'm assuming this foundation is on clearance because of quality issues‚Ä¶ I received my order and the formula is completely separated and cannot be mixed back together to a good consistency. * I was so surprised when i first used it, my skin looked like skin. I like a lightweight natiral finish and this gives me exactly that! It also stays on all day/night, only thing is that it oxidizes a little bit but not wnything drastic. Has been my go-to foundation for over a year already! * good match for hard shade (fair/light olive) and good for sensitive/acne prone/scar/texture skin. decent coverage but feels light and natural. but doesnt really set (makeup smudges on my cat) & taking the top off pulls the entire pump out sometimes * I have used this foundation for a few years and it's never let me down. I fluctuate between a range of their lighter, cool toned shades depending on the time of year. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. A few things I've learned along the way: 

*A thin base layer will cover most spots and uneven tones. If you need more coverage, then spot treat with a little more foundation.
*It pairs beautifully on top of Nudestix tinted sunscreen.
*Applies well with brushes or sponges, but better with your fingers.
*A stippling, dabbing motion is the best method to apply the thin layers.

I'm 41, and I receive many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation, and I feel like I look more youthful with this on. I will definitely continue to repurchase! * I wish I liked this product! I have combo skin and have been searching for a foundation that works for my skin. 
I've tried countless brands. This one seemed to never set, it stayed moist the entire time unless I put powder over it. I've tried several primers and setting powders and light face powders. Of coarse all at separate times. I spaced it out too. I tried each primer a few weeks time to rally give it a chance. I feel the liquid eyeshadow in this brand is the same way. This foundation bottle also leaked and I was wiping it before and after every use. * It says Carolina, but I actually purchased Gretta. I generally don't wear foundation because I hate the heavy feel, but this foundation is light and really comfortable. I like a no makeup makeup look and this really does the trick. That means my skin looks smooth and glowy but also natural and fresh. I also love that the ingredients are natural and beneficial for my skin."

Also found my perfect shade However started getting breakouts everytime I used it * First. Its a must shake product. So shake shake shake‚Ä¶. Shake shake shake. The first time you have to shake forever but if you do it you have zero run in the liquid. Apply with fingers and you get exactly as advertised and one pump. I like my beauty blender so i get a more raident sheer coverage. I used fingers to warm product and press in skin for makeup photo that i want a more medium coverage. Lets face it. Im 38 and not 20. Less becomes more and i have dry cheeks and oily t zone. This makes me glow and vibrant without creasing. Now i did build this up and enough of any product will eventually crease which it did. Again im closer to 40. But for acne prone and combination skin i truly love this. The shake shake shake can be tiresome when im just trying to get this on quick but no skipping this step. Shake shake shake and one solid drop gives me what im looking for. If i may add i hate using my fingers but seriously best for medium coverage and this is exactly what BE claims it to be. So my new love * I like the old formula so much better!! This just sits on your skin and feels greasy! My skin did not like this make up! I broke out in red dots. I will be returning it. * I bought this hoping it would be like the Bare Minerals Skin Brightening serum foundation from a few years ago that was discontinued, but sadly, it's not. I miss the old version. The Pure Serum Radiant Foundation is extremely runny if you don't shake the bottle A LOT (almost to the point of exhaustion) before use. It would help if mixing beads were in the bottle like they were in the previous Skin Brightening Serum. If you shake the bottle thoroughly, the foundation will be a creamy consistency that blends nicely and wears well all day. If you don't shake it thoroughly, the foundation will be very runny and will look oily on your skin and won't stay on long. I was ready to return it at first, but once I figured out that I need to shake the bottle excessively, I liked it much better. I would buy it again (now that i know the trick), but please ‚Ä¶ add some mixing beads to the bottle and consider switching to a plastic bottle (like the old serum was in). I'll never understand why products are discontinued, only to be brought back with a new name or altered version that's never as good as the one that was discontinued. * I've been using this foundation for several months. It is very pretty on. I find it needs to be applied with fingers after dotting it around the face. I apply over serums, moisturizer and sunscreen that has set for 15 minutes or longer.  I get compliments on it even though it is very sheer and I have a lot of sun spots.  I've not found a prettier light coverage foundation. I set it with bareMinerals Mineral Veil loose powder.  I find the bareMinerals powder concealer works well on my skin with this foundation . * i tried multiple times with different applications and primers‚Ä¶. It is the opposite of what it says. Its powdery and matte. Shows every line on your face no matter how much to try to blend and reblend or finish it. Made my dry skin appear drier. * Love the glow it gives my skin and buildable coverage. Shake well before using! I applied over my normal primer with a sponge, finished with translucent pressed powder and setting spray. Held up all night and still looked good when I got home."

I dont think I've ever had a foundation i thought looked this natural. I highly recommend it, and am thinking of getting the full size for my everyday makeup too. * I tried this in store for the first time and IMMEDIATELY purchased.  This is the only brand ever that calls itself full coverage that actually IS.  it didnt settle into my fine lines, and created an absolutely FLAWLESS LOOK! * I dont personally wear foundation any more but when i did i used this and a little definitely goes a long way.

I know bad habit but it be like that sometimes. I bought the primer that goes with this as well and man what a fail it all was. Idk what the goal of this foundation is but it straight up refuses to set in any capacity. I knew i was in trouble almost immediately after it just kept moving... This didnt cover imperfections well, settled into my creases instantly and no matter what i did the foundation just broke apart. I even tried with a mattifying primer hoping that would help set it‚Ä¶NOPE. Tried to push through and set everything with a powder and everything just broke apart. You could literally scrape the product off of my face because it was just a greasy broken mess. I have normal skin, no acne and minimal uneveness in my skin tone and this worked horribly. I honestly was flabbergasted by how much trouble i had applying this. I will say it looks very nice from far away but thats where it ends. I know the glowy dewy look is popular but this simply does not practically translate in this product for everyday wear...Idk who wants to walk around all day with wet foundation that will transfer if the wind blows too hard but its not me. A greasy broken mess and im mad i wasted my money on this. * Very cakey * this foundations gotta be the worst thing ive ever tried and the jet black shade is horrible. * I think you know what I mean‚Ä¶people with dark skin still have undertones and are not pure black! Really, Youthforia? I thought you were an innovative brand! * For me this is a fairly good/well rounded kind of foundation. The finish is definitely on the more natural side, but can provide buildable coverage. Like most foundations it will start to wear a bit after a long day, but no major weird observation noted. I have not slept in this, but it does not break my skin out or cause irritations or anything. Mix well with a primer or moisturizer for sheer/more natural days * Don't buy it's bad.

The previous tinted moisturizer covered much, much better, smoothed my complexion, covered imperfections, and I could use less. The new formula is more watery and just...isn't it. Not worth it. Please bring back the old formula!"

It was SO BAD. I was excited because they have a great range for pale shades, but after wearing it for a bit it oxidized SO bad and I looked orange. It also went on cakey and dry, and gave me almost no coverage when applied with a brush. It felt hard to blend. Not recommended. * This compact is a game changer! It blends perfectly with my skin and gives a flawless finish!! * I tried the Juvia's Place powder foundation for everyday office wear, when I need to get ready in a hurry. It is good, smooth, blurs pores and is buildable. Available in a wide range of shades too! Good buy for the price. * It oxidezes but i went down two shades and works fine. Its affordable and gets the job done. I use it as a finishing powder. It blurs and keeps makeup in place. Is not drying. * As someone with dryer skin this product does not make my face feel dry. It blurs my pores and gives me a flawless base. Not to mention the great shade range! * I'll buy this forever! It is so versatile, it can be used for no makeup makeup when you just want to mattify the face or it can ve used to set multiple cream products to lock your makeup in place. Plus one pan will last you years!!"

Using a press shine eliminator my be helpful for oiler skin.  I love this foundation and I will be purchasing it again. * I came in hoping to get what I usually used but my shade was not in stock.  I walked around the store looking for something I could use.  Came upon this product and color was perfect.  I bought two in case I run out. * This is greasy and rubs off easily.  Also is not shade inclusive for lighter skin. I am light skinned and not fair and the couple of shades are horrible. * I didn't expect to love this product this much. I've only tried Blk/Opl concealer once before but decided on this last minute. Such a great purchase! It almost looks like full coverage but it's lite weight and build able. * If you have dry skin dont do it‚Ä¶ I applied my Georgio Armani concealer using my beauty blender and completely separated everywhere. * I love that it's not super expensive and the color looks great on my complexion.

Also the shade martinique is the best fitting for my skin tone that ive ever found. * This has been one of the only foundations that I have ever tried that doesn't oxidize! This foundation has cherries in it which can be really good for the skin that also gives it an amazing scent. The foundation is a thick consistency but doesn't feel heavy and doesn't cake up. Since I have skin just like everyone else obviously no product will ever completely cover up skins imperfections but for someone who has bigger pores and oilly skin I feel like it minimizes them and covers up acne well without clinging to them and my dry patches on my nose. The foundation stays on all day long and my skin has never looked better. Overall this is the best foundation I have tried the shade range is amazing as someone who is really pale I always have a hard time finding a foundation that isn't orange, won't oxidize bad, and is light enough. Obviously juvias caters towards darker skin tones but I still love this brand! The shade ranges are amazing and all of the products are so pigmented! Even if you don't buy this foundation I would definitely but their eyeshadow or something and support this black owned brand! The best affordable products out there comes from here! thanks juvias. * This is the first and last foundation I'll use and easy to find skin tone because of diversity * I bought this  because I love the original matte formula but i always mix it with other foundations because it can be drying on me.  I thought if i could just get my shade (Cebu) in the luminous it would be the a perfect match to the original, but its not.It also oxidizes on me terribly if i wear it alone. The pump is also just nonfunctional- but thats not a dealbreaker . I do it use it semi-regularly to mix it with other foundations and I love the watermelon scent that it has but it will not be a repurchase for me. * I love this foundation! it's a great medium/full coverage. I have acne scarring and some acne, and it covers it all perfectly! * I love this brand, and I wanted to love this foundation. Unfortunately, no matter how little I apply, it always looks cakey. Another gripe I have is the dispenser does not work well at all. 

I plan to try using this as a concealer, it may work well for this.
I am 40, my skin is dry. * This foundation is lighweight, glowy, easy to blend, I absolutely love it. Im so happy i found it. Im on my 3rd bottle"

However, the scent is SO overwhelming. It's like walking into a nursing home and a perfumery all at once. The smell does not dissipate either after wearing it, it stays pretty strong throughout most of the day. * Great coverage * Poor coverage but if I had gotten the correct shade I think I would have been pleased * Great powder foundation at a great price! It covers well and looks great on my skin tone. Can't beat it for the price. Will buy again. * usually it's hard for me to love a powder foundation just as itself, I usually add a powder to add more coverage on top a liquid foundation, but this is Amazing on its own! I make sure to moisturize well and I apply this with a brush or triangle puff and spray a good amount of setting spray and Wow,so beautiful and fast! | literally bought 2 extras as backup, please never stop making this. very much a high quality product, and I have oily combo skin * I will certainly purchase this again"

I've had such a hard time trying to grab enough product to evenly blend out. I've used my fingers, foundation brush, flat foundation brush, beauty blender, etc. now it just feels like the foundation is dried out and pretty useless at this point. * would think shade range wouldn't be an issue anymore with any brand. they either don't go dark enough or don't go light enough. or if they do, they only offer 1 undertone which doesn't work either. * I love Milano but this was a no for me. * I will start by saying that I bought this as a dupe for KVD's Good Apple, which is my gold-star foundation but whose price tag can be kinda ouch. As a dupe for KVD, this texture is beautiful and I absolutely loved the product during the summer months, when I had a bit more color. Now, to be fair, I am a VERY LIGHT lady (we're talking typically the first two or three shades of any major foundation line) and oooof even the lightest shade here was ORANGE. I am legitimately colorblind (red-green) and even I knew that this wasn't a good match. Unfortunately, there's not a lighter match. This product oxidizes rapidly and can get a bit flaky after three or four hours. Definitely be sure to properly prep your skin (I suggest skipping the silicone primers) before use! If you are lucky enough to fall in this very limited shade range, give it a go! Milani, pretty please make more shades?! I mean, I'm super duper white and cannot find my shade. Please don't forget about all the BIPOC baddies out there who could also use some serious representation in this line!! 12 shades only? Are you for real?!! * looks so pretty even on my trouble area on my nose. so many complexion products look so patchy and cakey on my nose but this is gorgeous. the finish is so smooth and the coverage is medium but buildable. I have normal skin and it doesn't get greasy or cakey. * I don't usually wear concealer or anything on my face, and this foundation makes it seem like you're not even wearing anything! I absolutely love it. Gives your face a nice, natural glow."

But this works for me.beautiful finish! * I think a lot of ppl dont think anout this brand a lot bc its not ""trending"". But its such a great TM. It makes my skin look better. It doesnt look like i have a layer of cake on. It evens out my complexion, adding a glow but nothing like a tin man-ish.  This is def an over looked product. It wears for hours wo looking patchy, separated. I cant say enough great things about this! * Blends away to basically no coverage but a lite orange dewy tint. * I don't understand why this doesn't get more buzz than it does. I've been using for 1.5 yrs, have been influenced to try 2 others in that time, and immediately go back to Halo. I do have to mix two neutral shades to get my summer color but that's typical for me. It stays put all day, doesn't settle into my wrinkles or pores, plays well with my other makeup, looks natural, has just the right amount of glow. I do wear a moisturizer under this bc my skin is very dry. I use this as my foundation year-around. Smashbox, please don't stop making this!!! * PROS:

‚Ä¢Blends in so easily.
‚Ä¢Stays put all day.
‚Ä¢Looks amazing on mature skin.
‚Ä¢Minimizes my fine lines
‚Ä¢Dewy & moisturized complexion 
‚Ä¢SPF 25
‚Ä¢Great color match 

My skin has blotchy red spots, but this Halo tint smooths out my skin tone so beautifully. I also have some fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead, but the tint doesn't settle into them. In fact, I'd say the product actually minimizes the appearance of my lines. My skin looks so dewy throughout the day. I really love this product and I hope it stays around forever! * This hands down is my summer go to tinted moisturizer. Sometimes I add a pump of foundation into it if I'm looking for a little bit more coverage. Keeps my skin hydrated. Gives the look like I'm not wearing makeup but just have a beautiful even skin tone. I wear this and a little bit of eyebrow pencil and I'm good. Like I said if I need more coverage I add a pump or two of foundation, which mixes well with all foundations. I like that there is some sunblock in it for days it's not super hot I don't add sunblock under my makeup. I saw a lot of reviews saying it broke them out, I have not had that problem. I also wash my face every night and put on face oil, no problem. In the morning I usually use a light water cream moisturizer. Highly recommend! I have middle-aged skin with discoloration no texture or wrinkles but I do have bigger pores. I continually purchase and stock up when it's on sale 10 out of 10. * I first bought the smaller size to get a better color match and to see if I liked the coverage. Great product with great coverage it has replaced my foundation."

It is also transfer resistant. It does not get on my hands throughout the day, and it does not wear off until I wash it off at the end of the night!!! my only complaint is, it is hard to find my shade. It is either too cool or too warm, so I am in the process of blending 2 to make a shade I like. * I have never written a review before, but this product is incredible. I have oily, acne prone skin and this stays on ALL day. I used this with nyx plump right back primer and my makeup lasted perfectly through a concert that was maybe 105 degrees inside (it was 96 degrees outside and it felt cold after) and i was sweating more than I ever have in my entire life and my makeup looked like it did when i first applied it literally 12 hours prior. I have gone through 5 bottles of this and the only con is every single bottle had a pump that barely works, but the foundation itself is just too good for me to care. * I love this foundation so much! I woulf best describe my skin as weird, im sensitive to a lot of products, and go through dry and oily phases. Im also pale with pink undertones and ALWAYS struggle to find the right foundation shade that isnt too yellow and this is the one (shade F3)! Its fuller coverage, i mix it with moisturizer or sunscreen when i want less coverage because i like the shade match so much. * Covers well and gives a nice dewy complexion * If you want full coverage with just one pump.This is the foundation for you.Light weight not heavy.I will buy this product again. * This foundation is not for mature skin.  Completely dries out the skin and causes dry patches.  It covers well initially, but collects in creases and fine lines.  Foundation comes on MUCH lighter than expected. * For the price this is a nice foundation. I have oily skin and i do have to blot my face throughout the day but i also have to do it with my expensive foundation. Does well on a 95 degree day"
140,140,140,140,juvia's place,i am magic glow radiance booster,pimprod2044250,2620803," * the coverage on this is amazing you can wear on it's own and leaves a beautiful glow but if you have oily skin like me i don't recommend, you'll look a mess lol * I had extremely high hopes for this product. I read all the reviews watched the YouTube videos and was ready to go.  First I tried the shade Punta Cana (5) and it was too dark. Then I went back and got the shady Giza (6) and it was too late, so I decided to mix both of them together, hoping it would balance out. I don't understand how a product can have so much pigment but no coverage if that makes sense.  The product is highly pigmented and when you put it on, you can clearly see there's makeup on your face however, I have a few blemishesthat it provided coverage 0 coverage for.  It didn't matter how much product I went back and dabbed on the blemishes still no coverage. I even let it sit and dry down hoping that would thicken it up but still no coverage.  Also, it was not glowing or dewy for me. I looked straight up Greasy, even with just the first layer, I looked sweaty like I had been out in the sun. It was not a flattering look. I even tried powdering it down, but it just looked greasy with powder on top which basically turned cakey and even with all that I could still see my blemishes through.  I purchased this this evening and I will be returning it immediately when the store opens tomorrow.  I love Juvia's Places' products and I will still continue to support and purchase, but this just didn't work for me.  Buyer beware. * I tried this thanks to a friend who has it and gave me a 'sample' (thank you, girlfriend!).  I must say, yes, it's better than the ones by e.l.f. and Charlotte Tilbury.  You can use it alone for a subtle glow and coverage, or mixed with your foundation (for the same effect).  Looks great either way.  I'm planning on getting a bottle for myself.  I do recommend it. * Elf Halo Glow broke me out and I never was able to try the Flawless Filter by CT but I dont think I need to because I discovered this and I LOVEEEE it. Perfect under foundation or just by itself. Gives me a perfect glow without making me look greasy * I bought this to try out since I couldnt justify spending $$ on charlotte tilbury. I love this formula & finish!! I couldve color matched better if I bought in person vs online, but the shade i got still works for my dry skin. Defintely going to be using this during Summer * From the color to the way it applies and blends, it's the best thing I've experienced in a while and I will be getting more shades. This may just be the product that will be my foundation, concealer and contour! * I like it a lot. I use it over my foundation to add glow. Awesome stuff!"

Color match was great and does not oxidize, but that's where the pros ended for me. Definitely not full coverage, didn't blend well and shifts/splotchy. If you're an oilslick like me‚Ä¶ this is a total waste. Maybe good for dryer skin? Going back to Dior at this price point and won't be purchasing this one again. * This foundation brought out texture and wrinkles I have never seen before. It is not very blend-able, as it takes a lot of manipulation to look somewhat acceptable. This product is very drying and I have oily skin. Not to mention it does not adhere to the skin, it slips and sides off your face throughout the day leaving you patchy. * I finally found my holy grail foundation, I didn't even buy it at Ulta but that's how much I loved it to write a review. It feels like I'm wearing nothing, it matches my skin perfectly which has been a nightmare for years trying to find a good match. * This coverage is a lot more sheer and dewy than I had anticipated. This would be a beautiful foundation for someone with dry, mature skin since it does not crease. The colors are not accurate either. I suggest ordering one to two shades darker. * I need to keep looking. I have a full bottle that I hope to find someone that it works for. * I was so disappointed in this product because I had been saving to buy it for such a long time and when I used it, it melted off and had to use a lot of setting powder to keep it in place somewhat!!

I am a make junkie and I had many foundations from drugstores and major department stores but as I got older they all made me look cake and settled into lines. I stumbled on this product and I love it. It's my skin only better. It lasts almost all day on my  combination oily dry skin. It is a wonderful product with light medium coverage for mature skin. Will definitely buy again * I've used 3 pots of this now and I'm still somehow surprised by how nice it is. The formula feels like it won't cover much, but it softens the appearance of/seems to fill and even out pores, scars, wrinkles, or any textures--I often get compliments on how smooth my skin looks when I use this. I've gone back and forth between two colors because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the color match is a little difficult. All in all, I keep trying new foundations just to come back to this one and be impressed by it. * I'm a light-medium skin tone that leans towards cool. I got started on this because an influencer raved about it a few yrs. ago. I decided to try it and couldn't had been more thrilled. I use shade fair 20 for reference. In the pot it looks more like a peach shade. It glides on effortlessly and melts into my skin. My dry/mature skin looks healthy. I'm sure I will get tired of this foundation, but for the last 3 yrs. I've been pleased. Only time will tell. * I was very skeptical to try this and was shocked. It is so good. 47 year old combo skin, apply with real techniques dense brush and its better than high end. How is this not more popular? * I have never really worn foundation, I have tried occasionally but it just isn't me. I bought this on a whim since it is different than traditional foundation. My face gets a little shiny after applying sunscreen, which is never good. I apply this with a foundation brush around my eyes and the sides of my nose. It hides the shine and evens the skin tone while still looking natural. * I really liked this foundation except that the fairest shade was very orange on me, even with my summer tan. * I love this balm. It's perfect for anyone who doesn't like the heavy or sticky feel of foundation, wants a natural look with light coverage.

I actually found it quite drying. I love HG products and am so glad Ulta is carrying them. I hope they'll carry the newer HG skin tint so I can try that one. * Im 55 and my skin is very dry, this product is moisturizing and never settles in my pores , an excellent alternative to foundation which just sat on my skin, this tinted moisturizer does not do that. I would highly recommend this product- * I have never had so many compliments about my skin since using this tinted moisturizer! It may not be for anyone needing full coverage makeup but someone looking for a glow and slight coverage! * It was very hard to find something for my aging skin that is full coverage, but doesn't settle into lines and look caked on. this was recommended in store and I absolutely love it! I apply with a beauty blender and use shape tape concealer with a tiny bit of setting powder. Really makes a difference being hyaluronic and any pictures while wearing come out great. A must in my drawer. * I wanted to like this. I have dry skin and some creepiness at 52. This made all of that worse.

It's very thick and kinda hard to blend out even with moisturizer and primer. 
I had to return this and buy the Too Faced brand hydrating liquid foundation. * Several comments said this was medium to full coverage which made me want to try it and it is not. There is absolutely no coverage at all. If anything it's just a glorified moisturizer so I'm thinking those other comments were for a different product. * Absolutely one of my favorite foundation.

My JI mineral foundation stores securely,  the compact opens easily and now has a mirror. Yay! * I am a loyal Jane Iredale brand user. In fact, I have been using their products for over 20 years. The Jane Iredale line was recommended to me by the surgeon who did facial reconstruction after skin cancer surgery. 

Although I love their products, I have always been ""ehh"" about their packaging....until now! Thanks for finally giving up the gaudy gold (sorry, Jane Iredale) and going with this new, modern and aesthetically pleasing line of packaging. Since I have several of the old gold compacts, including the gold metals ones, I ordered one of the new compacts to see how I would like it. After receiving the new compact, I cannot wait to replace ALL my older versions! 

One more suggestion... in your future development, please consider making your eye shadows available in refills. I love the idea of being kinder to our planet and saving on the excess packaging. I do not mind paying separately for the cases if I know if is making a smaller, greener impact for future generations. =)

One final note of thanks to Ulta...I have been begging my local store to start carrying Jane Iredale. I am glad to see that you are at least finally carrying this amazing, clean line of makeup online! * I bought this on sale and I'm glad I did. It just makes it nice to put your foundation in. For the price of the foundation, it's a shame you have to purchase compact separately. * This packaging is overpriced and by default should be included with the powder. Waste of money."

It is more like a skin tint than a foundation, which I prefer if I do ever wear it, the smell is relaxing (if you're not an essential oil person I wouldn't recommend, the lavender is pretty strong), and it doesn't feel like anything is on. For my Florida girls this stuff is a great quick fix for the hot and humid days!! * I have super sensitive, rosacea-prone skin & my eyes are really easily irritated by makeup (ocular rosace) that started a few years ago - suddenly I couldn't wear my favorite makeup without breaking out, & my eyes burning, bright red. I searched & finally found a brand specifically for rosacea-prone skin! So happy to be able to wear makeup again! Over the last year or so the formula clearly changed - I couldn't find a color match & then my eyes started to  burn again. Back to the search - finally found this - I love this foundation & the whole product line! It's light & looks great - as others have said, I look like myself, only better! It doesn't settle in my lines or pores, doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It does feel a bit oily / has a bit of shine. Also, Nude 3 is a perfect color match for me when it goes on, but it does darken a bit across the day so I'm going to try 2.5 & save 3 for the summer. Otherwise, highly recommend!! * I bought this foundation and love it.  I'm 47 years old with dry and pigmented skin from aging and I like light coverage products due to aging skin look more natural than full coverage foundation.  Very moisturizing.

I have very sensitive skin and no problems. I have been using this for years now and I am very happy with it. It goes on smooth and it buildable to a good medium coverage. * This was my first time trying this make up brand and I a now a fan! Makeup is lightweight and comfortable to the skin. Is  100% true to skin match and buildable coverage, and also holds well in heat! * Run run RUN to get this foundation!!! I cant say enough good things about it! It gives such a radiant, skin like finish and doesnt feel heavy or greasy. Plus, the shades come in differnt formulas, depending on the shade range!!! * This is my 4th time buying this foundation and they changed the formula! It has a watery, runny consistency, whereas before it was a thicker consistency. The new formula still works just as well as the old one! Coverage is buildable without looking cakey (just make sure to blend with a damp sponge). I have rosacea and red acne marks & it covers flawlessly and still looks like my skin. 

I also have combo skin. I find this foundation to hydrate and also not accentuate my oils that i produce throughout the day. It's a perfect soft matte finish. * I get compliments whenever I wear this. it's a really good, light on the skin, natural finish foundation, but somehow still manages to have good coverage. It's very easy to blend into the skin, and wears great across the day. My absolute favorite thing about it though is that it has the best shade range and undertone range I've experienced. I'm a pale olive which is very hard to find foundation for, but this looks amazing on me. * This foundation of the game changer, so long wearing I work 10 to 12 hour days and it does not budge crack or flake. This is a Serum foundation so it is very watery but the coverage is absolutely amazing. I have never seen a Foundation blur the way this does. I have been mixing this foundation with the Youthforia primer for light days this combo makes it into a radiant tinted moisturizer. * I really like this foundation. It is on the watery side and you have to work fast with it. However it is buildable with coverage. They have a great shade range and blends into the skin smoothly."
150,150,150,150,j.cat beauty,aquasurance compact foundation,pimprod2000221,2550026," * This is the best powder foundation i have ever tried, i reach for this one over my high end one. Its my go to during the summer months. * Medium to full coverage. I like to carry it in my bag for touch ups because it covers the redness around the nose, i can cover up some my blemishes that peak out after wearing makeup all day etc * I use the shade Natural and I absolutely love this powder. i've used mine all the way to the pan and just restocked a new one. Literally the most beautiful blurring coverage, doesn't feel cakey or drying and my skin looks flawless. Great for on the go and quick touch ups. I usually hate the feeling of wearing heavy foundations and powders so once I found this it was over. Super breathable and comfortable and evens out my skin tone in a couple quick pass overs. I love this product. * Medium to high coverage, smoothing, non-comedogenic. Its a bit hard to shade match. I use Soft Tan in this powder and Nars Valencia, Lisa Eldridge 19, Estee Lauder 4w1. * This was my favorite foundation for everyday wear until recently. It is the best color match I've found and so easy to use. However, as others have stated, my last two orders have fallen apart into unusable powder within a few uses. Super bummed. * I've used this for a couple of years always carrying one in my purse. My last 3 have broken easily. The last one within a week!
Otherwise I like the product itself but once it breaks it's harder to use, and inconvenient. * I love this powder foundation because it was acrually a full coverage foundation. I do have combo skin so my t zone would get oily, but not enough to stop using this. I even had 2 other friends try it, but the biggest issue me and my friends had which is why I will no longer get it is because it cracks so easily. My friend received hers broken, then me and mt orher friends wasn't broken at first then after a few uses when we openes oirs it compeltely crumbled and cracked and made a huge mess. Maybe the formula changed?"

This foundation seemed to cover the redness fine but it faded within about 2 hours of wear. It settled in my fine lines and looked, for lack of a better word, gritty. No fragrance but does have an unpleasant chemical smell. It's a no for me. (Not Revlon's fault but the color-finding function led me to 117 Light Beige, which was the right depth level but pulled warm on me.) * the most skinlike finish of any drugstore product I've ever found. it has good coverage, wears comfortably on the skin, and doesn't crease or transfer if you set and prep correctly. it feels like the $50-$70 foundations i used to wear and the price is unbeatable. 10/10 * What an incredible skin loving foundation. After 2 weeks of using I'm noticing a more even skin tone, my fine lines are disappearing, and my skin feels nourished. I love this for spring/ summer! I prefer it without primer as I notice I get the most benefit that way. I do set with a non-talc powder and Milani setting spray. It truly looks like skin if you get the right shade! * When set properly, this foundation lasts all day, looks like skin, and never cakes or clings to dry patches. It looks and feels expensive on the skin, and I'd pick this over my Lancome for coverage anyway. It can be a bit too dewy if you don't do proper skin prep, but with the right primer and setting powder, it's perfect üëå * This is an AMAZING foundation. The coverage is perfection. It's dewy, has great ingredients, and I absolutely love it on my very sensitive skin. I have been using this since it was introduced to the Revlon line and my hope is that this will never discontinue. ü§û I have used only high-end foundations in the past before trying this foundation and this one is a clear winner. üôåüèªü©∑üòª * One of the best drugstore foundations I've tried! Expect some shininess on your T-zone toward the end of the day if you have oily skin like me, but I was honestly impressed with how long this lasted on its own without any primer or setting powder. The finish is so perfectly radiant yet natural, no cakiness or patchiness at all (noticed a little creasing after several hours but it didn't bother me). You really can't beat the price either, I can't believe I used to spend $40+ on high end foundations that didn't even look this good. Will definitely purchase again! * I felt like for the price that this was a below average foundation.  I have used many""drug store"" foundations and  this was just a ""run of the mill"".  I use a good moisturizer and it is fone by noon.  I also feell like it does not have a great coverage.  You can definitely see many imperfections in my skin that other foundations normally cover.  I will not buy again. I did not return it because of how far I live from an Ulta store."

I actually really like it! Its light but still provides some coverage. Its nice for an everyday look. * The tint is not worth the money from my opinion. I love that it is a cruelty free and available at a drugstore price. But it peels no matter the skincare used or primer. It seats on top of the skin so it hard to blend. It does look natural and I have gotten compliments on it but its bot worth the work put for it to work. * Barely any coverage. I didn't expect it to have much and I didn't want a full coverage, just something to even everything out but it doesn't do that. Also literally comes off your face and patches up as your applying it. * I expected a light, sheer tint, and the coverage is very poor. It gobs up when you rub your face and doesn't stay in place. * I bought this, liked the sheet mask and overnight cream. The cleanser was ok. As time went on with the night cream I loved it more and more so I bought the full size. I also bought more sheet masks of this same type and later bought the serum. Great way to try sample sizes before committing to the larger size. * I used this product 4 different times, each time the product was separating from itself on my skin. First time I used primer before putting this on and it separated. Second time I mixed it with moisturizer and it separated. Third time I put the moisturizer on before the skin tint then it separated. Fourth time I tried it with a bare face, again, separating from itself. The last two times I used it I noticed it was separating where I have acne/texture on my skin. So basically if you have acne or texture don't use it."
154,154,154,154,revlon,illuminance serum tint,pimprod2042614,2618859," * I was worrying that it would be too light, but it's not * I was hoping this would be a dupe for the Urban Decay Hydromaniac skin tint, but it just isn't! This sits on top of the skin for me and clings to dry patches I didnt know I had. However, the color match is spot on! * When I hit 60 it became increasingly difficult to find a foundation or even a tinted moisturizer that worked for me.  I still have an oily T zone but the rest of my face is drier than it used to be. Foundations that were always my go to no longer worked (Bare Minerals, Estee Lauder Double Wear, etc..)  I knew I had to go with the ""less is more"" mindset.  I stumbled across this Revlon skin tint quite by accident but decided that for the price point it was worth a try.  What a find!  Very lightweight, good buildable coverage and lasts all day (with a little setting powder).  It is so breathable...feels like nothing on the skin. Finding the right shade may be a challenge but I went a bit darker than I usually do and Buff Beige works great on my fair skin. (I also realized that going too light as you get older makes you look very washed out).  I apply with a sponge but you could do it with fingers or a brush too.  It is my daily go to now.  If you are an older gal, give this a try! * Covers surprisingly good for a serum tint.  It is slightly sticky for a while on the skin, but if you have dry skin it might be ok, less so if it's  oily. * Not sure if its the same for anyone else but it made me break out really bad and i wanted to like it a lot :( * I love this! feels so hydrating and has a minimal coverage that conceals redness while still showing my freckles. It truly feels like skincare * I ised this for the first time yesterday. Used my fingers to dab it all aroind my face then used fingers to blend once it warmed up. It went on really nice for just using my hands. I wore it for about 7hrs. I did put some it! Poreless powder over. It wore really well! No caking, didnt settle in my lines. Im 44yo with normal to oily skin. The only thing ill do didferent next time is not use as much moisturizer. It appears this is hydrating. The coverage was light but buildable to medium. Will be my everyday go to."
155,155,155,155,covergirl,clean fresh skin milk foundation,pimprod2011577,2556836," * I rarely wear foundation, largely because I hate how heavy it feels on my face, and I also love my freckles and foundations tend to cover them. I bought this out of curiosity and I'm surprisingly happy with the result! It's a pretty watery consistency, but that means A) a little goes a long way, especially when applied with a foundation brush, and B) it feels so light on my face!! It evened out my skin tone (as someone with vitiligo, this is always a big win!!) without totally covering my freckles. It looks super natural, too. I appreciate the price for the amount of product and the fact that it has no scent. 

The one con for me is that my nose felt kind of greasy a few hours later‚Äîbut the rest of my face felt pretty dry, so that could just be my overactive pores LOL.

For reference, I am very pale (and I have vitiligo). I'm using shade 520- Fair. * It smelt soooo bad bro, i put it on twice, once to try and another to actually go out and then when i did it to go out it started peeling and looked SOOOOO cakey, like cakier than cakey. It smells TERRIBLE, when i was applying it i had to hurry since it smelt sooo bad, i can even explain fbe scent, but its just plain terrible, dont recommend * As I enter my mid-twenties, I've transitioned from the thick, full-coverage foundations of my adolescence to more lightweight and natural finishes. I bought this with the hopes of it being a bit more full coverage than a regular tinted moisturizer.

The color match is great, no quarrels there. It is also a great base for makeup and blends very smoothly with a beauty blender. I am, however, disappointed in the coverage. It is a very sheer foundation - it mostly just does color correction and levels out skin color. It does not do much for acne scars or dark circles. Also make sure to exfoliate and moisturize, as this will cling to dry patches. It also seems to fade a bit throughout the day.

Overall, it's a decent tinted moisturizer. Look elsewhere for lightweight with coverage. * Both my teens use this and love it. Provides a good light coverage without to much of a makeup look. * The sheerest tinted moisturizer i have. On good rosacea days i can wear this over light concealer. It feels lightweight because it is super runny. * I have been on a journey to find the perfect foundation for my oily, early 30s, very pale skin. 
Something light coverage, that just evens out my skintone and dulls the redness. A light layer that easily applies over sunscreen, that will last all day. I'm so happy I finally found this product! 
It checks all of my boxes and then some!
Very natural looking finish, goes on easily, and I don't have to spend an eternity blending. I was able to achieve a great look with just my fingers.
They nailed the tone for us pale folks too, no orange at all!
Be aware this has VERY light coverage, I can actually still see my freckles through it. I absolutely love that, but if you are looking to hide anything, this probably won't do it for you. 
It has an accurate name because it comes out of the bottle just like milk. I actually made a mess on my counter applying it the first time because I wasn't expecting such a watery consistency, you've been warned!
It feels very nourishing and weightless, almost like moisturizer. The only con I can think of is I wish the bottle was bigger.

Overall an affordable, light coverage foundation that feels like you aren't even wearing it. * I got the shade medium and it was ok, it looked a bit orange on me but I also noticed it clumped up. I had to really break up the clumps. Wouldn't repurchase a better shade."
156,156,156,156,covergirl,trublend matte made liquid foundation,pimprod2000386,2533518," * I use the foundation daily and I would definitely recommend to someone who's on a tight budget. only thing is it is easily transferable and doesn't stay on variable. It also looks a bit cakey but i highly recomend spraying do we setting spray onto your brush/sponge, and then blending out. * I normally wear Estee stay matte foundation but I was out and until it arrived I needed something in the meantime. I wore this out, was standing in the parking lot talking to my friends and some random lady walked up to us and said ""sorry to interupt but I just have to tell you, you are stunning"" ( she was talking to me) And then she walked off. I was never told that when I wore the Estee! What the heck, this stuff is GOLD. * I have been using this foundation for 5 years now. I will say it is not full coverage but it is buildable. This foundation feels so lightweight & it gives such a natural look. I've tried other foundations but always come back to this one cause its just so good! I tend to have an oily T-zone & everywhere else is pretty much dry but this foundation doesn't ever really cake or flake on me. I 100% recommend this foundation for an everyday natural look! * I love this foundation! it's affordable and stays on all throughout the work day * this foundation is surprisingly good for the price. it's buildable, smooth, and has a nice matte but natural finish. it flaked on my chin area after a few hours, but that could be my skin type. * Love this for my combo skin. I'm not extremely oily but I needed something that would actually last throughout the day without needing to powder by midday. I actually like it better than the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I am shade 090 in Lancome but have not been able to find a good color match as 090 is too light and the next shades are too dark and orange. I have very fair neutral skin. I prefer how the covergirl looks, it is very smooth with slightly better coverage, and L20 is a great shade and a closer match than the Lancome (maybe L20 is a dash too light but it looks perfect after bronzer). It gives a natural matte finish that doesn't cling or look cakey. Works well on my middle-age skin with fine lines. Has great medium-full coverage. Highly recommend! * I really love this foundation and I will continue to purchase it! Affordable and covers well."

It made me very patchy, and it was very hard to match a shade. It also dried decently fast, so if you didnt blend immediately, it was going to stay where you placed it. Spend a little bit more for a better product. * Its bad for acne/pores/oily skin.

It's full coverage, lasts throughout the day even without setting spray and has really nice coverage. If I ever found a dupe to my Mac foundation this warm shell essence foundation is definitely it!! * Oh my gosh!!! This product has been so amazing on my skin!! It blends so well.

Then it was impossible to blend out on my face and ruined my makeup ): * I love this powder this is the best powder that I have discovered as of lately. Elf kills it with all the products they release but this is top tier. * I really wanted to like this product, but even though I moisturize my skin, it leaves randow streaks on my face, as if i applied it with a paint brush. And leaves weird marks on my nose that I cant blend out and have to literally use my nails to scratch off. I have oily skin and never experienced this with a powder foundation. * I have fair skin and got the recommended color. It's too yellow for me and honestly isn't as good as the dermablend camo. I only got it because I can't find the dermablend camo anywhere. This doesn't stay on my skin very well and rubs off so easily. * I am 39 years old, and I have struggled to find a powder foundation that would work for my combo skin, I have spent tons of money, looked high and low, and have never been happy with anything that I found in the past. I could not believe how well, this held up for me! I am 39 years old and I had a baby nine months ago and don't have much time to do my make up but I still wanna look half decent when I have to go out of the house and this is quick and easy and effortless, I highly recommend this to anybody who cannot seem to find a powder foundation that works for them, maybe you might meet your match with this one. I do use the little sponge that comes with the powder because it works for me and I don't want to try to mess withthe system lol. * If your ever going for a simple quick look thsi is the foundation powder to use, the shade match is incredible accurate,decent coverage for a sinple quick look. I definitely recommend!! * I really love this product. The shade range is REALLY good for a powder foundation. I am extremely fair, and the lightest shade matches me perfectly. Its very rare a brand or product will have a shade light enough for me, SO I WAS STOKED!!

Pros : High coverage. Can be used alone or overtop liquid foundation for even more coverage.

Cons : I only have one con. I have dry sensative acne-prone skin. I am NOT oily at all, but at the end of the day after wearing this powder I do look oily. I would say this is NOT FOR OILY SKIN! But great for dry / combo skin!

Overall I love this product and I use it almost daily. Great price, great product"

Its SO THICK in texture and sits right on top of my pores, accentuating them while it refuses to blend. Its so greasy i cant even wash it off my hands unless i use dish soap. Despite having the texture of oil paint, somehow the coverage is also fairly sheer??? How!! The only positive thing i can say is that it was cheap. * Have purchased this foundation twice already & always gets compliments on it! Super full coverage and buildable! Have yet to find my right shade but just mix it with other ones, so no complaints really. Would reccomend if you have oily skin. * I usually get the Fair to Medium Light! It doesn't take much and it lasts all day! * Wrong shade.  Salespeople were not at all helpful - Stock very low. * This Foundation is thick and applies good coverage but it stinks really bad like almost like it's made with cow manure or something. Please fix this ulta. * I did not like the color on my skin * This is by far THE most full coverage foundation you can buy.  Hands down, no joke!  It is super thick and creamy and you must work quickly to spread it on your face when applying.  It is best applied directly to the skin with your fingers, smoothed out that way, then pressed in with a puff - not a sponge and not a brush!  Moisturize very well before application too.  If you want a thinner application, thin it out with moisturizer, then apply it, but still be prepared to still be dazzled.  It will give you the most beautiful, gorgeous finish of any foundation you will ever use!"

You dont have to use a lot and literally your face is flawless. One of the things i love about this product is it doesnt dry out your skin. I got the shade neutral 25 and id say that its a mix of fair and tan. I also really love the application part of it, the wand is really nice!!! * Covers a lot without having to apply a ton. Love the application wand * I love this foundation I find myself reaching for it more  often than the others. it's not drying, not greasy,  the coverage looks like my skin but glowy, and not cakey. The kiko Milano powder is awesome too for baking BTW. This foundation is way very similar to TF Born this way foundation, (but not as greasy) kiko milano is underrated IMO. Yes I would recommend. * Good color and application, but really accentuates wrinkles. * I'm a fair to light olive undertone. I bought 2 shades, WB15 and WB25. WB25 was away too dark. I thought WB15 would match until I went in the sun it was Soo orange. disappointed. formula is good and coverage is great, just wish I can find a shade. * I like how this felt and it looked great.  Then i touched my face and prints! then this was be a matte look. I was shiny as all get out. Too much for something I would not let anyone else borrow * I wish the lightest shade was a bit lighter but is wearable.  Feels kind of heavy, you definitely feel like you're wearing foundation if not used sparingly.  Now for the good, makes a wonderful concealer, last all day and does not budge or break down.  If being used as a full face foundation, less is more with this, one drop blends out beautifully and covers up exactly what you need to cover...  Covers like a high-end concealer, last all day like a high-end foundation should last,  Definitely worth the spend..."
164,164,164,164,well people,bio stick foundation,pimprod2008575,2553269," * I have very fair and pink skin and have always had trouble finding foundations that match my tone, never mind work well on my oily/combination skin, but I will say that this one does a good job! I was nervous buying online without match testing, but I got the 1C and would say its a pretty good match for my skin tone. 

My pros for this are definitely: generaly matches my skin, works well with my oily/combination skin, it coming in a stick format is very convenient and mess free, stays on very well, looks natural, and doesnt make my skin feel gross

My cons would be: not the perfect match (wish the undertones were more p and that the shade was slightly lighter), can get a little cakey if i put too much on, and a little hard to blend. 

For context I've been wearing Too Faced Born this way foundation in the shade Snow for years now because it's the only foundation I've found that comes close to matching my skin, but I've always run into the same problem of not being able to apply the foundation too thick because then you can tell it's not a true match. Anyway, I would say overall thi one does a better job, has better ingredients, feels better on my skin, and is a good price point.

My last points would be dont let the 1 star reviews scare you, this foundation is very nice and as long as you use a wet sponge to apply and don't mind the mild scent of castor oil that fades in about 30 minutes :) * The old formula was amazing.  Shade 1C was a perfect cool tone as described.  This newer version is very peach in tone and no longer qualifies as cool toned.  So  if you are a fair, cool toned person...look elsewhere. * I have come back to this product again and again after trying other hydrating foundations that are too thin and messy or settle into pores. This is my favorite non-SPF foundation. It is like a natural version of cover girl compact makeup. It's vegetable oil based so it does smell like olive oil. But it's so nourishing and convenient with the solid stick. It smooths on well to a medium coverage and natural dewy finish that doesn't settle into my pores or cause breakouts for me. And with a light powder to set, it stays all day. I do wish they had lighter shades as the lightest warm (2W) is a bit dark for me in winter. But I'm a repeat customer of this good clean dry skin foundation option. * This brand is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I live in the desert and ingredients like hyaluronic acid just pull the water out of your skin because there's no water in the air here. It seemed like every make up and skincare brand hopped on that train and I couldn't find anything for my skin (dry) and climate type. I hope they never change the formula! I'm almost 30 and I'm starting to get crows ft etc and this really does a great job of camouflage without settling in any wrinkles. * I wanted a clean foundation and chose this one. I bought 1C. It is darker than my skin and yellower. But who doesn't love a tan? I am hoping for a few shades added. It applies easily and blends well with other products. It hasn't caked or chalked much. It has a very lightweight coverage. The smell is a bit castor oil but better than heavy perfume scents on the face. I did not realize Elf makes this. I would not have purchsed it since Elf products irritate my skin. I have not tried it on my eyelids. This seems fine so far. All in all, I am undecided on repurchase but this is not a bad product. * This is far and away the worst make up product I have ever purchased.  Covergirl compact foundation with the little sponge from the 90's was better. It had that smell like Halloween makeup, and it was 3 shades too dark. Clearly something defective about it.  I purchased the powder foundation in the same shade and it was defective in the other direction, super light.  Run away from this! * I randomly decided to try a stick foundation, and man I'm happy I purchased this one! The amount looks small, but I'm telling you‚Ä¶ this goes such a long way! I got so many compliments at a wedding for having beautiful glowing skin. I totally attribute it to this foundation! It is easy to use too much ‚Äî it'll feel like cake face if you do. Start small, then build! I applied straight to my face then bugged out with a brush."

I received it at the same time another package with the new Prada foundation came in, and I'm shocked that i like the Lorac foundation more than the Prada!  I applied this with my Hourglass foundation brush as the formula is quite thin amd it went on beautifully. Its so smooth and the finish really is a soft matte. It seems to be very long lasting as well. My first favorite foundation of the year. * I finally got my hands on this foundation and I wore it and loved it right away! I will say if you're sensitive to smells it does smell like paint but it will fade. This foundations lasts all day and blurred my acne scared skin & pores. obsessed! * Lorac left no choice but to select this when they quit making the PoreFection foundation.  This has no sunscreen and it has an odor similar to molasses. I use it because it doesn't break my face out. * I love it one of the reasons I love it is because it doesn't crease and settle in my  lines and it's very very hard to find products they don't do that.

And it is in my opinion‚Ä¶  To apply it I use a beauty blender and it goes on amazing and for me honestly a little bit goes a long way. ‚Ä¶ I have large pores texturize skin, but yet this one seems to work good for me and not feel too heavy.‚Ä¶ I wouldn't say it's totally water resistant, but good enough because let me tell you I've cried while having it on and it does not streak not at all at least not for me and like I said,  I'm almost 46 years old. I'm a 45 year old woman so it's been a struggle for me and I know other people have been saying a lot of different things then I am saying, but I know for me personally it is one of my favorites and always will be! And I highly recommend for more mature skin‚Ä¶ I really really do ‚Ä¶ I have used a brush with it before and it does work good as well. Not a matte either. Just a beautiful natural finish not too dewy. Put it to you this way whenever I use the Lorac foundation, I always get compliments oh, and before I forget, it does not crease on my eyelids, and that is one of my biggest pet peeves ever üòÇ. * Since the perfection foundation was discontinued I thought this pro version would somehow be better. It is not. It is very heavy coverage and cakes on. It truely smells like maple syrup. Laura Mercier makes a tinted moisturizer w SPF that is more like porefection formerly by Lorac. * I HATE this foundation.  I used the lorac sheer porefection foundation foe years. when it was discontinued I was upset but thought I would give this new product a try.  I used a primer under. I used an applicator sponge. it is terrible. it is thick. I was hoping this would equate to better coverage.  no such luck. it settles into pores and fine lines. it looks chalky on the skin. it transfers easily. I HATE this foundation.  üòí * This foundation looks beautiful on the skin. Not cakey & doesn't cling to lines and pores. one of my top foundations!"

It's the old school sort--the kind that feels very waxy.  If you have dry skin, you will not be pleased.  It's very hard to get the finish to look good, and even harder to get it to stay looking good.  It's probably not going to save you time or make your life easier on the go. * I am blown away by how amazing this stick foundation is!! It gives a barely there feeling which i love. It does not settle into fine lines and stays on all day. Can't wait to try more stuff from the brand!!! * This stick goes on sooo smoothly! Absolutely love the consistency of this makeup! My skin looked like a barely there makeup look, exactly what i was going for. Definitely need to extend the shade range of this makeup but other than that this stuff is amazing!! * great coverage for my skin tone and felt smooth.  please add more skin tones so all people can have it. * this shade range has every type of tone for lighter skin but for 1 dark complexion do better * I honestly dont unserstand why people who've never tried this give it a low rating due to the shade range. This is an Italian owned brand. Majority of the population is olive, light to medium skintones. Many of them/us have a hard time finding our shades. Go try Fenty Beauty if you dont like it. Anyways, this is fantastic. Super blendable and looks smooth on my texture. * the shade range is disgusting. its not like italy is a sheltered country or anything, many POC reside there. darker women, men, and all in between deserve to have products that fit their skin too. do better."

Wipes off easily and blends with nothing. Won't purchase again! * I have combination skin, super oily with dry patches. I hate the feeling of foundation so I just prefer something super light to even out my color and mattify me. This stuff is perfect! It feels completely weightless and looks natural. It wears off gradually by the end of the day without looking crazy. Definitely my favorite face makeup! * It wiped off easily didn't  stay on my face. I would use it in a certain spot and i would try and apply it somewhere else and it would wipe off * As for color match, it's perfect. But it doesn't really cover up my imperfections like age spots * Looks great on my skin. * Very light coverage. Feels so light and soft on skin. Not oily after a full day of wear! Doesn't cover blemishes the best but will give a nice even tone over the skin. Blends nicely! * I loved this! Its very light weight. I used under this my normal skin car rountine. And i wear elf glow sunscreen and halo glow with this bb cream and i loved the result. I do use conceler as well. And i dont feel caked on. Honestly try this method."

This one is up there with the more high end serum foundations in every way but without the crazy price tag. It is sheer - exactly what I like! - and blends like a dream. It has staying power and flattering shades. A little goes a long way. It plays well with other products both cream and powder. No moisturizer needed as it is very hydrating - my dry mature skin drinks this up and loves it! Very happy! * I've got combination skin with an oily t-zone and dry on my forehead and underneath my eyes, this doesn't bring any of this texture out! It's light coverage which I like for daily wear and for hot days. * It's so light! Def what I was looking for. Just a psa to anyone who wants to buy this, I'd suggest buying at AT THE store because I ordered it and received it with the product spilled. Still product in the bottle, but I for some reason can't put it sideways or it leaks. So if you order it online, be aware either the bottle is just awful or it broke while it was shipping to me. 
Other than that it's a wonderful product * I have used way too many foundations from luxury to drug store and this is by far the one I always want to reach for and have a back up. I have to force myself to use other foundations. I have normal to dry skin with some hyperpigmentation and prefer light coverage foundations that looks like skin. I use a smoothing primer in my pore areas, do two pumps with a drop of oil, dab it onto my skin and blend with a brush and this always makes my skin look absolutely flawless. No caking around my nose or forehead areas. Throughout the day, it continues to melt into my skin and look better and better. I can imagine this wouldnt be ideal with those with oily skin or who want more coverage, but for me this is the gold standard and what I put all of my other foundations/skin tints against. * I think you would have to have perfect skin to like this. Absolutely no coverage. Your face just looks wet. * My makeup aesthetic goals are ""awake, and not languishing away from consumption"", and this foundation is great for that. Sheer, doesn't settle into fine lines, leaves my skin smooth and hydrated and flawless. Add a quick dab of blush and mascara and boom, people stop asking me if I've been ill."

It is so thick it won't pump out. The foundation is clumpy and doesn't spread at all. Why did they change a good product???? * This foundation is worth trying! Creamy, spreads nicely (I use a brush), nice colour matching (I consider myself a medium brown skin colour). Overall great product! * I cannot say enough GOOD THINGS about this CC cream. There comes the point when foundation is out, and CC cream is in, and I am pleased with this product's color choices, smooth texture, and luminescence. I mix two shades and apply the first color as a primer. This CC cream doubles as my concealer; it's that easy to apply. * This product: separates BADLY and doe not blend well at all; Smells weird and chemical-y; offers VERY little coverage, even for a CC cream, and is overpriced because of all these factors. Positives: it makes skin glowy and has SPF. I wouldn't buy this personally - Pacifica's skincare and fragrance are AMAZING, but makeup seems to be a weak point. * This product came out separated. Tried shaking product to get product mixed together and it came out somewhat like foundation. Does not go on skin nicely. Do not recommend. * it comes out as a clear oil with little specs of color that don't blend."

This breathable, light satin finish can be set up on itself until youve found your inner teenage beauty queen! It's perfect for my skin type & it smells lovely too. A+ Ulta! * I love this lightweight easy to apply buildable foundation.  And so easy to match my complexion. * it appears that this foundation is being discontinued & I'm so upset. i have 51 y.o. mature, incredibly dry skin. this foundation is so wonderful & I have never found anything comparable. i need this in my makeup arsenal!!! * Please don't discontinue this item! It's the only foundation that works for my mature skin. It goes on so nice and smooth and cover just enough. Please please PLEASE bring back some of the lighter colors. * I bought this over the holidays and LOVED it!! Goes on easily and is weightless. Soooo disappointed to see that my shade is not available. Please do not discontinue this product. * My perfect shade is Light to Medium Cool.  Not available the last 2 times I've tried to buy.  What's up with that.  Not everybody needs a dark shade.  I would venture to say there are more who want lighter shades. Love the silky formula!"

I show this to the older women in my family and you would think I was literally doing a magic trick lol shock awe and wonder. I often and loudly recommend this in True Caramel. Perfect for lace on wigs or just on skin * The foundation is very smooth and moisturizing.  It provides medium coverage, so I build it by applying several applications to get a more full coverage.  It is a great product for the price. * I have purchased this product before and I liked it. This time the product was used. It had a finger smudge print on it when l opened it and the sponge applicator had make all on one side. I ended up purchasing something else at another store. * First, note this has the ingredients that Danessa Myricks uses for her foundation at an affordable cost. This provides a great shade match, makes skin look healthy and even, easy to take with you and stays on even if you sweat. The magnesium carbonate in the formula absolutely is wonderful for sweaty moments. I just find you can't really apply it with anything other than a sponge. Brushes with dense round tops don't pick it up well, as nothing else does. If you don't want to buy a beauty sponge you'll be fine to use the one it comes with. * Great shade for Hispanic women. * Too dark/matched my hand-too dark for my face * My mom loves this foundation and looks forward to trying more products from the line"
176,176,176,176,essence,keep me covered powder,pimprod2043728,2618266," * Got this on a whim since it was affordable. I needed a pressed powder to add to my collection since my favorite loose powder is from wet n wild (the banana brightening one). But this looks fine on around the face but TERRIBLE under the eyes. I dont want to return so i will use it around the face and avoid the undereyes. * Got this hoping to use as a brightening powder after setting. It looks horrible under the eye and emphasizes texture and dryness I never noticed before. I've tried using it on it's own with a powder puff or as a finishing powder with a small brush to brighten. Never had this problem with other powders. I'm 18 but I have oily, slightly textured skin and fine lines under my eyes. Even on other parts of my face I find it difficult to blend. I would return this but it works surprisingly well as eyeshadow (when paired with other eyeshadows). I'm assuming makeup returns get trashed. My favorite powders are the Maybelline Fit Me (loose and pressed). I'm trying to find vegan/cruelty free alternatives and so far the Nyx Can't Stop Won't Stop has been my closet find to the Fit Me pressed powder. This is nothing like the Fit Me pressed powder. * I purchase this as a setting powder and although I like it; it was the wrong shade. * Was so happy to try this and received it broken in the mail. Dissapointing. * It totally didn't work out for me:( It made my makeup look patchy. * The color was quite ""white"" on my face as a finishing powder."

Try if you are on the fence. Con- It may transfer * I used it for coverage and even my tone. * Good coverage & pairs well with all my concealers. I prefer using this foundation with a brush.

Maybe try tinted moisturizer * Light and hydrating product that evens out dull skin without looking heavy! Great for looking put together on minimal makeup days. * The coverage of this bad boy is wat too light to be called a foundation, but it doesnt have any skin care benefits which is I guess why they can't call it BB cream. It's refreshing to have a product with light coverage and a natural finish instead of dewy. Great for no makeup makeup days. * I found the Tawny shade of L.A. Girl Tinted Foundation in my local Ulta's clearance section and figured I'd give it a try. When I got home, I used Ulta's shade matcher and it told me I was really Warm Sand in this product (based off entering Ginger for bareMineral's COMPLEXION RESCUE Tinted Moisturizer Mineral SPF 30). Warm Sand perfectly matches my skin right now during the winter. I'll try Tawny again in the spring/summer, but it was a close match too. I love how lightweight this product feels and how easy it is to apply ‚Äî I dot it on right from the tube and the dab/blend with a lightly moist makeup sponge. It looks just slightly dewy but doesn't feel overly wet or sticky. It also works well under my bareMinerals BAREPRO 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation if I want to look more made up, but between the price and its natural look when used solo, it fits well with my minimalist approach to makeup. * I am 66 years old. It settled into my wrinkles and emphasized them.  Very sheer coverage. Not a good choice for me. * This is amazingggg!! it's creamy and dries so you don't need any powder, the finish is a natural satin finish and i have dry skin NC42 and the tan is perfection! * I love this foundation its a good one if you're looking for an affordable foundation thats light to medium coverage. I have pink on my cheeks and this covers it just enoiggt to not be seen. You cant beat that for the price."

If unsure, go a bit darker than normal. * I ordered 2W - Warm light - and it was almost white, so light and clearly defective. It did absolutely nothing other than make me have a Casper look. It is so sheer I can't imagine it doing anything even if it was the correct color.  I contacted Well People, I thought they should know how bad the product was, and they didn't care. * W3ll people... we need to talk about the shade range. People with darker skin tones like makeup too yet the shade range completely excludes anyone beyond tan. Thankfully the darkest shade works for me so I enjoy the product but it's hard to get behind a brand that doesn't give darker skintones a thought. * I was really hoping this product would work for me but it didn't. I found the baked foundation to be much more drying than other pressed powders I've previously used. Felt like it didn't go on well and had horrible coverage. Will not be buying again. * Takes forever to build up. Not for anyone who wants medium to full coverage. Light to medium at best. * Honestly if you're looking for a foundation to take a chance on.. this is definitely it. I'm not sure why I even chose to buy this but I love it!! I use it over concealer and it evens out my skin tone perfectly. Also does not make me look too orangey or cakey. * Just meh"

It was so easy to apply, felt nice on my skin, looks natural and I think m10 is my shade - it is spot on (for my beautiful summer complexion ) I'm excited to have found Mented! not a con for me, because i don't choose a makeup to smell good, but definitely seems like fragrance wasn't added.

I have pretty dry sky so I know to add a moisturizer before applying this. I am not saying this drying‚Ä¶but makeup ondry skin can appear patchy * This product feels and looks like you have no product on. * I have searched for the perfect match years! So excited to have finally found a shade so spot on with my skin tone that it's almost scary. The stick foundation is easy to apply, blends well and leaves me a great natural glow. * Looked awful on me. Horrible on oily skin and def dont get if you have light skin. This foundation isnt made for light skin tones which sucks. * Perfect match almost feels like a tinted moisturizer. I'm oily so I still need a powder but for stick makeup it goes on smooth and doesn't run off. I'm sold * Okay so hear me out.. the color match to my skin is amazing!!! it blended beautifully. However, I have combo oily skin and nothing could have prepared me for how shiny and oily this foundation is. This is not a matte foundation so beware!! * Hidden Gem hands down. I have been looking for a good foundation in general for a few years now, I went high end low end drugstore I went tinted moisturizer to full coverage and non did what I actually wanted. I love make up but finding a good foundation for my oily skin that wont force me to re touch (which I'm horrible at by the way, always makes it worse) was close to impossible without making me feel like I have pounds of make up on especially for work. I had tried the Hourglass foundation stick which was highly rated and felt very chalky on my skin. I did a search of stick foundations and came across this one. I am the lightest shade in this line and am on my way to re up for a 3rd time! I have never purchased 1 item more than once since they end up not working out for a while. The coverage is amazing from one layer to a 2 layers if I want a fuller look. It glides on like butter on my skin  and gives me a glow without an oily look if that makes sense. I rarely have to completely set my face because it sets so nice on its own and will literally last me over 9 hours without any cracks or separation and looks like I just applied it minutes ago. It makes my face feel hydrated and not like I'm wearing loads of make up. This is a long review and I never leave a review but I am truly in love with this foundation! I am so thankful for this brand because I am the in between when it comes to make up, I'm a semy fare complexion with neutral undertones. Many lines have a Yellow undertone or an olive undertone which makes me look washed out. This is truly a bang for your buck and will leave your make up looking flawless."

It is a bit hard to use to start with but once you figure it out it's very nice.  Good for older and younger skin.  I'm 64 and it's the best I've ever used. * This foundation is perfect for evening out skin tone without making it look like you painted your make up on. I really love pairing it with cream contour and cream blush, and then just setting it with a setting spray- it gives a gorgeous dewy finish. You can set it with powder to make it a little more long lasting too. I always try to catch it on sale. I think having a gorgeous light coverage foundation like this is perfect for an interview, meeting someone new, or embracing your natural beauty! Its made me feel so much more confident in my own skin. * The origin to my villain story. I listened to an ULTA employee, first foundation for my high school homecoming. Three days later I broke out, having clear skin all my life. Ever since, it never stopped. I had to go on meds to cure my acne. Don't use. * I used to use the old face and body without the radiance and always loved it so im not surprised I love the new version especially because I like more of a sheen/glow to my skin. This is a very sheer coverage foundation but is buildable if you want a little more coverage. Also I can apply this over my skincare without it pilling! * I never tried the original face and body. Honestly, I was never interested in this foundation until I started watching Miss Megan Robinson on tik tok. Seriously you NEED to follow her!! I generally have oily skin. It's been a lot more calm, and a lot less oily after I got rid of all the actives, and JUST started washing, toning, and using AN OIL (I know right, but it's true, oil loves oil, using an oil will keep your skin from producing a lot of oil) I can now wear this foundation confidently, and it is BEAUTIFUL!! It's friction activated so I suggest applying with fingers and rubbing it in so you can start to feel the ""gripping and thickening"" action that happens with this foundation(which is the best most fun part for me). The coverage is obviously light but it looks like perfected skin. Only the best things are peeking through. Everything blends nicely on top, and I mean EVERYTHING, from all different brands. It wears great too and looks even better as the day goes on. Its softly radiant and skin like if you powder (which I still do) and if you don't you'll look like a freshly hot glazed donut (some people like that, some people don't) I get the hype of this foundation and dare I say it's made it into my top 5 line up!!?? Coming from an oily girl that is shocking. If you're wondering, I use the Danessa Myricks yummy skin balm in translucent as a primer, this foundation, all my other creams and liquids, and I set with Mac studio fix powder and one size setting spray. PERFECTED NATURAL RADIANT SKIN * Wear it everyday and have received unprovoked complements. * So light!  Perfect for summer and the heat.

It doesn't dry matte, so definitely set it with powder. I'd say a little goes a long way! It last all day & still look beautiful even after a workout. The only areas that would slightly crease would be around my smile lines & chin but nothing crazy. I wish the foundation would be more available but it's so hard to find & the shade range isn't the best but overall 10/10 I would recommend! My closest shade is A05.5. I also tried mixing V05 & V04 to get my shade if anyone is wondering. I hope this helps.  :) * Coming from an Ulta Employee, after trying every foundation under the sun, this foundation makes my skin look FLAWLESS, airbrushed, smooth. I do have to set with a translucent loose powder because it is still a little tacky in my opinion. Shades are FANTASTIC. A02 matches me the closest; however if there was a slightly paler shade with a yellow undertone that would be my perfect match. I ordered A01 and A02 on YesStyle and to me 1 was almost darker than 2, but it may just be the undertones. ULTA PLEASE BRING THIS BACK. It took me over a week with express shipping on YS btw I paid $19 extra FYI In case anyone was going to order it, I think it ships from China.

This is my favorite foundation!! I literally bought 3 bottles because I have a feeling Ulta might discontinue this foundation...
 FYI- you can still find VDL on Yesstyle BUT it's NOT the same foundation. The one on Yesstyle has SPF & it has more of a dewy finish üò© * I hope Ulta is not going to stop selling this foundation. It is an amazing satin finish foundation. Looks flawless on the skin and makes blemished skin look smooth. Wears beautifully throughout the day and is full coverage. Highly recommend. FYI if they stop selling it at Ulta you can find it on YesStyle. * I bought this foundation in the color A06. I tend to have a hard time finding foundations because I am in the weird shade range where I'm typically between medium/tan and dark/deep in various brands. I have Neutral slightly golden/olive undertones and find that many brands get close but not perfectly my shade. Most times foundations are too golden (almost orange looking), too cool, exactly neutral when I need just a touch of yellow in the foundation, or they just skip my shade altogether. I was pleasantly surprised when this foundation was an exact match. I love the natural finish to this foundation. I have dehydrated combo skin that if not properly hydrated will get oily in the t-zone (mostly nose area) and will remain normal or slightly dry everywhere else. When I wear this for several hours my foundation goes from very natural to radiant but not oily as my t-zone starts to break into a bit of a shine. I really don't have anything bad to say about this foundation except because of the limited shade range there's a chance you may not find a good match depending on your skin tone and undertone. Hopefully Ulta continues to keep this foundation available. * I would describe this foundation on my skin as full coverage with a satin/slight dewy finish. I have acne prone skin with acne scars and this foundation covers everything without causing any texture. Long wearing and mask proof. Doesn't cause breakouts. Would recommend for various skin types."

And quite drying immediately on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this for aging skin whatsoever. Great product for on the go touch ups on oily skin. * I don't care for the sponge applicator because it really doesn't go on right, but I found that using a brush to apply is so much better and it goes on more evenly.  You can add more where needed without it looking blotchy.  I love it! Used the color Sienna * Goes smooth and cover some imperfections, but looks natural. Leaves your skin soft and beautiful. * Lightest shade, Ivory.  You MUST prep the skin with moisturizer, sunscreen and either CT Hollywood Flawless Filter or the Maybeline knockoff or a dewy primer or sunscreen.  Buff in with a brush after applying concealer where needed.  Use powder bronzer, blush and highlight and a setting spray.  It looked amazing on my 48 year old dry skin and lasted all day.  Not powdery, didn't settle in lines, let's your skin peek through (is light coverage).   I really love it. * I thought since it's called age perfect it would be a moisturizing creamy powder. Nope. It's super drying and I have combination oily skin not even dry. Feels horrible right on application You can feel the makeup. Didn't blur anything. I had to take it off within 10 mins of application. Don't buy this stuff. * I wanted to try a cream to powder foundation to try to cover some dark spots. 
This covered what I wanted. It does look a little dry after application but I'm oily so it looks more natural after a few hours. * I love the age rewind concealer and seen this after looking for a good powder foundation. it is a really creamy, finely milled powder. I don't think it's really pigmented but you get enough coverage to even everything out and in my opinion it really does blur. I use a flat top Kabuki brush to buff it in, slowly building up layers. I take product and tap it in where I need more coverage with a concealer brush. I find I get the most coverage this way. it's like your skin but better. gives you a nice natural finish and doesn't look cakey if you slowly buff and build. will be trying this as a setting powder for liquid since it blurs. it also doesn't make me breakout!"

Also, this powder has sparkles in it I guess to conceal how drying and powdery it makes the skin.. * I love this powder, my skin is dry but this powder always feels comfortable on, never adds any texture as other powders have for me in the past, def one of my fav powders * I LOVE this pressed powder! It takes away the look of shine and makes my skin look refined and even toned. I bought Ivory and it is the ideal shade for my skin tone, medium fair with pink undertones. It works well worn over concealer and foundation, or on its own. And, better still, it looks invisible and feels like nothing on skin! The mirrored compact is the perfect size for taking on the go and it even comes with an applicator sponge on a clear, hinged divider inside. Hynt thought of everything with this pressed powder! I will definitely buy again:) * I've always been reluctant to wear powder - most of the time I end up looking cake-y. This finishing powder is a game changer - so easy to apply and bonus, the packaging is so adorable! But more importantly my skin looks so velvety and super plump, definitely will be coming back for more when I'm through with this! * Love using this powder in-between zoom meetings to touch up my skin. Just gives me a more even/finished and natural look * One of my favorite products from Hynt * I used this foundation with the foam puff it came packaged with. Do not use with a brush, the powder is finely milled and will fall off your brush! I wore it over serum and moisturizer. My face got a little shiny throughout the day but that is common for me, as I have combination skin. I like that the coverage is buildable, I was able to apply two layers and achieved the coverage I was looking for. Best of all, the ingredients are natural and truly clean! No SLS, no parabens, no Lauryl Lysine, no Bismuth oxychloride! So happy Ulta is carrying this brand!"
189,189,189,189,hourglass,vanish seamless finish liquid foundation,pimprod2020422,2575785," * For a pro makeup artist, ( yes, you need to be a pro to know how to work with it) this is so far one of the best foundations that I have ever worked with. I recommend performing a gentle face exfolation before bed time and removing any peach fuzz for any makeup aplication, not just this foundation. It makes a huge difference in aplication and appearance of the final look/finish.
It works best with the Vanish smoothing primer. (To smooth down the pores that every human being has) It is runny but extreamly pigmented. Do not use too much or it will look cakey.Best apply with a dense buffer brush (Morphe 444 is my favorite) and then press it in with a beauty blender. I use the professional Kryolan setting spray first, and then set it with a good powder.( Jeffree Star, Fenty or Kryolan powder) It holds for 14h even in humid Florida. Best foundation for events. It's best for normal/ combination skin. I wish they had more shades.
Unfortunately it just has been discontinued, tho the company has gave me insites that they are working on perfecting the formula and making a new foundation for combination/oily skin (they currently carry luminous foundations for normal/dry skin) * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * This product is so thin & runny! Like water consistency. I pumped one pump on my hand & it literally dripped off me. I shook the bottle so many times & it still remained runny. I gave it a try on my face because I wanted to give the foundation a chance but the product just settled right into any crevice it could. I could literally see wrinkles/lines I didn't even know I had. * I got this during a sale and was so excited to try my first Hourglass product. I followed the instructions and reviews and only used a very little amount. It brings out my pores horribly, dries down very weird and makes my skin dry, and even though it feels light on my skin my skin feels a tiny bit sticky, not something I usually experience with prestige brand foundations. This is a miss for me. * This foundation is very reminiscent of Marc Jacob's 'Remarcable' . Full coverage and matte with a pore filling matte primer underneath . The bad reviews are really just people who don't know how to apply makeup . * Words do not explain how buttery this foundation is I have dry to normal skin and it blends it two to three glides. Will never use another foundation"
190,190,190,190,smashbox,studio skin 24 hour full coverage waterproof foundation,pimprod2009758,2552423," * Luckily I night this on a good sale a ways back but it is just not it. I have combo oily skin and so far regardless of the primer or moisturizer this just doesn't look good and will break down. I've been using juvias place which I like ten times better and I don't have to try to make it work. This foundation also oxidizes orange..so not just a shade but it'll turn more orange as well. I'm gonna try to find something to mjx it with but I won't be purchasing again and wouldn't recommend it. * I have oily combo skin, and this foundation did not stand the test of time. It felt very heavy, and transferred with the slightest touch (with setting powder). Only a few hours in, and it was breaking apart on my face, highlighting even the slightest texture. My pores were literally drinking this product up. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a foundation, and could not wait to take it off. * I have combo skin, I use the Bobby brown moisturizer primer underneath and only use a tiny bit with a brush. Looks flawless!! Do not use to much product otherwise it will look cakey, if you need extra coverage apply only to specific area with smaller brush. * 32f (no active breakout/indented scars only on cheeks/combination skin)This foundation has the worst formula I have ever used on my skin. I tried two different primers underneath and tried it on it's own and it just refused to settle or smooth out. It creases badly and makes skin look dry and caked with very minimal use of the product that looked worse and worse if you tried to use even a tiny bit more. Powders and setting spray do nothing to help. I tried beauty blenders and brushes and neither made it better. I ended up going back to a trusty Revlon foundation that was way cheaper and a much better formula. Do not waste your money if you do not have perfect smooth skin. * I have sensitive skin with large amounts of rosacea and occasional eczema. This product covers my redness very well, and can many my dry areas seemingly disappear. Smashbox was also a line that came up multiple times during my search for products best for sensitive skin. * Maybe this just doesn't work with some skin types. I've given this several goes with different amounts of product and application techniques and it always manages to cake up and accentuate every pore after it's settled. I decided to give this one more go, applying after a glowy moisturizer that managed to save some of my other cakey products and it still had the same issues after setting for about 20 minutes. * It has perfect coverage,  a very little goes a long way.  Love the Matt finish I got.  Like  all foundations,  you have to prepare your skin before you applying anything to it.  Use a brush to apply.  I patted it on."
