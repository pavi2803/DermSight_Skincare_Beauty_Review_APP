1,urban decay,face bond self-setting waterproof foundation,pimprod2044818,2623593," * This foundation emphasized all my pores even with skin prep. I was oily after 4 hours. * I love this foundation. * It's only light coverage. If you want full coverage, you need to add layers, but if you have large pores, it will enhance them. * I absolutely love this foundation! I have very oily skin and tend to stay away from liquid foundations, even ones for oily skin, cause theyball just melt off. I read the description on this one and decided to give it a try and im so happy i did. It stays on all day and when i wore it during a 14 mile run- IT DID NOT BUDGE. I will definitely be buying this again. * I have never loved a foundation as passionately, as I love this. I have struggled for so long to find a foundation that match as well to my light olive undertone. And dear God, does this foundation just melt into my skin. Not only is the color absolutely stunning for me personally but I honestly forget I'm wearing make up at all which I feel like is something that a lot of foundations claim but almost none actually follow through with. As the title says if urban decay ever gets rid of this foundation, I will personally start a picket line. 😅 * Initially bought the foundation because l'll be traveling soon and needed something that came in a plastic bottle. Packaging is 10/10. Love the squeeze bottle and how its so compact

When wearing the foundation without primer, formula made my skin greasy and dry at the same time and i started to feel it on my face throughout the day. For reference, i have combination skin that runs more dry

With primer, good medium coverage matte finish that resembles a powder formula when dry. I also feel it less on my face through the day. 

Overall, foundation didnt change my life but overall recommend for travel * I have oily skin, no acne. Even with primers, after 4hrs this separates on my face. I wanted to love it because it feels amazingly lighweight on skin when i rub it im with my fingertips. I have a few whiteheads on my cheek from oily mess on skin while at work."

3,dior,dior forever fluid skin glow foundation,pimprod2036824,2605019," * I have been using this foundation for 3 years. It has good coverage without being thick.
Good selection of colors to match anyone. * I loved how this felt on my dry skin and it didn't seem to clog my acne-prone skin, but I am a very pale person with very neutral undertones. All of the shades either make me look yellow and somehow too dark or make me look even paler, even if its a darker shade due to the undertones. It also didn't last as long as I wish it did for the price point, but it's Dior so I can't complain. As long as you aren't the color of like a cracker this would probably work just not for the super pale, not yellow or pink girlies. * I am not one to stray from my usual makeup routine. However, turning 50 has made me change it up. My Ulta consultant talked me into trying this foundation. I am so glad she did. Does not look cakey and does not seem to settle into my fine lines like my last one did. This will be my go to from now on. * I am not a pro with makeup, but after trying a few other products this was my favorite and used for my wedding. It did not disappoint either! Had me feeling like I was glowing, smooth application and gives the picture perfect glow look. Not too much, but just enough! Blended very well and gave me the extra boost of confidence on my big day! You do not need a whole lot either so it lasted me over a month almost 2 and I was wearing about everyday. * I have used/ tried every foundation. This is by far the best. It doesn't sit in fine lines, keeps me glowing. All is really need is half a pump. I use the concealer too in a shade lighter * Great foundation! * As someone who lives in a dry area so my skin is constantly dry, this foundation worked so well with me! I absolutely loved it! Only downside is that I think I got the wrong shade because I look orange lol but i still love it! btw this foundation has a slight floral scent!"

This foundation goes on really well and I was impressed. I will get a darker color in the future. It is a lighter coverage.I loved that it was not cakey. * I was not expecting this quality it is light however it is buildable. definitely feels like skin. The shade could've been a little lighter for myself however, it was easy to make it work. It doesn't smell bad at all. * I was not expecting this quality it is light however it is buildable. definitely feels like skin. The shade could've been a little lighter for myself however, it was easy to make it work. It doesn't smell bad at all. * This is my dream foundation, it is a fluid foundation with a natural finish, perfect for normal skin, it blends very easily, its coverage is buildable, it really is one of my favorite bases, its packaging is very elegant I love it!! The tone was perfect for me * I received this product for free from INF and Lancôme in exchange for my honest review. Has SPF and an inclusive shade range. No discernible scent. It accentuates my fine lines and wrinkles. A great product on young skin * I wasn't sure if I would like this product or not, but it was better than expected. It it is buildable coverage, but I used it for more light coverage. It covered my dark spots and redness fairly well. I do wish it was a little more hydrating. If i dont properly moisturize, then it looks a little spotty. Overall I really like it and wear it daily. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. * One of the best foundations I have tried. It's pretty light but also covered well. I know that sounds ironic, but it's true. Lots of foundations that are light  don't provide much coverage. This does. Like with all foundation, you have to prep the skin well to avoid patches or flakiness with this formula. It leaves a nice matted finish which I like. I don't like the glass oily look. The shade 215c is also perfect for my complexion (cool pink undertone beige). Overall, a go to in my bag."

8,nars,light reflecting advanced skincare foundation,pimprod2030141,2591117," * Seems to match my skin well. Always have that problem finding a foundation that will match up to my skin just right. I have only used a few times. I only got it a few days ago. Not enough time to review it. Price, I guess is good. Other places had it cheaper. I have a Ulta card. So that is where I buy my makeup products. So far I like it. * I put everyone onto this foundation and they love it and have started to use it * I love this foundation, but many of the light shades lean yellow. If they were truer to neutral and cool, I would definitely repurchase this foundation. * I LOVE this foundation!!! Tried many other brands (prestige & common) and this is the only one that works for my skin! I'm 39 with dry/combo skin, and I've NEVER had an issue with coverage or buildability. I use NYX Marshmellow Primer, then apply foundation with a sponge, and finish with setting spray. Good to go, all day! * made a switch from silicone-base to water-base, and this product was life changing. I still love my MAC studio fix but this is giving it. Run for its money! Perfect for my dry skin. * made a switch from silicone-base to water-base, and this product was life changing. I still love my MAC studio fix but this is giving it. Run for its money!

I wanted to love so bad because its not bad but way too shiny for my taste."
9,mac,studio fix fluid spf15 24hr matte foundation + oil control,pimprod2044825,2622206," * This new formula is so incredibly disappointing. It has to be the worst high end foundation I've ever used. I cannot understand why Mac changed it because they had to be aware of how bad it looked. It's cakey, it looks like sand settled on your face, sits in all lines and creases and makes you look about 10 years older, separates, it's super greasy, very light coverage now, and transfers all over the place! Just an awful, frustrating, disappointing product. I've moved on to another brand after 15 years of loyalty to Mac because the foundations they are offering now are not the Mac quality they once were. * Thanks to Maggie frm Ulta in Fort Lauderdale for taking the time to find the right foundation shade for me. * My shade in the original Studio Fix is no longer the same shade, so I had to get remached. While trying on shades, I noticed the foundation looked and felt different. I asked for a sample instead of purchasing an entire bottle. I'm glad I did because from that sample, I realized how awful the new formula is! I was able to wear it 4 times from the sample jar and all 4 times I absolutely hated it! I can not describe the frustration and anxiety it put me through as I used different skin preps, techniques and touch ups through out the day to try to get it to look good, but it just looked awful! It made me look ashy, wrinkly, oily and chalky dry! Every time I looked in the mirror I just wanted to wash it off of my face!  Who brainwashed Mac into thinking this is a better product than their original!? The remaining foundation in the sample jar went straight to the garbage where it belongs! I will not be spending a single cent on this. Mac has lost my money, I'm moving on to another brand. * The formula change nightmare started a few months ago for me. I went to buy a new bottle of the original Studio Fix and had to get the new reformulated one. I cannot understand why Mac ruined it. It's absolutely terrible, it feels and looks like greasy, chalky sand on my face. It moves and separates all over looking terribly cakey, it transfers onto everything at the slightest touch and settles into all lines and wrinkles. It's just bad, bad, bad! I've been looking elsewhere for a new foundation and have come across a few that will work decently, but nothing like the original Studio Fix. I keep going back to Mac and trying this new formula with different skin preps only to be frustrated by the fact that nothing makes it look better, it makes my skin look awful every single time I wear it. Makeup is not supposed to be this difficult and frustrating, it's supposed to make you look good, and Mac had THE best and only foundation to do that and they decided to completely ruin it. I hope they catch on quickly and bring back the original Studio Fix. * I wore the original formula for years and would always receive compliments that my skin was flawless; people couldn't even tell that I had on foundation. The new formula is terrible on my skin. Coverage isn't as good, & it has a drying and aging effect that sucks any bit of youthfulness out of my face. Literally ages my face. It's just bad. I don't need the fragrance they added, nor the pump. I'll gladly trade both features for the original, reliable formula that blended so well. Having to look for a new foundation brand takes much time. * Great coverage and color * I bought a bottle of this foundation.The sales girls raved about this Mac foundation and how it was reformulated and how it was the best and that I would absolutely love it. I tried it for a few days of wear and could not, for the life of me, understand what I was supposed to love, exactly. It settled on all my fine lines, it creased terribly, it looked cakey, chalky after a few hours, and it felt dry with an greasy under layer as the foundation sat on top of my skin. Nothing I tried made it look better, it was honestly frustrating. It was so bad! I'm baffled at how anyone could like this. I do not recommend this foundation, all you'll get out of it is terrible looking skin and frustration. I've never returned make up, I returned this one."

I love how it covers my skin imperfections 
It is smooth 
Not caky at all * The coverage is so so good, the shade range is huge and its acne safe (for my skin). * This kind of sat in my pores and creases. I returned it * this is my go to foundation for less intense makeup looks. i wear a lot of bold goth makeup, but when i dont want to do
that, this is a good foundation. it has good coverage (though i tend to have pretty clear skin). i can barely feel it on my skin honestly. overall very good product! * Loved it! * This was drying so fast on my face that i couldn't even blend it at all. * Decided to try this foundation as I've been doing the tinted moisturizers for some time. This foundation is amazing. Leaves my skin looking flawless. Better yet, I don't need a loose powder over it! Got a lot of compliments!"

14,it cosmetics,cc+ nude glow lightweight foundation + glow serum with spf 40,pimprod2031824,2594106," * I absolutely love this foundation! It's my holy grail makeup product. I honestly ended up purchasing it just by chance because it said it contained skincare ingredients and I was trying to find a foundationt that was better for my skin. It feels amazing on my skin and is really amazing as a color correcter, even just a thin layer helps cover redness without looking heavy. It has a very nice silky texture and a beatiful glowy finish. I recommended it to a friend and she loved it as well! * Not so greasy on your face and works very well . * Evens out my skin tone. Love that it looks like I have no makeup on. * this is now my favorite foundation. it's not too heavy and blends SEAMLESSLY into my skin. I use it with the IT foundation flat brush and it's amazing. the shade I got also perfectly matches my skin tone, like no other foundation i've had before. highly recommend * It took me a long time to try this. I wished I did sooner. I love how it make my skin and myself feel. Great color match and coverage. Confident, glowing and radiant.  Thank you it! * I like IT products because of their effectiveness. Even though the description is a lightweight foundation, it offers enough coverage to use when doing errands, etc. and I don't need more coverage. * I was wary to get this foundation at first because of the price, but i am glad that i did! I do not want a ton of coverage, and one layer of this is perfect for me! I will say, the natural glow is gorgeous but can be a bit much by the end of the day. However, a little bit of powder fixed that for me easily. I am very acne prone and this did not break me out!"

However I got this to help reduce fine lines and mature Very dry skin. It made it worse! It settled in the fine lines and made my dry spots worse!

I've never had a foundation settle like this and i wanted to love it but this just didn't sit right with my skin * I love this foundation! The color match is amazing, it's very hydrating, buildable coverage, and long lasting. A little goes a long way. I prefer to blend with my fingers and finish with a damp beauty blender. * really wanted to give this a chance but sadly it just wasnt for me ;( i have combo skin and makeup tends to separate/get cakey around my chin and forehead and sadly this one goes right into that category. at first it looks really good and it does hold up a dewy finish but after 1-2 hours-ish it got way too greasy on me, started flaking off, and also oxidized quite a bit, leaving an orangish tone to my skin. i did my makeup for class today and within hours all the makeup on my chin was patchy and mostly gone :c (i use both powder & setting spray) * I wanted to love this foundation. I really did. I've never had a foundation that matches my skin color so perfectly. (Fresco, 2C3) But I couldn't get past the smell. It's so bad! Maybe it's just me but it's the worst odor of any makeup I've ever used.  There are no words to describe it. I hoped the odor would die down a bit after it dried, but nope. If this foundation restored my skin to look like that of a twenty year old it would still be a hard no. I gave it two stars for color match."

17,pur,4-in-1 love your selfie longwear foundation & concealer,pimprod2005671,2544533," * I'm really picky about foundation and it took me years to find one that works for me. I used to be a matte girl because of my super oily skin but as I've gotten older i have too many lines and crepes for that to look good anymore. Couple that with the fact that everything makes me break out and it's impossible to find a good match until this! This strikes the balance between dewy and matte so I have a youthful glow without looking like a grease slick. It lasts well if I set it with powder and I love that it works as concealer too. The dual purpose applicator is great. The fact that it goes by undertone makes the color match the best i have found. I haven't had issues with breakouts either! Perfection! * It moves and settles into the creases around my eyes and shows every pore. I hate it. * I have been using this foundation for years. It was recommended by someone at Ulta. I try other foundations out there just to see if there is a better one and I always end uo back at this one. I tried the Estee Lauder double wear just because everyine raved and it did not look or stay any longer or better than this one so returned it and went back to this. Love this foundation. Its overall a great one! * I honestly loved this so much like i love it and i feels like i don't have anything on.Its so light weight and it has such a beautiful finish but unfortunately it broke me out. * I looooove this foundation. I've seen other reviews talking about it being cakey and other negative things but if you know how to properly prep your face before applying foundation (this applies to ANY foundation) then you will LOVE this brand. I have Very sensitive skin and hate the feel of foundation on my face but I don't mind this one at all! You get a full coverage and it's lightweight. I've been using this brand for a year and I'm truly impressed. * I love this foundation i just which the shades would expand in store. The coverage and longevity is insane. I have replaced my double wear with this foundation. It's cheaper and better. I love how the wand is on the inside so that i can use it also as a concealer…Also there is primer and skincare in this foundation!!! * I really need a gluten free foundation, and this isn't worth the money. Like others have said, it looks cakey. Somehow it LOOKS dry, but it slides right off like it's an oil. Settled into every freaking line and ended up looking like bad Halloween makeup. I will give it one more chance - going to try it without moisturizer underneath, because it was hard to wash off the back of my hand. If it still sucks, it's getting returned."
18,it cosmetics,cc+ cream natural matte foundation with spf 40,pimprod2044261,2621797," * Ive tried everything to make this work and it's still bad. I use primer, powder, setting spray. I noticed the shade was too warm for me so i corrected it with blue corrector and it actually oxidized even worse. Transfers even with powder and setting spray. I dont even have oily skin. Skin looks so textired and patchy. When I apply my blush it makes the foundation come off. * Good coverage overall, gives even complexion. Downside, no matter what primer, skincare prep I do it ALWAYS gets so gross and oily. You literally feel it and need to touch up every hour or else youre a wlaking shiny disco ball. After you touch up, it comes off and gets really patchy and not cute. * I returned this cc cream back to Ulta. I have combination skin, oily in the T-zone. No matter what primer I used, this cream didn't last over 5 hours of wear time without looking blotchy. * I do love the IT cc full coverage.  I am 60 with old school sun damage, uneven skin tone, redness & old acne scars.  Stays on perfectly until i use make up remover at night.  This foundation helps me feel more confident & beautiful with all the things i did wrong back in the 60s & 70s. * Looked good when I first put it on. Within 2 hours my face looked slathered with oil.  Foundation separates and creases around nose area. I could feel the need to blot my face it was so gross. Used to be good. They changed the formula. Thumbs down * I have used MANY foundations but once I found this 5 years ago, I searched no more! Recently I bought the same color I always do but have been noticing later in the day it oxidizes to an orange color around my T-zone. After doing some online research, it appears they swithed their formula and others have been having the same issue. Makes me so sad because again, ill now be on the search for the perfect foundation. * Easy application"

Overall I love the finish of the skin tint- it's very natural and glowy! Would definitely recommend if you want a your skin but better look! I also recommend going in person to get shade matched, because the undertones are a little tricky! * Fenty Beauty Eaze Drop Blurring Skin Tint in shade 3 by Rihanna provides light to medium coverage, feels so soft and supple on your skin, and made me want to use it in the place of my moisturizer. If it had spf in it, I probably would. I really loved how light this skin tint felt. It wasn't cakey or dry, didn't irritate my skin, or make me feel weighted down like some tints can.

The design of the bottle and its applicator tip made it so easy to apply and made the application process simple and mess free. It felt so hygienic. 

This is a quality skin tint. I would buy this one over and over again. * Very nice coverage skin tint drops. It matches my skin tone perfectly, I have the colour number 1. it feels very light on the skin but at the same time covers very well the imperfections. It has a scent and I find it a bit strong. * I'm at the age where less is more. This skin tint is perfect for my skin and wants right now. It does oxidize a bit so I should've gone lighter. Makes my skin look great. * prefer light weight tints and have extremely sensitive skin.   this didn't break me out or leave me itchy, was blendable and buildable if needed and worked well with other cream products. * I really loved how this skin tint applied because it has a very thin consistency that allows it to blend easily into the skin. Since it is so thin, if you have any discoloration or texture, they will show through, so you may need to use multiple layers. This is definitely meant for drier skin because my wilier skin broke this down really quickly, even with a really good setting powder and long wearing setting spray. For many, this will be a wonderful summer skin tint."

Typically foundations will blend well and then after they oxidize, they look completely different and not in a good way. When I first applied this one, I didn't think it was the right shade, but after about 10 minutes it looks flawless. I have used different brand blush, powder, and eye shadows along with it and it's versatile that way as well. 4 stars instead of 5 just because I feel it takes slightly longer to apply than other fountains and the longevity of it is good, but does look iffy after about 12-14 hours. Overall a good product for the price. * I would only recommend this product to oily skin girlies because i have dry skin, and this seemed to make it worse. As the day went on, it would get patchier. * This foundation does not stay on the face, easily comes off. My other products arent sitting on it well. When i get home i want to immediately take it off because i dont like the feeling of it on my face.

This bottle and cap is pretty much the same as the more matte version. The cap on both comes right off. If it's in a makeup bag or you're travelling, good luck. Most foundations you can pick it up from the top of the bottle and the cap won't come off, but this one comes off with ease. * I love the color and application of this foundation, but it always settles into skin lines no matter what primer is used so after about 5-6 hours it looks dry and flaky. For short term use, it's nice, but for an all-day wear, I wouldn't recommend."

This product has been the best addition to my makeup routine. It is great coverage and last a long time. Worth the expensive investment! * It's not a horrible product, but it's definitely not great. Doesn't stay on too well and I'm always leaving blobs of makeup residue all over our work phones which is so embarrassing. Also I look antiqued in this some days with it visibly flaking * This is my first time trying this and like the look. * If you are like me and enjoy hoodie season, but hate the transfer putting it on this is the foundation you are looking for! I have tried several others but they wipe off on my hoodie with the smallest touch, even with setting sprays. This foundation did not transfer or smear. I did use a brush to blend better. * Combo skin girlie here.. if you're like me and looking for something that covers, blurs and self-sets, don't to listen to the Tarte haters. I put off trying this for so long after my favorite foundation was discontinued, and now I wish I tried it months ago. 

I'm someone who at times has to bend over backwards with prep to get foundations to work for me, and I did VERY minimal prep with this - one glowy moisturizer and a priming spray. Looks great applied with fingers but used a brush to layer more coverage in spots and it didn't look streaky. Works great with shape tape concealer. 

I do agree with reviews that it doesn't necessarily do any favors for smile lines, but the smile lines are going to exist regardless and I wasn't expecting them to disappear with this product. I find that the formula softens a bit throughout the day as you wear it. 

In foundations I'm typically neutral leaning cool beige, but I went with 27H warm honey and it works well. * really wanted to love this . great color match but settles into pores and smile lines . have to touch up constantly rubs off very easy, I tried with their primer and setting spray still not good. I only wear foundation for acne cover up. I have larger pores and dry skin in only 33. * I was scared to try it at first but I have the shape tape concealer, and the foundation works very well for me as someone who has combination skin. its lightweight sometimes I forget I have it on"

28,beautycounter,skin twin featherweight foundation,pimprod2038184,2606483," * I truely like the way the foundation glides on and covers. * I had high hopes for this foundation, considering all the positive reviews, but I found it to be subpar. The smell was absolutely terrible, I found the coverage to be uneven, and after an hour or so of wear, I looked in the mirror and it really exaggerated my fine lines and pores. I for sure would not recommend this foundation to anybody over the age of 35. * This is a no for me. It smells terrible and does not work on my skin. Exaggerates dry spots, separates in oily areas, and looks cakey with any amount of product. I've tried applying with fingers, brushes, and sponges. I'm really disappointed I spent so much on it. Drugstore foundations are much better quality than this one! * This is a difficult foundation to work with, the coverage never looks even to me and it's not buildable. up close, I can see it pills on my skin if I pass the sponge over it more than a couple of times. cream products don't layer over it well - it's hard to blend cream blush, bronzer and highlighter on top and it transfers and moves all over the face. It doesn't really set down, even with powder. I have dry skin and never have issues with uneven coverage or getting a foundation to set down, with or without setting powder. I'm just not a fan, I have wet n wild, Catrice, urban decay and Pat McGrath foundations that all perform better across the cost spectrum. * This a wonderful foundation. It gives perfect coverage, making my skin look dewy and fresh.   The best part is that it is a clean product, without the bad stuff.I love this brand. * Not enough coverage for my aging skin! * Unsure. It's not like it's a bad product. I feel it's good quality. I think maybe for a lighter foundation could be a good find. I feel for the price, what my expectations were; not a good buy necessarily. Fell a bit flat for me. I've also only used a couple (2-3) times. Maybe it grows. My skin feels nice.
I don't feel excited afterwords-if that makes sense? Sometimes I put on foundation and I'm like ""OO-Hello there!"" I put this on and feel like…ehh. Best way I can put it. I did have a more positive prospective when adding a glow enhancer. It's ok."

I use the regular foundation.  Then I put this on very last.  This is amazing product. * Goes on smoothly and covers very well!  I will purchase it again!! * I have found my forever compact!

I have tried a number of known products and hands down IT has it all! * This is now my favorite foundation. Very light with super coverage and very natural looking. Will continue to buy this again. * Im not too familiar with powder foundation so i decided to try this one and it went on smoothly, not cakey, blends wells. * I loved this product so much and went to buy another one and now they have removed the sunblock which was a huge plus.

It is very hard to shade match my skin. I bought this foundation bc of Nikkie LA Rose's review ....in my opinion she is never wrong. She says it's beautiful. * I tried this wanting to love it & it was so streaky I hated it * I tried this foundation after using ""born this way"" for years just to try something new.  I used it for 2 months and i was wondering why my skin was drying out more, super patchy with the fundation on and not flattering. And it definitely transfers and has an orange tint.  Will never buy again. * I just bought two shades of this and i gave it three trys. Every time i had really bad seperation not even 2 hrs after putting it on. 

The first day i didnt  use snything under it, so I definitely thought i was the problem. The second day i used a moisturizer, still had separating. Third day i went for a more water based moisturizer and still had separation so i returned it. 
I prefer to use moisturizer instead of primers. * I got it for the full coverage and trandfer proof perk but it does excentuate dryness on the face. I love it with the powder but i have to use a setting spray to cover the dry spots it brings out in my skin unfortunately. * Its a good foundation and has pore safe ingredients so its none-comedogenic my only issue is it oxidizes really bad so pretty hard to find the correct shade."

I've tried other brands but always have gone back to using L'Oréal. * Beautiful color match smooth application lovely coverage * L'Oreal is the next best thing if you can't afford higher quality like Lancome.  I would appreciate it if they would get rid of the square top so you can get it off to get to quantity left at the bottom instead of wasting it. * L'Oreal changed the formula of their Infallible liquid foundation in 2024. I have worn Infallible for years, typically applying it on moisturized skin with a damp beauty blender, and it was always perfect, even without setting. I am a little disappointed with the new formulation. It is stickier, a little less blendable on my mature skin, and immediately settles into my laugh lines (even with a L'Oreal primer). The shade I wear is a now more yellow or orange after a few hours, too. Some people say they like this new finish but it's no longer for me unless I can find the trick to applying it. 24 hours was just fine. I cannot think of a situation where I'd need a 32 hour foundation. * I love this foundation which is liquidy. I mixed it with a little warmer shade in a different brand which gave me a natural look. It doesn't give me a cakey makeup look at all. It lasts longer which I really as I like to wear make up all day. * I used to love this product but recently it gave me a rash reaction :( * ive been using this for awhile and if you choose to buy it dont touch your face at all it literally melt off"

Leaves your face looking hydrated all day * Sad ive only now just discovered this reformulated foundation. I use to use the older version of this and i liked the staying power but it enhanced my texture it made my skin look like an orange peel. My favorite long wearing matte was always the too faced og matte foundation and then they discontinued it for the soft matte i tried it didnt like it does not stay on for the texas summers. This one is so good it reminds me of the old versison of the too faced matte. Ive been using double wear since they discontinued the too faced and it was dry looking so i started looking for other options. This is so smoothing i look younger it glides over texture my skin looks so smooth. The shades do lean more yellow. I'm a warm neutral skin tone and the cool light peach was an exact match. * I absolutely LOVE Bare Minerals bare pro! The performance and color options are absolutely amazing. * Sensitive skin, I was not able to use this foundation. Coverage was good, just not something I can use. * My product was busted in the box. I called and asked what my options were because I don't live the are and they said they couldn't mail it to me that I would have to come back. I called the same day and had the receipt in hand. * Literally one of the only foundations that doesn't leave me oily!It has suck clean ingredients too! * I was so happy with this brand.

35,polite society,more than a pretty face skin-caring foundation,pimprod2040619,2615174," * For transparency, I received a bottle of the Polite Society More Than a Pretty Face Skin Caring Foundation as a free gift with purchase. I had low expectations because lately any liquid type of foundation isn't my preferred method. I had read many reviews that mentioned the tones being on the yellow or darker side so this added to my trepidation. But being free I wasn't going to pass it up and picked a tone that I thought would work for me.

Surprisingly it's a perfect match. I also like the texture of the product. It goes on easily with a foundation brush and coverage is better than I expected too. Had no problems with it settling into fine lines either. Wasn't greasy nor drying for me. The color I used is Very Light Neutral.

I don't know if I'd buy it again because a)  I prefer stick or powder foundation but overall I think this is better for my needs than several other products I have in my rotation and b) the packaging is terrible as most people are mentioning. It's an awkward shape and the cap is difficult to take off especially for those of us with aging hands. I feel that for the price the entire item should work including the bottle and pump. * I was hoping this foundation would be great after seeing people use it on tiktok, im 47 and have combo skin.  The shades are way to orange or way too white,  it caked into my wrinkles and came apart within 10 minutes after i applied it. Do not like the feel its heavy for a medium coverage. Do not recommend * I'm a foundation girlie and have tried a ton. I absolutely love this formula. This would be a10/10 for me if it weren't for the packaging. The bottle looks cute but the downside is the pump is horrible it went out before the foundation was even half way gone. * I'm actually shocked. I got this for free as a diamond gift and its quickly become my favorite foundation… even better than my Haus Labs! Which is saying a lot. The pump is mediocre but the product is so beautiful and natural looking. Received so many compliments on my skin since wearing it! * I had never heard of this foundation until Ulta offered it during the Platinum days. I loved Smashbox Studio Skin and I am so disappointed that it has been discontinued. I have been looking for something similar, and for free, I figured I would try this, even with mixed reviews. I absolutely love it. I am 43 with combo skin, leaning more towards oily. My main issue is redness, without any fine lines or texture issues. I noticed the colors were all pretty light, but I ordered fair light based on the color reccomended online, and it is a perfect match. One pump covers my whole face and it lasts all day after setting once with setting powder. it doesn't get oily or oxidize. It's a medium  coverage that makes my skin look flawless. I am shocked by how many complaints I have received. I feel like it is very thin  and you have to work quickly to blend it in,or you could have streaks. I've been using a beauty blender. with a brush coverage would be more full coverage than I am looking for. I definitely recommend, doesn't turn orange or cause oily skin for me. I am happy that a free gift turned into my new favorite foundation. I hope this helps at least one other person! * I have dry skin and wasn't expecting anything from this as it was an Ulta Diamond gift - it is now my new favorite foundation. I've never experienced the whole ""this foundation looks like skin"" until I tried this. It looks flawless but also offers coverage. It's pretty liquidy so I have to powder, and it even looks great under my other products. I'm so impressed. I don't even care for my other foundations now. It's perfect. So grateful for Ulta. I never would've tried this otherwise. I absolutely love it. * I have dry leaning normal, mature skin, applied over Glow Recipe Niaminicide drops. This covered and built well over my redness, high medium leaning full coverage while maintaining a light thinish consistency. It doesnt blur, my wrinkles and pores were still there. It self set and looked a smidge dry. Had I powdered, it would have been bad. I used cream contour and blush, it didnt disturb it and they wore as normal. At the end of the day I did have some product gathered in my smile and forehead wrinkle and it had worn away completely on my chin and was breaking up on my cheeks. I loved the coverage and maybe with the right base/primer it would work but as a less is more makeup girl, I'll pass. I dont want to apply 3 to 4 extra layers to ""make it work""."

Or you can use hydrating primers such as Hangover Benefit or Mac Hydrating , and use cream blush instead of a powder ones 
Coverage is super great you don't even need concealer 
Beautiful finish!
Lasts all day!
Love it! * Very disappoiinted in this foundation. I went to ulta for a color match. The employee recomended it. I immediately noticed it was cakey. She insisted it was due to my dry skin. 2 months later, still hate it. Makes my skin look dull and dry. The foundation settles into every pore of my body. Extremly cakey. * First of all, my skin isn't super acne prone. My skin is very pale/light, and neutral in tone. I used the LIGHTEST possible shade, and still looked like an Oompa Loompa. The shade range is awful, and this left my skin orange, cakey, high and DRY! NO! * I was so excited to try this for the benefit of the serum , but it was awful! I live in a dry clinate and this accentuated dryness on my face that no amount of moisturizer couid fix.  It went on incredibly thick and gave me a pasty & cakey look.  I switched back to the Even Better Broad Spectrum and that looks great."
39,natasha denona,hy-glam powder foundation,pimprod2044289,2624364," * I really wanted to like this, and the reviews led me to believe that I definitely would. I have combination skin, I'm very pale, and I'm over 40. This was absolutely awful. Cakey, patchy, and settled way more into fine lines than my previous liquid foundation did. Didn't stay on even with my setting spray either. A total miss for me. * Wow, this is the best powder foundation I have ever used and I mean ever I've been a make up artist for years and I have never seen a formula so beautiful on any type of skin. The colors are phenomenal. The range is beautiful. The formula is so blendable and buildable. It's beautiful on top of foundation for setting face. It's beautiful with Mac strobe cream… and other tinted moisturizers. Sometimes I'll use with a powder puff. I don't use the sponge it comes with even on myself. It's a little heavy carries too much product, but sometimes I will use a smaller loose, fluffy brush, especially in the t zone and a powder puff for setting the face. It is beautiful. If you have textured skin, it might seem a little heavy therefore you should use maybe a lighter brush so it doesn't bulk up on your skin, but that has nothing to do with formula. It's just customer error. It doesn't break me out. I am ultra sensitive. I can't use anything with talc in it and this is absolutely perfect. She needs to make a bronzer with this formula or a contour powder because it's probably the only face powder that doesn't break my skin out. * Ive been so on the fence about purchasing this product but my god im so glad i went for it- this is thee most beautiful powder ive ever used , the way i used this product was placing it in the areas i tend to press powder so under the eyes , around the mouth area just to set my concealer and brighten certain areas . Using just a bit it's perfect since its such a buildable formula it has insane coverage with minimal product on the brush . If youre looking for a smooth almost blurred undereye … GIVE IT A TRY!! Note : i have very dry sensitive skin . * I have enjoyed using powder foundations off and on since high school especially when traveling and needing to get out of the house quickly. However, they are not the best for aging skin that is becoming more dry. This is the first and only powder foundation I have ever used that actually looks like a liquid in that it looks Fresh and skin like with a healthy natural finish. I can get solid medium coverage with this with the use of a fluffy brush, a flat top brush and a pencil brush for any freckles or blemishes. Every time I use this, someone tells me my skin looks amazing. I've already bought two backups. I have a fair slightly pink neutral complexion and I wear N1. I highly recommend! * I've been using Physitians Fomula powder foundation with SPF 30 for many years,  which was cheap and had a very good coverage but I hated how it accentuate my pores and had so much fall out. I finally got the ND powder on Black Friday and it blew my mind away. I'm on the dry side and almost 50 years old so I do have some fine lines, but this didn't accentuate my pores nor my fine lines. The shade match was perfect and it went on very smooth with the applicator which came with it. I put some concealer on my dark spot and put this powder on top and it did warm up a bit and it still looked like my skin, without needing too much a setting mist!! It will be my go to!
I gave a 4 star since it is pricey and it will be nice if they sold extra applicators separately. If I used a large powder brush, it did have some fall outs. * At first I thought I had chosen the wrong shade. I did what the ND website said and based my choice on my skin tone in indirect daylight. That shade is significantly paler than my skin in artificial light. 

When I applied the powder, it looked so white on me I felt like I was cosplaying a French aristocrat. I sprayed myself with setting spray and hoped for the best. 10-20 minutes later, the makeup was no longer chalky white. It matched my skin tone perfectly. 

I have oily skin, and this foundation doesn't separate as much as other foundations do after eight hours. It looks like my skin, and it feels like im wearing no makeup at all! It doesnt even feel like I'm wearing makeup when I touch my face! This foundation definitely lives up to its price.

I will say, it definitely seems like it was designed with dry sponges and powder puffs in mind. When I applied it with a powder brush, it was very easy to layer too much on an area with my brushstrokes. I guess I'm used to sheer to medium powders, not medium to heavy. * please make a liquid foundation"

The only dislike is the applicator. If not careful its really easy to make a mess. It also could be improved as to not waste as much product * i first tried this in April 2024 & have gone through 2 bottles. i do like how it evens out my skin tone (i have redness around my cheeks) but i have noticed it becomes orange throughout the day. i'm doing my research on what to wear prior to applying but for now i'm taking a pause on using * I would purchase again. * I would buy a hundred times over, great lightweight coverage. * Really good everyday foundation, medium coverage. * First time using and so far it blends in and makes my skin feel smooth. Doesn't cake up in my lines (I'm 71). Doesn't give much coverage and still too early to tell if the product is improving skin. Ulta advertised a free gift but then didn't send it! * I returned the first shade for a lighter one, even though I love the glotion darker color!! It's creamy maybe even a tad cakey or more coverage.

The foundation doesn't set or oxidized * Its nothing lile it says, shades are way off and it burnt my skin plus it stinks. It doesn't cover very well it's more sheer and streaky * This is a good full coverage, matte foundation. A little bit of product goes a long way. If you a more natural look, you can mix it with a moisturizer. The smell might be a bit off putting, but it's not bad. The only con is it is expensive. * I am a ride or die ELF girl, and I seldom try other brands because of it. But I've been hearing a ton about this product, and had a gift card so I wanted to give it a try. I am really impressed. The converage is really a stand out for me. I'm always trying to cover redness around my chin, purples under my eyes, and minor acne scarring, one layer of this leaves me completley smooth, and porcelin like. Blushes and bronzers blend seamlessly. My only gripe is for some reason I can't find a concealer that doesn't pill with it, whether under the foundation, or over. But honestly, you almost dont need concealer with this unless you're highlighting certain areas. All and all, I totally recommend and will be purchasing again :) * Couldn't be happier with this foundation. I normally struggle with my makeuo separating or coming off throughout the day but this foundation didnt budge! * I would definitely recommend if you want true full coverage. Im nearing 50 and I have no problems with this settling into lines or accentuating my pores. I use a BHA exfoliant prior and with this my skin looks flawless!"
43,it cosmetics,your skin but better foundation + skincare,pimprod2017112,2568683," * I love this foundation, it is very lightweight so I had to use a heavy moisturizer and thick primer. It worked well with both NYX and Provedence drugstore primers.

Also my deep skin discoloration are covered with a tiny amount. I use liquid bronzer and blush with it and it pairs well with Pacifica and Maybelline liquid products. Once this foundation dries on your skin, it will break up if you add liquid or oil makeup on top- but as long as I do it all at one it sets the makeup and last for my work day. 

FYI I set my face with pixi skin veil and it wasn't too drying on my dry skin. They recommended I get a shade lighter foundation to cover and it gave me full coverage. The only con is my local Ulta doesn't sell it so I have to buy online. * this is so watery I don't even know how you're supposed to apply it. I wore it for one day and within a few hours started developing a severe rash on my skin that has lasted for several days. would not recommend. * I'm obsessed with this foundation! You don't feel like you are wearing anything! It's life changing! * This is actually a first… I've never experienced a foundation that manages to be extremely watery, yet also cakey at the same time. Unsure what kind of mystery this is, because it's certainly not a good one. Color was also extremely off and orange. Also more on the natural matte side, NOT radiant like it says. * This foundation does exactly what it says,"" Your skin but better"". Absolutely love this foundation. * I wanted to try a light product, but once i applied it, it was a weird textire. I already have oily skin so it made my face very shiny, which was not what i wanted.

It makes my face look too dark in some spots. Although I've had to find a different setting powder to pair with it, the foundation itself still looks flawless. * Absolutely love this foundation!

Also, we can last all day. * I love using this particular foundation for my face, as I find it helps hides my wrinkles, brown spots, but is not caked on, like some other brands I have used in the past. There are many shades to choose from, and I am happy with my results. * This foundation covers evenly and is easy to apply.  The color works well with my skin.  Very pleased with this purchase. * As someone in my 40s, I've tried countless foundations, and the Laura Mercier Real Flawless Weightless Waterproof Foundation is one of the best for its lightweight, natural finish. I apply it with a brush, and it blends seamlessly into my skin, creating a smooth, even base with minimal effort. A little goes a long way—just a small amount delivers excellent coverage without feeling heavy. However, I've noticed it's not ideal for oily skin, as it can break down throughout the day in shinier areas. For normal to dry skin types, though, this is a game-changer! * This stuff never seems to dry, it goes on terribly, breaks up and slides all over my face.  I had high hopes, I loved the discontinued LM foundation.   This isnt it though. * I gave this away. I used to use the crème foundation and loved it. This foundation is thin, sits on the top of your skin, doesn't blend and feels cheap. I won't be purchasing this again and have moved on to try a completely different brand."

I will use this in the summer as it's a bit dark for me at the moment. * So I think I picked the wrong shade. It's a tad bit darker than my skin complexion but this was very easy to apply. I used the brush that came with it and it evened out the product perfectly on me without having to use my hands. Once settled it looked good and even look. I thought this was nice especially since I typically go for tinted moisturizer. * Love the coverage and the blendability of this product ! I got a shade a little too dark for me right now so I mixed with a little lighter of one j have.  And it blended awesome. It will be perfect for summer. * This stuff is very nice and covers quite well. It's moisturizing and I love that it has spf 50!! * This is my holy grail product I love IT cosmetics ! This is a product I don't want to be without- I think it's perfect . For day to day I want something that has sunscreen and has full coverage but also skin benefits and this has all of that ! It also looks very natural on the skin -  this is one of my holy grail products ! * I've fallen in love with this cc cream! It's the perfect shade. I love how lightweight yet full coverage this product is. A little bit really does go a long way and lasts all day long.

Not for problematic skin coverage. * This is my favorite ""foundation"" but I do struggle with it. It can be patchy on dry skin and it does not mesh well with most of my moisturizers. However, even on bad application days, a couple hours later I'm always amazed by how amazing my skin looks. * This goes on light and smooth. Gives nice coverage when you want to look natural. Has SPF 30. * I needed a replacement for my favorite Les Beiges tinted SPF moisturizer by Chanel, which was discontinued :(. An ULTA assistant pointed me in the direction of Laura Mercier's tinted moisturizer with SPF, which has been great (I'm on my third tube—each has lasted me about 9 months with daily use). I like how this product lightly balances out redness, gives a subtle glow, doesn't bother my skin, and is breathable. * I'm very picky when it comes to base makeup. I have dry/normal skin, a light-medium olive skintone, and I deal with dullness/discoloration. Shade 2N1 is a good shade match for me. I've enjoyed using this with a dense foundation brush. It's easy to sheer out or build up. I would describe it as light/medium coverage. It evens out my skin tone, but doesn't cover blemishes. Its very comfortable on the skin, it feels like a moisturizer, the consistency is thick at first, but it doesn't feel like anything when blended out. I can wear it without powder and it stays on all day for me. Definitely repurchasing. * I've been using this product for years!  I don't like thick heavy coverage so this is very light buildable coverage.  I have pretty good skin, 38 years old, cheeks are pink from dryness with few blemishes and this provides me full coverage.  I do add a thin layer of moisturizer (especially now that I'm older and less oily) and concealer for under my eyes, nose and any glaring blemishes.  It's a very natural finish that does pull warm.  I use 2N1 for my winter everyday color and 2W1 for summer when I'm tanned (it's very yellow/gold). * The Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer goes on nicely,  bur doesnt cover ANY imperfections.

I gave me great flawless coverage. * I got colored match by one of the associates and she was amazing. Her name was Humaira, She picked the first color and I absolutely loved the way it blended so smoothly and the new formula is like a soft look and you can cake it and it'll still look smooth. * This is the best foundation I've used in years!

Has a divine scent! * Loving this foundation! Have tried many over the years and as I have aged I have had to become pickier in what I'm using. 

This foundation is excellent for women who ate experiencing wrinkles, oiliness, uneven skin, etc. I have some wrinkles, extreme oily skin, break outs, and skin disorders. This covers everything and stays perfectly in place all day! It does NOT settle in wrinkles! It is buildable! Easy to apply! 

Throwing out my MAC and Clinique and keeping Chanel!

Do not buy! * I was expecting a little more coverage but does feel like skin. It looks beautiful but on acne days not even with a few layers it doesn't add to much coverage. * I'm so impressed by this foundation and have told all my friends about it. My skin looks incredible with it on and it applies so nicely, very light but great coverage! I dont even wear concealer with it! I put on a light moisturizer (I use Caudalie vinoperfect) and then apply the foundation with a brush. 5 stars!!! * This may be the worst foundation I've ever tried; I could not get this to apply correctly-i tried a brush, sponge and my fingers-there was just no applying this stuff. It was somewhat watery but I could not get it to spread on my face-i don't think I've ever had that happen with a foundation.  I wish I could give it 0 stars. * Looks very nice on * The best!"

Under it I wear estee advanced night repair serum, peptide eye cream, cocokind electrolyte cream, gel sunscreen, and loreal lumi glotion. Love the brush. Worried about keeping it hygienic but thinking an occasional dainty wash or spraying alcohol on it will suffice * So soft and creamy and perfect for light make up days, or to cover spots. * I really want to love this foundation!  The foundation itself is great!  The brush is ridiculous!  It's too tapered to blur well and too stiff to blend around eyes and nose.  The cap for the brush end doesn't stay on either.  It's very annoying!  Also when you wind up the stick to apply, it doesn't lock in place.  It instantly rolls back down.  It is so weird—maybe I just got a bad one…?

But if I were to rate on the foundation, I would give it a solid 4 maybe even 5 stars.  It goes on easily, the color matches perfectly and stays put all day!  I've been using it alternatively with dior and merit stick foundations to see which I like best and the Lancome would probably win if it wasn't for the poor packaging! * Love it * Big love.

But everytime i take the doe foot applicator out of the bottle it sprinkles liquid foundation everywhere. * I have never been able to find a good match for myself with foundation. I am pale and foundations always pull too yellow or too pink, even with neutral shades. This is the first brand ive come across that offers a fair AND light olive, i gave the fair one a shot and it's a truly perfect match. However, I do have dry skin and it did not give me a lot of time to work it onto my skin without it getting cakey. I am not a fan of the doe foot applicator, both for sanitation reasons AND because i think it contributed to me having less time to work with the product for a smooth base. I would LOVE this shade in either a skin tint or more satin-y finish. * I was looking for a medium coverage foundation with a satin finish for a while. Also, I do not depend on foundation shades to cater to my fair olive skin but this The Performer foundation has it all. I do wish the packaging was a pump instead of an applicator however, that does not takeover the fact that this is a wonderful product. I appreciate the inclusive shade range and the coverage perfect for everyday application. * Im picky about foundation but this medoum coverage is pretty good * Im picky about foundation but this medoum coverage is pretty good * have a light-medium olive skin tone that leans muted and cooler.

I wish there was a lighter shade because this is a bit dark but i mix another foundation with it. * I have dry skin and have been using a pump this either brushed on or patted on with a beauty blender for a year now. I make sure to moisturize and let my sunscreen settle down first, then apply. Sometimes I use the same brush and use sweep it across my under eye and across my lids just to even things out a bit. I am fortunate to have clear skin with very small pores so there isn't a ton to cover other than some redness on my cheeks. The narrow tube with a pump is also fits more easily into a makeup bag than a chunky bottle and I don't worry about dropping and breaking it. I just wish it were a little less expensive or a larger volume for the price. * This foundation is so luminous and has great coverage.   A little goes a long way but it lasts all day. * I've been using Charlotte Tilbury's Beautiful Skin Foundation, and it's seriously a game-changer.

It was so bad, I didn't leave my house for a week! Now I am left with scars on my face that could take years to recover from. I dont know if it's the ethylhexyl salicylate, alcohol, or mystery frangance in this ish, but I wouldn't wish what happened to me on my worst enemy. Dont touch this stuff with a 10 ft pole!!!

I'm trying not to hold it against ""Dior"" or Ulta, but the fact that they're even letting this stuff stay on the market baffles me. Dont use this. * If you have tried the YSL matte foundation and you're looking for a less expensive version this is it! It smells amazing, has the SPF and stays on matte. I live in AZ where if is hot and this does not feel heavy or cakey. * I decided to try this foundation after seeing reviews on YouTube. But it does not live up to the reviews. It is not transfer proof, and it rubs off so easily. If you touch your face, it's smearing. I may have to go back to bare minerals. * The foundation itself is great. It goes on smooth and it last long it is not greasy or oily. The pump keeps clogging, every few days when I dispense it shoots out at angles, it gets on my clothes, and I have to change last minute. It gets on the wall… its very frustrating. It is good make up, but if I am spending this much money, the packaging should be good too."

I tried this product with several different creams, lotions, and primer combinations.  Awful on age skin just awful!!!! * It is a great feel, no shine after a long day, but it doesn't have the medium coverage I am used to. * This foundation is not worth the money at all. It is so drying, no matter how much prep work you put into your under layer. Brush, beauty blender. I have tried it all. Ive tested a million prep layer products and nothing makes this product work. It highlights every crack, dry flake and impurity on your face. The coverage is pretty much nonexistent. And, if you try to build it, you end up looking more dry. Doesnt work with oily skin either, it slides off my face within an hour at work. My maybelline makeup is better than this and costs a fraction of the price. * One of my favorite foundations! Its very coverage, dosnt feel heavy on your skin. Blends very easily but make sure to do it quickly because once it drys its hard to blend. One thing about this foundation is that one it oxidate color can be warmer, i usually recomen a tone higher, that way it will match or be closer to your skin tone! * This is a great option for daily wear. It's light, radiant but not greasy. The color shade was perfect * I bought this becaus of the great reviews but I'm quite disappointed. I've tried a lot of foundations and this will be at the bottom of my list. If you plan on wearing it for an hour or two, sure. However, it creases terribly.

I returned it and got SkinBetter Science Tone Smart Sunscreen Lotion instead which is a little pricier, but worth it! if you're looking for a creamy skin tint without sacrificing the glow, and you want a little sun protection, that's my recommendation! * I wanted a tinted moisturizer that I could use for weekend days that maybe I'm just running a few errands and don't want to do full makeup application.  This is perfect.  It isn't full coverage but blurs enough and moisturizes great.  I use this, a swipe of lipgloss, a bit of mascara and I'm out the door. * Would definitely buy again! It is very skin like and doesn't make my dry patches more noticeable! best application is with a foundation brush, but you can always use your hands, either works! Will say it doesn't play well with one of my cream blushes, and smudges, but it could be user error so take that with a pinch of salt. All in all havent had any major issues yet. * Applies easily. No streaks. Glowing skin (Not too glowy). Have been compliments on my makeup since I've been using it. * I really wanted to like this. When using it, my fave broke out. * I have dry skin and this skin tint feels very natural and hydrating on. The coverage is on the lighter side so it doesn't cover all imperfections.

I'd only refer it to a friend with the warning about poor ability to close it and keep the pump sanitary. * I liked this foundation a lot! It matched my skin tone really well, and is a really affordable price. It's a nice size, and usually lasts me over four months to finish. The only bad thing is that it takes a while to blend in and I find myself having to go over it with a beauty blender or brush a lot. I do still really like it though and it covers up many imperfections. * The best foundation ever!!!!!! * Patchy, greasy , I was disappointed ☹️ * Great price so, I thought to give it a try. It's not a bad foundation but not one that squeals excitement. Blends pretty well but after a while it seems to pool into lines and makes imperfections noticeable.

If you want full coverage, you need to add layers, but if you have large pores, it will enhance them. * I absolutely love this foundation! I have very oily skin and tend to stay away from liquid foundations, even ones for oily skin, cause theyball just melt off. I read the description on this one and decided to give it a try and im so happy i did. It stays on all day and when i wore it during a 14 mile run- IT DID NOT BUDGE. I will definitely be buying this again. * I have never loved a foundation as passionately, as I love this. I have struggled for so long to find a foundation that match as well to my light olive undertone. And dear God, does this foundation just melt into my skin. Not only is the color absolutely stunning for me personally but I honestly forget I'm wearing make up at all which I feel like is something that a lot of foundations claim but almost none actually follow through with. As the title says if urban decay ever gets rid of this foundation, I will personally start a picket line. 😅 * Initially bought the foundation because l'll be traveling soon and needed something that came in a plastic bottle. Packaging is 10/10. Love the squeeze bottle and how its so compact

When wearing the foundation without primer, formula made my skin greasy and dry at the same time and i started to feel it on my face throughout the day. For reference, i have combination skin that runs more dry

With primer, good medium coverage matte finish that resembles a powder formula when dry. I also feel it less on my face through the day. 

Overall, foundation didnt change my life but overall recommend for travel * I have oily skin, no acne. Even with primers, after 4hrs this separates on my face. I wanted to love it because it feels amazingly lighweight on skin when i rub it im with my fingertips. I have a few whiteheads on my cheek from oily mess on skin while at work."

It blends so well, I have oily, textured, fuzzy haired skin and always stayed away from powder foundations, until I couldn't take the oily mess from liquid foundations anymore and gave this one a try! My eyes are very sensitive, and I was baffled my how much I loved this foundation. I apply over my moisturizer and lasts all day.

Only cons: can't color match at Ulta stores, and a bit pricey - but so worth it! * I've used this makeup for years. I love that it is light buildable coverage with SPF protection. * It goes on very smooth and covers well. It doesn't give me any reactions all day like it's not even there. Most others I'm itching or just want to take it off mid day. * Love this foundation.  I have tried three different colors and they all work.  The lightest one I use in the Winter.  This is so easy to apply and looks great on.  To set, which really helps with a powder foundation, I just mist with water.  The refillable compact is great too. * Yall. Name a skin type…i have it. Lol. But serously this beautiful powder is by far the best powder foundation i have ever tried and i have tried nearly all of them. You can sheer it out for a set or finish or pack it on for a full coverage moment. All wirhout looking dry or cakey. It is the first powder i don't immediately reach for a setting spray to ""melt"" it. You can. But you dont have to. This conpany is also on my good list for being loudly and proudly prochoice. Love it. * I'm a powder foundation junky. I hate liquid foundation so much. So I always use powder foundation. The reason I LOVE this foundations are 1) long lasting wear 2) doesn't look cakey at all 3) but still has great coverage without looking heavy 4) color matches my skin tone very well. I have tried from cheap to high end ones and I say this is one of the best. I have one more favorite but I'm keeping it as my beauty secret! * I'm in my late 30s and was looking for a powder that wouldn't sink into my fine lines, and lasted. This was not it. The coverage is too transparent, so you have to use a lot of get better coverage, and then it doesn't have any staying power. Maybe it's my skin or my primer that doesn't work well with it, but for the price I wasn't impressed."

Good selection of colors to match anyone. * I loved how this felt on my dry skin and it didn't seem to clog my acne-prone skin, but I am a very pale person with very neutral undertones. All of the shades either make me look yellow and somehow too dark or make me look even paler, even if its a darker shade due to the undertones. It also didn't last as long as I wish it did for the price point, but it's Dior so I can't complain. As long as you aren't the color of like a cracker this would probably work just not for the super pale, not yellow or pink girlies. * I am not one to stray from my usual makeup routine. However, turning 50 has made me change it up. My Ulta consultant talked me into trying this foundation. I am so glad she did. Does not look cakey and does not seem to settle into my fine lines like my last one did. This will be my go to from now on. * I am not a pro with makeup, but after trying a few other products this was my favorite and used for my wedding. It did not disappoint either! Had me feeling like I was glowing, smooth application and gives the picture perfect glow look. Not too much, but just enough! Blended very well and gave me the extra boost of confidence on my big day! You do not need a whole lot either so it lasted me over a month almost 2 and I was wearing about everyday. * I have used/ tried every foundation. This is by far the best. It doesn't sit in fine lines, keeps me glowing. All is really need is half a pump. I use the concealer too in a shade lighter * Great foundation! * As someone who lives in a dry area so my skin is constantly dry, this foundation worked so well with me! I absolutely loved it! Only downside is that I think I got the wrong shade because I look orange lol but i still love it! btw this foundation has a slight floral scent!"
68,anastasia beverly hills,"medium coverage, natural finish luminous foundation",pimprod2008586,2551421," * This is one of my go to foundations for the winter when i get a little paler and a lot dryer. It has amazing buildable coverage, applies nicely, and its one of the few that i can find a true color match in. 
HOWEVER, this needs new packaging. The twist on lid with the pump applicator? Trash. Its always loose, pumps out inconsistent amounts of product and quite frankly for the price point i shouldnt have to worry about that. I cant even travel with it without it spilling in my makeup case…like whats the point if i cant bring it with me when i go out of town?
It honestly needs the new bottle that her new foundation just got (the matte one?) and maybe just have a glossy bottle? 
What do i know im just a consumer 😭😭
Still love the actual product though. * Your cool under tones has to much yellow under tones.. need to make it without adding golden or beige into the mixer never have been able to find a match that didn't look to yellow on me. * I hardly write reviews but this is review worthy. I have acne prone skin.  I also have drier skin as well. I read where people say it's too thin or too heavy. Honestly, it depends on how you build it up. it is build able coverage. If you're seeing texture and fine lines, be sure to set it with powder. Brush the powder off, and finish with a spray. The morphe luminous setting spray pairs like a DREAM. This is the only foundation I will buy ever. If I had the money I'd buy like 10 back ups just incase. I moisturize, prime, conceal, foundation, powder set, set spray. This is how I would layer it. Not including blush, bronzer, contour, etc. Even with added layers I don't believe it's heavy. It very much gives, skin. Because this is infused with skin loving ingredients I can wear this all day. I'm talking a full 12+ hours. Gym, errands, everything and it holds up beautiful. It actually looks better over time. It almost melts into my skin more and just looks even more natural by the end of the night. IT DOES NOT OXIDIZE!! 🥰 There's so many good things I can say about this. My cons, the pump. Over time the pump does stick. That needs worked on. I've bought probably 10 bottles and they all do it over the course of 2 years so I'd say it's for sure the design of the pump. but the formula is worth it but be mindful it can get messy if you don't pull the pump back up. This is worth your money 100% regardless. sometimes we avoid wearing makeup because our skin is broken out, but I actually wear this when I'm breaking out because I swear when I wash it off I feel like my skin is better. * The shade match is amazing but every time Ive tried this foundation it left me feeling horrible about how I look. Ive spent a long time trying tk make this work in MANY different ways, used almost the entire bottle over time because its my backup ""emergency"" foundation. No matter what, my face looks caked and it settles in horribly. No matter how you spin it, it does not look like skin in real life. * The search for the one is over. Great dewy buildable coverage that stays in place, and can be mattified with a powder. A perfect shade match too! * The search for the one is over.

ONLY con is I have to order my shade online, Ulta doesn't carry in store, what's up with that?! * This was a really great substitute for Clinique Even Better Glow. Has such a beautiful finish and is so smooth! I hope they never discontine! * It's so great that Tarte has vegan products because I have a mammal allergy and have to have all vegan products. Thank you! * This foundation is moisturizing and provides good coverage. I like the color, although I did get help from one of the employees at Ulta. It's a good match for my skin. It's a bit shiny so I do need to use powder, but when I do, it gives my face a nice glow."
70,tula,radiant skin brightening serum skin tint spf 30,pimprod2032850,2598954," * It's works wonders I don't have to wear foundation with it I look great covers everything and has sunscreen * It's not for my skin. Looks awful on my face * I'm shade 01 (the lightest shade) and it's the first time in my life that I found a foundation that actually works for me, and is my exact shade!
Blends like a dream- and looks so natural. I could cry! NEVER STOP MAKING THIS! A little goes a long way! * I stopped wearing foundation because of how it made my skin look and feel. I immediately fell in love with this product. I love how you can do a full face of make up or just add a little bit of color to your face with your skin care and still have your freckles showing. * As someone who used to wear heavy foundation that turned orange and always oxidized, this is my new favorite product. This skin tint is amazing and makes your skin so glowy and gorgeous. Ive gotten so many compliments when I go to work. * I have been searching for a light foundation or tinted moisturizer that didn't leave my cheeks dry. This stuff is absolutely amazing. Leaves me with the dewy, moisturized look I've been wanting! * If youre looking for a glowy full coverage foundation this is the one!"
71,mac,studio fix fluid spf15 24hr matte foundation + oil control,pimprod2044825,2622175," * This new formula is so incredibly disappointing. It has to be the worst high end foundation I've ever used. I cannot understand why Mac changed it because they had to be aware of how bad it looked. It's cakey, it looks like sand settled on your face, sits in all lines and creases and makes you look about 10 years older, separates, it's super greasy, very light coverage now, and transfers all over the place! Just an awful, frustrating, disappointing product. I've moved on to another brand after 15 years of loyalty to Mac because the foundations they are offering now are not the Mac quality they once were. * Thanks to Maggie frm Ulta in Fort Lauderdale for taking the time to find the right foundation shade for me. * My shade in the original Studio Fix is no longer the same shade, so I had to get remached. While trying on shades, I noticed the foundation looked and felt different. I asked for a sample instead of purchasing an entire bottle. I'm glad I did because from that sample, I realized how awful the new formula is! I was able to wear it 4 times from the sample jar and all 4 times I absolutely hated it! I can not describe the frustration and anxiety it put me through as I used different skin preps, techniques and touch ups through out the day to try to get it to look good, but it just looked awful! It made me look ashy, wrinkly, oily and chalky dry! Every time I looked in the mirror I just wanted to wash it off of my face!  Who brainwashed Mac into thinking this is a better product than their original!? The remaining foundation in the sample jar went straight to the garbage where it belongs! I will not be spending a single cent on this. Mac has lost my money, I'm moving on to another brand. * The formula change nightmare started a few months ago for me. I went to buy a new bottle of the original Studio Fix and had to get the new reformulated one. I cannot understand why Mac ruined it. It's absolutely terrible, it feels and looks like greasy, chalky sand on my face. It moves and separates all over looking terribly cakey, it transfers onto everything at the slightest touch and settles into all lines and wrinkles. It's just bad, bad, bad! I've been looking elsewhere for a new foundation and have come across a few that will work decently, but nothing like the original Studio Fix. I keep going back to Mac and trying this new formula with different skin preps only to be frustrated by the fact that nothing makes it look better, it makes my skin look awful every single time I wear it. Makeup is not supposed to be this difficult and frustrating, it's supposed to make you look good, and Mac had THE best and only foundation to do that and they decided to completely ruin it. I hope they catch on quickly and bring back the original Studio Fix. * I wore the original formula for years and would always receive compliments that my skin was flawless; people couldn't even tell that I had on foundation. The new formula is terrible on my skin. Coverage isn't as good, & it has a drying and aging effect that sucks any bit of youthfulness out of my face. Literally ages my face. It's just bad. I don't need the fragrance they added, nor the pump. I'll gladly trade both features for the original, reliable formula that blended so well. Having to look for a new foundation brand takes much time. * Great coverage and color * I bought a bottle of this foundation.The sales girls raved about this Mac foundation and how it was reformulated and how it was the best and that I would absolutely love it. I tried it for a few days of wear and could not, for the life of me, understand what I was supposed to love, exactly. It settled on all my fine lines, it creased terribly, it looked cakey, chalky after a few hours, and it felt dry with an greasy under layer as the foundation sat on top of my skin. Nothing I tried made it look better, it was honestly frustrating. It was so bad! I'm baffled at how anyone could like this. I do not recommend this foundation, all you'll get out of it is terrible looking skin and frustration. I've never returned make up, I returned this one."
72,l'orÃ©al,infallible 24h fresh wear foundation in a powder,pimprod2021871,2575170," * I love this product it makes me feel confident cause I know it's going to last me all day. * I love this product. I love the way it covers spots I want it too, love the way it feels on my face not to heavy just light. * I apply using a loose foundation brush to pat it all over, building coverage where I want it. I do think applying it with the sponge that comes with it is too much and I need full coverage in some areas. It feels cakey and heavy with sponge. Using brush it goes on in much lighter layers giving a more natural even matte appearance. I like a dewey appearance in some areas and more matte in others and this works with brush application to hide melasma and some uneven skin tone and pores. It lasts most of the day pretty well even with some heavy sweating during summer. * I've been wearing this for probably a solid 10 years and will continue to wear it until they don't make it anymore or until I keel over, lol! Great price great coverage great product! * I love this compact. The product works so well on top of foundation or on its own. It was my go to powder until i had startrd swimming. I have 4 different shades and not one works 330 is a tad too dark, but 300 is too light. 260 and 250 are currently too light, but are for when im not swimming * This is definitely one of the better pressed powder foundations out there.  It applies smoothly and looks natural, and shockingly i found a great color match (golden sun, im normally mac nc42-45 depending on the season).  Tips for application: start with properly moisturized skin.  I found using the included puff (or similar) AND using gentle pressure (dont drag it) to swipe and pat product in the skin provides best coverage.  Then use a brush if necessary to even it out.  Apply other powder product over it, and use a setting spray to finish and it should not look powdery/dry.  My only issue is staying power, but that is a problem i have with face products across the board (i tend to touch my face, blow my nose a lot throughout the day) * I started buying this since the other brand I was using has raised their prices so much. I don't plan on going back! The reason for 4 stars is it runs out fast."
73,chanel,les beiges water-fresh tint,pimprod2030055,2574253," * I have acne prone skin, and this water fresh tint does not clog pores! It makes your skin glowing and soft, great for cold dry winters. I use the wster fresh touch in the summer for less hydration on humid days and a bit more coverage in the summer! LOVE 
Its a but pricey but you only need a drop for your whole face, and I wait until I have enough points to get it discounted or Free! 😊 * I got a gift card and bought this as an indulgence. Let me start by saying it is very sheer and will not cover any flaws. However, I wanted something for little to know makeup days so I could look alive and this makes skin look absolutely radiant. With a setting spray, it stayed that way all day. * It is light. The coverage was perfect for me. * Love this product so much, I would by it again * This is a dream product. It covers just enough to even out skin tone and provide a healthy glow. It looks like my skin. * When I say I've tried a lot of different skin tints, I'm not exaggerating. Ive tried everything from fenty, chantecaille, YSL, Tower 28, caliray, tula, etc.
There is NOTHING like this product. It is truly one of a kind. Its sheer but somehow stays all day. Has a gorgeous finish and is a true no makeup-makeup staple. * This is the first product I've found that works on my aged skin. Blends beautifully, looks pretty natural and DOES NOT show my small lines and deep wrinkles any worse.  Because it's super moisturizing some of my lines actually look better. The longer the day does, the better it sets. Love this product."

This makes my skin look so good and fresh! * Love my Clinique foundation. Also love the packaging! At first I thought it was so different from my past foundation packaging, but absolutely love the convenience and ease of using the tube that just fits in your hand! * I must admit that I didn't expect to like this foundation, but I did purchase it because I don't know how to say no thank you.  When I got home my husband complimented me.  He thought I looked so rested and refreshed!  What ???  I've been wearing this foundation for two weeks now and have gotten compliments on my complexion from total strangers!  Why not give it a try. * Goes on easily, blends perfectly. Slightly lighter than my normal color so I mix them. * It took me years to find a good color match foundation that also plays well with my mostly dry but still combo skin. I LOVE this foundation! I do have to make sure I use a moisturizer, primer, and setting spray, but when i do, it goes on amazing and looks and feelz natural all day long. The perfect mid coverage for dry skin. Don't know what some of these reviews are saying…it does not oxidize (you just have the wrong shade) and it's definitely not chalky. * I like using this foundation.  Great coverage , yet feels light on my skin.  I have been using it for a few years."

They have such a great selection of colors that I found a perfect, natural match. * I will buy this again and again.  My original makeup Dermablend was not available from the company so some ladies helped me find this and it's amazing!!! It feels like heaven on my face light and it gives great coverage. * Do NOT use the AI foundation match. It's incorrect and Ulta sent me the wrong shade (literally orange). I had to go in store to correct it due to being locked out of my account and Ulta refusing to let me access it over the phone.The product itself is good, Ulta online is horrible. * I used to have this when I worked at Ulta and repurchased it after decluttering.  I forgot how good it looks. * please keep in mind that I am working on my skincare game, so my issues might be related to poor skincare. 
Coverage is AMAZING! I do some odd pilling on the upper lip and in between the eyebrows, but after setting spray it's not as noticeable. you do need setting powder ALL OVER to make sure NOTHING comes off, otherwise you might have issues. Still feels very nice on the skin. I discovered for myself at least you need to be careful with application and with brushes, you need to apply very lightly lest you deal with streaks and pachieness. Beauty blenders are pretty safe, do NOT apply with your hands I tried and I got random heavy coverage patches and some areas I went over got no coverage. I will continue to purchase as it is hydrating, less damaging to my skin than most I have tried, light weight, and covers all my acne spot and redness from my cpap."

It is perfect in texture and it gives me an awesome glow yet very natural. Please don't ever discontinue this product, it is awesome and it is my forever foundation cosmetic. * I went into Ulta to buy my NARS Macao and a manager encouraged me to try a couple other colors she thought would be a better fit for a brown girl with warm, yellow undertones. B130 was a flawless match. Highly reccomend * I'm so glad i went ahead and bought this, it is so pretty on the skin and feels like nothing. Its covers what i need it to, and blends in seamless. * This foundation is one of my top foundations to wear. It is glowy and melts into the skin beautifully. I haven't found a single problem, it has worked well with other products, I will continue to buy it for sure! * Looks and feels like my skin I get so many compliments on this foundation when I wear it.

I would highly recommend this product * This product is amazing"

I used to be a matte girl because of my super oily skin but as I've gotten older i have too many lines and crepes for that to look good anymore. Couple that with the fact that everything makes me break out and it's impossible to find a good match until this! This strikes the balance between dewy and matte so I have a youthful glow without looking like a grease slick. It lasts well if I set it with powder and I love that it works as concealer too. The dual purpose applicator is great. The fact that it goes by undertone makes the color match the best i have found. I haven't had issues with breakouts either! Perfection! * It moves and settles into the creases around my eyes and shows every pore. I hate it. * I have been using this foundation for years. It was recommended by someone at Ulta. I try other foundations out there just to see if there is a better one and I always end uo back at this one. I tried the Estee Lauder double wear just because everyine raved and it did not look or stay any longer or better than this one so returned it and went back to this. Love this foundation. Its overall a great one! * I honestly loved this so much like i love it and i feels like i don't have anything on.Its so light weight and it has such a beautiful finish but unfortunately it broke me out. * I looooove this foundation. I've seen other reviews talking about it being cakey and other negative things but if you know how to properly prep your face before applying foundation (this applies to ANY foundation) then you will LOVE this brand. I have Very sensitive skin and hate the feel of foundation on my face but I don't mind this one at all! You get a full coverage and it's lightweight. I've been using this brand for a year and I'm truly impressed. * I love this foundation i just which the shades would expand in store. The coverage and longevity is insane. I have replaced my double wear with this foundation. It's cheaper and better. I love how the wand is on the inside so that i can use it also as a concealer…Also there is primer and skincare in this foundation!!! * I really need a gluten free foundation, and this isn't worth the money. Like others have said, it looks cakey. Somehow it LOOKS dry, but it slides right off like it's an oil. Settled into every freaking line and ended up looking like bad Halloween makeup. I will give it one more chance - going to try it without moisturizer underneath, because it was hard to wash off the back of my hand. If it still sucks, it's getting returned."
81,nars,light reflecting advanced skincare foundation,pimprod2030141,2591148," * Seems to match my skin well. Always have that problem finding a foundation that will match up to my skin just right. I have only used a few times. I only got it a few days ago. Not enough time to review it. Price, I guess is good. Other places had it cheaper. I have a Ulta card. So that is where I buy my makeup products. So far I like it. * I put everyone onto this foundation and they love it and have started to use it * I love this foundation, but many of the light shades lean yellow. If they were truer to neutral and cool, I would definitely repurchase this foundation. * I LOVE this foundation!!! Tried many other brands (prestige & common) and this is the only one that works for my skin! I'm 39 with dry/combo skin, and I've NEVER had an issue with coverage or buildability. I use NYX Marshmellow Primer, then apply foundation with a sponge, and finish with setting spray. Good to go, all day! * made a switch from silicone-base to water-base, and this product was life changing. I still love my MAC studio fix but this is giving it. Run for its money!

I love Chanel and love some of their other foundation, but not this one. * I've been wearing this for 4 years and will never buy another.

I have acne scars very large pores deep smile lines that collect the makeup.... And I'm 53. All the nightmares!!!!  This foundation!!!  I mean common!!!  It covered everything!  It blurred the pores on my nose, which nothing ever has, it didn't settle it those deep lines, even the ones in the corner of my mouth!!!  I looked Dewey all day!  I felt like I was wearing nothing. It wasn't even the right shade cause they were out but I just used a bit of bronzer and omg perfection!!  I will never ever use anything else.

This foundation goes on so smooth. * Packaging and scent was nice but the product left an orange tint on my face. It was good coverage and it felt nice on my skin, just not for me. Probably best for tanner people * I find this product is too thick. Its too hard to spread and even takes a bit of effort to squeeze it out of the tube. I want my makeup to be speedy and I find myself not enjoying using it because of this. I also think for a tinted moisturizer, it should be thinner. * I've used this product everyday for YEARS. I can wear it for everyday use for light coverage, or I can easily build it on my skin for a special event. Blurs and smooths, love that it has spf. I will purchase this literally FOREVER. Must have!! * I have been looking at this for a while and finally got it. I love this. I have mature dry skin This stays put without my skin feeling dry. Doesn't accentuate my lines. Not greasy shiny more of a satin finish . * The colors/shades are way darker than others. I use it on my neck and it blends great there. It's pricy for what it is though especially per oz. I wouldn't recommend because of those factors. * This product dulled my skin. The color matched perfectly and a little product was all that was needed for coverage. However, this made my dry skin flake, beaded up, and did NOT provide the glow I expected. Disappointed because I had looked at this product for a long time thinking it would provide the dewy glow my dry skin craves."
84,polite society,more than a pretty face skin-caring foundation,pimprod2040619,2615146," * For transparency, I received a bottle of the Polite Society More Than a Pretty Face Skin Caring Foundation as a free gift with purchase. I had low expectations because lately any liquid type of foundation isn't my preferred method. I had read many reviews that mentioned the tones being on the yellow or darker side so this added to my trepidation. But being free I wasn't going to pass it up and picked a tone that I thought would work for me.

Surprisingly it's a perfect match. I also like the texture of the product. It goes on easily with a foundation brush and coverage is better than I expected too. Had no problems with it settling into fine lines either. Wasn't greasy nor drying for me. The color I used is Very Light Neutral.

I don't know if I'd buy it again because a)  I prefer stick or powder foundation but overall I think this is better for my needs than several other products I have in my rotation and b) the packaging is terrible as most people are mentioning. It's an awkward shape and the cap is difficult to take off especially for those of us with aging hands. I feel that for the price the entire item should work including the bottle and pump. * I was hoping this foundation would be great after seeing people use it on tiktok, im 47 and have combo skin.  The shades are way to orange or way too white,  it caked into my wrinkles and came apart within 10 minutes after i applied it. Do not like the feel its heavy for a medium coverage. Do not recommend * I'm a foundation girlie and have tried a ton. I absolutely love this formula. This would be a10/10 for me if it weren't for the packaging. The bottle looks cute but the downside is the pump is horrible it went out before the foundation was even half way gone. * I'm actually shocked. I got this for free as a diamond gift and its quickly become my favorite foundation… even better than my Haus Labs! Which is saying a lot. The pump is mediocre but the product is so beautiful and natural looking. Received so many compliments on my skin since wearing it! * I had never heard of this foundation until Ulta offered it during the Platinum days. I loved Smashbox Studio Skin and I am so disappointed that it has been discontinued. I have been looking for something similar, and for free, I figured I would try this, even with mixed reviews. I absolutely love it. I am 43 with combo skin, leaning more towards oily. My main issue is redness, without any fine lines or texture issues. I noticed the colors were all pretty light, but I ordered fair light based on the color reccomended online, and it is a perfect match. One pump covers my whole face and it lasts all day after setting once with setting powder. it doesn't get oily or oxidize. It's a medium  coverage that makes my skin look flawless. I am shocked by how many complaints I have received. I feel like it is very thin  and you have to work quickly to blend it in,or you could have streaks. I've been using a beauty blender. with a brush coverage would be more full coverage than I am looking for. I definitely recommend, doesn't turn orange or cause oily skin for me. I am happy that a free gift turned into my new favorite foundation. I hope this helps at least one other person! * I have dry skin and wasn't expecting anything from this as it was an Ulta Diamond gift - it is now my new favorite foundation. I've never experienced the whole ""this foundation looks like skin"" until I tried this. It looks flawless but also offers coverage. It's pretty liquidy so I have to powder, and it even looks great under my other products. I'm so impressed. I don't even care for my other foundations now. It's perfect. So grateful for Ulta. I never would've tried this otherwise. I absolutely love it. * I have dry leaning normal, mature skin, applied over Glow Recipe Niaminicide drops. This covered and built well over my redness, high medium leaning full coverage while maintaining a light thinish consistency. It doesnt blur, my wrinkles and pores were still there. It self set and looked a smidge dry. Had I powdered, it would have been bad. I used cream contour and blush, it didnt disturb it and they wore as normal. At the end of the day I did have some product gathered in my smile and forehead wrinkle and it had worn away completely on my chin and was breaking up on my cheeks. I loved the coverage and maybe with the right base/primer it would work but as a less is more makeup girl, I'll pass. I dont want to apply 3 to 4 extra layers to ""make it work""."

87,morphe,lightform extended hydration foundation,pimprod2043869,2621366," * Pretty coverage but this does not stay on the face. Rubs off everywhere. * This foundation oxidizes very well. Typically foundations will blend well and then after they oxidize, they look completely different and not in a good way. When I first applied this one, I didn't think it was the right shade, but after about 10 minutes it looks flawless. I have used different brand blush, powder, and eye shadows along with it and it's versatile that way as well. 4 stars instead of 5 just because I feel it takes slightly longer to apply than other fountains and the longevity of it is good, but does look iffy after about 12-14 hours. Overall a good product for the price. * I would only recommend this product to oily skin girlies because i have dry skin, and this seemed to make it worse. As the day went on, it would get patchier. * This foundation does not stay on the face, easily comes off. My other products arent sitting on it well. When i get home i want to immediately take it off because i dont like the feeling of it on my face.

This bottle and cap is pretty much the same as the more matte version. The cap on both comes right off. If it's in a makeup bag or you're travelling, good luck. Most foundations you can pick it up from the top of the bottle and the cap won't come off, but this one comes off with ease. * I love the color and application of this foundation, but it always settles into skin lines no matter what primer is used so after about 5-6 hours it looks dry and flaky. For short term use, it's nice, but for an all-day wear, I wouldn't recommend."

I have dry skin and it looks so nice and glowy yet never greasy. It's good for day to day. I love the color too. I have light medium olive skin and the coverage is enough to where it blends just fine. Not a holy grail, but a consistent go-to. * This 👏 product 👏 is 👏 incredible 👏!! It makes my skin look like skin, just perfected!! It does not look like I have makeup on! It evens out my skintone and adds the perfect amount of coverage for every day, especially during hot summer days. I bought this because I was on the hunt for something that would be lighter and not melt off my face in a gross cakey way in the heat, and this is it!! I wish I tried it sooner!! * As a very oily girl, i hate to say but i am disappointed. The doible wear is great for oily skin but i needed something light coverage and matte at the same time. I needed something to wear to work everyday. Unfortunately, my oily skin pertruded after a two hours snd i had to pat down my skin. So i recommend if you have you combo skin but for oily skin not necessarily. * I'm on the fence. Love the finish very natural. Doesn't settle in lines and wrinkles. Very runny and thin seems to take a lot of product to produce a full face coverage.  My 70yo skin on nose is breaking out a bit and this is only new product I am using so I'm just not sure  will keep trying * I really enjoy using this foundation. It is so lightweight, a perfect color match, and wears nicely throughout the day. It doesnt get overly oily/shiny in my T-zone where I experience that the most. Minimal setting into my fine lines and wrinkles - even less when I prep with a primer. 

I highly recommend! * I have dry skin and the regular estee lauder foundation wasnt for me. However, this one worked well. It's lightweight and still covers the small red and dark spots but I would not recommend it to someone looking for a full coverage. * For reference, I have fair warm toned, moderately oily skin. I usually wear 1.05 in Smashbox Studio Skin, and NC15 in MAC Waterweight. I wear 1n2 Ecru in this foundation. I love love this foundation. It is beautiful on, smooth, light coverage. I don't have a lot of dark spots or acne issues. I do have freckles and some redness, but not crazy. This coverage is perfect for me for daily wear. It plays with my other products. I don't get weird grainy break down around my nose, chin, and under my glasses at the bridge of my nose like I do with other foundations. It will last my 16 hour day and still look great, no fading or disappearing act. If you need full coverage, you can skip this one but if you just need an even out with a natural look, this is your girl. I thought Fenty EZ Dropz were the best thing ever until I tried this foundation, and now I won't touch the EZ Dropz again."

The coverage was not what I was looking for. * Bought it as I just like a light color corrector, that is hydrating.  Pacifica made a great one, then they changed it, and stopped making it.  Tried once, out of the box, and it was DRYING. Like a foundation. I am 54 and foundations are not helpful to middle aged skin. You want something hydrating smooth.  Perhaps this was an old tube, but I'm taking it back.  Not sure what to try next. * It works as foundation and sunscreen * Really picky on skin prep. Ive tried a variety of different primers and moisturizers before applying and its always hit or miss. When it works it works but sometimes ir will randomly start pilling halfway through blending. Not a dependable application so a bit disappointing sometimes * I havent decided if im going to keep this. I used the shade finder to pick a shade, but it turned out very orange. I don't think another shade would work for my neutral skin tone and I don't think anyone would ever naturally be this orange for the Light to match them. That said, I am able to use it under my eyes to hide dark circles and then I put a regular foundation on top of it. That works pretty well so I might keep it. I was just hoping to use this as a foundation for my whole face and that won't work unless i want to look like Trump. * Although what I bought is just a little darker than what I needed, I'm mixing it with my lighter foundation and it's perfect."
90,urban decay cosmetics,hydromaniac tinted moisturizer,pimprod2021082,2567739," * This foundation is a must-have, especially for mature skin! The formula is super hydrating and lightweight, so it never settles into fine lines or clings to dry patches. It gives the skin a fresh, dewy finish that looks effortlessly natural—like your skin, but better.

What I love most is its versatility. You can apply a sheer layer for a radiant, no-makeup makeup look, or build it up for more coverage without it ever feeling as heavy. It blends seamlessly and keeps my skin looking healthy and plump throughout the day.

If you want a foundation that enhances your skin rather than masking it, this is it! Perfect for everyday wear and so comfortable, you'll forget you're wearing foundation * IMMEDIATE no. As soon as I applied this to my face… dry patches all over and sunk into every fine line. How is this labled ""hydrating"" and ""dewy""?! I have normal/dry skin and this was nothing but matte and drying! * I've been using this foundation for over a month now. I don't like the smell and feel of foudation usually but this is so lightweight and has no noticeable smell. Little goes a long way, it has outstanding coverage that still looks natural. My skin is sensitive to some makeup products and this hasn't caused me any acne or breakouts. I will definitely repurchase! * I have been having really dry skin this winter and I saw this and read the reviews to see everyone was saying how hydrating this was.. it made my dry skin MORE dry. I have been wanting to be more natural but my face has had a lot of redness latwly so i was excited to tey this product. :( * Beautiful look and light weight. It is hydrating and gives a nice dewy look. Unfortunately when i try to use a damp sponge (product instructions say you can use a sponge) it completely removes the product. Maybe its just me but it only works if i use a brush which im not a fan of.  Also noticed if i sweat and try to dab it, the make up comes off completely as well. And this happens even if i use powder which works fine with other foundations. * this the best foundation the that feels like I'm not wearing layers of foundation. In fact I hate when I feel foundation that super heavy and can tell that you're wearing layers of foundation. The only down fall is if your oily you do need to use blotting sheets to absorb the foundation. * This is by far my favorite foundation!"

The color match is amazing, it's very hydrating, buildable coverage, and long lasting. A little goes a long way. I prefer to blend with my fingers and finish with a damp beauty blender. * really wanted to give this a chance but sadly it just wasnt for me ;( i have combo skin and makeup tends to separate/get cakey around my chin and forehead and sadly this one goes right into that category. at first it looks really good and it does hold up a dewy finish but after 1-2 hours-ish it got way too greasy on me, started flaking off, and also oxidized quite a bit, leaving an orangish tone to my skin. i did my makeup for class today and within hours all the makeup on my chin was patchy and mostly gone :c (i use both powder & setting spray) * I wanted to love this foundation. I really did. I've never had a foundation that matches my skin color so perfectly. (Fresco, 2C3) But I couldn't get past the smell. It's so bad! Maybe it's just me but it's the worst odor of any makeup I've ever used.  There are no words to describe it. I hoped the odor would die down a bit after it dried, but nope. If this foundation restored my skin to look like that of a twenty year old it would still be a hard no. I gave it two stars for color match."

I love everything about this foundation and it has become my go to. Lightweight so you don't need to use a lot, buildable coverage, liquid or powder blush goes on over it well. All around recommend and will keep buying it! * I get compliments on my skin EVERYTIME i wear this. Its second to none. So underrated. I have combination and sensitive skin. * This is a nice foundation but I don't find this foundation particularly luminous. To me it's almost a soft matte. I have to add oil to it to achieve any luminosity. coverage is a solid medium and I would consider it buildable. I don't find it great for dry mature skin.  It can look a little cakey if not applied in thin layers. I will finish it but won't repurchase. For my skin type I much prefer the Healthy Glow foundation as an all purpose foundation. This foundation is more full glam for me. * This is my new favorite foundation. I can apply it with my hands, brush, sponge and it always looks so beautiful and natural. The color match is perfect and it lasts throughout my entire 8 hour work day and beyond. I cannot recommend this enough. I also do have oily/combo skin. * The price of this foundation is ridiculous, but I keep buying it because for my skin it is the best foundation out there. I just love it. I apply with a sponge and it looks beautiful all day long. * The foundation has great coverage with a very light feeling. * I don't wear makeup often but this foundation is the best that I have seen on me.  I receive compliments every time I wear it.  I have BR42 and it makes my face look bright - I love the color."

I was so happy with it! 10/10 * I loved this product! The bottle, the color match, the way it sets but i have combi skin and it broke apart and got shiny * I bought 2 shades . Im in my 40's with combo skin.  I got L10N and L20. Heres my opinion: Its a bit yellow toned to me. Go in person to buy it. It gets darker as it oxidizes, so the lighter ended up the best shade.You have to apply it quickly as it drys down fast, it looks a bit masky upon first applying, but melts into the skin within a few minutes and looks really good for the most part. It does not settle into fine lines or wrinkles. But it transfers really bad onto everything and starts looking worn off and patchy on dry spots as the day goes on. It just wasn't good for me for the price. I would not buy again or recommend. * I'm very oily, in my mid-40s, and still get the occasional breakout. I've had trouble with my  foundation faves now caking (prestige brands). I found this one and it is my new go to. I bought the Smashbox oil control primer along with the foundation. It wears all day without caking. It covers just right. You don't have to use a setting powder, but it works good with one if that's preferred. Mid-day I have minimal shine and can go without fixing it. Game changer! * I've been trying to find the right combination of moisturizer + sunscreen + this foundation + setting spray to keep my skin looking as skin-like as possible. This foundation is not as easy as others to create that effect, unfortunately. I usually end up looking a bit dry and my skin looks made-up, not natural. Doesn't seem to matter what combination of light layers and dewy setting spray I use, I can see the foundation and it settles in my pores. Not a great look. I'll be sticking with Easy Blur and my Ciele skin tint instead since those always go on flawlessly and look natural. * An ulta employee recommended this to me when I asked for something similar to the Mac Studio Fix Fluid, but a cruelty free option. This did not disappoint. I have oily skin and this wears beautifully. * I tried this foundation because the Smashbox 24 hr Hydra foundation was gold. However, this foundation is too matte, does not stay in place, does not cover well, and looks very unnatural."

Genuinely, everything is getting so expensive and I definitely don't think it's worth splurging when you can find a dupe. Anyways, this foundation skin tint blew my mind when I put it on.

I've gotten four complements on my foundation today and I never would with the armani. I was hesistant to purchase it for a while because I thought the quality would suck.

Morgan Turner recommended it so I picked it up and it's now my go-to foundation. As comparison, I own Chanel, Nars, Fenty foundations (and a lot more brands), and I keep going back to this.

Its a pass for me and I threw out the remaining priduct. * I wear tinted sunscreen but felt I needed something more when I wear a full face of makeup. This has great coverage, not tacky, good color match and long wearing. Great price point since I don't wear it every day. * I think it just depends in what typ on skin you have. * This is my nee favkrite foundation. I stopped wearing makeup because foundation always felt too heavy and settled on my face. This did not. Makeup looked great all night. * Color matches beautifully to whats shown online, lightweight. Light coverage but also buildable. I use one pump amd than do a powder foundation by maybelline and lasts all day. This may not cover acne prone skin, but it definitely helped a little with redness on my cheeks. A good product all around, it doesnt feel heavy. * I love this foundation and have used it for years! The shade I use matches me perfectly and the liquid is very blendable and feels light on my skin. I only have one complaint and its about the pump. I miss the old screw-on caps! The pump wastes so much product because you can't really control how much is coming out and can't get all of the liquid out especially if you're getting close to the bottom and shake it up. With the old screw-on cap, you had control of how much you want to get out and you could get all of the product out. The only downfall of that was possibly dropping the bottom, but I waste so much product and have to buy more often which is just messed up L'Oreal. I love this product though and will stick with it so long as the formula and color stay the same."

It's a wonderful, flexible formula that's never cakey. * I buy ivorynude (one if the lightest shades).The color mathecs perfects, at first.

It gives such a beautiful satin finish that is not too matte and not too glowy just perfect. I will definitely buy this again and I've recommended it to quite a few of my friends and they love it as well! * I have been trying to decide why I am not reaching for this foundation and I have come to the conclusion I may have gotten an old bottle. The texture is thick and gel like; not what I would expect from a ""nude natural"" foundation. Looks cakey. and when I shake it I don't hear or feel any movement in the bottle. It doesn't really smell spoiled although it does have a fragrance as Dior does. I have tried thinning it out with oil or moisturizer but then it doesn't dry down as it should. I am disappointed but don't know if it's actually the product or that I received  an old bottle. Unfortunately I tossed the box. It's not impossible as I have received  expired products from the warehouse on a couple of other occasions. But I have definitely had better foundations that cost less. * I was not wowed by this foundation. maybe my color match wasn't the best. I am fair to light with a neutral leaning slightly warm complexion and I don't think there is a great match for me in this product. I did not find this product to look very natural or give me any sort of radiance. I felt it looked semi matte rather than a natural finish. Coverage was fine-light to medium as expected. I much prefer Chanel's Healthy Glow foundation. I have mature skin and think perhaps this foundation is better suited to a younger customer. I didn't dislike it but I would not repurchase it. For me it looked rather flat no matter how I prepped my skin. * This is a fantastic foundation! It's lightweight and  leaves me looking naturally flawless. I will say it doesn't completely cover dark spots/acne but I am personally fine with that- nothing a little concealer can't help with. I will definitely be repurchasing. * Wonderful product! * This is the best foundation that I have tried in at least the last 5 years of searching for ""the one"".  Not too heavy or too light. Not cakey and does not settle into my fine lines. This foundation lasts throughout the workday and well into the evening. Definitely worth the price. Finally!  I've found the one!! * Here's a quick review you can use for Dior foundation at Ulta:

""I absolutely love how smooth the Dior foundation applies to my skin! It blends effortlessly, giving me a flawless finish that feels lightweight yet provides great coverage. The formula feels luxurious, and it lasts all day without creasing or feeling heavy. Whether you're going for a natural look or building it up for full glam, this foundation is a game-changer. Highly recommend trying it out—you won't be disappointed!"""

100,maybelline,super stay up to 24hr hybrid powder-foundation,pimprod2036593,2603936," * The best powder foundation ive found and ive tried many. Here's a list of ones ive tried and i still like this better than: Make Up For Ever blurring powder foundation, Bareminerals original loose powder mineral foundation, Jane Iredale loose powder foundation, Jane Iredale pressed powder foundation, Tarte Amazonian Clay loose powder foundation. So yeah — ive tried A LOT. Everytime i come back to this one, i question why i keep trying to find something better. Make sure to first prep your skin with a good moisturizer and primer before applying. Let both fully absorb and dry before applying a powder foundation. This is simply the best ive found and each time i wear it, i get told how good my skin looks and even most recently, how i look like im still in my 20s lol. Im way past 20s. * I purchased the Maybelline Super Stay Up To 24 Hour Hyrbid Powder Foundation in shade 118 as an alternative to a luxury brand I typically use. This powder foundation not only covers better than the luxury brand, it looks and performs better, for a third of the price! The shade is also a perfect match for my fair but olive skintone, not to pink or yellow, just right. I am 37 with dry skin and this still works for me. It does not settle into fine lines, crease, cake up, or become shiny throughout the day. I wear it to work every day and am considering it as my wedding foundation for later this year! I apply it with a brush when I want less coverage and with the accompanying sponge when I want more coverage. It lasts all day and does not transfer. I typically use a setting spray afterwards but even when I forget it still lasts and looks good. I just cant say enough good things about this product! * definitely minimal coverage but works great for a no makeup-makeup day. * This was my go to daily wear foundation. Great colors and nice light coverage. However, almost immediately cracks form in the pan and big chunks fall out of the compact and the little dust particles that are left are pretty much rendered useless. It's unfortunate because the product could be very good. * First off, Shade 112 is absolute perfection for me. This has such incredible coverage that only a small amount is required to help make your skin look so pretty! It can be built up to absolute full coverage but, in my opinion, that can look a bit cakey and too artificial. I use a flat top brush to apply this mostly to my nose and cheeks where I've got the most redness then pull it outward and I'm never not satisfied with the coverage. I've gotten a darker shade to wear as bronzer just because it covers so well! * Nice texture and goes on easy. Wish I had bought a slightly darker shade. * This powder foundation is quick and easy to apply. The only issue I have with it is that it tends to cake up under the eye area if you have wrinkles there. Otherwise it's perfect for smooth and young skin."

It doesn't control oil or provide coverage, but I don't think that's a big issue because it's already incredibly convenient. * Normally I use with my pore smooth as a primer for work then my setting spray. Sometimes I will use a tinted moisturizer or milk flex stick under. Mainly in the winter. As a combo/oily kinda gal, it lasts through work in the restaurant industry and sweating during the summer. I have my summer medium shade and my winter light shade. I am about to be 49 and starting to get fine smile lines around my eyes and mouth. It doesn't settle like others I tried which is important to me. My go to must have can't be without. Ask my hubby 😁 * I was informed by a women at ulta that the powder concealer from tarte that I used was discontinued and that this was it's replacement. I mentioned to her I had sensitive skin and was told there would be no issue as it was a minor ingredient change. this was in fact not the case. I wasted my money on this product as I am not fully covered in hives and welts to the extend I had to take a benadryl. if you have sensitive skin please use with caution. this product differs greatly from their previous one. * I use the liquid Amazon Clay foundation for years. First time trying the powder. This is nice, light weight. Definitely an everyday wear. Leaves skin, soft and does not feel heavy or caky. * Creat coverage * Fine powder * I love how this powder foundation blurs lines! Beautiful easy to blend coverage. Leaves skin feeling soft like your not wearing anything at all. I also love the tarte Amazonian clay foundation this is the same except in powder form. I definitely recommend and i will definitely buy again. I was hesitant at first because of mu fine lines but this soft powder excels at blurring and leaving a beautiful soft matte look. Try it."
103,pat mcgrath labs,skin fetish: sublime perfection foundation,pimprod2040434,2613894," * I was not sure about this after seeing complaints about stinging, tightness, and so on. I use a high strength retinol in the winter so skin tends to be sensitive and dry now (Jan.) I was pleasantly surprised that this serum felt great for me. Obviously, lots of people are sensitive to this, but I was lucky. It actually feels hydrating.

It is easy to blend but the ""runny"" reviews are 100% correct. I build in a number of passes or just use a good concealer + a couple of pumps.

Now, the color choices. Even for a lighter coverage foundation, Ulta's availability of shades was inadequate. I got a ""yellow neutral"" shade because there were no pink or just neutrals in my depth in stock. It works ok since I usually do not build coverage, but I don't understand why they added neutral to descriptions. It is a straight-up warm foundation, although it is not as intensely yellow as some other brands. 

I am not sorry I purchased and wear this every day. Not sure I would recommend at this price point for most people for the trickiness of application, difficulty matching, and risk of sensitivity. I would probably repurchase but only with full shade range like other brands with 40+ (not sure if we can name?) * if I could marry a makeup product I would marry this one. I hate the feeling of foundation on my face and this one looks like skin and feels like skincare. I have put my sisters, my mother, my friends all on this product and everyone is amazed. * I was looking for a new foundation. I get full coverage without the dryness and cracking that other products caused. This product produces a flawless look. * This foundation has many positive attributes. It has a lovely natural finish and a great shade range. It feels like a serum and blends beautifully. I so wanted to love this because the shade was perfect which is unusual for me. Unfortunately, it felt terrible on my face. Granted, I have dry, mature skin but I'm not particularly sensitive. I could not get past the tight feeling from the alcohol in this. It made my skin sting, feel tight and look dry as the day wore on. I felt it wore very well but it also caused some redness for me. I tried several moisturizers, oils and primers and nothing helped. so it's definitely a NO for me. It felt like a strange polymer on my face. However, for anyone not sensitive to a high alcohol content I would still recommend it. It truly is a beautiful foundation and if it was reformulated without so much alcohol I would try it again. * Goes on like a serum, covers like a light weight powder. I received so many compliments. I will purchase again. * I like this foundation if i know im not going to be wearing makeup all day it gets oily. I have oily/ dry skin.

IT doesn't even have the description on the product so that sealed the deal for them. Makes no sense why they make it so hard for the consumer. * Good color match and formula. Problem packaging, amount of product, and price. The product was stuck to the cap. I was able to get the product out and place it in a tiny jar. Packaging needs redesign for the price. Can't recommend for this reason. * No matter which technique I try, the outcome is always the same: it cracks, transfers, and looks terrible after just half an hour. It exacerbates my acne, making me feel like I've wasted my money 😞 * I was really excited to try this foundation as I have heard a makeup artist I watch on youtube obsess over it for years.

I originally ordered this online because my local Ulta did not carry this line.  I had to drive an hour away to exchange for a better match.  On my skin 450 Above is the perfect match.  It looks like I am not wearing anything!  I find this product to be lightweight, as if I am just wearing a moisturizer. 

One challenge I do have is that my skin does have a slight reaction.  With ultra-sensitive skin, that is normal for me, so I would like to see the product adapt to these types of issues, as I am not sure which ingredient is causing the problem.  I have almost finished the bottle, so I still use it.  I just can't use it daily. * I tried this on in the store first and from the first time I applied it and took it off, I've been impressed! Now that I've used it for my going out makeup, I believe this product might be my favorite thing! Not only does it feel great on the skin, but in addition to some elf primer and morphe setting spray, it stayed on my skin super well! My skin tends to break out super easily and foundations and skin tints in the past have highlighted dry spots on my skin and this has yet to do this. I also forgot to take it off last night and i was dreading washing it off after a night out and sleeping on it, but my skin feels great given the circumstances! Wonderful product!! * This product pills terrible. I can't put any skin care on before hand or it makes it pill worse. Very drying on the skin and patchy. * Yes my daughter loves this shade it's the perfect match for her. And her skin doesn't look dry. * I've tried it with different primers, brushes, sponges, hands, no primer and it would just pill every single time and when it did looks nice i couldn't apply more product because it would pill!! * I really like this fundation , good for dry skin * I had such high hopes for this product! I was looking for a hydrating skin tint with an SPF of 30 minimum and this one matched all of my criteria at a great price point. The first time I used it, it didn't blend very well but I figured maybe I just wasn't used to this product and that it would get better with time. The second time I noticed the coverage was very patchy and it was even dry at parts - weird because I really don't have dry skin. After noticing the color I ordered online just wasn't matching I went to Ulta to get a color match, which I was pretty optimistic about because there's such a huge shade range. While we couldn't find a shade that perfectly matched me (it was either too dark or too light), we did notice that this product was just giving me a lot of texture on my face. I ended up returning this all together and getting another brand."
106,hourglass,ambient soft glow foundation,pimprod2033509,2599657," * It is a nice formula that looks beautiful on acne textured skin. 
Not sure what it is in this formula that is breaking me out, but everytime i wear this after washing it off there is always new pimples. Took me awhile to realize this. * Im 53 looking for a semi matte foundation. I was hoping this was it . It goes on beautifully , but after an hour it separates on my forehead , disappears on my nose and makes me shine not in a good way. All this even with the hourglass primer . * I LOVE this product; perfect coverage plus the fact it is the only one on the market that matches my skin tone.  I am very Fair complected.  And this shade matches my skin perfectly, leaving no line of demarkation.  Love it. * I love this foundation! It lasts all day and has buildable coverage if you use a sponge to apply. It gives a blurred and glowy appearance to my acne prone skin. I find it also works very well in humid and hot climates (just don't overapply). I was surprised by some of the negative reviews. * I really wanted to like this. I have oily skin, im 38… i do have larger pores and some texture. i always do really good skin prep before makeup. Ive given this several tries with different techniques and every time the same things happen: 
1) it looks absolutely beautiful upon the initial application, within about an hour it settles into EVERY. SINGLE. PORE. It looks like i applied it specifically to enhance them.
2) i dont know how this is even possible but if you have ANY peach fuzz on your face at all this foundation clings to them and makes it stand out so eveeyone can see it. I dermaplane regularly and ive never had makeup do this before. 
3) after about 3 hours of wear time, it has separated and become patchy, and it cannot be fixed with touch up powder.  It also looks dry and chalky but oily at the same time… not sure how this happens. 
4) if you touch this with your phone, your hands, literally anything it moves around your face or just comes off. 

Im not saying its bad quality i think it just isnt working for me and my skin. Ill be returnjng and going back to lancome matte long wear. * I like that it covers up my redness (usually I have to color correct with green) but no matter what primer and moisturizer I use it looks really cakey. * Not for oily/combination skin. I was not impressed with this foundation."

My daughter found this for me and so far i absolutely love it. The color match is perfect.  It goes on so soft and smooth and there is not a weird or strong smell. * Good coverage. * The first time gave me a rash so I waited a couple of months to make sure it was this and I tried it again and gave a red bumps all over my face. I'm not the only one. There's a lot of bad reviews w the same effect. * Excellent powder foundation for older women.  I don't know why my color doesn't seem to be available anymore though.  What's going on with the limited shade offerings?  Fenty still has all 50 shades on their website! * Ive been using this powder in shade 150 since it came out. All of a sudden theres no lighter shades? Not even one around the color ive been using. I've probably went through 10 of these compacts, and am beyond disappointed. Def gives me the ick for the brand!! * Perfect match for my skin tone. * I did the color match online and they matched me with a Shane that is not even available anymore. At the store I matched with 210 and the consultant said they are not going to carry that shade anymore. why would this supposedly inclusive brand cut all these different shades from their lineup? Now I guess I have to find another brand to buy powder from."
109,covergirl,simply ageless skin perfector essence foundation,pimprod2042952,2618803," * I love this foundation. My skin looks glowy, and it improves my hyperpigmentation. * This covergirl essence foundation is the even better version of the Chanel les beiges water fresh complexion touch. I usually use very high end products and this is the longest lasting light coverage foundation I have ever used. I'm a flight attendant and this lasts 12+ hours, does not separate, and looks glowy and amazing. I never use drugstore products and I am so glad I tried this bevause it is my new fav light coverage foundation. 10000/10 reccomend. * This is my favorite ""skin-tint"" esque product I have tried thus far. It's extremely light weight, blends in quite easily, doesn't look weird over textured skin, lasts a good amount of time, and has a natural finish without looking too glowy. I would rate this a 4.5 if I could though, because I really dislike the packaging. The wrapper is really hard to remove and makes you peel of the label in order to be able to access the product, and the bottom of the product is bulbous, so it can barely stand up straight. It's not enough to make me stop using the product though, the formula really is incredible, I just would love the packaging to be updated a bit as it seems extremely cheap, even for a drugstore brand. * This product is perfect for those who are minimalists with their make up routine and want minimal coverage. It looks so nautral and evens out my skin tone while covering flaws. I really do love! * FINALLY…. A product that is super thin, lightweight, light coverage, AND works for my combo/oily skin! I will buy this forever! * I really didn't know how this would look on me, I usually use more silicone based foundation so... But this one was very nice. I did have to put it on the back of my hand and give a little mix first then apply it to my face. I tried pumping it directly on my skin and it didn't blend right.. This foundation is definitely not beginner friendly.  I'm sure everyone is different but this is the best method for me. Also I have dry, mature, skin. It wore nicely for about 4 hours. After that I needed a touch up. But it's definitely a nice light coverage!! * This stuff is the definition of ""your skin but better."" I've tried SO many tinted serums, wasted so much money on $40+ brands for them to be useless. I've found the easiest way to apply this is directly to your face, then blend with fingers, then blend out with a beauty blender. 

I have sensitive skin and rosacea, this is the first product I've ever used that didn't irritate or break out my skin. And weirdly, despite having pretty light coverage, this does an amazing job at covering my redness. Covering actually might not be the right word, it's more like toning almost. It doesn't look like I have anything on, yet still seems to almost eliminate my redness (which has always been severe). I have no clue how this works, I swear it's magic because  I cannot understand it. 

Coverage is somewhat buildable, but definitely meant to be used lightly. It'll get cakey if you set it with powder, and then if it gets wet it'll lift really weird, but I don't ever feel the need to use powder. Powder blush and brozer work fine over it, just not setting your whole face. I'll go all day just with this and not get oily at all, it doesn't slide off like other tinted serums, and when it does wear it looks really natural. A bit sticky at first but it will dry down, and feels like there's nothing on your face! Definitely is somewhat waterproof, by far the most oit of any other product like this I've tried. 

I've worn this to bed many times without any breakouts, and in the morning I truly can't tell whether there's any of it left on my face (in a good way), because my skin looks better after wearing this. Probably the bakuchiol, which is what prompted me to buy it bc I already use a serum with that every night that I love. 

And again, I don't have great skin to begin with, and I've gotten endless compliments on my skin since I started using this. People saying my rosacea looks better, pores, texture, etc. 

I don't bother with reviews much, but man, every time I use this stuff, every time I look in the mirror I can't stop thinking how good my skin looks, and how natural."

It is hard to find cool toned makeup for fair skin, but this color match was perfect! * blends beautifully and looks natural. doesn't settle into fine lines.  light enough shade range for a redhead. I hope this formula/product sticks around. * I use a brush for my foundation and this product spreads easily, and is nicely pigmented. * To start, I'm 41 with dry skin and rosacea and I've had the hardest time trying to find a foundation that covered my redness and also didnt dry my skin out and flake off. This foundation has been awesome! Great coverage, doesn't dry out my skin and covers all my rosacea redness!! * it matched my skin tone perfectly, but made my skin crack, But it was good overall probably won't buy again 4 stars * Great foundation, especially for the price! Bought the primer as well which works very well in preparation for the foundation. Went back and bought mascara to try. It is also a wonderful product. * One wintery day I wandered into Ulta and asked for a natural finish foundation recommendation. I had never heard of this before but was willing to give it a shot, especially with the great price point. I've been wearing it for almost a year now and it's my go-to. The color stays true throughout the day and has a very natural finish. It's also very buildable depending on the coverage you prefer. I've had lots of comments about my ""beautiful, glowing skin"", never had that happen before, lol!! But seriously, I have struggled for years with acne and this covers it well and does not add to the problem."

The formula is amazing—lightweight, dewy, and gives a healthy glow without being too shiny. It feels hydrating and wears beautifully throughout the day. Unfortunately, the shades lean too red for my olive skin tone, which makes it hard to find a good match. If L'Oréal expanded the shade range with more neutral and olive undertones, this would be a perfect foundation! * This settled into my lines and made me look older.  It went on so well and 6 hours later was very patchy, worn off in several places even though I used a primer.  I am very disappointed. * Used this for years. Its an amazing foundation. No cons. It is lightweight comfortable easy to use and has sunscreen in it! Plus! * I had such high hope for this product since I've seen a good amount of people loving it but when I tried it, it separated. Even when I used a blurring primer it still sunk into my pores to the point where it looked like I had dots all over my face. I say try it to see if it works for you but this was my experience with it. If you don't like a strong sunscreen smell, this product has just that. * Goes on smoothly. Good coverage. * I have no idea why this product is online only in my area! It' should be in every store. Fantastic for maturing skin. Doesn't accentuate fine lines or settle in creases."

I love wearing it with the glinda glow drops * Ive been using this foundation for the past year and a half. At first it wasnt my favorite, i did find it to be a little patchy and if you dont have your skin perfectly prepped it does seperate a little on top if it. But after playing around with it a little i found using a damp beauty blender works the best, no primer underneath for some reason looks better but for a long night out i do wear it and i just make sure it simmers in my skin for a while before applying the foundation, and of course like i said before having my skin fully prepped and hydrated before makes this foundation look unreal on me. For all the cons this foundation has i think the pros outweigh it. If you make if work it looks like a real life filter on you, its hydrating so maybe thats why no primer works best bc this is a skincare infused foundation. Ive tried many foundations (milani, born this way, clinique, estee lauder, nyx) and i just keep coming back to this bc none of the others make me look as good as this does, i get compliments all the time and i have multiples stocked up now lol * I absolutely never write reviews, but I had to for this poduct. I was blown away by this foundation. Beautiful nautral matte foundation that leaves a little glow, perfect medium to full coverage without looking cakey, and insane shade range for us fair girlys. I havent found a single bad thing to say about this foundation. Will be repurchasing this over and over again!! * Just tried this to compare it to my shape tape foundation, wanted to see if it was lighter and would be better on my dry in spots and acne prone skin and it worked great! I never realized just how much shape tape feels like you have makeup on your skin and this makes it feel like nothings there. Other products blended out on top of it like a dream! Will be trying the sweetener concealer next! * This is the first foundation that has really helped with not enhancing my dry spots. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. * This is truly my favorite foundation ever! It looks flawless and I always get compliments on it!! * I love this foundation! I have very dry skin and this foundation looks beautiful! It doesnt separate overtime on the skin and keeps the skin hydrated for a long time!

The consistency is super lightweight. It doesnt feel like I have makeup on. * I love how smooth it goes on and how natural it looks. covers imperfections without looking heavy. * This is the best foundation I have EVER used! I have KP, Eczema, and dry/sensitive skin. This product is hydrating and doesn't cake onto my skin, plus it provides great coverage! I live in a very hot and humid area, and the makeup lasts all day! I absolutely love this stuff! * I have good skin and this product was recommended by an Ulta associate, so I tried it. I wish I had returned it, but I tried to make it work. It made my skin look pasty and oily like I was sick.  I tried mixing it with other foundations, because I really wanted to love it. It's Chanel! Still, it just ruined everything I tried it with. I tried it as a highlight, and it was ok for that, but not good. I put it in my purse as an emergency foundation, but in the GA heat, the beads melted together. Overall, it was just a mess for me. I really regret this purchase. * Yes, it's pricy but it's doing the job of 3 different products: eye primer, concealer, and foundation. It's also very easy to take when traveling. 

How to use it as a concealer: use your finger and tab it under your eye
How to use it as a foundation: use the small brush that comes with it and contour it on your face. Then use a foundation brush or beauty blender to ""blend it out"" (don't just use a regular foundation brush - it might be too much)
How to use it as a eye primer: use the small brush that comes it it and apply it on your eyelid before applying eyeshadow. 

Another trick: while this is a natural finish, you can add a subtle glow by applying Chanel liquid highlighter underneath (as a primer). * I really like Chanel's original Water Fresh product, but it's too bulky to travel with. This version has way better packaging and has more coverage so it's particularly good for work and event travel. But, oddly, it looks and feels drying on my (normal, slightly sensitive) skin. It highlights tiny fine lines I didn't know I had. The formula is not significantly different than the original, it just has more pigment, and the whole schtick is hyalauronic acid and hydration, so I don't know why it has this effect. It's noticeable, so I have to beef up my skincare accordingly in order to wear it and apply it while my moisturizer/SPF are still tacky. May not be suitable for folks with dry or textured skin, or folks who find these issues too fussy."

Color matched perfect and the application feels more like foundation w/ light coverage. I apply it with a beauty blender, finish with Elf hi-Def setting powder and I'm out the door! Try it for yourself :) * For a long time, instead of using foundation I used either Shape Tape or Born This Way where I need it most and would just blend it out onto my moisturizer.  This summer I developed some really bad sunspots and no matter how much corrector/concealer I'd use, my skin would look grey where the sun spots were.  One day, I tried this because I had gotten a sample and omg it has saved me!  I finally felt comfortable going out again without thinking everyone was staring at me.  The weird part was, it wasn't as heavy or full coverage as my concealer but worked 100x better.  Well, I'm finally at the end of that little tube and also, I now need a lighter color, so here I am.  

This CC cream is better than any other I've tried, it somehow has great coverage but looks incredibly soft and natural.  I'm also able to use it where I need it without seeing lines of demarcation.  This is most definitely an unsung hero and I'm baffled as to how it doesn't have a better rating. * I came in today looking for the tarte BB cream, but saw the cloud CC cream and went with it instead.  It matched well, covered great & has a light feel.  However, I got home and went on the tarte website only to discover it's already been discontinued.  😩 WHY?!? * I love Tarte. Not my favorite foundation, but its great for every day or summertime. * This product was a little too much coverage for me and settled into fine lines. I returned and bought the Tarte tinted moisturizer. I'm happy with that. * This is a nice light-feeling foundation. This also has the shade that's the closest match to my own skin tone. Only need a little bit, one pump and get a nice medium coverage for redness, etc. * I love this as a foundation. I use a very small amount because it does tend to oxidize a bit if you build too much product in my experience. Great natural look."
118,exa,high fidelity foundation,pimprod2019009,2573283," * ECSTATIC IN AN UNDERSTATMENT!!! I have been searching for a foundation like this for YEARSSS. (I have super sensitive combo skin leaning dry. Liquid foundations always look terrible on me after 1 hour. I do great skin prep too!) Lightweight, breathable foundation, quality ingredients, minimal ingredients, fragrance free, light to medium coverage, skin like finish, 6 to 8 hour wear still looking flawless, doesnt dry my skin out, doesnt irritate my skin, doesnt cling to dry patches, COLOR MATCH ON POINT, skincare ingredients, AFFORADABLE, anti-pollution (I live in SLC, worst air quality/pollution here) I  literally cried when i first put this foundation on i was so blown away at how perfect it was. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NEVER EVER discontinue or reformulate. I am a customer for life and this foundation has changed my life. * very skin like finish! no fuss foundation. * This is an undetectable foundation on my mature, dry skin, though it can build easily for extra coverage. I will just add additional drops on those darker spots, which still peek through but look more homogenous. But coverage is not my main concern, so this winner maintains the slightly dewy glow over a well -prepped skin base, still looking un made-up by the end of the day. Also, goes over mineral sunscreen flawlessly. IMO it is on par with Haus Labs, Nars Radiant LIght, MUF reboot; my other favs. I am trying another shade, though am happy with Katey, the match I found via the skin models- so that's my recommendation for finding your shade, rather than the description. It is on sale, so... TRY IT! * I'm assuming this foundation is on clearance because of quality issues… I received my order and the formula is completely separated and cannot be mixed back together to a good consistency. * I was so surprised when i first used it, my skin looked like skin. I like a lightweight natiral finish and this gives me exactly that! It also stays on all day/night, only thing is that it oxidizes a little bit but not wnything drastic. Has been my go-to foundation for over a year already! * good match for hard shade (fair/light olive) and good for sensitive/acne prone/scar/texture skin. decent coverage but feels light and natural. but doesnt really set (makeup smudges on my cat) & taking the top off pulls the entire pump out sometimes * I have used this foundation for a few years and it's never let me down. I fluctuate between a range of their lighter, cool toned shades depending on the time of year. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. A few things I've learned along the way: 

*A thin base layer will cover most spots and uneven tones. If you need more coverage, then spot treat with a little more foundation.
*It pairs beautifully on top of Nudestix tinted sunscreen.
*Applies well with brushes or sponges, but better with your fingers.
*A stippling, dabbing motion is the best method to apply the thin layers.

I'm 41, and I receive many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation, and I feel like I look more youthful with this on. I will definitely continue to repurchase!"

This foundation provided just the right amount of coverage without feeling heavy or making my face look oily or anything like that. Color matched me perfectly as well! * I prefer a foundation that glides on but this one was sort of difficult to smooth on and looked a bit blotchy. * I tried this for my occasional puffy morning eyes but did not see any significant results. The big bottle of PTR for just firming is a way better option if you're looking for those kind of results. * This is a perfect foundation for dry, sensitive and/or mature skin. Great buildable coverage with a dewy feel for long lasting moisturized day. * This is 100% the best foundation I have ever used in my entire life. I get SO many compliments on my skin and questions about what foundation I'm wearing when I'm at work... and my skin is something I really struggle with. I have really damaged skin from acne/picking and tons of dark spots and even present acne and this covers it up SO well when I apply it after doing a little bit of concealer. It just melts right into your skin and its magic bc it makes my skin look even better than before. It doesn't look like makeup when it goes on. I've never genuinely loved a foundation so much in my life please keep making this forever. * This has a very liquid consistency, however the coverage is good with only one pump, and I like it better than the matte foundation.

But its not a good foundation * I've been using EL DW for 10 years, but lately it seems like it oxidizes on my skin right away. This Youthforia foundation has been great! I use the pregamd primer with it too. The color seems like it blends with my skin so well, but the coverage is still plenty to hide my freshly red acne scars (working on it!). It's so smooth and blurring and looks amazing. I was worried it would transfer easily because of the dewy finish, but it's been good. I wore it over the holidays and hugged a lot of people and I didn't see any foundation marks lol. I always use translucent powder on top though, so I'm not sure if that's the reason. It lasts really well too. It's very hydrating and genuinely does feel weightless enough to sleep in.

Regarding the controversy around this brand and lack of shade range, I don't think it deserves any more hate than every other foundation brand from the last 50 years that only catered to white people. They tried to be more inclusive based on feedback and it was a flop, but then they tried again and they deserve credit for that. They're a small company so they probably focused on the majority of the market first (in America, that's still light and medium skin tones). They probably had more shades in development and might've released them too early. Review bombing a startup is immature and lacks perspective and consideration. * I could not find a shade in this product and I am a medium skin tone. There has also been controversies about the darkest shades being pure black but that is besides the point, this foundation works horribly on skin with texture and that is oily, it peels, lifts, and just does not look good on bumps or acne. Might I add this formula is very overpriced for what it is."

With acne (cystic) it easily applies and as long as you dont touch your face too much it lasts for hours! This product seriously changed my life. (I pair it with the Glow Watermelon moisturizer as a primer/base) . * When i applied it looked a little too pink for me, by the end of the day it got very cake-y and had gone very orange. I loved the price and texture at first but I think I will be stickinh with my tarte for now. * I got the white one to do goth/halloween makeup and it smelled like i shouldnt have put it on my face due to the awful chemical smell, was hard to blend it was overall terrible, I've used halloween face paint that looked better than this. * Been using this for years literally like 5 years ive tried other foundation but this is the best for me, im oily skin and this one is very thin light on skin but full coverage! Not like other foundation thats thick and heavy on skin. Little goes along the way! Sad that i can only buy this online, i dont like their new foundation lol. Im mixing 2 shades to get the shade that i really want. * Literally my favorite foundation so sad it's only online:( im on the dryer side and works good for me!!! * I really hope they don't get rid of this line because I love it!! * I really hope they don't get rid of this line because I love it!!"

It does make you look dewy and glowy, but it does not stay put for so long. It is very oily. * This stuff is amazing! My skin glows! * This formula is streaky and patchy. Does not blend well. * I bought this because I like the Bobbi Brown face primer. I enjoy the citrus scent of both. My skin feels great after application. The coverage is light and sheer but lasts. I apply it with a beauty blender sponge. I took a star off because coverage appears patchy on my neck. The packaging is easy to use. * My mother, in her mid 50's, absolutely loves this product. It feels great, has buildable coverage and has a great color to it. It looks great on older skin and has a very youthful glow. * After reading some of these reviews, I'm seeing that I'm not the only one with the streaking issue. For reference: I'm 41 with combination skin. 

I tried this on in-store. Wasn't in love with it, but Pür changed their tinted moisturizer's colors and they no longer looked good on my skin.

This tint has almost no coverage. It is watery and streaks. Be careful because it will just run out of the tube. It also clings to my dry spots (mostly my chin and around the nose).  I definitely moisturize before I put it on. I've tried it with a brush. I've tried it with a sponge. I've tried it with my fingertips. But it's all the same. It just looks horrible and I could not recommend this."

It was uncomfortable to wear and left my skin looking worse than before. Definitely not for me. * This foundatjon is really more of a setting powder. It doesnt actually cover anything, just makes your face matte. * the lightest shade looks light in the pan and then turns my face orange * It is ok . I expected more . * Super full coverage but at the same time is supper for amazing for all types of makeup looks lets say if you wanna do more clean girl makeup amd you add this powder , a little goes long way btw but if you afd this powder it will make it seem super seemless amd then for a full coverage look beat powder out their makes your makeup look AIRBRUSHED * its not really for me; it isn't low coverage but more like meh coverage. this is my first powder foundation so im sure powder foundations themselves aren't bad, but it really covered nothing. i wanted to like it so bad, especially for the price. :("

True Color Foundation in Warm Almond has been a game-changer in my routine. Its full-coverage, matte finish seamlessly blends into my skin, ensuring my dark spots and acne scars stay hidden all day.

What I love most is its versatility—whether I'm doing a full glam look or wearing it alone, it delivers flawless, lightweight coverage without feeling heavy. Black Opal continues to be a staple in my beauty routine, and this concealer is an absolute must-have! * This product provides great coverage,long wear,user friendly and there is a shade for all skin colors and types. Thank you Black Opal. * Product is so easy to blend out. Has so much pigment and is good for any skin tones. Definitely inclusive * Creamy and smooth it glides right on. Blends very well also very good pigment. My usual brand was out of my shade so I decided to try different brand and I'm not disappointed to say the least 😊 * Goes on smooth and seamless. * I rarely use other foundations. I have been a fan of Black Opal for a Long Time. I love the coverage for my skin and you can mix if the color does not match at a great price! * I bought this foundation being of all the good reviews. Unfortunately the moment i put it on my skin the color was immediately to warm for my complexion, i got the heavenly honey. It looked WAY to orange and when i washed it off it looked like pure orange on my skin. It showed every ounce of texture on my skin (i dont have much texture) and sunk into every pore. Would not recommend at all."
132,juvia's place,i am magic natural radiance foundation,pimprod2037106,2607324," * I love a full coverage foundation. This foundation is by far the best full coverage foundation I have in my collection I recently was trying out a bunch of different foundation since i change founations in the summer and they all don't play well with powders if they are glowy side, I had a little bit left over of this foundation and try it out again and here I am purchasing a couple more. The only thing I will say about it is in the summertime if you sweat or if you're oily, it's going to slide around a bit and it's best for every season other than sunmer other than that, this foundation is absolutely worth a try, and I get compliments on my skin all the time when I wear this I also have a big problem with powders laying and looking gross on my skin and for whatever reason this foundation makes it look how it's supposed to look it plays well with other products and I definitely would recommend it to anybody that has a desire for bouncy full coverage skin. * Turns orange * The foundation matched perfectly. The coverage was great.  A little went a long way. * Doesn't stay down very well, gets onto eveything and makes me very oily * Doesn't stay down very well, gets onto eveything and makes me very oily * I love Juvia Place foundation.   It really works for me.  Great coverage but not overdone. * I bought this foundation about eight months ago and it completely oxidized for darker than my summer shade. It also has a very strong scent and I'm normally not bothered by sense but this one is just super overpowering even with the smallest amount you use no matter what moisturizer or base I use before using this foundation it always clunk to pours and dry patches. I threw it away and never finished it :("
133,essence,16h cover & last powder foundation,pimprod2033174,2597553," * I love this powder foundation. It is cheap but great coverage. Can be built up to full coverage. Since it is a powder foundation you do have to do skincare to prevent it from looking cakey. Moisturizer and sunscreen will be fine to have a great coverage of this foundation. * After YEARS of trying to find a liquid foundation I finally switched to powder. Im 25 and dont have mature skin whatsoever but THIS product saved my life. I will be purchasing again and again!! Other foundations never looked good on my skin, they moved around, looked patchy and never dried completely and I hated the way they felt no matter what I tried. This stuff though- chefs kiss. I dont feel it the way on my skin like other foundstions, it doesnt move and pairs perfectly with the elf putty primer (the white one?) this will forever be my ride or die and it was so easy to find my shade, never looks cakey either. And the price aint bad either! * This powder foundation is pretty good, especially for the price. I've bought it several times already. I mostly use it with my foundation, and its great for touching up areas that have worn off. It doesn't turn my foundations orange, like some other powder foundations do. I also like to use it over a lighter coverage foundation, or to fix the the tone of the foundations that look too yellow on me. It could be a little smoother, but like i said, for the price it's at, i cant complain! * I like the brand, but this product didn't work for me. It made my makeup look cakey and heavy, and it fell apart. * Its really affordable, which for me is good because I really dont want to spend much on makeup. Some days I'll use this alone just to absorb a little oil and shine, but usually I use it over a tinted moisturizer/spf and finish with a setting spray. Works best if you apply it with a brush. It blends well and stays on, and also covers all my acne and scars. Its never caused a breakout. The ingredients are pretty good, but occassionally a batch will smell different? Not sure why that is, theres no artificial fragrances which is a plus. The smell doesnt bother me. Give it a try! * I wanted to like this powder since Essence is a really affordable and great brand and I do really like many of their products. This powder did not work for me personally and sat very cakey on my face. It also would pill and look chalky as well. * This powder is beautiful. I have textured fair skin and this works wonders!!"

It provides full coverage but doesn't feel heavy on the skin. I would buy over and over again. * I have been wanting to try this foundation for a while,  as I love some of the other Milani products, but one of the drawbacks is it can only be purchased online. I finally ordered it and it's ok. I took a quiz to see which color I should order since I've never ordered it before. Again it's only available online, so I can't go test the shades in the store. I am usually an ivory shade in other brands so I got the 220 creamy natural. When it came in, my first reaction was ""oh no"" my fear of ordering the wrong shade came true as the foundation looked really dark and orange. Since I already had it, I decided to test it anyway knowing full well it would not match, but it sort of did end up matching. The dark orange color was just like a film and it was lighter underneath and it blends really well. It feels really lightweight and breathable. It almost feels like you aren't even wearing make up, which makes sense since I found it to be very light coverage. I was hoping for medium to full coverage, but it just evened my skin out like a BB cream would do. I would still recommend it for the price, but wouldn't compare it to the KVD as that's how it was promoted to me. * I took the shade match quiz, the shade was way too light and when applied looks cakey and clings to dry patches. * I got this foundation in the lightest shade and its still too dark and orange. It cakes extremely bad even with two lifht layers. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone! * The cream-to-powder formula is fantastic! I use it alone (no concealer, highlighter, bronzer, blush) and it works great to cover up my acne scars and even out my complexion. However, I have noticed that it breaks me out really badly. I wish there was a clean formula for this type of product. * Right texture for me * 54 with dry skin. I was concerned about this product bc I normal stick to liquid foundation. I have tried almost every one out there but I was extremely surprised by this foundation! It was easily buildiable with smooth application. I was concerned at 1st the color match was a bit darker (245 warm beige) but after concealer & some pressed powder I had the most beautiful sun-kissed glow! For reference I love Nars in Santa-fe, Clinique  CN 40 cream chamois, Colourpop light 55N. I don't really see any skin type having an issue with this product. It was easy to apply, didn't feel heavy or cakey, never felt oily or dry, just smooth & silky. Highly recommend. No issues using other brand products with this foundation. I saw some saying it moves along or was patchy, follow the directions & build it. This is a cream to powder product so it will apply a bit different.  Will repurchase"

This foundation goes on so smooth. * Packaging and scent was nice but the product left an orange tint on my face. It was good coverage and it felt nice on my skin, just not for me. Probably best for tanner people * I find this product is too thick. Its too hard to spread and even takes a bit of effort to squeeze it out of the tube. I want my makeup to be speedy and I find myself not enjoying using it because of this. I also think for a tinted moisturizer, it should be thinner. * I've used this product everyday for YEARS. I can wear it for everyday use for light coverage, or I can easily build it on my skin for a special event. Blurs and smooths, love that it has spf. I will purchase this literally FOREVER. Must have!! * I have been looking at this for a while and finally got it. I love this. I have mature dry skin This stays put without my skin feeling dry. Doesn't accentuate my lines. Not greasy shiny more of a satin finish . * The colors/shades are way darker than others. I use it on my neck and it blends great there. It's pricy for what it is though especially per oz. I wouldn't recommend because of those factors. * This product dulled my skin. The color matched perfectly and a little product was all that was needed for coverage. However, this made my dry skin flake, beaded up, and did NOT provide the glow I expected. Disappointed because I had looked at this product for a long time thinking it would provide the dewy glow my dry skin craves."

This stuff sticks to dry patches and accentuates fine lines. Yes, ita full coverage…when you try spreading it around its so thick it doesnt want to budge. Using a damp beauty blender works way better than a brush. But sadky, i wont be repurchasing. I will use thos to cover some areas on my cheeks,  ur wont ve a full face foundation for me. * Terrible. Does not spread nice. Makes my skin look grainy. Waste of money. * Love the feel of this foundation and it stays on all day long! * This foundation is horrible.

I switched when I found out my E.L.F glow was making me break out. Ive had zero problems since then! 

Im not a foundation or full coverage girlie so putting ny consealer ontop of this really does give me the full face make up look, without feeling sooooo heavy. * Juvia skin booster foundation is sheer and gives a nice glow to skin. I'm fair and purchased number 9 to get a little color. I also like the applicator allowing easy use. Best to dab on and blend with fingers. * First off…. The people reviewing this and getting upset about the coverage is ridiculous. Its not a foundation so chill. Its supposed to be sheer. 
As far as the actual product…. If you can get it to behave properly then its beautiful. Unfortunately it does not play well with other products and the applicator leaves streaks that are hard to blend out. I will be returning this for the difficulty purposes only. Almost great! * was darker than i expected * I love all products by Juvia's place except this. * Love love this product * My favorite light coverage, dewy foundation!

Including any dry skin and did not cover well at all. I wanted to really like it but it didn't work for me * I love this foundation, its like your own skin but better. * At this price I'm pretty disappointed. Color match was great and does not oxidize, but that's where the pros ended for me. Definitely not full coverage, didn't blend well and shifts/splotchy. If you're an oilslick like me… this is a total waste. Maybe good for dryer skin? Going back to Dior at this price point and won't be purchasing this one again. * This foundation brought out texture and wrinkles I have never seen before. It is not very blend-able, as it takes a lot of manipulation to look somewhat acceptable. This product is very drying and I have oily skin. Not to mention it does not adhere to the skin, it slips and sides off your face throughout the day leaving you patchy. * I finally found my holy grail foundation, I didn't even buy it at Ulta but that's how much I loved it to write a review. It feels like I'm wearing nothing, it matches my skin perfectly which has been a nightmare for years trying to find a good match. * This coverage is a lot more sheer and dewy than I had anticipated. This would be a beautiful foundation for someone with dry, mature skin since it does not crease. The colors are not accurate either. I suggest ordering one to two shades darker. * I need to keep looking. I have a full bottle that I hope to find someone that it works for."

It feels so nourishing and applies so evenly. It's light yet gives a good medium coverage. A great summertime weight. Not heavy but yet just enough color. Love it. Buy it. Give it a try. I think you'll like it. * This foundation is so perfect for me. It blends perfectly into my skin. It's so easy to apply. I just dab it on with a beauty sponge and I'm done in minutes! 
I love it ❤️ * I'm not sure why my skin reacts to foundation so terribly, but even the luxury brands make me look a little off. I know my undertone and have been able to pinpoint my exact color profile, so it's not that. Foundation usually sits on top of my face, amplifies my fine lines, and makes me look like a hot mess. Age Perfect Tinted Balm is the only foundation that makes me look better, and I wish I knew about it sooner. It's my favorite! * I have what the skincare industry refers to as ""mature ""skin. I am a make junkie and I had many foundations from drugstores and major department stores but as I got older they all made me look cake and settled into lines. I stumbled on this product and I love it. It's my skin only better. It lasts almost all day on my  combination oily dry skin. It is a wonderful product with light medium coverage for mature skin. Will definitely buy again * I've used 3 pots of this now and I'm still somehow surprised by how nice it is. The formula feels like it won't cover much, but it softens the appearance of/seems to fill and even out pores, scars, wrinkles, or any textures--I often get compliments on how smooth my skin looks when I use this. I've gone back and forth between two colors because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the color match is a little difficult. All in all, I keep trying new foundations just to come back to this one and be impressed by it. * I'm a light-medium skin tone that leans towards cool. I got started on this because an influencer raved about it a few yrs. ago. I decided to try it and couldn't had been more thrilled. I use shade fair 20 for reference. In the pot it looks more like a peach shade. It glides on effortlessly and melts into my skin. My dry/mature skin looks healthy. I'm sure I will get tired of this foundation, but for the last 3 yrs. I've been pleased. Only time will tell. * I was very skeptical to try this and was shocked. It is so good. 47 year old combo skin, apply with real techniques dense brush and its better than high end.

I actually found it quite drying. I love HG products and am so glad Ulta is carrying them. I hope they'll carry the newer HG skin tint so I can try that one. * Im 55 and my skin is very dry, this product is moisturizing and never settles in my pores , an excellent alternative to foundation which just sat on my skin, this tinted moisturizer does not do that. I would highly recommend this product- * I have never had so many compliments about my skin since using this tinted moisturizer! It may not be for anyone needing full coverage makeup but someone looking for a glow and slight coverage! * It was very hard to find something for my aging skin that is full coverage, but doesn't settle into lines and look caked on. this was recommended in store and I absolutely love it! I apply with a beauty blender and use shape tape concealer with a tiny bit of setting powder. Really makes a difference being hyaluronic and any pictures while wearing come out great. A must in my drawer. * I wanted to like this. I have dry skin and some creepiness at 52. This made all of that worse.

It's very thick and kinda hard to blend out even with moisturizer and primer. 
I had to return this and buy the Too Faced brand hydrating liquid foundation. * Several comments said this was medium to full coverage which made me want to try it and it is not. There is absolutely no coverage at all. If anything it's just a glorified moisturizer so I'm thinking those other comments were for a different product. * Absolutely one of my favorite foundation.

Bait and switch advertising...not cool. * The discontinued gold compact was perfectly thin and light weight, making it easy to carry everyday. Also great for touch-ups when mineral foundation SPF is needed out in the sun! The closing latch wasn't super secure but I never had a problem with it opening in my purse. The new design is thick and super heavy. It's beautiful to sit on a counter, but useless weight for travel or carried in a shoulder bag. So sad I never odered backs up of the slim gold-tone compact! * I was surprised how expensive this compact is. But I have had so many contacts break and then I get crumbled pressed powder. This one looks like it will hold up well. I will let you know the first time I drop it-Yikes! * Very happy with this new compact. My JI mineral foundation stores securely,  the compact opens easily and now has a mirror. Yay! * I am a loyal Jane Iredale brand user. In fact, I have been using their products for over 20 years. The Jane Iredale line was recommended to me by the surgeon who did facial reconstruction after skin cancer surgery. 

Although I love their products, I have always been ""ehh"" about their packaging....until now! Thanks for finally giving up the gaudy gold (sorry, Jane Iredale) and going with this new, modern and aesthetically pleasing line of packaging. Since I have several of the old gold compacts, including the gold metals ones, I ordered one of the new compacts to see how I would like it. After receiving the new compact, I cannot wait to replace ALL my older versions! 

One more suggestion... in your future development, please consider making your eye shadows available in refills. I love the idea of being kinder to our planet and saving on the excess packaging. I do not mind paying separately for the cases if I know if is making a smaller, greener impact for future generations. =)

One final note of thanks to Ulta...I have been begging my local store to start carrying Jane Iredale. I am glad to see that you are at least finally carrying this amazing, clean line of makeup online! * I bought this on sale and I'm glad I did. It just makes it nice to put your foundation in. For the price of the foundation, it's a shame you have to purchase compact separately. * This packaging is overpriced and by default should be included with the powder. Waste of money."

The issue is the pump… it does not pull product well after tube is no longer full and it doesn't come off. So its just wasted product. * Of course it doesn't fully cover blemishes, its not full coverage. I buy this again & again & pair it with concealer for under eyes / blemishes , & blush. Its so smooth, never breaks out my acne prone skin. I love it so much!! * Honestly I hate foundation, I have super sensitive skin and anything can break me out easily. This foundation is SO NICE!! It is more like a skin tint than a foundation, which I prefer if I do ever wear it, the smell is relaxing (if you're not an essential oil person I wouldn't recommend, the lavender is pretty strong), and it doesn't feel like anything is on. For my Florida girls this stuff is a great quick fix for the hot and humid days!! * I have super sensitive, rosacea-prone skin & my eyes are really easily irritated by makeup (ocular rosace) that started a few years ago - suddenly I couldn't wear my favorite makeup without breaking out, & my eyes burning, bright red. I searched & finally found a brand specifically for rosacea-prone skin! So happy to be able to wear makeup again! Over the last year or so the formula clearly changed - I couldn't find a color match & then my eyes started to  burn again. Back to the search - finally found this - I love this foundation & the whole product line! It's light & looks great - as others have said, I look like myself, only better! It doesn't settle in my lines or pores, doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It does feel a bit oily / has a bit of shine. Also, Nude 3 is a perfect color match for me when it goes on, but it does darken a bit across the day so I'm going to try 2.5 & save 3 for the summer. Otherwise, highly recommend!! * I bought this foundation and love it.  I'm 47 years old with dry and pigmented skin from aging and I like light coverage products due to aging skin look more natural than full coverage foundation.  Very moisturizing.  I still set with loose powder and yes would buy this as long as nudestix still made this. * I got this product in shades light3 it a good tinted moisturizer with light to medium at most.  Great for dry skin.  Love this product."

I purchased the Fair Lady T1N and this just.. it's awesome. It does dry down fast and blending becomes near impossible after, but with my combo skin, this is wonderful. I live in Maine and this foundation doesnt budge in the winter or the summer. One thing I will say is that if you have dry skin, this foundation won't be user-friendly. I typically have oil on my nose and forehead, with a dry chin. I lightly exfoliate my face, apply toner, then follow it up by a light non-cream moisturizer, and that solves the problem. * I was hoping this product would perform close to the Becca foundation that you can no longer get.
It's OK but not a go to foundation. It's more watery in my opinion and coverage has to be worked on quite a bit. 
I am sorry, but for me it's not what I was hoping for. * I dont teally wear foundation but gor aome reaaon wanted to try  this one and it was on sale . I am SO happy with it ! It wasnt heavy and it didnt cake up !  I am beyond happy * I LOVE this, I currently have 9 foundations(yes I counted) that I rotate through and I wish I found this sooner. I love how it lays on my face and makes my 42 year old skin look amazing. I will say that it will pill if you do not let your primer set. * I got shade TN1. The formula is great- relatively clean, with a soft matte finish. It also did not upset my very sensitive skin. This would be one of the BEST foundations if the color wasn't so wrong. If you can find a shade that works, go for it"
150,j.cat beauty,aquasurance compact foundation,pimprod2000221,2550026," * This is my favorite powder foundation formula and has been for years - goes on so smoothly and is buildable. The last few compacts I've bought have cracked from barely any use. I had to dump the powder into a different container and use it that way. * so I do a full face every day. every once in a while I'll ""cheat"" and use this product to save time. it works sooo well. I use a light shade which I chose by pretty much matching my neck/highlight areas and use it mainly in my T zone. highlighting under eyes, forehead between brows chin and then I also add it along my jawline. then I go about my routine as normal but without the need for foundation highlight and baking. saves so much time! it builds well and has amazing coverage. it lasts all day. I have mature skin and hate when things settle into fine lines and wrinkles and I do not have that problem with this. it actually makes my skin appear younger compared to my full face routine with baking etc. I know I hav to find a new foundation to help avoid it but who has the time lol anyway... YES. this product is one I want to hoard in case it ever goes away. it's amazing. I use it with a compact dense brush. 

only downside is that I broke 2... but it's because I throw it in my purse and I know that's not ideal and on me for being careless. but if it's getting tossed around, be aware the powder may break. * This is a must have in my kit! I use it to lightly set my foundation and it transforms my face! I have also used it as a powder foundation for summer days and it is flawless! * This is the best powder foundation i have ever tried, i reach for this one over my high end one. Its my go to during the summer months. * Medium to full coverage. I like to carry it in my bag for touch ups because it covers the redness around the nose, i can cover up some my blemishes that peak out after wearing makeup all day etc * I use the shade Natural and I absolutely love this powder. i've used mine all the way to the pan and just restocked a new one. Literally the most beautiful blurring coverage, doesn't feel cakey or drying and my skin looks flawless. Great for on the go and quick touch ups. I usually hate the feeling of wearing heavy foundations and powders so once I found this it was over. Super breathable and comfortable and evens out my skin tone in a couple quick pass overs. I love this product. * Medium to high coverage, smoothing, non-comedogenic. Its a bit hard to shade match. I use Soft Tan in this powder and Nars Valencia, Lisa Eldridge 19, Estee Lauder 4w1."
151,revlon,illuminance skin-caring foundation,pimprod2036478,2605534," * This is better than expensive brand that claims to be skin caring. Does not oxide. I also find color matching my skin is challenging, but I found a shade that perfectly matches me in this line. * I love this foundation, I'm on my third or fourth bottle! I like that it is paraben free, affordable, has beautiful natural looking medium coverage, is hydrating, and actually has shades that match my medium yellowy-olive skin tone.
It looks like my bare skin but more even. I can't speak to the longevity because I don't really pay attention to that, haha. 
Yes it does totally smell like what you would paint your wall with! I'm willing to put up with it for an affordable paraben free option that actually matches my skin. * I love this and would buy it again... only a shade lighter. * Got this foundation about 2 weeks ago… just don't even look into this product. Maybe l'm having bad luck but it smells like paint, it creases SO EASILY I have to powder my face immediately after just to avoid it and then it STILL creases. The foundation comes off way to

Its patchy and gross feeling. * I wore this last night and actually liked how it applied (first time I tried it, it did pill) and wore. Woke up this morning with a forehead full of bumps :( I know there are benefits for some, but the niacinamide really messed with my skin * This would be my holy grail foundation IF it wasn't so frustrating to apply. I have extremely dry skin and this tint gives just enough coverage to make my skin look radiant and healthy. It does not transfer, does not stick to or accentuate dry spots, and the shade range goes light enough for me, which usually isn't the case for tints with limited shades. HOWEVER, this stuff is an absolute nightmare to apply. If you accidentally touch it with your brush or sponge after it dries down (which takes only a few seconds), it will pill and come off your face. The only way I've found to fix this is to remove it and start over. Maybe I'm applying it wrong, but I've tried different primers, applicators, etc., all with the same result. I really wish it wasn't so hard to apply because I love the finish, but I won't be repurchasing because of this. * I have sensitive, oily, and redness-prone skin, so moisturizers usually dont work on me. Im plesently suprised on how well this works with my skin chemistry. The coverage is very much buildable, some days i put just a tiny bit on to moisturize and even out my skin-tone, othertimes i build it up for more coverage. Only downside is the occasional pilling that others here mentioned, but its subtle enough. * I love this.  I apply after i ise a moisturizer.  Provides supermligbt coverage to even out skin tone. I use the shade 15 which has a yellow indertone rather than red. * It has great ingredients but it jusy peels right off the face. It doesnt stick at all it immediatly pills its unwearable which sucks cuz i love the ingredients"

Gives me s youthful, even skin tone. * I honestly loved the product itself, unfortunately I just couldn't find my shade. My skin looked very smooth and it was great on my combination skin! * This product has gotten a lot of hype on social media, and I'm not sure why. It is extremely THICK and goopy as heck. I didn't like the feeling it gave me, almost sticky. It sat so heavy on my face. If you don't mind that, this might be great. But I like my makeup to not feel like I am wearing a mask or film on my face. I will pass on this. * I have been looking for a light Tinted foundation with SPF. This one is amazing.  It covers just enough without you feeling overly made up. It was on sale andvi do not regret trying it out. I will buy it again. * I have gotten many compliments at work about my skin since using this product. My skin is plumper, softer, radiant and smoother. Hint when applying make sure your skin is moisturized and use a sponge to apply or it will pile if you rub it to much. * I love the no makeup only skin effect I get with this product.  Evens my skin tone and mixes well with my sunscreen * I'm usually a prestige foundation only girly but this worked great for me. Its great for a light foundation or light coverage days. It helped even out my skin tone. It is nice but it will get into wrinkles like the one I have in the middle of my brow. However, I just pat it down and call it a day. Nice product for the price range."

I mostly love the dewy finish. * I thought at firstctgis was a primer when i tried it because it was so light and had wonderful coverage and was hydrating. Great for older skin! * First time trying this product but I will get more * I absolutely love this tint for the summer. Apply with a brush for higher coverage, about two layers. I struggle with acne scars, in those areas I apply glossier concealer and feel satisfied. During the winter I see myself applying this for running errands or more lowkey events. I get a lot of compliments with this tint at this time of the year for its radiance. * I've been using this for a little over a month and was having postpartum breakouts prior to it, thsi helped soothe my skin and stopped mh breakouts. I work in a cooler all day so trust this helps my skin! * I will say that I have used this product in the past. Its not too bad for the price of the product. However, the coverage is very light and not really buildable. Although, I do like how it gives a somewhat dewy effect. I also like how it has clean ingredients! So if you like dewy foundation, light coverage, and clean ingredients then this product might be for you. * I rarely wear foundation, largely because I hate how heavy it feels on my face, and I also love my freckles and foundations tend to cover them. I bought this out of curiosity and I'm surprisingly happy with the result! It's a pretty watery consistency, but that means A) a little goes a long way, especially when applied with a foundation brush, and B) it feels so light on my face!! It evened out my skin tone (as someone with vitiligo, this is always a big win!!) without totally covering my freckles. It looks super natural, too. I appreciate the price for the amount of product and the fact that it has no scent. 

The one con for me is that my nose felt kind of greasy a few hours later—but the rest of my face felt pretty dry, so that could just be my overactive pores LOL.

For reference, I am very pale (and I have vitiligo). I'm using shade 520- Fair."

It also looks a bit cakey but i highly recomend spraying do we setting spray onto your brush/sponge, and then blending out. * I normally wear Estee stay matte foundation but I was out and until it arrived I needed something in the meantime. I wore this out, was standing in the parking lot talking to my friends and some random lady walked up to us and said ""sorry to interupt but I just have to tell you, you are stunning"" ( she was talking to me) And then she walked off. I was never told that when I wore the Estee! What the heck, this stuff is GOLD. * I have been using this foundation for 5 years now. I will say it is not full coverage but it is buildable. This foundation feels so lightweight & it gives such a natural look. I've tried other foundations but always come back to this one cause its just so good! I tend to have an oily T-zone & everywhere else is pretty much dry but this foundation doesn't ever really cake or flake on me. I 100% recommend this foundation for an everyday natural look! * I love this foundation! it's affordable and stays on all throughout the work day * this foundation is surprisingly good for the price. it's buildable, smooth, and has a nice matte but natural finish. it flaked on my chin area after a few hours, but that could be my skin type. * Love this for my combo skin. I'm not extremely oily but I needed something that would actually last throughout the day without needing to powder by midday. I actually like it better than the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I am shade 090 in Lancome but have not been able to find a good color match as 090 is too light and the next shades are too dark and orange. I have very fair neutral skin. I prefer how the covergirl looks, it is very smooth with slightly better coverage, and L20 is a great shade and a closer match than the Lancome (maybe L20 is a dash too light but it looks perfect after bronzer). It gives a natural matte finish that doesn't cling or look cakey. Works well on my middle-age skin with fine lines. Has great medium-full coverage. Highly recommend! * I really love this foundation and I will continue to purchase it! Affordable and covers well."

It did get a bit shiny though. * My skin is more dry during the winter months! So far so good i love the coverage and the shade was perfect for me.

But this is noy for dry skin. * It broke the second I tapped my brush on it. Then it was impossible to blend out on my face and ruined my makeup ): * I love this powder this is the best powder that I have discovered as of lately. Elf kills it with all the products they release but this is top tier. * I really wanted to like this product, but even though I moisturize my skin, it leaves randow streaks on my face, as if i applied it with a paint brush. And leaves weird marks on my nose that I cant blend out and have to literally use my nails to scratch off. I have oily skin and never experienced this with a powder foundation. * I have fair skin and got the recommended color. It's too yellow for me and honestly isn't as good as the dermablend camo. I only got it because I can't find the dermablend camo anywhere. This doesn't stay on my skin very well and rubs off so easily. * I am 39 years old, and I have struggled to find a powder foundation that would work for my combo skin, I have spent tons of money, looked high and low, and have never been happy with anything that I found in the past. I could not believe how well, this held up for me! I am 39 years old and I had a baby nine months ago and don't have much time to do my make up but I still wanna look half decent when I have to go out of the house and this is quick and easy and effortless, I highly recommend this to anybody who cannot seem to find a powder foundation that works for them, maybe you might meet your match with this one. I do use the little sponge that comes with the powder because it works for me and I don't want to try to mess withthe system lol. * If your ever going for a simple quick look thsi is the foundation powder to use, the shade match is incredible accurate,decent coverage for a sinple quick look. I definitely recommend!!"
162,ulta beauty collection,velvet matte longwear foundation,pimprod2020823,2560234," * This came completely separated. So I tried mixing the best I could inside the tube and when I applied it to my face it's literally impossible to blend into the skin. * This foundation is definitely not for beginners. Its not lightweight, and could be tricky to apply. I'm someone who needs a heavier foundation becasue my face gets super oily, so I've had experiences with thicker foundations. I like to apply it with my fingers, and then blend it in with a damp sponge. It lasts pretty long, especially with a setting powder and is a heavy duty foundation. I wouldn't recommend this product if you have dry or normal skin, but its a pretty good option for skin that needs some oil control, especially for the price. 

The thing I don't like about it is that the colors look too yellow on me (even the lightest shades) and that it starts to make my pores more visible after some time. * I would look like one of those powdered face men from the 1800s if i wore this. * This foundation came and did exactly what it said it would and did not disappoint. Definitely pleased with the application and effect of coverage. Obviously anything works best if you have a daily skin prep-care routine like priming and moisturizing, especially since this is full coverage as opposed to a soft focus/medium coverage. 
**
-If you have dry skin and don't moisturize it's not going to have the desired velvety and blurred consistency, especially over pores and anywhere your skin creases. You won't have to worry about reapplying but if you need to blot or erase an oily area, it looks fantastic when paired with an adjustable coverage powder foundation!!
-No need to worry about concealer since it's basically built in. 
-Also, for anyone who is used to set-spraying each layer of face makeup just keep in mind it's a thicker liquid and sets in tight so just be sure to finish blending anything else before setting it. 
-Typically this product blends best with either fingers or a silicone sponge - anything it cant seep or dry into. * The texture of this was not good. I didn't "" use a primer, but I never do and there usually isn't a problem. * Picked this up on a whim. I thought it would be similar to MUFE Matte Velvet Skin because of the name, but it's more comparable to Huda Beauty Faux Filter foundation IMO. Very thick and not the easiest to blend, especially down your neck or in the creases of your nose. It starts drying basically the moment you put it on your face, which doesn't help with blending. Bought shade Fair Cool and it goes on practically white, but does dry down darker.

An okay foundation for the price you pay, but there are better ones out there. * This foundation is incredibly thick, making it hard to blend. My face looks overly dry, even with moisturizer and primer."

I live in Italy and was introduced to this brand by one of my girlfriends.All of their stuff is amazing. This foundation is great but definitely runs a bit warmer than I expected. I'm usually light neutral or 35N and grabbed shade 30N, it was darker than expected and waaaay too yellow on me. * I love this foundation * I was hesitant at first ,because I just heard from this brand but I'm glad i gave it a try. And it was on sale 😁 felt good on my face. I used it and yes it was worth it the staying power  was good specially of your from az. * Have a hard time matching foundation to my skin tone and this matches me perfectly. It looks natural and has buildable coverage. For the price, you cannot beat it, I own foundations double the price and this is now my go to. Give it a shot. :D * I bought this like a month ago and I love it! You dont have to use a lot and literally your face is flawless. One of the things i love about this product is it doesnt dry out your skin. I got the shade neutral 25 and id say that its a mix of fair and tan. I also really love the application part of it, the wand is really nice!!! * Covers a lot without having to apply a ton. Love the application wand * I love this foundation I find myself reaching for it more  often than the others. it's not drying, not greasy,  the coverage looks like my skin but glowy, and not cakey. The kiko Milano powder is awesome too for baking BTW. This foundation is way very similar to TF Born this way foundation, (but not as greasy) kiko milano is underrated IMO. Yes I would recommend."
164,well people,bio stick foundation,pimprod2008575,2553269," * The old formula truly was the best, I looked forward to applying it every morning.  Blended like a dream, gorgeous satin finish, blurred imperfections, clean and fragrance free.  The color 1C was actually a cool tone, this new 1C is PEACH toned....very warm, and the formula change truly makes me sad....it's not the same. They ruined a perfect product. * I absolutely love this product! The smell is a bit strong and the application is a little off-putting, but it blends great and looks great! I found that instead of using a traditional primer like elf power grip, using a setting spray to prime made application easier and blending smoother. * My skin looked worse with this. Highlighying pores no matter how much or how many different methods i use. And shows every bump, dry patch, etc. its so weird. Like the opposite of why we wear makeup in the first place. So mad i was fooled that im writing a review * I have very fair and pink skin and have always had trouble finding foundations that match my tone, never mind work well on my oily/combination skin, but I will say that this one does a good job! I was nervous buying online without match testing, but I got the 1C and would say its a pretty good match for my skin tone. 

My pros for this are definitely: generaly matches my skin, works well with my oily/combination skin, it coming in a stick format is very convenient and mess free, stays on very well, looks natural, and doesnt make my skin feel gross

My cons would be: not the perfect match (wish the undertones were more p and that the shade was slightly lighter), can get a little cakey if i put too much on, and a little hard to blend. 

For context I've been wearing Too Faced Born this way foundation in the shade Snow for years now because it's the only foundation I've found that comes close to matching my skin, but I've always run into the same problem of not being able to apply the foundation too thick because then you can tell it's not a true match. Anyway, I would say overall thi one does a better job, has better ingredients, feels better on my skin, and is a good price point.

My last points would be dont let the 1 star reviews scare you, this foundation is very nice and as long as you use a wet sponge to apply and don't mind the mild scent of castor oil that fades in about 30 minutes :) * The old formula was amazing.  Shade 1C was a perfect cool tone as described.  This newer version is very peach in tone and no longer qualifies as cool toned.  So  if you are a fair, cool toned person...look elsewhere. * I have come back to this product again and again after trying other hydrating foundations that are too thin and messy or settle into pores. This is my favorite non-SPF foundation. It is like a natural version of cover girl compact makeup. It's vegetable oil based so it does smell like olive oil. But it's so nourishing and convenient with the solid stick. It smooths on well to a medium coverage and natural dewy finish that doesn't settle into my pores or cause breakouts for me. And with a light powder to set, it stays all day. I do wish they had lighter shades as the lightest warm (2W) is a bit dark for me in winter. But I'm a repeat customer of this good clean dry skin foundation option. * This brand is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I live in the desert and ingredients like hyaluronic acid just pull the water out of your skin because there's no water in the air here. It seemed like every make up and skincare brand hopped on that train and I couldn't find anything for my skin (dry) and climate type. I hope they never change the formula! I'm almost 30 and I'm starting to get crows ft etc and this really does a great job of camouflage without settling in any wrinkles."

Pleas eplease being this back because Good Apple is not close at all in coverage and wear. * This was the only matte foundation i found that made my textred mature skin not look more textured and makes me look older like all other matte foundations I've tried! This one looks so amazing. Stayed all day and i sweat alot on my face. I really dont know why they got rid of this foundation. I literally have not one bad thing to say about this foundation.

169,lorac,pro soft focus longwear foundation,pimprod2013331,2558415," * This is my new favorite foundation,
! It has excellent coverage with a natural finish. I have dry skin but find a lot of the hydrating foundations transfer and/or leave my skin looking oily by the end of the day, this foundation looks good all day and doesn't transfer. It does have a incredibly potent smell that lingers long after it dries, but I have been able to get used to it and I only notice when during application. * Although I like this foundation in everyway I have to give a low score because it isn't CRUELTY FREE.   There is no good reason for testing on animals and there are plenty of good products available which ARE CRUELTY FREE too. * I purchased this on a whim as i saw it on sale. I received it at the same time another package with the new Prada foundation came in, and I'm shocked that i like the Lorac foundation more than the Prada!  I applied this with my Hourglass foundation brush as the formula is quite thin amd it went on beautifully. Its so smooth and the finish really is a soft matte. It seems to be very long lasting as well. My first favorite foundation of the year. * I finally got my hands on this foundation and I wore it and loved it right away! I will say if you're sensitive to smells it does smell like paint but it will fade. This foundations lasts all day and blurred my acne scared skin & pores. obsessed! * Lorac left no choice but to select this when they quit making the PoreFection foundation.  This has no sunscreen and it has an odor similar to molasses. I use it because it doesn't break my face out. * I love it one of the reasons I love it is because it doesn't crease and settle in my  lines and it's very very hard to find products they don't do that. I can't get over the coverage when I first tried it I was so skeptical, because it is runny and well, it just didn't seem like it was gonna be that great…! And it is in my opinion…  To apply it I use a beauty blender and it goes on amazing and for me honestly a little bit goes a long way. … I have large pores texturize skin, but yet this one seems to work good for me and not feel too heavy.… I wouldn't say it's totally water resistant, but good enough because let me tell you I've cried while having it on and it does not streak not at all at least not for me and like I said,  I'm almost 46 years old. I'm a 45 year old woman so it's been a struggle for me and I know other people have been saying a lot of different things then I am saying, but I know for me personally it is one of my favorites and always will be! And I highly recommend for more mature skin… I really really do … I have used a brush with it before and it does work good as well. Not a matte either. Just a beautiful natural finish not too dewy. Put it to you this way whenever I use the Lorac foundation, I always get compliments oh, and before I forget, it does not crease on my eyelids, and that is one of my biggest pet peeves ever 😂. * Since the perfection foundation was discontinued I thought this pro version would somehow be better. It is not. It is very heavy coverage and cakes on. It truely smells like maple syrup. Laura Mercier makes a tinted moisturizer w SPF that is more like porefection formerly by Lorac."

It's the old school sort--the kind that feels very waxy.  If you have dry skin, you will not be pleased.  It's very hard to get the finish to look good, and even harder to get it to stay looking good.  It's probably not going to save you time or make your life easier on the go. * I am blown away by how amazing this stick foundation is!! It gives a barely there feeling which i love. It does not settle into fine lines and stays on all day. Can't wait to try more stuff from the brand!!! * This stick goes on sooo smoothly! Absolutely love the consistency of this makeup! My skin looked like a barely there makeup look, exactly what i was going for. Definitely need to extend the shade range of this makeup but other than that this stuff is amazing!! * great coverage for my skin tone and felt smooth.  please add more skin tones so all people can have it. * this shade range has every type of tone for lighter skin but for 1 dark complexion do better * I honestly dont unserstand why people who've never tried this give it a low rating due to the shade range. This is an Italian owned brand. Majority of the population is olive, light to medium skintones. Many of them/us have a hard time finding our shades. Go try Fenty Beauty if you dont like it. Anyways, this is fantastic. Super blendable and looks smooth on my texture. * the shade range is disgusting. its not like italy is a sheltered country or anything, many POC reside there. darker women, men, and all in between deserve to have products that fit their skin too. do better."
171,maybelline,instant age rewind perfector 4-in-1 whipped matte makeup,pimprod2028923,2590459," * Its like it never dries and doesnt stick to your skin. So skin ends up looking splotchy. Wipes off easily and blends with nothing. Won't purchase again! * I have combination skin, super oily with dry patches. I hate the feeling of foundation so I just prefer something super light to even out my color and mattify me. This stuff is perfect! It feels completely weightless and looks natural. It wears off gradually by the end of the day without looking crazy. Definitely my favorite face makeup! * It wiped off easily didn't  stay on my face. I would use it in a certain spot and i would try and apply it somewhere else and it would wipe off * As for color match, it's perfect. But it doesn't really cover up my imperfections like age spots * Looks great on my skin. * Very light coverage. Feels so light and soft on skin. Not oily after a full day of wear! Doesn't cover blemishes the best but will give a nice even tone over the skin. Blends nicely! * I loved this! Its very light weight. I used under this my normal skin car rountine. And i wear elf glow sunscreen and halo glow with this bb cream and i loved the result. I do use conceler as well. And i dont feel caked on. Honestly try this method."
172,flower beauty,get real serum foundation,pimprod2022967,2577491," * I absolutely love this foundation! It is even better then the very high end products i have purchased.  Hydrated, natural looking skin is what my aging skin looks like when using it. I cannot believe what an absolute bargain this foundation is. I would gladly pay triple the price. I hope they never stop making it! * Moisturizing and glowy with light coverage, this foundation plays well with powder and cream cheek products on top. It does not layer itself well (looks very textured), however. No other complaints, as long as you like light coverage glow with a single layer of product I'd say you have found the best product in the market in this price range! Also stays preserved well, in case you're soemone that takes a while to go through product. * I LOVED the Light Illusion foundation! Then I tried this. WHAT a letdown. It is runny, thin, has NO coverage. THE COLOR( I wear L2  IVORY in Light Illusion) is also DARKER than LIGHT ILLUSION. The L2 Ivory is the same as the L4 warm beige. * I bought this on a whim on sale because ive heard good things and actually really like other flower products BUT this is was a let down I understand its a ""serum"" fondation and not meant to provide coverage thats fine what I DIDNT LIKE was the fact that i could not get this to stick to my skin it transferred and moved around and good luck trying to apply anything on top of it * I love serum foundations and this one did not disappoint! This one is up there with the more high end serum foundations in every way but without the crazy price tag. It is sheer - exactly what I like! - and blends like a dream. It has staying power and flattering shades. A little goes a long way. It plays well with other products both cream and powder. No moisturizer needed as it is very hydrating - my dry mature skin drinks this up and loves it! Very happy! * I've got combination skin with an oily t-zone and dry on my forehead and underneath my eyes, this doesn't bring any of this texture out! It's light coverage which I like for daily wear and for hot days. * It's so light! Def what I was looking for. Just a psa to anyone who wants to buy this, I'd suggest buying at AT THE store because I ordered it and received it with the product spilled. Still product in the bottle, but I for some reason can't put it sideways or it leaks. So if you order it online, be aware either the bottle is just awful or it broke while it was shipping to me. 
Other than that it's a wonderful product"
173,pacifica,ultra cc cream radiant foundation with 100% physical broad spectrum spf 17,pimprod2026038,2582152," * this doesn't blend well at all. it's streaky, it doesn't cover, it smells odd. it's just a horrible horrible product. * I have used this foundation for years but the formula has changed, and it is awful. It is so thick it won't pump out. The foundation is clumpy and doesn't spread at all. Why did they change a good product???? * This foundation is worth trying! Creamy, spreads nicely (I use a brush), nice colour matching (I consider myself a medium brown skin colour). Overall great product! * I cannot say enough GOOD THINGS about this CC cream. There comes the point when foundation is out, and CC cream is in, and I am pleased with this product's color choices, smooth texture, and luminescence. I mix two shades and apply the first color as a primer. This CC cream doubles as my concealer; it's that easy to apply. * This product: separates BADLY and doe not blend well at all; Smells weird and chemical-y; offers VERY little coverage, even for a CC cream, and is overpriced because of all these factors. Positives: it makes skin glowy and has SPF. I wouldn't buy this personally - Pacifica's skincare and fragrance are AMAZING, but makeup seems to be a weak point. * This product came out separated. Tried shaking product to get product mixed together and it came out somewhat like foundation. Does not go on skin nicely. Do not recommend. * it comes out as a clear oil with little specs of color that don't blend."

It is so hard for ne to find something that works for my skin and this has been amazing. * A gift card & a sale gave me this dream coverage. I am absolutely in love. This breathable, light satin finish can be set up on itself until youve found your inner teenage beauty queen! It's perfect for my skin type & it smells lovely too. A+ Ulta! * I love this lightweight easy to apply buildable foundation.  And so easy to match my complexion. * it appears that this foundation is being discontinued & I'm so upset. i have 51 y.o. mature, incredibly dry skin. this foundation is so wonderful & I have never found anything comparable. i need this in my makeup arsenal!!! * Please don't discontinue this item! It's the only foundation that works for my mature skin. It goes on so nice and smooth and cover just enough. Please please PLEASE bring back some of the lighter colors. * I bought this over the holidays and LOVED it!! Goes on easily and is weightless. Soooo disappointed to see that my shade is not available. Please do not discontinue this product. * My perfect shade is Light to Medium Cool.  Not available the last 2 times I've tried to buy.  What's up with that.  Not everybody needs a dark shade.  I would venture to say there are more who want lighter shades. Love the silky formula!"

I was not expecting to fall in love with this product, but it's truly flawless. I have NEVER had a shade match me so accurately. This product is buildable and can be worn for 100% full coverage or as a tint. The color is pigmented enough to cover dark undereye without concealer for a very natural ""no makeup"" finish. The price is a steal lol * I have never had a more perfect color match in my entire life. I show this to the older women in my family and you would think I was literally doing a magic trick lol shock awe and wonder. I often and loudly recommend this in True Caramel. Perfect for lace on wigs or just on skin * The foundation is very smooth and moisturizing.  It provides medium coverage, so I build it by applying several applications to get a more full coverage.  It is a great product for the price. * I have purchased this product before and I liked it. This time the product was used. It had a finger smudge print on it when l opened it and the sponge applicator had make all on one side. I ended up purchasing something else at another store. * First, note this has the ingredients that Danessa Myricks uses for her foundation at an affordable cost. This provides a great shade match, makes skin look healthy and even, easy to take with you and stays on even if you sweat. The magnesium carbonate in the formula absolutely is wonderful for sweaty moments. I just find you can't really apply it with anything other than a sponge. Brushes with dense round tops don't pick it up well, as nothing else does. If you don't want to buy a beauty sponge you'll be fine to use the one it comes with. * Great shade for Hispanic women."

Gives amazing coverage and keeps foundation matte all day. Ive repurchased this over 6 times. * It is a wonderful color. Goes on so smooth.  It did come in broken. Was quite sad about that. It is still useable but very disappointing on the breakage. * Has a matte finish and keeps makeup on for a long period of time. * Unfortunately, I feel like essence has slowly started to decline over the years, this is the second powder from them that I have not liked. The powder did not blend well under my eyes at all, and instead turned cakey immediately. I tried putting it on other areas like my forhead and cheeks and it was the same issue. I had to go back and get another powder the next day because I couldn't handle it. Also, for some reason, it irritated my skin. I would not recommend this product."
177,blk/opl,pore perfecting liquid foundation,pimprod2022248,2578400," * The consistency of the foundation is wonderful. It's super light and just melts into the skin. The color range is also phenomenal. I've never found a shade that matched me so perfectly. It literally looks like my skin. All of my friends, family members, and coworkers inquire about the foundation I use, and I have to share the link often. * Great foundation for the price. And it has spf! * Matched me perfectly. Wasn't to heavy made me look flawless * Rubs off and oily I bought two hoping to return one * After searching & searching for the perfect blend/shade…..I'm completely satisfied…. * One of my favorite drugstore foundations.

178,l.a. girl,sheer skin tinted foundation,pimprod2025859,2581633," * YALL I SWEAR this is my holy tinted foundation i have ever tried. I have used maybelline bb fresh, covergirl skin milk, covergirl clean matte bb cream, colourpop pretty fresh skin tint, but this is the BEST AFFORDABLE, BEST SHADE RANGE tinted foundation i have ever tried. it feels light and looks so natural. i use shade WARM SAND. (for shade match reference: i also use loreal tinted serum shade 4-5 and the maybelline super stay skin tint in shade 220 & have oily skin) ANYWAYS YALL TRY THIS OUT ITS SO GOOD AND PLEASE NEVER GET RID OF THIS PRODUCT I LITERALLY BEG U GIRL!!! * i wanted something less full coverage, as it would crease in my smile lines, ans this does the trick! its a beautiful finish and lasts my full work shifts! no creasing either!!! * Why would the name be tinted foundation? Isnt all foundation tinted""? Maybe try tinted moisturizer * Light and hydrating product that evens out dull skin without looking heavy! Great for looking put together on minimal makeup days. * The coverage of this bad boy is wat too light to be called a foundation, but it doesnt have any skin care benefits which is I guess why they can't call it BB cream. It's refreshing to have a product with light coverage and a natural finish instead of dewy. Great for no makeup makeup days. * I found the Tawny shade of L.A. Girl Tinted Foundation in my local Ulta's clearance section and figured I'd give it a try. When I got home, I used Ulta's shade matcher and it told me I was really Warm Sand in this product (based off entering Ginger for bareMineral's COMPLEXION RESCUE Tinted Moisturizer Mineral SPF 30). Warm Sand perfectly matches my skin right now during the winter. I'll try Tawny again in the spring/summer, but it was a close match too. I love how lightweight this product feels and how easy it is to apply — I dot it on right from the tube and the dab/blend with a lightly moist makeup sponge. It looks just slightly dewy but doesn't feel overly wet or sticky. It also works well under my bareMinerals BAREPRO 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation if I want to look more made up, but between the price and its natural look when used solo, it fits well with my minimalist approach to makeup. * I am 66 years old. It settled into my wrinkles and emphasized them.  Very sheer coverage. Not a good choice for me."
179,well people,bio powder foundation,pimprod2008579,2553264," * Light, sheer. Shade range is confusing. If unsure, go a bit darker than normal. * I ordered 2W - Warm light - and it was almost white, so light and clearly defective. It did absolutely nothing other than make me have a Casper look. It is so sheer I can't imagine it doing anything even if it was the correct color.  I contacted Well People, I thought they should know how bad the product was, and they didn't care. * W3ll people... we need to talk about the shade range. People with darker skin tones like makeup too yet the shade range completely excludes anyone beyond tan. Thankfully the darkest shade works for me so I enjoy the product but it's hard to get behind a brand that doesn't give darker skintones a thought. * I was really hoping this product would work for me but it didn't. I found the baked foundation to be much more drying than other pressed powders I've previously used. Felt like it didn't go on well and had horrible coverage. Will not be buying again. * Takes forever to build up. Not for anyone who wants medium to full coverage. Light to medium at best. * Honestly if you're looking for a foundation to take a chance on.. this is definitely it. I'm not sure why I even chose to buy this but I love it!! I use it over concealer and it evens out my skin tone perfectly. Also does not make me look too orangey or cakey. * Just meh"

It was so easy to apply, felt nice on my skin, looks natural and I think m10 is my shade - it is spot on (for my beautiful summer complexion ) I'm excited to have found Mented! not a con for me, because i don't choose a makeup to smell good, but definitely seems like fragrance wasn't added.

I have pretty dry sky so I know to add a moisturizer before applying this. I am not saying this drying…but makeup ondry skin can appear patchy * This product feels and looks like you have no product on. * I have searched for the perfect match years! So excited to have finally found a shade so spot on with my skin tone that it's almost scary. The stick foundation is easy to apply, blends well and leaves me a great natural glow. * Looked awful on me. Horrible on oily skin and def dont get if you have light skin. This foundation isnt made for light skin tones which sucks. * Perfect match almost feels like a tinted moisturizer. I'm oily so I still need a powder but for stick makeup it goes on smooth and doesn't run off. I'm sold * Okay so hear me out.. the color match to my skin is amazing!!! it blended beautifully. However, I have combo oily skin and nothing could have prepared me for how shiny and oily this foundation is. This is not a matte foundation so beware!! * Hidden Gem hands down. I have been looking for a good foundation in general for a few years now, I went high end low end drugstore I went tinted moisturizer to full coverage and non did what I actually wanted. I love make up but finding a good foundation for my oily skin that wont force me to re touch (which I'm horrible at by the way, always makes it worse) was close to impossible without making me feel like I have pounds of make up on especially for work. I had tried the Hourglass foundation stick which was highly rated and felt very chalky on my skin. I did a search of stick foundations and came across this one. I am the lightest shade in this line and am on my way to re up for a 3rd time! I have never purchased 1 item more than once since they end up not working out for a while. The coverage is amazing from one layer to a 2 layers if I want a fuller look. It glides on like butter on my skin  and gives me a glow without an oily look if that makes sense. I rarely have to completely set my face because it sets so nice on its own and will literally last me over 9 hours without any cracks or separation and looks like I just applied it minutes ago. It makes my face feel hydrated and not like I'm wearing loads of make up. This is a long review and I never leave a review but I am truly in love with this foundation! I am so thankful for this brand because I am the in between when it comes to make up, I'm a semy fare complexion with neutral undertones. Many lines have a Yellow undertone or an olive undertone which makes me look washed out. This is truly a bang for your buck and will leave your make up looking flawless."

185,mac,studio radiance face and body radiant sheer foundation,pimprod2023387,2579193," * wow. I can go on about this foundation forever. I have very pale, dry skin, this shade range cancels out any issues ive had with light foundations that are too orange, does not stick to or emphasize when i have dryness. I 100% recommend this product. * This doesn't settle in wrinkles like a lot of foundation.  It is a bit hard to use to start with but once you figure it out it's very nice.  Good for older and younger skin.  I'm 64 and it's the best I've ever used. * This foundation is perfect for evening out skin tone without making it look like you painted your make up on. I really love pairing it with cream contour and cream blush, and then just setting it with a setting spray- it gives a gorgeous dewy finish. You can set it with powder to make it a little more long lasting too. I always try to catch it on sale. I think having a gorgeous light coverage foundation like this is perfect for an interview, meeting someone new, or embracing your natural beauty! Its made me feel so much more confident in my own skin. * The origin to my villain story. I listened to an ULTA employee, first foundation for my high school homecoming. Three days later I broke out, having clear skin all my life. Ever since, it never stopped. I had to go on meds to cure my acne. Don't use. * I used to use the old face and body without the radiance and always loved it so im not surprised I love the new version especially because I like more of a sheen/glow to my skin. This is a very sheer coverage foundation but is buildable if you want a little more coverage. Also I can apply this over my skincare without it pilling! * I never tried the original face and body. Honestly, I was never interested in this foundation until I started watching Miss Megan Robinson on tik tok. Seriously you NEED to follow her!! I generally have oily skin. It's been a lot more calm, and a lot less oily after I got rid of all the actives, and JUST started washing, toning, and using AN OIL (I know right, but it's true, oil loves oil, using an oil will keep your skin from producing a lot of oil) I can now wear this foundation confidently, and it is BEAUTIFUL!! It's friction activated so I suggest applying with fingers and rubbing it in so you can start to feel the ""gripping and thickening"" action that happens with this foundation(which is the best most fun part for me). The coverage is obviously light but it looks like perfected skin. Only the best things are peeking through. Everything blends nicely on top, and I mean EVERYTHING, from all different brands. It wears great too and looks even better as the day goes on. Its softly radiant and skin like if you powder (which I still do) and if you don't you'll look like a freshly hot glazed donut (some people like that, some people don't) I get the hype of this foundation and dare I say it's made it into my top 5 line up!!?? Coming from an oily girl that is shocking. If you're wondering, I use the Danessa Myricks yummy skin balm in translucent as a primer, this foundation, all my other creams and liquids, and I set with Mac studio fix powder and one size setting spray. PERFECTED NATURAL RADIANT SKIN * Wear it everyday and have received unprovoked complements."
186,vdl,perfect lasting foundation,pimprod2006000,2560248," * I LOVE this foundation! It's definitely full coverage. It look so beautiful like natural skin! It doesn't dry matte, so definitely set it with powder. I'd say a little goes a long way! It last all day & still look beautiful even after a workout. The only areas that would slightly crease would be around my smile lines & chin but nothing crazy. I wish the foundation would be more available but it's so hard to find & the shade range isn't the best but overall 10/10 I would recommend! My closest shade is A05.5. I also tried mixing V05 & V04 to get my shade if anyone is wondering. I hope this helps.  :) * Coming from an Ulta Employee, after trying every foundation under the sun, this foundation makes my skin look FLAWLESS, airbrushed, smooth. I do have to set with a translucent loose powder because it is still a little tacky in my opinion. Shades are FANTASTIC. A02 matches me the closest; however if there was a slightly paler shade with a yellow undertone that would be my perfect match. I ordered A01 and A02 on YesStyle and to me 1 was almost darker than 2, but it may just be the undertones. ULTA PLEASE BRING THIS BACK. It took me over a week with express shipping on YS btw I paid $19 extra FYI In case anyone was going to order it, I think it ships from China. Idk what is in this foundation but  I want to buy every bottle just incase it ever gets discontinued😅😭😭😭 * My relationship with foundation is a nightmare,I'm a brown skin girl with golden undertones in the summer and pale skin in the winter,without much prep this foundation matched me perfectly and stayed on ALL NIGHT,the a night of dancing 💕LOVE THIS STUFF * Please restock ASAP! This is my favorite foundation!! I literally bought 3 bottles because I have a feeling Ulta might discontinue this foundation...
 FYI- you can still find VDL on Yesstyle BUT it's NOT the same foundation. The one on Yesstyle has SPF & it has more of a dewy finish 😩 * I hope Ulta is not going to stop selling this foundation. It is an amazing satin finish foundation. Looks flawless on the skin and makes blemished skin look smooth. Wears beautifully throughout the day and is full coverage. Highly recommend. FYI if they stop selling it at Ulta you can find it on YesStyle. * I bought this foundation in the color A06. I tend to have a hard time finding foundations because I am in the weird shade range where I'm typically between medium/tan and dark/deep in various brands. I have Neutral slightly golden/olive undertones and find that many brands get close but not perfectly my shade. Most times foundations are too golden (almost orange looking), too cool, exactly neutral when I need just a touch of yellow in the foundation, or they just skip my shade altogether. I was pleasantly surprised when this foundation was an exact match. I love the natural finish to this foundation. I have dehydrated combo skin that if not properly hydrated will get oily in the t-zone (mostly nose area) and will remain normal or slightly dry everywhere else. When I wear this for several hours my foundation goes from very natural to radiant but not oily as my t-zone starts to break into a bit of a shine. I really don't have anything bad to say about this foundation except because of the limited shade range there's a chance you may not find a good match depending on your skin tone and undertone. Hopefully Ulta continues to keep this foundation available. * I would describe this foundation on my skin as full coverage with a satin/slight dewy finish. I have acne prone skin with acne scars and this foundation covers everything without causing any texture. Long wearing and mask proof. Doesn't cause breakouts. Would recommend for various skin types."
187,l'orÃ©al,age perfect creamy powder foundation,pimprod2021675,2569747," * Very light, silky powder texture. The ""creamy"" title is very deceiving though. It's powder. And quite drying immediately on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this for aging skin whatsoever. Great product for on the go touch ups on oily skin. * I don't care for the sponge applicator because it really doesn't go on right, but I found that using a brush to apply is so much better and it goes on more evenly.  You can add more where needed without it looking blotchy.  I love it! Used the color Sienna * Goes smooth and cover some imperfections, but looks natural. Leaves your skin soft and beautiful. * Lightest shade, Ivory.  You MUST prep the skin with moisturizer, sunscreen and either CT Hollywood Flawless Filter or the Maybeline knockoff or a dewy primer or sunscreen.  Buff in with a brush after applying concealer where needed.  Use powder bronzer, blush and highlight and a setting spray.  It looked amazing on my 48 year old dry skin and lasted all day.  Not powdery, didn't settle in lines, let's your skin peek through (is light coverage).   I really love it. * I thought since it's called age perfect it would be a moisturizing creamy powder. Nope. It's super drying and I have combination oily skin not even dry. Feels horrible right on application You can feel the makeup. Didn't blur anything. I had to take it off within 10 mins of application. Don't buy this stuff. * I wanted to try a cream to powder foundation to try to cover some dark spots. 
This covered what I wanted. It does look a little dry after application but I'm oily so it looks more natural after a few hours. * I love the age rewind concealer and seen this after looking for a good powder foundation. it is a really creamy, finely milled powder. I don't think it's really pigmented but you get enough coverage to even everything out and in my opinion it really does blur. I use a flat top Kabuki brush to buff it in, slowly building up layers. I take product and tap it in where I need more coverage with a concealer brush. I find I get the most coverage this way. it's like your skin but better. gives you a nice natural finish and doesn't look cakey if you slowly buff and build. will be trying this as a setting powder for liquid since it blurs. it also doesn't make me breakout!"
188,hynt beauty,encore pressed powder foundation,pimprod2014352,2564466," * I was so excited to try this powder because of all of the positive reviews. Unfortunately, This product didn't work for my dry skin. And for the price I doesn't have great coverage. I don't see this product any different from any other pressed powder. Also, this powder has sparkles in it I guess to conceal how drying and powdery it makes the skin.. * I love this powder, my skin is dry but this powder always feels comfortable on, never adds any texture as other powders have for me in the past, def one of my fav powders * I LOVE this pressed powder! It takes away the look of shine and makes my skin look refined and even toned. I bought Ivory and it is the ideal shade for my skin tone, medium fair with pink undertones. It works well worn over concealer and foundation, or on its own. And, better still, it looks invisible and feels like nothing on skin! The mirrored compact is the perfect size for taking on the go and it even comes with an applicator sponge on a clear, hinged divider inside. Hynt thought of everything with this pressed powder! I will definitely buy again:) * I've always been reluctant to wear powder - most of the time I end up looking cake-y. This finishing powder is a game changer - so easy to apply and bonus, the packaging is so adorable! But more importantly my skin looks so velvety and super plump, definitely will be coming back for more when I'm through with this! * Love using this powder in-between zoom meetings to touch up my skin. Just gives me a more even/finished and natural look * One of my favorite products from Hynt * I used this foundation with the foam puff it came packaged with. Do not use with a brush, the powder is finely milled and will fall off your brush! I wore it over serum and moisturizer. My face got a little shiny throughout the day but that is common for me, as I have combination skin. I like that the coverage is buildable, I was able to apply two layers and achieved the coverage I was looking for. Best of all, the ingredients are natural and truly clean! No SLS, no parabens, no Lauryl Lysine, no Bismuth oxychloride! So happy Ulta is carrying this brand!"
189,hourglass,vanish seamless finish liquid foundation,pimprod2020422,2575785," * For a pro makeup artist, ( yes, you need to be a pro to know how to work with it) this is so far one of the best foundations that I have ever worked with. I recommend performing a gentle face exfolation before bed time and removing any peach fuzz for any makeup aplication, not just this foundation. It makes a huge difference in aplication and appearance of the final look/finish.
It works best with the Vanish smoothing primer. (To smooth down the pores that every human being has) It is runny but extreamly pigmented. Do not use too much or it will look cakey.Best apply with a dense buffer brush (Morphe 444 is my favorite) and then press it in with a beauty blender. I use the professional Kryolan setting spray first, and then set it with a good powder.( Jeffree Star, Fenty or Kryolan powder) It holds for 14h even in humid Florida. Best foundation for events. It's best for normal/ combination skin. I wish they had more shades.
Unfortunately it just has been discontinued, tho the company has gave me insites that they are working on perfecting the formula and making a new foundation for combination/oily skin (they currently carry luminous foundations for normal/dry skin) * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * This product is so thin & runny! Like water consistency. I pumped one pump on my hand & it literally dripped off me. I shook the bottle so many times & it still remained runny. I gave it a try on my face because I wanted to give the foundation a chance but the product just settled right into any crevice it could. I could literally see wrinkles/lines I didn't even know I had. * I got this during a sale and was so excited to try my first Hourglass product. I followed the instructions and reviews and only used a very little amount. It brings out my pores horribly, dries down very weird and makes my skin dry, and even though it feels light on my skin my skin feels a tiny bit sticky, not something I usually experience with prestige brand foundations. This is a miss for me. * This foundation is very reminiscent of Marc Jacob's 'Remarcable' . Full coverage and matte with a pore filling matte primer underneath . The bad reviews are really just people who don't know how to apply makeup . * Words do not explain how buttery this foundation is I have dry to normal skin and it blends it two to three glides. Will never use another foundation"
190,smashbox,studio skin 24 hour full coverage waterproof foundation,pimprod2009758,2552423," * Luckily I night this on a good sale a ways back but it is just not it. I have combo oily skin and so far regardless of the primer or moisturizer this just doesn't look good and will break down. I've been using juvias place which I like ten times better and I don't have to try to make it work. This foundation also oxidizes orange..so not just a shade but it'll turn more orange as well. I'm gonna try to find something to mjx it with but I won't be purchasing again and wouldn't recommend it. * I have oily combo skin, and this foundation did not stand the test of time. It felt very heavy, and transferred with the slightest touch (with setting powder). Only a few hours in, and it was breaking apart on my face, highlighting even the slightest texture. My pores were literally drinking this product up. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a foundation, and could not wait to take it off. * I have combo skin, I use the Bobby brown moisturizer primer underneath and only use a tiny bit with a brush. Looks flawless!! Do not use to much product otherwise it will look cakey, if you need extra coverage apply only to specific area with smaller brush. * 32f (no active breakout/indented scars only on cheeks/combination skin)This foundation has the worst formula I have ever used on my skin. I tried two different primers underneath and tried it on it's own and it just refused to settle or smooth out. It creases badly and makes skin look dry and caked with very minimal use of the product that looked worse and worse if you tried to use even a tiny bit more. Powders and setting spray do nothing to help. I tried beauty blenders and brushes and neither made it better. I ended up going back to a trusty Revlon foundation that was way cheaper and a much better formula. Do not waste your money if you do not have perfect smooth skin. * I have sensitive skin with large amounts of rosacea and occasional eczema. This product covers my redness very well, and can many my dry areas seemingly disappear. Smashbox was also a line that came up multiple times during my search for products best for sensitive skin. * Maybe this just doesn't work with some skin types. I've given this several goes with different amounts of product and application techniques and it always manages to cake up and accentuate every pore after it's settled. I decided to give this one more go, applying after a glowy moisturizer that managed to save some of my other cakey products and it still had the same issues after setting for about 20 minutes. * It has perfect coverage,  a very little goes a long way.  Love the Matt finish I got.  Like  all foundations,  you have to prepare your skin before you applying anything to it.  Use a brush to apply.  I patted it on."
