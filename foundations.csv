1,urban decay,face bond self-setting waterproof foundation,pimprod2044818,2623593," * Didn't care for this employee pushed me to buy it but ended up returning it * Okay, so I picked this up during 21 Days of Beauty. I was worried about the negative reviews, but found that this is indeed sweat and humidity-proof. It's not 100% transfer-proof, but it lasted through a FULL DAY of rain and humidity in South Florida summer. Some key things to note are that it's best to swatch in person or pick a shade lighter than what you'd normally go for, as this does run warm and dark. This product DOES NOT play well with other creams or liquids, so it's best to keep face prep minimal and let it dry for at least 10 minutes before applying this foundation. If you're dry and need lots of skin prep, I'd say wait at least 20 minutes before using this, or IT WILL PILL. The same goes for liquid/gel brow products. Do your brows first and let them dry completely. Apply the foundation in thin layers and blend quickly with a brush to avoid patchiness. For blush/bronzer/highlight, stick to powders, and you should be good. * I really wanted to love this foundation…went to the store multiple times to swatch it - under store light and by a window.  And it all looks so good and well color matched.  So I was so happy this was one of the items on 21 days of beauty.  But it was a bit of a let down on the first day of use as the foundation was patchy and found every pore and lines on my face.  I tried all kinds various face prep : primer/no primer, well moisturized and less moisturized , sunblock and no no sunblock.  The only one that looked the best was no sunblock.  So this is a no go for me if I can't wear sunblock.  The color is a perfect match so I'm bummed. I think it'll work for others but my sunblock didnt like.
I want to return it but I've used it for almost a week now and I feel kinda bad… * It was to oily for my skin * Light but great coverage, plus its really hard to find a skin match and this one does the trick :) * I've been using it for maybe 6 months now, i got a new bottle like 3 months ago. I liked it at first, it reminded me of a lightweight Chanel foundation i liked. But its started to feel…heavy? Like it sits on top of my skin in a weird way, clings to any dryness, and comes out super patchy. It dries really fast so it is really hard to blend and throughout the day it just melts away now. It used to last all day. And the actual foundation in the bottle has started thickening. Its almost like it goes bad really fast. * I honestly really enjoy this Foundation I use it with either the next marshmallow primer or Maybelline poreless jelly primer it lasts all day it is super blurring on my skin I don't do much skin prep prior either for information my skin is normal leaning oily I like that you can have a custom coverage a brush will definitely give you minimum coverage a sponge is medium and your fingers will be full if you don't like using your fingers you can always build it with a sponge as well"

3,dior,dior forever fluid skin glow foundation,pimprod2036824,2605019," * I have rosacea and little bumps on my cheeks due to my rosacea. I pump 3 full pumps on the back of my hand, apply it to my face with a foundation brush, and I'm done. The finish is absolutely gorgeous, especially when pairing it with Huda Beauty's Cherry loose setting powder under my eyes, my nose, above my lip, and my chin. It's necessary for me to find a good foundation and a good powder because I live in Phoenix, AZ. As soon as I step outside, the heat beats down on me. The SPF in this foundation is obviously not enough, so first I moisturize with Pond's, put a 60+ SPF sunscreen cream on, Power Grip primer, then my foundation. My foundation has never looked so good! I don't care what anyone else says, but I love the scent of the foundation. I feel so pretty and luxe when applying it and smelling it. I'm on my second bottle and I will definitely be purchasing it again as it is my new regular foundation. I only hope that maybe Dior considers adding more SPF to it, but not if it changes the current formula. * My favorite foundation I mix it with elf halo glow. It's the best foundation I've used * This has so far been the best foundation I have found for my mature skin. I am so far happy with it. I am a week in and still happy!! * The finish was very greasy and blotchy. I tried with several different applicators and primers. I have textured, dry skin. Would probably look great as light coverage on clear skin! * This is my go to foundation. Absolutely love the color match and the sustainability of the product. * I love this foundation but the smell is outrageous! I cannot take it. I smelled it for a couple of hours. I never write reviews . * It feels great, and initially goes on great. I always use the Porefessional primer w/ any foundation.. then a sheer setting powder. Well my normal 2 foundations look great all day, pores look normal. The Dior lasted a couple hours before creeping all in my pores- making them stand out too much. Don't recommend if u have somewhat large pores.. mine r like medium craters w/ no makeup- lol"

5,lancÃ´me,teint idole ultra wear 24h full coverage foundation,pimprod2039028,2608119," * Since my last foundation was discontinued , I was on a very expensive journey to find a foundation that was sweat proof and transfer resistant but also long lasting. This has been great so far and even wore it in 95+ degree weather with no smudge. * The shade is a perfect match. I also love the way it applies though I would have preferred something more thinner and more hydrating. * Product has great coverage. It works better for me when I use a moisturizer and before the moisturizer dries when applying. * The lightest shade 085 was the perfect foundation for me for years. It's hard to find such a light shade. However now their lightest shade is way too dark for me. It's very sad they got rid of it * It does not matter how much foundation I have in my collection, but I always have to have this foundation. One thing I learned about this foundation you can wear as like tinted moisturizer you can do full coverage. You can do light coverage and it gives you the coverage that you need my favorite love it. * Emptied my first bottle and missed it. I didn't realize the formula had changed until I was trying to find my old shade. This one did not wear well and crept into lines and wrinkles. Wore off in areas by the end of the work day. I do admit that it went on smoothly and easily, it just didn't last. Not for my mature skin with the new formula. * I have used Lancome foundation for over 20 years.  My boss wore it while giving birth and looked great after the baby was born.  I decided then I was switching to Lancome and have used it ever since.  It is flawless. Great coverage and so many shades to choose from. Stays on all day. I won't use anything else."

8,nars,light reflecting advanced skincare foundation,pimprod2030141,2591117," * I wanted so much to love this foundation and make it work, but it just didn't for me which is sad because it did help my skin.  It oxidized on me, settled into every line, wrinkle, and pore, and looked like a shiny mask. The amount of money I've spent on this foundation and trying various things to make it work is obnoxious so I have to replace it. * Switched to NARS after using Estee and I love how dewy (but not too dewy) and natural this looks on my skin. Feels natural without feeling heavy. * This foundation is absolutely gorgeous. It goes on beautifully and stays throughout the day. It is definitely a dewy finish it that is what you are looking for. Unfortunately i could not get past the smell. I am not super sensitive when it comes to smells, but this straight up smells like im putting bug spray or something on my face. Its not just a light smell either its very strong and pungent. * I do get hormonal breakouts at times (I'm 53), but not THAT bad, I really think this made my skin break out. And the match quiz did not help me, Valarius is too orange for me. Pretty disappointing and a waste of quite a few dollars. * I've spent over 25 years wearing EsteeLauder, converted to Revlon to break up costs and to get a tad more moisture as I age.  EL I'm Cashew color.  I was matched up Barcelona (which was too light for me) or Valencia (which was too orange for me). Revlon I have to buy 2 colors to mix.  Nars, well I love their blushes.  Their foundation seemed to be loved by many,  so I thought I'd try out of boredom.... first off, when I say it's runny,  I mean,  you literally need a drop. its almost like I dumped an entire bottle of serum into my foundation.  Yes,  that's how runny it is,  even when rubbing into my face.  I looked like a wet wax face.  It felt uncomfortable like I wanted to itch it off. Even with a setting powder it was wet.  Other makeup did NOT blend well at all either. Side note,  I have PCOS, so I need full coverage.  This is probably the furthest from medium/full/build able coverage.  So it's a huge no for me.  Not only that,  during the day I kept getting a wiff of something rancid on my face.  I have sensitive skin. Made where I shave,  turn red and seap through.  I'll stick with what I use.  Love Nars, but not the foundation.  Probably perfect for people who want a BB cream lol * I wore this foundation for a full day to do a wear test and see how the product looked from running around all day... I'll give it a 7/10.

Shade match (Oslo) was perfect!... for a hour. Got in the car, flicked open the mirror, and BAM! Orange! Nothing else wrong with the product though. 

I'll compliment the formula. I have combination skin and a lot of products get patchy around my nose and the apples of my cheeks. This foundation didnt, however, I did have to apply multiple layers for full coverage. Definitely buildable!

If the product didnt oxidize so much it would've been 10/10, 5 stars, but I did end up returning the foundation. * I did not like this.  Texture was like an extra thin serum and I found it hard to work with.   Also settled into wrinkles."
9,mac,studio fix fluid spf15 24hr matte foundation + oil control,pimprod2044825,2622206," * Great product * Mac is a great product. I use the powder and love it. However this item wasn't the best for me. It might be my skin but it made my face look super dry and it caked it was thick and all around no good I was really disappointed! * It's terrible now since there was a change in the formula. It's not like it used to be at all. I had to switch brands. * Complete formula change and completely disappointed….it doesn't stay on, creases and settles into lines and pores. I tried it with several preps and setting sprays spending extra time and money to compensate for what a bad foundation it is now.  At the end, it's just a very expensive, terrible performing, high maintenance messy product that is absolutely not worth it. I won't purchase this again, the bottle I did purchase was returned. * I used to be a NW15, which matched my skin tone perfectly. Now, NW15 is nowhere near my skin tone. The Ulta associate told me that MAC updated their packaging, along with the product. Be aware that you might need a shade match when purchasing. * It left me feeling cakey didn't blend in with my coverups. * Highly disappointed with this new formula. It has a pump now, which I thought might be a good thing, but it's not. There's no cap on the pump so foundation gets everywhere and creates a mess! The foundation itself….huge fail! It's completely different to the original and not in a good way. It doesn't stay on, it creates a greasy, splotchy, chalky finish that does not look good. I've had drugstore foundations that look better than this. I will not be buying this foundation anymore, the bottle I purchased was returned."

It looks and feels great. * I could not pass this foundation up when I saw it on sale at Ulta. It goes on smooth with whatever you use. My first time wearing was at a baby shower and it held up perfectly. My face was not greasy looking after hours of wear with no touch ups. I'm so glad I bought this. * I haven't used this foundation in years, but I picked up a bottle during the 21 Days of Beauty sale. I'm happy to report that it was even better than I remembered, and wore beautifully in this week's heat wave. I wish I'd picked up an extra bottle during the sale! * I love this product best foundation ever 😍 * I have oily skin type and in need of a long wear foundation that will last through south Florida heat and humidity. This was it for me I'll for ever be purchasing this foundation, it stays on 10hrs plus and feels so much lighter then others Ive tried. It can be medium or full coverage also which I love! * I like full cobertura * **not paid for this review***
Love this foundation! Doesn't transfer, concealer is not really needed due to the strong coverage quality. I highly recommend this for my brown girls due to the large shade collection and amazing quality"

It goes on light, stays on all day and has a nice coverage that does not look like I have anything on.  I have had several compliments since I started using it.
Good pick and perfect sunscreen as well. * This is my new foundation. * I'm 58 years old and I have been using this specific product for several years now and I LOVE it. It is more for the light make up users but you still get that youthful glow look. It does not cake. * People have said my skin looks brighter and the feel is amazing highly recommend * I was not pleased with my results. I bought the fair light shade.  At first application, it appeared fine. Soon after, I noticed how the longer I left the product on my face the oranger the glow became.  I washed it off within 2 hours. I never even made it outside into the sun! New product bought at Ulta store. Not expired. Nope...never...ever...again. Shame. It had promising ingredients like 2% Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, and green tea extract, too. * The nude glow did not work for me. I need more coverage than this provides and will need to return.
Thx. Barb"

It is a matte formula, but yet leaves your skin looking fresh and not dry . Very easy application with a brush which is what I used to apply my makeup. * I hav been using It foundation for over 10 years and I love how it looks so natural.  I get compliments on my skin.  Very good coverage of darker spots and blemishes. * I've bought other IT foundations and been very happy with them. I thought I would try a matte. First try I hated it. I felt like I was wearing stage makeup. Had a hard time blending and I ended up wiping it off. Returned the next day. * I've been using this product for about 3 yrs & will continue to purchase it. It's the best! * This had ok coverage but no mater my skin prep this would still settle in all my pores and fine lines. I had to return. * I did like it at first when I tried it at ulta but after a few uses I noticed that it just dried to fast on my face and didn't blend well so it looked blotchy and dry in some areas . I use a lot of it products and foundations but this one just didn't work for me * Great foundation that covers pretty much everything and you don't have to use a lot!! Even better is that it has SPF!!! What more can you ask for???"

20,fenty beauty by rihanna,eaze drop blurring skin tint,pimprod2031372,2592608," * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I really like the Fenty Eaze Drop Skin Tint! It's lightweight, smooths out my skin, and looks very natural. Perfect for everyday wear. Just note it's light to medium coverage, so you may still need concealer for spots. Unfortunately my son lost my bottle I can't take picture but the size is the perfect one for travel. * I tried these skin blurring tint drops and I didn't know what to expect but the coverage on these is phenomenal. They look and cover like a concealer but wear even lighter. I like the consistency and their online help is great because I got the perfect skin match on my first try. It wears really well and stays the whole day, I didn't have any problems with sweating it off or any annoying transfer. The best part of these is just how smooth my pores looked. My skin texture was awesome and so smooth. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] 
This is a skin-like tint with lighter coverage and a soft blurry finish. I like the wide shade range you can choose from as well 
It can look a little cakey and highlight creases so make sure to prep your skin beforehand especially if you have dry skin
I use this when I want some lighter everyday coverage and think it looks natural with proper skin prep * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion. I love this foundation! It's light weight and look natural on me. The price is affordable. I would recommend this product to my family and friends. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This foundation had great coverage and applied really evenly. I love that there's such a wide shade range. It was slightly too deep for me but I did like how it applied with a sponge. Packaging is cute too and scent was not overpowering. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I got this as a free sample but I've already bought it a few times before because it's one of my favorite skin tints. The shade match (11)is perfect for my skin and it blends in so easily. It gives me a smooth blurred look while still feeling really lightweight and natural. It's become one of those products I keep going back to because it always works for me. * I couldn't be more pleased with this product! It left my skin feeling moisturized, and tan! It feels silky on the skin and rub on great!"

If you have dry skin the foundation does feel nice without it being too heavy. * Man I wanted to love this foundation, but before I even put it on my face I hated it. It was sooooooooo runny. I mean soooo runny. Then put it on my face and it was horrible. I had to return it. I do love the Morphe eye shadows though. Very pigmented. * I loved how this foundation looked for the first month of wearing it but after a while it started to break me out badly, don't recommend if you have acnd prone skin!!! * This foundation is amazing! If you get your proper shade it seriously looks like nothing is there! I 100% recommend! Very light weight aswell! * Best foundation I've tried at this price point. Wears great, full coverage without settling into lines. I put my makeup on around 6:30 am and it still looks amazing g when I'm done at four. Definitely on my list of repeat buys. * My daughter and I have used the filter effect foundation and it's now discontinued,we have this a shot while I don't love this lightform I don't completely dislike it but I'm not sure if it's the formula or the dispensing pump but it makes a huge mess * I am almost 45 years old, and this has been the best foundation I have found!  It is hydrating, has flawless coverage, smooth snd silky to put on. I thought i would have to useca different foundation for the summer, but it still gives me the perfect amount of hydration for the summer."

Will return. * The product is much lighter in color than expected. The product is very drying to the skin. * Very nice consistency with good coverage. * I find this make up to be extremely dry and cakey. And to make batteries worse I put a tiny bit on my eyelid and my eyes were burning and stinking for hours so I guess I'm allergic to it. * I've been using Estee Lauder for a while now, and i wanted to experiment with something different.  I'm SO glad Ulta had this on their 21 days of beauty sale. I love it!  A little goes a LONG way.  I used 2 pumps on my hand, and that was not necessary at all.  1 pump would suffice.

I have acne prone skin and redness so i struggle finding something like a skin tint, but also has a good coverage until now. I feel like every skin tint i try is so thin, its honestly pointless but this one is fantastic. You can make it light and thin but can also build it up. I even use this on a full beat look and its fantastic. Seriously do not have one bad thing to say on it. * I've been using this product for over 2 years, and I LOVE IT! * i wasnt sure what shade i was so i used the shade finder. that was such a big mistake, it was way too warm toned and almost orange * This may be a con for aome since its considered a skin tint, but i absolitely love the coverage on this! Ita not thin on application like a skin tint usually is, but instead has really good coverage, without feeling cakey or thick- i got two shades so i have a winter color and summer color and i love them all. I go back ans forth between this and a standard foundation and always go right back to using this no mather the circumstances because it gives me whatever type of coverage i want. I have acne prone skin & this still covers acne with no issues for me! Probably my favorite yet! * Im so pleasantly surprised by this product. Ive been using for a few months now. I have to say it is as good and in some cases better than my high end foundations. I find myself reaching for it over the others regularly. It goes on light snd yet covers in a natural gliwy finish. It diesnt settle into my fine lines. Stays beautiful all day. I am 56 and have dry skin. I'm in love! * This is great for my 58 year old skin. It covers but looks so natural."
28,beautycounter,skin twin featherweight foundation,pimprod2038184,2606483," * I truely like the way the foundation glides on and covers. * I had high hopes for this foundation, considering all the positive reviews, but I found it to be subpar. The smell was absolutely terrible, I found the coverage to be uneven, and after an hour or so of wear, I looked in the mirror and it really exaggerated my fine lines and pores. I for sure would not recommend this foundation to anybody over the age of 35. * This is a no for me. It smells terrible and does not work on my skin. Exaggerates dry spots, separates in oily areas, and looks cakey with any amount of product. I've tried applying with fingers, brushes, and sponges. I'm really disappointed I spent so much on it. Drugstore foundations are much better quality than this one! * This is a difficult foundation to work with, the coverage never looks even to me and it's not buildable. up close, I can see it pills on my skin if I pass the sponge over it more than a couple of times. cream products don't layer over it well - it's hard to blend cream blush, bronzer and highlighter on top and it transfers and moves all over the face. It doesn't really set down, even with powder. I have dry skin and never have issues with uneven coverage or getting a foundation to set down, with or without setting powder. I'm just not a fan, I have wet n wild, Catrice, urban decay and Pat McGrath foundations that all perform better across the cost spectrum. * This a wonderful foundation. It gives perfect coverage, making my skin look dewy and fresh.   The best part is that it is a clean product, without the bad stuff.I love this brand. * Not enough coverage for my aging skin! * Unsure. It's not like it's a bad product. I feel it's good quality. I think maybe for a lighter foundation could be a good find. I feel for the price, what my expectations were; not a good buy necessarily. Fell a bit flat for me. I've also only used a couple (2-3) times. Maybe it grows. My skin feels nice.
I don't feel excited afterwords-if that makes sense? Sometimes I put on foundation and I'm like ""OO-Hello there!"" I put this on and feel like…ehh. Best way I can put it. I did have a more positive prospective when adding a glow enhancer. It's ok."

It is perfect for a natural look. * Love the cc+ plus brand all together! Use all their products for my face & always get compliments. Nice recommendation from the store associate & overall good experience! Will buy again!! * I don't understand why all the negative reviews. first this powder is amazing, it's lightweight but you can apply more for more coverage. I FINALLY FOUND A POWDER THAT COVERS ALL THE REDNESS ON MY CHEEKS! no joke. it doesn't cause my face to look oily, no blotting sheets necessary. it lasts all day. another thing is I appreciate the small pad that comes with the powder just in case you want to reapply in the middle of the day, but the good news is I can leave my powder at home, because it lasts throughout my day. people compliment me & wonder what I am using. I buy another powder and always go back to this one. it doesn't sink into your pores and make them look huge or settle in the creases of your face, it just looks natural not a cakey powder. & no more redness. I do use the liquid foundation on some days and I love it too! can't go wrong with this powder. * I'm not super oily by any means, but this product acts like I'm an oil slick. 
I normally use the lancome pressed powder and it looks dry until alil oil mixes, then it doesn't look like makeup at all.  this powder once you apply it looks great, but after 30 minutes it's slipping and sliding around my face. any little touch to the face and it'll come right off. and don't get me started on the shade range.
so if you have super dry skin, doesn't make any oil at all, you'll be fine. everyone else find a different option. * Light feeling powder, not heavy at all * First, why is this powder packaged with an application pad (and big fat case to store it) while the instructions say to use a brush?! And even with a super light brush application, the powder sits on the skin, making it look fake and amplifying every. single. pore. I didn't think I had huge pores until I tried this to mattify my nose, only to have it make my pores look like craters covering  the surface of the moon. Yuck! I've used It Cosmetics moisturizers, foundation, concealer, and mascara for years but now I don't feel like I can trust this brand to make products that work or were designed with the customer in mind. * I like it. It doesn't break me out or bother my sensitive skin, plus the color match is pretty good. It is heavier than other powder products (ie Clinique) so it's not the one I reach for on a regular basis."

I will be buying this again for sure! * This foundation to so good. I'd put it one par with Estee Lauder Double Wear. Similar but better. Looks like skin. Super light weight and give full coverage. Can't imagine what other didnt like about it. * The best foundation I've used ever. It has a skin like look and blends perfectly. You can also build on top of it really nicely. I use it for stage make up so I put a lot of layers on top and it works very nicely. * I was so let down by this foundation. I thought it would be a good fit for me since its a full coverage foundation that is supposed to feel like a serum. But it ended up looking cakey almost immediately, and 30 mins later it began to separate badly in my nose. It just looked horrible. I've tried changing up my primer, powder, etc and it's still the same. I really wanted to love it since it is full coverage, but at what cost? I cant wear it at all because I work high-end retail sales, and how I present myself at work is important. Super disappointing. I've never had this issue with a foundation before. * I keep trying other foundations but come back to this one because it has serum so not drying for mature skin is full coverage and long wearing! * Very full coverage anx decent lasting power but the foundation oxidizes like crazy, smh eventually with time making the foundation color a lot darker than when you first apply it."

I am light/medium complexion and I do think that I could've went a shade or 2 darker. It has beautiful coverage and does last all day. * Always great customer service and very helpful employees. * I bought this in two shades. Color match is terrible.  Wear is terrible.  Threw both bottles away. * I love this foundation it's full coverage and I use it everyday * I was a little skeptical to try this as I have very sensitive and acne/fungal acne prone skin but this so far has been amazing on my skin!

I have oily skin and it doesn't breakdown the way my other urban decay foundation did. 9/10 * Would recommend  this foundation has so much full coverage and it lasted all day

It in fact made them appear worse.  Too dry also.  Will be returning. * Not enough coverage. * Bare Minerals matte finish foundation goes in easy , covers beautifully but not heavy at all. I have mature skin but in no way does it cake up or look heavy * It feels really light on my skin. Love the tone and great product. * I used to love this foundation and then they changed the formula.  Now is thick and cakey.  I've been using it for years and now I have to find another foundation that won't break me out. * This has got to be the WORST foundation. I have dry skin and was looking for a 24 hour foundation that didn't break me out. This foundation separates in the first hours of wear. I regret ever buying this. * I miss the old formula just as so many others have stated in the comments. The old formula was buildable coverage and so breathable and smooth on the skin. This formula is thick and heavy, not buildable coverage (too full coverage imo), very drying on the skin, and emphasizes pores and texture. I really hope bareMinerals sees the feedback and stops making so many changes to their core skus. This foundation was my favorite but I'll be moving on from it sadly."
35,polite society,more than a pretty face skin-caring foundation,pimprod2040619,2615174," * This is my favorite foundation to wear. I don't normally write Ulta reviews but I have spent so much money on different foundations and I've finally found one that works for me. I'm 41 so I have aging concerns and I have combination skin. This doesn't make me break out, it doesn't crumble or crack, or settle into face lines. I don't even have to wear primer with it. I bought it on a whim because it was on sale for cheap, just to give it a try and I can't believe that i got so lucky. * Spreads smoothly and looks very natural. Love it * After seeing several people review this, I decided to buy it when it was on sale... thankfully. This foundation appears to blend, but any amount of moisture makes it bead up again. Attempting to use powder to set just made it worse. I will not repurchase. * I am a 60 year old woman and have tried a lot of foundations, but this is hands down the best one. It doesn't settle in my lines and goes on my face smoothly. It has a very natural finish and it lasts all day with the setting powder by Polite society and a setting spray. I wont use anything else now. Perfection. I also love that the foundation for very fair skin has cool pink undertones. It is my perfect shade and so many foundations dont offer this. Thank you Polite Society! I sont ever want to be without this! * Literally the best foundation i have tried. I have oily skin plus i live in the south so it doesn't take a lot for makeup to slide off me but this one will stay with minimal skin prep. Not to metion it actually matches and as a pale pinky toned girl who can't tan it is truly a godsend. It doesnt cake it looks beautiful and i am obsessed with it. * In the Florida heat and humidity this foundation does not move or look greasy. Lasted all day and looks beautiful and natural on the skin.
L O V E! * I get complimented on this everytime i wear it. My skins sensite and combo. It doesnt seperate or cause oilness."

38,clinique,even better clinical serum foundation broad spectrum spf 25,pimprod2021174,2574625," * I'm wondering if maybe the shades are mislabeled as yellow tint should not be in cool shades.  Cool is for pink undertones for a reason.  I first used the shade finder to match the Clinique foundation to another brand that suits my skin tone.  The shade finder was way off!.  It matched me to a shade that I automatically knew would be too dark for my fair complexion so I chose one that was a little lighter in color (CN10).  When I received it, it was also too dark and was yellow but should have had a pink color to it.  I took it back to the store hoping they would swap it for a lighter shade.  The only two options left was CN08 or CN02, according to the website, both of these are cool shades.  With help from an Ulta employee, I chose the CN02.  I took it home, put it on this morning at it is YELLOW!  I can't believe this!  That is the reason that I am giving this foundation a 3 star is because of the yellow tint in the cool shades.  The makeup itself I do like because it lasts all day and helps to control my oil. * Love, love, love this foundation! It goes on so smooth, feels lightweight, and never looks heavy. I love that it has serum skincare benefits built in and SPF 25 for protection. It lasts all day, keeps my skin looking fresh, and gives a beautiful natural finish. Best foundation I've ever used! * I absolutely love the product.  Light weight but yet covers nicely.    I do have to say I hate the shape of the bottle as it is not very travel friendly being tear shaped.   Doesn't fit in cosmetic bags that great. * I thought this foundation would be better for aging skin but when applying it, it seeps into every crevice and pore. It was not flattering. I decided to give this away to someone else after trying it the one time. * She loves it and makes her look younger. * I'm so very disappointed with Clinique. I've been using their products for nearly 30 years. Their current selection of foundations is the worst ever. They discontinued Stay Matte, my favorite. I'll be returning this ""Even Better"" formula, it's absolutely the worst! * This foundation is terrible. Does not last all day, separates, shows pores, highlights any wrinkles or texture. Would not recommend, eapecially at the price point."

The Ulta associate really helped me find the best color match, as there are many shades available for this foundation. * I absolutely love this powder. I struggle with getting the right coverage for my skin type (sensitive, rosacea) with liquid foundation. I prefer a more natural look and this made me look airbrushed as well! * I bought this powder foundation after reading reviews and wish I had bought it sooner! Good coverage and doesn't settle into my pores or wrinkles like other products I've tried. Doesn't oxidize or turn orangey after a few hours of wear and last well throughout the day. This is my new go to for day to day use! * Very impressed with Natasha D makeup. Everything that I have bought I have ended up keeping from concealer, eyeshadow, lipstick and now this powder foundation. I actually use it as a finishing powder and touch ups. My routine includes starting with the IT Cosmetics CC cream and top off with this powder- you can keep layering and your skin will look beautiful!! I top off with bronzer or blush if I feel like it. The best thing is that the shades provide a natural flesh like color. * Powder foundation is just not good for nature skin .... goes in every line under my eyes * Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this powder foundation! It's so good! I was really nervous to spend this much money on it, but I was already using another expensive brand, but they were constantly out of stock with my shade for months at a time. I saw good reviews for Natasha Denonas, so I thought I'd give it a shot! Blown away! It's so much better than I was using!! It didn't make me break out at all either. I have very sensitive skin. It's not drying at all. It's like a creamy powder. It literally still looks good 8hrs after working! The only downfall is the price and it does smell a little weird. Not like perfume or anything. Just not the greatest smell. But you can't smell it once it's on, just as you're putting it on. It's also cool they have refills so you don't have to pay the 55 everytime. Overall, highly recommend! * The best powder I have ever found!"

I use the shade 5-6 Medium Tan and it works well in the summer (have to use one shade lighter in the winter). Since it's a skin tint, the staying power by itself is not amazing but if I set it with powder and spray my face with setting spray, it lasts all day without touch ups. * Love this formula and the shade match. Only issue is the awful packaging, very messy with the dropper. Love it so much I'll buy my own pump. * This gives good coverage, lightweight and my skin looks fantastic. It's so natural and I struggled finding something that didn't make me look too oily.  However my skin still looks hydrated.  The only downfall is the dropper -  that doesn't seem to be the best way to apply.  I just put some on a foundation brush and don't use the dropper. * I've never found a truer match than the light-medium shade of this tint. This product can be built up to medium coverage if needed. The only issue is the dropper. Overtime, it builds product around the itself resulting in messy application. I just use a brush to apply instead to avoid over using product. * I have worn L'Oreal foundations for years and loved them.  But as I age, I cannot seem to find a formula that works for my skin.  The good:  a broad choice of colors.  The price point is not bad for the amount of product you get.  The bad:  this formula is more watery than most of their foundations, and it settled into fine lines and into pores.  The finish became splotchy after several hours.  The applicator dropper is awful to use.  Very messy.   I returned it. * Love this for days I don't want to wear a full face/more coverage. Lightly evens out skin tone and is super hydrating and glowy. Like a super light cc cream. * Wanted to like this due to the HA but it just makes your face orange and oily...."

The other is double wear. I am light medium olive and use either 5.5N or 6N depending upon the time of year.  My skin is on the drier side skin but I have no issues . I do however hydrate properly. Toner or Serum, moisturizer and then the glow serum. Foundation, setting powder and setting spray, It stays well. * Checks all the boxes: 
Skin type: oily
Coverage needs: full
Longwearing: excelent 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED * I like it. My shade sent was a little too light so I mixed it with a darker color. It is creamy and provides good coverage. * Light/med shade with neutral undertone, mature skin. sadly it's separated a lot throughout the day. I'm not sure if I was using the wrong primer or my sunblock was too sheer, but I really struggled with this foundation * Unfortunately, this was one of the foundations i wanted to purchase for a long time. I finally did when it went on sale. Maybe it's my skin. But this is total failure for me. The color changes and becomes more drier. * Doesn't settle in creases moisturizing and breathable all at once and truly stars all day!"
43,it cosmetics,your skin but better foundation + skincare,pimprod2017112,2568683," * I'm so glad I try new things because this foundation is phenomenal. I am 60 years old and it gives me enough coverage. Also gives me a nice glow. My face looks refreshed and so much younger anyway best foundation I've tried in a long time. We'll definitely be buying again. * First  foundation that actually matched my skin, literally covers everything ans stays on, i wanted to love it but on my first try I noticed dry brown patches after I cleaned my face and  was very dry, not for me 😞 * I love this foundation, it is very lightweight so I had to use a heavy moisturizer and thick primer. It worked well with both NYX and Provedence drugstore primers.

Also my deep skin discoloration are covered with a tiny amount. I use liquid bronzer and blush with it and it pairs well with Pacifica and Maybelline liquid products. Once this foundation dries on your skin, it will break up if you add liquid or oil makeup on top- but as long as I do it all at one it sets the makeup and last for my work day. 

FYI I set my face with pixi skin veil and it wasn't too drying on my dry skin. They recommended I get a shade lighter foundation to cover and it gave me full coverage. The only con is my local Ulta doesn't sell it so I have to buy online. * this is so watery I don't even know how you're supposed to apply it. I wore it for one day and within a few hours started developing a severe rash on my skin that has lasted for several days. would not recommend. * I'm obsessed with this foundation! You don't feel like you are wearing anything! It's life changing! * This is actually a first… I've never experienced a foundation that manages to be extremely watery, yet also cakey at the same time. Unsure what kind of mystery this is, because it's certainly not a good one. Color was also extremely off and orange. Also more on the natural matte side, NOT radiant like it says. * This foundation does exactly what it says,"" Your skin but better"". Absolutely love this foundation."

I have decent combo skin (dry in some areas, oily in others), smooth with no acne but some mild rosacea and this covers beautifully while still looking very natural.  A little goes a long way and it stays put on me all day (I don't use a primer, just a C serum, moisturizer then this!). * I agree with the person who said it is thick and sticky. They discontinued my 22N and said 26N is the replacement. It went on like a vampire chauky  and white.  The color texture of the original formula and their colors were perfect. So creamy and gorgeous and also provided a nice little lift to the skin! Get a clue Tarte. ! If you discontinue peoples favorites they will just go to a new company. Now I have to find a new brand because nothing they have is good anymore. * Great product you only need a little for full coverage. * I live in Florida, and I like to mix with a bit of Tarte's Maracula Tinted Hydrator and its the perfect all day coverage, even in heat and humidity. A tiny dab goes a long, long way. * I would buy this again, it's the perfect shade. * I like to experiment with my skincare and make-up. However, my choice in foundation is always the same. Why? I choose Amazonian Clay 16-hour Full Coverage for multiple reasons. I love the buildable coverage, the choice in shades for my very fair skin, how lightweight it is and how it last the day. I get coverage for my redness and fine lines. I do not find this product cakey as indicated by other reviews."

Unfortunately it was not. The product separates throughout the day so badly. And looks terrible. Also the texture is so chalky and dry? Like its hard to evenly distribute it, needs multiple pumps. Overall would NOT recommend. * I am glad this was on the 21 days of beauty so I didn't pay full price. I have been buying quite a few different foundations (other than my Estee Lauder) to see what my options are. Sadly this was was extremely oily, heavy, and I couldn't get good coverage from it. Also, I did the ""find your shade"", and it wasn't a good match at all. My face feels gross, dirty and oily. Even after my setting powder. * This is the first foundation in the last decade I've bought that I just didn't like at all. I was so excited this was on the 21 Days Of Beauty. I bought it in two shades. Both oxidized fairly quickly. I tried this foundation five days in a row now all with different skincare prep and different primers hoping to love it. All five times this foundation wore me I did not wear the foundation. My skin looked better without it. Unfortunately it just wasn't for me and I would not recommend. * I love it 3rd purchase * It's the most incredible foundation I've ever tried, it's spectacular, it's light but with medium buildable coverage, it's the best. * I absolutely love the amazing coverage of this foundation and love how it feels on my skin without it feeling like a mask . It covers my redness and makes my skin look flawless without looking like a mask or too heavy on the skin . * Love this product!! My skin feels supple and glowy when applied. Color match is perfect."

D k especially not feel like your wearing makeup and does not rub off on clothes * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I  tried the IT Cosmetics CC+ Foundation and I really like the coverage. It evens out my skin tone, covers redness, and gives a smooth finish that looks natural but still polished. I also like that it has SPF built in, so it feels like makeup and skincare in one. The only downside is that it can feel a bit heavy if I use too much, and on hot days I need to set it with powder to keep it from looking shiny. Overall, it's a good choice if you want medium to full coverage with some skincare benefits. * Recommend buying the brush too. Works amazing applying the makeup. * Not only does this not blend into the skin nicely, showing every imperfection, it does NOT COME OFF. Took 2 washes with micellar water, 2 washes with gel cleanser, and a swipe of Vaseline. My skin is incredibly irritated from trying to get it off. Also it smells AWFUL. * Love the coverage of this and it only takes a little bit. I will definitely be buying this again. * IT Cosmetics has renewed my confidence with this foundation!  I am 65 years old and have more fine lines than I'd like. Foundations usually settle into the lines and powder just doesn't give me the youthful look I'm seeking. I am so glad I decided to try IT CC + Cream!  I actually find myself wearing it even when I'm not leaving the house for the day!  It just makes me feel like me again ! Highly recommend! * The lady who helped me color match did a phenomenal job and this color matches my skin tone perfectly!"

Not for problematic skin coverage. * This is my favorite ""foundation"" but I do struggle with it. It can be patchy on dry skin and it does not mesh well with most of my moisturizers. However, even on bad application days, a couple hours later I'm always amazed by how amazing my skin looks. * This goes on light and smooth. Gives nice coverage when you want to look natural. Has SPF 30. * I needed a replacement for my favorite Les Beiges tinted SPF moisturizer by Chanel, which was discontinued :(. An ULTA assistant pointed me in the direction of Laura Mercier's tinted moisturizer with SPF, which has been great (I'm on my third tube—each has lasted me about 9 months with daily use). I like how this product lightly balances out redness, gives a subtle glow, doesn't bother my skin, and is breathable. * I'm very picky when it comes to base makeup. I have dry/normal skin, a light-medium olive skintone, and I deal with dullness/discoloration. Shade 2N1 is a good shade match for me. I've enjoyed using this with a dense foundation brush. It's easy to sheer out or build up. I would describe it as light/medium coverage. It evens out my skin tone, but doesn't cover blemishes. Its very comfortable on the skin, it feels like a moisturizer, the consistency is thick at first, but it doesn't feel like anything when blended out. I can wear it without powder and it stays on all day for me. Definitely repurchasing. * I've been using this product for years!  I don't like thick heavy coverage so this is very light buildable coverage.  I have pretty good skin, 38 years old, cheeks are pink from dryness with few blemishes and this provides me full coverage.  I do add a thin layer of moisturizer (especially now that I'm older and less oily) and concealer for under my eyes, nose and any glaring blemishes.  It's a very natural finish that does pull warm.  I use 2N1 for my winter everyday color and 2W1 for summer when I'm tanned (it's very yellow/gold). * The Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer goes on nicely,  bur doesnt cover ANY imperfections. Some pilling.  I was hoping to love it, but will be returning it."

When I went into the Ulta store I told the greeter that I was looking for a foundation that wouldn't look like I was made up. This was not it. When I asked about another company's foundation she basically said it wasn't what I was looking for. * I have normal skin in hotter months and dry skin in cooler months. I purchased this during the winter. I wanted to like it bc its MAC but it made me super glowy as if I was sweating. Every time! Not my go to product for foundation. * That's my fav foundation ever, never changing it * Most foundations just go gross even with lotion and primer on my skin because of how dry it is. This seems to cover beautifully and has not left me with any patches. * The texture is silky and lightweight, yet it delivers amazing medium-to-full coverage without feeling heavy. My skin looks smooth, even, and radiant all day, no cakiness, no settling into fine lines.

The serum infusion makes such a difference it feels like I'm giving my skin a treatment while wearing makeup. It's hydrating but not greasy, and it wears beautifully for hours. I also love that the shade N40 matches my skin tone perfectly with no weird oxidation or patchiness.

If you're looking for a foundation that blends effortlessly, lasts all day, and leaves your skin looking like your best skin ever, this is it. Worth every penny! * Goes on nice and smooth. Less coverage than the higher numbers bit still great. * It feels like the foundation and powder all-in-one.  It is smooth and it stays on all day for me."

Would have liked a cooler fair shade but the lightest shade i was able to blend into my neck and make it work * I have nothing bad to say about this foundation! It offers a stunning lightweight finish that is never cakey, even long after it has set in on your skin. One thing I really love about this product is that its lightweight qualities allow either a medium or full coverage look that is perfectly & easily buildable to your liking. It spreads on the skin easily as well and does not dry or set in too quickly. It is my favorite of all foundations by far!!!!! * I purchased this foundation with low hopes because I was not liking any of the Chanel products in the last decade and boy was I wrong! I have combo skin, used two pumps to get full coverage and was shocked by the results. Gave a soft matte finish with amazing plump, glowing looking skin. Worth the money but I will say prep your skin greatly so you can get your money's worth! * Good coverage, i got the perfect shade match, looks really great on the skin and it is lightweight. I will recommend buying this and use a good primer. * This isnt gor older women oxides after awhile on your face .nithin good in it to help skin ill be returning the bottke i pickup * I love this full cover foundation.

230 is the lightest yellow-toned shade and although I can make it work in summer with some bronzer and highlighting, it's actually a full shade darker than my natural skintone and I'm not even super pale.

Alot of others can still wesr with thier dry skin; i however, cannot. When this first came out, i bought right away. I was certain it would not work because shade was a dark orangey neutral for the lightest neutral. 

I am a pale mature and dry skin woman. It did oxidize a bit BUT, it stayed the neutral amd then seemed to work with my skin and like, color corrected or something. I have no idea.  I just know that i love this, looks beautiful, stays on all day, tad bit of a glow, but not really. Its a perfect hint of something. * I sought help from the clerk for a color match.  She matched me with the wrong color and I can't use it.I use Lancome so it wasn't the product's problem. * This foundation feels very good on my skin and covers very well! * I ordered this march 2025 and have been using it and frankly i always loved this foundation. One time it was in front of me and i noticed 2024, took me a minute to realize ive been using an expired foundation since march. I got one for my mom the same day and it expires in december 2025. Ulta should not ship products that expired or have less than a year. Really upset about it, but the foundation itself is fantastic * Awesome product. I would definitely buy this again. * I went into my local Ulta for a new shade in this foundation. I was matched up and so I purchased it. The next morning, after I had applied it, I noticed the expiration date on the bottle said ""exp. 02/2024."" I was highly upset and called customer service which they did absolutely nothing about it. Not even a discount/coupon for next purchase. I called the store and  explained the story and asked if they had some that was fresh. I was put on hold, and when the employee came back to the phone, she stated all the bottles were expired and they had to pull them. I ended up returning the product and went to Dillard's and purchased the same foundation that has an expiration date of 2027. No more Ulta purchases for me!"
56,about-face,the performer skin-focused foundation,pimprod2043010,2618950," * I love this product, however, I did notice it could get a bit dewy in areas, so definitely use some blurring powder or something to kind of offset that. I don't recommend for my oily girls, I'm dry skin and it was still pretty dewy. * Broke apart within 20 minutes, even set with an extremely good powder. Skincare is the same and with the Haus labs I never had breaking apart, settling or anything. Not long wearing at all. VERY light coverage. * I LOVE this foundation. Being a black girl with olive undertones is rough. Foundation always has a grey, orange, or red overcast. Halsey and About Face you DID IT! After 27 years I've found my perfect shade match. Thank you a million times over * I put it on and for the first time I had a perfect shade match! That alone is worth it to me. It lasts longer than I have found. * Super lame coverage. Probably my fault for not examining the label clearly enough, but I assumed from past experiences that ""foundation"" meant at least medium coverage. Disappointing for the price, but I guess someone with better skin will like it. * Beautiful foundation. Coverage builds well while remaining light weight. I didn't give it 5 stars because the neutral undertone pulls slightly yellow on me, which I typically don't experience with neutral undertown foundations. * This foundation is terrible. It's so hyped up. I love the shade. I'm a fair olive. It has zero coverage. The packaging is terrible. It made me itchy, and I got horrible cystic acne. I never break out. It is dry and an oil slick at the same time.ashy"

I love the way it goes onto the skin and it leaves your face feeling soft with a subtle glow. It's so easy to color match with numbers in each skin tone category, light, neutral, etc. I love this foundation. * So pleased with this purchase! First time buying this foundation and kind of tried it on a whim! Goes on nicely and has good buildable coverage. Very happy so far! * I was veru hopeful for this product and i have combination skin on my t zone, but somehow with this product i was very oily to the touch on my whole face and felt my skin very slick after using, goes on very well and can be buildable but unfortunately was a bad experience on my end. * I am disheartened that they changed the formula. And it did not improve the product at all. Please go back to the flawless skin result * I found this foundation in cabinet while cleaning and had forgotten all about it.  I've been wearing it on my no makeup days for a subtle glow and I'm really loving the light coverage that's buildable and how flawless it makes my skin look.  My skin just glows * This foundation is pretty and dewy but it doesn't set for anything and gets greasy super fast. Definitely not long term wear, but if youre looking for something lightweight/buildable and like the super dewy look it could work. Only super bad con is how easily it transfers on to anything one touch to the face and that spot has no foundation and its on whatever touched ur face. Makes products impossible to blend because the foundation underneath doesnt stay put. * Run dont walk mature ladies this foumdation is bluring andnflawless leaving behind a subtle flown and healthy skin"
58,dior,dior forever foundation fluid matte,pimprod2036825,2604875," * Nice coverage would prefer no scent due to the added ingredients. * My favorite foundation. I've repurchased many times because I like the light weight formula and full coverage. It also has a pleasant smell thats not overpowering. I have oily skin and this keeps me nice and matte. * Did something change with the formula or did my skin change? It used to look beautiful on me the past 2 years, now it separates and just sits on my skin towards the end of the day; very noticeable where it is and where it isnt. Ive never had a foundation do that. Regardless if it is my skin that has has changed or the formula, the bottle continues to be terrible, squirts out everywhere, on my walls and clothes and therefore gets only 1 star for that. * Wish it worked on my skin but it doesn't! Oily/combo, used Dior velvet primer * I am 55 and have combination skin. This foundation is my favorite. Of course, I wear skincare and SPF underneath which keeps it from being too matte. I use a little setting powder in my T zone, and it lasts until I take off my makeup. I have never once had a problem with it transferring to my clothing, but I wear a light shade, so maybe the richer shade pigments are different. I have also worn this in all seasons with no issues. I will definitely repurchase. * It's been a struggle to make this foundation work on my 53yo menopausal skin. These are my tips that can make it beautiful if you have skin like mine.  Use a good but lightweight moisturizer. I found that Vanicream works best. And a hydrating primer is a must. I use Tarte Double Duty Base Tape Hydrating Primer. In my opinion, this looks better blending with your fingers instead of a brush or sponge. And use the smallest amount possible cause it goes from zero to cakey in a blink. And I would say not to use powder. Occasionally, I will use just the lightest kiss of the hourglass powder but it's a risk, and honestly it sets well without powder. I work 12 hour shifts at night so my makeup is on usually 18 hours and this stuff lasts better than anything, with only a little touchup needed at the end of the day. * I really have oil skin and this base makes my makeup look naturak but feels matte i really loke it"

It's not as opaque and sets into fine lines if you let it. My oily zones do push it out by the end of the day, but I'll trade shine for brkouts. * I went in store to grab this foundation. I have bad acne anthring literally can break me out, and I got one of the lightest shades. But it oxidizes so bad it went from being my foundation shade to going 2 shades darker i lighten it up with a really bright concealer but i will be returning this and going on another hunt for a foundation that doesn't break me out * Love the coverage from this product. Have oily skin and so really appreciate that this acne solution base with a great matte finish. My new go to. * Have worn Acne Solutions for many years and considered it perfect foundation for me. Last bottle I bought seemed like there was something wrong with it. It turns my fingers white and doesn't blend well and color seems off. Saw others with same complaints who said this is a new formula. Please bring old formula back or I will have to find a new foundation. * I love these foundation it stays on my face all day and I have really oily skin, I get so many compliments and it's somewhat waterproof, went swimming and it stayed on. * I love this makeup being using it for several years now. * I used this foundation for about 10 years. It was my holly grail! Went on smooth and never broke me out. However, the last bottle I purchased was nothing but a disaster. Constant break outs, it clings to any dry patches…but over all it looks extremly cakey and dry on the skin. I tried multiple different moisturizers and primers but nothing seemed to work. I then decided to look into it and read that the formula had been changed. How unfortunate…I went out and purchashed a completely different foundation of another brand that has given me no problems. I would NOT recommend this foundation."
61,fenty beauty by rihanna,eaze drop blur + smooth foundation stick,pimprod2041564,2614177," * This foundation stick is truly the best! It goes on smoothly and can be used just a little for a light makeup natural look or for a full-on glam look. It blends perfectly and doesn't crease. I'm on the older side and some makeup seems to fill my wrinkles and highlight them and this does not do that. It really is one of the best foundation choices I've used so far, and you can build on it if you want more coverage. I even use it to even out my skin when I don't want to wear any other makeup. It is my newest favorite as are most of the Fenty products. * The color match is perfect and the ease in applying and the coverage are excellent. * MAC messed up when they changed their colors, because this is what I replaced it with and I like it better! No irritation on my sensitive skin. I can't feel it, and actually forgot to wash it off one night.. no acne or irritation the next morning.  No dryness * Does not wear well regardless of the type of primer or setting powder I used. It didn't last more than 2 hours. This is genuinely the worst product I've used in a while. I wanted to like it so much but it just wore terribly. Product was silky and smooth * I use this when I travel. It has great coverage and melts beautifully into my skin. I have VERY textured, mature, combo/oily skin, and it looks amazing. I use a dry sponge to spread it, dust on powder and it lasts all day. * I love it look so natural * I did not realize this was more of a skin tint when I bought it, works wonderfully nevertheless! I usually gravitate towards foundation sticks because they're workable and clean to use, and this product is exactly that. Easy to apply and get light-to-medium coverage. If you are looking for full coverage, THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT. However, I do love using this product in the summer because it feels comfortable on the skin!"

It's a good foundation * Goes on smooth, doesn't cake and has great coverage. * I love this foundation.  I never a fan of the previous one.  I was matched with 225 and I can do 230 shades too.  I will continue to buy this foundation.  I have normal to dry mature skin.  I didn't have to powder with this foundation last all day long and it faded nicely throughout the day. * Very Beautiful finish and great for my dry mature skin.  This is one of my top 3 foundations. * Not sure if it was the wrong shade or not having a good skij prop . I just didn't like the way it made me look. * This is amazing ! It's w perfect sheer lightweight medium coverage, buildable formula. It feels like skincare with medium coverage to be exact. Love it! Doesn't have a scent to it which is perfect for those sensitive to scent allergy. Looks so dewy and smooths out the skin. It also doesnt turn orange which is why im giving all 5 stars! This completes all of my foundation checklist. * The most beautiful soft matte finish. Perfect shade match as well. Highly recommend this product to everyone. Doesn't crease or look weird. Buy this. It reminds me a lot of the Good Apple Foundation by KVD Beauty which I love so much. Try it out if you like that one."
63,hourglass,veil hydrating skin tint,pimprod2040571,2611435," * This product is really great.  I don't wear foundation or a lot of makeup but wanted a hydrating pick me up for my daily wear.  This tint is lightweight, hydrating, and I love that it doesn't feel heavy nor greasy.  It lasts all day. * Absolutely Love this Tint, completely do not compare to anything out there.  Light, silky and gives a nice even skin color. * i purchased this with my own money didn't receive for free for a fake ""good review"" anyway i loved this product. it left my skin looking nice & healthy not heavy on my skin. shade match was perfect. i wore it will i cleaned my house and wore it outside in the heat and it stayed in place. if you're looking for light coverage this is it. it's an everyday skin tint for me. i'm 9 months pregnant and don't wanna wear too much makeup so this is perfect * Feels heavy & Oily. Did not blend seamlessy into skin with brush or sponge. And oxidises. * Complimentary from hourglass I am very happy with this tinted moisturizer. It is perfect to wear in the summer months because it does not rub off. I really think this is also perfect for acne prone skin because it does not irritate me at all. * I recently was gifted by Hourglass their Veil Hydrating Skin Tint and I love it. It has such a natural finish and blends into my skin flawlessly. I have replaced my foundation and use this on my more casual days * I absolutely love this skin tint. The how to find your shade to is super accurate and overall it's just perfect for summer! Light weight and glowy! This was gifted by hourglass in exchange for my honest review but this is also my fourth bottle so that should tell you something"
64,morphe,filter effect soft-focus foundation,pimprod2022516,2577758," * This is a nice foundation, I like it but the top just falls off.  It doesn't stay on if I want to travel with it in my makeup bag, and I've dropped the bottle by picking it up by its 2.5""lid several times.   Packaging needs work.   I'd only refer it to a friend with the warning about poor ability to close it and keep the pump sanitary. * I liked this foundation a lot! It matched my skin tone really well, and is a really affordable price. It's a nice size, and usually lasts me over four months to finish. The only bad thing is that it takes a while to blend in and I find myself having to go over it with a beauty blender or brush a lot. I do still really like it though and it covers up many imperfections. * The best foundation ever!!!!!! * Patchy, greasy , I was disappointed ☹️ * Great price so, I thought to give it a try. It's not a bad foundation but not one that squeals excitement. Blends pretty well but after a while it seems to pool into lines and makes imperfections noticeable. Would probably be a good product for dry skin * I like how it blends out and has the perfect coverage for everyday use. * I like how it blends out and has the perfect coverage for everyday use."
65,urban decay,face bond self-setting waterproof foundation,pimprod2044818,2623593," * Didn't care for this employee pushed me to buy it but ended up returning it * Okay, so I picked this up during 21 Days of Beauty. I was worried about the negative reviews, but found that this is indeed sweat and humidity-proof. It's not 100% transfer-proof, but it lasted through a FULL DAY of rain and humidity in South Florida summer. Some key things to note are that it's best to swatch in person or pick a shade lighter than what you'd normally go for, as this does run warm and dark. This product DOES NOT play well with other creams or liquids, so it's best to keep face prep minimal and let it dry for at least 10 minutes before applying this foundation. If you're dry and need lots of skin prep, I'd say wait at least 20 minutes before using this, or IT WILL PILL. The same goes for liquid/gel brow products. Do your brows first and let them dry completely. Apply the foundation in thin layers and blend quickly with a brush to avoid patchiness. For blush/bronzer/highlight, stick to powders, and you should be good. * I really wanted to love this foundation…went to the store multiple times to swatch it - under store light and by a window.  And it all looks so good and well color matched.  So I was so happy this was one of the items on 21 days of beauty.  But it was a bit of a let down on the first day of use as the foundation was patchy and found every pore and lines on my face.  I tried all kinds various face prep : primer/no primer, well moisturized and less moisturized , sunblock and no no sunblock.  The only one that looked the best was no sunblock.  So this is a no go for me if I can't wear sunblock.  The color is a perfect match so I'm bummed. I think it'll work for others but my sunblock didnt like.
I want to return it but I've used it for almost a week now and I feel kinda bad… * It was to oily for my skin * Light but great coverage, plus its really hard to find a skin match and this one does the trick :) * I've been using it for maybe 6 months now, i got a new bottle like 3 months ago. I liked it at first, it reminded me of a lightweight Chanel foundation i liked. But its started to feel…heavy? Like it sits on top of my skin in a weird way, clings to any dryness, and comes out super patchy. It dries really fast so it is really hard to blend and throughout the day it just melts away now. It used to last all day. And the actual foundation in the bottle has started thickening. Its almost like it goes bad really fast. * I honestly really enjoy this Foundation I use it with either the next marshmallow primer or Maybelline poreless jelly primer it lasts all day it is super blurring on my skin I don't do much skin prep prior either for information my skin is normal leaning oily I like that you can have a custom coverage a brush will definitely give you minimum coverage a sponge is medium and your fingers will be full if you don't like using your fingers you can always build it with a sponge as well"
66,jane iredale,purepressed base mineral foundation refill,pimprod2033383,2595091," * This tops any other foundation or skin tint I have tried before (and that list is very long). This looks like your skin if it was perfectly even and plump. Does not settle into file lines and lasts sooo long on even without touch ups. Love the good ingredients and feel good about what I'm putting on my skin. I have gotten so many compliments since I started wearing it. Shade range is great too. Literally the best for reactive/sensitive skin. * This mineral foundation is my favorite and the only one I use. Liquid foundations just roll off my face. This foundation stays in place and gives me enough coverage. You can dust it on lightly or keep applying for more coverage. * I have been using this for almost 25 years, nothing can beat it. It was originally created by a plastic surgeon for her patients after surgery at her practice. Then it made it's way to estheticians and finally retail.  The coverage is fantastic. I live in Florida's heat and humidity and it stands up to it perfectly. I personally believe the sunscreen has helped me to keep the sun damage at bay as well. I saw a review that said it had sparkles. I have never seen that in all this time. Perhaps it was confused with the BM label??? I use the Real Techniques powder sponge (the one thats super light and airy) as it does not come with an applicator. Also it does not come in a compact. My suggestion is to try it and then purchase theirs after you fall in love with it or decide it is not for you. I have had my current compact for about 6 years and it is easy to pop in the next refill. There is a little hole in the back that is about the size of a paper clip tip and you can just push it out. There is a magnet that holds it in place. It really does save on throwing everything in a landfill. It finishes beautifully with PS On Till Dawn setting spray. I will say that as my skin has ""matured"" I do not try to use as much as my skin is drying up. BTW i use it as a setting powder , hence the trying to back off some as i have aged, but it is great as just a foundation too. Hope this review helps. This stuff is like a secret miracle. (I dont work for them. My friend was an esthetician and turned me on to it as I am a long time makeup fan) * It doesn't say that the product has sparkles - I don't do sparkles on foundation, it looks childish. Also, the finish is not ""skin-like"" but very mate. That's a no for me. * This stuff feels like you have nothing on your face and doesn't irritate my super sensitive skin at all. The light beige is the best color match I've ever had for my cool skin tone. The only drawback is I wish it wasn't so expensive. * Love this product. Light weight. Comfortable and covers nicely. Just blurs the imperfections without looking like a mask. I have freckles so this is perfect. * Giving this 5 stars even though I will be returning it. I recently figured out that I am sensitive to Zinc Oxide sunscreen, which explains why this broke me out, even though its ingredients are so minimal and acne safe. I got itchy and developed a few pimples from wearing this. HOWEVER! This is an amazing foundation, and I am so upset that it has to leave my collection. It's a powder, but it's almost creamy on the skin and blurred the flaky texture on my cheeks. The coverage was a perfect medium but could be built up. I am combination dry and acne prone, and without the zinc oxide, this would've been my forever foundation."
67,dior,dior forever fluid skin glow foundation,pimprod2036824,2605019," * I have rosacea and little bumps on my cheeks due to my rosacea. I pump 3 full pumps on the back of my hand, apply it to my face with a foundation brush, and I'm done. The finish is absolutely gorgeous, especially when pairing it with Huda Beauty's Cherry loose setting powder under my eyes, my nose, above my lip, and my chin. It's necessary for me to find a good foundation and a good powder because I live in Phoenix, AZ. As soon as I step outside, the heat beats down on me. The SPF in this foundation is obviously not enough, so first I moisturize with Pond's, put a 60+ SPF sunscreen cream on, Power Grip primer, then my foundation. My foundation has never looked so good! I don't care what anyone else says, but I love the scent of the foundation. I feel so pretty and luxe when applying it and smelling it. I'm on my second bottle and I will definitely be purchasing it again as it is my new regular foundation. I only hope that maybe Dior considers adding more SPF to it, but not if it changes the current formula. * My favorite foundation I mix it with elf halo glow. It's the best foundation I've used * This has so far been the best foundation I have found for my mature skin. I am so far happy with it. I am a week in and still happy!! * The finish was very greasy and blotchy. I tried with several different applicators and primers. I have textured, dry skin. Would probably look great as light coverage on clear skin! * This is my go to foundation. Absolutely love the color match and the sustainability of the product. * I love this foundation but the smell is outrageous! I cannot take it. I smelled it for a couple of hours. I never write reviews . * It feels great, and initially goes on great. I always use the Porefessional primer w/ any foundation.. then a sheer setting powder. Well my normal 2 foundations look great all day, pores look normal. The Dior lasted a couple hours before creeping all in my pores- making them stand out too much. Don't recommend if u have somewhat large pores.. mine r like medium craters w/ no makeup- lol"
68,anastasia beverly hills,"medium coverage, natural finish luminous foundation",pimprod2008586,2551421," * After four bottles and shaking it vigorously, it stays seoarated with white cream stuff. Formula changed and company isn't cooperative. Lots of other reviews say same. Avoid. Too much money for this foundation. * I bought this foundation with the expectation that this might be a game changer because of the price and the reviews.  What a waste of money.  The foundation does NOT look luminous or natural in coverage (contrary to the text on the box) – it actually looks dry and cakey.  I suppose, if you have perfect skin and applied heavy moisturizer to your face first, and then applied this foundation, it may look luminous but so would every other foundation on the market.  Why this company, with its 'Beverly Hills' label, thinks it's foundation product is worth what they charge, is ludicrous, unless their marketing strategy is to attract idiots that want to blow a wad of cash on expensive crap.  I will never buy this product again. * I ordered this for the first time and was very impressed! I like how easy it is to blend and the shade match is really nice too. * this has been my everyday foundation. especially in cooler months but honestly can be used ask year long. I found my perfect match for both my pail & tanned skin tone. I will be devastated if it's discontinued. I have dry skin most of the year & this foundation paired with my favorite moisturizer & primer (both not of this brand but pairs well)is my perfect combo. will continue to use until it's discontinued & I run out of my stash. * I had great hopes for this foundation because of all the good reviews. I found the foundation to be hard to blend, cakey and clung to dry spots that I didn't even know I had. And yes I have a good skincare routine, I moisturize, use a primer and setting spray. Not for 60 plus year old skin that tends to be dry. * I have tried everything to make this foundation work and nothing helps, accentuates every pore and imperfection. Terrible for mature skin. * I have tried everything to make this foundation work and nothing helps, accentuates every pore and imperfection. Terrible for mature skin."

I love it for my ""no makeup"" days where I want to conceal dark circles and blemishes but don't want to shellac my face with a ton of concealer. Works wonderfully with my mature skin too! * I ordered on line 7/2025.The product arrived with expiration date of 5/2023.Ulta was great and  sent out a new one.The new on arrived,unfortunately it was the same lot number and expiration date.I love Ulta they refunded my money. * It fits perfectly on my skin tone * Ive never used a foundation I like until now!  Ive been using this one for over a year and plan to keep on using it! * I have tried several expensive name brand foundations and I had a reaction to all of them. My face would get beet red patches. Tarte is the only makeup that doesn't irate my skin. It's very natural looking. Makes my face look smooth and healthy. I also use Tarte lip gloss, tinted  moisturizer, mascara, under eye concealer, and shimmer. Highly recommend! * This Is, my favorite foundation. It blurs out pours lines.

This was litterally the best skin tint i ever owned * This is the best tinted moisturizer I have tried! I have combination skin so my skin is very particular about what products I use.

I never been a fan of thick foundation and this product has saved me from looking cakey. I love by itself and when i do a full face of makeup. * You would think this being advertised as clean ingredient based that it wouldnt break you out and the niacinamide would be a great additive to this.

It's not like it used to be at all. I had to switch brands. * Complete formula change and completely disappointed….it doesn't stay on, creases and settles into lines and pores. I tried it with several preps and setting sprays spending extra time and money to compensate for what a bad foundation it is now.  At the end, it's just a very expensive, terrible performing, high maintenance messy product that is absolutely not worth it. I won't purchase this again, the bottle I did purchase was returned. * I used to be a NW15, which matched my skin tone perfectly. Now, NW15 is nowhere near my skin tone. The Ulta associate told me that MAC updated their packaging, along with the product. Be aware that you might need a shade match when purchasing. * It left me feeling cakey didn't blend in with my coverups. * Highly disappointed with this new formula. It has a pump now, which I thought might be a good thing, but it's not. There's no cap on the pump so foundation gets everywhere and creates a mess! The foundation itself….huge fail! It's completely different to the original and not in a good way. It doesn't stay on, it creates a greasy, splotchy, chalky finish that does not look good. I've had drugstore foundations that look better than this. I will not be buying this foundation anymore, the bottle I purchased was returned."

I knew this before reading the reviews but I wanted to give it a chance… I tried everything to keep it safe lol but it still broke. right now it's in my makeup bag wrapped in toilet paper to keep it from leaking out. 

still a great powder though… * This is best powder foundation for a smooth flawless finish.  The only con is that it breaks easily:( * ULTA failed to package properly so this item came  BROKEN!!!!  I would recommend the item but not for shipment. * I used it one day and loved it,  but next day when I opened it all the powder started falling out, it started with just one part but now all the powder base is complety ""broken"" I can use it but very carefully and unable to carry it with me :("
73,chanel,les beiges water-fresh tint,pimprod2030055,2574253," * This is a definite no makeup look. It simply adds color and a very slight blurring effect to perfect your natural skin. Do not expect coverage from this product because there is none. This tint is refreshing and cooling to apply but needs to be blended into the skin well. I prefer to use my fingers rather than the brush included. I find a little goes a long way and it is slightly buildable. It is hydrating but gives a natural finish rather than dewy. It's a unique product. Expensive, but if it's a look you love it's worth it. Your skin will look like your skin but better. * This is my first Chanel product I have tried and it is amazing. The coverage is sheer and its perfect for summer. You can apply it so many different ways and continue to build to the coverage you would like. One of my new favorite products. * I would but again * Absolutely stunning on the skin. No, I don't like the price - but NOTHING is better than this. This is by far the best base product in my collection. It is very light coverage, but it just evens out your skintone in such an ethereal way. Perfection. * At first I could not believe how much this costs for doing so little haha. why even bother it doesn't cover anything? definitely not for the girl with rough skin. But it actually is lovely. I grew to love it for natural looks * If you are looking for medium or full coverage, you will be incredibly disappointed. If you have great skin and only need a little help evening out, this is perfect. I recommend doing your research before buying. Look at the negative reviews, and see what other products that user also reviewed negatively. Solely based on their previous purchases and feedback, this was never the product for them. The one and two star reviews are misleading. The description is spot on, this is intended for a sheer to light, radiant coverage and provides just that. It's intended to enhance skin that needs minimal help. This is a great product, when used as directed. * OMG. This is it. This is the holy grail. I have been searching forever for a light, airy, barely there foundation that won't cake on my dry skin and make me look older than I am. And I found it. As long as it doesn't break me out I will be in heaven."
74,clinique,even better refresh hydrating and repairing makeup foundation,pimprod2004194,2541677," * This foundation is such great quality and lasts all day and the best part is its good for your skin and helps wirh hyperpigmentation its so great ! * This is the foundation that me & my family all wear. Clinique has no other foundation with full coverage & a natural finish. I'm so bummed I'll have to find a foundation to use in a different brand. * Love this foundation for my combination skin. * I won't even allow this product to come near my face. It contains an astonishing TWELVE separate forms of silicone (including dimethicone as the 2nd ingredient, following water). This has more silicone than most silicone-based face primers, so if this is what you are seeking, just buy a cheap silicone-based primer and powder; I think you'd end up with a similar result. Even with all it's additives, it still lacks sunscreen (chemical or physical), although the thought of adding sunscreen to this already pore-stifling mixture makes my face sweat just thinking about it.

With a name like Clinique, we except you to formulate proceducts with skin-loving ingredients. Cosmetics companies can no longer get away with adding whatever cheap ingredients they wish in order to achieve the façade of temporarily healthy skin. Consumers have educated themselves and we know too much now.

Do better, Clinique. * Great product * I had high hopes for this foundation since it was described as for very dry mature skin.  Nope, too thick, wrong color choice (my mistake), no matter how lightly I applied it still caked in creases & wrinkles. * Easy application and coverage."
75,kvd beauty,good apple skin-perfecting hydrating foundation balm,pimprod2022990,2577085," * Yes, a little goes a long way and I use my fingers to blend, but it's fantastic, the color match is perfect and is hydrating and covers the lines and texture on my 49 year old face. I totally recommend for dry, mature skin. * It works great for me. I was looking for a light hydrating makeup with full coverage that is vegan and cruelty free and this seems to be it! * This has been my everyday product for over five years. There is not a day where I don't use it, I have been using it as my bronzer. There's nothing like this in my opinion. I have sensitive skin and I'm prone to break out and this has never made me break out. I have gotten many of my friends on it. You won't regret it! * This is my foest review ever. I felt compelled to share my experiance with this product. First im a makeup artist and esthetician. Im Picky when it comes to my clients, and of course my own makeup. When I say i have tried every foundation under the sun, i sincerley mean it. From extreme high end, department store, spa grade, boutique brand, indie brand, drug store etc, you name it and ive either tried it or worked with it. This foundation right here checked ALL my boxes. I am oily but dehydrated on my face. I bought this a while back and used it once and put it in my back of my vanity!  Went back to estee lauder. My makeup got to where i just was not pleased with the look of my makeup so i said ill give kvd another try because i see all the youtubers working with creams so i said what the heck. After learning the correct skin prep and correct tool for this forumulation i can say i am very VERY well pleased with this product. I have textured creapy creasy pores etc and this product make my skin look perfected in everyway. Played great with all my other products as well. I used all nighter setting spray to lock this product in and it wore for 11 hours in 104 degrees nc heat and still looked great before i removed it. Very very well pleased. I will be buying a back up and all other kvd products! * Not sure why I didn't keep using this. It's perfect for my elderly dry skin, goes on smoothly, spreads easily. Plan to continue for sure. * As a practical makeup girly- this is a product I have purchased back to back. I absolutely love the flawless look it gives me. I'm 35 years old with oily skin, I use this for my everyday, corporate job, natural look. * You only need a little bit, but this is the best for my aging, dry skin."
76,chanel,les beiges healthy glow foundation hydration and longwear,pimprod2030080,2571508," * I have been wearing Nars foundation for about a year.  I noticed some issues so decided to try a few other foundations.  As soon as I tried this one I was like wow.  This goes on like a moisturizer.  It's so hydrating. It doesn't settle into fines lines. It's very smooth and has a nice scent.  I'm 54 and have sensitive skin and this works great for my skin.  I bought B20 and the color matches my skin perfect.  I have dry skin and this is a perfect foundation for those with a more dryer complexion and who need that moisture throught the day.  It is a little pricey but to me it's worth the investment in my skin.  Give it a try.  I'm sure you will notice a difference with your skin in a positive way. * Unfortunately this foundation did not make the cut.  I have been trying to find something to replace my go to, Chanel's Vitalumiere Aqua , which apparently Chanel has taken off the shelves to reformulate . 
Chanel's Les Beiges Healthy Glow foundation seemed to be a fit color wise but the scent is overbearing, the coverage is splotchy and it melts right off. * Ehh I wouldn't repurchase, it's pretty and wears nicely throughout the day but the cons outweigh the pros to me. I need complexion products that work with other complexion products and this does not do that. * This is one of the best foundations I've ever used. I usually attend a cycling class during lunch, take a quick shower, and head straight back to the office without reapplying makeup. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the foundation still looked flawless and radiant on my skin. I absolutely loved it. * Really like Aqualumiere, but wanted a bit more coverage. Performance was the opposite of marketing claims - cakey, drying, felt heavy, accentuated texture and looked like makeup. The cool shade was orange, which is actually a warm color. Returned. * Is oily and emphasis every texture and pore on my face, it has fragance that lasted all day and my skin texture looked worse than when I dont use make up will be returning * Goodbye foundation.

I like the coverage and SPF! I'll keep using it until they stop carrying it. I never use the pump, and I just use the applicator wand. It's easy to cover my face using either a brush or a sponge."
81,nars,light reflecting advanced skincare foundation,pimprod2030141,2591148," * I wanted so much to love this foundation and make it work, but it just didn't for me which is sad because it did help my skin.  It oxidized on me, settled into every line, wrinkle, and pore, and looked like a shiny mask. The amount of money I've spent on this foundation and trying various things to make it work is obnoxious so I have to replace it. * Switched to NARS after using Estee and I love how dewy (but not too dewy) and natural this looks on my skin. Feels natural without feeling heavy. * This foundation is absolutely gorgeous. It goes on beautifully and stays throughout the day. It is definitely a dewy finish it that is what you are looking for. Unfortunately i could not get past the smell. I am not super sensitive when it comes to smells, but this straight up smells like im putting bug spray or something on my face. Its not just a light smell either its very strong and pungent. * I do get hormonal breakouts at times (I'm 53), but not THAT bad, I really think this made my skin break out. And the match quiz did not help me, Valarius is too orange for me. Pretty disappointing and a waste of quite a few dollars. * I've spent over 25 years wearing EsteeLauder, converted to Revlon to break up costs and to get a tad more moisture as I age.  EL I'm Cashew color.  I was matched up Barcelona (which was too light for me) or Valencia (which was too orange for me). Revlon I have to buy 2 colors to mix.  Nars, well I love their blushes.  Their foundation seemed to be loved by many,  so I thought I'd try out of boredom.... first off, when I say it's runny,  I mean,  you literally need a drop. its almost like I dumped an entire bottle of serum into my foundation.  Yes,  that's how runny it is,  even when rubbing into my face.  I looked like a wet wax face.  It felt uncomfortable like I wanted to itch it off. Even with a setting powder it was wet.  Other makeup did NOT blend well at all either. Side note,  I have PCOS, so I need full coverage.  This is probably the furthest from medium/full/build able coverage.  So it's a huge no for me.  Not only that,  during the day I kept getting a wiff of something rancid on my face.  I have sensitive skin. Made where I shave,  turn red and seap through.  I'll stick with what I use.  Love Nars, but not the foundation.  Probably perfect for people who want a BB cream lol * I wore this foundation for a full day to do a wear test and see how the product looked from running around all day... I'll give it a 7/10.

Shade match (Oslo) was perfect!... for a hour. Got in the car, flicked open the mirror, and BAM! Orange! Nothing else wrong with the product though. 

I'll compliment the formula. I have combination skin and a lot of products get patchy around my nose and the apples of my cheeks. This foundation didnt, however, I did have to apply multiple layers for full coverage. Definitely buildable!

If the product didnt oxidize so much it would've been 10/10, 5 stars, but I did end up returning the foundation. * I did not like this.  Texture was like an extra thin serum and I found it hard to work with.   Also settled into wrinkles."
82,chanel,vitalumiÃ¨re aqua ultra-light skin perfecting sunscreen makeup broad spectrum spf 15,pimprod2030103,2528581," * I have bought and returned endless amounts of foundations in the past; I'm sticking to this one until the day they stop making it or switch the formula. You get the no-makeup makeup look effortlessly. I don't use a brush or sponge to apply, just my fingers, and a dime size covers my face. I got lucky; I stocked up before y'all sold it out! Yet, I'm glad you all found something that fits well! * Great color and application however through out the day starts to leave my skin a little greasy. * I've bought this twice now , trying to get it to work for me. I've used it with primer, no primer, fingers, sponge, brush. Its always peels and looks terrible. I'm pretty knowlegable when it comes to makeup and I've used alot of different foundations. I love Chanel and love some of their other foundation, but not this one. * I've been wearing this for 4 years and will never buy another.  It goes on light and easy, adds a nice luminous glow to my skin and provides even and light coverage. * Thank goodness ULTA Carrie's this now!! The ONLY foundation that does NOT settle in your fine lines and I have mega lines still doesn't settle, I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION, please chanel never discontinue this! * I love how my skin feels with this Chanel foundation it looks and feels so smooth. I've been using it for five years now. * I've literally tried 5 foundations in the last 2 months all claiming to do the same thing. I have acne scars very large pores deep smile lines that collect the makeup.... And I'm 53. All the nightmares!!!!  This foundation!!!  I mean common!!!  It covered everything!  It blurred the pores on my nose, which nothing ever has, it didn't settle it those deep lines, even the ones in the corner of my mouth!!!  I looked Dewey all day!  I felt like I was wearing nothing. It wasn't even the right shade cause they were out but I just used a bit of bronzer and omg perfection!!  I will never ever use anything else. Yes it's a bit fragrant but that disappears in a few hours no big deal."
83,smashbox,halo healthy glow tinted moisturizer broad spectrum spf 25,pimprod2016307,2568499," * Goes on nice and light like a bb , also fades quite quickly .  Good for minimalists * okay. if there is any review you listen to let it be this one. the product is ungodly hard to squeeze out of the package. it dries INSTANTLY and flakes everywhere. It is streaky and DRYING. the shades ranges are all tones of YELLOW. WHO WANTS THAT. * I've sold this to OLDER women and it looks phenomenal. I did their skin prep correctly, the ones that says it accentuates lines and texture it does NOT. I have textured skin from acne scars. The GOLD, extracts, and oils make your skin bright and smooth. * I love Smashbox. I use their Superfan mascara, the photo blur primer, would buy the photo finish setting spray again and again but I guess it's been discontinued. I used the Halo foundation and it matched perfectly but within two hours I started to get little red pimples which turned to whiteheads and I don't break out unless it's that time of the month. I had little zits in places I have never had them too. I will be returning tomorrow. If it didn't cause a breakout   I would definitely keep. * I'm a pale olive complexion so I have been on the hunt to try to find a tinted moisturizer that has an SPF that is actually my color. This one is absolutely it! However, you have to work with it. Try it with different types of moisturizers underneath and I recommend letting it sit for a few minutes before doing any other make up after you put it on. And it's one of the few products that looks better throughout the day as you wear it which I'm extremely surprised to say because that's not usually the case. It does not oxidize to another weird color or turn orange. I'm going to cry if they discontinue this. * I love it so much! Have been using it for years! 💗
Wore it for a wedding and my graduation 💗love how natural it looks! * I've tried this by itself and it gets cakey and separates every time looking at the ingredients it is water based yet still has silicone which is basically like mixing oil and vinegar"
84,polite society,more than a pretty face skin-caring foundation,pimprod2040619,2615146," * This is my favorite foundation to wear. I don't normally write Ulta reviews but I have spent so much money on different foundations and I've finally found one that works for me. I'm 41 so I have aging concerns and I have combination skin. This doesn't make me break out, it doesn't crumble or crack, or settle into face lines. I don't even have to wear primer with it. I bought it on a whim because it was on sale for cheap, just to give it a try and I can't believe that i got so lucky. * Spreads smoothly and looks very natural. Love it * After seeing several people review this, I decided to buy it when it was on sale... thankfully. This foundation appears to blend, but any amount of moisture makes it bead up again. Attempting to use powder to set just made it worse. I will not repurchase. * I am a 60 year old woman and have tried a lot of foundations, but this is hands down the best one. It doesn't settle in my lines and goes on my face smoothly. It has a very natural finish and it lasts all day with the setting powder by Polite society and a setting spray. I wont use anything else now. Perfection. I also love that the foundation for very fair skin has cool pink undertones. It is my perfect shade and so many foundations dont offer this. Thank you Polite Society! I sont ever want to be without this! * Literally the best foundation i have tried. I have oily skin plus i live in the south so it doesn't take a lot for makeup to slide off me but this one will stay with minimal skin prep. Not to metion it actually matches and as a pale pinky toned girl who can't tan it is truly a godsend. It doesnt cake it looks beautiful and i am obsessed with it. * In the Florida heat and humidity this foundation does not move or look greasy. Lasted all day and looks beautiful and natural on the skin.
L O V E! * I get complimented on this everytime i wear it. My skins sensite and combo. It doesnt seperate or cause oilness."
85,estÃ©e lauder,futurist skin tint serum foundation spf 20,pimprod2041704,2612381," * 1st I want to say I haven't worn it out yet, but I did a little sample on the back of my hand & I'm literally blown away! I love their concealer so I thought it would match well, but never imagined it would be perfect! I did the ""try on"" feature with two different photos with the recommended shade & the shade i thought was best. Ultimately chose the one i was recommended & it's an absolute perfect match! I would rate 5 if I actually applied it to my face, but even though it's the back of my hand it's a perfect match!! Also, my skin feels smoother on the application side, it's not transferring onto my sheets, nor cellphone. * Used to love their products, still would if they wouldn't DISCONTINUE them without warning. Cant even leave a review on the products I did like because they dont exist anymore. I don't know how they expect to maintain brand loyalty if they can't even deliver a consistent product. Never had this problem before and I won't risk it again by continuing to use only Estee Lauder products. They are too expensive for that level of abysmal customer serivce. * This is one of the worst skin tints ive used 😅. Ar first I thought it looked great, I tried my usual routine that should've worked with this product, but about 20 mins after I finished my makeup it looked cakey, patchy, and just overall gross. It also oxidized several shades darker so I looked ridiculous all day with an oompa loompa face and white neck 🙃. Stay far far away, there are SO many better tints at a fraction of the price! * This is one of the worst skin tints ive used 😅.

Stay far far away, there are SO many better tints at a fraction of the price! * Recently purchased this skintint as a way to just cover up some redness i have. I love the finish on it, the lightweight consistency. The biggest issue i have is i cant get it to blend into my skin…i do have very dry skin due to medication but this would just clingy onto the dry patches i have and i tried with different primer nd nothing has worked, so i don't recommend at all if u have dryer skin, very disappointed especially because of the price point * Love the coverage for my skin type. Beautiful full coverage without a caked on look or feeling. * I've been struggling to find a serum foundation that matches my skin tone. They're all either too dark or too light. I figured I'd try a more expensive one and hope for the best. I am fairly disappointed. While the color matches great, the dropper use basically just aesthetic because it doesn't work at all. The foundation when applied and spread it pills and doesn't spread very well at all."

If you have dry skin the foundation does feel nice without it being too heavy. * Man I wanted to love this foundation, but before I even put it on my face I hated it. It was sooooooooo runny. I mean soooo runny. Then put it on my face and it was horrible. I had to return it. I do love the Morphe eye shadows though. Very pigmented. * I loved how this foundation looked for the first month of wearing it but after a while it started to break me out badly, don't recommend if you have acnd prone skin!!! * This foundation is amazing! If you get your proper shade it seriously looks like nothing is there! I 100% recommend! Very light weight aswell! * Best foundation I've tried at this price point. Wears great, full coverage without settling into lines. I put my makeup on around 6:30 am and it still looks amazing g when I'm done at four. Definitely on my list of repeat buys. * My daughter and I have used the filter effect foundation and it's now discontinued,we have this a shot while I don't love this lightform I don't completely dislike it but I'm not sure if it's the formula or the dispensing pump but it makes a huge mess * I am almost 45 years old, and this has been the best foundation I have found!  It is hydrating, has flawless coverage, smooth snd silky to put on. I thought i would have to useca different foundation for the summer, but it still gives me the perfect amount of hydration for the summer."
88,estÃ©e lauder,double wear sheer long-wear foundation spf 19,pimprod2027234,2586142," * The Estée Lauder Double Wear Sheer Long-Wear Foundation in shade 1W1 Bone has become my go-to for a lightweight, polished everyday look. It offers the perfect amount of sheer coverage to even out my skin tone without feeling heavy or cakey—my skin still looks like skin, just smoother and more radiant.

I love that it lasts all day without oxidizing or sliding off, even in warmer weather. The added SPF 19 is a great bonus for daily sun protection, and the formula plays well with both moisturizers and primers underneath.

If you're looking for a breathable foundation that holds up beautifully while still letting your natural complexion shine through, this is it. A little goes a long way, and the finish is effortlessly beautiful. Total staple in my makeup bag! * I bought this from Ulta and was so excited to try it.
What a disappointment! It was so runny and watery. It didn't really even do anything for my complexion. I've used Double Wear Stay in Place for a long time, and I wanted something lighter for Summer. But this stuff should not even be called a foundation. It's not a skin tint either. For the price point of over $50.00 it was a complete waste of money. * I absolutely love the look & feel of this product. Great for everyday natural & i can build up for more coverage. I set it with the BareMinerals Originial Loose veil setting powder in Translucent. And it lasted the full 12HRs!!!! * This was my favorite foundation for a while now but my shade has dissappeared…really dissappointed. Why is 2N1 just gone? * I've tried three of four BB creams, sheer foundations, etc. Two of which broke me out in hives and one that was just plain awful. I came across this, and figured I'd try it since I like the original Double Wear foundation. I love this! It's lightweight, evens my skin tone, has SPF in it, and has decent coverage. Plus, it does not break me out! Will definitely purchase this again. * This ""foundation"" gives no coverage and it's so watery. I put it on my face and immediately wiped it off. I wanted a lighter feel than double wear foundation but it's horrible. * This foundation is terrible. It has no coverage and never dries. You will walk around sticky all day, which I hate, but you may not mind. It was sticky and wet even after setting with powder. I will be returning it."

Nice medium coverage I would say. Goes on great with fingers or a brush. Gives a nice glow but not oily. And no fragrance which I appreciate * Ive tried MANY high end foundations and this has been my favorite. It lasts all day, its buildable, doesn't crease…its underrated. * It blends perfectly with my skin and works well with other products. It is dewy and moisturizing. I used shade medium and have a warm undertone. It matches my skin so well I could use it with nothing else (such as powder/blush/bronzer). * This has been my go to foundation for years now. Beautiful dewy finish but never looks oily on me. Great year round foundation. I apply with a damp beauty blender and get a medium coverage. * For both my summer and winter shade this blends so easily with my skin, great for neutral undertones. Covers dark spots with no concealer. Great medium coverage that can be built up. Perfect for ppl looking for a stand alone hydrating foundation with a little more coverage than a BB or CC cream. * I have been wearing this at least 5 days a week for the last 4 years so I can confidently say I will be purchasing again. I wear my makeup for 12-14 hours and this lasts ALL day, has a lovely dewy finish and is very build able."

It provides light blurring coverage with a natural finish. In the attached photo, I am not wearing primer. The wear time is half a day or so before I felt that it had really worn off. I will use it for light days, but do not plan to repurchase as I have other foundations I have tried that I felt worked better for me. * Worth every penny! Love this foundation! * I have been using this foundation for a few months now and it has not disappointed.  Yes, it's pricey but dang it's worth it!

I don't think anything will, and I was hesitant to try this out due to a lot of negative reviews. I'm very pleased with the coverage, longevity (oily skin), and shade range! * I was honestly not going to buy this based on the reviews, but I did anyway because this has a fair olive shade which is difficult to find. this foundation is a great match for a pale neutral-warm olive, and it feels like im not wearing makeup (sensory friendly). 

I am allergic to a lot of makeup but not this. it did not cause my acne prone skin to break out."
95,maybelline,super stay 24h skin tint + vitamin c,pimprod2039657,2610817," * This foundation is very long lasting and i don't have to do touch ups throughout the day. I would compare to Farmasi foundation. Full coverage a decent price. * Im always trying new foundations and skin tints. I have acne prone skin and redness so i struggle finding something like a skin tint, but also has a good coverage until now. I feel like every skin tint i try is so thin, its honestly pointless but this one is fantastic. You can make it light and thin but can also build it up. I even use this on a full beat look and its fantastic. Seriously do not have one bad thing to say on it. * I've been using this product for over 2 years, and I LOVE IT! * i wasnt sure what shade i was so i used the shade finder. that was such a big mistake, it was way too warm toned and almost orange * This may be a con for aome since its considered a skin tint, but i absolitely love the coverage on this! Ita not thin on application like a skin tint usually is, but instead has really good coverage, without feeling cakey or thick- i got two shades so i have a winter color and summer color and i love them all. I go back ans forth between this and a standard foundation and always go right back to using this no mather the circumstances because it gives me whatever type of coverage i want. I have acne prone skin & this still covers acne with no issues for me! Probably my favorite yet! * Im so pleasantly surprised by this product. Ive been using for a few months now. I have to say it is as good and in some cases better than my high end foundations. I find myself reaching for it over the others regularly. It goes on light snd yet covers in a natural gliwy finish. It diesnt settle into my fine lines. Stays beautiful all day. I am 56 and have dry skin. I'm in love! * This is great for my 58 year old skin. It covers but looks so natural."
96,l'orÃ©al,true match super-blendable foundation,pimprod2034733,2602421," * I was surprised and how wear this wears! The coverage is just want I needed and It does not dry out my skin. * This is a great foundation. The price is perfect and the shade range is great. It feels very light on the skin. I love that you can thin it out or build it up for more coverage. The only con is that it shows all texture on the skin. Ive tried different primers and techniques but no matter what all texture is so obvious with this foundation. * I had to purchase without shade matching/testing, and grabbed two shades. one for when I'm tan, and one shade lighter for when I'm not. I have no idea how, but they were absolutely perfect matches and looked great on. it wears great, has an insanely beautiful finish, and is a true medium/buildable coverage. I've heard so much about this foundation and usually use a super expensive tinted moisturizer with SPF when I do wear makeup, but had an outside summer wedding to attend and wanted something with more staying power and coverage. this was perfect! compares to high end without the ridiculous price tag. * im a very pale female ans because of that i got recommended this foundation. at firts i was hopeful since a EMPLOYEE who was also VERY pale recomennded it. as soon as i put it on you could tell sm was up taht it wasnt the same shade as the bottle. however i let it sit. 10 minutes later i look and it looks like a BRUISE it became this rlly ugly like yellow color that looked like when you first get a bruise and its sorta yellow it was so bad. i had to wipe it off and redo my makeup. DONT RECOMMEND. * one of the best drug store foundations i've used! * I am a life long consumer of expensive foundation. I've wasted so money on the wrong colors and shades that don't quite work. I'm stunned that C3 is the best and most natural match I've ever had. * Absolutely JUST LOVE this foundation long lasting and just BEAUTIFUL on my skin and has a natural finish look !! Its now my #1 Foundation that i will be repurchasing for now on!! 😍❤️"
97,estÃ©e lauder,double wear stay in place matte powder foundation refill,pimprod2031253,2593713," * I love this foundation. I first tried the stay wear liquid but I found that I like the stay wear powder foundation better. I have combination skin with hormonal acne and it doesn't aggravate my acne at all. I usually just get a under the skin bump or two on my chin a week before my cycle and this foundation doesn't make it worse or aggravate it in any way. I don't have any injections or fillers and I have some fine lines and it doesn't sit in those lines making me look older so I definitely like that. I take good care of my skin and  believe in aging gracefully. I know I am getting older and the wrinkles are coming but thats okay with me. My smile lines are from the wonderful smiles and laughs I've had and I wear them proudly. I eat a healthy diet, workout every morning and I only drink water and my skin reflects that and looks healthy. Just because we age doesn't mean we won't look good anymore. Healthy, glowing skin is beautiful at any age in my opinion. So, I use this powder foundation all year round and I definitely recommend using a good primer for your skin type before applying this foundation. It definitely keeps it looks good thru your work day. I use to solely use Clinique and I still use their eye shadow, mascara, blush and skincare but I had a good friend introduce me to this foundation and I literally ran out to get it lol. Just remember every day you wake up is a gift and a chance to shine :) * Once I apply Esstee's  Double wear foundation I use her compact powder to set the foundation.  It is a perfect complement to the foundation. * Love products * I wear 1c1 in winter but 2c1 in summer,I love how easy it is to change out shades with these refills. It's a wonderful, flexible formula that's never cakey. * I buy ivorynude (one if the lightest shades).The color mathecs perfects, at first. However, with a couple hours, my makeup looks a couple shades darker. I have worn this on my tropical vacations and it holds against water, still looking perfect. If you buy a couple shades lighter, it may work for you. * Love the smooth look 👌 * I am 47 with normal to dry skin. Full coverage long lasting!"
98,dior,forever natural nude foundation,pimprod2036826,2604394," * This foundation is amazing..it's as if the Forever Matte and Glow had a baby.  It gives such a beautiful satin finish that is not too matte and not too glowy just perfect. I will definitely buy this again and I've recommended it to quite a few of my friends and they love it as well! * I have been trying to decide why I am not reaching for this foundation and I have come to the conclusion I may have gotten an old bottle. The texture is thick and gel like; not what I would expect from a ""nude natural"" foundation. Looks cakey. and when I shake it I don't hear or feel any movement in the bottle. It doesn't really smell spoiled although it does have a fragrance as Dior does. I have tried thinning it out with oil or moisturizer but then it doesn't dry down as it should. I am disappointed but don't know if it's actually the product or that I received  an old bottle. Unfortunately I tossed the box. It's not impossible as I have received  expired products from the warehouse on a couple of other occasions. But I have definitely had better foundations that cost less. * I was not wowed by this foundation. maybe my color match wasn't the best. I am fair to light with a neutral leaning slightly warm complexion and I don't think there is a great match for me in this product. I did not find this product to look very natural or give me any sort of radiance. I felt it looked semi matte rather than a natural finish. Coverage was fine-light to medium as expected. I much prefer Chanel's Healthy Glow foundation. I have mature skin and think perhaps this foundation is better suited to a younger customer. I didn't dislike it but I would not repurchase it. For me it looked rather flat no matter how I prepped my skin. * This is a fantastic foundation! It's lightweight and  leaves me looking naturally flawless. I will say it doesn't completely cover dark spots/acne but I am personally fine with that- nothing a little concealer can't help with. I will definitely be repurchasing. * Wonderful product! * This is the best foundation that I have tried in at least the last 5 years of searching for ""the one"".  Not too heavy or too light. Not cakey and does not settle into my fine lines. This foundation lasts throughout the workday and well into the evening. Definitely worth the price. Finally!  I've found the one!! * Here's a quick review you can use for Dior foundation at Ulta:

""I absolutely love how smooth the Dior foundation applies to my skin! It blends effortlessly, giving me a flawless finish that feels lightweight yet provides great coverage. The formula feels luxurious, and it lasts all day without creasing or feeling heavy. Whether you're going for a natural look or building it up for full glam, this foundation is a game-changer. Highly recommend trying it out—you won't be disappointed!"""
99,mac,studio radiance serum powered foundation,pimprod2040797,2613967," * I found this foundation to be very heavy on my face and it didn't look natural. When I went into the Ulta store I told the greeter that I was looking for a foundation that wouldn't look like I was made up. This was not it. When I asked about another company's foundation she basically said it wasn't what I was looking for. * I have normal skin in hotter months and dry skin in cooler months. I purchased this during the winter. I wanted to like it bc its MAC but it made me super glowy as if I was sweating. Every time! Not my go to product for foundation. * That's my fav foundation ever, never changing it * Most foundations just go gross even with lotion and primer on my skin because of how dry it is. This seems to cover beautifully and has not left me with any patches. * The texture is silky and lightweight, yet it delivers amazing medium-to-full coverage without feeling heavy. My skin looks smooth, even, and radiant all day, no cakiness, no settling into fine lines.

The serum infusion makes such a difference it feels like I'm giving my skin a treatment while wearing makeup. It's hydrating but not greasy, and it wears beautifully for hours. I also love that the shade N40 matches my skin tone perfectly with no weird oxidation or patchiness.

If you're looking for a foundation that blends effortlessly, lasts all day, and leaves your skin looking like your best skin ever, this is it. Worth every penny! * Goes on nice and smooth. Less coverage than the higher numbers bit still great. * It feels like the foundation and powder all-in-one.  It is smooth and it stays on all day for me."
100,maybelline,super stay up to 24hr hybrid powder-foundation,pimprod2036593,2603936," * 12+ hours of coverage, that will hold up in humid summer Weather, this is my tried & true. Matte. Buildable formula, versatile, light handed with a fluffy brush or pack on with puff for more coverage. On  ""dry"" days, mist with a hydrating spray. * I was looking for something to replace my beloved elf camo powder foundation after they discontinued it but this one is not it. The coverage is nonexistent, and texture is just chalky. Wish i could return but sadly tried too long to make it work and missed the return window. * not a good product for those with large pores or any texture. also wears off so quick * Like the name implies, this is definitely more than just a powder. I can wear it over a good primer instead of foundation and setting powder on some days. The finish is amazing!  The color selection is very good and this is great for touch ups at work or out and about. I keep one in my desk at work as well as my purse, love it!!!! * I have used this on and off and find it is a good reliable powder that always has a smooth and matte finish and wears well. I find the formula very matte, so it can be dry. Affordable and accessible. I would recommend to those with normal to oily skin. * Gets the job done in summer when it's hotter and more humid. Applies easily with a foundation brush, doesn't get cakey or dry. No need to blend since it's a powder. Powder blush goes over it and blends easily. I also like how quickly and cleanly this applies, vs. liquid products. * This product contains silica which can damage DNA and the nano particles can help your skin asorb the harmful ingredients of the other trash makeup you're buying!"

102,tarte,amazonian clay blurring powder foundation,pimprod2036934,2604704," * Love Tarte products * Only powder I will ever use! Has a great matt finish and covers so well! * Creamy, yet light. Feels good on the skin. * I usually use the shape tape pressed powder foundation, but i wanted to give this a try. Definitely going back to the shape tape because this makes my skin feel like clay by the end of the day. The shape tape foundation usually doesnt lift on my jose after wearing my sunglasses, but this powder comes right off and theres no blending it back to look normal. I also feel like i have to wash my face sooner bevause it feels so tight and uncomfortable after 6-7 hours of wear. I felt like i looked cake-y right after application too, and thats not a normal thing for me. Im going to finish the powder, but I won't be purchasing this pressed foundation again. * I have tarte's Amazonian clay liquid in my rotation of foundations, and loved the coverage. I wanted something to cover my shiny nose mid-day, gave this a try. 

This is just awful. Streaky somehow even when applied with a brush. I'd say it sits on top of the skin awkwardly, but I think it actually breaks the laws of physics and hovers several mm above the skin out in space, yet still streaky. If i use enough to combat the oily nose sheen, then it looks like pancake makeup. Using setting spray is not useful, because that causes it to settle into every texture on my face. I end up needing to constantly mess with this to get it to look good, exactly what i was trying to avoid by using this powder. 

I've tried everything. * There are very few options for powder for the minimal make up gen xer that I am. Sometimes I just want to cover some of the shine, so hopelessly out of fashion of me I know but real life skin has things that I want to cover and foundation powder had been my friend for many years. Out of the slim pickings this was my choice. Immediate negative was that the pan was loose from the compact and I had to find my glue dots to fix. The coverage is fine and I like the more minimal compact but I don't think it would survive in a purse. Which is the clutch point as to why i love powder compacts, you can put them in your bag and they survive. Absolutely loved playing with my grandma's compact and wish that beautiful compacts would come back because we need something easy and elegant in this world. * The pressed powder is very fine and delicate, creating a natural makeup finish that looks like naturally flawless skin. It doesn't control oil or provide coverage, but I don't think that's a big issue because it's already incredibly convenient."
103,pat mcgrath labs,skin fetish: sublime perfection foundation,pimprod2040434,2613894," * I got shade 2, and it pulls WAY too yellow; I looked like I was having kidney failure. I couldn't even focus on the finish or feel because it looked insane. I was really bummed because I've waited years to try this foundation. * This foundation is very ""watery"" which I was warned of but it doesn't bother me and it goes on nicely. The coverage is light but buildable. My skin is prone to oxidizing foundations terribly and this is the best foundation I have found that doesn't oxidize as bad as others on my skin. * this is an amazing foundation. the only con is the bottle. it WILL squirt all over you if you are running low so DO NOT apply in your going out outfit. it stains your clothes * This product has such a light consistency, ince it dries down its like wearing nothing. Lovely medium coverage that can be built upon. Makes skin look perfected and lasts all day * This is such a beautiful foundation. It give enough to cover redness and uneven tones but still looks natural and not heavy. You dont even know you have anything on. Beautiful for mature skin. * Since my diet is vegan it is important to know that my favorite foundation is vegan as well. I get THE MOST compliments on my skin when im wearing this foundation. It is extremely lightweight and goes on like a dream. Perfect amount of coverage and never streaks or cracks. Amazing quality worth the investment. Nothing else beats this! * I was not sure about this after seeing complaints about stinging, tightness, and so on. I use a high strength retinol in the winter so skin tends to be sensitive and dry now (Jan.) I was pleasantly surprised that this serum felt great for me. Obviously, lots of people are sensitive to this, but I was lucky. It actually feels hydrating.

It is easy to blend but the ""runny"" reviews are 100% correct. I build in a number of passes or just use a good concealer + a couple of pumps.

Now, the color choices. Even for a lighter coverage foundation, Ulta's availability of shades was inadequate. I got a ""yellow neutral"" shade because there were no pink or just neutrals in my depth in stock. It works ok since I usually do not build coverage, but I don't understand why they added neutral to descriptions. It is a straight-up warm foundation, although it is not as intensely yellow as some other brands. 

I am not sorry I purchased and wear this every day. Not sure I would recommend at this price point for most people for the trickiness of application, difficulty matching, and risk of sensitivity. I would probably repurchase but only with full shade range like other brands with 40+ (not sure if we can name?)"
104,hourglass,vanish seamless finish foundation stick,pimprod2020481,2575932," * She went on so nicely, that at first, I was obsessed. That quickly dissipated as I wore her throughout the day. She broke apart, leaving a weird finish on skin. It still looked ok from afar but the moment you got close it was a disaster. I tried and tried again. I thought maybe it's my sunscreen, my serum, my moisturizer. But no matter what I switched out, the same thing happened - goes on great and breaks apart in an hour or two. I returned her :( * I have oily/combo acne prone skin. This product is great on my oily sections and provides a full coverage. It has an insane amount of product, I have used a lot of it and ive had it for over a year yet still have half. It can cling to my pimples a little bit but as i wear it through the day it blends into it. * I have used Hourglass (which I prefer) as well as IT Cosmetics and both have changed the description for their products (from a name to a number and vice versa). I have a number on my Hourglass stick and unfortunately can't reorder online. So frustrating!
IT doesn't even have the description on the product so that sealed the deal for them. Makes no sense why they make it so hard for the consumer. * Good color match and formula. Problem packaging, amount of product, and price. The product was stuck to the cap. I was able to get the product out and place it in a tiny jar. Packaging needs redesign for the price. Can't recommend for this reason. * No matter which technique I try, the outcome is always the same: it cracks, transfers, and looks terrible after just half an hour. It exacerbates my acne, making me feel like I've wasted my money 😞 * I was really excited to try this foundation as I have heard a makeup artist I watch on youtube obsess over it for years. I tried this foundation two times and returned it after the second try. Both times I wore it, it gave the same poor results. This foundation does provide full coverage which was exciting to me, but the longer I wore it, the worst it looked. I could almost tell after a few minutes of having it on, it was alresdy breaking down on my skin. Very disappointed. I wish it would have worked. * I was really excited to try this foundation as I have heard a makeup artist I watch on youtube obsess over it for years.

I bought the lighter cool shade (90 I think) to start and realized once I was in store that it was going to be way too light. Application was easy and felt nice, and I like the glowy but not sparkly finish. As a side note, the long wearable lipstick is also still going quite strong on day 2! * I love this product. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars because it does burn your eyes if you sweat or water gets on your face and in your eyes.  But I love the coverage and how it makes my skin feel. * I don't usually wear makeup, so I usually opt for light coverage, and this did the trick! I really liked the dewey finish and all day wearability. I had no problems with it * I was so excited for this but it was horrible. It made my skin flaky and didn't look good at all. I had to throw it out. * I love the coverage and finish * I love the coverage & stay power. Can be worn under foundation for more coverage. Took a couple tries to find the right shade. * Love this since i don't like to wear foundation, this is really lightweight and glowy, perfect amount of coverage."
106,hourglass,ambient soft glow foundation,pimprod2033509,2599657," * I have tried everything out there. Finally found this gem. Looks so natural complexion looks flawless. Light weight. I have mature skin and have lots of spots covers great with little color correction. Little expensive but a little goes a long way. Definitely worth a try * It clung to every dry patch no matter how much I prepped and it separated. * I don't usually write reviews, but I felt like I had to this time—just to give some insight before you spend your money on this foundation.

First off, I LOVE Hourglass. I've been obsessed with their concealers—they've been my go-to for so long—so I really thought I'd love their foundation too… but sadly, I was super disappointed. This foundation is not it.

For reference, I've used Estée Lauder and thought it was decent, but I was still curious to try this one. I always prep my skin well, but even with that, this foundation went on patchy and came off so easily. Ijust didn't sit right. I've never had this issue with my past foundations. Like… what?? 😩

Just wanted to share my experience in case it helps any of you. If you're looking for a reliable, everyday foundation, I honestly don't think this one is worth the price. :( * For context, I have combo to oily skin. I tried this foundation for two weeks. No matter what prep I did, no matter what I set it with, it highlighted every pore and line on my face. It looked cakey and greasy (I used less than 1 pump). It does provide good coverage, and it doesn't feel heavy on the skin. Just didn't work for me. * I had an appointment in the salon for formal makeup for a masquerade ball, and the artist doing my makeup pulled out this brand to use and it was the most perfect shade match Ive ever seen for my skin, I went and bought it immediately * I tried my best to love this foundation but I have oily skin and after an hour this foundation transfered to snuthing I touched. Did not stay sll day. I tried preping my skin, primer, setting it smd bsking it nothing worked. If I touched my face bevause if whatever readon the foundation would come off!!! Very disappointing becsuse i love how light weight it is. Definetly not worth the money. Might go back to estee lauder * I love that this foundation does NOT oxidize on my skin! Feels super lightweight and doesn't even look like I have a full face of foundation when I wear it. Will definitely be getting again once I run out!"

My daughter found this for me and so far i absolutely love it. The color match is perfect.  It goes on so soft and smooth and there is not a weird or strong smell. * Good coverage. * The first time gave me a rash so I waited a couple of months to make sure it was this and I tried it again and gave a red bumps all over my face. I'm not the only one. There's a lot of bad reviews w the same effect. * Excellent powder foundation for older women.  I don't know why my color doesn't seem to be available anymore though.  What's going on with the limited shade offerings?  Fenty still has all 50 shades on their website! * Ive been using this powder in shade 150 since it came out. All of a sudden theres no lighter shades? Not even one around the color ive been using. I've probably went through 10 of these compacts, and am beyond disappointed. Def gives me the ick for the brand!! * Perfect match for my skin tone. * I did the color match online and they matched me with a Shane that is not even available anymore. At the store I matched with 210 and the consultant said they are not going to carry that shade anymore. why would this supposedly inclusive brand cut all these different shades from their lineup? Now I guess I have to find another brand to buy powder from."
109,covergirl,simply ageless skin perfector essence foundation,pimprod2042952,2618803," * I bought this because I heard it was a dupe for a high end brand.  At first i didnt really care for this foundation but im almost done with the bottle and now I really like it.  I like that its lightweight, hydrating, leaves skin plump and healthy. It also evens out skintone and stays in through the day.  You do have to work it into the skin a little bit to get a even application because of foundation droplets. I like to use a flat (round)foundation brush. Its a very light foundation .. maybe even a skin tint.  Works wells with creams and powders.  I like mixing in some bronzing drops while applying. * I would have given this a higher rating, but this foundation irritated my skin. It made it dry, and small bumps started to appear, as well as making my pores appear larger.  Which is too bad; I would have liked this otherwise.  The first time I applied it, it evened out my blotchiness without having a thick layer of makeup on my skin, but my skin texture got progressively worse every day I wore this makeup.  So, it's not for me. * I love this stuff! Helps even out my skin tone, and for acne I spot conceal. Lasts all day for me (with setting powder and spray) and it feels so lightweight. I like this better then any high end product. * nothing ive used gives the same best-skin finish without looking like im wearing makeup. It also pairs well with all types of concealers, cheek and powder products. 

I know it's a bit expensive for cover girl but this formula is really excellent, and I like it better than what its duping bc it has zero scent. Also a bottle last 8-10months if used everyday. Just need small little dots for a naturally perfect skin look.

Keep this one around Cover Girl! * I absolutely love this product!! I was going to buy it myself, but im so thankful it got sent to me!! I love that the beads come together to create a nice lightweight coverage. The packaging is super cool too!! * Absolutely in love with this from the moment I tried it. It was gifted to me and exceeded my expectations! Coverage is great without weighing on my face, and looks so good on my skin!🩷 * This was beyond amazing!

Hours later I looked at myself and saw that I resembled an Oompa Loompa more than I'd like to admit. Not judging if you're going for that look, it's just not for me. I didn't want to show my face but look at the color of my neck vs my cheek. It was originally the shade of my neck but it turned orange. * I tried this ColourPop foundation and I just love it. The moisture it provides gives your look a facial glow and a wonderful fresh feel. I will definitely purchase this product again! * This foundation is amazing!! It has a beautiful finish on my skin.

They're all a little too orange. * I will definitely buy it again. * Smooth and even application, blends nicely * I tried four shades in this product and none worked.

It makes my skin very dry and cakey. * This product has nice light coverage.  I mix 2 colors to achieve my perfect match, and I apply with a brush in a circular fashion.

Please, please never stop making this! And thank you from my heart for creating magic in a bottle! * This is one of my favorite foundations I've tried! The coverage is very matte-natural and blends so well into my skin. It does great blending with other cream blushes, contour, and bronzer as well as liquids and powders. I love how it's kind of a hybrid between a BB cream and a foundation. A regular in my bag now! ily ari 🤍 * I bought this foundation almost a year ago, and i will say it has its ups and downs. I have really dry skin and texture so I will say that this foundation brings it out just a bit. I think if you use the right products before hand like moisturizer and primer, it'll look great! * This foundation looks cakey and settles into fine lines and actually makes them look worse. If you accidentally tap your face even a little it comes off in patches even with powder and setting spray. It also doesnt pair well with moisturizer underneath at all. * I dont know why more people arent talking about this foundation, its absolutely amazing! Makes my skin look like mannequin skin."
114,chanel,les beiges water-fresh complexion touch,pimprod2037597,2595874," * I discovered this at the airport. Tried it on but didn't purchase it right then. I got to my gate and as I'm waiting for boarding I looked in the mirror by the window in natural daylight, it was flawless! I had to have it lol. So I walked/ran a 30 minute round trip back to the duty free from my gate to get this! That's how much I loved it. I've had it 2 months now, i wear it nearly every day and I'm about halfway through the bottle, a little goes a long way with this. Even though it's a thin consistency you think you need more, you really don't. (I'm 50 btw) * The best foundation i have ever tried for my 40 year old skin! This smooths over absolutoly everything from acne scars to fine lines to big pores, and it is seemless and understandable on the skin. It doesnt sit on top of skin or add any texture. I hope Chanel keeps this forever!! 

I tried water tint and it's fine. I feel like it performs like many other tints and makes me look greasy. This newer touch one leaves me flawless! I've gone theough hundreds of foundations looking for this effect. I love this so much. I get compliments everytime I wear it. Never discontinue! * Finding a water based foundation is difficult. I stumbled across this foundation about a year ago and have used it ever since. In the beginning I had some trouble getting it to look good on my skin. I realized I had to MIX till it was uniform and then put it on. With a powder on top it looks decent, it's thin and non blurring so my texture shows just a little bit. It's been workable, it doesn't break me out and it being water based helps keep my grease prone skin in check.  I am falling out of love with it recently. The most recent bottle feels different in some way. It feels greasier. I look pasty and it gives me uncanny valley vibes. I am pretty pale, but not sickly looking like this foundation shows me to be. At the price tag, I don't care to go and buy another shade. It has been my go to for so long but I am ready to branch out to other water based skin tints. I'm sure this works for people so I'm not going to say I don't recommend it, I am not offended that after a year it stopped working for me. It's thin, but will quickly build and be cakey if you put too much on. It's not something I could ever put on my skin without powder to set it. * I have tried many foundation formulations and this is hands down the best for radiant flawless skin. My skin is on the dry side and no matter what foundations I use they sit on my skin and show flaws. This foundation is very light, but covers beautifully and helps balance skin tone. A little goes a long way so the less you use the better and best applied with a foundation sponge. My daughter also purchased this foundation and her skin is radiant. A must have worth the money. * This is an odd product. Luckily the Ulta associate provided me with a sample so I was able to return the unused product. The beads are odd and the coverage is uneven. * So soft on my skin I love this for the days I don't wear makeup! * Do not make a shade light enough for my fair complexion nor do they make a shade light enough for my friends"

I don't have to layer it, one drop is enough for my whole face! It lasts me all day, and gives me a matte look! * The full coverage is amazing. * This is the best foundation I have used. It goes on smoothly and has full coverage. It covers the imperfections I have. * I wish I could leave a before and after picture.  I can not use any other foundation that gives me the coverage I need for my pigmented skin.  I use four different tubes to highlight blend and I BEAT that face you hear me.
Eyeshadow is amazing as well."

I like a multi-tasking products. * I LOVE this foundation. Perfect Match. I heard it was discontinued and was so bummed. But it isn't!!! Thank goodness!! Here it is. I have an extremely hard time finding a match for my pale skin. Thank you soooo much! Buyer for life.. * Great makeup either an older people like me and they're 60s covers blemishes and age spots pretty well * Honestly it's pretty great! Color matched perfect and the application feels more like foundation w/ light coverage. I apply it with a beauty blender, finish with Elf hi-Def setting powder and I'm out the door! Try it for yourself :) * For a long time, instead of using foundation I used either Shape Tape or Born This Way where I need it most and would just blend it out onto my moisturizer.  This summer I developed some really bad sunspots and no matter how much corrector/concealer I'd use, my skin would look grey where the sun spots were.  One day, I tried this because I had gotten a sample and omg it has saved me!  I finally felt comfortable going out again without thinking everyone was staring at me.  The weird part was, it wasn't as heavy or full coverage as my concealer but worked 100x better.  Well, I'm finally at the end of that little tube and also, I now need a lighter color, so here I am.  

This CC cream is better than any other I've tried, it somehow has great coverage but looks incredibly soft and natural.  I'm also able to use it where I need it without seeing lines of demarcation.  This is most definitely an unsung hero and I'm baffled as to how it doesn't have a better rating. * I came in today looking for the tarte BB cream, but saw the cloud CC cream and went with it instead.  It matched well, covered great & has a light feel.  However, I got home and went on the tarte website only to discover it's already been discontinued.  😩 WHY?!? * I love Tarte. Not my favorite foundation, but its great for every day or summertime."
118,exa,high fidelity foundation,pimprod2019009,2573283," * ECSTATIC IN AN UNDERSTATMENT!!! I have been searching for a foundation like this for YEARSSS. (I have super sensitive combo skin leaning dry. Liquid foundations always look terrible on me after 1 hour. I do great skin prep too!) Lightweight, breathable foundation, quality ingredients, minimal ingredients, fragrance free, light to medium coverage, skin like finish, 6 to 8 hour wear still looking flawless, doesnt dry my skin out, doesnt irritate my skin, doesnt cling to dry patches, COLOR MATCH ON POINT, skincare ingredients, AFFORADABLE, anti-pollution (I live in SLC, worst air quality/pollution here) I  literally cried when i first put this foundation on i was so blown away at how perfect it was. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NEVER EVER discontinue or reformulate. I am a customer for life and this foundation has changed my life. * very skin like finish! no fuss foundation. * This is an undetectable foundation on my mature, dry skin, though it can build easily for extra coverage. I will just add additional drops on those darker spots, which still peek through but look more homogenous. But coverage is not my main concern, so this winner maintains the slightly dewy glow over a well -prepped skin base, still looking un made-up by the end of the day. Also, goes over mineral sunscreen flawlessly. IMO it is on par with Haus Labs, Nars Radiant LIght, MUF reboot; my other favs. I am trying another shade, though am happy with Katey, the match I found via the skin models- so that's my recommendation for finding your shade, rather than the description. It is on sale, so... TRY IT! * I'm assuming this foundation is on clearance because of quality issues… I received my order and the formula is completely separated and cannot be mixed back together to a good consistency. * I was so surprised when i first used it, my skin looked like skin. I like a lightweight natiral finish and this gives me exactly that! It also stays on all day/night, only thing is that it oxidizes a little bit but not wnything drastic. Has been my go-to foundation for over a year already! * good match for hard shade (fair/light olive) and good for sensitive/acne prone/scar/texture skin. decent coverage but feels light and natural. but doesnt really set (makeup smudges on my cat) & taking the top off pulls the entire pump out sometimes * I have used this foundation for a few years and it's never let me down. I fluctuate between a range of their lighter, cool toned shades depending on the time of year. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. A few things I've learned along the way: 

*A thin base layer will cover most spots and uneven tones. If you need more coverage, then spot treat with a little more foundation.
*It pairs beautifully on top of Nudestix tinted sunscreen.
*Applies well with brushes or sponges, but better with your fingers.
*A stippling, dabbing motion is the best method to apply the thin layers.

I'm 41, and I receive many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation, and I feel like I look more youthful with this on. I will definitely continue to repurchase!"

I told her I had mature oily skin and I wanted a lightweight foundation with sunscreen. She picked this Bare Minerals serum foundation and put a small sample on my face. Honestly, it looked pretty nice in the store but by the time I got home the product had settled into every fine line, wrinkle, and pore. I thought it was just because I hadn't put a primer on and decided to keep trying at home. NOPE -- still horrible in every way possible. To make it worse, the cap doesn't come off easily, and in my efforts to twist and turn it off, I accidentally loosened the lid and foundation went flying EVERYWHERE. Took forever to clean it off counters and mirrors because it just smeared. Horrible product and packaging. I don't know how anyone can successfully wear or even use this product. * I love bare minerals and have used the original loose powder foundation but it wasn't sitting right on minute skin anymore so thoigh I would try the serum foundation.  Still did not work well with my dry skin. I will be returning * I bought this last year and have used it a handful of times. It is the only makeup I've ever bought that I can wear for long periods of time and not have zits/acne forming under the surface. But while it looks great when applied, after a couple hours it separates and settles into all my pores and its not a good look. On the hunt for a similar product line that doesn't have this issue. * This used to be my go to foundation for years I dont lnow when they changed the formula and shades. I went online and used a color match that said my original Aspen 04 is now fair nuetral 15. It was wrong the color is totally different and had a orange undertone. I havnt been able to find the righg shade with these new colors so disappointed. * I'm a bareminerals girl but this is the worst foundation ever made. Its greasy, doesn't dry, doesn't blend, looks terrible no matter what you do to try to make it look okay. They need to redo this. I can't believe they ever allowed this terrible foundation on the market. * If your skin is well prepped, well exfoliated, and well moisturized, this foundation is awesome. If you're more like me, though, and you're someone who doesn't have time to do a full prep every morning, you might want to avoid this one for daily use. The foundation likes to settle into any dry spots and can accumulate in creases. Application of this foundation is a bit more technique sensitive compared to other foundations. For special occasions where I have the time to do a full skin prep and very carefully apply this (the consistency is very watery and almost a little grainy?), I really like this foundation, but for daily use (aka I have ten minutes before work to put on makeup) I'm not a fan.

I will probably buy this again, because it does have a beautiful finish and it is one of the few foundations that actually matches my skin tone, but this is not my go-to daily foundation."

I have used this in the past no problem,  this time it seemed dry and thick. I looked it up manufacturing date,  over six years ago! I don't understand why all Ulta is selling such old products?

I like the consistency and the ease of using this with a brush, though I'm sure a blender sponge would work just as well.

Have been struggling to find a good foundation that didn't look like foundation. This is perfect! Absolutely love it. Stays in place, doesn't fall into wrinkles and fine lines. Looks like skin and not a bunch of makeup on my face. I am very happy! * Its reasonably priced for a skin tint, but its a bad product for me. Horrible shade range, greasy, and not something I would buy again. * Starting with the positives, the formula of this product is very gentle and skin-friendly. I have extremely sensitive skin that's also acne-prone and this didn't irritate my skin or break me out. The color-matching is also great, it matches my skin perfectly. However, the coverage of this product is so light I barely tell the difference between wearing this and rocking my bare face. It doesn't cover up my acne or acne scars at all. It also creases very easily. For such an expensive product, I thought this would fix all of my skincare woes, but alas. It did nothing. Save your money! * Terrible! Made my face extremely oily! And my color match is darker than my actual skin tone. This is hoing straight to the trash! * My skin loves this foundation and shade 110 is the most perfect shade match I've ever found (and I've tried many foundations). 

Unfortunately it does transfer easily even with setting sprays. Not good for work if you wear a mask (like healthcare)."

This serum foundation works wonderfully well on my mature skin. Too me, the shades are a bit off, but workable if you are skilled. The lids snaps on. * Glad I had a makeup stylist that was patient  and got the color n coverage just right. * The formula of this foundation is genuinley gorgeous and works on the skin so well. It feels very hydrating on the skin and leaves a satin finish. HOWEVER, my god the shades are not it. I got the shade 11.5c, which is supposed to be more cool tone. It is SOOO orange. You have to use a blue color corrector to kinda even it out. You can still make it work with the other prodects and make even for you skin, but most people shouldn't have to do that. So overall, they need to help the product not oxidize because they genuinely could have something solid here. * I love in FL and gave this foundation a try.  It wasn't right for me.  After applying and going outside within 2 hours it looked like I had no foundation on.   Did not protect my skin from the elements either. * I have combo skin, I am tan with neutral olive undertones. I tried shade 12.7NC in store & it looked like my perfect match however it oxidized a few hours later. It was very slight oxidation compared to Too Faced Born This Way & Fenty Filter Pro. I decided to order shade 12 online. I am really impressed with this shade & how well or paired with Elf Matte Primer. I really like the texture & it feels like I have nothing on my skin even after using Huda Beauty's Loose Powder. It's a must have for me & I will not be using any other foundation for the near future:) * Yes!!! I would highly recommend this skin silk serum foundation. Love how lightweight it is but it also provides you with a beautiful natural coverage. I just purchased a second bottle and I will continue buying it. * I bought this in a whim, and am glad I did. I am 68. I have stayed out of the sun over the years, and now use sunscreen every day. I still have a decent complexion. I don't need heavy coverage, so this foundation and a good concealer is good for me.  I will be repurchasing it, and trying other Revolution products!"

Its got amazing coverage, and when i had acne it didn't accentuate it one bit. Now that Im in my mid 20s i still reach for it, it doesnt feel heavy and it lasts me all day. It has to do with technique too, on any foundation tbh, I prefer to build and blend until I get it just right. I love the applicator too. * I started using this foundation in 2022 and havent used a different once since! With acne (cystic) it easily applies and as long as you dont touch your face too much it lasts for hours! This product seriously changed my life.

Not too thick or chalky. * I wanted to love this foundation so much because JP is my favorite makeup brand so it kills me to give a less than satisfactory review.

However, it transfers so bad!! 😭 its to the point where I cant hug people before it gets on their clothes.

I live in Jackson, MS and this stays on all day in the sum

I'm definitely a skincare rule-follower, so my skin was well prepped by my normal routine (exfoliation, moisturizer, primer). I didn't test the 16 hour claims, but I can attest to 7 or 8 hours of flawless looking skin.  It does have a little bit of scent, but that seemed to fade pretty quickly. * Easy to apply, it gives you medium coverage that looks like your skin. It's matte and perfect fie combo skin. Everything sits beautifully on top of the foundation. Its a great product for the price. * I found this powder foundation online and wanted to give it a try. I used the color chart online and it said I needed the color Vanilla, but upon trying it, turned out to be VERY light and also not really a foundation. I exchanged the Vanilla color for 2 shades darker and it's much better now. I use this as a powder to very lightly cover my face at the end of my makeup application. Feels soft and stays put. Happy with my purchase and I expect this to last me a long long time. Thanks, Ulta!!! * I would buy Essence cover and last again. This project gives you full coverage and stays on all night.

The cream to powder is perfect, its so lightweight and you can make the coverage as light or full as you want. It bkends like a dream and the color match was spot on. Would definitely recommend! * I absolutely love the cream to powder foundation. It provides full coverage but doesn't feel heavy on the skin. I would buy over and over again. * I have been wanting to try this foundation for a while,  as I love some of the other Milani products, but one of the drawbacks is it can only be purchased online. I finally ordered it and it's ok. I took a quiz to see which color I should order since I've never ordered it before. Again it's only available online, so I can't go test the shades in the store. I am usually an ivory shade in other brands so I got the 220 creamy natural. When it came in, my first reaction was ""oh no"" my fear of ordering the wrong shade came true as the foundation looked really dark and orange. Since I already had it, I decided to test it anyway knowing full well it would not match, but it sort of did end up matching. The dark orange color was just like a film and it was lighter underneath and it blends really well. It feels really lightweight and breathable. It almost feels like you aren't even wearing make up, which makes sense since I found it to be very light coverage. I was hoping for medium to full coverage, but it just evened my skin out like a BB cream would do. I would still recommend it for the price, but wouldn't compare it to the KVD as that's how it was promoted to me. * I took the shade match quiz, the shade was way too light and when applied looks cakey and clings to dry patches. * I got this foundation in the lightest shade and its still too dark and orange. It cakes extremely bad even with two lifht layers. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone! * The cream-to-powder formula is fantastic! I use it alone (no concealer, highlighter, bronzer, blush) and it works great to cover up my acne scars and even out my complexion. However, I have noticed that it breaks me out really badly. I wish there was a clean formula for this type of product. * Right texture for me"

Good for minimalists * okay. if there is any review you listen to let it be this one. the product is ungodly hard to squeeze out of the package. it dries INSTANTLY and flakes everywhere. It is streaky and DRYING. the shades ranges are all tones of YELLOW. WHO WANTS THAT. * I've sold this to OLDER women and it looks phenomenal. I did their skin prep correctly, the ones that says it accentuates lines and texture it does NOT. I have textured skin from acne scars. The GOLD, extracts, and oils make your skin bright and smooth. * I love Smashbox. I use their Superfan mascara, the photo blur primer, would buy the photo finish setting spray again and again but I guess it's been discontinued. I used the Halo foundation and it matched perfectly but within two hours I started to get little red pimples which turned to whiteheads and I don't break out unless it's that time of the month. I had little zits in places I have never had them too. I will be returning tomorrow. If it didn't cause a breakout   I would definitely keep. * I'm a pale olive complexion so I have been on the hunt to try to find a tinted moisturizer that has an SPF that is actually my color. This one is absolutely it! However, you have to work with it. Try it with different types of moisturizers underneath and I recommend letting it sit for a few minutes before doing any other make up after you put it on. And it's one of the few products that looks better throughout the day as you wear it which I'm extremely surprised to say because that's not usually the case. It does not oxidize to another weird color or turn orange. I'm going to cry if they discontinue this. * I love it so much! Have been using it for years! 💗
Wore it for a wedding and my graduation 💗love how natural it looks! * I've tried this by itself and it gets cakey and separates every time looking at the ingredients it is water based yet still has silicone which is basically like mixing oil and vinegar"

BEST. foundatiom EVER. And I refuse to use any other foundation. It has a BEAUTIFUL. full coverage finish while being effortlessly dewy and feeling lightweight. This is THE foundation. I am incredibly picky with my foundation, and this is thr only one, high-end or drugstore, that i wear. Please, never stop producing it.

I have pretty good skin and got away from using foundation. I just use tarte shape tape under my eyes and around my nose/chin for redness. But I wanted a little something just to enhance my skin. Everything either has sunscreen in it which I do not want or looks like like I put highlighter all over my face. This does not have any shimmer or glitter like the CT Hollywood filter. This provides minimal coverage but gives your skin a glow. You can always spot conceal if you have a blemish and this goes nicely on top. I can also see using this under or on top of higher coverage foundation for a dewy look. If you have extremely oily skin I do not think it would work but for normal to dry its beautiful. The thing I can compare it to most is milk makeups skin tint, but that clings to dry patches and separates. This does not, its perfect! * I love this brand. * Love this product! So glowy! I wear this instead of foundation and it works perfectly! * I am returning this product. I gave it a try but it is sooo greasy and I usually like a more glowy foundation. Less coverage than a bb cream lol and needs soooo much powder to keep it on but stays kinda sticky. I hate it lol * Ive been using this for about a year and a half now, and i love it!!! 

I switched when I found out my E.L.F glow was making me break out. Ive had zero problems since then! 

Im not a foundation or full coverage girlie so putting ny consealer ontop of this really does give me the full face make up look, without feeling sooooo heavy."
141,jane iredale,beyond matte liquid foundation,pimprod2008017,2552811," * This makeup did not sit well on my skin. It showed every pore and imperfection. Including any dry skin and did not cover well at all. I wanted to really like it but it didn't work for me * I love this foundation, its like your own skin but better. * At this price I'm pretty disappointed. Color match was great and does not oxidize, but that's where the pros ended for me. Definitely not full coverage, didn't blend well and shifts/splotchy. If you're an oilslick like me… this is a total waste. Maybe good for dryer skin? Going back to Dior at this price point and won't be purchasing this one again. * This foundation brought out texture and wrinkles I have never seen before. It is not very blend-able, as it takes a lot of manipulation to look somewhat acceptable. This product is very drying and I have oily skin. Not to mention it does not adhere to the skin, it slips and sides off your face throughout the day leaving you patchy. * I finally found my holy grail foundation, I didn't even buy it at Ulta but that's how much I loved it to write a review. It feels like I'm wearing nothing, it matches my skin perfectly which has been a nightmare for years trying to find a good match. * This coverage is a lot more sheer and dewy than I had anticipated. This would be a beautiful foundation for someone with dry, mature skin since it does not crease. The colors are not accurate either. I suggest ordering one to two shades darker. * I need to keep looking. I have a full bottle that I hope to find someone that it works for."

143,maybelline,instant age rewind eraser treatment foundation,pimprod2043641,2620458," * I used to use this foundation when i first started wearing makeup in middle school. I bought it again recently for my natural ""no makeup days"" for a quick sheer cover up for my acne marks. It is a nice foundation for people who want a light to medium coverage. Definitely not full coverage. Although its good, i think there are much better options out there. This foundation can be very greasy, so if you have oily skin, be sure to set it and touch it up throughout the day. It also applies very streaky. The applicator makes putting it on very quick and easy, but since it can be very streaky, blotchy, and greasy, youll have to spend extra time blending it and setting it. 

This product was great when i was younger but i wouldn't repurchase now. * I'm 50 and have used foundations at every price point from drugstore to luxury. This is my favorite (I'm buying my second bottle) because it doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything on my skin. It covers well without being heavy or cakey. I use it as my concealer as well. I would prefer pump packaging because with the twist-up you can't gauge how much you're dispensing, but I can get past that. Great, unsung foundation! * Great job on covering the blemishes. * I am picky about color shades and there is Many colors to choose from * It worked like a greasy highlighter on my face, highlighted flaws I didn't know i had. Although I like the sheer and shimmery tint I didn't find it useful enough to keep it. * I love how it goes on. Looks great on my skin. * As a pale girl I NEVER can find foundation that's fair enough.  Not only is this a shade match, but the wear is smooth and pretty- and it's hard to mess up the application.  Sponge/Brush/Fingers.  Also primer/no primer the product goes on well."

It feels so nourishing and applies so evenly. It's light yet gives a good medium coverage. A great summertime weight. Not heavy but yet just enough color. Love it. Buy it. Give it a try. I think you'll like it. * This foundation is so perfect for me. It blends perfectly into my skin. It's so easy to apply. I just dab it on with a beauty sponge and I'm done in minutes! 
I love it ❤️ * I'm not sure why my skin reacts to foundation so terribly, but even the luxury brands make me look a little off. I know my undertone and have been able to pinpoint my exact color profile, so it's not that. Foundation usually sits on top of my face, amplifies my fine lines, and makes me look like a hot mess. Age Perfect Tinted Balm is the only foundation that makes me look better, and I wish I knew about it sooner. It's my favorite! * I have what the skincare industry refers to as ""mature ""skin. I am a make junkie and I had many foundations from drugstores and major department stores but as I got older they all made me look cake and settled into lines. I stumbled on this product and I love it. It's my skin only better. It lasts almost all day on my  combination oily dry skin. It is a wonderful product with light medium coverage for mature skin. Will definitely buy again * I've used 3 pots of this now and I'm still somehow surprised by how nice it is. The formula feels like it won't cover much, but it softens the appearance of/seems to fill and even out pores, scars, wrinkles, or any textures--I often get compliments on how smooth my skin looks when I use this. I've gone back and forth between two colors because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the color match is a little difficult. All in all, I keep trying new foundations just to come back to this one and be impressed by it. * I'm a light-medium skin tone that leans towards cool. I got started on this because an influencer raved about it a few yrs. ago. I decided to try it and couldn't had been more thrilled. I use shade fair 20 for reference. In the pot it looks more like a peach shade. It glides on effortlessly and melts into my skin. My dry/mature skin looks healthy. I'm sure I will get tired of this foundation, but for the last 3 yrs. I've been pleased. Only time will tell. * I was very skeptical to try this and was shocked. It is so good. 47 year old combo skin, apply with real techniques dense brush and its better than high end. How is this not more popular?"
145,hourglass,illusion hyaluronic skin tint,pimprod2020463,2575960," * I expected to love this based on reviews I'd seen, but for me, it applied very thick, sat noticeably in pores (an issue I've never had with any other product) and fine lines and didn't do anything it claims to do. I actually found it quite drying. I love HG products and am so glad Ulta is carrying them. I hope they'll carry the newer HG skin tint so I can try that one. * Im 55 and my skin is very dry, this product is moisturizing and never settles in my pores , an excellent alternative to foundation which just sat on my skin, this tinted moisturizer does not do that. I would highly recommend this product- * I have never had so many compliments about my skin since using this tinted moisturizer! It may not be for anyone needing full coverage makeup but someone looking for a glow and slight coverage! * It was very hard to find something for my aging skin that is full coverage, but doesn't settle into lines and look caked on. this was recommended in store and I absolutely love it! I apply with a beauty blender and use shape tape concealer with a tiny bit of setting powder. Really makes a difference being hyaluronic and any pictures while wearing come out great. A must in my drawer. * I wanted to like this. I have dry skin and some creepiness at 52. This made all of that worse.

It's very thick and kinda hard to blend out even with moisturizer and primer. 
I had to return this and buy the Too Faced brand hydrating liquid foundation. * Several comments said this was medium to full coverage which made me want to try it and it is not. There is absolutely no coverage at all. If anything it's just a glorified moisturizer so I'm thinking those other comments were for a different product. * Absolutely one of my favorite foundation. I love how it leaves my skin glowing and hydrated!"
146,jane iredale,refillable compact,pimprod2031651,2595249," * Tried to purchase this compact in the 21 Days of Beauty promotional, but couldn't add it to my cart, was it sold out?  Imagine my surprise the following day when it was available again at full price. Bait and switch advertising...not cool. * The discontinued gold compact was perfectly thin and light weight, making it easy to carry everyday. Also great for touch-ups when mineral foundation SPF is needed out in the sun! The closing latch wasn't super secure but I never had a problem with it opening in my purse. The new design is thick and super heavy. It's beautiful to sit on a counter, but useless weight for travel or carried in a shoulder bag. So sad I never odered backs up of the slim gold-tone compact! * I was surprised how expensive this compact is. But I have had so many contacts break and then I get crumbled pressed powder. This one looks like it will hold up well. I will let you know the first time I drop it-Yikes! * Very happy with this new compact. My JI mineral foundation stores securely,  the compact opens easily and now has a mirror. Yay! * I am a loyal Jane Iredale brand user. In fact, I have been using their products for over 20 years. The Jane Iredale line was recommended to me by the surgeon who did facial reconstruction after skin cancer surgery. 

Although I love their products, I have always been ""ehh"" about their packaging....until now! Thanks for finally giving up the gaudy gold (sorry, Jane Iredale) and going with this new, modern and aesthetically pleasing line of packaging. Since I have several of the old gold compacts, including the gold metals ones, I ordered one of the new compacts to see how I would like it. After receiving the new compact, I cannot wait to replace ALL my older versions! 

One more suggestion... in your future development, please consider making your eye shadows available in refills. I love the idea of being kinder to our planet and saving on the excess packaging. I do not mind paying separately for the cases if I know if is making a smaller, greener impact for future generations. =)

One final note of thanks to Ulta...I have been begging my local store to start carrying Jane Iredale. I am glad to see that you are at least finally carrying this amazing, clean line of makeup online! * I bought this on sale and I'm glad I did. It just makes it nice to put your foundation in. For the price of the foundation, it's a shame you have to purchase compact separately. * This packaging is overpriced and by default should be included with the powder. Waste of money."
147,nudestix,tinted cover foundation,pimprod2008837,2552723," * Overall I really like this product. I have sensitive skin and eczema, but this does not irritate my skin. The only thing I dislike is the initial smell when first applied - it has a strange medicinal smell. The smell goes away 15-20 minutes after application but it's strong when first applied. If this product was truly fragrance free I would give it 5 stars. * I have been upping my skin care regiment to combat hormonal acne and hyperpigmentation so my skin has been looking very nice. Thats where this product shines! It's very hydrating and lightweight so it looks like radiant skin! * I actually love this foundation bc i have blemish free skin and us it to even out hyperpigmentation. The issue is the pump… it does not pull product well after tube is no longer full and it doesn't come off. So its just wasted product. * Of course it doesn't fully cover blemishes, its not full coverage. I buy this again & again & pair it with concealer for under eyes / blemishes , & blush. Its so smooth, never breaks out my acne prone skin. I love it so much!! * Honestly I hate foundation, I have super sensitive skin and anything can break me out easily. This foundation is SO NICE!! It is more like a skin tint than a foundation, which I prefer if I do ever wear it, the smell is relaxing (if you're not an essential oil person I wouldn't recommend, the lavender is pretty strong), and it doesn't feel like anything is on. For my Florida girls this stuff is a great quick fix for the hot and humid days!! * I have super sensitive, rosacea-prone skin & my eyes are really easily irritated by makeup (ocular rosace) that started a few years ago - suddenly I couldn't wear my favorite makeup without breaking out, & my eyes burning, bright red. I searched & finally found a brand specifically for rosacea-prone skin! So happy to be able to wear makeup again! Over the last year or so the formula clearly changed - I couldn't find a color match & then my eyes started to  burn again. Back to the search - finally found this - I love this foundation & the whole product line! It's light & looks great - as others have said, I look like myself, only better! It doesn't settle in my lines or pores, doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It does feel a bit oily / has a bit of shine. Also, Nude 3 is a perfect color match for me when it goes on, but it does darken a bit across the day so I'm going to try 2.5 & save 3 for the summer. Otherwise, highly recommend!! * I bought this foundation and love it.  I'm 47 years old with dry and pigmented skin from aging and I like light coverage products due to aging skin look more natural than full coverage foundation.  Very moisturizing.  I still set with loose powder and yes would buy this as long as nudestix still made this."

It looks like SKIN and the shade is perfect for my pale olive toned skin. I love this so much!!! * I was so impressed with the color matching. This matched perfectly. Unfortunately, it was pretty watery. After a lot of shaking, it seemed to dispense properly, but the formula is pretty thick. It dries almost instantly and makes blending difficult. I also felt that it emphasized fine lines and wrinkles on my very dry skin. * overall the wear of the foundation wasn't bad, but my skin was red and inflamed when I took it off and I don't typically have sensitive skin and this was the only thing different in my routine * I like this brand and what little of this foundation I put on my face went on smooth and dried well. but it smelled so awful I couldn't use it! I didn't see reviews that mentioned the smell so I'm wondering if I got an old/bad batch…which would also be concerning. Disappointed but returning this * I have a hard time finding foundation due to an olive undertone, with silver being a better jewelry color for me. I purchased the Fair Lady T1N and this just.. it's awesome. It does dry down fast and blending becomes near impossible after, but with my combo skin, this is wonderful. I live in Maine and this foundation doesnt budge in the winter or the summer. One thing I will say is that if you have dry skin, this foundation won't be user-friendly. I typically have oil on my nose and forehead, with a dry chin. I lightly exfoliate my face, apply toner, then follow it up by a light non-cream moisturizer, and that solves the problem. * I was hoping this product would perform close to the Becca foundation that you can no longer get.
It's OK but not a go to foundation. It's more watery in my opinion and coverage has to be worked on quite a bit. 
I am sorry, but for me it's not what I was hoping for. * I dont teally wear foundation but gor aome reaaon wanted to try  this one and it was on sale . I am SO happy with it ! It wasnt heavy and it didnt cake up !  I am beyond happy"

I have oily skin but am on retinol so a light layer of this foundation works better than my other foundations. it can cake up if you use to many layers and don't prep correctly. I did wish they had a better shade range. * I have gone through 4 or 5 of this foundation! So easy to apply and sets beautifully with a setting spray * This is my favorite powder foundation formula and has been for years - goes on so smoothly and is buildable. The last few compacts I've bought have cracked from barely any use. I had to dump the powder into a different container and use it that way. * so I do a full face every day. every once in a while I'll ""cheat"" and use this product to save time. it works sooo well. I use a light shade which I chose by pretty much matching my neck/highlight areas and use it mainly in my T zone. highlighting under eyes, forehead between brows chin and then I also add it along my jawline. then I go about my routine as normal but without the need for foundation highlight and baking. saves so much time! it builds well and has amazing coverage. it lasts all day. I have mature skin and hate when things settle into fine lines and wrinkles and I do not have that problem with this. it actually makes my skin appear younger compared to my full face routine with baking etc. I know I hav to find a new foundation to help avoid it but who has the time lol anyway... YES. this product is one I want to hoard in case it ever goes away. it's amazing. I use it with a compact dense brush. 

only downside is that I broke 2... but it's because I throw it in my purse and I know that's not ideal and on me for being careless. but if it's getting tossed around, be aware the powder may break. * This is a must have in my kit! I use it to lightly set my foundation and it transforms my face! I have also used it as a powder foundation for summer days and it is flawless! * This is the best powder foundation i have ever tried, i reach for this one over my high end one.

I like that it is paraben free, affordable, has beautiful natural looking medium coverage, is hydrating, and actually has shades that match my medium yellowy-olive skin tone.
It looks like my bare skin but more even. I can't speak to the longevity because I don't really pay attention to that, haha. 
Yes it does totally smell like what you would paint your wall with! I'm willing to put up with it for an affordable paraben free option that actually matches my skin. * I love this and would buy it again... only a shade lighter. * Got this foundation about 2 weeks ago… just don't even look into this product.

This product is AMAZING. Literally just set it in my skin with a damp beauty blender and feel like just this and mascara can take me through the day. Literally just use it on its own and it looks amazing. No primer, no setting spray etc. Definitely try! * In fairness, I have used only loose powders for over 15 years- so I am used to a more sheer look. I typically love Dior products and the reviews made me think it could work. Definitely not for me. I am in my early 40's and this set right into every wrinkle on my face and just looked flaky.

This is super light - ""your skin but better"" kind of product which is exactly what I go for when I do my makeup. It gives you a fresh look with a dewy finish but not overly shiny. I was able to find the perfect shade which is super exciting. Seems that most brands tend to offer a lot of cool and warm tones but not many neutral options. Shade # 313 was a great match! * Moisturize well but it's beautiful. Covers redness, sun spots. Pretty impressive for drugstore! * sigh * I fell in love with this tint. I have tried so many from Ulta, from the drugstores and I will tell you ... it's exactly what it reads.... it's a SERUM with Tint ! Not a tint with serum !! big difference. This product is more skin than makeup. Get it !! * At first I liked this tint, but the more I used it I noticed how streaky, oily, and cakey it looks. I have dry skin but it's so sticky no matter how much I set it with powder. Also, there's literally no coverage. Obviously it's a skin tint but there should at least be some coverage. It also burns a little as others have stated. * After trying many skin tints, I came back to this one. With maturing skin, it instantly evens skin tone and leaves a youthful glow. It works well with powders and creams. It doesn't settle into any fine lines and feels so light weight. I barely feel like I have anything on my face. This has turned into my favorite foundation especially just in time for summer! * Seems to give a healthier glow!"

And the absolute best thing is that it keeps my skin looking fresh and dewey the entire day. * I picked this up from ULTA (In store) beauty at 90% off and  just ordered 3 more.  I love everything about this foundation.  I mostly love the dewy finish."
156,covergirl,trublend matte made liquid foundation,pimprod2000386,2533518," * I use the foundation daily and I would definitely recommend to someone who's on a tight budget. only thing is it is easily transferable and doesn't stay on variable. It also looks a bit cakey but i highly recomend spraying do we setting spray onto your brush/sponge, and then blending out. * I normally wear Estee stay matte foundation but I was out and until it arrived I needed something in the meantime. I wore this out, was standing in the parking lot talking to my friends and some random lady walked up to us and said ""sorry to interupt but I just have to tell you, you are stunning"" ( she was talking to me) And then she walked off. I was never told that when I wore the Estee! What the heck, this stuff is GOLD. * I have been using this foundation for 5 years now. I will say it is not full coverage but it is buildable. This foundation feels so lightweight & it gives such a natural look. I've tried other foundations but always come back to this one cause its just so good! I tend to have an oily T-zone & everywhere else is pretty much dry but this foundation doesn't ever really cake or flake on me. I 100% recommend this foundation for an everyday natural look! * I love this foundation! it's affordable and stays on all throughout the work day * this foundation is surprisingly good for the price. it's buildable, smooth, and has a nice matte but natural finish. it flaked on my chin area after a few hours, but that could be my skin type. * Love this for my combo skin. I'm not extremely oily but I needed something that would actually last throughout the day without needing to powder by midday. I actually like it better than the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I am shade 090 in Lancome but have not been able to find a good color match as 090 is too light and the next shades are too dark and orange. I have very fair neutral skin. I prefer how the covergirl looks, it is very smooth with slightly better coverage, and L20 is a great shade and a closer match than the Lancome (maybe L20 is a dash too light but it looks perfect after bronzer). It gives a natural matte finish that doesn't cling or look cakey. Works well on my middle-age skin with fine lines. Has great medium-full coverage. Highly recommend! * I really love this foundation and I will continue to purchase it! Affordable and covers well."

159,essence,keep me covered long-lasting foundation,pimprod2037417,2603112," * i discovered this foundation a few years ago mainly because it was super cheap. turns out the price is pretty self explanitory because this foundation should be named ""keep her covered in some places but not others"" its super patchy. it could work in a pinch though. i mainly use it for photo shoots since its cheap and i can always buy more. the patchiness isn't very visible on camera which is why i do that. but as long as i'm alive that will never be on my face in public. * Good product & price. * I wish I was being dramatic because I really like the formula and how light it feels on my face, the one I got is my perfect natural shade when first applied. but when it dried down. tell me why I was literally orange?!? and I thought maybe oh I could've gotten the wrong shade. (second guessing myself) I went a sister shade lighter and It was a little less noticeable but it still made me yellowish orange so I mixed it with a different foundation to see what would happen and it fixed the issue for me but for those that wanna know by itself it shifts color when dry but it's still a light smooth waterproof formula.. 
might I add,  what might not work for me might work better for you, it's always best to mess around and find out * This is honestly a really good sheer foundation. Its not full coverage but percect for the summer needing something lightweight. Shade match was surprising good. I would definitely buy again * Not good. Coverage is pretty bad. Watery. Dont buy * Great product * Great for the price but doesn't stay all day but the shades are great they just need more for other skin tones."

161,e.l.f. cosmetics,camo powder foundation,pimprod2030787,2597461," * This is such a beautiful powder, it is very versatile. It has a buildable, medium to full coverage, leaning on the side of full. It feels extremely velvety. It is matte without being drying, which is also hard to do without talc. Hoping that they bring this back. You can use it as a powder foundation and a tinted setting powder. There is something spectacular about this formula. Really hope Elf brings this back. * After seeing many amazing reviews, I came here, excited to try this. But sooo much disappointed when there is no shade available for me, not even a close shade. * So overall if say its a good product if your a oily skin and combination skin then its pretty good buttt the shade range needs work it goes from a fair skin shade to a tan walnut color so id say maybe add more shadess ! BUT I DO LOVE HOW THEY INCLUDED DEEPER SKIN TONES * This works so well for my skin when I want to beaty ""filter"" my face. But this is noy for dry skin. * It broke the second I tapped my brush on it. Then it was impossible to blend out on my face and ruined my makeup ): * I love this powder this is the best powder that I have discovered as of lately. Elf kills it with all the products they release but this is top tier. * I really wanted to like this product, but even though I moisturize my skin, it leaves randow streaks on my face, as if i applied it with a paint brush. And leaves weird marks on my nose that I cant blend out and have to literally use my nails to scratch off. I have oily skin and never experienced this with a powder foundation."

It's pure white and awful. * Smelled horrible right out of the tube.  Bought just to mess around and imediately threw away.  Would not recomend to anyone, ever. * I bought this for a lighter highlight effect. It's to thick and cakes hard to blend. * This is ultimately is not bad for the price but the shade I got dud not match the screen I ordered it from so.... and honestly makes you have texture really badly. But it is great if you use it for concealer instead. * Bought on clearance just to mess around.  (Three shades so I could try contours.). Smells too terrible to even do that.  I have never theown away makeup I just bought before this.  I know it is on clearance but it should not be sold at all. * I loveeeeeeee this foundation! It gives me the full coversge that i need * there is a reason this was so cheap"
163,kiko milano,full coverage 2-in-1 foundation & concealer,pimprod2020414,2576034," * I love Kiko. I live in Italy and was introduced to this brand by one of my girlfriends.All of their stuff is amazing. This foundation is great but definitely runs a bit warmer than I expected. I'm usually light neutral or 35N and grabbed shade 30N, it was darker than expected and waaaay too yellow on me. * I love this foundation * I was hesitant at first ,because I just heard from this brand but I'm glad i gave it a try. And it was on sale 😁 felt good on my face. I used it and yes it was worth it the staying power  was good specially of your from az. * Have a hard time matching foundation to my skin tone and this matches me perfectly. It looks natural and has buildable coverage. For the price, you cannot beat it, I own foundations double the price and this is now my go to. Give it a shot. :D * I bought this like a month ago and I love it! You dont have to use a lot and literally your face is flawless. One of the things i love about this product is it doesnt dry out your skin. I got the shade neutral 25 and id say that its a mix of fair and tan. I also really love the application part of it, the wand is really nice!!! * Covers a lot without having to apply a ton. Love the application wand * I love this foundation I find myself reaching for it more  often than the others. it's not drying, not greasy,  the coverage looks like my skin but glowy, and not cakey. The kiko Milano powder is awesome too for baking BTW. This foundation is way very similar to TF Born this way foundation, (but not as greasy) kiko milano is underrated IMO. Yes I would recommend."
164,well people,bio stick foundation,pimprod2008575,2553269," * The old formula truly was the best, I looked forward to applying it every morning.  Blended like a dream, gorgeous satin finish, blurred imperfections, clean and fragrance free.  The color 1C was actually a cool tone, this new 1C is PEACH toned....very warm, and the formula change truly makes me sad....it's not the same. They ruined a perfect product. * I absolutely love this product! The smell is a bit strong and the application is a little off-putting, but it blends great and looks great! I found that instead of using a traditional primer like elf power grip, using a setting spray to prime made application easier and blending smoother. * My skin looked worse with this. Highlighying pores no matter how much or how many different methods i use. And shows every bump, dry patch, etc. its so weird. Like the opposite of why we wear makeup in the first place. So mad i was fooled that im writing a review * I have very fair and pink skin and have always had trouble finding foundations that match my tone, never mind work well on my oily/combination skin, but I will say that this one does a good job! I was nervous buying online without match testing, but I got the 1C and would say its a pretty good match for my skin tone. 

My pros for this are definitely: generaly matches my skin, works well with my oily/combination skin, it coming in a stick format is very convenient and mess free, stays on very well, looks natural, and doesnt make my skin feel gross

My cons would be: not the perfect match (wish the undertones were more p and that the shade was slightly lighter), can get a little cakey if i put too much on, and a little hard to blend. 

For context I've been wearing Too Faced Born this way foundation in the shade Snow for years now because it's the only foundation I've found that comes close to matching my skin, but I've always run into the same problem of not being able to apply the foundation too thick because then you can tell it's not a true match. Anyway, I would say overall thi one does a better job, has better ingredients, feels better on my skin, and is a good price point.

My last points would be dont let the 1 star reviews scare you, this foundation is very nice and as long as you use a wet sponge to apply and don't mind the mild scent of castor oil that fades in about 30 minutes :) * The old formula was amazing.  Shade 1C was a perfect cool tone as described.  This newer version is very peach in tone and no longer qualifies as cool toned.  So  if you are a fair, cool toned person...look elsewhere. * I have come back to this product again and again after trying other hydrating foundations that are too thin and messy or settle into pores. This is my favorite non-SPF foundation. It is like a natural version of cover girl compact makeup. It's vegetable oil based so it does smell like olive oil. But it's so nourishing and convenient with the solid stick. It smooths on well to a medium coverage and natural dewy finish that doesn't settle into my pores or cause breakouts for me. And with a light powder to set, it stays all day. I do wish they had lighter shades as the lightest warm (2W) is a bit dark for me in winter. But I'm a repeat customer of this good clean dry skin foundation option. * This brand is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I live in the desert and ingredients like hyaluronic acid just pull the water out of your skin because there's no water in the air here. It seemed like every make up and skincare brand hopped on that train and I couldn't find anything for my skin (dry) and climate type. I hope they never change the formula! I'm almost 30 and I'm starting to get crows ft etc and this really does a great job of camouflage without settling in any wrinkles."

 There's no Comparison... bring this back * I need this to come back!!! I haven't found anything that i really like. * I bought this product for many years and I always loved it. However since Kat sold the product off its formula has changed for the worse. I've tried the new version and it's awful I've tried fenti, tarte, double wear, and two others they all suck! * Mine always smelled like paint. Super thick, matte and cakey but superior coverage to anything made ever. * Please bring it back!!!! Nothing compares * My favorite and un replaceable foundation. I haven't found a similar to this one not one!!! This is the best foundation for OILY skin and tge coverage amazing. Loved that it last all day mind you i live in Az and the weather is HOT this foundation would not move at all. Pleas eplease being this back because Good Apple is not close at all in coverage and wear. * This was the only matte foundation i found that made my textred mature skin not look more textured and makes me look older like all other matte foundations I've tried! This one looks so amazing. Stayed all day and i sweat alot on my face. I really dont know why they got rid of this foundation. I literally have not one bad thing to say about this foundation. I really hope they bring this back!!!"
169,lorac,pro soft focus longwear foundation,pimprod2013331,2558415," * I don't like to leave bad reviews, but this foundation was a disappointment for me as I love, LOVE their glass primer. First is that it came out very watery. I understand it is buildable but this was really runny. As others have said, it has a faint maple syrup smell - but for me it was maple syrup mixed with chemical. I am also having some kind of skin reaction and irritation since using this. Nothing major, but enough for me to not use it anymore after 2 uses. Lastly it did not last more than 4 hours. It smeared, creased and caked in areas on my face. Luckily I bought this on sale and just gave it to my niece. This might work for others but for me - no. Sadly their foundation does not live up to the quality of their glass primer - which for me is the best primer in all my years. * I was amazed at how full coverage it is! & how it dosent even look like im wearing foundation! I mean wow !! Definetly will be purchasing more! * I never had a Lorac foundation before, but I know the brand revamped so I thought I would give this a try. It did not dissapoint!!! I have roseacea and dry skin, and this worked amazing for coverage. There is a small scent but it's sweet and lowkey reminds my of syrup. Besides that there are no complaints from me. I would highly recommend using the shade finder tool to compare it to your current foundation. I'm an olive skin tone so it's hard to find foundations that are inclusive of that. I got a summer shade and a winter shade because  I love this foundation so much. Highly recommend! * I don't know if this is supposed to be runny as only a few reviews mentioned it but it's basically colored water & it's so messy. I will never buy this again. * This is my new favorite foundation,
! It has excellent coverage with a natural finish. I have dry skin but find a lot of the hydrating foundations transfer and/or leave my skin looking oily by the end of the day, this foundation looks good all day and doesn't transfer. It does have a incredibly potent smell that lingers long after it dries, but I have been able to get used to it and I only notice when during application. * Although I like this foundation in everyway I have to give a low score because it isn't CRUELTY FREE.   There is no good reason for testing on animals and there are plenty of good products available which ARE CRUELTY FREE too. * I purchased this on a whim as i saw it on sale. I received it at the same time another package with the new Prada foundation came in, and I'm shocked that i like the Lorac foundation more than the Prada!  I applied this with my Hourglass foundation brush as the formula is quite thin amd it went on beautifully. Its so smooth and the finish really is a soft matte. It seems to be very long lasting as well. My first favorite foundation of the year."
170,kiko milano,active foundation,pimprod2036981,2607365," * Ok, there are a lot of decent stick foundations out now (not great, but decent).  I don't think this is one of them.  It's the old school sort--the kind that feels very waxy.  If you have dry skin, you will not be pleased.  It's very hard to get the finish to look good, and even harder to get it to stay looking good.  It's probably not going to save you time or make your life easier on the go. * I am blown away by how amazing this stick foundation is!! It gives a barely there feeling which i love. It does not settle into fine lines and stays on all day. Can't wait to try more stuff from the brand!!! * This stick goes on sooo smoothly! Absolutely love the consistency of this makeup! My skin looked like a barely there makeup look, exactly what i was going for. Definitely need to extend the shade range of this makeup but other than that this stuff is amazing!! * great coverage for my skin tone and felt smooth.  please add more skin tones so all people can have it. * this shade range has every type of tone for lighter skin but for 1 dark complexion do better * I honestly dont unserstand why people who've never tried this give it a low rating due to the shade range. This is an Italian owned brand. Majority of the population is olive, light to medium skintones. Many of them/us have a hard time finding our shades. Go try Fenty Beauty if you dont like it. Anyways, this is fantastic. Super blendable and looks smooth on my texture. * the shade range is disgusting. its not like italy is a sheltered country or anything, many POC reside there. darker women, men, and all in between deserve to have products that fit their skin too. do better."
171,maybelline,instant age rewind perfector 4-in-1 whipped matte makeup,pimprod2028923,2590459," * Its like it never dries and doesnt stick to your skin. So skin ends up looking splotchy. Wipes off easily and blends with nothing. Won't purchase again! * I have combination skin, super oily with dry patches. I hate the feeling of foundation so I just prefer something super light to even out my color and mattify me. This stuff is perfect! It feels completely weightless and looks natural. It wears off gradually by the end of the day without looking crazy. Definitely my favorite face makeup! * It wiped off easily didn't  stay on my face. I would use it in a certain spot and i would try and apply it somewhere else and it would wipe off * As for color match, it's perfect. But it doesn't really cover up my imperfections like age spots * Looks great on my skin. * Very light coverage. Feels so light and soft on skin. Not oily after a full day of wear! Doesn't cover blemishes the best but will give a nice even tone over the skin. Blends nicely! * I loved this! Its very light weight. I used under this my normal skin car rountine. And i wear elf glow sunscreen and halo glow with this bb cream and i loved the result. I do use conceler as well. And i dont feel caked on. Honestly try this method."
172,flower beauty,get real serum foundation,pimprod2022967,2577491," * Pretty good coverage for a serum foundation, very dewy, very smoothing over texture. Hides my pores, my skin drinks this up. It doesnt settle into fine lines over time like alot of foundations do on me, I have dry skin. I dont know how this would hold up on oily skin, but its great for dry skin! Almost seems soothing for my skin, as it makes my skin very soft when I take it off, has been good for my acne as well. Good on dry spots and excema around my eyes!  Will probably need to set with powder as it is very dewy, but it looks amazing with powder too. Mixes well with other products. Only con is the shade range, not grear for pale girlies * Light coverage, runny. * I had the worst luck with ordering this both  times the  foundation bottle was broken and leaking everywhere also they should've put it in a cardboard box instead of a mailer envelope ,it was an absolute mess that I had to ask for a refund. * I wanted to like this but its sooooo oily right from the start. When I put it on it was very sheer and its not really something I can build up. Also it literally wipes off so there is that. * So good 😊 such good coverage only thing that I didn't like about it was that it was thick. * I am someone who likes a no-makeup look, and this is perfect! The product is very hydrating and goes on in a nice thin coat to make you look flawless and like you don't have makeup on. Unsure if it's buildable since I didn't try. Highly recommend! * I absolutely love this foundation! It is even better then the very high end products i have purchased.  Hydrated, natural looking skin is what my aging skin looks like when using it. I cannot believe what an absolute bargain this foundation is. I would gladly pay triple the price. I hope they never stop making it!"

It is so thick it won't pump out. The foundation is clumpy and doesn't spread at all. Why did they change a good product???? * This foundation is worth trying! Creamy, spreads nicely (I use a brush), nice colour matching (I consider myself a medium brown skin colour). Overall great product! * I cannot say enough GOOD THINGS about this CC cream. There comes the point when foundation is out, and CC cream is in, and I am pleased with this product's color choices, smooth texture, and luminescence. I mix two shades and apply the first color as a primer. This CC cream doubles as my concealer; it's that easy to apply. * This product: separates BADLY and doe not blend well at all; Smells weird and chemical-y; offers VERY little coverage, even for a CC cream, and is overpriced because of all these factors. Positives: it makes skin glowy and has SPF. I wouldn't buy this personally - Pacifica's skincare and fragrance are AMAZING, but makeup seems to be a weak point. * This product came out separated. Tried shaking product to get product mixed together and it came out somewhat like foundation. Does not go on skin nicely. Do not recommend. * it comes out as a clear oil with little specs of color that don't blend."

Please please PLEASE bring back some of the lighter colors. * I bought this over the holidays and LOVED it!! Goes on easily and is weightless. Soooo disappointed to see that my shade is not available. Please do not discontinue this product. * My perfect shade is Light to Medium Cool.  Not available the last 2 times I've tried to buy.

I was not expecting to fall in love with this product, but it's truly flawless. I have NEVER had a shade match me so accurately. This product is buildable and can be worn for 100% full coverage or as a tint. The color is pigmented enough to cover dark undereye without concealer for a very natural ""no makeup"" finish. The price is a steal lol * I have never had a more perfect color match in my entire life. I show this to the older women in my family and you would think I was literally doing a magic trick lol shock awe and wonder. I often and loudly recommend this in True Caramel. Perfect for lace on wigs or just on skin * The foundation is very smooth and moisturizing.  It provides medium coverage, so I build it by applying several applications to get a more full coverage.  It is a great product for the price. * I have purchased this product before and I liked it. This time the product was used. It had a finger smudge print on it when l opened it and the sponge applicator had make all on one side. I ended up purchasing something else at another store. * First, note this has the ingredients that Danessa Myricks uses for her foundation at an affordable cost. This provides a great shade match, makes skin look healthy and even, easy to take with you and stays on even if you sweat. The magnesium carbonate in the formula absolutely is wonderful for sweaty moments. I just find you can't really apply it with anything other than a sponge. Brushes with dense round tops don't pick it up well, as nothing else does. If you don't want to buy a beauty sponge you'll be fine to use the one it comes with. * Great shade for Hispanic women."
176,essence,keep me covered powder,pimprod2043728,2618266," * This is a solid foundation. The key is to prep your skin first.

Test with primer to see which works well with it. 
I found this super easy to use and just faster than liquid foundation. I like it with Wet n Wild Glass Correct in green underneath over redness first. I also used a makeup setting spray after. 
I'm bummed it has poor reviews from people misusing it and that there's no light cool shades left. I just came back to buy another 2:( 
If you see it in store grab it for FOUNDATION,  it's good! * i absolutely love essence, but this is just not it. i wore this to school one time, and my face looked so white and flaky, and very cakey. you can tell the product is cheap, and that's not good. * I love this powder! On top of liquid foundation of course. It gives your foundation that extra boost and smooths out your skin even more. I have Extremely oily skin, I'm talking about im already getting oily an hour after I put my makeup on and this powder does not separate. I even use it to touch up my makeup and makes my skin look smooth and fresh and doesn't cake. best powder I ever used, works just as good as the Mac studio fix plus powder in my opinion. Get it! * The power broke during shipping. And it makes gou look evey ghostly. It ashes out anytning you have on your face * I have used this several times and it's important to remember this is a powder foundation, not a setting powder. it's fantastic when used over moisturizer and primer. also great for touch ups. it definitely looks cakey when not used as described. * This will seperate your makeup, does not look good on almost any skintone, ashy, cakey, and its extremely hard to open."

Isnt all foundation tinted""? Maybe try tinted moisturizer * Light and hydrating product that evens out dull skin without looking heavy! Great for looking put together on minimal makeup days. * The coverage of this bad boy is wat too light to be called a foundation, but it doesnt have any skin care benefits which is I guess why they can't call it BB cream. It's refreshing to have a product with light coverage and a natural finish instead of dewy. Great for no makeup makeup days. * I found the Tawny shade of L.A. Girl Tinted Foundation in my local Ulta's clearance section and figured I'd give it a try. When I got home, I used Ulta's shade matcher and it told me I was really Warm Sand in this product (based off entering Ginger for bareMineral's COMPLEXION RESCUE Tinted Moisturizer Mineral SPF 30). Warm Sand perfectly matches my skin right now during the winter. I'll try Tawny again in the spring/summer, but it was a close match too. I love how lightweight this product feels and how easy it is to apply — I dot it on right from the tube and the dab/blend with a lightly moist makeup sponge. It looks just slightly dewy but doesn't feel overly wet or sticky. It also works well under my bareMinerals BAREPRO 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation if I want to look more made up, but between the price and its natural look when used solo, it fits well with my minimalist approach to makeup. * I am 66 years old. It settled into my wrinkles and emphasized them.  Very sheer coverage. Not a good choice for me."
179,well people,bio powder foundation,pimprod2008579,2553264," * Light, sheer. Shade range is confusing. If unsure, go a bit darker than normal. * I ordered 2W - Warm light - and it was almost white, so light and clearly defective. It did absolutely nothing other than make me have a Casper look. It is so sheer I can't imagine it doing anything even if it was the correct color.  I contacted Well People, I thought they should know how bad the product was, and they didn't care. * W3ll people... we need to talk about the shade range. People with darker skin tones like makeup too yet the shade range completely excludes anyone beyond tan. Thankfully the darkest shade works for me so I enjoy the product but it's hard to get behind a brand that doesn't give darker skintones a thought. * I was really hoping this product would work for me but it didn't. I found the baked foundation to be much more drying than other pressed powders I've previously used. Felt like it didn't go on well and had horrible coverage. Will not be buying again. * Takes forever to build up. Not for anyone who wants medium to full coverage. Light to medium at best. * Honestly if you're looking for a foundation to take a chance on.. this is definitely it. I'm not sure why I even chose to buy this but I love it!! I use it over concealer and it evens out my skin tone perfectly. Also does not make me look too orangey or cakey. * Just meh"

I do recommend this. * this product is horrible. it doesn't blend at all and it's extremely patchy and cakes on easily. there are cheaper foundations that are better than this!

183,mented cosmetics,skin by mented foundation,pimprod2022002,2578536," * I saw mented today and bought m10, d10, t30(like 2 of each) I did this with complexion changes and such in mind. It was so easy to apply, felt nice on my skin, looks natural and I think m10 is my shade - it is spot on (for my beautiful summer complexion ) I'm excited to have found Mented! not a con for me, because i don't choose a makeup to smell good, but definitely seems like fragrance wasn't added.

I have pretty dry sky so I know to add a moisturizer before applying this. I am not saying this drying…but makeup ondry skin can appear patchy * This product feels and looks like you have no product on. * I have searched for the perfect match years! So excited to have finally found a shade so spot on with my skin tone that it's almost scary. The stick foundation is easy to apply, blends well and leaves me a great natural glow. * Looked awful on me. Horrible on oily skin and def dont get if you have light skin. This foundation isnt made for light skin tones which sucks. * Perfect match almost feels like a tinted moisturizer. I'm oily so I still need a powder but for stick makeup it goes on smooth and doesn't run off. I'm sold * Okay so hear me out.. the color match to my skin is amazing!!! it blended beautifully. However, I have combo oily skin and nothing could have prepared me for how shiny and oily this foundation is. This is not a matte foundation so beware!! * Hidden Gem hands down. I have been looking for a good foundation in general for a few years now, I went high end low end drugstore I went tinted moisturizer to full coverage and non did what I actually wanted. I love make up but finding a good foundation for my oily skin that wont force me to re touch (which I'm horrible at by the way, always makes it worse) was close to impossible without making me feel like I have pounds of make up on especially for work. I had tried the Hourglass foundation stick which was highly rated and felt very chalky on my skin. I did a search of stick foundations and came across this one. I am the lightest shade in this line and am on my way to re up for a 3rd time! I have never purchased 1 item more than once since they end up not working out for a while. The coverage is amazing from one layer to a 2 layers if I want a fuller look. It glides on like butter on my skin  and gives me a glow without an oily look if that makes sense. I rarely have to completely set my face because it sets so nice on its own and will literally last me over 9 hours without any cracks or separation and looks like I just applied it minutes ago. It makes my face feel hydrated and not like I'm wearing loads of make up. This is a long review and I never leave a review but I am truly in love with this foundation! I am so thankful for this brand because I am the in between when it comes to make up, I'm a semy fare complexion with neutral undertones. Many lines have a Yellow undertone or an olive undertone which makes me look washed out. This is truly a bang for your buck and will leave your make up looking flawless."

185,mac,studio radiance face and body radiant sheer foundation,pimprod2023387,2579193," * wow. I can go on about this foundation forever. I have very pale, dry skin, this shade range cancels out any issues ive had with light foundations that are too orange, does not stick to or emphasize when i have dryness. I 100% recommend this product. * This doesn't settle in wrinkles like a lot of foundation.  It is a bit hard to use to start with but once you figure it out it's very nice.  Good for older and younger skin.  I'm 64 and it's the best I've ever used. * This foundation is perfect for evening out skin tone without making it look like you painted your make up on. I really love pairing it with cream contour and cream blush, and then just setting it with a setting spray- it gives a gorgeous dewy finish. You can set it with powder to make it a little more long lasting too. I always try to catch it on sale. I think having a gorgeous light coverage foundation like this is perfect for an interview, meeting someone new, or embracing your natural beauty! Its made me feel so much more confident in my own skin. * The origin to my villain story. I listened to an ULTA employee, first foundation for my high school homecoming. Three days later I broke out, having clear skin all my life. Ever since, it never stopped. I had to go on meds to cure my acne. Don't use. * I used to use the old face and body without the radiance and always loved it so im not surprised I love the new version especially because I like more of a sheen/glow to my skin. This is a very sheer coverage foundation but is buildable if you want a little more coverage. Also I can apply this over my skincare without it pilling! * I never tried the original face and body. Honestly, I was never interested in this foundation until I started watching Miss Megan Robinson on tik tok. Seriously you NEED to follow her!! I generally have oily skin. It's been a lot more calm, and a lot less oily after I got rid of all the actives, and JUST started washing, toning, and using AN OIL (I know right, but it's true, oil loves oil, using an oil will keep your skin from producing a lot of oil) I can now wear this foundation confidently, and it is BEAUTIFUL!! It's friction activated so I suggest applying with fingers and rubbing it in so you can start to feel the ""gripping and thickening"" action that happens with this foundation(which is the best most fun part for me). The coverage is obviously light but it looks like perfected skin. Only the best things are peeking through. Everything blends nicely on top, and I mean EVERYTHING, from all different brands. It wears great too and looks even better as the day goes on. Its softly radiant and skin like if you powder (which I still do) and if you don't you'll look like a freshly hot glazed donut (some people like that, some people don't) I get the hype of this foundation and dare I say it's made it into my top 5 line up!!?? Coming from an oily girl that is shocking. If you're wondering, I use the Danessa Myricks yummy skin balm in translucent as a primer, this foundation, all my other creams and liquids, and I set with Mac studio fix powder and one size setting spray. PERFECTED NATURAL RADIANT SKIN * Wear it everyday and have received unprovoked complements."
186,vdl,perfect lasting foundation,pimprod2006000,2560248," * I LOVE this foundation! It's definitely full coverage. It look so beautiful like natural skin! It doesn't dry matte, so definitely set it with powder. I'd say a little goes a long way! It last all day & still look beautiful even after a workout. The only areas that would slightly crease would be around my smile lines & chin but nothing crazy. I wish the foundation would be more available but it's so hard to find & the shade range isn't the best but overall 10/10 I would recommend! My closest shade is A05.5. I also tried mixing V05 & V04 to get my shade if anyone is wondering. I hope this helps.  :) * Coming from an Ulta Employee, after trying every foundation under the sun, this foundation makes my skin look FLAWLESS, airbrushed, smooth. I do have to set with a translucent loose powder because it is still a little tacky in my opinion. Shades are FANTASTIC. A02 matches me the closest; however if there was a slightly paler shade with a yellow undertone that would be my perfect match. I ordered A01 and A02 on YesStyle and to me 1 was almost darker than 2, but it may just be the undertones. ULTA PLEASE BRING THIS BACK. It took me over a week with express shipping on YS btw I paid $19 extra FYI In case anyone was going to order it, I think it ships from China. Idk what is in this foundation but  I want to buy every bottle just incase it ever gets discontinued😅😭😭😭 * My relationship with foundation is a nightmare,I'm a brown skin girl with golden undertones in the summer and pale skin in the winter,without much prep this foundation matched me perfectly and stayed on ALL NIGHT,the a night of dancing 💕LOVE THIS STUFF * Please restock ASAP! This is my favorite foundation!! I literally bought 3 bottles because I have a feeling Ulta might discontinue this foundation...
 FYI- you can still find VDL on Yesstyle BUT it's NOT the same foundation. The one on Yesstyle has SPF & it has more of a dewy finish 😩 * I hope Ulta is not going to stop selling this foundation. It is an amazing satin finish foundation. Looks flawless on the skin and makes blemished skin look smooth. Wears beautifully throughout the day and is full coverage. Highly recommend. FYI if they stop selling it at Ulta you can find it on YesStyle. * I bought this foundation in the color A06. I tend to have a hard time finding foundations because I am in the weird shade range where I'm typically between medium/tan and dark/deep in various brands. I have Neutral slightly golden/olive undertones and find that many brands get close but not perfectly my shade. Most times foundations are too golden (almost orange looking), too cool, exactly neutral when I need just a touch of yellow in the foundation, or they just skip my shade altogether. I was pleasantly surprised when this foundation was an exact match. I love the natural finish to this foundation. I have dehydrated combo skin that if not properly hydrated will get oily in the t-zone (mostly nose area) and will remain normal or slightly dry everywhere else. When I wear this for several hours my foundation goes from very natural to radiant but not oily as my t-zone starts to break into a bit of a shine. I really don't have anything bad to say about this foundation except because of the limited shade range there's a chance you may not find a good match depending on your skin tone and undertone. Hopefully Ulta continues to keep this foundation available. * I would describe this foundation on my skin as full coverage with a satin/slight dewy finish. I have acne prone skin with acne scars and this foundation covers everything without causing any texture. Long wearing and mask proof. Doesn't cause breakouts. Would recommend for various skin types."
187,l'orÃ©al,age perfect creamy powder foundation,pimprod2021675,2569747," * Very light, silky powder texture. The ""creamy"" title is very deceiving though. It's powder. And quite drying immediately on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this for aging skin whatsoever. Great product for on the go touch ups on oily skin. * I don't care for the sponge applicator because it really doesn't go on right, but I found that using a brush to apply is so much better and it goes on more evenly.  You can add more where needed without it looking blotchy.  I love it! Used the color Sienna * Goes smooth and cover some imperfections, but looks natural. Leaves your skin soft and beautiful. * Lightest shade, Ivory.  You MUST prep the skin with moisturizer, sunscreen and either CT Hollywood Flawless Filter or the Maybeline knockoff or a dewy primer or sunscreen.  Buff in with a brush after applying concealer where needed.  Use powder bronzer, blush and highlight and a setting spray.  It looked amazing on my 48 year old dry skin and lasted all day.  Not powdery, didn't settle in lines, let's your skin peek through (is light coverage).   I really love it. * I thought since it's called age perfect it would be a moisturizing creamy powder. Nope. It's super drying and I have combination oily skin not even dry. Feels horrible right on application You can feel the makeup. Didn't blur anything. I had to take it off within 10 mins of application. Don't buy this stuff. * I wanted to try a cream to powder foundation to try to cover some dark spots. 
This covered what I wanted. It does look a little dry after application but I'm oily so it looks more natural after a few hours. * I love the age rewind concealer and seen this after looking for a good powder foundation. it is a really creamy, finely milled powder. I don't think it's really pigmented but you get enough coverage to even everything out and in my opinion it really does blur. I use a flat top Kabuki brush to buff it in, slowly building up layers. I take product and tap it in where I need more coverage with a concealer brush. I find I get the most coverage this way. it's like your skin but better. gives you a nice natural finish and doesn't look cakey if you slowly buff and build. will be trying this as a setting powder for liquid since it blurs. it also doesn't make me breakout!"
188,hynt beauty,encore pressed powder foundation,pimprod2014352,2564466," * I was so excited to try this powder because of all of the positive reviews. Unfortunately, This product didn't work for my dry skin. And for the price I doesn't have great coverage. I don't see this product any different from any other pressed powder. Also, this powder has sparkles in it I guess to conceal how drying and powdery it makes the skin.. * I love this powder, my skin is dry but this powder always feels comfortable on, never adds any texture as other powders have for me in the past, def one of my fav powders * I LOVE this pressed powder! It takes away the look of shine and makes my skin look refined and even toned. I bought Ivory and it is the ideal shade for my skin tone, medium fair with pink undertones. It works well worn over concealer and foundation, or on its own. And, better still, it looks invisible and feels like nothing on skin! The mirrored compact is the perfect size for taking on the go and it even comes with an applicator sponge on a clear, hinged divider inside. Hynt thought of everything with this pressed powder! I will definitely buy again:) * I've always been reluctant to wear powder - most of the time I end up looking cake-y. This finishing powder is a game changer - so easy to apply and bonus, the packaging is so adorable! But more importantly my skin looks so velvety and super plump, definitely will be coming back for more when I'm through with this! * Love using this powder in-between zoom meetings to touch up my skin. Just gives me a more even/finished and natural look * One of my favorite products from Hynt * I used this foundation with the foam puff it came packaged with. Do not use with a brush, the powder is finely milled and will fall off your brush! I wore it over serum and moisturizer. My face got a little shiny throughout the day but that is common for me, as I have combination skin. I like that the coverage is buildable, I was able to apply two layers and achieved the coverage I was looking for. Best of all, the ingredients are natural and truly clean! No SLS, no parabens, no Lauryl Lysine, no Bismuth oxychloride! So happy Ulta is carrying this brand!"
189,hourglass,vanish seamless finish liquid foundation,pimprod2020422,2575785," * For a pro makeup artist, ( yes, you need to be a pro to know how to work with it) this is so far one of the best foundations that I have ever worked with. I recommend performing a gentle face exfolation before bed time and removing any peach fuzz for any makeup aplication, not just this foundation. It makes a huge difference in aplication and appearance of the final look/finish.
It works best with the Vanish smoothing primer. (To smooth down the pores that every human being has) It is runny but extreamly pigmented. Do not use too much or it will look cakey.Best apply with a dense buffer brush (Morphe 444 is my favorite) and then press it in with a beauty blender. I use the professional Kryolan setting spray first, and then set it with a good powder.( Jeffree Star, Fenty or Kryolan powder) It holds for 14h even in humid Florida. Best foundation for events. It's best for normal/ combination skin. I wish they had more shades.
Unfortunately it just has been discontinued, tho the company has gave me insites that they are working on perfecting the formula and making a new foundation for combination/oily skin (they currently carry luminous foundations for normal/dry skin) * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * This product is so thin & runny! Like water consistency. I pumped one pump on my hand & it literally dripped off me. I shook the bottle so many times & it still remained runny. I gave it a try on my face because I wanted to give the foundation a chance but the product just settled right into any crevice it could. I could literally see wrinkles/lines I didn't even know I had. * I got this during a sale and was so excited to try my first Hourglass product. I followed the instructions and reviews and only used a very little amount. It brings out my pores horribly, dries down very weird and makes my skin dry, and even though it feels light on my skin my skin feels a tiny bit sticky, not something I usually experience with prestige brand foundations. This is a miss for me. * This foundation is very reminiscent of Marc Jacob's 'Remarcable' . Full coverage and matte with a pore filling matte primer underneath . The bad reviews are really just people who don't know how to apply makeup . * Words do not explain how buttery this foundation is I have dry to normal skin and it blends it two to three glides. Will never use another foundation"
190,smashbox,studio skin 24 hour full coverage waterproof foundation,pimprod2009758,2552423," * Luckily I night this on a good sale a ways back but it is just not it. I have combo oily skin and so far regardless of the primer or moisturizer this just doesn't look good and will break down. I've been using juvias place which I like ten times better and I don't have to try to make it work. This foundation also oxidizes orange..so not just a shade but it'll turn more orange as well. I'm gonna try to find something to mjx it with but I won't be purchasing again and wouldn't recommend it. * I have oily combo skin, and this foundation did not stand the test of time. It felt very heavy, and transferred with the slightest touch (with setting powder). Only a few hours in, and it was breaking apart on my face, highlighting even the slightest texture. My pores were literally drinking this product up. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a foundation, and could not wait to take it off. * I have combo skin, I use the Bobby brown moisturizer primer underneath and only use a tiny bit with a brush. Looks flawless!! Do not use to much product otherwise it will look cakey, if you need extra coverage apply only to specific area with smaller brush. * 32f (no active breakout/indented scars only on cheeks/combination skin)This foundation has the worst formula I have ever used on my skin. I tried two different primers underneath and tried it on it's own and it just refused to settle or smooth out. It creases badly and makes skin look dry and caked with very minimal use of the product that looked worse and worse if you tried to use even a tiny bit more. Powders and setting spray do nothing to help. I tried beauty blenders and brushes and neither made it better. I ended up going back to a trusty Revlon foundation that was way cheaper and a much better formula. Do not waste your money if you do not have perfect smooth skin. * I have sensitive skin with large amounts of rosacea and occasional eczema. This product covers my redness very well, and can many my dry areas seemingly disappear. Smashbox was also a line that came up multiple times during my search for products best for sensitive skin. * Maybe this just doesn't work with some skin types. I've given this several goes with different amounts of product and application techniques and it always manages to cake up and accentuate every pore after it's settled. I decided to give this one more go, applying after a glowy moisturizer that managed to save some of my other cakey products and it still had the same issues after setting for about 20 minutes. * It has perfect coverage,  a very little goes a long way.  Love the Matt finish I got.  Like  all foundations,  you have to prepare your skin before you applying anything to it.  Use a brush to apply.  I patted it on."
