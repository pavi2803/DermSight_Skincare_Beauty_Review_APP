This is the foundation I had been looking for all my adult life. This goes on smooth, doesn't crease or smudge. The only thing is that it can be a little dry but it's not terrible and can hardly notice I just notice the smallest of things but this foundation is my holy grail * I had really high hopes for this one. You would think that there would be ONE high end foundation that can last all day on oily skin. This looks beautiful when you put it on. It blots well. However, touch it once and it rubs right off. It gets very oily. I had spots from my glasses rub off that hadnt with any other foundation. Sooooo disappointed. Oily skin girls need a good foundation too!!! * I love this foundation so much, only one i ever loved this much, and yet distribution center has NONE of the shade i always get, also to those who hate this foundation, you're doing it wrong, you're not suppose to use this foundation with an oil based primer. its going to seperate if you do, because oil and silicone dont go together. ALSO you're suppose to shake it every time before you use it, obviously many people have no reading comprehension skills. * I'm 60 yrs old. Really good. Very pleased. I did have to change the color when I picked it up. Way different. * This is a solid option for someone looking for more a skin tint looking foundation. It is easily applied and does stay put but doesn't cover much. Wore to a funeral and it stayed put and looked nice. * Urban decay makes some solid foundations for oily skin. The Stay Naked foundation is my holy grail… however… the foundation is amazing. 16 hour wear test and when my oils break through its more of a glowy look. I put it on with mu fingers and the finish looked great. I set it with RCMA powder and thr All Nighter setting spray. I will be repurchasing this foundation. Its a bit pricey but im impressed."

Best coverage, color match and longevity. Love everything about it. * its not a full coverage foundation * I have tried many foundations and this will always be my go to. I have acne scars and this covers them and leaves such a glow natural finish. I'm obsessed. * Its patchy, it slides off my skin no matter what setting product i put over it. If you have any kind of lines on your forehead, around your nose, mouth its goong to soak in those lines. Just the worst foundation i have ever bought which is extremely disappointing given the price and brand. * This foundation is top tier. Originally I was a little concerned about the fragrance but its been a few months and I havent broken out (I have ezcema too). It gives the most natural glow but doesnt make you look oily. No one can ever tell I'm wearing foundation when I wear this. The foundation looks best if you exfoliate your skin and use toner + moisturizer. I usually apply with my hands or spatula. I usually blend it out with fingers and/or a beauty blender."

It might look fine from far away, but up close is a big ol' mess. It settles in to lines and pores (especially pores!), even if you put a good primer beforehand and set it with a very fine powder. Maybe if pores and wrinkles aren't a problem for you, this might be a great choice. For me, it's just another foundation that doesn't work well enough, especially for the price. 

The range of shades has gotten a lot better over the years, so kudos on that. * I used the original Teint Idol for so many years, I can't even remember how far back. People complemented my on my skin and didn't think I was wearing makeup. It matched my skin shade, lasted all day, and didn't irritate my highly sensitive skin. I have tried two bottles of this new stuff, can't get the same color match, and don't like the thin, greasy formula or the way it sweats off easily after exercise. It isn't the same product all all, despite the name. * I was using another brand which changed their formula. I need a matte because I have oily skin and this works perfectly for me. The color match is the best foundation match for me and it doesn't transfer! It's more expensive but for me, it's worth it! * I would recommend using this product with a damp sponge to pat on application * Will make you a doll face. PERFECT color match. A little goes a long way, this will last me at minimum 3 months so the cost per use more than justifies the price. At 6 hrs I have to do a little tap tap blend blend on my dry spots & blot my oily areas w/ MAC Blot Powder but after that it goes for another 6 hours. Love it! * I was looking for a full coverage makeup because of some bruising on my face.  I actually really like it and I am still wearing it now that the bruising is gone.  It doesn't feel too thick, and is still wonderful coerage. * it does not stay on my face."

Was looking for a dupe for discontinued The Ordinary Serum foundation, but this is too heavy. Good for more ""made up"" look IMO. Don't love how the pump works. * One of my HG foundations! I have the shade Vallauris and it blends effortlessly with medium buildable coverage. It looks natural and has a natural finish that isn't too dewy. I have combo oily acne-prone skin and it lasts all day. It doesn't break me out. Try it! * Perfect product!I don't think ill buy any other foundation. no other foundation would compare.will be using this product forever.goes so nicely on the skin and stays all days.Good coverage for every day looks and special occasions.defiently would buy this ASAP. * This foundation is great but I can only use it in the summer because there is no shade light enough for winter me. The shade I use for summer is pushing it. It's pretty dark but so beautiful on. Please make a greater shade range! Thank you! * I love this product but it comes open sometimes and it is way too expensive to receive an empty bottle. * I love this foundation, it matches my skin color and tone very well (I am very fair with cool undertones got the color ""Oslo""). I have been looking for a foundation that has good coverage, but doesn't feel heavy. It is a great foundation that you can ""build."" This is a great match for me. I have worn it for hours and it doesn't feel cakey, or heavy. It feels natural. I'm so happy I was able to try this product. * So this foundation is extremely hyped and I do think it's pretty, but i had to change my routine up to get any meaningful wear out of it. I know some people don't believe in the whole water based and silicone debate but i had to get a water based primer because it was separating with silicone.
It also doesn't really hold up to all day wear in my opinion, especially in warmer weather. On the NARS website it says you can pair with radiant Creamy Concealer but that has silicone so i noticed it would separate around my undereyes as well when i did that. I would say it's fine for like a date night or family gathering but not too sure about clubbing or all day wear. I will probably get radiant longwear next because it's silicone based and has a specified wear time of 12 hours, this one does not"

This was a patchy, hard to blend mess. Even on my oily skin, it was horrendous. Why fix what wasn't broken? Time to find a new foundation... * I'm 70 years old, and have used this product for many years! First because it made my skin look good when I was younger! Well, now I love it more because it does a great job covering my ""old age spots""!!! I never was into putting on too much make-up, but I ALWAYS make sure I have plenty of this on hand😊 * I have been wearing my old formulae for over 10 yrs . This new formula I cannot seem to find my match at all . My skin looks orange or to light and it just do not look right on my skin . I am in the process of looking into another company because no one could match me * I've used Studio Fix for years and always swore by it. But ever since they switched to this new formula It has made me break out terribly, and it seems to get oily looking so fast now. Unfortunately I am switching to something else completely. Sad day! * Why would they change the formula!! It was perfect before! Now the color doesnt match and its drying!! * I have worn this product for a while thank God they have placed the pump on there. Years ago we had to purchase the pump. I like the location so I don't have to go in mall. Very convenient * Why oh why would MAC take an amazing and classic staple in so many of our lives and completely slaughter it!?!  I can't find the words to truly describe how deeply hurt I am with the reformulation of MAC Studio Fix Fluid!  A foundation that I've wore for 15+ years! If it ain't broke don't fix it!  Just create a completely new makeup but leave the OG alone!  The new foundation is horrific.  I've given it a try TWICE!  It changes colors, oxidizes to a shade that's not true to the skin like the old formula, and gets super oily and cakey really fast.  Ever since this change I've been on a hunt for something else and nothing else compares to the original SFF.  This has rocked so many of our lives, it should be illegal!!"

It goes on so nice and matches my skin tone perfectly. I only have to apply it in the morning and don't need to touch it up during the day. * For the cost this compact should be way sturdier and have an applicator that you can actually use. It's very loose and breaks apart easily and the sponge they send with it is just ridiculous. I'm returning it and looking for something better * Gave me an alergic reaction. Mightve just been my skin but usually my skin is pretty okay when trying new things. This product gave me a bunch of little bumps all over my face and gave me dry patches. * I like this product,but I think I need a little moisturizer. * So disappointing. I am almost out of the original product (I stocked up when I saw they were changing it)  I went to Ulta to try to find my shade in the new 16 hour formula. The suggested shade wasn't a match and this one also enhances my pores and fine lines. I will be returning and starting the search for a new product.  I used to receive so many compliments and people asking what I use. I am so bummed they changed this product as I've been using this for years. * Coverage was lacking, too sheer for me * Small amount of product for the price so you start hitting the pan soon.
As you hit pan, chunks fall out onto your table when you open it so you lose product. NOT worth the price. Nothing about this product is 16 hours, certainly not the coverage. I have Medium 30 cool and the color match is good, which is the only reason for the 1 star."

I love how bendable and smooth it goes on. It gives a good amount of coverage as well. Highly recommend! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. * As soon as i applyed this foundation it was immediately cakey. Wore it for a few hours and it settled into my fine lines ans vasically melted off :( * I absolutely love this product! It has such an easy application. A little bit goes a long way, so the bottle lasts a loong time if you use it correctly. Once I apply it, I always have  a natural and smooth look. Highly recommend. ( I use the shade 440) * Great coverage great when finish love the blendingability and love the scent and great packaging amazing by the way it covers my face loving the finish line * Great for skin * Bought this foundation last year, best one I have ever tried so far! If you're a dry skin girly then i recommend you do a really good hydrating skincare routine before you apply the foundation (you really should do a hydrating skincare routine before makeup even if you have oily skin actually) and also be sure to finish with a good setting spray to seal everything and be sure there wont be much transfer. Wore this foundation to a concert last year during summer and makeup was still intact afyer several hours in the humid heat and hours of dancing. * I cant wear this foundation year around. Im combination skin type. During the summer months, i use this travel size of soft matte because i dont need a lot and its the perfect amount for the few summer months. No more wasting foundation."

It's my "" go to"" summer foundation. It goes on smooth and is light enough to wear every day.  I love that it has SPF in it too.  It gives me just the right coverage for summer * So glad I tried this in the store before purchasing.  The cool colors are a bit too orange but almost a good match.  The issue is it never fully dries. I tried on several colors in the store and figured it would be dry by the time I got home.  No, it still felt tacky and even 6 hours later still feels like it never fully dried, meaning every time I touch my hand to my face it feels tacky and rubs off easily onto my hand.  Because it just sits on top of skin and never fully dries, it transfers easily.  Big no for me. * Tried wearing this a few times but it makes my face break out every single time. It also makes my skin very oily. * Let me preface by saying I am a big fan of what I've tried of IT, with a couple exceptions including this product. my tube looks like it came already oxidized. I know that the colors have changed, but nothing with the word fair in it should be that dark. it also has a tendency to transfer and after a couple hours in this it feels like it literally melts off your face making the transferring worse. 

I'll stick with CC illumination and ByeBye foundation tinted moisturizer (this product has some transfer issues too, but can be easy to remedy with a touch of powder or setting spray sprayed on and allowed to dry completely before finishing your other makeup or before heading out. * Absolutely adore this formula - hydrating, light coverage, no sparkle/glitter, and  genuinely looks my skin but better. It's a 6-star formula. Sadly, the shade is 1-star. Orange is a warm tone, and therefore should not be described as ""cool"" or ""rosy"". Not returning because I love coverage, but likely won't repurchase unless the add genuinely cool shades. * I love IT products. I have been using IT foundations for years but had not tried this one. My friend had switched to this product and her skin looked amazing, so I gave it a try. Absolutely love it. A little goes a long way. This is my foundation of choice from now on. * I have been using this foundation for several years and love it. I have fair skin and sun damage from many years ago so have to be very careful to protect my skin. This gives me the best of both worlds…good coverage and looks good. No creasing in fine lines either."

Im sure this is beautiful on more mature skin, but if youre acne prone steer clear. * Ive always loved makeup, a full face. But when my skin starts to flake and my foundation is dry, i hate it. I wanted to stop wearing makeup completely until i tried this product. She's perfect!! No seperating, doesnt dry me out, she's flawless for 9+ hours. (I have always skin prepped so that wasnt my issue) i set with the laura m ultra blurring translucent power, chefs kiss. If you have dry skin, this product is game changing. * Dry skin girl here…great foundation for me!! Medium coverage, nice glowy finish. If you have oily skin, skip this one. Doesnt settle in pores. I do set with mac mineralize powder, setting this foundation makes a huge difference to me. With powder I get around 10-12 hours wear. Recommend for anyone with dry and/or mature skin!! * I've had acne and redness my whole adult life (39 yrs old); I've tried so many foundations but this one is my absolute favorite. A small amount provides great medium coverage, it stays in place, blends well, and gives my pores am airbrushed look. * I bougth it for fhe SPF but toure better off getting an SPf moserizer. This peels on the face and doesnt sit well on the face. I wojld t recommed :( * Over priced. You can get better tinted BB at the drugstore"

By the latter part of the day it looked slick and oily in the cheek, jaw, nose and brow areas thus looking uneven in coverage.  Primer and a setting spray were used. * I'm a big fan of it cosmetics from their regular cc cream to the glowing cc cream and their dark spot concealer. I have oily skin so I decided to try this matte version. It was the worst decision I've made!! Every time using it, it leaves my skin looking patchy and cakey. I've tried everything by mixing it with moisturizer or oil, layering extra moisturizer before applying it, but nothing worked… On the same day I tested my new lancome foundation and it just performed so much better on my skin. Unfortunately, I'll have to toss this out. Total waste of money!! * This make up is not goof for older looking skin.  .  It is very matte and does not feel like it had any moisture .  Reviews said it was matte but made skin look moisturized.  Not on me.  I bought the It Bye Bye Foundation and like it much better. * Leaves my nose very oily and glossy by mid day. Not sure it's for me. Coverage is good * For this product to lay remotley nicely on your skin you need to jump through so many hoops in terms of skin prep (i.e. exfoliate, hydrating, moisturize (but not too much), etc). This is a very finicky product that can very quickly look cakey and unflattering. Also this did not do a great job at controlling oils in my t zone and will emphasize any dryness on the skin. * I have used IT products for years so when I saw this in the store I thought I would try it. What a mistake. This foundation is awful. It's thick and heavy. Gets into every pore and wrinkle.  I would not recommend. * You can see pores and makes you break out"

I'm glad it works for other people, but it's not a good option for me. * It blends well and covers amazing, especially on my dark spots. * Its a amazing foundation it has allot of coverage and its dewy but i would have given a 5 star if it didnt crack or looked blouchy and if it wouldnt smear if you are a active person. If you would just wear it for a normal day its recommended but if you are a dancer or workout or active in other ways not recommended even with setting spray i had no luck. I did try it with a photo hd primer. * Blends in so well * Absolutely love this foundation! Great coverage with a small amount, blends well, feels light and doesnt settle into fine lines or pores. Vegan with natural ingredients! * This foundation has the absolute best coverage.  There are times when you need that extra coverage and with Face Tape Foundation you can definitely get it!  

My only issue is that unless you get your primer just right, its going fine every bit of dry skin and wrinkle to settle into. * I have used all the big brands - Armani, Dior, MAC, Haus, Estee, Bobbi - none make my face look perfect like this formula.

The only pros to this is the shade match was spot on, and it didn't feel like I was wearing anything on my skin. * Easy buildable coverage . Leaves my skin glowy but not an oily finish * This skin tint is the best foundation/skin tint I have ever used and I've tried it all. From luxury and prestige brands to drug store brands, I've tried so many. I still try new things but I always go back to this one. I have pretty oily skin and EVERYTHING ends up seperating and getting cakey on me. NOT THIS!!! I wear this everyday for about 12 hours a day and it still looks amazing when I wash it off at night. I hooe Maybeline never discontinues this bc it is my all time favorite and I will use it for as long as they make it!! I recommend this to everyone I know!! * This feels like powder mixed with water. I like how it is thin, but it did dry out my skin and started to look flaky within an hour. * Very nice full to medium coverage tint easy to blend and work with * I absolutely love this foundation! It feels so light weight but definitely buildable. If you want more sheer coverage use alot less! 
If you have combo/ oily skin you will love this! I wore it from 1pm to 1am and omg i was shook! My skin looked amazing i hardly had to touch it up! Made my skin look and feel good. I did get a shade too dark but i made it work ☺️"

It doesn't really set down, even with powder. I have dry skin and never have issues with uneven coverage or getting a foundation to set down, with or without setting powder. I'm just not a fan, I have wet n wild, Catrice, urban decay and Pat McGrath foundations that all perform better across the cost spectrum. * This a wonderful foundation. It gives perfect coverage, making my skin look dewy and fresh.   The best part is that it is a clean product, without the bad stuff.I love this brand. * Not enough coverage for my aging skin! * Unsure. It's not like it's a bad product. I feel it's good quality. I think maybe for a lighter foundation could be a good find. I feel for the price, what my expectations were; not a good buy necessarily. Fell a bit flat for me. I've also only used a couple (2-3) times. Maybe it grows. My skin feels nice.
I don't feel excited afterwords-if that makes sense? Sometimes I put on foundation and I'm like ""OO-Hello there!"" I put this on and feel like…ehh. Best way I can put it. I did have a more positive prospective when adding a glow enhancer. It's ok. * I used this for about a year. I have combo/oily skin and this slid off my face whenever i went out. I would typically use a primer too and it didnt help. Also, it provides almost no coverage for me. All in all, defintely regret trying it. I will say, it adds a nice glow if your skin is in good shape and you stay inside. * I was looking for something that is light on my skin and it covers my pores , I just love this product. My skin doesn't feel flaky, it's not dry at all. * Good color match but finish was way too dewy looking and made my face look oily."

I am in my 50's and it covers all of my imperfections. Looks so natural that I  have people tell me how beautiful my skin is. My favorite thing about this product is that I can build it to my liking without it looking caked. * It was the perfect last step for my make up. Really helped to cover up some of the redness in my chin and nose. * So happy the sunscreen was removed. The increase in skin cancer since the sunblock/fear the sun campaign started, has skyrocketed. And our d has plummeted. Oral D, no good. Sun is above us for a reason, a VITAL reason. * I love the coverage and it's very easy to apply.  The only thing that I don't like is that I have oily skin and I am already oily within a few hours. * I use Fair liquid foundation so bough fair powder and the color does not match at all. The powder also does not sit well on the face. * I use all the CC products from IT. There is no other brand that minimizes my redness as well as this brand. I also don't have any issues with product settling in my fine lines and pores. * so impressed ! I have never been a powder girly. only liquid . and setting powder. but I love this ! you don't even need a lot. and it covers my rosacea ! love ! 😍 and as a mama, so good for on the go !"

I saw so many good reviews and decided to buy it. The first time the color oxide so bad, it left me red and orange by 3 shades darker, not impressed I decided to color exchange. Even then it's too dark, so I go 2 shades darker, and I finally have somewhat of a good color match. But despite the color match, the wear is terrible. I tried primer, no primer, moisturizer, no moisturizer, almost every single possible match, and it does not work. It left my skin so textured and patchy, it shocked me. I'm very much an Estee Lauder girl because she leaves me silky yet matte. But unfortunately this foundation did not cut it, and I really wanted to like it. * Loved the coverage and how long it lasted. However I was orange by the end of the day. It oxidized rather quickly. It's unfortunate because it really lasted all day in a kitchen without making me shiny. * even with a good skin care routine, i still have those days where i break out from time to time. This foundation blurs out my breakouts PERFECTLY, giving me smooth skin as long as i set with powder. Literally my holy grail. * 10/10 recommend. color is spot on. I can wear all day. * Its very full coverage! But there are also barley any neutral shades mostly yellows and oranges and it is super SUPER thick * I'm in my mid 40's, so my skin has changed quite a bit since I started wearing makeup. My old ""holy grail"" Foundation no longer worked for my more mature skin. It took me SIX years to find something I really loved, and this is it. It's surprisingly lightweight for how full coverage it is and it stayed IN TACT for several hours in 100⁰ weather on my skin. I had read that it could be drying on dry to combination skin, and I did not find that to be true. For many years, I was a silicone based primer girlie, and you absolutely need water based with this foundation. lt is also very necessary to swatch IN PERSON and let it dry down before you buy in order to get the right color match because the wet to dry color is often significantly different and it was impossible to tell what would be my best match online."

It looks bad immediately upon application, and does not last throughtout the day. I have used the original formula for years, it was my favorite foundation. I will not continue using it with this new formula. Please bring the old foundation back. * Very close to the Armani foundation. Absolutely love- the only thing is it separates in my nose bc of my glasses. * They have added a comedogenic ingredient (BISMUTH OXYCHLORIDE) which can cause acne, itching, redness, and rashes especially in those with sensitive skin. Will no longer be using this foundation with their new formula for this reason. It's so hard to find makeup that is truly noncomedogenic and they just ruined this one for me. * This foundation is amazing! Its super lightweight and the coverage is awesome. I like this more than any other expensive foundations that I have used before. Highly recommend! * They have changed the formula and messed with the shades! I'm so disappointed becuase 395 Rose Pearl was my PERFECT shade and had such a wonderfully natural finish. I recently had to repurchase and the new formulation sucks. The new 395 is very yellowy in color, the texture is cakey, and it creases like crazy. I'm legitimately so upset that they've messed up what used to be the best foundation ever. * Nobody asked for vitamin C in the foundation this is terrible. Used to be my favorite foundation but now they reformulated it it and its so hard to blend, it doesnt mix well with concealer and i cracks and dries patchy so dissapointed * This used to live up to its name when I got it about 2-3 years ago and really was the best drugstore foundation... after reformulation it separates like crazy does not wear well at all even with setting spray and powder.

I have worn this foundation for years and have received several compliments on my makeup looking flawless, until they had to go and change the formula. It separates horribly, my skin feels greasy and it's definitely not an all day wear. Bare Minerals bring back the old formula. This stuff is garbage. * I used to love bare pro foundation but they recently created a new formula. It is terrible. I have to shake it every time because it separates but even after I shake it, it comes out in blobs with a thin liquid leaking everywhere. Very disappointed. * I tried this foundation after my go-to was discontinued. Unfortunately, it was too heavy for me. I understand it's full coverage but I was hoping that would be buildable. Even half a pump was a lot for me, and the formulation is thick so you have to blend quickly. I will say though, it has very strong staying power and my face wasn't oily even after 8 hours of dancing in the summer humidity. It'd be great for a wedding or event where you want that heavier coverage with staying power, but it's a little too heavy for everyday wear (at least to me). * I've worn the barepro foundation for years and loved it. This new foundation is horrible. I thought it was just me but after reading reviews, I know I'm not alone. This initially looks good with great coverage. Within a few hours, it looks cakey and heavy. Separates in my t zone by mid day. Rubs off very easily. I will be looking for something else unfortunately. * I loved the old formula but they decided to change it. This new formula is so greasy, it feels like its lard with a tint of color. With the amount of oil in this formula you will obviously break out. I only wore it twice and I still can't recover from the pimples this was 3 months ago. Not Texas Heat aproved. Doesnt matter how much powder you add on top or setting spray it moves everywhere. * This use to be my go to! I have very oily skin so this would keep that at bay and not transfer on my clothes or husband when i would kiss him. This new formula looks good when you first put it on. But once you go out in the heat it melts off. It is not transfer resistant anymore! It stays greasy and gets on everything. It also settles into fine lines and makes them more noticeable.

I've tried sooo many other foundations like fenty, hause labs, makeup forever, and too faced and always went back to eeste lauder even though it emphasized my skin texture. I love this foundation! It melts into the skin, has a beautiful finish, and is buildable. It's what I wanted hause labs to be except it's not super oily. When combined with the setting powder it looks like a real life filter. * I'm over 50 and this is the best foundation I've tried so far. Non drying, doesnt cake, buildable  coverage but the pump on the bottle broke after a week and the shape of the bottle makes it hard to get the product out. * Bought this with high hopes seeing everyone be so beautfiul. Not worth hype feels like normal forndation. Doesn't cover much even with layering. I have some acne scariing and it shows through. I try not to wear foundation that is heavy so at least rhat part was ok. But mot the holy grail eveeyone keeps saying it is. * I was hoping the hype for this product was true and it is! * As an oily skin girly, my go to is normally Estee Lauder Double Wear or the new UD. This hasnt lasted all day on my skin and has been COMPLETELY matte. I used the PS powder w it. Stayed more matte than either of my reuglar foundations do! * As an esthetician that focuses on natural, non-toxic ingredients this foundation was a GOD SEND! It works wonderfully on all skin types, not cakey at all, and I love that it's buildable. 

I've seen a lot of negative reviews just because the pump has broken for people…I don't understand that. Just unscrew it and use a brush or spatula to get it out. Not a reason to dock the rating all the way to 1 star. I highly recommend this!! * I never leave reviews but had to for this. I've tried every foundation on the market, even the $100+ ones but this is the BEST one I have tried!! It is full coverage, smoothing/blurring, AND good for you ingredients! I use this and their loose powder and it looks like i have a filter on. Probably the only foundation and powder i will use from now on"

It has a lovely satin matte finish that stays put on my combination skin and provides good coverage without looking unnatural. Alabaster was the best shade for my light, cool-neutral skin tone. * This is the second Clinique product I will be returning. Despite moisturizer, primer & setting spray, this is all over my phone, steering wheel, clothes, etc despite being in climate controlled environment all day. It has oxidized super orange & is blotchy and separated within an hour or two of wear. I would not recommend this to anyone * I have searched for a make up that was all day coverage instead of putting it on and hour later it looks like I never had makeup on! THIS IS IT! I absolutely love the coverage and it last all day! * I'm mature (56) with normal/dry skin.   This foundation needs a light hand and thin layers or looks heavy.  With a primer and a light hand, it is beautiful.  Natutal finish, medium buildable coverege, lasts all day.   Cream chamois was great shade match, I am light medium cool neutral.  I am reaching for this for work on the daily, its a reliable foundation.  Happy to have this! * Applied with a damp beauty blender after my usual skin care prep and it looks better than any other product I've used in a long time. My skin looks flawless and the color match is perfect CN90sand. I highly recommend * I'm so glad I came across this foundation. It looks so natural and matches my skin perfectly.

I apply it with a brush, and it is like swiping an airbrush filter over my face and feels like nothing is on!  I would say the finish is 'soft matte' - it takes down shine and doesn't look dry, cakey, or flat.  Very easy to work with and pretty amazing results.  I travelled with it recently, and it very travel-friendly - doesn't seems fragile and is just so darn easy, fast, and fuss-free to apply (no extra setting powder needed).  Because it is lighter coverage (light-to-medium coverage) than other options, I have slotted this as a go-to everyday or light-makeup-day foundation.  The color match for me is spot-on as well - I got 'R4' which blends to my skin color/tone as well as my favorite reference shade, which is Estee Lauder Double Wear in 2C3 Fresco. * I usually wear liquid products but decided to get a powder for the summer and thought it try this. I used the find my shade feature and it ended up being the perfect match!! It looks amazing on and very natural. I also have very sensitive skin and I have no reaction after applying. Highly recommend to try!! * This is, by far, one of the best powder foundations I have ever purchased. There are so many shades to choose from, and the associate who took the time to help me find the best match, was excellent. The coverage is buildable, and it wears very well and does not settle into fine lines. Highly recommended! * Great for aging skin, doesn't settle, crease. Goes on smooth, light coverage (buildable). I love it, all DM is amazing, everything I've tried❣️👱🏻‍♀️ * I've always been a little hesitant with powder foundations. For reference I have combo skin (oily t-zone, dry elsewhere), and this looks beautiful on both skin concern areas! It doesn't catch onto dry patches and melts well into my oily areas. A slight complaint is the amount of kick-back the powder produces in the compact, so it can be a little messy, but it's really not a big deal. * I  asked an Ulta sales woman to help me cover  my red peeling skin 7 days after a microneedling  appointment. She used an IT makeup brush and miraculously this  glam facial foundation completely beautifully professional coverage.
This foundation is light, and doesn't feel like I had a makeup on. This was surprisingly as I have dry skin.
Expensive, but well worth buying. * I have never really used powdered foundation until finding out about Natasha Denona's. As a fan of her eyeshadow, concealer, blush and eyeliners... I was amazed! 

It gives a nice natural coverage that is somewhat luminous. I will say, if you have enlarged pores or fine lines, you may have to find yourself reapplying to those areas. It did not accentuate your pores, but if you struggle with that area I would recommend a primer, as it didn't cover them up completely. It is great for covering redness, dullness and uneven skin tone! 

Personally after a 12 hour night shift of wearing this foundation, I would say it transferred minimally without a primer or setting powder. I used the elf power grip setting spray, and it helped seal the foundation better. 
It's super easy to blend contour, blush, bronzer and highlighter on top of this! 

I would give this a 94% satisfaction rate and recommend it to those with more normal, sensitive, combo or even oily skin types."

This stuff is amazing at accomplishing both. It goes on beautifully. I work 12-hour shifts, and it still looks good when I wash it off. I can't say enough good things about this foundation. L'Oreal knocks it out of the park again. * This foundation is amazing! It's the first one I've tried that doesn't make me break out, which is a miracle. I've used it everyday since trying it and I'm so thankful! * Your skin but better. This comes in a glass bottle with a nice weight to it. It's a dropper top so it's a little messier than other foundations that are squeeze tube or with a pump. Shake very well before use. The shade was just a little too pink for me, however, I made it work. The formula left my skin feeling soft and fresh. About five or six hours into the day I did have some oil breakthrough in my tea zone but even using papers it did not remove the product. It wore well throughout the day. Definitely needs a powder or setting spray to sit down and hold into place, so it doesn't crease. Nice shade range. I may try another shade. * I have been using this skin tint for almost a year now, I love everything about it but the pump! People ask me what foundation I use everytime I wear it. It just evens out the skintone so perfectly without making you look cakey or like theres just too much makeup on. I would probably buy less bottles if the applicator wasnt the way it is though :( * Sheer coverage which I like, and stays on your face, even on oily skin, but noticed increase in acne after starting to use it. * This is a great product if you are not looking for full coverage and want something light. It gives me such a pretty glow and is easy to blend. I am giving four stars because of the bottle- the applicator is awful. Also I may need to buy another bottle because it's so hard to find the right shade."

I've tried Laura Geller, Clinique, KVD, Il Makiage, etc., and I believe my search is over now that I have found Charlotte Tilbury's Airbrush Flawless. For those having problems with it looking cakey, the most important thing to remember is skin prep ... make sure you use a good cleanser, toner, serum and moisturizer prior to your foundation always. It took me awhile to really accept how important skin prep is but it is so true! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this foundation! It truly does look flawless. My very unobservant husband even commented on my makeup the first time I used this foundation ... he said my skin had a beautiful and healthy glow.
Thank you Charlotte Tilbury! * Has beautiful coverage especially for those that have acne scarring and redness like myself! I didnt get oily all day and wasnt transfering off. * A little definitely goes a long way with this product coverage-wise but it left my makeup with an odd texture and a matte finish (in a bad way) that tended to look cakey even with just a small amount of foundation. The color 3C also didn't match the 3C from my tube of Charlotte's Beautiful Skin Foundation. Not the worst foundation I've ever tried but not worth keeping. Returned. * This foundation can withstand Texas heat! Full Coverage and doesn't feel too heavy on the skin. 100x better than the Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation.This Foundation lasts all day will definitely purchase again. * I have combination skin, very oily t zone. I wore this to an outdoor festival and it was very humid.
By the time I got home, it still looked great! 
A little amount goes a long way * This foundation is so cakey and shows everything single imperfection . Im 40 and when i wore this i felt 10 years old yuck looks like the makeup they ise at funeral homes you want flawless skin ! With nice coverage hourglass veil is the hold grail and hydration with your radiating youth  and health skin . I would never Ever wear this again i rather go bare skin . 
To each thier own opinion this is mine 💪🏻 * I PAID for this and it's horrible, I have mature skin and this really makes my skin look worse. The 5 ⭐ review's are given this product for FREE and in order to keep the stuff coming they will ALWAYS give the same review's. I found that it's best to wait a few weeks before buying then decided when I see the HONEST review's and in this case it doesn't look good."

I liked that this claimed to improve bare skin and had heard great things about it cosmetics. it went on nicely, but by the 2nd hour this made me look like a grease ball, accentuated texture that wasn't quite there to begin with, and felt slimy. not for me and I would not repurchase. the shade was fine, just didn't care for the product itself. * I've tried many foundations over the years and this one is my absolute favorite! It's so easy to blend, leaves a beautiful skin like finish and lasts all day. I haven't gone back to any other foundations, this is my tried and true * There were things I liked about this foundation-the skincare benefits, the light feel and look after initial application BUT, it was watery so it sunk into my pores and emphasized the texture of my skin horribly. It also had zero staying power. It was usually breaking up or worn off within three or four hours but still managed to remain lodged in my pores further emphasizing them. If you aren't worried about pores and skin texture you might want to try this but it did not work for my more mature skin. * This is by far my favorite foundation. It is a perfect color match and provides a beautiful finish to my skin. It is natural looking on the skin and doesn't settle in lines. * This is one of the besy foundations i hsve used!  It covers really well without being or feeling heavy!   Looks beautiful on!!!! Love love love it!  Im 51!  Wears all dsy! * This is a fantastic lightweight, lighter coverage foundation. I'm 50 and was formerly an oily skin girl so I dislike anything dewy. This is just the perfect finish and coverage. I use a minimal amount and blend with the It Cosmetics heart shaped brush. Looks like i have nothing on my skin. Never gets cakey or settles into lines. I believe this has improved my skin."

The one thing that's tough for me is the pump. It stopped working notmally halfway through the bottle. It makes it so hard to yse and i hope they fix this in the future. * I was pleasantly surprised how moisturizing this foundation is. Feels like creamy lotion going on but not heavy or sticky. Wears well and looks dewy, doesn't seem to settle in fine lines. * I had high hopes.  The formula feels nice and the color was right, but that was it.  Looked good when I  first applied.  Looked in the mirror about 6 hours later and it had oxidized, worn off (didn't touch my face all day), had patchy spots , and settled big time in my pores.  By the way, I work from home on a computer all day, so wasn't even outside.  Quite possibly the worst foundation I've ever used.  Don't waste your money. * Excellent &  hydrating my new fave product * This foundation is SO overhyped. In the details of the foundation, it says oil control! What a joke! This is the most greasy feeling and oily foundation I have ever used. It transfers even with the laura mercier powder, breaks down within an hour, and has barely any coverage. But then somehow also clings to the very few dry patches I have AND enhances every wrinkle I have. Horrible! * The formula feels nice on the skin, but it's not for oily skin by any means of the imagination. Every time I have used it I have broken out. I don't usually have acne at all (I suffered when I was younger but not anymore), and every time I get multiple break outs. * To start this foundation broke me out, it looks great at first but within 2-3 hours it breaks down and transfers on everything. Everytime i slighty touched my face it transferred off and i can see the foundation on my french tip nails. This isnt a long lasting foundation whatsoever.

Perfect size for travel. * The formula has to be different because the make up is very cakey. I used to get so many compliments on my skin. In the middle of the day, my make up looks terrible. My friend also has noticed this too! * Im obsessed. I finally found a good foundation!! The color matches almost perfect, doesn't oxidize, gets better the longer you wear it. 100% recommend * This goes on smooth and covers redness and hides other imperfections I have gathered in my 53 years!  I feel like a new person!!! * I stopped wearing foundation and tinted moisturizer about a year ago because my skin was just so sensitive to it and it would dry my skin out too much. Recently, I was really wanting to try a foundation again so I decided to try this one. I've worn it for a few weeks now and have had no problems with sensitivity or dry skin. It covers well without looking caked on. I love it so far! * After discovering this product, I will never use any other tinted base or foundation ever again! A little goes so far so it will last you so long, looks beautiful and lasts even if you don't set with powder, lightweight, buildable, and best of all has SPF. i will use this forever!"

This makeup completely wrecked my skin. I've never had a major issue with acne or clogged pores until I used this crap.  (I moved shortly before switching products and thought it was a mix of a dryer climate and hard water that was making my skin look awful). It's been 9 days since I stopped using this brand/products and it's crazy how much better my skin looks and feels. * For starters, this product is perfect for those ""no makeup"" look days! I wore this, went to a water park for 5 hours, and my face didnt get sunburned! * Love this moisturizer. Feels light and gives the perfect amount of color and a smooth look. * I asked the clerk for medium coverage. This product barely provides any coverage, It is just tinted moisturizer. * I love this tinted moisturizer and I recommend it for people with normal or dry skin. My only problem I had was that it looked a bit orange but once I put it on and spread it out it was perfect. Really good for the no makeup makeup look that's popular currently and for a quick everyday style. * I really wanted to love this! I pretty much onlt wear skin tints and ive tried quite a few. This one would have been great for me.. but if you sweat or live in a rainy climate DO NOT BUY! It literally melted off my face any time I got rained on or sweat. Full lunes of makeup running down mt face. * I've tried a couple drug store tinted moisturizers in the past that just didn't work and I never understood the hype. But now I get it. It provides just a little bit of coverage and evens out my skin tone but it looks and feels like you're not wearing anything. It's made me so much more confident because I'm not worrying if my foundation is cakey or smudged."

I have combo skin, some dryness (tretinon based) and a slightly oily t zone.  I am 61 and have some uneven coloring . This provides nice solid medium coverage and stays in place all day for, although I do set it with the MAC loose setting powder. * I have combination skin with acne scars, reddness, and dark circles. This foundation is great for someone who wants a buildable coverage that always looks natural. I use a tiny pea-sized amount for daily wear as a concealer (which I prefer over my tarte shape tape, wear and coverage wise). For a more full glam look i'd use a full pump. It stays on all day but tends to get a little greasy but i've never had a problem with separation. Definitely school air proof with powder. * This foundation blew me away coverage is amazing and you don't have to use a lot. Definitely buying again. And it didn't really make me break out a definite plus * Very awesome * This foundation is amazing, I recently bought my second one and I believe this is the only shade that i found that goes with my skin color! 
It works well with combination skin, which thats what i have. Its super hydrating and coverage is great."

I love that it doesn't transfer when I blot my face. * This is a great foundation that offers medium coverage, long wear and a soft matte finish. I have been using it since Perfection Lumiere was discontinued in the USA around 2019. Le Teint is similar but less heavy.  I went hiking in summer and it stayed on. It does not dry out my skin. For reference, I have light olive skin and use ELDW 3N1. Chanel's shade range spans from light to dark in 3 undertones: Beige Rose (BR), Beige Doré (BD), and Beige (B).  I tried all three undertones in the light-to-medium range and settled on B30, a neutral. I set it with Chanel's loose powder #3. It doesn't burn, sting, itch, or cause break outs. I've tried other brands that irritated me after a couple of weeks. When I return to this, my skin heals and remains clear. * I ordered the B20 shade, described as a neutral undertone. as soon as I put it on, it was orange, and not for pale skin. I had to return it and was unable to exchange it for the right color because Ulta doesn't carry Chanel in store * Other department stores sell just as good coverage through meeting or cover girl this is 10 times those prices * I don't see any different coverage than a cover, Girl or Maybelline product. * I bought this foundation after using the tried and true Fenty Pro Filtr, Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush flawless and Too Faced Born this way 24hr. This is so ligtweight, easy to layer on, and great for oily skin! Choosing a shade is also pretty easy. This foundation does not oxidize or change in color  like other foundations I have used. The only con I have is the price tag, but it's worth it! * I absolutely love this foundation. I had been looking for a foundation for years that would compare to the urban decay naked formula from 2014. I honestly hated the heavy foundation trend and like foundations that dont feel heavy on the skin. This foundation looks and feels like skin. Its buildable and if you know how to prep your skin correctly lasts all day. Its the same price point as other high end foundations. This is definitely the makeup worlds best kept secret."

Do not buy! * I was expecting a little more coverage but does feel like skin. It looks beautiful but on acne days not even with a few layers it doesn't add to much coverage. * I'm so impressed by this foundation and have told all my friends about it. My skin looks incredible with it on and it applies so nicely, very light but great coverage! I dont even wear concealer with it! I put on a light moisturizer (I use Caudalie vinoperfect) and then apply the foundation with a brush. 5 stars!!! * This may be the worst foundation I've ever tried; I could not get this to apply correctly-i tried a brush, sponge and my fingers-there was just no applying this stuff. It was somewhat watery but I could not get it to spread on my face-i don't think I've ever had that happen with a foundation.  I wish I could give it 0 stars. * Looks very nice on * The best!"

It is medium coverage, but looks very lightweight and natural. I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and i have had no issues with this at all (which is a first!). It is probably $5-$10 over-priced and is also a pretty small quantity, but it is worth it as long as you aren't using it constantly. If you were, you would run out quite quickly and it just wouldn't be ant bang for your buck. * Easy, long wearing application with a natural finish.  I use a darker color as contour. * I knew I would like this product because its Lancome and they rarely if ever do anything poorly, but WOW!!! I loved this stuff!!!! It is so creamy, smooth, easily blended and has multi different uses from concealer to highlighter to all over foundation.  The formula is to die for.  I don't know how they did it but am in love! * I was honestly let down by this product. I went with a foundation stick for fuller coverage and this one has the same amount of coverage as the drugstore NYX liquid foundation. I will say that it does hold up very well and doesn't seperate or look bad after a fee hours but the coverage was not giving what was supposed to be gave.😖☺️ * I loved the coverage of the foundation stick but the product only lasted about 2 weeks * I have super dry skin that is also sensitive and acne-prone. Its been such a struggle to find a product that usnt drying and aso has good coverage. Most hydrating products are super shear. This foundation is amazing for not drying me out and for covering my healing acne and scars. My only complaint is that I just wish it were either cheaper or had more product. Aside from that, its truly amazing and feels like literally nothing on my skin while hiding all my imperfections. I highly recommend this underrated foundation and wish i had tried it sooner. * I love this product as well as the 460 shade for summer.  Both work beautifully."

Nope. I feel like this is sucking the moisture out of my skin and just makes it look dry and cakey. There's no building of coverage and forget using a foundation brush, as it makes it look worse. Others have mentioned that there is alcohol in it, which would make sense as to the way it makes my face feel. No matter the amount of skin prep I do, it just doesn't look good. I'm 38 and this is causing breakouts, which I never thought I would have a problem with at my age.

Sadly, I am still on the hunt for a good foundation that will stay during my 10-12 hour shifts. * I have combination skin and most foundations get really oily on me unless i use 2 primers and 2 setting sprays. This foundation was pretty matte on my skin even with no primer or setting spray, so I wouldn't call it hydrating but I'm not complaining.

I liked the color match, but it offers almost no coverage. Not good if you have hyperpigmentation, dark circles under your eyes, etc.

But this is still a good every day makeup. It looks very natural, good for errands and casual hangouts. Not an event makeup IMO. * This is my first time trying this foundation. I love it for my dry aging skin. It covers my sun spots well and I love the finish and that it does NOT bother my sensitive autoimmune skin issues. Also I was able to get my perfect shade first time ! It matches my skin tone perfectly ! It's worth every penny !! * The color match in this formula is beautiful but could not stand the fragrance.    My skin didn't react to it but the fragrance is strong. * So smooth, covers well. The only con about it is the Fragrance. Why the Fragrance? too strong. * held all day, even during an outdoor summer wedding. Works well with all my primers. Medium to buildable coverage. * Like the color and coverage but I do not understand how they call this hydrating. it is so drying to my skin. Several others also have this complaint on other sites so it isn't just me. I am an older individual with combination skin. this is as drying as/ or more so than the regular version. definitely a no for me unfortunately."

The shades are beautiful and it's long lasting. * I can not find a single shade that works for my skintone. I have tried plenty and I'm done wasting my money. All of the light to medium shades run yellow or much too cool… the undertone is just off, not skin-like. This reminds me of foundations back in the 90's, and not in a nostalgic way, but in a 'we haven't been able to figure out how to formulate proper shades way…' * I've been on the hunt for a new foundation for over a year as my last fav was discontinued. I love this product! The color range is fantastic and it sits and blends beautifully on the skin. It's very moisturizing so I did look a little shiny after a while but nothing a little blotting doesn't fix. Wore great throughout the day. * This is the best foundation and a lifesaver for me as an olive. Even foundations with olive shades I havent found to be properly olive. The formula is AMAZING, wears beautifully and lasts well especially after powdering. Very natural finish with medium coverage. * I wore this foundation to my friends wedding and I had never had a smoother complexion! I love how is sets with a little powder over it. Would highly recommend trying it for a medium coverage yet natural foundation! * I was skeptical about buying this foundation as ive always bad horrible luck finding one that suits my skin without feeling cakey or settling into fine lines/creases. However, i was amazed with this one. Its easily one of the best foundation ive ever used. Feels very light on the skin, blends out beautifully and evenly, with the perfect amount of coverage tbat is buildable, and the shade match was perfect (L2 Neutral), my skin still looks like skin. The doe applicator is also very nice, a little large for my liking and can be a bit difficult to pull out of the bottle, but after a few uses it has gotten much easier. For the price point, you really cant beat it. Ive fotten so many compliments since i started using it and highly recommend it."

It does not last more than four hours in the Texas heat.  It was a greasy mess.  It smeared, my mascara was even smeared because of this foundation.  It was all over the collar of my shirt.  If I touched my face, the foundation would transfer to my fingers.  There are much better options.  Lesson learned don't listen to ""beauty influencers"" on TT. * i bought this product because it claims to hydrating. not only did it enhance my dry patches, but made them worse throughout the day. * I love the look and feel of this foundation but it unfortunately breaks me out. I waited too long to return so now I'm trying to use it up because it is expensive. I just love the way my face looks with it on but not the painful pimples I get after. * Love this foundation and after use and time your skin does glow without it. It has actually helped my skin. I am a mixed woman of color and number 13 is my shade I love the golden hue it gives me. I even get compliments. Only foundation I can wear everyday without breaking out. * My favorite foundations are the Too Faced Matte for matte foundation and the original Wander Beauty foundation for a dewy or natural finish. This CT foundation makes my skin look so good even at the end of the day. The formula is really nice because after I blot and touch up with a little powder, it doesn't get cakey. I would say this is in my top favs for foundations now. * I'm so shocked to see the mixed reviews about this foundation. I got it on sale on boxycharm cause I've been wanting to try it out & I LOVED IT, it's definitely my go to now. The shade I got was a shade off so I went into Ulta to buy the correct one. I didn't have the correct primer for it so I was just wearing it over my moisturizer and sunscreen and it lasts me all day, 8+ hours. I even went on a hike right after work and yes I was a bit oily after but I just grabbed a tissue and blotted my face with it and it still looked really good. I tend to get oily on my t-zone but  I just blot with a tissue and apply blotting powder if I need to and it looks fine. I have yet to try it with primer but honestly feel like it's fine without it. Also I just dab a few dots of the foundation across my face and it covers perfectly. I also have acne prone skin and acne scars and I feel it does a good job of covering them up enough. * PROS:  Water based makeup without SPF. Light to medium coverage is easy to apply. Perfectly matches my warm and neutral skin tone. 
CONS: Transfers easily. Settles into pores and lines. Needs touch up application every few hours. 

I wanted to love Charlotte Tilbury's Beautiful foundation, but it doesn't compare to my favorite Estee Lauder medium coverage non-transfer makeup."

The pump keeps clogging, every few days when I dispense it shoots out at angles, it gets on my clothes, and I have to change last minute. It gets on the wall… its very frustrating. It is good make up, but if I am spending this much money, the packaging should be good too. * This foundation seriously changed the game for me. I have a hormonal IUD and have been on meds to correct the skin issues it has given me, and this has done wonders for controlling oil! I use the Laura Mercier Blurring Primer and this stuff, and I will never use anything else. I manage a drive-thru coffee shop so I see quite a few people daily and I get at LEAST 5-10 compliments a day on my make-up! Its worth it to have to make sure my pump is clean so it doesn't rogue squirt * The best foundation perfect match and stays on all day. * Bought this product long ago and whenever i sweat too much or my face gets oily this foundation just dissapears.. (primer elf power grip) but it makes my skin look so textured and my skin doesnt even look that textured 😭! but it never caused me breakouts!! * The foundation is fine, I would not buy it unless it's on sale because the coverage and longevity doesn't hold a candle to other lower price point foundations like Too Faced. That being said, the bottle pump is the worst, the hole is so small that it dries after each use even with the cap on. When you go to use it it squirts out everywhere and I mean everywhere. My white walls have been stained from this foundation and I have ruined several of my tops that even soaking in the most pitent stain removers will not touch. Do better Dior, this bottle is garbage and I have never had this issue with a foundation bottle. * This foundation is anazing! I use only one pump and it covers fully without looking like I am wearing a full coverage foundation. Absolutely love it! My only issue is I've noticed the pump gets clogged and can send your foundation going in an entirely different direction when pumping it out. * Loved the foundation, doesn't feel like there's anything on your face. But the bottle is horrible. The nozzle dries out between uses, and the squirts everywhere. It got all over my sheets/bedding and does not come out. Permanently stained everything."

I do enjoy this for running errands or short excursions. * Fenty  foundation stick convenient, goes on smooth * I love the finish but it turns orange :( 
Shade 16, my brightening concealer doesn't balance out the oxidation either but it's a good formula. Gonna try and use a blue concealer to cancel out the orange and hope it works. I do like the Anastasia Balm with the Fenty hydrating concealer and Fenty matte powder foundation together though. * This unfortunately doesnt sink into your skin at all. It wipes off extremely easy. I tried everything, i even bought the hydra moisturizer from fenty that's recommended before using this. Still no luck. I also used a brush and sponge. It matched great but oddly sits on top of my skin * I wanted to love this product so much, but it's not great at all. I have to say, it was the oerfect color match for my skin color; First of all, for the price I was expecting much more product. Second, although it glides on very nicely it does not look  like it attaches to my skin whatsoever. The foundation looks like a film on top of my skin. I tried applying it with a brush and with a sponge; it looked the same both ways. Third, it looked streaky. Overall, I'm very disappointed with this product. * Súper light, loved the product affordable * I'm usually a cool to cool beige & this was a perfect match at #2 neutral. I've never been able to perfectly match to any skin tint or foundation. Glides on like butter and is weightless. Great for really hot days!!!"

It sits perfectly on the face and doesn't make it look caked. It feels light and the color covers my blemishes. I love it * A little goes a long way with this foundation. it says medium Coverage but it was full coverage for me. It blends really well and gave a radiant and smooth finish. I'm on the search for my perfect shade because it did go a little to orange for my skin tone. * Excellent product, very good coverage and a matte finish, it is very soft and light on the skin, it came very well packaged, excellent product. Love it * I love everything about the brand... Especially its wide range of shades! This amazing foundation is a buildable one....so summer time wear is a breeze! The finish...for me... Is a soft matte finish also blended with sheer tendencies. Packing is above your ordinary foundation packaging! I'm able to blend this with my fingers my sponges, and my brushes! I think every beauty guru needs a shade of Fenty beauty! Please enjoy this beautiful foundation. Go from light to full coverage vim a matter of seconds. Where there's Fenty, there's room for you! * At first glance the packaging is beautiful, it comes in a nice glass frosted bottle, with a pump. Unfortunately this shade was not right from skin tone, but the formula was absolutely wonderful! For those of you that have combination skin like I do, this is perfect! It gives you a medium coverage and covers up all redness and really sinks into the skin loving a luminous yet not too over the top glowy look. I wore this all day, and I found it really did a great job at night caking up onnny dry patches as well as keeping my oil at bay too. You can use this with a brush or a sponge and I prefer a sponge as it creates that second skin type of look. I highly recommend trying out this foundation and I am going to purchase it my correct shade forsure! * The Fenty Beauty Soft'Lit Foundation in Shade 450 gives a radiant, natural look without greasiness.

I like how it doesn't feel heavy on the skin. As someone with dry skin, this skin tint feels very hydrating and makes my skin look very dewy and glowy. I'd assume that it's definitely a staple product for those colder winter months. It never looks cakey and always sets so beautifully. * This skin tint is a summer favorite! As someone that likes something super lightweight for the summer this has easily become such a staple! It's super lightweight on the skin and has a natural finish! I like that it has a bit glow to the skin and does not feel heavy! It blends out effortlessly into the skin and has a your skin hit better effect! * The #17 shade is a bit darker on my skin but one thing I love about it is the fact that it looks so flawless on my skin. I applied it on my skin and it gave me a flawless finish. The only downside was that it is so hot in Florida right now to the extent that some of it melted off. Do not wear in scorching heat. However, I highly recommend this tint. It gives a flawless effect * The Veil Hydrating Skin Tint is a standout foundation that combines seamless coverage with hydration.

It provides a dewy finish that gives the skin a healthy glow without feeling greasy or heavy. The buildable formula allows for additional coverage where needed, making it versatile for everyday wear or more polished looks. I appreciate how it feels like I'm wearing nothing on my face, yet it provides the perfect amount of coverage. This product has become my go-to for those days when I want a fresh, luminous look with minimal effort. It's ideal for anyone seeking a flawless, natural finish that lasts throughout the day. * bought this yesterday and am already returning it.

I like matte because I have the t-zone sine and this product works great for me * This has been the best makeup foundation I ever used!!! * I have very oily and large pore skin so most foundations tend to melt off or settle into my pores which this one doesnt seem to do so. It can be hard to blend if you put your foundation sparingly at first. One thing i do not like is the smell. It has a weird smell to it and im not sure if maybe i got a bad batch? it goes away after a while and usually im not too sensitive about fragrance but I've never had a foundation smell so strong before from what i can remember. The shades are nice and i got mine in Light 4. It helps hydrate my dehydrated oily skin and any oil that comes through gives me a soft glow. I do like it and would recommend it. * I have pretty much ignored Morphe for the most part- i would walk by their row at my local Ulta and barely give it a glance. Then one day i was just browsing in the store, looking for a new foundation to try and i came across this. I figured I would try it as its well priced, and wow. I can't believe how much i love this foundation. Its so beautiful. I love the color match, they soft matte/natural finish, and it lasts all day. I just bought my second bottle. I like this so much that when their new hydrating foundation came out i bought that right away and i love that one too. I mix them together often and the look is beautiful. I hope this foundation is never discontinued. * Beautiful blurred/filter effect. Medium 13 is my perfect shade match. Long lasting, even in my oily areas where foundation doesnt usually wear well. I have very oily skin and this is my top go to foundation but I wouldn't reccomend for dry skin types. This is a thicker formula so it can be more clingy to dry spots. * My budget got mega tight, so I was on the hunt for a good foundation. I was using Tarte, Clinqiue, etc. I honestly don't know why I bought it. I read the reviews and looked at before/after photos and decided to give it a whirl. I'm so glad I did!! For the price, you cannot beat it! It doesn't smell like cheap foundation. It's creamy and smooth. It seems to stay in place with a good primer (I also touch my face a lot during the day though). It doesn't break out my mid-40s face. It doesn't separate itself or get cake-y. I don't get oily. It's light weight. I'm just impressed!! I think this will be my go-to foundation now. I would go in a store and get matched to a foundation. What I thought I would be online was not what I ended up purchasing...I was slightly on the warmer and darker shade. * I've never used Morphe for foundation, I usually go with a different brand and after not finding my shade in that brand in store, decided to check our Morphe. I was able to color match myself, which I found this one to be a better match than the one i always use. I like how it looks on my skin, it's so light that it's not cakey, and my face doesn't feel heavy with product."

This is the foundation I had been looking for all my adult life. This goes on smooth, doesn't crease or smudge. The only thing is that it can be a little dry but it's not terrible and can hardly notice I just notice the smallest of things but this foundation is my holy grail * I had really high hopes for this one. You would think that there would be ONE high end foundation that can last all day on oily skin. This looks beautiful when you put it on. It blots well. However, touch it once and it rubs right off. It gets very oily. I had spots from my glasses rub off that hadnt with any other foundation. Sooooo disappointed. Oily skin girls need a good foundation too!!! * I love this foundation so much, only one i ever loved this much, and yet distribution center has NONE of the shade i always get, also to those who hate this foundation, you're doing it wrong, you're not suppose to use this foundation with an oil based primer. its going to seperate if you do, because oil and silicone dont go together. ALSO you're suppose to shake it every time before you use it, obviously many people have no reading comprehension skills. * I'm 60 yrs old. Really good. Very pleased. I did have to change the color when I picked it up. Way different. * This is a solid option for someone looking for more a skin tint looking foundation. It is easily applied and does stay put but doesn't cover much. Wore to a funeral and it stayed put and looked nice. * Urban decay makes some solid foundations for oily skin. The Stay Naked foundation is my holy grail… however… the foundation is amazing. 16 hour wear test and when my oils break through its more of a glowy look. I put it on with mu fingers and the finish looked great. I set it with RCMA powder and thr All Nighter setting spray. I will be repurchasing this foundation. Its a bit pricey but im impressed."

This was not it. The coverage is too transparent, so you have to use a lot of get better coverage, and then it doesn't have any staying power. Maybe it's my skin or my primer that doesn't work well with it, but for the price I wasn't impressed. * I have used PUR Cosmetics pressed powder foundation for 5+ years, but it has retinol in it and I'm pregnant. I tried several other brands of powder foundations (Bare Minerals, Lancome, Maybelline) and they all looked so patchy, cakey, and horrible. I tried this as a last-ditch effort, and I'm so glad I did! This is a fantastic pressed powder foundation. It applies easily, doesn't look patchy, doesn't look cakey, doesn't settle into my fine lines, and provides decent light/medium coverage. This has a very nice semi-matte finish, and looks very natural on the skin with a feather-light texture. I will say PUR's product offers a little more coverage in my opinion, but this product is still amazing. I love the ingredients, and I love the refillable compact concept. I highly recommend this! I have combination, acne prone skin and this did not cause breakouts for me. * I originally purchased the kit on the JE website, then came back to Ulta.com to get my refill. This is the only foundation I've ever actually used up!!! I have rosacea and wear glasses, so my tzone does get shiny and requires a small touchup at midday. Some tips:
-use a primer of some kind, either Jane's or another that you like.
-get a retractable travel brush (I use the one from Eco Tools) this is great for touchups and when I need more coverage, I twist the brush only halfway (making it denser) which gives more coverage for my cheeks because I have rosacea. If you need heavy coverage, you are going to want a dense brush to sort of pack it on in downward patting strokes. 
DO NOT swirl/buff...this is not the other mineral powder. different formulas work differently. 
  * This perfectly matches my skin tone. It's very difficult to see when I swab it on my face to see the color.  Nothing  else has ever matched like this. I have been using it for about 8 years. I have normal to dry skin and this gives a natural look. * Initially I didn't like this powder. Was accustomed to fuller coverage powder foundations and i think the shade i chose was a bit light. Decided to use it as a setting powder over a tinted moisturizer because i had a sample of a good tinted moisturizer i wanted to try. I really only wanted to use it up so my money wasn't wasted. This is where i fell in love. It's very good at blurring and I found that it was better than the 100 different setting powders I'd used. I'm a little surprised about the reviews that mentioned cracking because this is the ONLY powder I've ever had in 35 years (in my 50s) that i used completely. Even the little edges stayed in place until they were completely gone. Weird. I can only guess it's because i never bought the hard case to put it in because I initially didn't love it. It stayed in the plastic refill case until ENTIRELY gone. * It does not cover like I'd hoped. I do like the way it goes on with a brush and feels like nothing on my skin. I think the color match is good. But for the price I'm looking for something else that covers my red spots and little veins better. * I love this product. It doesnt break me out and it last all day but the product itself is not durable. Ive only had it for 2 months, hardly using it, and it cracked :( i even used the jane iredale compact made for the pressed powder and still cracked. I love it but the fact that it cracked is not making me want to continue to purchase this product"

Best coverage, color match and longevity. Love everything about it. * its not a full coverage foundation * I have tried many foundations and this will always be my go to. I have acne scars and this covers them and leaves such a glow natural finish. I'm obsessed. * Its patchy, it slides off my skin no matter what setting product i put over it. If you have any kind of lines on your forehead, around your nose, mouth its goong to soak in those lines. Just the worst foundation i have ever bought which is extremely disappointing given the price and brand. * This foundation is top tier. Originally I was a little concerned about the fragrance but its been a few months and I havent broken out (I have ezcema too). It gives the most natural glow but doesnt make you look oily. No one can ever tell I'm wearing foundation when I wear this. The foundation looks best if you exfoliate your skin and use toner + moisturizer. I usually apply with my hands or spatula. I usually blend it out with fingers and/or a beauty blender."

Very hydrating and Dewey. Great for mature skin. * Ive tried this foundation and it looks cakey and crumbled like chalk almost and i do not have dry skin. This was a waste of money for me. * i've always had a really hard time finding foundation that works with my skin. i've tried probably a dozen brands and most of them make my skin look dry and flaky on top of not quite matching my skin tone. decided to give this one a shot and it's almost a perfect match for my skin tone plus it blends so well into my skin. no more flaky, cakey looking mess on my face! the coverage is a little bit light but does the job * I love everything about this foundation!  It goes on smoothly…. no sliding around or creeping into any creases. Color was spot on!  I've used Rodan & Fields for a few years but this foundation beats it all the way.   I feel you can't go wrong with this product!! * At this point, Anastasia BH is aware of the problem with their packaging and still hasn't remedied the problem.  It's a great foundation, but not worth the product leaking and ruining your travel bag.  It's been years...fix it! * Nice product * I love the formula, but twice now I've had these foundations leak simply because the bottle fell over in a drawer. I don't know how you sell foundation for nearly $40 and justify such low quality packaging, but I guess ABH thinks thats good enough."

Great coverage and great application. * I found a great color natch with 22 Light Sand, which as a fair warm olive it can be difficult to find such a good match. It was perfect coverage. A solid medium coverage. It didnt settle into my smile lines, which is a recurring problem for me at 38yo. I did set this with the lightest amount of translucent pressed powder, enough to set down the tackiness, but it stayed dewy looking while not being sticky all day. I'm a fan! * Absolutely love this foundation! Suitable option as a skin tint or buildable foundation coverage. The formula is immaculate! Glowy and radiant finish, leaving my skin feeling smooth & natural. * I have super sensitive skin that reacts very badly to most cosmetics, even the very high end ones. I had been using Lancôme tient idole but they change the formula and I had a nasty reaction. For those of you with sensitive skin like mine, you know how bad it can be as you try to cool the rash and it often times takes days. But I read the reviews about this product and thought I would give it a try. i've been really happy with the results. As one reviewer mentioned you have to shake, shake, shake the bottle to mix the formula. Also, you need only a very small amount. I use my fingers to dab it on them. Blend it with a sponge. I don't need much and it provides lovely coverage and leaves my face feeling fresh all day. If you put on too much, it will feel tacky. But if you use a light hand, I think you will be thrilled. are used the shade match that is on the Ulta app and got a perfect match. I highly recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to many of the products out there.. * My all time favorite light-medium foundation. Matches my skin perfectly and looks very natural. Been using since it came out originally. LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Cant say enough about it. Holds up to heat and humidity and never settles into fine lines * Literally my everyday foundation bc of the  perfect color match and the dewyness 😩😩 * its impossible for me to find foundations that work with my really dry skin. I really liked the tarte brand for their shape tape concealers especially the dewey formula. So when I tried this out, I loved how it had a nice luminous glow and if I applied hydrating primer underneath it, I didnt have the same pilling and peeling that normally comes with most foundations."

i dont usually do reviews but i am obsessed with this tint . i threw away all my foundation. . . 
dewy perfection. * this is one of the best skin tints that offers great flawless coverage!! your face just glows and looks like your skin but better. it's a must have. it does transfer to fingers if you touch your face. use with a great setting spray and if you wear contacts avoid the eye area. I use estee lauder this skin brightening serum is right there with double wear. Definitely a must try. * This may be the worst face profuct ive used in forever. Even with my favorite primer and setting spray, this is so oily. It seperates in a very odd way that i am not used to. You can see every imperfection amplified due to the weird texture. It leaves you with lines and pores you did not even know you had. * I really wanted to like this but I honestly don't. I am combination skin and it makes me extremly oily. It seperates and it smells weird. It shows every fine line and pore. Not for me. * I think if you have dry or normal skin type this is okay but is super heavy for a tint. Definitely wouldng recommend for oily skin, after 3 hours it started fo separate and looked super greasy * This is the first Tula product I've tried, and I might be returning it. I never return things. 
I've been using the BareMinerals Complexion Rescue religiously and decided to switch it up when I saw reviews of this product. Mistake. (Why did I try to fix something not broken?!) 
Anyways, I really disliked how this smells and feels like putting a heavy sunscreen on my face. It does not feel lightweight on my skin, and shows my pores. I have combination skin but it seems to cling to dry spots and does not make it look radiant whatsoever."

This was a patchy, hard to blend mess. Even on my oily skin, it was horrendous. Why fix what wasn't broken? Time to find a new foundation... * I'm 70 years old, and have used this product for many years! First because it made my skin look good when I was younger! Well, now I love it more because it does a great job covering my ""old age spots""!!! I never was into putting on too much make-up, but I ALWAYS make sure I have plenty of this on hand😊 * I have been wearing my old formulae for over 10 yrs . This new formula I cannot seem to find my match at all . My skin looks orange or to light and it just do not look right on my skin . I am in the process of looking into another company because no one could match me * I've used Studio Fix for years and always swore by it. But ever since they switched to this new formula It has made me break out terribly, and it seems to get oily looking so fast now. Unfortunately I am switching to something else completely. Sad day! * Why would they change the formula!! It was perfect before! Now the color doesnt match and its drying!! * I have worn this product for a while thank God they have placed the pump on there. Years ago we had to purchase the pump. I like the location so I don't have to go in mall. Very convenient * Why oh why would MAC take an amazing and classic staple in so many of our lives and completely slaughter it!?!  I can't find the words to truly describe how deeply hurt I am with the reformulation of MAC Studio Fix Fluid!  A foundation that I've wore for 15+ years! If it ain't broke don't fix it!  Just create a completely new makeup but leave the OG alone!  The new foundation is horrific.  I've given it a try TWICE!  It changes colors, oxidizes to a shade that's not true to the skin like the old formula, and gets super oily and cakey really fast.  Ever since this change I've been on a hunt for something else and nothing else compares to the original SFF.  This has rocked so many of our lives, it should be illegal!!"

Im getting this for myself. * Its a good powder, maybe a little cakey if you apply to much. Unfortunately, like many other people, the product shatters after a fee uses * I was so excited to find an affordable option to the Lancôme face powder buuuut I blinked and this compact was in PIECES. I was so confused how the heck that even happened. I came to the reviews and realized it was not just me! Such a bummer. It did give nice coverage for the 2 days it was not shattered. I feel like this was a waste of money. I'll just spend the extra on my Lancôme one. * Never looks cakey, the shade range is great, doesnt make my dry skin look dry, perfect coverage * It's such a bad product. I have oily skin. First of all, it doesn't blend. I tried it with a brush, I tried it with a pad, sponge It doesn't stay on my face, It gives a cakey look * I have gone through few of these bc I like the finish it gives but I can never end up finishing the entire product without the products breaking in to a million pieces and spilling everywhere. Even if I am extremely careful with it the product cracks and then crumbles. I even tried to repair the product and it was a solid piece for maybe 2 days before it cracked again. * This powder is the only makeup product that lasts on my skin without making me look cakey. I use it under my eyes and it covers my dark circles. The coverage surprised me. It lasts all day, even when I get sweaty. All you have to do is swipe the product with the sponge then swipe your face."

For it to work for you, you need to have good skin. In French culture (since this is Chanel), skin care comes first and makeup enhance the beauty. This is exactly what this product is about. If you are looking for coverage, then this is not the product for you. But if you are looking for no-makeup-makeup, then this is it. * This stuff is magic. It's super low coverage and leightweight, yet somehow makes a huge impact on the look and feel of my skin. I have late 30's normal-to-dehydrated fair skin with plenty of freckles and hyperpigmentation. This plumps my skin like crazy, the tiny tint is somehow enough to tone down redness and the finish is flawless, like a filter without looking makeup-y. It's totally undetectable and just looks like you're having a great skin day. Seriously magic and I'm pumped that Ulta now carries it, because it's not cheap and Ulta's rewards are SO much better than any other retailer. I have only two criticisms of this product: it is fragranced with the classic Chanel scent, and the packaging is massive for the volume of product you get. Not at all travel friendly. So when I travel, I bring the complexion touch product, which is very similar but slightly more pigmented. Comes in much more reasonable packaging and is unscented. I do like this product better than the complexion touch, however. Something about it just looks more magical on my skin. It has become my all-time favorite holy grail base product. * Foundations were looking quite funky on my 40-year-old skin and I was needing some thing that mesh well with my new aging skin, and this is absolutely it. It doesn't settle in cracks/crevaces wears beautifully. * I will start by saying that I DESPISE the feeling of foundation. I use to wear full coverage foundation on a daily basis and then stopped for about 2-3 years. This water tint re-introduced me to the foundation world. It's so breathable on my skin and TRULY has the no makeup look (this is my preference). If you're wanting something that's full coverage for blemishes then I wouldn't choose this product. If 
you need it for evening out your skin tone, covering redness, and just overall looking a little more put together lol, then this is the stuff! I apply it with my fingers. I do a cream blush before I apply to have a nice glow peaking through the foundation. Just set it with a translucent powder and ta-daa! * I just tried the Chanel Les Beiges Water-Fresh Tint, and it's amazing! I usually don't wear makeup, but when I do, I keep it minimal with just blush and mascara. Every cosmetic product I've tried in the past felt heavy and uncomfortable. I've been searching for something light that enhances my skin without weighing it down, especially for special occasions and date nights. The Chanel Les Beiges Water-Fresh Tint is a game changer for me. The texture is incredibly light and refreshing, giving my skin a natural, dewy finish that feels like a second skin. The micro-droplet formula blends effortlessly and gives me a radiant, healthy glow without feeling heavy or cakey. It's perfect for achieving a no-makeup makeup look. I highly recommend this luxurious tint for anyone who wants to achieve a flawless, natural look. Five stars all the way!

I've uploaded a photo that I took about an hour after applying. I used no brushes or sponges when applying this. I blended the micro-droplets between my fingers and applied it like a moisturizer. I am honestly shocked at how incredible this product is. The fact that I put no effort into applying it, yet it somehow still turned out flawless, has blown my mind! I can't wait to see how incredible it looks and feels after prepping my skin and applying it with a brush and beauty blender. * I don't normally leave reviews but I absolutely love the product. I was a little hesitant because its a little pricey but its worth it! The color I received was a medium light. At first it looked extremely dark but once I tried it on my face the color blended right in. Its a light coverage which was exactly what I was looking for. I mostly want it to cover the redness I naturally have in my skin and it does just that. I love the product and I would definitely recommend. * I recommend this makeup base, since the look it gives to your skin is natural, healthy and gives a glow. If you are looking for a makeup with hydration and duration, this is the right one. Its price is high, but it is totally worth it."

I have alot if red in my face due to flushing from an illness I have and it covers it up perfectly. I would recommend this product to anyone. It stays put after it's on so you don't have to reapply. * The ranges of darker colors is lacking. The deepest shade was too deep. The shade up, the color i got, oxides to a flat muddy brown. Disappointing, I knew Clinique to have a better selection of deep shades with note complexity. Additionally, this foundation pills when i add a powder on top. * Feels good on skin, clean and no cracks * I have used Clinique make-up and skin care for a long time. This is the worst foundation I've ever used. It made my skin look 10 years older and settled majorly into fine lines.  I seriously looked like a clown! I'm going back to the old Even Better broad spectrum spf15. * This is too drying and chalky.    Bring back Even Better Glow! * I Love tbis foundation a lot I got it because it's dermatologist test and will work well with my rosacea.

It is smooth to apply and easy to use, and perfect for any occasion. It's my go to product. * I was so afraid to try this for so long because the reviews are so polarizing and I have oily acne-prone skin, but I'm so glad I bit the bullet because this is now my favorite foundation. I also use the Danessa Myricks balm foundation, which seems to be similarly picky in terms of requiring a well-moisturized base and using really small amounts of the product. As long as I do that, it produces a long-lasting, incredibly skinlike finish. The only drawback for me compared to the DM balm is that this one does not take mixing well, so I have to apply any glow products directly to my face prior, instead of mixing them together on my hand. * I applied a little bit of this in the morning with a loosely packed brush (swirling it around for even coverage) and the coverage was great! Felt like nothing on my skin. I powdered it down, and went about my long day. 12 hours later (and after sweating a ton) i still had coverage. It had definitely faded a bit by then, but i was impressed. Definitelt not transfer proof, but I havent found a foundation that doesnt transfer. Def powder down. * I've been using Merle Norman for years but the store was closed when I went to get my product. I was helped by the GM of the Greenwood SC location who recommended this product.
Best decision ever. I love it * I got this foundation in likeeee earrly 2023? Came here to right a review about it being terrible for me. Transfers so easy and makes my base look so cakey. * I purchased this product at the recommendation of a consultant at an Ulta store in Maryland. He gave me really great recommendations in the past and I was very hopeful for this product. I told him I was looking for something to help cover a small tattoo during certain events(I work in a corporate environment) derma blend leg and body was out of stock and they also don't have colors for richer skin tones. This is supposed to be nontransferable. Well… It's not. It transferred to my white interior seats to my Tesla truck today. I'm beyond annoyed. Definitely returning and I do NOT recommend."

B00 is PERFECT for anyone who is neutral cool. I have super sensitive and dry skin and I tried this on a whim to see how it would up… I didn't use a primer and it it lasted all day through work without touch-ups. all I used to set was the benefit setting spray and a setting powder. 

PERFECTION * obsessed! * I am convinced that this stuff having as high of a rating as it does is some kind of psychological thing where people subconsciously think it's better than it is because it's Chanel. The shade is fine, but the product never feels like it has actually blended into your skin. It feels like a wet glaze sitting on your face. It therefore runs right off, no matter how much setting spray you use, as soon as you go outside, engage in any sort of activity, or sweat. * This is so worth the money. I've always used Mac since I ever started using makeup but wanted something a little lighter for everyday now in the corporate world but good quality. Now that i'm 29 I'm happy to splurge for quality especially if i'm giving a 16hr days a week. This is worth every penny for newly growing mature skin. * This is the prettiest foundation I've ever put on! It is very natural looking, glowy, and breathable. It doesnt change colors or cake the longer you wear it. It looks the same all night and wears comfortably. It gives light to medium coverage which is my preference in a foundation. Also, although the price tag is steep, I am able to do my full face with a small dot on my beauty blender so I am hopeful that I will be able to make a single bottle last for a while! * First of all, I never write reviews because I am never ""wow'd"" by anything. However, I recently have been trying out so many different foundations, attempting to get the perfect everyday foundation as well as something to wear for my upcoming bridal and wedding events. This foundation is absolutely amazing. It looks like skin and is beyond easy to blend out-barely takes any effort. I got a sample from the ULTA store and am planning on buying the full size. Obsessed! * I have not really loved a Chanel foundation since the original Vitalumiere which I loved. But first they discontinued my shade and then the product itself and I never found anything that compared. I have always struggled with shades in Chanel and they do tend to very greatly from one formula to another. I do not like matte foundation but I also don't prefer something that looks wet or greasy. This product is a great balance. It looks fresh with a lit from within glow. It is comfortable and also quite long wearing. The coverage is light but buildable which is my preference and I was able to get a pretty good shade match. It does have fragrance but it is not overwhelming. I own many high end foundations and skin tints and this has quickly become a favorite. I find myself reaching for it a lot. It just makes my skin look good. I am almost 68 years old so that is saying something. It looks very natural. My skin is very dry but I think this foundation could be used for most skin types and all ages. It's very versatile."

I love that it's customizable with coverage. I can go very sheer and light or I can go glam. 
It also has a built-in primer and infused with skincare. It's a win-win. Please use the brush that is recommended for this product. It gives a absolutely beautiful finish. * This is the best foundation I've ever used! Makes my skin look amazing! I definitely recommend! * This stuff is great! It covers all of my dark spots & imperfections like nothing I've ever used. I feel like I have pores u can see from space & it has the best coverage. I've struggled for years to find foundation like this & I am so happy I took a chance on this one. 
I love the airbrush finish it gives my complextion too. Worth every penny! * This has been my HOLY GRAIL foundation for so many years and suddenly they stopprd making my shade!! LP1. Ive been scouring the internet to find one. I cant find any foundation even close tl how lerfect thosmone was.  I dont understand why they stopped just this ONE shade. * I love this product , great coverage without being to heavy . * I was issued wrong color. I'm very upset. It was in the box when I ari Ed home color to light. We checked at store and it looked fine * honestly really so skin like but w coverage & good applicator"

Was looking for a dupe for discontinued The Ordinary Serum foundation, but this is too heavy. Good for more ""made up"" look IMO. Don't love how the pump works. * One of my HG foundations! I have the shade Vallauris and it blends effortlessly with medium buildable coverage. It looks natural and has a natural finish that isn't too dewy. I have combo oily acne-prone skin and it lasts all day. It doesn't break me out. Try it! * Perfect product!I don't think ill buy any other foundation. no other foundation would compare.will be using this product forever.goes so nicely on the skin and stays all days.Good coverage for every day looks and special occasions.defiently would buy this ASAP. * This foundation is great but I can only use it in the summer because there is no shade light enough for winter me. The shade I use for summer is pushing it. It's pretty dark but so beautiful on. Please make a greater shade range! Thank you! * I love this product but it comes open sometimes and it is way too expensive to receive an empty bottle. * I love this foundation, it matches my skin color and tone very well (I am very fair with cool undertones got the color ""Oslo""). I have been looking for a foundation that has good coverage, but doesn't feel heavy. It is a great foundation that you can ""build."" This is a great match for me. I have worn it for hours and it doesn't feel cakey, or heavy. It feels natural. I'm so happy I was able to try this product. * So this foundation is extremely hyped and I do think it's pretty, but i had to change my routine up to get any meaningful wear out of it. I know some people don't believe in the whole water based and silicone debate but i had to get a water based primer because it was separating with silicone.
It also doesn't really hold up to all day wear in my opinion, especially in warmer weather. On the NARS website it says you can pair with radiant Creamy Concealer but that has silicone so i noticed it would separate around my undereyes as well when i did that. I would say it's fine for like a date night or family gathering but not too sure about clubbing or all day wear. I will probably get radiant longwear next because it's silicone based and has a specified wear time of 12 hours, this one does not"

Its not even that it doesnt have the coverage (i wasnt looking for that) just that healthy glow fresh face look that Cc cream gave me… i will keep it and use it because it does feel nice, smells like chanel and has spf … but I wont buy it again ever. * After 40, most foundations accentuate every sign of aging, until now. The finish is perfection and lasts all day - no caking, creasing or dry patches. My skin never feels dry, just comfortable. I only wish that there were more cool shades available. * Feels so comfortable, coverage is light with a beautiful finish!  Love this product. * Used la roche tinted sunscreen instead. 42 was too dark on me. Will be returning * I bought this on a whim just to try, and I was pleasantly surprised! The first time I tried it I was in a rush, so I actually used my fingers to apply it! The coverage was matte, and smooth! It covered up all my redness in one smooth pass! I love the flawless, light coverage. It's perfect for those no makeup makeup days! I am a mom, so some days I don't have a lot of time to get ready and this gives me that sense of security. I'm definitely impressed with this foundation. The price can be a little bit hefty, but that's what comes with a luxury product! All in all, I will keep this on hand and repurchase as I run out ! * I love the way this foundation looks on my skin. The coverage is light to medium. It blends beautifully, lasts all day and I love it. I would recommend this to everyone. * Seriously, I have tried nearly 30 brands and this is light and covers so beautiful. It has SPF and makes my skin look so healthy and glowy. I am in my 40s and still have oily skin and some dry patches of skin. It doesn't sit on top, it really looks like fresh gorgeous skin."

If u have those issues then spot conceal before applying this. it works great, ive been using for 3 years now. i get so many compliments on my skin. natural looking, evens out complexion, breathable. do your normal skin routine, with gel moisterizer for the dry skin girlies, then apply this! chefs kiss!!! * This is an incredible complexion product, it gives you such gorgeous plush hydrated skin for dry/combo skin, it's amazing. I can't use regular foundation on my forehead bc it's so dry, so I only wear this everyday and it's perfect. If you have any kind of lines, texture, etc this will help hydrate your skin and make it look soooo good. The coverage is medium, you can definitely just wear this as a foundation if you build it up or add concealer. This is the only tinted moisturizer that doesn't smell, doesn't leave patchiness or streaks and actually lasts because there's a primer built in. You can literally use it as a primer AND tinted moisturizer. Phenomenal product and always a repurchase. I have the full size at home and the mini one in my car. * There is no coverage. Very dissatisfying * if you have very dry skin or patches, don't walk, run to get this. for the people that didn't like that it goes too yellow or oxides get the neutral shade. I am Medium neutral and it was perfect for me. normally I use this as an actual foundation and when I need more staying power, I normally just apply my Nars Naturally Radiant longwear in the places I want it to last the most. But as long as you have a great setting powder and setting spray it should be ok. advice when you put this on wait for it to dry down. at least 10 minutes, is you find it too dewy, just take a toilet paper and pad slightly on the face to remove any excess. * I tried this two years ago, and have never found a tinted moisturizer to compare. It has a beautiful glowy finish, and is really hydrating for those with dryer skin. I love!!! * I love halo I've been using it for years. is really hard to find things that work on my skin cause I have extremely sensitive skin.  But this works for me.beautiful finish! * I think a lot of ppl dont think anout this brand a lot bc its not ""trending"". But its such a great TM. It makes my skin look better. It doesnt look like i have a layer of cake on. It evens out my complexion, adding a glow but nothing like a tin man-ish.  This is def an over looked product. It wears for hours wo looking patchy, separated. I cant say enough great things about this!"

I've tried sooo many other foundations like fenty, hause labs, makeup forever, and too faced and always went back to eeste lauder even though it emphasized my skin texture. I love this foundation! It melts into the skin, has a beautiful finish, and is buildable. It's what I wanted hause labs to be except it's not super oily. When combined with the setting powder it looks like a real life filter. * I'm over 50 and this is the best foundation I've tried so far. Non drying, doesnt cake, buildable  coverage but the pump on the bottle broke after a week and the shape of the bottle makes it hard to get the product out. * Bought this with high hopes seeing everyone be so beautfiul. Not worth hype feels like normal forndation. Doesn't cover much even with layering. I have some acne scariing and it shows through. I try not to wear foundation that is heavy so at least rhat part was ok. But mot the holy grail eveeyone keeps saying it is. * I was hoping the hype for this product was true and it is! * As an oily skin girly, my go to is normally Estee Lauder Double Wear or the new UD. This hasnt lasted all day on my skin and has been COMPLETELY matte. I used the PS powder w it. Stayed more matte than either of my reuglar foundations do! * As an esthetician that focuses on natural, non-toxic ingredients this foundation was a GOD SEND! It works wonderfully on all skin types, not cakey at all, and I love that it's buildable. 

I've seen a lot of negative reviews just because the pump has broken for people…I don't understand that. Just unscrew it and use a brush or spatula to get it out. Not a reason to dock the rating all the way to 1 star. I highly recommend this!! * I never leave reviews but had to for this. I've tried every foundation on the market, even the $100+ ones but this is the BEST one I have tried!! It is full coverage, smoothing/blurring, AND good for you ingredients! I use this and their loose powder and it looks like i have a filter on. Probably the only foundation and powder i will use from now on"

Glides on easily even over dry and patchy skin. Does not settle into fine lines.  Once set with powder it and stays put, in dry or humidity climate. Feels light, true with the serum claim. Has added skin protection and benefits. Did not irritate my sensitive complextion. The 0 and 1 colors matched well on my  pale neutral skin tone. * This color was a perfect match for my skin tone, which isn't always easy to find. I liked that it had spf just to up my coverage in the summer. However it has a thick and sticky texture that is hard to apply. I tried using my fingers without success coverage was splotchy and showed a lot of texture. Same problem when applying with a brush. Better coverage, but the coverage broke up halfway theough the day, additionally the texture was awful. I dont have any acne scarring or fine lines or wrinkles where texture was visible. * This is a great lightweight serum foundation for the skin just not for those who wants a natural matte look. I have oily to dry skin. I never realized i had dry patches until I used this product. It applied beautifully but within the hour i noticed it cling and accentuate dry patches. * I recently left Estee Lauder and tried a few other makeup brands, but this serum pulled me back. Im so happy i got this! It is perfect! Good coverage but light too! You wont be disappointed! I an 56 and this is great for my imperfections! * My skin has changed so much in my 40's and an Ester Lauder/Ulta rep tried this on me and all I could say was wow. Very luminous. The rep used a dry sponge but at home I use a wet sponge and it glides on and really improves the look of my skin. * Feels so good on my skin so much lighter than the doulbe wear. * I decided to purchase this since I love the full coverage foundation but was looking for a lighter coverage eveyday. I used the same shade for the full coverage and noticed this one did run slightly darker. However, its not that bad- so I kept it. I do finish it with setting powder and it looks nice. Haven't had any issues with it so far and I use it daily for work."

The finish is beautiful and it lasts all day without drying me out. Sometimes i mix this with the Filter Effect foundation from Morphe and it comes out amazing. Try this! * This stuff really covers! I use my hands to blend, then a brush, THEN a sponge for any excess. Hydrating, a little glowy, def needs to be set but i set everything. Would recommend!! * I really wish the shade match was correct I was excited to try this👎🏽 * Wouldn't and didn't blend. Patchy. * Prefer Estee Lauder makeup * It's perfect for everyday use. I have dey skin and this is amazing for it. I do use Estee Lauder for a special occasion or a night out but for my everyday makeup this is perfect. * I really liked this foundation when I put it on. It delt nice, and it looked nice for a bit! But almost instantly I noticed seperation and its hard to blend because it doesn't seem to want to stick. Ive tried different moisturizers and primers, and nothing fixes it unfortunately."

The doible wear is great for oily skin but i needed something light coverage and matte at the same time. I needed something to wear to work everyday. Unfortunately, my oily skin pertruded after a two hours snd i had to pat down my skin. So i recommend if you have you combo skin but for oily skin not necessarily. * I'm on the fence. Love the finish very natural. Doesn't settle in lines and wrinkles. Very runny and thin seems to take a lot of product to produce a full face coverage.  My 70yo skin on nose is breaking out a bit and this is only new product I am using so I'm just not sure  will keep trying * I really enjoy using this foundation. It is so lightweight, a perfect color match, and wears nicely throughout the day. It doesnt get overly oily/shiny in my T-zone where I experience that the most. Minimal setting into my fine lines and wrinkles - even less when I prep with a primer. 

I highly recommend! * I have dry skin and the regular estee lauder foundation wasnt for me. However, this one worked well. It's lightweight and still covers the small red and dark spots but I would not recommend it to someone looking for a full coverage. * For reference, I have fair warm toned, moderately oily skin. I usually wear 1.05 in Smashbox Studio Skin, and NC15 in MAC Waterweight. I wear 1n2 Ecru in this foundation. I love love this foundation. It is beautiful on, smooth, light coverage. I don't have a lot of dark spots or acne issues. I do have freckles and some redness, but not crazy. This coverage is perfect for me for daily wear. It plays with my other products. I don't get weird grainy break down around my nose, chin, and under my glasses at the bridge of my nose like I do with other foundations. It will last my 16 hour day and still look great, no fading or disappearing act. If you need full coverage, you can skip this one but if you just need an even out with a natural look, this is your girl. I thought Fenty EZ Dropz were the best thing ever until I tried this foundation, and now I won't touch the EZ Dropz again. * I go to a huge college in the South where it is often above 100 degrees outside, and I will wear this to football games and sit out in the direct sunlight and sweat for hours and it still looks just as good post game as when I put it on! I love this product and swear by it! It is expensive but I think it is worth the price. My only complaint is that I think they could give you a little more product for the price point, but the product itself is just so great I won't stop buying it! * Im so happy I found this product. It has truly changed the way i use make up. It such a lightweight foundation with light coverage like a tinted moisturizer, but its buildable like a foundation?! Its crazy. The vitamin E in it keeps it hydrating even tho is like a semi-matte kinda like how skin naturally is. And the fact that i can wear this to a concert, the beach, the gym, or out on the town completely unset (by any powder) and be sweating, or just going about my day and its will still look as amazing as it did when I applied it. This is a holy grail, must have babes."

No mayter how i applied it, whether with a brush, besuty blender, or both, it woukd seperate and look cakey on my face. Wanted to love it, but ifs a no for me * Great coverage, blends easily and doesnt look cakey. * I wore this CC cream for an indoor/outdoor event I was working yestersay and it was very humid and warm at times. My makeup never moved theoughout the day and I received several compliments. * Let me start off by saying everyone is different. We all have different skin types and different skin issues. I tend to have clear combination skin. I use hydrating products because they tend to sit better on my skin and have less cracking and flaking problems. Also, I love e.l.f….most products I try by them I absoluetly love. I was using their hydrating camo concealer as a foundation for the longest time because it was perfect for my skin. I decided to try someone new and bought this cc cream. I regret ever buying this product. It applies nicely but after 10 minutes it starts becoming cracked and splotchy. It looks absolutely horrible!!!! I was really hoping this would be closer to the concealer that I love and cherish but this cc cream is anything but. Even though its supposed to be hydrating its very dry and the sunscreen in the cream burns and irritates my eyes. I hate to say it but this is the first product by e.l.f I will NOT be repurchasing! * This foundation is a no for me. Im a 48 year old woman with combination skin. I purchased tan 415c, great color match. Putting it on its like paste, very thick and tacky. A little goes a long way but it pulls your skin during application its so tacky. Full coverage but easily transfers until you try to take it off. Takes some serious washing to remive it all. No pilling or seperation. By end of day face is a greasy mess even after blotting throughout the day. * I really like the finish and SPF aspects of this CC cream but it doesn't really seem to last throughout the day. If i use it i always take it with me for touch ups. I'm becoming weary of complexion products that claim longwearing without specifying how long. * I use this as a foundation and it covers my acne scars. Looks really good on skin im obsessed. Definitely worth trying"

I mean, i absolutely adored this foundation. It made my skin look flawless. I like to try new foundations so i didnt buy it for a few years til April 2024. That tube was fantastic. My aunt said my skin looked flawless & that i should never stray asay from this foundation bc it looked great on me. Well i bought a new tube in July and i got a different shade bc i had developed some color from summer sun. Well this new tube is GARBAGE. I absolutely hate it. It looks awful on me. Idk what is going on but i will not be repuraching because i dont like inconsistency with my makeup. * Finally! < angles singing> A lightweight tint that hydrates, covers and doesn't look like makeup!!! All without caking, creasing or accentuating dry patches. It takes about 60 seconds to set and lasts all day. I do wish that there were additional shades, especially for cool shades. Orange and peach are warm shades, so a truer cool shade would be heavenly.  Thst said, I'll be repurchasing. * Love it * The struggle with summer acne has been real, especially under a full face of foundation. After sweating on a hot day, I'm constantly battling clusters of little zits where the sweat gathers, specifically where my sunglasses sit on my cheeks. I started looking for a tinted moisturizer and every single one I came across had incredibly mixed reviews, but a large number complained of streaky application or little to no coverage. I finally stumbled across this one and the reviews were also mixed, a couple even saying it dried their skin out (weird for a moisturizer, right?). However, several reviews indicated that the coverage was actually pretty good, so I took the plunge. The shade match was pretty impressive considering there isn't many shades per skin tone. My first time using it, it went on so smooth, felt like I had nothing on, and gave a great medium coverage. 
I have dry skin, so the reviews claiming it dried them out had me concerned, but it did anything but. Maybe the people claiming that just didn't skin prep? Over the past few days, I've put it to work. I've gone out in the rain, I've worked up a sweat.. this stuff did not budge. I even braved a sweltering porta potty on a hot day (iykyk) and came out pouring sweat and it STILL looked good. Best part? No breakouts! How? Seriously how? This is now my holy grail for summer foundation. Obviously what works for me isn't always going to work for everyone, but my advice is definitely give this one a try if you're looking for a lightweight foundation that brings the coverage. * Im very picky with my foundations since i have dry sensitive skin with fine lines but this foundation is beautiful on my skin. The finish is a bit dewy but not greasy and can be powdered for a more shine free finish. It stays all day in the hot summer Arizona heat. It covers my melasma and hyperpigmentation. It can be built up for more coverage. It plays well with other products cream or dry or liquid. I enjoy using this foundation. It is also a perfect color match. I will repurchase and highly recommend trying it. * Every single foundation shows my dry patches except this one, I love it!! * Not like most tinted moisturizers. Heavy formula like a foundation. Pills over everything. Dries quickly."

It looked so skin like, it was very hydrating and wore wonderfully, but when i washed it off at the end of the day i saw all fungal acne it gave me on my forehead and around my mouth. Im sure this is beautiful on more mature skin, but if youre acne prone steer clear. * Ive always loved makeup, a full face. But when my skin starts to flake and my foundation is dry, i hate it. I wanted to stop wearing makeup completely until i tried this product. She's perfect!! No seperating, doesnt dry me out, she's flawless for 9+ hours. (I have always skin prepped so that wasnt my issue) i set with the laura m ultra blurring translucent power, chefs kiss. If you have dry skin, this product is game changing. * Dry skin girl here…great foundation for me!! Medium coverage, nice glowy finish. If you have oily skin, skip this one. Doesnt settle in pores. I do set with mac mineralize powder, setting this foundation makes a huge difference to me. With powder I get around 10-12 hours wear. Recommend for anyone with dry and/or mature skin!! * I've had acne and redness my whole adult life (39 yrs old); I've tried so many foundations but this one is my absolute favorite. A small amount provides great medium coverage, it stays in place, blends well, and gives my pores am airbrushed look. * I bougth it for fhe SPF but toure better off getting an SPf moserizer. This peels on the face and doesnt sit well on the face. I wojld t recommed :( * Over priced. You can get better tinted BB at the drugstore"

I don't find it luminous at all; a natural finish at best. I enjoy it more if I add a little oil when applying. It's a solid medium coverage but almost leans slightly matte to me. I had a very difficult time finding the right shade. There really wasn't a great match for me but BD21 was acceptable. I have the same shade in the Healthy Glow foundation but the shade differs with the formula. I like the Healthy Glow better as it looks more natural and it's less expensive. Still on the fence about this one. Might not be glowy enough for me. * Products gives great coverage while still feeling light on your skin. * Love this smoothing long wear foundation! * This is my second time purchasing this foundation.  I love it! Even at 56, my skin is still oily.  This foundation is not too heavy and does not break out my skin.  My only complaint is the bottle.  When I reached the end, I could not unscrew the top to get out the remaining foundation. * This foundation is thick not great if your looking for a quick application so for this one you have to work and set it. 
I have oiky skin it enhanced my pores. Returning * This was a splurge but it's one if the only clean ingredient foundation that I've found that has coverage without being drying. * Best foundation on thr market, hands down! Period! Money well spent, i love this product"

The new formula is HORRIBLE. It makes my skin look worse than if I don't wear foundation at all. It's dry, streaky and the color closest to the one I used for Studio Skin makes me look like a Dorito. I switched over to Estee Lauder now because I found a great new foundation there. Bye bye, Smashbox. * I have been searching for a long wear foundation for my oily skin that holds up in the summer heat and looks great as an everyday work foundation. I  bfe tried so many foundations and many high end, I am allergic to sunscreen and most foundations melt off me in the heat. This is it! It looks great, gives me great medium coverage and i can build it up if needed or im having a rough skin day. The color is a great match and I haven't stopped wearing it since I got it. I highly recommend! * Really stays on all day and during/after workouts. Doesnt dry out my skin. I have acne prone skin and doesnt make me break out. * I was very happy with this foundation, and it is among the best foundations I have ever used. I have found what I was looking for in a foundation. * I'm a ""try-er"" of all things makeup, so when I had a chance to get this at 50% off, I bought 2 different shades to try,  F10-C and F20-C (which was a little too dark for me). I prepped my clean face with the Fenty Pro Filt'R True Matte primer and then touched up some red areas of my face with the Pur 4-in-1 Redness Reducer Correcting Primer. After letting that dry, I went for it with a dry sponge. I chose color F10-C and it covered well, and not extremely thick. I powdered my face the new Glamlite Bake & Set Translucent powder. My face was matte with zero shininess coming though at all for the entire day! I live in south Texas where the humidity makes you sweat and ""glisten"" just sitting there! I did sweat, but there were zero streaks in my makeup! That's pretty much a first in my book! My skin didn't feel tight like it does when I put on all mattifying products. It felt good. Natural. I would recommend trying this foundation for any skin type. Just make sure you use a primer for your skin type. * It is by far the best foundation for me. The only downside is since they change their formula its hard to find my match but I make work."

It is my every day makeup go to. Just a few drops and you are covered! * This foundation is TERRIBLE. It aged me at least 10 years (i took photos that showed fine lines that I didnt know I had).

The only pros to this is the shade match was spot on, and it didn't feel like I was wearing anything on my skin. * Easy buildable coverage . Leaves my skin glowy but not an oily finish * This skin tint is the best foundation/skin tint I have ever used and I've tried it all. From luxury and prestige brands to drug store brands, I've tried so many. I still try new things but I always go back to this one. I have pretty oily skin and EVERYTHING ends up seperating and getting cakey on me. NOT THIS!!! I wear this everyday for about 12 hours a day and it still looks amazing when I wash it off at night. I hooe Maybeline never discontinues this bc it is my all time favorite and I will use it for as long as they make it!! I recommend this to everyone I know!! * This feels like powder mixed with water. I like how it is thin, but it did dry out my skin and started to look flaky within an hour. * Very nice full to medium coverage tint easy to blend and work with * I absolutely love this foundation! It feels so light weight but definitely buildable. If you want more sheer coverage use alot less! 
If you have combo/ oily skin you will love this! I wore it from 1pm to 1am and omg i was shook! My skin looked amazing i hardly had to touch it up! Made my skin look and feel good. I did get a shade too dark but i made it work ☺️"

I really liked the coverage and consistency. It was extremely lightweight and super blendable even with the coverage being a medium rate. Oddly enough, it didn't fully dry. I dont like the heavy feel of makeup on my face so having to add a powder for the foundation to set in place was a turn off for me. I also tried my best (along with an employee) to match to my skintone but still had this orange look im the end. * This foundation has the ability to provide that no-makeup look! It's got an amazing shade range & a natural, flawless finish. It's perfect for evening my skin tone on days where I have more redness, dark spots, under-eye bags & blemishes.

I set on top of the liquid foundation version of this or any other cream/liquid foundation I own. I've set with a sponge, a powder pouf, a brush and the cheap sponge it comess with but it doesn't actually set. I use a huge amount and set for a while too, but my skin still feels wet to the touch after i tried setting with this powder.

I was really nervous purchasing this one (and not just for the price, although it's not inexpensive) because 1, there wasn't a single YouTube review about it (even from my favorite Dior-loving, Ulta -loving ones) and 2, I was matched with a very different shade than in my Backstage color (0.5 in Backstage, I was recommended 1.5 in this formula). Without any photos of anyone who looked much like me, I put my trust in the ""shade finder"" guide and bought it with some of my Ulta rewards points.  Now I'm going to have to cough up the $$$ when I need to replace it because it's my favorite foundation ever! It's got light-to-medium coverage that I want, it blurs my texture (fine lines, pores and wrinkles) while it moisturizes just enough and leaves a pretty, natural glow to my skin (not shimmer, certainly not glitter... just the glow of youth and vitality that tends to dim a bit with age). And one to one and a half pumps does my whole face (I don't have a petite face either lol) which makes me confident a bottle will last awhile. This foundation makes me feel good about how my 50+ skin looks and the shade match is chef's kiss perfection. I've stopped looking at any other foundation... this one is my new Holy Grail! * It's just enough coverage * LOVE.  See comments anove.  Worth the price.  A little goes a little goes a ling way. * Love this natural nude foundation.
it's a perfect coverage. I still love forever matte and the Glow Foundation but this one has a unique texture and quality that works very well on my skin.  I recommend it 100% thank you Dior. * I will start by saying this is a very nice, lightweight foundation. It has almost a water light feel on the skin and never has that mask-y feel (for someone with sensory issues this was a huge plus!). The color is a nice match and it does not oxidize at all. If you are looking for that ""glass skin"" effect, this will give it to you. The coverage is sheer to medium but I personally would not call this buildable  like the description says. 

Now the cons:

While I wanted to love this foundation, after a few wears it just left me underwhelmed. It still had a very nice skin like appearance but it didn't cover my acne or dark spots and did nothing to smooth my skin or blur pores. By hour 8 it had kind of settled and disappeared into my skin. Another bummer for me is the fact it has no SPF so I now have to find another product just to layer with it. Overall nice product but not for me * I just ordered and have worn it three times now and am hooked. It goes on beautifully, it has a smell but dissipates quickly. It does not oxidize like other high end foundations I have. I even got a massage and it lasted through my face on a massage table pillow. I can wear all day and not have to blot, I have an oily T-zone. It held up through hot and humid weather of the south eastern part of the country. * Overall this is a good foundation. It gives decent coverage and lasts well when properly set with powder. But, it's not good enough for the price tag. I have many more foundations that perform just as well or better for less money."

I even purchased the recommended brush to apply! The issue is the ""hard pan"" it gets after just one use. The first one did the same thing,  I had to scrape it off to be able to use the product, this second one only half the surface of the powder has the hard pan problem. Unfortunately,  at the cost of the powder and the it takes to dig it out each time, I'll go back to using the shape tape pressed powder."

Gonna stick with my too faced * Beautiful satin foundation!
Not too matte and not too dewy. 
It's very runny so all I need is one pump. It blends easily with a brush or sponge. It feels light weight and doesn't crease in my smile lines. I pair it with the Too Faced BTW concealer. Shade matching was easy, I wear shade M21 which is a perfect neutral. I recommend this foundation to anyone willing to splurge. * Over the past year and a half, I have been on the journey to find a foundation that doesnt transfer, is very longwearing, and doesnt settle into my smile lines. I have tried close to 20 foundations, and none come close to this one. It is the BEST foundation i have ever tried! Buildable coverage too. Ive never gotten more compliments on my skin! A forever repurchase. * I normally love Pat McGrath makeup, and find it to be worth the price. However, I can't say the same for the foundation. I've tried applying it with different brushes/sponges, with/without primers, and/or setting sprays. No matter what I do, it doesn't wear well on my skin. First off, it's quite runny. It applies patchy/streaky, so I feel like I realy have to work with it. Then, within a short amount of time it begins to settle into any lines and separate, especially around my nose. I definitely won't be purchasing this again. * I went through bottles of other foundations, high end and drugstore before I came across this one. I got it as a sample first. I thought just try it out, see how it goes and fell in love with it. It glided perfectly onto my skin, so lightweight and blended naturally. It doesn't settle into my fine lines or wrinkles and feels like I am wearing nothing on my skin. I don't like heavy foundations or makeup on my skin, so this was perfect.

I do not enjoy the feeling of foundation and generally find few of them perform well and look flattering. For fair skin, this was a perfect match to my winter shade. I have never found a more accurate color. It is very matte but has a slight radiance to it. I have drier skin, so I have to do a lot of skin prep prior to applying (typically toner, Glow Recipe dew drops, moisturizer and primer) and I finish with the Hourglass Vanish setting powder. After that, it is long-wearing, oil-controlling (in T zone) and does not move. I only wish it were more dewy, but that is my only complaint about an otherwise flawless foundation. * I really like this foundation, it lasts what it promises and my skin looks radiant and you should keep in mind that it depends on how you look at the skin the foundation looks like I love it it is worth the price my color is 7.5 * I was searching for a new foundation because I always buy the ones from drugstores, so I got help from one of the associates from the stores and after trying 3 high end brands, i picked this because of the glow that gives and it does a really good coverage without looking thick, it's lightweight and it blends so goooood, I'd definitely recommend this if you're trying to get a new foundation * I wanted to like this foundation but it creased and accented every wrinkle and dry patch!

I will buy this forever! * I really didn't know how this would look on me, I usually use more silicone based foundation so... But this one was very nice. I did have to put it on the back of my hand and give a little mix first then apply it to my face. I tried pumping it directly on my skin and it didn't blend right.. This foundation is definitely not beginner friendly.  I'm sure everyone is different but this is the best method for me. Also I have dry, mature, skin. It wore nicely for about 4 hours. After that I needed a touch up. But it's definitely a nice light coverage!! * This stuff is the definition of ""your skin but better."" I've tried SO many tinted serums, wasted so much money on $40+ brands for them to be useless. I've found the easiest way to apply this is directly to your face, then blend with fingers, then blend out with a beauty blender. 

I have sensitive skin and rosacea, this is the first product I've ever used that didn't irritate or break out my skin. And weirdly, despite having pretty light coverage, this does an amazing job at covering my redness. Covering actually might not be the right word, it's more like toning almost. It doesn't look like I have anything on, yet still seems to almost eliminate my redness (which has always been severe). I have no clue how this works, I swear it's magic because  I cannot understand it. 

Coverage is somewhat buildable, but definitely meant to be used lightly. It'll get cakey if you set it with powder, and then if it gets wet it'll lift really weird, but I don't ever feel the need to use powder. Powder blush and brozer work fine over it, just not setting your whole face. I'll go all day just with this and not get oily at all, it doesn't slide off like other tinted serums, and when it does wear it looks really natural. A bit sticky at first but it will dry down, and feels like there's nothing on your face! Definitely is somewhat waterproof, by far the most oit of any other product like this I've tried. 

I've worn this to bed many times without any breakouts, and in the morning I truly can't tell whether there's any of it left on my face (in a good way), because my skin looks better after wearing this. Probably the bakuchiol, which is what prompted me to buy it bc I already use a serum with that every night that I love. 

And again, I don't have great skin to begin with, and I've gotten endless compliments on my skin since I started using this. People saying my rosacea looks better, pores, texture, etc. 

I don't bother with reviews much, but man, every time I use this stuff, every time I look in the mirror I can't stop thinking how good my skin looks, and how natural. * The first few times I used this I thought it looked beautiful on the skin when first applied. But noticed after being on my skin for a little bit my skin felt tight. I should have looked at the ingredients first. Benzyl Alcohol is pretty high on the list of ingredients. unfortunately, it makes my already dry skin drier. * I've used this a few times and have been loving it on my no makeup makeup days when I don't want a full coverage base. I get hormonal acne along my chin so it tends to leave acne scars, so this doesn't fully cover them up but it still gives a natural finish. 

It leaves my skin looking healthy, covers my spider veins, provides light coverage under my eyes in place of concealer, and gives me an all around healthy glow. 

I do 2 pumps and rub it between my hands first then spread evenly onto my face before using a brush to buff it out. I recommend this if you're starting out with makeup or if you prefer a natural finish. * This is so beautiful if you mix it in your hands first, apply with fingers and finish with a sponge. It's so skinlike and lasts all day for me. However— why did they put bakuchiol in it 😭 I didn't think it would be that noticeable but I can't wear this everyday or else it starts stinging. Such a shame because I love how it looks and want to wear it everyday! I wish brands would keep makeup and skincare separate. * I LOVE this so much. At first it took a minute to figure out how to apply it. 
First I blend it with my fingers until the water is blended, then i take a sponge or brunsh and tap to smooth the coverage. 

For me, a normal / dry skin girlie this is perfect for daily wear. Better than a lot of high end foundations that Ive tried."

I love this foundation it feels like your skin , great colors to match your skin! * Nice coverage but very oily * I really wanted to like this foundation, but I just don't. I have mainly normal type skin, with an oily patch around my nose. When I wear this foundation, I get an oil POOL around my nose. After a few hours, my skin just doesn't have the same coverage :( * don't buy it if you break out easily or if you have oily skin * I love this foundation and for me it never seems to break me out it's light weight and has just the right amount of coverage!! Would buy over and over again!! * it's so smooth & fresh! * This product clogs up my pores so much and not only that it makes my pored look bigger. it is not full coverage and its is so cakey. after like 45 mins of wearing it it turns orange and wears off. it creases horribly and I would not recommend this product if they payed me to do it.

I don't normally like wearing liquid foundation because it feels heavy but this one is so light and actually does provide good coverage without the heaviness. I have plenty of acne scars and discoloration and it makes my skin appear almost flawless - basically solid coverage without feeling like full coverage heavy foundation. I don't even need to wear concealer under my eyes or elsewhere when I use this. I like to apply it by squeezing a few lines onto each area of my face directly from the tube and then work it in with a brush. I go back in with a dab of liquid bronzer to give my face dimension. If I have time I'll let it dry 5-10 min and set very lightly by pushing in some setting powder. It ends up with a nice dewy finish but if you go heavier on the setting powder you can get closer to matte if that's what you like. Lastly, I wear the ivory shade which works in combination with the bronzer but would otherwise be too pale (I'm a 2N1 in Estee Lauder powder in winter and 2N2 in summer). I just ordered the golden ivory in this product for summer but again, with bronzer the ivory still works for me all year. * I wanted to love this! It goes on very smoothly, which is great. But I wouldn't say it is buildable because it's so oily it never dries enough for a second coat—if you wanted. About 2pm I look so oily bc my powder has dissolved. I tried it about a month and kept wondering why my face was always shiny—and felt oily. I thought it was new moisturizer but it's not. It's this. If you have dry skin—this would be perfect! * I can't believe how great this product is at such a reasonable price point. My skin is very dry and  so most foundations were settling into my fine lines or emphasizing scaliness. This foundation does not do that and it is incredibly hydrating. I like natural coverage and this does that perfectly but I think it could be buildable, too. I find that it does transfer pretty easily but I think that's the trade-off for it being so moisturizing. I just a put a little powder to set it and that seems to help. * This product did not work for me. I am 43 with combination skin seeking a foundation with spf. It felt amd looked very shiny. I live in Florida and need something long wear and humidity proof. I am a fan of L'Oreal just not this one. * I dont like yhat everything had nucinimide its so irritating for mt skin :( * This product is just okay. Application is great, easy to blend and definitely buildable. I started with just one layer first with my fingers but it didn't blend well so went in with a brush. I may try again with a beauty blender because the brush wasn't bad but it was trying to cling to texture and dry patches. It wore well around my pores (not well in fine lines!!) until i tried to do a touch up. It just moved everything and removed the base completely. I would recommend embracing any texture or oil because you can't touch this foundation up dyrung the day. * So I bought this to try and replace my IT CC because of the white cast that always shows up on my skin. Unfortunately, for my skin tone, the white cast on this product was worse. I loved the way it felt going on, and it was even. I apply with my fingers, and still achieve the even look. it's just my chin is a little darker so any white is noticeable. I had to use more bronzer to minimize it than when I use my CC. it didn't irritate my skin and I wore it all day. I am trying the Infallible Foundation because I really want something sweat proof, with less SPF to minimize the white cast."

Over the past year this has become a daily favorite, the coverage is on point and has a beautiful finish but still feels so light weight on the skin! Whenever i wear it i am given a complement on my skin and asked what i am wearing. I showed my friend this foundation and she bought it on the spot, she now wears it everyday too! We also showed her mom and she loved it too it! This is an amazing full coverage formula that is perfect for everyone! * This is the BEST full coverage foundation, its very light weight and almost undetectable on your skin! While still giving the full coverage you dream about. * This foundation is very creamy and I get so much compliments when I wear it! It's definitely long wear and even after I sweat and have been put all day my foundation is still on and looks amazing! * loooove this! i use 1/2 a pump (of light 8nw) on my combo/oily skin and its so beautifully full coverage, while still looking like skin!! 

just want to preface, go in person and test it on yourself, it was difficult to find my shade online! * I have searched forever to find a shade for me for foundation. And all the ones I have tried have been too orange ,but now that I found this one I dont need to find another brand even with the price it is worth it to not look orange."

Literally, this is magic.  Evens tone, covets flaws, smooths every textural flaw, diminishes pores, seems to moisturize any dry patches, and feels like I'm wearing no makeup.  It's absolute must-try for anyone over 50yo and doesn't love the typical look of foundation. Yes, I'm ordering a backup. * I tried the Water Fresh Tint when it first came out and didn't like it at all. There was absolutely no coverage. This though, is what i was hoping for with the tint. The Complexion Touch is so good. It's beautiful on the skin and has a light to light medium coverage, and it feels like nothing on the skin. Don't use the brush that comes with it to apply because its way too small, however I've found that its a really good concealer brush. My only gripe with this foundation is that you go through it pretty fast. Im already halfway through my second bottle and this stuff is pricey. But it's totally worth it. * Love it, it's moisturizing without getting too oily, wears light on the face and doesn't look cakey. Easy to throw in the purse. * Just not for me. It feels heavy and greasy. I couldn't stand it. * I have tried different bases and no matter what base I use, this pills awful! Rubs off as I'm applying. Have tried with a brush and using fingers. Try another Chanel product. * I loved this foundation, is super light weight and easy to blend. It keeps my skin hydrated and looks natural. A little goes a long way. Perfect for winter when my skin is dry * This is obe of my favorite foundations for days when i font gave breakouts but i need to look pulled together ot my skin needs a boost. I apply with fluffy buffer type brush and it evens my skin tone and leaves it looking plump and juicy. I'm 51 and my skin type leans drier, with redness and some dark circles.

However, as Ive been getting older, i do find i need to mix it with other foundations to keep it from settling into fine lines and wrinkles. It can easily make me look drier and more mature. I think its perfect for anyone with normal to oily who doesnt need to worry about aged skin at this time in their life. * I love this, it's very matte so just be aware of that. The coverage is amazing. Its lightweight and buildable.  It's so velvety and looks like skin. I will continue buying this. * Best full coverage * I'm a medium cool neutral skin tone with oily combination skin - 540 Giza.
I layer usually with additional contouring darker shades to warm up my skin tone and add more dimension, but it's very light, minimual layering, as I do not like to wear anything heavy.

This foundation is awesome! I L O V E it because of how much a little goes a long way. I tend to prep my skin with moisturizer and primer for smoother application. I tend to apply light layers, which may be way this product has lasted so long for me - I do not like thick layers, nor do I feel that I need to layer so much of the product to get decent coverage. It has a nice mattifying effect, but does not accentuate lines or cause any unflattering crepe-y undereye area. If you're looking for something ""glowy"" or something of a pearlescent finish like a CC cream or tinted moisturizer, this may not be for you - it is quite mattifying, and despite my light handed application (like I mentioned earlier, a little goes a long time), it does offer good coverage without the cake-on effect. 

In pictures, it helps my face look more even and helps with my shiny t-zone area. 

I got these when they were 50% off, and had purchased 2. I know my first tube I'm currently on is nowhere close to being out, but I do wear foundation only on special occasions. 

I live in hot humid Texas, and have yet to experience any breakout with this product. * It gave me extremly bad breakouts it was patchy it would cling to dry areas and accentuate texture/pores it rubs off throughout the day * I constantly get compliments on my beautiful skin and I don't even have a skin care regimen aside from washing my face and regular lotion. I love their shade range since even more expensive brands get deeper shades wrong."

It's a moderate amount of coverage, but seems buildable if you need more. So happy I gave this a try! * I love this, just turned 30 and skin is changing, dry combo skin, and have been trying new foundations the last couple years. Estee lauder hydra rescue foundation was my main go-to. I tried about face and liked it, but its heavy and transfers easily. Nars felt too orange and heavy and the bottle leaks. Ilia serum foundation is greasy and bare minimum coverage with a steange smell but feels good for my skin once it sinks in. Clinique even better serum foundation was also decent but this is is. Goes on smooth and easyoly sets with primer/powder. Good coverage. Feels light. I hope this sticks around for awhile. The shade match was wrong as most are for me as im fair with some freckles and rosacea so I recommend going 1-2 shades lighter, and then you can always blend it easier with bronzer/concealer to get perfect match. * I am shocked thus stuff isnt viral. It has a gorgeous natural matte finish that can be built up or done lightly depending on your preference. I am 42 with combo skin and large pores; this definitely minimizes my pores and blends seamlessly with the shape tape concealer. * Great coverage - very smooth and cloud like * Not a natural finish. This looks like you are wearing heavy makeup. It accentuates pores and peach fuzz-even with primers. The color I ordered (16B) seemed off. I honestly thought I received the wrong color because it was so dark and orange. I have 20B shape tape concealer that I compared side by side with this product on my skin, and the 20B looks way lighter and cooler compared to this in 16B. I have used their foundcealer in 16B in the past and it was a decent match. So good luck finding a match with the color inconsistency of this product! * I love this CC cream! Idk how it hasnt gone viral. One layer evens out my skin. I apply a little more or shape tape concealer where i want extra coverage. This is definitely not a full coverage foundation, but for those of you who are looking for the perfect every day coverage this is it! I have combination skin and this is great on both my dry and oily spots. The only con I have is that it does expire quickly * I love the way it covers my spots and matches perfect."

I will just add additional drops on those darker spots, which still peek through but look more homogenous. But coverage is not my main concern, so this winner maintains the slightly dewy glow over a well -prepped skin base, still looking un made-up by the end of the day. Also, goes over mineral sunscreen flawlessly. IMO it is on par with Haus Labs, Nars Radiant LIght, MUF reboot; my other favs. I am trying another shade, though am happy with Katey, the match I found via the skin models- so that's my recommendation for finding your shade, rather than the description. It is on sale, so... TRY IT! * I'm assuming this foundation is on clearance because of quality issues… I received my order and the formula is completely separated and cannot be mixed back together to a good consistency. * I was so surprised when i first used it, my skin looked like skin. I like a lightweight natiral finish and this gives me exactly that! It also stays on all day/night, only thing is that it oxidizes a little bit but not wnything drastic. Has been my go-to foundation for over a year already! * good match for hard shade (fair/light olive) and good for sensitive/acne prone/scar/texture skin. decent coverage but feels light and natural. but doesnt really set (makeup smudges on my cat) & taking the top off pulls the entire pump out sometimes * I have used this foundation for a few years and it's never let me down. I fluctuate between a range of their lighter, cool toned shades depending on the time of year. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. A few things I've learned along the way: 

*A thin base layer will cover most spots and uneven tones. If you need more coverage, then spot treat with a little more foundation.
*It pairs beautifully on top of Nudestix tinted sunscreen.
*Applies well with brushes or sponges, but better with your fingers.
*A stippling, dabbing motion is the best method to apply the thin layers.

I'm 41, and I receive many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation, and I feel like I look more youthful with this on. I will definitely continue to repurchase! * I wish I liked this product! I have combo skin and have been searching for a foundation that works for my skin. 
I've tried countless brands. This one seemed to never set, it stayed moist the entire time unless I put powder over it. I've tried several primers and setting powders and light face powders. Of coarse all at separate times. I spaced it out too. I tried each primer a few weeks time to rally give it a chance. I feel the liquid eyeshadow in this brand is the same way. This foundation bottle also leaked and I was wiping it before and after every use."

I'm in my mid-40's and my skin, which used to be combination to oily and prone to acne, changed to normal to dry. So, I changed my beauty routine and make-up products to adjust. I read great reviews about this one so I gave it a chance but no matter how I applied it, it will become patchy after an hour and completely peeling after that. I tried to use my fingers (by warming it up), a brush, a sponge, with and without primer and it never worked. It might work for some but not for me... * Completely terrible, very oily. I applied foundation this morning and it looked like I would have lathered baby oil on my face. I tried to shake it thinking it was separated but it sounds like water. * I dot this around my face and bounce a damp Beauty Blender to even the application. It is really pretty. It reflects a lot of light.  It feels really good on the skin. I would not count on more thsn 8-10 hours wear. Fingertip or brush applications did not work for me.  It would not look good beyond light medium coverage. * Really wanted to love this as I love Bareminerals and the fact that it is 93% skincare. Also found my perfect shade However started getting breakouts everytime I used it * First. Its a must shake product. So shake shake shake…. Shake shake shake. The first time you have to shake forever but if you do it you have zero run in the liquid. Apply with fingers and you get exactly as advertised and one pump. I like my beauty blender so i get a more raident sheer coverage. I used fingers to warm product and press in skin for makeup photo that i want a more medium coverage. Lets face it. Im 38 and not 20. Less becomes more and i have dry cheeks and oily t zone. This makes me glow and vibrant without creasing. Now i did build this up and enough of any product will eventually crease which it did. Again im closer to 40. But for acne prone and combination skin i truly love this. The shake shake shake can be tiresome when im just trying to get this on quick but no skipping this step. Shake shake shake and one solid drop gives me what im looking for. If i may add i hate using my fingers but seriously best for medium coverage and this is exactly what BE claims it to be. So my new love * I like the old formula so much better!! This just sits on your skin and feels greasy! My skin did not like this make up! I broke out in red dots. I will be returning it. * I bought this hoping it would be like the Bare Minerals Skin Brightening serum foundation from a few years ago that was discontinued, but sadly, it's not. I miss the old version. The Pure Serum Radiant Foundation is extremely runny if you don't shake the bottle A LOT (almost to the point of exhaustion) before use. It would help if mixing beads were in the bottle like they were in the previous Skin Brightening Serum. If you shake the bottle thoroughly, the foundation will be a creamy consistency that blends nicely and wears well all day. If you don't shake it thoroughly, the foundation will be very runny and will look oily on your skin and won't stay on long. I was ready to return it at first, but once I figured out that I need to shake the bottle excessively, I liked it much better. I would buy it again (now that i know the trick), but please … add some mixing beads to the bottle and consider switching to a plastic bottle (like the old serum was in). I'll never understand why products are discontinued, only to be brought back with a new name or altered version that's never as good as the one that was discontinued."

I understand its a skin tint but has zero coverage. Separating on my nose and chin and will cling on to dry spots. 0/10 recommend * Left a rash after being on my skin for 2 minutes. The burning started and I washed it off immediately, and this is what I was left with. There is virtually no coverage. Buy a tinted sunscreen, or a better skin tint like the one from Ilia. * Should have taken the reviews seriously… If I had kept the box it would be returned…. It is a watery mess… There is a chemical odor… And the color is off…probably due to the consistency… I used the previous version of this product for years…and am extremely disappointed with this ""new and improved"" version of the product…. Nothing stays the same… What was wrong with old Tinted Moisturizer that it needed to be changed…watered down…? This was a total waste of money… this tinted moisturizer will go down drain where it belongs…! (Don't set the tube in the upright position on the cap…it will be a mess when opened…) * At first glance this seemed promising but about only and hour the product caked and separated on my skin, this isnt the worst part. It gave me a severe reaction, im now walking around with a painful rash on my face. I will be returning this. * Just a skin tint, has lots of fragrance in it. * I love this for a ""no makeup"" glow. I waited 20 min after my skin care and applied using my fingers. I was so happy it went on flawlessly and blended so nicely. Truly looks like my skin but better. It feels hydrating and lightweight, and lasted all day without creasing. Love it! * Greasy, patchy, never sets. Maybe user error, maybe i didnt have proper prep, but i tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. Never worked for me once. Such a shame because it was a perfect shade match and i wanted it to work so bad."

It was SO BAD. I was excited because they have a great range for pale shades, but after wearing it for a bit it oxidized SO bad and I looked orange. It also went on cakey and dry, and gave me almost no coverage when applied with a brush. It felt hard to blend. Not recommended. * This compact is a game changer! It blends perfectly with my skin and gives a flawless finish!! * I tried the Juvia's Place powder foundation for everyday office wear, when I need to get ready in a hurry. It is good, smooth, blurs pores and is buildable. Available in a wide range of shades too! Good buy for the price. * It oxidezes but i went down two shades and works fine. Its affordable and gets the job done. I use it as a finishing powder. It blurs and keeps makeup in place. Is not drying. * As someone with dryer skin this product does not make my face feel dry. It blurs my pores and gives me a flawless base. Not to mention the great shade range!"

Unfortunately the moment i put it on my skin the color was immediately to warm for my complexion, i got the heavenly honey. It looked WAY to orange and when i washed it off it looked like pure orange on my skin. It showed every ounce of texture on my skin (i dont have much texture) and sunk into every pore. Would not recommend at all. * Wanted a stick foundation for a light everyday makeup look. This is perfect! I use about 3 swipes on both sides of my face to even out my complexion. Blends best with a damp sponge followed by a foundation brush. Also love the neutral undertones!! * Love using this have been doing this now for 5 years. Have not been disappointed. * I finally found a stick foundation that matches my skin so well.  I put it directly on my skin after moisturizing and pat it in with a make up sponge.   Using a press shine eliminator my be helpful for oiler skin.  I love this foundation and I will be purchasing it again. * I came in hoping to get what I usually used but my shade was not in stock.

Also is not shade inclusive for lighter skin. I am light skinned and not fair and the couple of shades are horrible. * I didn't expect to love this product this much.

My skin leans very dry and I have a good amount of texture. This foundation has been a pleasant surprise! Idk if it's because my skin is more dry that this foundation naturally compliments it. 8.5/10 * I love that it's a natural skin like texture but the coverage is full and bendable. The smell does smell nice but could be a concern for someone with sensitive skin and could cause irritation. I have oily skin so when trying this I did realize I had to reapply powder throughout the day a couple of times. * Ive been using this foundation since last year and now its my go to, i would recommend if you need a natural finish, breathable, amd buildable foundation. Also the shade martinique is the best fitting for my skin tone that ive ever found. * This has been one of the only foundations that I have ever tried that doesn't oxidize! This foundation has cherries in it which can be really good for the skin that also gives it an amazing scent. The foundation is a thick consistency but doesn't feel heavy and doesn't cake up. Since I have skin just like everyone else obviously no product will ever completely cover up skins imperfections but for someone who has bigger pores and oilly skin I feel like it minimizes them and covers up acne well without clinging to them and my dry patches on my nose. The foundation stays on all day long and my skin has never looked better. Overall this is the best foundation I have tried the shade range is amazing as someone who is really pale I always have a hard time finding a foundation that isn't orange, won't oxidize bad, and is light enough. Obviously juvias caters towards darker skin tones but I still love this brand! The shade ranges are amazing and all of the products are so pigmented! Even if you don't buy this foundation I would definitely but their eyeshadow or something and support this black owned brand! The best affordable products out there comes from here! thanks juvias. * This is the first and last foundation I'll use and easy to find skin tone because of diversity * I bought this  because I love the original matte formula but i always mix it with other foundations because it can be drying on me.  I thought if i could just get my shade (Cebu) in the luminous it would be the a perfect match to the original, but its not.It also oxidizes on me terribly if i wear it alone. The pump is also just nonfunctional- but thats not a dealbreaker . I do it use it semi-regularly to mix it with other foundations and I love the watermelon scent that it has but it will not be a repurchase for me."

Goes on smooth, stay put and hides imperfections.  This is my second purchase of #14 (Expresso). * Decided to try this after Ulta Adjustable Powder Foundation was out of most colors for literally WEEKS, in-store and online. This works very well on me for everyday use, and seeing that it's about a third the regular price of the ULTA brand (which I can't get anyway), I will buy again * The smell is so atrocious I dont even remember anything good about this product, it doesnt go away even after 3 hours🤮 * I use this as a setting powder most days because I live in a humid climate, and the days I want something light it works beautifully. However, the scent is SO overwhelming. It's like walking into a nursing home and a perfumery all at once. The smell does not dissipate either after wearing it, it stays pretty strong throughout most of the day. * Great coverage * Poor coverage but if I had gotten the correct shade I think I would have been pleased"

I still haven't gotten to trying the MAC one, but this Milani foundation is incredible and is a lot better than I expected! It's medium to full coverage, looks super natural but flawless on the skin, and is actually less greasy/shiny than most of my liquid foundations which us surprising for a cream. It does set to a satin, powdery finish, and wears beautifully with a touch of powder on top if you have more oily skin like I do. Also, the shades Warm Beige and Sand Beige have really nice neutral-yellow undertones that can match many medium complexions very well! Definitely happy I found my new favorite, easy to apply foundation! This is a lot less messy and quick to apply than liquid foundations, which I love! A brush or a sponge will work equally as great with this stuff and look flawless :) Definitely recommend it! Thanks, Milani!! < 3 * This is very inexpensive and lasts longer than Estee Lauder all day foundation. I didn't have a bald spot on my nose like Estee Lauder at the end of the day. The shineyness at the end of the day was minimal and I have oily T-zone, combo skin. It didn't crease in my fine lines or accentuate my pores. Mac and Estee Lauder powder foundations both did this and were oily right away. I used Laura Mercier primer and Urban Decay setting spray. I use a beauty blender sponge to apply. Milani worked better than more expensive brands. Just try it! Use finishing powder to set before spraying your face. * this is the first powder foundation i have tried and im never going back to liquid foundation. * After hearibg all the amazing things about this foundation I wanted to love it. I've had such a hard time trying to grab enough product to evenly blend out. I've used my fingers, foundation brush, flat foundation brush, beauty blender, etc. now it just feels like the foundation is dried out and pretty useless at this point. * would think shade range wouldn't be an issue anymore with any brand. they either don't go dark enough or don't go light enough. or if they do, they only offer 1 undertone which doesn't work either. * I love Milano but this was a no for me."

I loved the creamy texture and mid coverage. Perfect! * this is a tinted moisterizer not a foundation for the people saying it doesn't cover dark spots or pimples. If u have those issues then spot conceal before applying this. it works great, ive been using for 3 years now. i get so many compliments on my skin. natural looking, evens out complexion, breathable. do your normal skin routine, with gel moisterizer for the dry skin girlies, then apply this! chefs kiss!!! * This is an incredible complexion product, it gives you such gorgeous plush hydrated skin for dry/combo skin, it's amazing. I can't use regular foundation on my forehead bc it's so dry, so I only wear this everyday and it's perfect. If you have any kind of lines, texture, etc this will help hydrate your skin and make it look soooo good. The coverage is medium, you can definitely just wear this as a foundation if you build it up or add concealer. This is the only tinted moisturizer that doesn't smell, doesn't leave patchiness or streaks and actually lasts because there's a primer built in. You can literally use it as a primer AND tinted moisturizer. Phenomenal product and always a repurchase. I have the full size at home and the mini one in my car. * There is no coverage. Very dissatisfying * if you have very dry skin or patches, don't walk, run to get this. for the people that didn't like that it goes too yellow or oxides get the neutral shade. I am Medium neutral and it was perfect for me. normally I use this as an actual foundation and when I need more staying power, I normally just apply my Nars Naturally Radiant longwear in the places I want it to last the most. But as long as you have a great setting powder and setting spray it should be ok. advice when you put this on wait for it to dry down. at least 10 minutes, is you find it too dewy, just take a toilet paper and pad slightly on the face to remove any excess. * I tried this two years ago, and have never found a tinted moisturizer to compare. It has a beautiful glowy finish, and is really hydrating for those with dryer skin. I love!!! * I love halo I've been using it for years. is really hard to find things that work on my skin cause I have extremely sensitive skin.  But this works for me.beautiful finish!"

Great formula, repurchased multiple times. * Okay but it leaks bad. * Very cakey but amazing coverage * It's a smeary mess after 2 hours. I wanted to like this. The color matched my skin, no matter how I prime it or what powder I use, it just looks bad on the skin after an hour or two. It looks smeary and doesn't blend well, sits on top of the skin. Wouldn't recommend. * This is one of the worst foundations ive ever used. To start, the bottle is frosted and there are no testers so trying to find a shade match that is even somewhat close is nearly impossible. Second, it smells like paint. Usually scent doesnt bother me but this was very noticeable. It was also extremely thick. I even added water like some reveiws say to do to thin it out and while it helped some, it wasnt enough to save it. Similar to the smell, this just looks like paint when applied. It doesnt blend well and excentuates every small bump or crease. Even with settjng powder and spray it feels oddly tacky and doesnt look like skin at all. It just sits on top like a thick layer of paint. The wear is also horrible. It breaks up in strange places that I have never had issues with before. It rubs off at the slightest touch. It all together just looks like a cakey mess.  Do not get this foundation. * Love this foundation and Ulta sells out of my shade often.  I'm olive, tan and this is the closest most perfect shade match in a foundation that I have found that's full coverage.  Nice thick consistency but not too thick.  Matte finish. * I use this product as my everyday wear to work. Definitely worth the price, great coverage. With a setting spray and primer it last all day."

Coverage is not very good either. It's very thin and extremely oily. Usually I do like their other products but this is definitely not it. I have tried it both with primer and without. Neither way lasted all day as it just essentially slid off. * the coverage on this is amazing you can wear on it's own and leaves a beautiful glow but if you have oily skin like me i don't recommend, you'll look a mess lol * I had extremely high hopes for this product. I read all the reviews watched the YouTube videos and was ready to go.  First I tried the shade Punta Cana (5) and it was too dark. Then I went back and got the shady Giza (6) and it was too late, so I decided to mix both of them together, hoping it would balance out. I don't understand how a product can have so much pigment but no coverage if that makes sense.  The product is highly pigmented and when you put it on, you can clearly see there's makeup on your face however, I have a few blemishesthat it provided coverage 0 coverage for.  It didn't matter how much product I went back and dabbed on the blemishes still no coverage. I even let it sit and dry down hoping that would thicken it up but still no coverage.  Also, it was not glowing or dewy for me. I looked straight up Greasy, even with just the first layer, I looked sweaty like I had been out in the sun. It was not a flattering look. I even tried powdering it down, but it just looked greasy with powder on top which basically turned cakey and even with all that I could still see my blemishes through.  I purchased this this evening and I will be returning it immediately when the store opens tomorrow.  I love Juvia's Places' products and I will still continue to support and purchase, but this just didn't work for me.  Buyer beware. * I tried this thanks to a friend who has it and gave me a 'sample' (thank you, girlfriend!).  I must say, yes, it's better than the ones by e.l.f. and Charlotte Tilbury.  You can use it alone for a subtle glow and coverage, or mixed with your foundation (for the same effect).  Looks great either way.  I'm planning on getting a bottle for myself.  I do recommend it. * Elf Halo Glow broke me out and I never was able to try the Flawless Filter by CT but I dont think I need to because I discovered this and I LOVEEEE it. Perfect under foundation or just by itself. Gives me a perfect glow without making me look greasy * I bought this to try out since I couldnt justify spending $$ on charlotte tilbury. I love this formula & finish!! I couldve color matched better if I bought in person vs online, but the shade i got still works for my dry skin. Defintely going to be using this during Summer * From the color to the way it applies and blends, it's the best thing I've experienced in a while and I will be getting more shades.

Color match was great and does not oxidize, but that's where the pros ended for me. Definitely not full coverage, didn't blend well and shifts/splotchy. If you're an oilslick like me… this is a total waste. Maybe good for dryer skin? Going back to Dior at this price point and won't be purchasing this one again. * This foundation brought out texture and wrinkles I have never seen before. It is not very blend-able, as it takes a lot of manipulation to look somewhat acceptable. This product is very drying and I have oily skin. Not to mention it does not adhere to the skin, it slips and sides off your face throughout the day leaving you patchy. * I finally found my holy grail foundation, I didn't even buy it at Ulta but that's how much I loved it to write a review. It feels like I'm wearing nothing, it matches my skin perfectly which has been a nightmare for years trying to find a good match. * This coverage is a lot more sheer and dewy than I had anticipated. This would be a beautiful foundation for someone with dry, mature skin since it does not crease. The colors are not accurate either. I suggest ordering one to two shades darker. * I need to keep looking. I have a full bottle that I hope to find someone that it works for. * I was so disappointed in this product because I had been saving to buy it for such a long time and when I used it, it melted off and had to use a lot of setting powder to keep it in place somewhat!!

I know my undertone and have been able to pinpoint my exact color profile, so it's not that. Foundation usually sits on top of my face, amplifies my fine lines, and makes me look like a hot mess. Age Perfect Tinted Balm is the only foundation that makes me look better, and I wish I knew about it sooner. It's my favorite! * I have what the skincare industry refers to as ""mature ""skin. I am a make junkie and I had many foundations from drugstores and major department stores but as I got older they all made me look cake and settled into lines. I stumbled on this product and I love it. It's my skin only better. It lasts almost all day on my  combination oily dry skin. It is a wonderful product with light medium coverage for mature skin. Will definitely buy again * I've used 3 pots of this now and I'm still somehow surprised by how nice it is. The formula feels like it won't cover much, but it softens the appearance of/seems to fill and even out pores, scars, wrinkles, or any textures--I often get compliments on how smooth my skin looks when I use this. I've gone back and forth between two colors because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the color match is a little difficult. All in all, I keep trying new foundations just to come back to this one and be impressed by it. * I'm a light-medium skin tone that leans towards cool. I got started on this because an influencer raved about it a few yrs. ago. I decided to try it and couldn't had been more thrilled. I use shade fair 20 for reference. In the pot it looks more like a peach shade. It glides on effortlessly and melts into my skin. My dry/mature skin looks healthy. I'm sure I will get tired of this foundation, but for the last 3 yrs. I've been pleased. Only time will tell. * I was very skeptical to try this and was shocked. It is so good. 47 year old combo skin, apply with real techniques dense brush and its better than high end. How is this not more popular? * I have never really worn foundation, I have tried occasionally but it just isn't me. I bought this on a whim since it is different than traditional foundation. My face gets a little shiny after applying sunscreen, which is never good. I apply this with a foundation brush around my eyes and the sides of my nose. It hides the shine and evens the skin tone while still looking natural. * I really liked this foundation except that the fairest shade was very orange on me, even with my summer tan."

I hope they'll carry the newer HG skin tint so I can try that one. * Im 55 and my skin is very dry, this product is moisturizing and never settles in my pores , an excellent alternative to foundation which just sat on my skin, this tinted moisturizer does not do that. I would highly recommend this product- * I have never had so many compliments about my skin since using this tinted moisturizer! It may not be for anyone needing full coverage makeup but someone looking for a glow and slight coverage! * It was very hard to find something for my aging skin that is full coverage, but doesn't settle into lines and look caked on. this was recommended in store and I absolutely love it! I apply with a beauty blender and use shape tape concealer with a tiny bit of setting powder. Really makes a difference being hyaluronic and any pictures while wearing come out great. A must in my drawer. * I wanted to like this. I have dry skin and some creepiness at 52. This made all of that worse.

It's very thick and kinda hard to blend out even with moisturizer and primer. 
I had to return this and buy the Too Faced brand hydrating liquid foundation. * Several comments said this was medium to full coverage which made me want to try it and it is not. There is absolutely no coverage at all. If anything it's just a glorified moisturizer so I'm thinking those other comments were for a different product. * Absolutely one of my favorite foundation.

Although I love their products, I have always been ""ehh"" about their packaging....until now! Thanks for finally giving up the gaudy gold (sorry, Jane Iredale) and going with this new, modern and aesthetically pleasing line of packaging. Since I have several of the old gold compacts, including the gold metals ones, I ordered one of the new compacts to see how I would like it. After receiving the new compact, I cannot wait to replace ALL my older versions! 

One more suggestion... in your future development, please consider making your eye shadows available in refills. I love the idea of being kinder to our planet and saving on the excess packaging. I do not mind paying separately for the cases if I know if is making a smaller, greener impact for future generations. =)

One final note of thanks to Ulta...I have been begging my local store to start carrying Jane Iredale. I am glad to see that you are at least finally carrying this amazing, clean line of makeup online! * I bought this on sale and I'm glad I did. It just makes it nice to put your foundation in. For the price of the foundation, it's a shame you have to purchase compact separately. * This packaging is overpriced and by default should be included with the powder. Waste of money."

This foundation is SO NICE!! It is more like a skin tint than a foundation, which I prefer if I do ever wear it, the smell is relaxing (if you're not an essential oil person I wouldn't recommend, the lavender is pretty strong), and it doesn't feel like anything is on. For my Florida girls this stuff is a great quick fix for the hot and humid days!! * I have super sensitive, rosacea-prone skin & my eyes are really easily irritated by makeup (ocular rosace) that started a few years ago - suddenly I couldn't wear my favorite makeup without breaking out, & my eyes burning, bright red. I searched & finally found a brand specifically for rosacea-prone skin! So happy to be able to wear makeup again! Over the last year or so the formula clearly changed - I couldn't find a color match & then my eyes started to  burn again. Back to the search - finally found this - I love this foundation & the whole product line! It's light & looks great - as others have said, I look like myself, only better! It doesn't settle in my lines or pores, doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It does feel a bit oily / has a bit of shine. Also, Nude 3 is a perfect color match for me when it goes on, but it does darken a bit across the day so I'm going to try 2.5 & save 3 for the summer. Otherwise, highly recommend!! * I bought this foundation and love it.  I'm 47 years old with dry and pigmented skin from aging and I like light coverage products due to aging skin look more natural than full coverage foundation.  Very moisturizing.  I still set with loose powder and yes would buy this as long as nudestix still made this. * I got this product in shades light3 it a good tinted moisturizer with light to medium at most.  Great for dry skin.  Love this product. * Flawless and lightweight. I'm in love. * im telling you right now GET THIS. the PERFECT natural foundation that isnt too sheer or too high coverage. also the single foundation i have that is my true shade!!!! i can blend this out so well even w my hands which i cant typically w other foundations and it blends out BEAUTIFULLY. funny thing is i bought this on mistake,, was trying out concealer and wanted to buy it but accidentally picked this up instead. BEST MISTAKE EVER!!!! WALK DONT RUN TO UR ULTA 4 THIS IM SO FR * Used to be a full coverage girly … this changed the game for me, i was skeptical, but it's so smooth, the tiny container has lasted so long. Its just good, its worth it."

I used to use MAC and like this much better after trying a bunch of different brands. I have very sensitive skin and no problems. I have been using this for years now and I am very happy with it. It goes on smooth and it buildable to a good medium coverage. * This was my first time trying this make up brand and I a now a fan! Makeup is lightweight and comfortable to the skin. Is  100% true to skin match and buildable coverage, and also holds well in heat! * Run run RUN to get this foundation!!! I cant say enough good things about it! It gives such a radiant, skin like finish and doesnt feel heavy or greasy. Plus, the shades come in differnt formulas, depending on the shade range!!! * This is my 4th time buying this foundation and they changed the formula! It has a watery, runny consistency, whereas before it was a thicker consistency. The new formula still works just as well as the old one! Coverage is buildable without looking cakey (just make sure to blend with a damp sponge). I have rosacea and red acne marks & it covers flawlessly and still looks like my skin. 

I also have combo skin. I find this foundation to hydrate and also not accentuate my oils that i produce throughout the day. It's a perfect soft matte finish. * I get compliments whenever I wear this. it's a really good, light on the skin, natural finish foundation, but somehow still manages to have good coverage. It's very easy to blend into the skin, and wears great across the day. My absolute favorite thing about it though is that it has the best shade range and undertone range I've experienced. I'm a pale olive which is very hard to find foundation for, but this looks amazing on me. * This foundation of the game changer, so long wearing I work 10 to 12 hour days and it does not budge crack or flake. This is a Serum foundation so it is very watery but the coverage is absolutely amazing. I have never seen a Foundation blur the way this does. I have been mixing this foundation with the Youthforia primer for light days this combo makes it into a radiant tinted moisturizer. * I really like this foundation. It is on the watery side and you have to work fast with it. However it is buildable with coverage. They have a great shade range and blends into the skin smoothly."

Its my go to during the summer months. * Medium to full coverage. I like to carry it in my bag for touch ups because it covers the redness around the nose, i can cover up some my blemishes that peak out after wearing makeup all day etc * I use the shade Natural and I absolutely love this powder. i've used mine all the way to the pan and just restocked a new one. Literally the most beautiful blurring coverage, doesn't feel cakey or drying and my skin looks flawless. Great for on the go and quick touch ups. I usually hate the feeling of wearing heavy foundations and powders so once I found this it was over. Super breathable and comfortable and evens out my skin tone in a couple quick pass overs. I love this product. * Medium to high coverage, smoothing, non-comedogenic. Its a bit hard to shade match. I use Soft Tan in this powder and Nars Valencia, Lisa Eldridge 19, Estee Lauder 4w1. * This was my favorite foundation for everyday wear until recently. It is the best color match I've found and so easy to use. However, as others have stated, my last two orders have fallen apart into unusable powder within a few uses. Super bummed. * I've used this for a couple of years always carrying one in my purse. My last 3 have broken easily. The last one within a week!
Otherwise I like the product itself but once it breaks it's harder to use, and inconvenient. * I love this powder foundation because it was acrually a full coverage foundation. I do have combo skin so my t zone would get oily, but not enough to stop using this. I even had 2 other friends try it, but the biggest issue me and my friends had which is why I will no longer get it is because it cracks so easily. My friend received hers broken, then me and mt orher friends wasn't broken at first then after a few uses when we openes oirs it compeltely crumbled and cracked and made a huge mess. Maybe the formula changed?"

It does not settle in my lines; it actually plumps my skin (hyaluronic acid 🙌🏻🩵👏🏻🤩) and gives a flawless finish. I also have extremely sensitive skin and my face does not react to this at all. It seems a lot of brands are now incorporating good skincare ingredients in foundations and this one is a winner! 🥇🙌🏻👏🏻 * Went tried on my arm but ,when I put on face was way to dark for it.
But this is my first time ever using anything on my face so I'm  learning baby steps. * I'm over 50, have fair, neutral, combination skin with especially dry cheeks, redness, and texture. This foundation seemed to cover the redness fine but it faded within about 2 hours of wear. It settled in my fine lines and looked, for lack of a better word, gritty. No fragrance but does have an unpleasant chemical smell. It's a no for me. (Not Revlon's fault but the color-finding function led me to 117 Light Beige, which was the right depth level but pulled warm on me.) * the most skinlike finish of any drugstore product I've ever found. it has good coverage, wears comfortably on the skin, and doesn't crease or transfer if you set and prep correctly. it feels like the $50-$70 foundations i used to wear and the price is unbeatable. 10/10 * What an incredible skin loving foundation. After 2 weeks of using I'm noticing a more even skin tone, my fine lines are disappearing, and my skin feels nourished. I love this for spring/ summer! I prefer it without primer as I notice I get the most benefit that way. I do set with a non-talc powder and Milani setting spray. It truly looks like skin if you get the right shade! * When set properly, this foundation lasts all day, looks like skin, and never cakes or clings to dry patches. It looks and feels expensive on the skin, and I'd pick this over my Lancome for coverage anyway. It can be a bit too dewy if you don't do proper skin prep, but with the right primer and setting powder, it's perfect 👌 * This is an AMAZING foundation. The coverage is perfection. It's dewy, has great ingredients, and I absolutely love it on my very sensitive skin. I have been using this since it was introduced to the Revlon line and my hope is that this will never discontinue. 🤞 I have used only high-end foundations in the past before trying this foundation and this one is a clear winner. 🙌🏻🩷😻"

It's very sheer which is nice but it really oxidizes in the skin so badly and clogs your pores. * Wanted to give this a try, one of the girls in the store recommended it for me saying its a great product. I tried it it was horrible, barely any coverage, dried very weird, and when i touched or wiped my hand over my face it was like pieces of it were coming off. I didnt even put alot on. Disappointed and would not recommend. * I have been on the hunt for a tinted moisturizer. Saw this tinted serum & based on the reviews wanted to try it out. Came in today and it was such a let down! Super watery and hss no coverage at all. I tried applying it with a beuty blender did not work, a brush was worse, ended up apllying it with my hands like i would a serum but its super patchy and hard to blend. Just a no jn my opinion, save your money snd try the purlesse tinted moisturizer with spf instead. Inwas trying to love this product in reolacement of my purlesse thats now $40, since this is more affordable but you def get what you pay for. * This product has the sheer tint I was wanting but was hard to blend. Can look patchy if it dries before blending. I try to work fast. I like how my skin feels afterwards, especially my neck. * literally so bad * This product has a lot of bad reviews but it was on sale so i decided to try it. I actually really like it! Its light but still provides some coverage. Its nice for an everyday look. * The tint is not worth the money from my opinion. I love that it is a cruelty free and available at a drugstore price. But it peels no matter the skincare used or primer. It seats on top of the skin so it hard to blend. It does look natural and I have gotten compliments on it but its bot worth the work put for it to work."

It wears well and last all day at the office. * This sucked alllllll the moisture out of my skin in a matter of hours!! I can see how it would work and look beautiful on someone with the right skin match for it, but my skin really just did not agree. My skin is still burning. * I expected this to be much lighter coverage than what it is; a heavy, thick foundation that made my skin feel like it couldn't breathe. 

The color was also much lighter than expected although it was truly neutral, which is a nice switch from most makeup that leans (and oxidizes) peach or orange. * The color match was okay, i reeeaaally wanted to love it but the inly thing is it made me break out that very same day /: i honestly loved the way it looked though! Light weight & looks pretty natural, nothing too dramatic. For my acne prone gals, i wouldnt leave this on alllll day, maybe for like some hours (less than 8 hours per say) i would buy again tbh but i just wouldn't recommend to wear it allll day like i did to the point it made me grow blind pimples (the worst) it looks very nice with setting powder! Doesnt get too oily (with setting powder) maybe my forehead looked more oily, my nose was oily but not as bad as my forehead (nothing toooo crazy) * This has a pretty finish, it looks natural and doesn't make my dry spots stand out so much. It's light weight and the color match is decent. There's no fragrance but it does have that drugstore foundation scent to it, it fades after a while though. It's quite nice. I'm 46, light skinned, freckled redhead with super sensitive dry skin. I wear the shade 209 Buff Beige (MAC NC20-ish/Wet N Wild tinted hydrator Fair/Hourglass Immaculate Shell/Haus Labs #100) * I've had mixed results with skin tints, I figure i would try this and it was on sale.  It does have a serum consistency and is somewhat runny.  I had a bit of tough time figuring out my shade., buff beige is a tad too light for my light medium skin right now. I mixed it with some bronzing drops and it helped. the finish is very beautiful and it blends so easily.  I use some primer in my oily areas and some setting powder in my tzone and it stays on and looking nice all day.  I may try to pick up another color to get a better match for my skin but with bronzer it looks nice. * I was worrying that it would be too light, but it's not"

I work in a cooler all day so trust this helps my skin! * I will say that I have used this product in the past. Its not too bad for the price of the product. However, the coverage is very light and not really buildable. Although, I do like how it gives a somewhat dewy effect. I also like how it has clean ingredients! So if you like dewy foundation, light coverage, and clean ingredients then this product might be for you. * I rarely wear foundation, largely because I hate how heavy it feels on my face, and I also love my freckles and foundations tend to cover them. I bought this out of curiosity and I'm surprisingly happy with the result! It's a pretty watery consistency, but that means A) a little goes a long way, especially when applied with a foundation brush, and B) it feels so light on my face!! It evened out my skin tone (as someone with vitiligo, this is always a big win!!) without totally covering my freckles. It looks super natural, too. I appreciate the price for the amount of product and the fact that it has no scent. 

The one con for me is that my nose felt kind of greasy a few hours later—but the rest of my face felt pretty dry, so that could just be my overactive pores LOL.

For reference, I am very pale (and I have vitiligo). I'm using shade 520- Fair. * It smelt soooo bad bro, i put it on twice, once to try and another to actually go out and then when i did it to go out it started peeling and looked SOOOOO cakey, like cakier than cakey. It smells TERRIBLE, when i was applying it i had to hurry since it smelt sooo bad, i can even explain fbe scent, but its just plain terrible, dont recommend * As I enter my mid-twenties, I've transitioned from the thick, full-coverage foundations of my adolescence to more lightweight and natural finishes. I bought this with the hopes of it being a bit more full coverage than a regular tinted moisturizer.

The color match is great, no quarrels there. It is also a great base for makeup and blends very smoothly with a beauty blender. I am, however, disappointed in the coverage. It is a very sheer foundation - it mostly just does color correction and levels out skin color. It does not do much for acne scars or dark circles. Also make sure to exfoliate and moisturize, as this will cling to dry patches. It also seems to fade a bit throughout the day.

Overall, it's a decent tinted moisturizer. Look elsewhere for lightweight with coverage. * Both my teens use this and love it. Provides a good light coverage without to much of a makeup look. * The sheerest tinted moisturizer i have. On good rosacea days i can wear this over light concealer. It feels lightweight because it is super runny."

It also looks a bit cakey but i highly recomend spraying do we setting spray onto your brush/sponge, and then blending out. * I normally wear Estee stay matte foundation but I was out and until it arrived I needed something in the meantime. I wore this out, was standing in the parking lot talking to my friends and some random lady walked up to us and said ""sorry to interupt but I just have to tell you, you are stunning"" ( she was talking to me) And then she walked off. I was never told that when I wore the Estee! What the heck, this stuff is GOLD. * I have been using this foundation for 5 years now. I will say it is not full coverage but it is buildable. This foundation feels so lightweight & it gives such a natural look. I've tried other foundations but always come back to this one cause its just so good! I tend to have an oily T-zone & everywhere else is pretty much dry but this foundation doesn't ever really cake or flake on me. I 100% recommend this foundation for an everyday natural look! * I love this foundation! it's affordable and stays on all throughout the work day * this foundation is surprisingly good for the price. it's buildable, smooth, and has a nice matte but natural finish. it flaked on my chin area after a few hours, but that could be my skin type. * Love this for my combo skin. I'm not extremely oily but I needed something that would actually last throughout the day without needing to powder by midday. I actually like it better than the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I am shade 090 in Lancome but have not been able to find a good color match as 090 is too light and the next shades are too dark and orange. I have very fair neutral skin. I prefer how the covergirl looks, it is very smooth with slightly better coverage, and L20 is a great shade and a closer match than the Lancome (maybe L20 is a dash too light but it looks perfect after bronzer). It gives a natural matte finish that doesn't cling or look cakey. Works well on my middle-age skin with fine lines. Has great medium-full coverage. Highly recommend! * I really love this foundation and I will continue to purchase it! Affordable and covers well."

I purchased this foundation and I waa impressed. I wanted to try a new product that is inexpensive and matched my complexion. Now, I find myself going in Ulta just to see if they have restocked. Even when I sweat, the makeup still looks flawless. I am so excited about this foundation and feel like my appearance has been enhanced due to formula!! Will continue to buy more! * This foundation has blown me away. I don't understand the negative reviews. It is a little runny, so shaking the bottle well beforehand is a must. But the coverage is fantastic. It dries down to a semi matte finish, doesn't accentuate texture, doesn't cling to my dry spots, nor does it make me  too oily (I have combo skin). It holds up in heat and humidity! The shade range may run a little light. I got the medium neutral thinking it would be good for when I self tan, but it actually somehow works even when I haven't tanned. Its lightly fragranced but the scent doesnt linger. Overall a great product and I keep reaching for it. Will definitely repurchase - it outperforms more expensive foundations. * My new favorite * Loved it * This foundation is a very decent price, but for what you get, it is not worth the money. It made me very patchy, and it was very hard to match a shade. It also dried decently fast, so if you didnt blend immediately, it was going to stay where you placed it. Spend a little bit more for a better product. * Its bad for acne/pores/oily skin.

Then it was impossible to blend out on my face and ruined my makeup ): * I love this powder this is the best powder that I have discovered as of lately. Elf kills it with all the products they release but this is top tier. * I really wanted to like this product, but even though I moisturize my skin, it leaves randow streaks on my face, as if i applied it with a paint brush. And leaves weird marks on my nose that I cant blend out and have to literally use my nails to scratch off. I have oily skin and never experienced this with a powder foundation. * I have fair skin and got the recommended color. It's too yellow for me and honestly isn't as good as the dermablend camo. I only got it because I can't find the dermablend camo anywhere. This doesn't stay on my skin very well and rubs off so easily. * I am 39 years old, and I have struggled to find a powder foundation that would work for my combo skin, I have spent tons of money, looked high and low, and have never been happy with anything that I found in the past. I could not believe how well, this held up for me! I am 39 years old and I had a baby nine months ago and don't have much time to do my make up but I still wanna look half decent when I have to go out of the house and this is quick and easy and effortless, I highly recommend this to anybody who cannot seem to find a powder foundation that works for them, maybe you might meet your match with this one. I do use the little sponge that comes with the powder because it works for me and I don't want to try to mess withthe system lol. * If your ever going for a simple quick look thsi is the foundation powder to use, the shade match is incredible accurate,decent coverage for a sinple quick look.

Its SO THICK in texture and sits right on top of my pores, accentuating them while it refuses to blend. Its so greasy i cant even wash it off my hands unless i use dish soap. Despite having the texture of oil paint, somehow the coverage is also fairly sheer??? How!! The only positive thing i can say is that it was cheap. * Have purchased this foundation twice already & always gets compliments on it! Super full coverage and buildable! Have yet to find my right shade but just mix it with other ones, so no complaints really. Would reccomend if you have oily skin. * I usually get the Fair to Medium Light! It doesn't take much and it lasts all day! * Wrong shade.  Salespeople were not at all helpful - Stock very low. * This Foundation is thick and applies good coverage but it stinks really bad like almost like it's made with cow manure or something. Please fix this ulta. * I did not like the color on my skin * This is by far THE most full coverage foundation you can buy.  Hands down, no joke!  It is super thick and creamy and you must work quickly to spread it on your face when applying.  It is best applied directly to the skin with your fingers, smoothed out that way, then pressed in with a puff - not a sponge and not a brush!  Moisturize very well before application too.  If you want a thinner application, thin it out with moisturizer, then apply it, but still be prepared to still be dazzled.  It will give you the most beautiful, gorgeous finish of any foundation you will ever use!"

You dont have to use a lot and literally your face is flawless. One of the things i love about this product is it doesnt dry out your skin. I got the shade neutral 25 and id say that its a mix of fair and tan. I also really love the application part of it, the wand is really nice!!! * Covers a lot without having to apply a ton. Love the application wand * I love this foundation I find myself reaching for it more  often than the others. it's not drying, not greasy,  the coverage looks like my skin but glowy, and not cakey. The kiko Milano powder is awesome too for baking BTW. This foundation is way very similar to TF Born this way foundation, (but not as greasy) kiko milano is underrated IMO. Yes I would recommend. * Good color and application, but really accentuates wrinkles. * I'm a fair to light olive undertone. I bought 2 shades, WB15 and WB25. WB25 was away too dark. I thought WB15 would match until I went in the sun it was Soo orange. disappointed. formula is good and coverage is great, just wish I can find a shade. * I like how this felt and it looked great.  Then i touched my face and prints! then this was be a matte look. I was shiny as all get out. Too much for something I would not let anyone else borrow * I wish the lightest shade was a bit lighter but is wearable.  Feels kind of heavy, you definitely feel like you're wearing foundation if not used sparingly.  Now for the good, makes a wonderful concealer, last all day and does not budge or break down.  If being used as a full face foundation, less is more with this, one drop blends out beautifully and covers up exactly what you need to cover...  Covers like a high-end concealer, last all day like a high-end foundation should last,  Definitely worth the spend..."

Blended like a dream, gorgeous satin finish, blurred imperfections, clean and fragrance free.  The color 1C was actually a cool tone, this new 1C is PEACH toned....very warm, and the formula change truly makes me sad....it's not the same. They ruined a perfect product. * I absolutely love this product! The smell is a bit strong and the application is a little off-putting, but it blends great and looks great! I found that instead of using a traditional primer like elf power grip, using a setting spray to prime made application easier and blending smoother. * My skin looked worse with this. Highlighying pores no matter how much or how many different methods i use. And shows every bump, dry patch, etc. its so weird. Like the opposite of why we wear makeup in the first place. So mad i was fooled that im writing a review * I have very fair and pink skin and have always had trouble finding foundations that match my tone, never mind work well on my oily/combination skin, but I will say that this one does a good job! I was nervous buying online without match testing, but I got the 1C and would say its a pretty good match for my skin tone. 

My pros for this are definitely: generaly matches my skin, works well with my oily/combination skin, it coming in a stick format is very convenient and mess free, stays on very well, looks natural, and doesnt make my skin feel gross

My cons would be: not the perfect match (wish the undertones were more p and that the shade was slightly lighter), can get a little cakey if i put too much on, and a little hard to blend. 

For context I've been wearing Too Faced Born this way foundation in the shade Snow for years now because it's the only foundation I've found that comes close to matching my skin, but I've always run into the same problem of not being able to apply the foundation too thick because then you can tell it's not a true match. Anyway, I would say overall thi one does a better job, has better ingredients, feels better on my skin, and is a good price point.

My last points would be dont let the 1 star reviews scare you, this foundation is very nice and as long as you use a wet sponge to apply and don't mind the mild scent of castor oil that fades in about 30 minutes :) * The old formula was amazing.  Shade 1C was a perfect cool tone as described.  This newer version is very peach in tone and no longer qualifies as cool toned.  So  if you are a fair, cool toned person...look elsewhere. * I have come back to this product again and again after trying other hydrating foundations that are too thin and messy or settle into pores. This is my favorite non-SPF foundation. It is like a natural version of cover girl compact makeup. It's vegetable oil based so it does smell like olive oil. But it's so nourishing and convenient with the solid stick. It smooths on well to a medium coverage and natural dewy finish that doesn't settle into my pores or cause breakouts for me. And with a light powder to set, it stays all day. I do wish they had lighter shades as the lightest warm (2W) is a bit dark for me in winter. But I'm a repeat customer of this good clean dry skin foundation option. * This brand is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I live in the desert and ingredients like hyaluronic acid just pull the water out of your skin because there's no water in the air here. It seemed like every make up and skincare brand hopped on that train and I couldn't find anything for my skin (dry) and climate type. I hope they never change the formula! I'm almost 30 and I'm starting to get crows ft etc and this really does a great job of camouflage without settling in any wrinkles."

I've tried the new version and it's awful I've tried fenti, tarte, double wear, and two others they all suck! * Mine always smelled like paint. Super thick, matte and cakey but superior coverage to anything made ever. * Please bring it back!!!! Nothing compares * My favorite and un replaceable foundation. I haven't found a similar to this one not one!!! This is the best foundation for OILY skin and tge coverage amazing. Loved that it last all day mind you i live in Az and the weather is HOT this foundation would not move at all. Pleas eplease being this back because Good Apple is not close at all in coverage and wear. * This was the only matte foundation i found that made my textred mature skin not look more textured and makes me look older like all other matte foundations I've tried! This one looks so amazing. Stayed all day and i sweat alot on my face. I really dont know why they got rid of this foundation. I literally have not one bad thing to say about this foundation. I really hope they bring this back!!! * Kat Von D makeup is the new skin. I love it! Beautiful colors and very good on your skin. No smearing or running everywhere.  Absolutely Amazing.

There is no good reason for testing on animals and there are plenty of good products available which ARE CRUELTY FREE too. * I purchased this on a whim as i saw it on sale. I received it at the same time another package with the new Prada foundation came in, and I'm shocked that i like the Lorac foundation more than the Prada!  I applied this with my Hourglass foundation brush as the formula is quite thin amd it went on beautifully. Its so smooth and the finish really is a soft matte. It seems to be very long lasting as well. My first favorite foundation of the year. * I finally got my hands on this foundation and I wore it and loved it right away! I will say if you're sensitive to smells it does smell like paint but it will fade. This foundations lasts all day and blurred my acne scared skin & pores. obsessed! * Lorac left no choice but to select this when they quit making the PoreFection foundation.  This has no sunscreen and it has an odor similar to molasses. I use it because it doesn't break my face out. * I love it one of the reasons I love it is because it doesn't crease and settle in my  lines and it's very very hard to find products they don't do that. I can't get over the coverage when I first tried it I was so skeptical, because it is runny and well, it just didn't seem like it was gonna be that great…! And it is in my opinion…  To apply it I use a beauty blender and it goes on amazing and for me honestly a little bit goes a long way. … I have large pores texturize skin, but yet this one seems to work good for me and not feel too heavy.… I wouldn't say it's totally water resistant, but good enough because let me tell you I've cried while having it on and it does not streak not at all at least not for me and like I said,  I'm almost 46 years old. I'm a 45 year old woman so it's been a struggle for me and I know other people have been saying a lot of different things then I am saying, but I know for me personally it is one of my favorites and always will be! And I highly recommend for more mature skin… I really really do … I have used a brush with it before and it does work good as well. Not a matte either. Just a beautiful natural finish not too dewy. Put it to you this way whenever I use the Lorac foundation, I always get compliments oh, and before I forget, it does not crease on my eyelids, and that is one of my biggest pet peeves ever 😂. * Since the perfection foundation was discontinued I thought this pro version would somehow be better. It is not. It is very heavy coverage and cakes on. It truely smells like maple syrup. Laura Mercier makes a tinted moisturizer w SPF that is more like porefection formerly by Lorac. * I HATE this foundation.  I used the lorac sheer porefection foundation foe years. when it was discontinued I was upset but thought I would give this new product a try.  I used a primer under. I used an applicator sponge. it is terrible. it is thick. I was hoping this would equate to better coverage.  no such luck. it settles into pores and fine lines. it looks chalky on the skin. it transfers easily. I HATE this foundation.  😒"

I don't think this is one of them.  It's the old school sort--the kind that feels very waxy.  If you have dry skin, you will not be pleased.  It's very hard to get the finish to look good, and even harder to get it to stay looking good.  It's probably not going to save you time or make your life easier on the go. * I am blown away by how amazing this stick foundation is!! It gives a barely there feeling which i love. It does not settle into fine lines and stays on all day. Can't wait to try more stuff from the brand!!! * This stick goes on sooo smoothly! Absolutely love the consistency of this makeup! My skin looked like a barely there makeup look, exactly what i was going for. Definitely need to extend the shade range of this makeup but other than that this stuff is amazing!! * great coverage for my skin tone and felt smooth.  please add more skin tones so all people can have it. * this shade range has every type of tone for lighter skin but for 1 dark complexion do better * I honestly dont unserstand why people who've never tried this give it a low rating due to the shade range. This is an Italian owned brand. Majority of the population is olive, light to medium skintones. Many of them/us have a hard time finding our shades. Go try Fenty Beauty if you dont like it. Anyways, this is fantastic. Super blendable and looks smooth on my texture. * the shade range is disgusting. its not like italy is a sheltered country or anything, many POC reside there. darker women, men, and all in between deserve to have products that fit their skin too. do better."

So skin ends up looking splotchy. Wipes off easily and blends with nothing. Won't purchase again! * I have combination skin, super oily with dry patches. I hate the feeling of foundation so I just prefer something super light to even out my color and mattify me. This stuff is perfect! It feels completely weightless and looks natural. It wears off gradually by the end of the day without looking crazy. Definitely my favorite face makeup! * It wiped off easily didn't  stay on my face. I would use it in a certain spot and i would try and apply it somewhere else and it would wipe off * As for color match, it's perfect. But it doesn't really cover up my imperfections like age spots * Looks great on my skin. * Very light coverage. Feels so light and soft on skin. Not oily after a full day of wear! Doesn't cover blemishes the best but will give a nice even tone over the skin. Blends nicely! * I loved this! Its very light weight. I used under this my normal skin car rountine.

This one is up there with the more high end serum foundations in every way but without the crazy price tag. It is sheer - exactly what I like! - and blends like a dream. It has staying power and flattering shades. A little goes a long way. It plays well with other products both cream and powder. No moisturizer needed as it is very hydrating - my dry mature skin drinks this up and loves it! Very happy! * I've got combination skin with an oily t-zone and dry on my forehead and underneath my eyes, this doesn't bring any of this texture out! It's light coverage which I like for daily wear and for hot days. * It's so light! Def what I was looking for. Just a psa to anyone who wants to buy this, I'd suggest buying at AT THE store because I ordered it and received it with the product spilled. Still product in the bottle, but I for some reason can't put it sideways or it leaks. So if you order it online, be aware either the bottle is just awful or it broke while it was shipping to me. 
Other than that it's a wonderful product * I have used way too many foundations from luxury to drug store and this is by far the one I always want to reach for and have a back up. I have to force myself to use other foundations. I have normal to dry skin with some hyperpigmentation and prefer light coverage foundations that looks like skin. I use a smoothing primer in my pore areas, do two pumps with a drop of oil, dab it onto my skin and blend with a brush and this always makes my skin look absolutely flawless. No caking around my nose or forehead areas. Throughout the day, it continues to melt into my skin and look better and better. I can imagine this wouldnt be ideal with those with oily skin or who want more coverage, but for me this is the gold standard and what I put all of my other foundations/skin tints against. * I think you would have to have perfect skin to like this. Absolutely no coverage. Your face just looks wet. * My makeup aesthetic goals are ""awake, and not languishing away from consumption"", and this foundation is great for that. Sheer, doesn't settle into fine lines, leaves my skin smooth and hydrated and flawless. Add a quick dab of blush and mascara and boom, people stop asking me if I've been ill."

Creamy, spreads nicely (I use a brush), nice colour matching (I consider myself a medium brown skin colour). Overall great product! * I cannot say enough GOOD THINGS about this CC cream. There comes the point when foundation is out, and CC cream is in, and I am pleased with this product's color choices, smooth texture, and luminescence. I mix two shades and apply the first color as a primer. This CC cream doubles as my concealer; it's that easy to apply. * This product: separates BADLY and doe not blend well at all; Smells weird and chemical-y; offers VERY little coverage, even for a CC cream, and is overpriced because of all these factors. Positives: it makes skin glowy and has SPF. I wouldn't buy this personally - Pacifica's skincare and fragrance are AMAZING, but makeup seems to be a weak point. * This product came out separated. Tried shaking product to get product mixed together and it came out somewhat like foundation. Does not go on skin nicely. Do not recommend. * it comes out as a clear oil with little specs of color that don't blend."

I show this to the older women in my family and you would think I was literally doing a magic trick lol shock awe and wonder. I often and loudly recommend this in True Caramel. Perfect for lace on wigs or just on skin * The foundation is very smooth and moisturizing.  It provides medium coverage, so I build it by applying several applications to get a more full coverage.  It is a great product for the price. * I have purchased this product before and I liked it. This time the product was used. It had a finger smudge print on it when l opened it and the sponge applicator had make all on one side. I ended up purchasing something else at another store. * First, note this has the ingredients that Danessa Myricks uses for her foundation at an affordable cost. This provides a great shade match, makes skin look healthy and even, easy to take with you and stays on even if you sweat. The magnesium carbonate in the formula absolutely is wonderful for sweaty moments. I just find you can't really apply it with anything other than a sponge. Brushes with dense round tops don't pick it up well, as nothing else does. If you don't want to buy a beauty sponge you'll be fine to use the one it comes with. * Great shade for Hispanic women. * Too dark/matched my hand-too dark for my face * My mom loves this foundation and looks forward to trying more products from the line"

But if your skin is pretty smooth it works great, only issue I ran into was dry skin patches but was an easy fix with a moisturizer underneath. I would definitely buy again. I usually use IT cosmetics foundation powder, but actually prefer this one for the price. * It wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't agree with my skin or skincare. It did end up looking cakey/separated after about 2 hours. * Got this on a whim since it was affordable. I needed a pressed powder to add to my collection since my favorite loose powder is from wet n wild (the banana brightening one). But this looks fine on around the face but TERRIBLE under the eyes. I dont want to return so i will use it around the face and avoid the undereyes. * Got this hoping to use as a brightening powder after setting. It looks horrible under the eye and emphasizes texture and dryness I never noticed before. I've tried using it on it's own with a powder puff or as a finishing powder with a small brush to brighten. Never had this problem with other powders. I'm 18 but I have oily, slightly textured skin and fine lines under my eyes. Even on other parts of my face I find it difficult to blend. I would return this but it works surprisingly well as eyeshadow (when paired with other eyeshadows). I'm assuming makeup returns get trashed. My favorite powders are the Maybelline Fit Me (loose and pressed). I'm trying to find vegan/cruelty free alternatives and so far the Nyx Can't Stop Won't Stop has been my closet find to the Fit Me pressed powder. This is nothing like the Fit Me pressed powder. * I purchase this as a setting powder and although I like it; it was the wrong shade. * Was so happy to try this and received it broken in the mail.

Great for looking put together on minimal makeup days. * The coverage of this bad boy is wat too light to be called a foundation, but it doesnt have any skin care benefits which is I guess why they can't call it BB cream. It's refreshing to have a product with light coverage and a natural finish instead of dewy. Great for no makeup makeup days. * I found the Tawny shade of L.A. Girl Tinted Foundation in my local Ulta's clearance section and figured I'd give it a try. When I got home, I used Ulta's shade matcher and it told me I was really Warm Sand in this product (based off entering Ginger for bareMineral's COMPLEXION RESCUE Tinted Moisturizer Mineral SPF 30). Warm Sand perfectly matches my skin right now during the winter. I'll try Tawny again in the spring/summer, but it was a close match too. I love how lightweight this product feels and how easy it is to apply — I dot it on right from the tube and the dab/blend with a lightly moist makeup sponge. It looks just slightly dewy but doesn't feel overly wet or sticky. It also works well under my bareMinerals BAREPRO 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation if I want to look more made up, but between the price and its natural look when used solo, it fits well with my minimalist approach to makeup. * I am 66 years old. It settled into my wrinkles and emphasized them.  Very sheer coverage.

It is so sheer I can't imagine it doing anything even if it was the correct color.  I contacted Well People, I thought they should know how bad the product was, and they didn't care. * W3ll people... we need to talk about the shade range. People with darker skin tones like makeup too yet the shade range completely excludes anyone beyond tan. Thankfully the darkest shade works for me so I enjoy the product but it's hard to get behind a brand that doesn't give darker skintones a thought. * I was really hoping this product would work for me but it didn't. I found the baked foundation to be much more drying than other pressed powders I've previously used. Felt like it didn't go on well and had horrible coverage. Will not be buying again. * Takes forever to build up. Not for anyone who wants medium to full coverage. Light to medium at best. * Honestly if you're looking for a foundation to take a chance on.. this is definitely it. I'm not sure why I even chose to buy this but I love it!!

So excited to have finally found a shade so spot on with my skin tone that it's almost scary. The stick foundation is easy to apply, blends well and leaves me a great natural glow. * Looked awful on me. Horrible on oily skin and def dont get if you have light skin. This foundation isnt made for light skin tones which sucks. * Perfect match almost feels like a tinted moisturizer. I'm oily so I still need a powder but for stick makeup it goes on smooth and doesn't run off. I'm sold * Okay so hear me out.. the color match to my skin is amazing!!! it blended beautifully. However, I have combo oily skin and nothing could have prepared me for how shiny and oily this foundation is. This is not a matte foundation so beware!! * Hidden Gem hands down. I have been looking for a good foundation in general for a few years now, I went high end low end drugstore I went tinted moisturizer to full coverage and non did what I actually wanted. I love make up but finding a good foundation for my oily skin that wont force me to re touch (which I'm horrible at by the way, always makes it worse) was close to impossible without making me feel like I have pounds of make up on especially for work. I had tried the Hourglass foundation stick which was highly rated and felt very chalky on my skin. I did a search of stick foundations and came across this one. I am the lightest shade in this line and am on my way to re up for a 3rd time! I have never purchased 1 item more than once since they end up not working out for a while. The coverage is amazing from one layer to a 2 layers if I want a fuller look. It glides on like butter on my skin  and gives me a glow without an oily look if that makes sense. I rarely have to completely set my face because it sets so nice on its own and will literally last me over 9 hours without any cracks or separation and looks like I just applied it minutes ago. It makes my face feel hydrated and not like I'm wearing loads of make up. This is a long review and I never leave a review but I am truly in love with this foundation! I am so thankful for this brand because I am the in between when it comes to make up, I'm a semy fare complexion with neutral undertones. Many lines have a Yellow undertone or an olive undertone which makes me look washed out. This is truly a bang for your buck and will leave your make up looking flawless."

I really love pairing it with cream contour and cream blush, and then just setting it with a setting spray- it gives a gorgeous dewy finish. You can set it with powder to make it a little more long lasting too. I always try to catch it on sale.

Three days later I broke out, having clear skin all my life. Ever since, it never stopped. I had to go on meds to cure my acne. Don't use. * I used to use the old face and body without the radiance and always loved it so im not surprised I love the new version especially because I like more of a sheen/glow to my skin. This is a very sheer coverage foundation but is buildable if you want a little more coverage. Also I can apply this over my skincare without it pilling! * I never tried the original face and body. Honestly, I was never interested in this foundation until I started watching Miss Megan Robinson on tik tok. Seriously you NEED to follow her!! I generally have oily skin. It's been a lot more calm, and a lot less oily after I got rid of all the actives, and JUST started washing, toning, and using AN OIL (I know right, but it's true, oil loves oil, using an oil will keep your skin from producing a lot of oil) I can now wear this foundation confidently, and it is BEAUTIFUL!! It's friction activated so I suggest applying with fingers and rubbing it in so you can start to feel the ""gripping and thickening"" action that happens with this foundation(which is the best most fun part for me). The coverage is obviously light but it looks like perfected skin. Only the best things are peeking through. Everything blends nicely on top, and I mean EVERYTHING, from all different brands. It wears great too and looks even better as the day goes on. Its softly radiant and skin like if you powder (which I still do) and if you don't you'll look like a freshly hot glazed donut (some people like that, some people don't) I get the hype of this foundation and dare I say it's made it into my top 5 line up!!?? Coming from an oily girl that is shocking. If you're wondering, I use the Danessa Myricks yummy skin balm in translucent as a primer, this foundation, all my other creams and liquids, and I set with Mac studio fix powder and one size setting spray. PERFECTED NATURAL RADIANT SKIN * Wear it everyday and have received unprovoked complements. * So light!  Perfect for summer and the heat. Easy to layer cheek color over…one of my big comfort with heavier products. Love this!"

It look so beautiful like natural skin! It doesn't dry matte, so definitely set it with powder. I'd say a little goes a long way! It last all day & still look beautiful even after a workout. The only areas that would slightly crease would be around my smile lines & chin but nothing crazy. I wish the foundation would be more available but it's so hard to find & the shade range isn't the best but overall 10/10 I would recommend! My closest shade is A05.5. I also tried mixing V05 & V04 to get my shade if anyone is wondering. I hope this helps.  :) * Coming from an Ulta Employee, after trying every foundation under the sun, this foundation makes my skin look FLAWLESS, airbrushed, smooth. I do have to set with a translucent loose powder because it is still a little tacky in my opinion. Shades are FANTASTIC. A02 matches me the closest; however if there was a slightly paler shade with a yellow undertone that would be my perfect match. I ordered A01 and A02 on YesStyle and to me 1 was almost darker than 2, but it may just be the undertones. ULTA PLEASE BRING THIS BACK. It took me over a week with express shipping on YS btw I paid $19 extra FYI In case anyone was going to order it, I think it ships from China. Idk what is in this foundation but  I want to buy every bottle just incase it ever gets discontinued😅😭😭😭 * My relationship with foundation is a nightmare,I'm a brown skin girl with golden undertones in the summer and pale skin in the winter,without much prep this foundation matched me perfectly and stayed on ALL NIGHT,the a night of dancing 💕LOVE THIS STUFF * Please restock ASAP! This is my favorite foundation!! I literally bought 3 bottles because I have a feeling Ulta might discontinue this foundation...
 FYI- you can still find VDL on Yesstyle BUT it's NOT the same foundation. The one on Yesstyle has SPF & it has more of a dewy finish 😩 * I hope Ulta is not going to stop selling this foundation. It is an amazing satin finish foundation. Looks flawless on the skin and makes blemished skin look smooth. Wears beautifully throughout the day and is full coverage. Highly recommend. FYI if they stop selling it at Ulta you can find it on YesStyle. * I bought this foundation in the color A06. I tend to have a hard time finding foundations because I am in the weird shade range where I'm typically between medium/tan and dark/deep in various brands. I have Neutral slightly golden/olive undertones and find that many brands get close but not perfectly my shade. Most times foundations are too golden (almost orange looking), too cool, exactly neutral when I need just a touch of yellow in the foundation, or they just skip my shade altogether. I was pleasantly surprised when this foundation was an exact match. I love the natural finish to this foundation. I have dehydrated combo skin that if not properly hydrated will get oily in the t-zone (mostly nose area) and will remain normal or slightly dry everywhere else. When I wear this for several hours my foundation goes from very natural to radiant but not oily as my t-zone starts to break into a bit of a shine. I really don't have anything bad to say about this foundation except because of the limited shade range there's a chance you may not find a good match depending on your skin tone and undertone. Hopefully Ulta continues to keep this foundation available. * I would describe this foundation on my skin as full coverage with a satin/slight dewy finish. I have acne prone skin with acne scars and this foundation covers everything without causing any texture. Long wearing and mask proof. Doesn't cause breakouts. Would recommend for various skin types."
187,187,187,187,187,187,187,187,187,187,187,187,l'orÃ©al,age perfect creamy powder foundation,pimprod2021675,2569747," * Very light, silky powder texture. The ""creamy"" title is very deceiving though. It's powder. And quite drying immediately on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this for aging skin whatsoever. Great product for on the go touch ups on oily skin. * I don't care for the sponge applicator because it really doesn't go on right, but I found that using a brush to apply is so much better and it goes on more evenly.  You can add more where needed without it looking blotchy.  I love it! Used the color Sienna * Goes smooth and cover some imperfections, but looks natural. Leaves your skin soft and beautiful. * Lightest shade, Ivory.  You MUST prep the skin with moisturizer, sunscreen and either CT Hollywood Flawless Filter or the Maybeline knockoff or a dewy primer or sunscreen.  Buff in with a brush after applying concealer where needed.  Use powder bronzer, blush and highlight and a setting spray.  It looked amazing on my 48 year old dry skin and lasted all day.  Not powdery, didn't settle in lines, let's your skin peek through (is light coverage).   I really love it. * I thought since it's called age perfect it would be a moisturizing creamy powder. Nope. It's super drying and I have combination oily skin not even dry. Feels horrible right on application You can feel the makeup. Didn't blur anything. I had to take it off within 10 mins of application. Don't buy this stuff. * I wanted to try a cream to powder foundation to try to cover some dark spots. 
This covered what I wanted. It does look a little dry after application but I'm oily so it looks more natural after a few hours. * I love the age rewind concealer and seen this after looking for a good powder foundation. it is a really creamy, finely milled powder. I don't think it's really pigmented but you get enough coverage to even everything out and in my opinion it really does blur. I use a flat top Kabuki brush to buff it in, slowly building up layers. I take product and tap it in where I need more coverage with a concealer brush. I find I get the most coverage this way. it's like your skin but better. gives you a nice natural finish and doesn't look cakey if you slowly buff and build. will be trying this as a setting powder for liquid since it blurs. it also doesn't make me breakout!"

Unfortunately, This product didn't work for my dry skin. And for the price I doesn't have great coverage. I don't see this product any different from any other pressed powder. Also, this powder has sparkles in it I guess to conceal how drying and powdery it makes the skin.. * I love this powder, my skin is dry but this powder always feels comfortable on, never adds any texture as other powders have for me in the past, def one of my fav powders * I LOVE this pressed powder! It takes away the look of shine and makes my skin look refined and even toned. I bought Ivory and it is the ideal shade for my skin tone, medium fair with pink undertones. It works well worn over concealer and foundation, or on its own. And, better still, it looks invisible and feels like nothing on skin! The mirrored compact is the perfect size for taking on the go and it even comes with an applicator sponge on a clear, hinged divider inside. Hynt thought of everything with this pressed powder! I will definitely buy again:) * I've always been reluctant to wear powder - most of the time I end up looking cake-y. This finishing powder is a game changer - so easy to apply and bonus, the packaging is so adorable! But more importantly my skin looks so velvety and super plump, definitely will be coming back for more when I'm through with this! * Love using this powder in-between zoom meetings to touch up my skin. Just gives me a more even/finished and natural look * One of my favorite products from Hynt * I used this foundation with the foam puff it came packaged with. Do not use with a brush, the powder is finely milled and will fall off your brush! I wore it over serum and moisturizer. My face got a little shiny throughout the day but that is common for me, as I have combination skin. I like that the coverage is buildable, I was able to apply two layers and achieved the coverage I was looking for. Best of all, the ingredients are natural and truly clean! No SLS, no parabens, no Lauryl Lysine, no Bismuth oxychloride! So happy Ulta is carrying this brand!"

I recommend performing a gentle face exfolation before bed time and removing any peach fuzz for any makeup aplication, not just this foundation. It makes a huge difference in aplication and appearance of the final look/finish.
It works best with the Vanish smoothing primer. (To smooth down the pores that every human being has) It is runny but extreamly pigmented. Do not use too much or it will look cakey.Best apply with a dense buffer brush (Morphe 444 is my favorite) and then press it in with a beauty blender. I use the professional Kryolan setting spray first, and then set it with a good powder.( Jeffree Star, Fenty or Kryolan powder) It holds for 14h even in humid Florida. Best foundation for events. It's best for normal/ combination skin. I wish they had more shades.
Unfortunately it just has been discontinued, tho the company has gave me insites that they are working on perfecting the formula and making a new foundation for combination/oily skin (they currently carry luminous foundations for normal/dry skin) * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * This product is so thin & runny! Like water consistency. I pumped one pump on my hand & it literally dripped off me. I shook the bottle so many times & it still remained runny. I gave it a try on my face because I wanted to give the foundation a chance but the product just settled right into any crevice it could. I could literally see wrinkles/lines I didn't even know I had. * I got this during a sale and was so excited to try my first Hourglass product. I followed the instructions and reviews and only used a very little amount. It brings out my pores horribly, dries down very weird and makes my skin dry, and even though it feels light on my skin my skin feels a tiny bit sticky, not something I usually experience with prestige brand foundations. This is a miss for me. * This foundation is very reminiscent of Marc Jacob's 'Remarcable' . Full coverage and matte with a pore filling matte primer underneath . The bad reviews are really just people who don't know how to apply makeup . * Words do not explain how buttery this foundation is I have dry to normal skin and it blends it two to three glides. Will never use another foundation"

I have combo oily skin and so far regardless of the primer or moisturizer this just doesn't look good and will break down. I've been using juvias place which I like ten times better and I don't have to try to make it work. This foundation also oxidizes orange..so not just a shade but it'll turn more orange as well. I'm gonna try to find something to mjx it with but I won't be purchasing again and wouldn't recommend it. * I have oily combo skin, and this foundation did not stand the test of time. It felt very heavy, and transferred with the slightest touch (with setting powder). Only a few hours in, and it was breaking apart on my face, highlighting even the slightest texture. My pores were literally drinking this product up. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a foundation, and could not wait to take it off. * I have combo skin, I use the Bobby brown moisturizer primer underneath and only use a tiny bit with a brush. Looks flawless!! Do not use to much product otherwise it will look cakey, if you need extra coverage apply only to specific area with smaller brush. * 32f (no active breakout/indented scars only on cheeks/combination skin)This foundation has the worst formula I have ever used on my skin. I tried two different primers underneath and tried it on it's own and it just refused to settle or smooth out. It creases badly and makes skin look dry and caked with very minimal use of the product that looked worse and worse if you tried to use even a tiny bit more. Powders and setting spray do nothing to help. I tried beauty blenders and brushes and neither made it better. I ended up going back to a trusty Revlon foundation that was way cheaper and a much better formula. Do not waste your money if you do not have perfect smooth skin. * I have sensitive skin with large amounts of rosacea and occasional eczema. This product covers my redness very well, and can many my dry areas seemingly disappear. Smashbox was also a line that came up multiple times during my search for products best for sensitive skin. * Maybe this just doesn't work with some skin types. I've given this several goes with different amounts of product and application techniques and it always manages to cake up and accentuate every pore after it's settled. I decided to give this one more go, applying after a glowy moisturizer that managed to save some of my other cakey products and it still had the same issues after setting for about 20 minutes. * It has perfect coverage,  a very little goes a long way.  Love the Matt finish I got.  Like  all foundations,  you have to prepare your skin before you applying anything to it.  Use a brush to apply.  I patted it on."
