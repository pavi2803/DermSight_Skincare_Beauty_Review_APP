It seperates after a few hours on me and it also smudges wuite a bit even with a powder on. * This foundation is not like the previous ones it replaced. It is cakey. Bring back the old ones. * As soon as I applied it on my face, my face turned red and started itching, rashes * I have an olive undertone that has historically made shade matching a nightmare, and my skin is also really oily so foundation almost always ends up breaking apart or slipping off. The UD Face Bond is one of very few that holds up against my oiliness and the ONLY one that both holds up AND matches my skin undertone that I've tried. I have worn this multiple times for 12+ hour days at work, and once for 17 hours as a bridesmaid running around at a wedding in the rain. I did blot my face for the wedding at around the 14 hour mark but I honestly could've gotten away without it. 

This foundation probably would not work on those without oily skin - I can imagine that it would feel really drying if you're not endowed with an oil slick face like I am, especially since it has alcohol pretty prominently in the ingredients. But for the very oily, this is definitely worth a try. * I've been an Urban Decay foundation believer for over 10 years. Although it can be frustrating when a formula is discontinued (I started with the original Naked foundation, which changed to Stay Naked, which is now seemingly being phased out.) I will say that Urban Decay delivers in helping customers find a suitable shade match with their new formulas. 
This formula is lightweight, not heavy or greasy, and blends seamlessly. I continue to be an Urban Decay believer. I have tried other brands and they simply don't compare to the quality * This product  is my first time l buy that brand they  were out of the product  l buy . * I love this. It is waterproof the only thing is it startsn ""cracking"" by end of day. I don't set it with anything which could be the problem I also have dry skin and it does settle there. The coverage is perfect and I just use more moustierizer in the morning. 💖"

The cons, which is why I am going to stop using it, is that Alcohol Denatured (pure alcohol form) is the third ingredient. It has sensitized my skin. It causes noticeable redness and irritation. It is so disappointing.    I cannot use this and do not recommend it. 

I hope they reformulate again and remove this harsh ingredient. * I love this foundation!  It has great coverage and the sunscreen is a major plus! * Long lasting. Premium quality. It's a little matte/flat, so I add a little of my it Cosmetics foundation to give it a little glow and dimension. J'adore! * Long lasting, great coverage, good undertone, could not ask more from a foundation! * I wanted to love this, but I'm having a hard time. It seems to get cakey with a full day wear. I've tried it with different primers, no primer, different setting mists and no mists--same effect. I like the coverage it gives, and the color match is pretty good, I'm just not in love with the all day wear on this one. * Really appreciate that Lancôme offers shades for olives undertones. I finally found my perfect match. The foundation is full coverage but doesn't feel heavy on the skin. It lasts all day. I don't even have to powder through out the day. * This is my go-to foundation. It never disappoints!"

The color matches my light olive complexion (Figi), it goes on smoothly (I use a brush), my skin looks flawless.  After a few minutes I don't even feel like I have foundation on, my skin feels velvety.  This foundation is long lasting with great buildable coverage. * I am 53 and have been looking for a foundation that helps take a fee years off my face..I found it finally!! Blends beautifully with my brush, doesn't settle into fine lines and reduces pores. The color match is perfect! I have never bought a Nars product till now, but I am now a repeat customer! * Ive been using Nars for years. I have tried other foundations but i always end up coming back to Nars. I always get complements on my skin when i use this foundation. It sets very naturally. * I'm not gonna lie, this foundation is really, really bad. I'm using the shade Oslo which is a perfect match but this foundation somehow just smears all over my face while highlighting my pores/texture and breaks down after an hour or two. It just does not want to sit properly no matter what I do. I've tried using a brush, beauty blender, my hands, puffs and it doesn't make a difference. Even with prepping my skin (dry skin with sometimes oily tzone) - I've done my full skincare routine, minimal routine and no routine and this foundation somehow behaves the same. Setting spray and a translucent powder also do not help. It's just not good no matter what I do, which is extremely disappointing. * I tried this foundation because Loreal Infallable did not last long on my oily skin, and Tarte Amazonian Clay was cakey and made my pores and lines very visible. I applied Smashbox Mattying Primer on my face, then blended the NARS foundation with a sponge. I finished with Maybelline finishing powder. My makeup lasted all night and I looked younger because of the great coverage. I highly recommend this foundation if you have combo or oily skin, but definitely use a good matte primer! * My new favorite foundation! It matches my skin perfectly and blends so well with high coverage as well. It feels great on my skin!"

It feels so silky going on. It blends really easy. * Does anyone have dupe recommendations for the original formula in other brands? I'll be switching after trying this reformulation. It's really awful, listen to all the bad reviews! 

The new formula is no comparison to the original. Very greasy, even on dry skin. Separated within an hour of wear, accentuated poors & fine lines, and left dry patches looking flakey. Does NOT provide full coverage, even after a few passes of attempting to build the coverage (in vain). Transfers very easily, even after setting with powder. This formula never set on my skin and just felt gross. * Ive been using Mac for years. And this new stuff is horrile. My face looks cakey doesnt stay on, just rubs off. The old stuff used ti be sweat proof. But not anymore. * I gave this 5 stars several months ago when I first bought it, because the first time I used it it really did seem to look nice and last. I don't know what changed but I don't like wearing it anymore, it definitely oxidizes & my face looks greasy after just a couple hours. I keep having to powder it. It also separates a lot, especially on my forehead and it's kind of drying. I'm now searching for a new foundation. Double Wear lasts better but dries me out and ends up looking chalky. * NONE, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, USING IT FOR YEARS. * Sinc they changed the formula it's terrible unfortunately. I have been using this since I was 15 and it has never failed me, until I bought this 3 weeks ago in the new pump bottle, also the new formula. Slightly devastated, it sits nothing like it did before on the skin, it does not matter whether you use the most expensive quality primer, setting powder, spray, all of it can't fix the awful quality of the new formula, and trust me, I tried it all in the 3 weeks hoping maybe...but it's just awful. So bad I literally called Mac and left them a phone review because please give us back what we loved. Until then they've lost a literal lifetime customer, I'm sorry comrades, tight the good fight, try it yourself side by side your old formula if you have some still, then spam Mac with your reviews until they change it back, please, can't we just have this one thing in this timeline?"

That's why I decided to give this item a try. I usually use their loose powder as a matte coverage when I want to look more natural and I also frequently use their bb cream with SPF. But I wanted to get a product to help with full coverage on top of my cream foundation, and THIS IS IT! This barepro powder almost erases the different imperfects you don't want to show up when sporting a full coverage look, while looking like your actual skin! And the matte aspect is great for someone like me who is naturally oily skin. I highly recommend * I've always worn Bare Minerals brush on loose powder. This one was on sale at Ulta so I decided to try it. I love the ease that it goes on snd the coverage it gives. My new favorite foundation. * So far, I am really liking the powder foundation. I had used the bare pro liquid for years, but they recently changed the formula and it looks really bad on late-30s dry skin. 

The reason for taking off one star is because I feel like the make up only lasts until lunch, even with a primer and expensive finishing spray. However, it comes off ""evenly"" if that makes sense. No patchiness or weird peeling. * I've been using this foundation for many years, and I love the coverage, and it's clean ingredients.  It never makes my skin look dry either. * BEST FOUNDATION POWDER EVER. * For me, Barepro 16HR is perfect. I suffer Rosacea and I can give myself the coverage I want, although less is    better than more."

I do use a setting powder so everything stays put all day * I have dry skin quite often because acne medication. This is the best I've found that doesn't flake and stick to my dry patches. I use a wet sponge to apply it. * As of summer 2024, I've been using this foundation for over two years on my ""mature"" 47 yo skin. It looks great and preforms well with any skincare I've ever worn underneath, including different sunscreens. (PSA - this has SPF but shouldn't be relied upon as your only SPF in a day.) Looks great. The color range seems completely constant across the brand. So if you started with the Doublewear Stay in Place and were looking for something lighter and more natural finish, you can choose your ""usual"" shade. * I have worn the double wear sheer foundation in dessert beige for years. They changed it so much; it is hardly the same foundation now. The double wear in full coverage is too much for aging skin (I find). I looked at the serum tint and it was clearly too oily for me and too sheer. The hydra rescue, on the other hand, is the new deal. A lot of sun protection, just enough coverage. And most importantly I finally matched the color the right way and that is to my neck. Turns out I was never desert beige, I am exactly Ecru. Who knew! It can look flaky if you don't have a moisturized enough base. Also, start with a smaller amount, then build up coverage as needed to avoid caking. Other than that, it stays on and does not easily transfer. * I love the formula. It's highly pigmented so a thin layer is plenty, you don't feel like you're wearing anything. The only problem is the tube it's in is the worst foundation container I've ever had. I dismissed other reviews of people complaining bc I thought maybe it was user error, I was wrong. The pump leaks everywhere leaving a huge mess every time you use it. * This product is very runny, which I read in the reviews.  It doesn't take a lot of product to cover, and I really like the color (Fresco) and how it disappears after application.  My face feels hydrated most of the day after use.  I did detect a slight odor, but it was very faint, and it goes away quickly.  You just have to be careful, removing it from the tube.  Plan on it being a little messy.  I do like it so far, and it gives me a natural look. * Great product"

I am almost out of product, but i can tell there is soooo much more leftover on the sides of the bottle. The problem is that it's impossible to scrape it due to the doe foot applicator fitting through such a narrow hole. * I actually had an ulta employee try this on me in the store and my daughter was stunned at how good it looked. I have malasma and it really evened me out , my daughter said she never has seen my skin look that good. I hate heavy makeup and I really only use this for under my eyes and over my cheeks where my malasma is. , more as a concealer. It works very well. I may try their spf tint too. I recommend this. * This is my everyday go to foundation! Gives me great coverage and I love that it has skincare built in it. The ingredients are clean and I've noticed my skin feels and looks so much better since I started using this. I'm on my second bottle and swear by this stuff. * Absolutely flawless. I can wear it sheer or full coverage! Not sticky, not cakey!!! I also love the primer it makes my skin super smooth and prolongs the make up even more ! Filter in a bottle ! (Use the pur brush as well) * holy grail foundation, i will never but another again 😍😍😍😍 * I've tried many foundations and have had incredible difficulty finding one that matched my skin tone (pale neutral) and didn't oxidize.  This foundation is perfection (shade LN2).  The color stays true and doesn't oxidize throughout the day as so many foundations have done on my skin.

It has a natural finish, sits very smoothly on and blends easily into my combination skin without emphasizing dry patches, lines, or pores.  My skin is fairly reactive, and I've had no negative reactions to this foundation.  The coverage is buildable and so good that I no longer have to wear concealer.  I've found that using a setting powder does help it wear throughout the day, but it's still nice even without.  I hope PUR continues to make this foundation forever! * also love it because shade TN3 is a perfect color match for my skin tone."

It has great coverage for a skin tint, and looks so nice on the skin. However, shortly after using it I started getting deep cystic acne along my cheeks and jawline. I didn't think it was this at first, I actually thought it was my retinol. I pulled back on everything for a few weeks to let my skin clear. After about three weeks, I used this once again while on vacation. I woke up the next day with 2 new painful cysts and pimples around my chin. It's important to note that I double cleanse every night, and on days that I wear makeup I TRIPLE cleanse. It makes me sad to have to toss this out, but the acne and scarring this has caused is definitely not worth it. :( * This is my favorite skin tint EVER! Its good for every day use and has pretty hood coverage. my only issue is the packaging, its in a serum like dropper bottle. i find it to be really annoying, and it does leak really bad if you dont put the lid on REALLY tight. Ive also had the dropper part break of in the bottle! * I want to love this makeup so much, but it is definitely the cause of my breakouts. I gave it one last try when my skin was clear, and sure enough, at night when I washed my face, it was covered in red bumps. Like the annoying, everywhere, red, pesky pimples. The skin tint is soo pretty on though, so I'm sad to have to stop using it. If you aren't acne prone, give it a try. If you are acne prone, it's (unfortunately) probably not worth it! * I love this skin tint!!! I have dry skin and this applies flawlessly! Ive always applied foundation products with my fingers and do with this one as well. It has moderate to full coverage even with a thin serumy texture and a beautiful pearlescent. It lasts all day and looks the same on application as the end of the day. Highly recommend! also, shade matches perfectly for me. * I really like this foundation. I hate the dropper and I wish they were sealed. They get opened at the store and are a mess when you want to buy them. I ordered this online so it was nice and clean. The coverage is good and it does last all day. I ordered a pump and it is much better. It gives a nice glow but does not look greasy. * I loved this skin tint at first, i thought it looked beautiful on my skin. but i woke up the next morning with pimples all over my face. for reference i have oily, slightly acne prone skin and im a teenager, so if that also sounds like you i would not reccomend!!! * This product surpassed my expectations! For being someone who likes a more natural look, this is perfect! Coverage is buildable and it makes my skin look glowy all day. The formula makes it so easy to blend."

The smell was absolutely terrible, I found the coverage to be uneven, and after an hour or so of wear, I looked in the mirror and it really exaggerated my fine lines and pores. I for sure would not recommend this foundation to anybody over the age of 35. * This is a no for me. It smells terrible and does not work on my skin. Exaggerates dry spots, separates in oily areas, and looks cakey with any amount of product. I've tried applying with fingers, brushes, and sponges. I'm really disappointed I spent so much on it. Drugstore foundations are much better quality than this one! * This is a difficult foundation to work with, the coverage never looks even to me and it's not buildable. up close, I can see it pills on my skin if I pass the sponge over it more than a couple of times. cream products don't layer over it well - it's hard to blend cream blush, bronzer and highlighter on top and it transfers and moves all over the face. It doesn't really set down, even with powder. I have dry skin and never have issues with uneven coverage or getting a foundation to set down, with or without setting powder. I'm just not a fan, I have wet n wild, Catrice, urban decay and Pat McGrath foundations that all perform better across the cost spectrum. * This a wonderful foundation. It gives perfect coverage, making my skin look dewy and fresh.   The best part is that it is a clean product, without the bad stuff.I love this brand. * Not enough coverage for my aging skin! * Unsure. It's not like it's a bad product. I feel it's good quality. I think maybe for a lighter foundation could be a good find. I feel for the price, what my expectations were; not a good buy necessarily. Fell a bit flat for me. I've also only used a couple (2-3) times. Maybe it grows. My skin feels nice.
I don't feel excited afterwords-if that makes sense? Sometimes I put on foundation and I'm like ""OO-Hello there!"" I put this on and feel like…ehh. Best way I can put it. I did have a more positive prospective when adding a glow enhancer. It's ok."

I have tried a number of known products and hands down IT has it all! * This is now my favorite foundation. Very light with super coverage and very natural looking. Will continue to buy this again. * Im not too familiar with powder foundation so i decided to try this one and it went on smoothly, not cakey, blends wells. * I loved this product so much and went to buy another one and now they have removed the sunblock which was a huge plus. Now I have to find something else… Any recommendations? I love this formula and the results. Previously! * I am in love with this powder!! I am in my 50's and it covers all of my imperfections. Looks so natural that I  have people tell me how beautiful my skin is. My favorite thing about this product is that I can build it to my liking without it looking caked. * It was the perfect last step for my make up. Really helped to cover up some of the redness in my chin and nose. * So happy the sunscreen was removed. The increase in skin cancer since the sunblock/fear the sun campaign started, has skyrocketed. And our d has plummeted. Oral D, no good. Sun is above us for a reason, a VITAL reason."

Then I noticed it was smearing, bronzer and blush disappeared. Definitely not transfer resistant and lasts maybe 4 hours before it falls apart. Not worth the price performs way worse than $8 drug store foundation * It doesn't help that the person at Ulta was convinced that my skin is more pink than it actually is... So the color is wrong, but the formula is bad. Every fine line is made more visible and it looks rough. * this is advertised as a serum foundation, but it's really not. it does not however feel heavy on the face, but if you're looking for light coverage this is not for you! recommend for oily skin, it is matte and dries down kinda quick so move fast! oxidizes kinda bad so be mindful of that with shade selection! overall beautiful foundation, looks very pretty and lasts a long time! as a makeup collector its for sure a 10/10 * Trust me when I say I have tried this product so many times, I mean it. I saw so many good reviews and decided to buy it. The first time the color oxide so bad, it left me red and orange by 3 shades darker, not impressed I decided to color exchange. Even then it's too dark, so I go 2 shades darker, and I finally have somewhat of a good color match. But despite the color match, the wear is terrible. I tried primer, no primer, moisturizer, no moisturizer, almost every single possible match, and it does not work. It left my skin so textured and patchy, it shocked me. I'm very much an Estee Lauder girl because she leaves me silky yet matte. But unfortunately this foundation did not cut it, and I really wanted to like it. * Loved the coverage and how long it lasted. However I was orange by the end of the day. It oxidized rather quickly. It's unfortunate because it really lasted all day in a kitchen without making me shiny. * even with a good skin care routine, i still have those days where i break out from time to time. This foundation blurs out my breakouts PERFECTLY, giving me smooth skin as long as i set with powder. Literally my holy grail."

Do not recommend * I absolutely lovee this foundation but unfortunately for me personally i had to stop using it because by the end of the day when i would take my makeup off id be breaking out but other then that this foundation is not only affordable it's beautiful skin matched , smooth almost air brush base , full coverage, and easily blendable with both other cream or powdered products! * I have been using L'Oreal Paris for a long time and it seems like the more I use it, the cakier it gets. * The strong perfume smell and clogged pores after wearing has deinfluenced me from repurchasing. Great color selection, matte finish, and good for mixing with sunscreen or a luminizer. I will try others from this brand bc of color range and affordability. * I'm glad I'm not the only one who has noticed a formula change now that it's 32 hour wear and not 24. Not only are the shades not the same, it wears horribly 😩 go back to the old formula!!!! * I have tested it twice, I apply it in the morning and in the afternoon my skin is very oily. The foundation stays in place, foednt separate, but my face looks like a grease ball, even with powder, so judt not for ne. * Very mate finish I love it especially for oily skin!"

Newsflash: it cant. The old formula would last all day. It was my go-to if i was going to the waterpark or knew i would be sweating. This new stuff is almost worse than their ""original"" liquid foundation. The old formula would not settle into any lines. It made me look 10 years younger. This stuff is greasy, creases into every line on my face, does not last even a few hours. I went out grocery shopping and running some errands and the makeup had blotched, settled into lines, made me look old, it was so bad and i'm so disappointed. Please bring back the old formula!! * Bare Minerals was apparently sold to another company and since then they've changed the formula as well as shade range.  They've discontinued my shade ""Natural 11"", this shade was true to my skin color.  I will no longer be using this foundation, it was my favorite foundation ever. It's too bad.  I was lucky enough to find my shade and the old formula at another store. * the shade I received was just a touch too light, however the way it sat on my face, I just didn't care for it, it really felt like you could literally see layers of makeup, returned and thought about trying in a different shade but they didn't have it in stock, so just a sign to try something else * Only foundation that doesn't turn my skin a greenish color! I tried so many with the salesperson in my local store. This is the only product that works! * This new gormula is awful and does not last all day on oily skin. Settles into fine lines and breaksdown after a few hours even with a primer and setting powder * I cant believe the bad reviews on this formula.   I also used the old formula and it was good but never a true shade match.    I absolutely LOVE this formula.   great coverage but looks natural and is buildable.  It lasts all day.

The pump for it is just terrible. Gets stuck after every pump. * This foundation looks great for maybe 3 minds after application.  I've tried everything to get it to stay. It settles into fine lines making them appear bigger, loss cakey, seperates, and feels disgusting.  0 stars if I could. * I love this foundaton !!! I was hesitant at first since i rarely wore make up and got it to wear for my sisters wedding but i got loads of compliments and the shade matched my skin perfectly and i didnt look like a cheeto ! * I loved the color and feel and was excited about the skin benefits.

I am so lucky I found this since I was using another even pricier foundation. If you have drier skin, or skin that is combination, and if you have rosacea like I do, this is excellent.

I got  y5-y7 and its a perfect color for me. It goes on so smoothly and you can do a light touch or full coverage and its not drying. * I was drawn to this because the other 3 high end French designer foundations have perfume. At 65, I still have oily skin.  An Ulta associate recommended this. It is like velvet. Beautiful. I used a high quality foundation brush to apply. * Not that this product needs another glowing review, but it is a stand-out addition to my makeup collection.  I apply it with a brush, and it is like swiping an airbrush filter over my face and feels like nothing is on!  I would say the finish is 'soft matte' - it takes down shine and doesn't look dry, cakey, or flat.  Very easy to work with and pretty amazing results.  I travelled with it recently, and it very travel-friendly - doesn't seems fragile and is just so darn easy, fast, and fuss-free to apply (no extra setting powder needed).  Because it is lighter coverage (light-to-medium coverage) than other options, I have slotted this as a go-to everyday or light-makeup-day foundation.  The color match for me is spot-on as well - I got 'R4' which blends to my skin color/tone as well as my favorite reference shade, which is Estee Lauder Double Wear in 2C3 Fresco. * I usually wear liquid products but decided to get a powder for the summer and thought it try this. I used the find my shade feature and it ended up being the perfect match!! It looks amazing on and very natural. I also have very sensitive skin and I have no reaction after applying. Highly recommend to try!! * This is, by far, one of the best powder foundations I have ever purchased. There are so many shades to choose from, and the associate who took the time to help me find the best match, was excellent. The coverage is buildable, and it wears very well and does not settle into fine lines. Highly recommended! * Great for aging skin, doesn't settle, crease. Goes on smooth, light coverage (buildable). I love it, all DM is amazing, everything I've tried❣️👱🏻‍♀️ * I've always been a little hesitant with powder foundations. For reference I have combo skin (oily t-zone, dry elsewhere), and this looks beautiful on both skin concern areas! It doesn't catch onto dry patches and melts well into my oily areas. A slight complaint is the amount of kick-back the powder produces in the compact, so it can be a little messy, but it's really not a big deal."

HOWEVER, the packaging is not my favorite and could use improvement. * Great natural looking foundation but it NEEDS lighter shades. The lightest shade gets darker over time with use and it isnt light enough to begin with. I have to mix it with a ligint concealer for it to work. Also the packaging is a bit awkward and does speed up the oxydation * Very good tinted foundation. * I've ditched the high end brands. This is my nee go to. This doesnt cake or get patchy.

Everyone i recommend this foundation to is hooked!!! 
Not sure why people don't like it but if youre looking for a foundation that will last and get your moneys worth, this js it! * Updating my review! I spoke too soon. This foundation is horrible and is the first makeup that I have ever returned. It transfers so easily, I would find it smeared on my phone. Using without the CT Hollywood filter, the is texture is awful and it only lasts a few hours.  Save your money and go with another foundation. * Really high quality, longwearing foundation. Makes my 60-sometjing skin look lawless all day. Must prep skin thoughly with moisturizer beforehand but really top notch. * I love it! I've tried so many other products. But this is actually full coverage. It matches my skin and lasts all day. It's pricey but worth it. * Just to clarify, I did not get this product for free so my review is not biased. I've tried Laura Geller, Clinique, KVD, Il Makiage, etc., and I believe my search is over now that I have found Charlotte Tilbury's Airbrush Flawless. For those having problems with it looking cakey, the most important thing to remember is skin prep ... make sure you use a good cleanser, toner, serum and moisturizer prior to your foundation always. It took me awhile to really accept how important skin prep is but it is so true! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this foundation! It truly does look flawless. My very unobservant husband even commented on my makeup the first time I used this foundation ... he said my skin had a beautiful and healthy glow.
Thank you Charlotte Tilbury! * Has beautiful coverage especially for those that have acne scarring and redness like myself! I didnt get oily all day and wasnt transfering off. * A little definitely goes a long way with this product coverage-wise but it left my makeup with an odd texture and a matte finish (in a bad way) that tended to look cakey even with just a small amount of foundation. The color 3C also didn't match the 3C from my tube of Charlotte's Beautiful Skin Foundation. Not the worst foundation I've ever tried but not worth keeping. Returned."

It's so easy to blend, leaves a beautiful skin like finish and lasts all day. I haven't gone back to any other foundations, this is my tried and true * There were things I liked about this foundation-the skincare benefits, the light feel and look after initial application BUT, it was watery so it sunk into my pores and emphasized the texture of my skin horribly. It also had zero staying power. It was usually breaking up or worn off within three or four hours but still managed to remain lodged in my pores further emphasizing them. If you aren't worried about pores and skin texture you might want to try this but it did not work for my more mature skin. * This is by far my favorite foundation.

Ive used setting powder and the OneSize setting spray and still got tranfer which is a huge deal breaker for me. * I've used this product for years. This purchase from Ulta was the worst it cosmetic I ever purchased.  Even the color was off. Very disappointing * It's all I were * This foundation is really amazing, soft ,light and full and coverage.  Easy to use and stay the whole day. * Been using this foundation for years. I'm 30, and enjoy that it has sunscreen and anti-aging effects! It is a bit pricey, but honestly a little goes a long way, and one bottle lasts me forever. I also enjoy the dewy sheen it gives to my skin. I get many compliments that my skin looks great when wearing this. The only issue is that it can accentuate your dry patches, and it happens only on my nose since it tends to get dry. So I just make sure to exfoliate and moisturize a little more. * Perfect for paler, mature women, covers flaws"

Some pilling.  I was hoping to love it, but will be returning it. * This product gives my skin a dry, cakey, look. Its probably the SPF aspect of it. * I wanted so badly to love this one, since the size of the product for the price compared to others was so good! And i know as a tinted moisturizer there wont be much coverage but this is zero. And its so streaky, wont blend or build, makes me look greasy. The setting powder from this brand was life changing and i wont use another, but this moisturizer gotta go unfortunately * Let's be clear, this is a tinted sunscreen. It felt thick and cakey on my skin yet there was no coverage. Also made my skin looks super greasy. * I tried Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and foundation for about 6 months (way too long). This makeup completely wrecked my skin. I've never had a major issue with acne or clogged pores until I used this crap.  (I moved shortly before switching products and thought it was a mix of a dryer climate and hard water that was making my skin look awful). It's been 9 days since I stopped using this brand/products and it's crazy how much better my skin looks and feels. * For starters, this product is perfect for those ""no makeup"" look days! I wore this, went to a water park for 5 hours, and my face didnt get sunburned! * Love this moisturizer. Feels light and gives the perfect amount of color and a smooth look."

I have been trying to use of my older foundations but I keep on reaching for this bottle and I can't stop using it. I have combination skin so I break out on my cheeks usually and around my jaw line. On my nose and chin, my skin appears more dry. This has been one of the only foundations that does not overly show my fine lines or dry out my face. My skin looks glowy and healthy all day. It stays on my skin and applied best with a damp sponge. This foundation has truly changed my life. * Mac Studio radiance is a light foundation that has very good coverage, super recommended. the skin is left like silk. I love it * Based of other foundations I use, the recommended color was NC20, which ended up being too warm. I went into the store and the associate matched me to C4 which looks so beautiful on my skin! This is a buildable foundation that needs a damp beauty blender to smooth out the finish.  I highly recommend this—it gives me Luminous Silk vibes. * After second use, it made my face look flakes.  I put it on like I was shown in the store. * Very good material. * I thought this foundation would be thinner because it's a ""serum"" powered foundation. It is too thick for my taste. If you want a minimal coverage foundation, this is not it.  Otherwise, it is a good product. * I just started to use it and I love it. Really hydrating."

Doesn't gather in my dry skin or wrinkles smooths out my face. * I like the product (B40) but half gets wasted bc the packaging is designed poorly.  The top doesnt come off so s we hen pump cant reach the priductvtherecis no way to access it. Very wasteful. * Ever since Mac reformulated their studio fix fluid, I'd been on a deep search for something that even came close. I had tried so many different brands to no avail, and was about at the point of giving up when I decided to give the Chanel Ultra Le Teint a try. Thank GOD I DID! This makeup is absolutely amazing and I like it even better than the old studio fix fluid! It glides on super smooth. Contains ingredients that make my skin moisturized and subtle. It does not oxidize at all and looks even better as the day goes on! The color you see is the color you get. Doesn't separate or get cakey. Doesn't settle into fine lines. Doesn't break me out. Doesn't make me oily and doesn't slide off. I feel absolutely gorgeous in this and my husband just can't take his eyes off of me wearing this. Yay! I'm so happy and I hope Chanel keeps making this one. * I've tried many foundations on the market (ELDW, Dior, Mac, etc) and this one is definitely the best for combo skin! You don't need much, yet it covers fairly well with a damp beauty blender. Feels like you're wearing nothing at all, and looks like skin vs looking like you're wearing a mask. Went for a power walk in 80 degree weather (after using setting powder on top) and there was no sweat or oil that broke through at all! The smell is quite strong but smells like perfume. I have sensitive skin yet my skin did not react to this scented foundation. It is well worth the money!! * This makeup wears so well even when outside all day. I love that it doesn't transfer when I blot my face. * This is a great foundation that offers medium coverage, long wear and a soft matte finish. I have been using it since Perfection Lumiere was discontinued in the USA around 2019. Le Teint is similar but less heavy.  I went hiking in summer and it stayed on. It does not dry out my skin. For reference, I have light olive skin and use ELDW 3N1. Chanel's shade range spans from light to dark in 3 undertones: Beige Rose (BR), Beige Doré (BD), and Beige (B).  I tried all three undertones in the light-to-medium range and settled on B30, a neutral. I set it with Chanel's loose powder #3. It doesn't burn, sting, itch, or cause break outs. I've tried other brands that irritated me after a couple of weeks. When I return to this, my skin heals and remains clear. * I ordered the B20 shade, described as a neutral undertone. as soon as I put it on, it was orange, and not for pale skin. I had to return it and was unable to exchange it for the right color because Ulta doesn't carry Chanel in store"

Do not buy! * I was expecting a little more coverage but does feel like skin. It looks beautiful but on acne days not even with a few layers it doesn't add to much coverage. * I'm so impressed by this foundation and have told all my friends about it. My skin looks incredible with it on and it applies so nicely, very light but great coverage! I dont even wear concealer with it! I put on a light moisturizer (I use Caudalie vinoperfect) and then apply the foundation with a brush. 5 stars!!! * This may be the worst foundation I've ever tried; I could not get this to apply correctly-i tried a brush, sponge and my fingers-there was just no applying this stuff. It was somewhat watery but I could not get it to spread on my face-i don't think I've ever had that happen with a foundation.  I wish I could give it 0 stars. * Looks very nice on * The best!"

Works great and I love that there is a brush attached for smoothing since I tend to use this like concealer * I bought this shade cuz the ulta girl told me it's my shade but when I got home and tried it it's too light for me.😭 * I'm 42 and love trying foundations. This is hands down my favorite foundation for longwear or when I want a more full makeup look (wouldn't wear this to the gym or errands). I always get compliments, tip- don't use primers or too much product beforehand. This finish is sp amazing. I buy a darker shade to counter...so easy. * I absolutely love this foundation stick. It goes on smoothly and stays all day long. It is medium coverage, but looks very lightweight and natural. I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and i have had no issues with this at all (which is a first!). It is probably $5-$10 over-priced and is also a pretty small quantity, but it is worth it as long as you aren't using it constantly. If you were, you would run out quite quickly and it just wouldn't be ant bang for your buck. * Easy, long wearing application with a natural finish.  I use a darker color as contour. * I knew I would like this product because its Lancome and they rarely if ever do anything poorly, but WOW!!! I loved this stuff!!!! It is so creamy, smooth, easily blended and has multi different uses from concealer to highlighter to all over foundation.  The formula is to die for.  I don't know how they did it but am in love!"

I tried this new teint idole and it is awful. It's a wierd cobstiency and cakey and a total waste of $60+. Customer care also didnt offer to do anything about it. * I bought the foundation in store. I got home found it was expired and returned to a different store for replacement. All of the ones in my shade were expired. The employees were very polite and placed a replacement order. That order arrived Tuesday and was again expired. I contacted Ulta for another replacement which has yet to be processed or shipped with no guarantee that it won't be expired. Check your expiration dates to make sure you aren't paying full price for expired make up and wasting time and gas. * This is THE BEST FOUNDATION I've ever had, and over many years, I have tried just about all of them. An experienced manager at Ulta in Holyoke, 
MA with her knowledge and experience recommended it and tried it on me and it made me look flawless and natural and made my skin look better! Very highly recommend this foundation! * Its super greasy and makes me sweat alot ! I really dont like it * I love how this foundation looks on me.

This thing LASTS, it is not moving. it works in the hot California heat, my prom, and a Green Day concert.

Overall 929/10 * An amazing employee at Ulta showed me this foundation after I said I was looking for something that matched mt skin better. She gave me this and i'm so grateful!!! * I love the finish of this foundation! It's a natural radiant finish that is not too dewy and it doesn't emphasize my fine lines or pores which is amazing! Wearing a primer with it might make it even better but I used it with no primer and I love the way it's looking and holding up. Feels so skin like and thin, even though I applied two layers. My only gripe with it is that plastic box it comes packaged in. It's a complete waste of plastic and it should just be packaged in paperboard like most other foundations are nowadays. * I recently discovered this brand from an olive toned reviewer's recommendation. Ive been thinking I'm olive tone for awhile because even neutral foundations always read either too pink or too orange on me. Never a perfect match.  Then i swatched L2 OLIVE at the store, and i was shocked. It literally blended into my skin so well I could barely see it. I hope they never get rid of this formula. Its perfect. * I recently discovered the about face foundation on tik tokand I can't express how transformative it has been for my makeup routine. This foundation is a game-changer—lightweight yet perfect coverage, it blends seamlessly into my skin, creating a natural finish that lasts all day.

What truly sets it apart is its incredible staying power; I can go from morning classes to evening events without any touch-ups. It's also infused with nourishing ingredients, so my skin feels as good as it looks. The shade range is impressively inclusive, ensuring that everyone can find their perfect match.

I genuinely can't imagine my beauty routine without it. Every time I use it, I fall more in love. Please, please don't ever discontinue this gem! It's become an essential in my makeup bag, and I know I'm not alone in this sentiment. If you're on the fence, just try it! PLEASE buy this so its not discontinued * one of the only foundations that matches my olive tone, and i really like this formula for everyday wear. i'm combination-dry and find it super comfortable, but it could use some powder touch ups throught the day.
 it'd be nice if it was a bit more buildable for coverage, but mostly I wish it came in a pump bottle! i need to mix F2O and L1O and it'd be a lot easier with a pump, also the doefoot sometimes splashes a bit of product and gets the bottle messy pretty quickly * I adore this foundation. I have combo skin and it wear's beautifully. I also get a ton of compliments! Its medium coverage so it doesn't look heavy at all. I will say you can build it up to an extent. I notice if I build it up too much it starts to look cakey so a little goes a long way. I will be buying this again in the future!"

I prepped my skin and used different primers and everytime this product sticks to every dry patch or highlights pores and its got a sticky cake like consistency. I cannot believe how awful it is. I get better coverage and finish from drug store brands. This is not worth it and I wont be buying it again or any of the others * I wanted to love this and I do!  It really does give a great finish on the skin. It is buildable without looking cakey. It is bit on the expensive side but I feel it is worth it for sure. * Looks pretty but very thick can clog pores. Can be a little drying. * This foundation has been a constant on my vanity for a long time now, and it is one of two foundations I use.  This foundation is a hybrid of skincare and makeup and delivers both beautifully!  The formula is a bit thicker as it is a very hydrating formula, but it feels like a soothing hug on the skin!  I notice with this product in particular it seems to sink into the skin as well as snooth itself on top, as to give the skin a snoother appearence wherever texture may be present, which for  many people with some texture such as myself this is a great callout.  I also use my hands to apply my foundation so I cannot say if a brush or sponge would change how it dries down, but it seems to both become one with the skin as well as sit on top slightly. I also have pretty rosy cheeks naturally and I have noticed this product will sooth and calm redness and in my case, no color corrector has ever been needed!  I just love this foundation and hope that this review helps someone trying to decide if its the right one for them!  I highly reccommend at least trying it out or checking out a swatch next time you come accross a tester! * It's very light weight, did return because the color was not a fit for me * I saw all the hype on TikTok about this foundation.  It does not last more than four hours in the Texas heat.  It was a greasy mess.  It smeared, my mascara was even smeared because of this foundation.  It was all over the collar of my shirt.  If I touched my face, the foundation would transfer to my fingers.  There are much better options.  Lesson learned don't listen to ""beauty influencers"" on TT. * i bought this product because it claims to hydrating. not only did it enhance my dry patches, but made them worse throughout the day."

After using it for a few days (before realizing it was the problem), my face brone out in hives and cystic acne that unlike anything I have ever experienced. It was so bad, I didn't leave my house for a week! Now I am left with scars on my face that could take years to recover from. I dont know if it's the ethylhexyl salicylate, alcohol, or mystery frangance in this ish, but I wouldn't wish what happened to me on my worst enemy. Dont touch this stuff with a 10 ft pole!!!

I'm trying not to hold it against ""Dior"" or Ulta, but the fact that they're even letting this stuff stay on the market baffles me. Dont use this. * If you have tried the YSL matte foundation and you're looking for a less expensive version this is it! It smells amazing, has the SPF and stays on matte. I live in AZ where if is hot and this does not feel heavy or cakey. * I decided to try this foundation after seeing reviews on YouTube. But it does not live up to the reviews. It is not transfer proof, and it rubs off so easily. If you touch your face, it's smearing. I may have to go back to bare minerals. * The foundation itself is great. It goes on smooth and it last long it is not greasy or oily. The pump keeps clogging, every few days when I dispense it shoots out at angles, it gets on my clothes, and I have to change last minute. It gets on the wall… its very frustrating. It is good make up, but if I am spending this much money, the packaging should be good too. * This foundation seriously changed the game for me. I have a hormonal IUD and have been on meds to correct the skin issues it has given me, and this has done wonders for controlling oil! I use the Laura Mercier Blurring Primer and this stuff, and I will never use anything else. I manage a drive-thru coffee shop so I see quite a few people daily and I get at LEAST 5-10 compliments a day on my make-up!

I am 39, with dry skin. This sits on your skin like a light moisturizer and gives you a smoother, glowy look. If you get this expecting full coverage, you will be disappointed. Its a tinted moisturizer, not a foundation. It does what it says. I would like it to have SPF as well though. * it looks really nice and set well with powder where it was needed. but you have to use quite a bit of product and it's such a small amount for the price. * Nice coverage which hydrates throughout the day. I like the glow this tint gives to my skin. Much better to use around the eye area when compared to my foundation- less creasing. * Based on all the reviewams it got from ""make up reviewers"" I thought this would be magical. It has good coverage, without being overwheling. But it never set, and it felt sticky without setting it down. 

The shades needed a little bit more range, and they are very different in person than online. 

I will use it up, because of how much I spent on it. 

I habe combo skin. * Goes on the skin beautifully, dewy dreamy buildable coverage, no makeup makeup look, evens texture and tone, gets you through days where you don't want a full beat and want the skin to breath. Just wow! Try it. * This truly is an amazing skin tint. When I first apply it, it looks like nothing, but as you blend it into the skin you can see a visible evening of skin tone and a glowy hydration. It is comfortable to wear. It does not feel cakey or heavy. I can wear it on my undereyes set with an undereye powder, and set everywhere else with a loose powder. I typically prep my skin with a toner (Glow Recipe) and my moisturizer  (Beekman 1802) and do not otherwise prime my skin, but I may change that routine as winter approaches. One of my favorite base products ever! * I am really liking this skin tint. It's a bit thicker than other skin tints I use but very hydrating & smoothing.

It seperates after a few hours on me and it also smudges wuite a bit even with a powder on. * This foundation is not like the previous ones it replaced. It is cakey. Bring back the old ones. * As soon as I applied it on my face, my face turned red and started itching, rashes * I have an olive undertone that has historically made shade matching a nightmare, and my skin is also really oily so foundation almost always ends up breaking apart or slipping off. The UD Face Bond is one of very few that holds up against my oiliness and the ONLY one that both holds up AND matches my skin undertone that I've tried. I have worn this multiple times for 12+ hour days at work, and once for 17 hours as a bridesmaid running around at a wedding in the rain. I did blot my face for the wedding at around the 14 hour mark but I honestly could've gotten away without it. 

This foundation probably would not work on those without oily skin - I can imagine that it would feel really drying if you're not endowed with an oil slick face like I am, especially since it has alcohol pretty prominently in the ingredients. But for the very oily, this is definitely worth a try. * I've been an Urban Decay foundation believer for over 10 years. Although it can be frustrating when a formula is discontinued (I started with the original Naked foundation, which changed to Stay Naked, which is now seemingly being phased out.) I will say that Urban Decay delivers in helping customers find a suitable shade match with their new formulas. 
This formula is lightweight, not heavy or greasy, and blends seamlessly. I continue to be an Urban Decay believer. I have tried other brands and they simply don't compare to the quality * This product  is my first time l buy that brand they  were out of the product  l buy . * I love this. It is waterproof the only thing is it startsn ""cracking"" by end of day. I don't set it with anything which could be the problem I also have dry skin and it does settle there. The coverage is perfect and I just use more moustierizer in the morning. 💖"

But serously this beautiful powder is by far the best powder foundation i have ever tried and i have tried nearly all of them. You can sheer it out for a set or finish or pack it on for a full coverage moment. All wirhout looking dry or cakey. It is the first powder i don't immediately reach for a setting spray to ""melt"" it. You can. But you dont have to. This conpany is also on my good list for being loudly and proudly prochoice. Love it. * I'm a powder foundation junky. I hate liquid foundation so much. So I always use powder foundation. The reason I LOVE this foundations are 1) long lasting wear 2) doesn't look cakey at all 3) but still has great coverage without looking heavy 4) color matches my skin tone very well. I have tried from cheap to high end ones and I say this is one of the best. I have one more favorite but I'm keeping it as my beauty secret! * I'm in my late 30s and was looking for a powder that wouldn't sink into my fine lines, and lasted. This was not it. The coverage is too transparent, so you have to use a lot of get better coverage, and then it doesn't have any staying power. Maybe it's my skin or my primer that doesn't work well with it, but for the price I wasn't impressed. * I have used PUR Cosmetics pressed powder foundation for 5+ years, but it has retinol in it and I'm pregnant. I tried several other brands of powder foundations (Bare Minerals, Lancome, Maybelline) and they all looked so patchy, cakey, and horrible. I tried this as a last-ditch effort, and I'm so glad I did! This is a fantastic pressed powder foundation. It applies easily, doesn't look patchy, doesn't look cakey, doesn't settle into my fine lines, and provides decent light/medium coverage. This has a very nice semi-matte finish, and looks very natural on the skin with a feather-light texture. I will say PUR's product offers a little more coverage in my opinion, but this product is still amazing. I love the ingredients, and I love the refillable compact concept. I highly recommend this! I have combination, acne prone skin and this did not cause breakouts for me. * I originally purchased the kit on the JE website, then came back to Ulta.com to get my refill. This is the only foundation I've ever actually used up!!! I have rosacea and wear glasses, so my tzone does get shiny and requires a small touchup at midday. Some tips:
-use a primer of some kind, either Jane's or another that you like.
-get a retractable travel brush (I use the one from Eco Tools) this is great for touchups and when I need more coverage, I twist the brush only halfway (making it denser) which gives more coverage for my cheeks because I have rosacea. If you need heavy coverage, you are going to want a dense brush to sort of pack it on in downward patting strokes. 
DO NOT swirl/buff...this is not the other mineral powder. different formulas work differently. 
  * This perfectly matches my skin tone. It's very difficult to see when I swab it on my face to see the color.  Nothing  else has ever matched like this. I have been using it for about 8 years. I have normal to dry skin and this gives a natural look. * Initially I didn't like this powder. Was accustomed to fuller coverage powder foundations and i think the shade i chose was a bit light. Decided to use it as a setting powder over a tinted moisturizer because i had a sample of a good tinted moisturizer i wanted to try. I really only wanted to use it up so my money wasn't wasted. This is where i fell in love. It's very good at blurring and I found that it was better than the 100 different setting powders I'd used. I'm a little surprised about the reviews that mentioned cracking because this is the ONLY powder I've ever had in 35 years (in my 50s) that i used completely. Even the little edges stayed in place until they were completely gone. Weird. I can only guess it's because i never bought the hard case to put it in because I initially didn't love it. It stayed in the plastic refill case until ENTIRELY gone."

I was suprised that the 230N matched my skin, cause im a medium skin tone. This is listed as being very light but it matched skin perfectly. I really love the coverage and would purchase again. * I loved this foundation it gave me this beautiful Glam and  it gave me this full confident look im so inlove * I really love this product. It's light and stays on. * I am very confused by the positive reviews for this, especially the ones by ladies with mature skin. This foundation is pretty bad. like another reviewer, I have tried using this in every way I can think of. With different primers, setting sprays, etc. It has so many issues. Makes my pores look huge even with blurring primers, settles into my smile and one forehead line so bad. It's super cakey and slides off the face. Like I was in shock the first time I wore it, it looked ok in my beauty room but once I stepped in the light, I looked insane. I will try it. Couple of more times but I'll have to give up after that. * I really enjoyed using this foundation. I found the coverage to be very buildable so I could get a full if I wanted to! It is a luminous finish so I powder the areas that I need to. I also didn't find it to be too heavy and I got a lot of compliments on my skin. * Im 46 so wrinkles and pores is a thing. This foundation works better than my maybelline skin tint, Lancôme ultra wear, elf satin & camo, misha bb cream. Its very skin like but w/ coverage, doesnt settle in lines, erases pores! Wears all day, i lightly set it w/ elf radiance setting powder & lovk it in w/ elfs glycerin setting spray, chefs kiss its so pretty on my skin. If it gets shiny throughout the day maybe 1/2 during a 12 hr shift i lightly pat it w/ hourglass new compact powder trust me you wont regret especially mature ladies. * I love this product. It is gorgeous on the skin. I'm oily and it still looks great. Good price on it."

Associate was knowledgeable and helpful. * I have been using this for years and it's the best foundation I've ever used! Great coverage, never looks cakey, and always get compliments on my skin.

I live in a dry state and have struggled with my skin drying out - the hydrating properties leave my skin glowing! I'm also at a higher elevation and credit the sun protection properties with protecting my skin in a way that it has slowed wrinkles, fine lines, and sun damage!

I've also suffered from comedonal acne in the past but this has never caused a reaction.

I will be absolutely devastated if this is ever discontinued. It is my favorite and I can't even fathom using anything else. * At first, I was happy to have found a foundation in a light enough tone, and was impressed by how well it matched and covered up my bit of acne. However, as I wore it, I noticed my acne getting worse day by day. It was doing a great job coverage-wise, but I kept breaking out more and more until I stopped using it. After I stopped, my acne calmed down, leaving me with the same issue as before.. * This foundation matches my skin perfectly. Hides all my imperfections and dark spots as well. * I love Tarte products, this foundation is the best! * I was unfamiliar with the rate brand until I went into the Ulta store to select a new foundation. I was looking for a lightweight foundation with a dewy finish, and was directed to the Tarte representative. She did a fantastic job helping me select the right shade (in the natural light by the window). I can't say enough good things about this foundation. The first day I wore it, my friends commented how glowing my skin looked! It's not too heavy, and I love how it feels on my skin. I'm now a Tarte foundation convert! * I think this is my new Holy grail. Great coverage and great application."

Tula's very light warm nails it. I use it on top of my daily SPF moisturizer and it's the right, light coverage i was looking for. It covers light imperfections, lessens my undereye circles, and reduces redness. Totally recommend! * Very happy I got a sample and didn't purchase this product. First off it doesn't cover any redness, or even out tone at all. It had a strong smell like zinc oxide and was very hard to apply, very pasty and sticky. And the worst part it darkened and turned orange after about 15 minutes. Yuck. * Caused the ""Great Outbreak"" of 2024. Ive never had pimples this size or in the places they poped up! * I started using this product a few months ago. My skin is sensitive to many products but this was one has not caused any unusal breakouts. This product is moisturizing without feeling heavy. It provides moderrate coverage and looks natural! I have definitely received positive skin comments wearing this stuff! I definitely intend on continuing to purchase this moisturizer! * Got this in a subscription box, but i will repurchase it. I love the finish on this on my dry, aging skin. It does need to be set with a powder or will remain a little tacky, but afterwards it looks gorgeous. * Light and covers good * Product feels light with some light tint coverage as well."

It feels so silky going on. It blends really easy. * Does anyone have dupe recommendations for the original formula in other brands? I'll be switching after trying this reformulation. It's really awful, listen to all the bad reviews! 

The new formula is no comparison to the original. Very greasy, even on dry skin. Separated within an hour of wear, accentuated poors & fine lines, and left dry patches looking flakey. Does NOT provide full coverage, even after a few passes of attempting to build the coverage (in vain). Transfers very easily, even after setting with powder. This formula never set on my skin and just felt gross. * Ive been using Mac for years. And this new stuff is horrile. My face looks cakey doesnt stay on, just rubs off. The old stuff used ti be sweat proof. But not anymore. * I gave this 5 stars several months ago when I first bought it, because the first time I used it it really did seem to look nice and last. I don't know what changed but I don't like wearing it anymore, it definitely oxidizes & my face looks greasy after just a couple hours. I keep having to powder it. It also separates a lot, especially on my forehead and it's kind of drying. I'm now searching for a new foundation. Double Wear lasts better but dries me out and ends up looking chalky. * NONE, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, USING IT FOR YEARS. * Sinc they changed the formula it's terrible unfortunately. I have been using this since I was 15 and it has never failed me, until I bought this 3 weeks ago in the new pump bottle, also the new formula. Slightly devastated, it sits nothing like it did before on the skin, it does not matter whether you use the most expensive quality primer, setting powder, spray, all of it can't fix the awful quality of the new formula, and trust me, I tried it all in the 3 weeks hoping maybe...but it's just awful. So bad I literally called Mac and left them a phone review because please give us back what we loved. Until then they've lost a literal lifetime customer, I'm sorry comrades, tight the good fight, try it yourself side by side your old formula if you have some still, then spam Mac with your reviews until they change it back, please, can't we just have this one thing in this timeline?"

I exfoliate daily, moisturize after serum and use this as my foundation. It completely evens out my skin tone and adds a subtle glow. I use medium. Its slighty warmer than my natural tone and perfectly watms up my skin. Doesnt crack or cake into pores and with a nice setting powder over top , my skin looks great. I tried to go back to a heavier foundation on a night i wqs going out and regretted the entire night. Especially after a few hours. I wont be without this new brilliant product from chanel. * I wore this on my wedding day instead of my foundation (a last minute decision, lol) and it was just a dream. It has this magical way of spreading pigment without sinking into texture or lines, and it gives a beautiful glow. I will buy this forever! * I had high hopes for this one but was left a bit disappointed.  Very very lightweight with barely any coverage. A slight hint of tint, not sticky.  It did feel nice on the skin. I use it as a base to start, which I never do.  Other less expensive lumi products, that can be worn alone are better for me. * A tinted water gel that can give you a glass skin look (at least it did for me). For it to work for you, you need to have good skin. In French culture (since this is Chanel), skin care comes first and makeup enhance the beauty. This is exactly what this product is about. If you are looking for coverage, then this is not the product for you. But if you are looking for no-makeup-makeup, then this is it. * This stuff is magic. It's super low coverage and leightweight, yet somehow makes a huge impact on the look and feel of my skin. I have late 30's normal-to-dehydrated fair skin with plenty of freckles and hyperpigmentation. This plumps my skin like crazy, the tiny tint is somehow enough to tone down redness and the finish is flawless, like a filter without looking makeup-y. It's totally undetectable and just looks like you're having a great skin day. Seriously magic and I'm pumped that Ulta now carries it, because it's not cheap and Ulta's rewards are SO much better than any other retailer. I have only two criticisms of this product: it is fragranced with the classic Chanel scent, and the packaging is massive for the volume of product you get. Not at all travel friendly. So when I travel, I bring the complexion touch product, which is very similar but slightly more pigmented. Comes in much more reasonable packaging and is unscented. I do like this product better than the complexion touch, however. Something about it just looks more magical on my skin. It has become my all-time favorite holy grail base product. * Foundations were looking quite funky on my 40-year-old skin and I was needing some thing that mesh well with my new aging skin, and this is absolutely it. It doesn't settle in cracks/crevaces wears beautifully. * I will start by saying that I DESPISE the feeling of foundation. I use to wear full coverage foundation on a daily basis and then stopped for about 2-3 years. This water tint re-introduced me to the foundation world. It's so breathable on my skin and TRULY has the no makeup look (this is my preference). If you're wanting something that's full coverage for blemishes then I wouldn't choose this product. If 
you need it for evening out your skin tone, covering redness, and just overall looking a little more put together lol, then this is the stuff! I apply it with my fingers. I do a cream blush before I apply to have a nice glow peaking through the foundation. Just set it with a translucent powder and ta-daa!"

The perfect mid coverage for dry skin.

It looks like my skin but better, very hydrating and the coverage is buildable . Ive been using this for years haven't found anything else like it. * I don't write reviews often but this makeup is awful! it applied nice at first but after a few hours it looked horrible, cakes, separating and completely drying to my already dry skin. I wouldn't recommend this foundation to anyone. * I had this brand and shade of foundation applied as a makeup demo and have have used it ever since. I love the coverage and the color which compliments my skin. * I love this foundation. It matches my skin tone perfectly. I have alot if red in my face due to flushing from an illness I have and it covers it up perfectly. I would recommend this product to anyone. It stays put after it's on so you don't have to reapply. * The ranges of darker colors is lacking. The deepest shade was too deep. The shade up, the color i got, oxides to a flat muddy brown.

This gave me giant deep zits and i was still oily soon after applying even with primers. I tried silicone and water/dimethicone based primers bc I really want this to work as the shade 015 was a perfect match for my fair neutral/slightly cool tone. I've never had a more perfect color match than this apple balm foundation but the acne was shocking. I even took a break to clear up my skin and the next time i tried i broke out the next morning. Clinique skin care does this to me too and i may be sensitive to silicone but not sure what the problem is. Benefit silicone primer doesn't bother me fwiw * I took a break from using this foundation to try out different formulas (serum, liquid) and keep coming back to it as my perfect choice. lightweight, even application that can easily be buffed in with a fluffy brush. most products applied on top of the foundation blend perfectly instead of pulling up the foundation under and it doesn't rub off under my mask! 
I use powder to prime and spray to set * This product is amazing for people with dry skin or for very fair and light people. always looks airbrushed and easy to apply/blend.

however
-it is expensive
-only sells in red or yellow undertone which means u NEED to buy two and mix 

so even though this is literally the best foundation its cery expensive and the shade range is annoying

now in terms of transfer, if u have a good setting powder and a good fixing spray i dint see why this would happen vut i also dont gave oily skin so maybe thats the big determining factor * Love this makeup and all producthe maker. maker. * it doesn't oxidize so that's cool but it slides right off after a few hours and gets all patchey and cakey.

It does it job. Not for acne girlies as in won't cover dark spots or acne so you have to color correct first. But won't break you out. This is light coverage, skin like. There are many other foundations like this and for cheaper. * I love Chanel foundation! It is the best! I have tried others and I always go back to Chanel! It is full coverage light meaning it doesn't feel heavy on your face and smooth.  I have bought it for years and only changed to try something new that has come out. I always go back to Chanel! * I agree with the other review that said that it doesn't stay. I only had it on for like 2 hours but it faded on my face. It's Autumn, so I'm not even that oily and the temps aren't hot. Also any time I accidentally touched my face, it got all over my fingers and erased the foundation. I get that light foundations usually don't have the chemicals that make matte foundations more transfer-resistant, but I shouldn't have to make sure nothing touches my face even the slightest bit all day, not if you claim to be long-wearing.

It also just didn't look nice enough regardless of its flaws to be worth the price. I didn't expect my skin to look like it was filtered, but it certainly didn't look nearly as nice as other reviewers said.

I got the lightest shade BD00 and it was too yellow. I have neutral skin and 1 layer is flexible enough to pull off, but more than that it was really yellow.

I really wanted to love it as a skincare foundation but not for a performance this poor. * I wanted something light, build able, moisturizing and that would smooth out my pores & wrinkles. It's my go to! Age 45! * If you have dry skin and wants to try different look, then you will find it in Chanel Healthy Glow. Use a sponge/beauty blender to use it as a tinted moisturizer; use a brush for heavier coverage; if you want an airbrush look, add powder. This is perfect for all year long. My holy grail! * I have never been able to wear liquid foundations because they have all been either too yellow or too pink. B00 is PERFECT for anyone who is neutral cool. I have super sensitive and dry skin and I tried this on a whim to see how it would up… I didn't use a primer and it it lasted all day through work without touch-ups. all I used to set was the benefit setting spray and a setting powder.

I can even add a little more in spots that need it and they just disappear! My only complaint is for them to change the bottle. I am almost out of product, but i can tell there is soooo much more leftover on the sides of the bottle. The problem is that it's impossible to scrape it due to the doe foot applicator fitting through such a narrow hole. * I actually had an ulta employee try this on me in the store and my daughter was stunned at how good it looked. I have malasma and it really evened me out , my daughter said she never has seen my skin look that good. I hate heavy makeup and I really only use this for under my eyes and over my cheeks where my malasma is. , more as a concealer. It works very well. I may try their spf tint too. I recommend this. * This is my everyday go to foundation! Gives me great coverage and I love that it has skincare built in it. The ingredients are clean and I've noticed my skin feels and looks so much better since I started using this. I'm on my second bottle and swear by this stuff. * Absolutely flawless. I can wear it sheer or full coverage! Not sticky, not cakey!!! I also love the primer it makes my skin super smooth and prolongs the make up even more ! Filter in a bottle ! (Use the pur brush as well) * holy grail foundation, i will never but another again 😍😍😍😍 * I've tried many foundations and have had incredible difficulty finding one that matched my skin tone (pale neutral) and didn't oxidize.  This foundation is perfection (shade LN2).  The color stays true and doesn't oxidize throughout the day as so many foundations have done on my skin.

It has a natural finish, sits very smoothly on and blends easily into my combination skin without emphasizing dry patches, lines, or pores.  My skin is fairly reactive, and I've had no negative reactions to this foundation.  The coverage is buildable and so good that I no longer have to wear concealer.  I've found that using a setting powder does help it wear throughout the day, but it's still nice even without.  I hope PUR continues to make this foundation forever! * also love it because shade TN3 is a perfect color match for my skin tone."

The color matches my light olive complexion (Figi), it goes on smoothly (I use a brush), my skin looks flawless.  After a few minutes I don't even feel like I have foundation on, my skin feels velvety.  This foundation is long lasting with great buildable coverage. * I am 53 and have been looking for a foundation that helps take a fee years off my face..I found it finally!! Blends beautifully with my brush, doesn't settle into fine lines and reduces pores. The color match is perfect! I have never bought a Nars product till now, but I am now a repeat customer! * Ive been using Nars for years. I have tried other foundations but i always end up coming back to Nars. I always get complements on my skin when i use this foundation. It sets very naturally. * I'm not gonna lie, this foundation is really, really bad. I'm using the shade Oslo which is a perfect match but this foundation somehow just smears all over my face while highlighting my pores/texture and breaks down after an hour or two. It just does not want to sit properly no matter what I do. I've tried using a brush, beauty blender, my hands, puffs and it doesn't make a difference. Even with prepping my skin (dry skin with sometimes oily tzone) - I've done my full skincare routine, minimal routine and no routine and this foundation somehow behaves the same. Setting spray and a translucent powder also do not help. It's just not good no matter what I do, which is extremely disappointing. * I tried this foundation because Loreal Infallable did not last long on my oily skin, and Tarte Amazonian Clay was cakey and made my pores and lines very visible. I applied Smashbox Mattying Primer on my face, then blended the NARS foundation with a sponge. I finished with Maybelline finishing powder. My makeup lasted all night and I looked younger because of the great coverage. I highly recommend this foundation if you have combo or oily skin, but definitely use a good matte primer! * My new favorite foundation! It matches my skin perfectly and blends so well with high coverage as well. It feels great on my skin!"

I have acne scars very large pores deep smile lines that collect the makeup.... And I'm 53. All the nightmares!!!!  This foundation!!!  I mean common!!!  It covered everything!  It blurred the pores on my nose, which nothing ever has, it didn't settle it those deep lines, even the ones in the corner of my mouth!!!  I looked Dewey all day!  I felt like I was wearing nothing. It wasn't even the right shade cause they were out but I just used a bit of bronzer and omg perfection!!  I will never ever use anything else. Yes it's a bit fragrant but that disappears in a few hours no big deal. * It is light with good coverage...looks very natural! * I would like to give 3.5 stars if i could but it isnt an option and i think it deserves more than 3… BUT its nothing spectacular by any means - the CC cream was phenomenal and wheb they discontinued it I was hoping for soemthing that  that lit my skin like that did … this doesnt. Its not even that it doesnt have the coverage (i wasnt looking for that) just that healthy glow fresh face look that Cc cream gave me… i will keep it and use it because it does feel nice, smells like chanel and has spf … but I wont buy it again ever. * After 40, most foundations accentuate every sign of aging, until now. The finish is perfection and lasts all day - no caking, creasing or dry patches. My skin never feels dry, just comfortable. I only wish that there were more cool shades available. * Feels so comfortable, coverage is light with a beautiful finish!  Love this product. * Used la roche tinted sunscreen instead. 42 was too dark on me. Will be returning * I bought this on a whim just to try, and I was pleasantly surprised! The first time I tried it I was in a rush, so I actually used my fingers to apply it! The coverage was matte, and smooth! It covered up all my redness in one smooth pass! I love the flawless, light coverage. It's perfect for those no makeup makeup days! I am a mom, so some days I don't have a lot of time to get ready and this gives me that sense of security. I'm definitely impressed with this foundation. The price can be a little bit hefty, but that's what comes with a luxury product! All in all, I will keep this on hand and repurchase as I run out !"

I love the coverage of this product and how comfortable it feels in my skin. A little goes a long way so I don't burn through the product either. * I got this in the color fair. It has great coverage for my acne and redness, it also does a great job moisturizing my dry skin (even in the winter!). The SPF is a very welcome bonus a well! There is little to no scent that could be perceived as offensive (and I'm very sensitive to scents). Definitely a safe repurchase. * I enjoyed using this tinted moisturizer for sure. The color match is amazing and I like the medium buildable coverage. It lasts all night. Definitely like that it has SPF 25 built into it for sun protection. Also feeling that it's hyaluronic acid powered along with other ingredients that are good for the skin. It also gives a certain glow to the skin. I recommend this so much that I already bought backups for when I finish this! * Oxidizes to be very orange, and the medium shade was already very warm toned. The consistency feels like a serum, which at least does not look cakey. There is no scent. Not sure if I will apply heavy enough to get any sun protection. * A little bit goes a long way with this, pretty close to full coverage. It definitely has a very dewy/shiny finish and is sort of sticky so its not my favorite consistency. * This is a great tinted moisturizer! The coverage is perfect, it goes on smoothly and blends in well. It looks like I'm wearing foundation but I'm not! The color matched well, also. I recommend it!

*received complimentary for testing purposes * I like the finish and the coverage of the moisturizer. I wish the bottle was different because if I open it when I have it sitting up, the product immediately starts coming out (including into the cap) which leads to some waste."

Great coverage without settling in lines. Very natural looking.  You can't tell you have foundation on it just looks like you have great skin. * The foundation is great. The pump for it is just terrible. Gets stuck after every pump. * This foundation looks great for maybe 3 minds after application.  I've tried everything to get it to stay. It settles into fine lines making them appear bigger, loss cakey, seperates, and feels disgusting.  0 stars if I could. * I love this foundaton !!! I was hesitant at first since i rarely wore make up and got it to wear for my sisters wedding but i got loads of compliments and the shade matched my skin perfectly and i didnt look like a cheeto ! * I loved the color and feel and was excited about the skin benefits. However, after each time Ive worn it Ive broken out the next day. I have always had sensitive skin, but Im also in my late 30's and hardly ever break our or have a skin blemish so unfortunately Im sure it was this product that caused it. * The foundation is really good for mature dry skin.

I got because they were out of the other foundation I wanted and needed for a trip. It scans horribly on the yuka app and I do not like any sunscreens in my foundation. I will be returning as it doesn't wear how I would've expected. * I got this as a free sample and gave it a try. Its very light/ sheer coverage. This claims to last 12 hrs or so. I was excited because it seems like it has great benefits and added sunscreen. At the end of the day, it was def oily and I needed face powder. I have a clear face with no acne problems, but after a day of use this caused pustules on my skin! So upset by this cause I wasnt breaking out before.. I wanted to love this product but it completely missed the mark. * it was very oily.    Would like very much to be refunded * Dewy and radiant buildable coverage. Glides on easily even over dry and patchy skin. Does not settle into fine lines.  Once set with powder it and stays put, in dry or humidity climate. Feels light, true with the serum claim. Has added skin protection and benefits. Did not irritate my sensitive complextion. The 0 and 1 colors matched well on my  pale neutral skin tone. * This color was a perfect match for my skin tone, which isn't always easy to find. I liked that it had spf just to up my coverage in the summer. However it has a thick and sticky texture that is hard to apply. I tried using my fingers without success coverage was splotchy and showed a lot of texture. Same problem when applying with a brush. Better coverage, but the coverage broke up halfway theough the day, additionally the texture was awful. I dont have any acne scarring or fine lines or wrinkles where texture was visible. * This is a great lightweight serum foundation for the skin just not for those who wants a natural matte look. I have oily to dry skin. I never realized i had dry patches until I used this product. It applied beautifully but within the hour i noticed it cling and accentuate dry patches. * I recently left Estee Lauder and tried a few other makeup brands, but this serum pulled me back. Im so happy i got this! It is perfect! Good coverage but light too! You wont be disappointed! I an 56 and this is great for my imperfections!"

This foundation doesnt need a primer, it looks better without . Last all day and it is smooth . One of my favorite ones so far and you can not beat the price . * Very natural * This is my everyday foundation. this is magic in a bottle. I literally use half a pump to do my makeup and it lasts me all day. I love morphe products so much * So light weight and buildable coverage. Definitely get shade matched in the store because I tried a shade and it oxidized. Ended up getting a lighter and it matches perfected. I sweated in the foundation and it was still in tact!

It makes my skin look like skin, just perfected!! It does not look like I have makeup on! It evens out my skintone and adds the perfect amount of coverage for every day, especially during hot summer days. I bought this because I was on the hunt for something that would be lighter and not melt off my face in a gross cakey way in the heat, and this is it!! I wish I tried it sooner!! * As a very oily girl, i hate to say but i am disappointed. The doible wear is great for oily skin but i needed something light coverage and matte at the same time. I needed something to wear to work everyday. Unfortunately, my oily skin pertruded after a two hours snd i had to pat down my skin. So i recommend if you have you combo skin but for oily skin not necessarily. * I'm on the fence. Love the finish very natural. Doesn't settle in lines and wrinkles. Very runny and thin seems to take a lot of product to produce a full face coverage.  My 70yo skin on nose is breaking out a bit and this is only new product I am using so I'm just not sure  will keep trying * I really enjoy using this foundation. It is so lightweight, a perfect color match, and wears nicely throughout the day. It doesnt get overly oily/shiny in my T-zone where I experience that the most. Minimal setting into my fine lines and wrinkles - even less when I prep with a primer. 

I highly recommend! * I have dry skin and the regular estee lauder foundation wasnt for me. However, this one worked well. It's lightweight and still covers the small red and dark spots but I would not recommend it to someone looking for a full coverage. * For reference, I have fair warm toned, moderately oily skin. I usually wear 1.05 in Smashbox Studio Skin, and NC15 in MAC Waterweight. I wear 1n2 Ecru in this foundation. I love love this foundation. It is beautiful on, smooth, light coverage. I don't have a lot of dark spots or acne issues. I do have freckles and some redness, but not crazy. This coverage is perfect for me for daily wear. It plays with my other products. I don't get weird grainy break down around my nose, chin, and under my glasses at the bridge of my nose like I do with other foundations. It will last my 16 hour day and still look great, no fading or disappearing act. If you need full coverage, you can skip this one but if you just need an even out with a natural look, this is your girl. I thought Fenty EZ Dropz were the best thing ever until I tried this foundation, and now I won't touch the EZ Dropz again. * I go to a huge college in the South where it is often above 100 degrees outside, and I will wear this to football games and sit out in the direct sunlight and sweat for hours and it still looks just as good post game as when I put it on! I love this product and swear by it! It is expensive but I think it is worth the price. My only complaint is that I think they could give you a little more product for the price point, but the product itself is just so great I won't stop buying it!"

My skin tends to be rosacea prone/redness prone esp as a fair skinned person. I also get quite dry and flaky so the last thing I want in a foundation is for it to accentuate any patchy areas or flakes. I tested this formula out in Ulta back in March and have been using it on and off over the last 7 months. I really enjoy it as it is very hydrating once you complete your skin prep, you can apply very little- as it goes a long way: and you can blend it out perfectly with a brush or a sponge; even your fingers if needed. I personally, prefer a brush. The only con is that 10 was a bit too light and 20 was a little too dark of an undertone for me-but works for my skin tone in the summer. It's not SUPER noticeable, but I tend to go for more of a ""pinky"" undertone, so more in between shades would be nice. I like how this gives you a natural, dewy look and you are able to build up as needed without looking cakey. Once your face is complete, it wears extremely well IMO, and doesnt settle into any lines that I've noticed. It's a great option and I'm impressed, would definitely recommend to anyone on the fence thinking about it. Just make sure you get the correct color match. :) * Amazing coverage, no creasing, no smudging. Doesn't feel like anything on my face. * Amazing beautiful coversge for dry skin. However its kind of thick and can cause breakouts. Its also easily transferable. Must use a setting powder or spray if you dont want it getting on anything. I do still love the coverage though.  Needs more shade options too * Ive used a few tinted moisturizers (morphe and milk) and I would consider this as a foundation thats medium coverage. This is comparable to Born This Way original but lighter. I have been loyal to Born This Way Matte since it came out since its more bulletproof than the original formula but I always loved how the original finishes on my face - it just doesnt last as long. However, this is just like the original and is my new go to! It lasts just as long as the Matte but finishes like the BTW original. * this is my all time favorite. I have combination skin so I usually have problems with foundation separating or drying out my skin not this one it looks perfect for hours including Mt best friends outdoor wedding in south louisiana in August. I was sweating bullets and it stayed perfect all night 10000/10 * I have dry skin that's not sensitive at all. I put this on and my face started itching shortly after applying it. The finish isn't as good as my tarte bb cream but it isn't bad. This isn't quite as builda le as I'd of wantedit but unfortunately I'm taking it back. * This is the best tinted moisturizer ive found and ive tried a lot. I've been using it for several months. It's medium coverage and can be built up. It blurs my pores and has a dewy finish. My skin looks great and its not cakey at all. I use a beauty blender to apply it. It doesn't take much product as a little goes a long way. If you're looking for medium coverage, dewy finish and blurring effect, give this a try."

I do use a setting powder so everything stays put all day * I have dry skin quite often because acne medication. This is the best I've found that doesn't flake and stick to my dry patches. I use a wet sponge to apply it. * As of summer 2024, I've been using this foundation for over two years on my ""mature"" 47 yo skin. It looks great and preforms well with any skincare I've ever worn underneath, including different sunscreens. (PSA - this has SPF but shouldn't be relied upon as your only SPF in a day.) Looks great. The color range seems completely constant across the brand. So if you started with the Doublewear Stay in Place and were looking for something lighter and more natural finish, you can choose your ""usual"" shade. * I have worn the double wear sheer foundation in dessert beige for years. They changed it so much; it is hardly the same foundation now. The double wear in full coverage is too much for aging skin (I find). I looked at the serum tint and it was clearly too oily for me and too sheer. The hydra rescue, on the other hand, is the new deal. A lot of sun protection, just enough coverage. And most importantly I finally matched the color the right way and that is to my neck. Turns out I was never desert beige, I am exactly Ecru. Who knew! It can look flaky if you don't have a moisturized enough base. Also, start with a smaller amount, then build up coverage as needed to avoid caking. Other than that, it stays on and does not easily transfer. * I love the formula. It's highly pigmented so a thin layer is plenty, you don't feel like you're wearing anything. The only problem is the tube it's in is the worst foundation container I've ever had. I dismissed other reviews of people complaining bc I thought maybe it was user error, I was wrong. The pump leaks everywhere leaving a huge mess every time you use it. * This product is very runny, which I read in the reviews.  It doesn't take a lot of product to cover, and I really like the color (Fresco) and how it disappears after application.  My face feels hydrated most of the day after use.  I did detect a slight odor, but it was very faint, and it goes away quickly.  You just have to be careful, removing it from the tube.  Plan on it being a little messy.  I do like it so far, and it gives me a natural look. * Great product"

I have BR42 and it makes my face look bright - I love the color. * I've really tried to like this makeup but after continually trying it still burns and by the afternoon my face has flaky peeling patches. * The only time I get compliments on my skin is when I'm wearing this. It's expensive but lasts a long time and a little goes a long way. Its the perfect weight for me—light to medium coverage. * I like this foundation but I don't love it especially for the price. I don't find it luminous at all; a natural finish at best. I enjoy it more if I add a little oil when applying. It's a solid medium coverage but almost leans slightly matte to me. I had a very difficult time finding the right shade. There really wasn't a great match for me but BD21 was acceptable. I have the same shade in the Healthy Glow foundation but the shade differs with the formula. I like the Healthy Glow better as it looks more natural and it's less expensive. Still on the fence about this one. Might not be glowy enough for me. * Products gives great coverage while still feeling light on your skin. * Love this smoothing long wear foundation! * This is my second time purchasing this foundation.  I love it! Even at 56, my skin is still oily.  This foundation is not too heavy and does not break out my skin.  My only complaint is the bottle.

Attempting to build your coverage feels like decades, the foundation does not spread and blend well. Very splotchy after only a few hours and dry and flaky looking. Takes a lot longer to oxidize as well and for the true color to come through. 

I wore studio fix religiously for so long and unfortunately Smashbox has lost a customer. * I've been looking for the right shade and I've finally found it.

Smashbox Always On was the perfect solution! * best foundation for oily skin * I used Studio Skin for many years. The new formula is HORRIBLE. It makes my skin look worse than if I don't wear foundation at all. It's dry, streaky and the color closest to the one I used for Studio Skin makes me look like a Dorito. I switched over to Estee Lauder now because I found a great new foundation there. Bye bye, Smashbox. * I have been searching for a long wear foundation for my oily skin that holds up in the summer heat and looks great as an everyday work foundation. I  bfe tried so many foundations and many high end, I am allergic to sunscreen and most foundations melt off me in the heat. This is it! It looks great, gives me great medium coverage and i can build it up if needed or im having a rough skin day. The color is a great match and I haven't stopped wearing it since I got it.

It has great coverage for a skin tint, and looks so nice on the skin. However, shortly after using it I started getting deep cystic acne along my cheeks and jawline. I didn't think it was this at first, I actually thought it was my retinol. I pulled back on everything for a few weeks to let my skin clear. After about three weeks, I used this once again while on vacation. I woke up the next day with 2 new painful cysts and pimples around my chin. It's important to note that I double cleanse every night, and on days that I wear makeup I TRIPLE cleanse. It makes me sad to have to toss this out, but the acne and scarring this has caused is definitely not worth it. :( * This is my favorite skin tint EVER! Its good for every day use and has pretty hood coverage. my only issue is the packaging, its in a serum like dropper bottle. i find it to be really annoying, and it does leak really bad if you dont put the lid on REALLY tight. Ive also had the dropper part break of in the bottle! * I want to love this makeup so much, but it is definitely the cause of my breakouts. I gave it one last try when my skin was clear, and sure enough, at night when I washed my face, it was covered in red bumps. Like the annoying, everywhere, red, pesky pimples. The skin tint is soo pretty on though, so I'm sad to have to stop using it. If you aren't acne prone, give it a try. If you are acne prone, it's (unfortunately) probably not worth it! * I love this skin tint!!! I have dry skin and this applies flawlessly! Ive always applied foundation products with my fingers and do with this one as well. It has moderate to full coverage even with a thin serumy texture and a beautiful pearlescent. It lasts all day and looks the same on application as the end of the day. Highly recommend! also, shade matches perfectly for me. * I really like this foundation. I hate the dropper and I wish they were sealed. They get opened at the store and are a mess when you want to buy them. I ordered this online so it was nice and clean. The coverage is good and it does last all day. I ordered a pump and it is much better.

For being someone who likes a more natural look, this is perfect! Coverage is buildable and it makes my skin look glowy all day. The formula makes it so easy to blend."

Light coverage but also buildable. I use one pump amd than do a powder foundation by maybelline and lasts all day. This may not cover acne prone skin, but it definitely helped a little with redness on my cheeks. A good product all around, it doesnt feel heavy. * I love this foundation and have used it for years! The shade I use matches me perfectly and the liquid is very blendable and feels light on my skin. I only have one complaint and its about the pump. I miss the old screw-on caps! The pump wastes so much product because you can't really control how much is coming out and can't get all of the liquid out especially if you're getting close to the bottom and shake it up. With the old screw-on cap, you had control of how much you want to get out and you could get all of the product out. The only downfall of that was possibly dropping the bottom, but I waste so much product and have to buy more often which is just messed up L'Oreal. I love this product though and will stick with it so long as the formula and color stay the same. * It is a very much affordable foundation and feels smooth on the skin. I like it very much because it blends almost perfectly on my skin * Ive tried so many foundations, high end and cheap, and this is one of the best hands down! It stays on 13+ hours, no creases, doesn't ever look oily! Just so good! * Ive been usinf this for 3 weeks and my skin has gotten OILIER if possible. Completelt reflective after an hour or 2 all around my tzone. And is does NOT stay on well. I use with estee lauder primer because i had some left AND i use settinf spray and powder around my nose and forehead. Would not recommend. * This works surprisingly well for my oily skin. I have the occasional period pimple, along with some skin sensitivity, but this evens out the base of my face without feeling cakey or gross. The finish is not quite matte but not dewy either, a nice middle. It feels lightweight on my skin, but i also dont use a ton of foundation either, just enough for what I prefer. Shocked at how much i like it. Oily skin can make it difficult to wear foundation, but this just works for me. * Looks natural, very easy to color match and blend, and no fragrance. 

The only negative is that the lid to the bottle is loose (the clear plastic, not the pump)."

A little disappointing for the price. * Lol i have no idea if im using this wrong or not! I set on top of the liquid foundation version of this or any other cream/liquid foundation I own. I've set with a sponge, a powder pouf, a brush and the cheap sponge it comess with but it doesn't actually set. I use a huge amount and set for a while too, but my skin still feels wet to the touch after i tried setting with this powder. I've tried different techniques and applicators but I can't seem to make it work. This makes me sad becuase it's on the pricy side. * I used this a few times last week and my face started breaking out with tiny whiteheads. Not purchasing it again! * Rob, the associate who helped me with my EL purchases, was patient as we tried various colors in EL products.  The Fresco turned out to be the perfect compliment to Ecru foundation.  Many have said they cannot tell I am wearing makeup * I love this product the Estée Lauder Powder Foundation. I use the color Fresco and will recommend to my friends. It stays on all day and you don't have to reply. I have been using this product for years. I just needed to make sure I buy the right color. * I have been telling everyone I know about this amazing product. Best powder I've ever used for everyday. I was getting tired of my liquid foundation on my jackets etc. This powder works on my melasma and my daughter just got it for under eyes. I plan on getting one for my mother for rosacea. * Great for fair skin.  Definitely something I'd recommend for good coverage and long lasting coverage."

I was really nervous purchasing this one (and not just for the price, although it's not inexpensive) because 1, there wasn't a single YouTube review about it (even from my favorite Dior-loving, Ulta -loving ones) and 2, I was matched with a very different shade than in my Backstage color (0.5 in Backstage, I was recommended 1.5 in this formula). Without any photos of anyone who looked much like me, I put my trust in the ""shade finder"" guide and bought it with some of my Ulta rewards points.  Now I'm going to have to cough up the $$$ when I need to replace it because it's my favorite foundation ever! It's got light-to-medium coverage that I want, it blurs my texture (fine lines, pores and wrinkles) while it moisturizes just enough and leaves a pretty, natural glow to my skin (not shimmer, certainly not glitter... just the glow of youth and vitality that tends to dim a bit with age). And one to one and a half pumps does my whole face (I don't have a petite face either lol) which makes me confident a bottle will last awhile. This foundation makes me feel good about how my 50+ skin looks and the shade match is chef's kiss perfection. I've stopped looking at any other foundation... this one is my new Holy Grail! * It's just enough coverage * LOVE.  See comments anove.  Worth the price.  A little goes a little goes a ling way. * Love this natural nude foundation.
it's a perfect coverage. I still love forever matte and the Glow Foundation but this one has a unique texture and quality that works very well on my skin.  I recommend it 100% thank you Dior. * I will start by saying this is a very nice, lightweight foundation. It has almost a water light feel on the skin and never has that mask-y feel (for someone with sensory issues this was a huge plus!). The color is a nice match and it does not oxidize at all. If you are looking for that ""glass skin"" effect, this will give it to you. The coverage is sheer to medium but I personally would not call this buildable  like the description says. 

Now the cons:

While I wanted to love this foundation, after a few wears it just left me underwhelmed. It still had a very nice skin like appearance but it didn't cover my acne or dark spots and did nothing to smooth my skin or blur pores. By hour 8 it had kind of settled and disappeared into my skin. Another bummer for me is the fact it has no SPF so I now have to find another product just to layer with it. Overall nice product but not for me * I just ordered and have worn it three times now and am hooked. It goes on beautifully, it has a smell but dissipates quickly. It does not oxidize like other high end foundations I have. I even got a massage and it lasted through my face on a massage table pillow. I can wear all day and not have to blot, I have an oily T-zone. It held up through hot and humid weather of the south eastern part of the country. * Overall this is a good foundation. It gives decent coverage and lasts well when properly set with powder. But, it's not good enough for the price tag. I have many more foundations that perform just as well or better for less money."

I have been trying to use of my older foundations but I keep on reaching for this bottle and I can't stop using it. I have combination skin so I break out on my cheeks usually and around my jaw line. On my nose and chin, my skin appears more dry. This has been one of the only foundations that does not overly show my fine lines or dry out my face. My skin looks glowy and healthy all day. It stays on my skin and applied best with a damp sponge. This foundation has truly changed my life. * Mac Studio radiance is a light foundation that has very good coverage, super recommended. the skin is left like silk. I love it * Based of other foundations I use, the recommended color was NC20, which ended up being too warm. I went into the store and the associate matched me to C4 which looks so beautiful on my skin! This is a buildable foundation that needs a damp beauty blender to smooth out the finish.  I highly recommend this—it gives me Luminous Silk vibes. * After second use, it made my face look flakes.  I put it on like I was shown in the store. * Very good material. * I thought this foundation would be thinner because it's a ""serum"" powered foundation. It is too thick for my taste. If you want a minimal coverage foundation, this is not it.  Otherwise, it is a good product. * I just started to use it and I love it. Really hydrating."

It Was a little cake for my liking…. Today is July 9. I'm returning it tomorrow when I get off of work. I Gave it a weeks try and nothing good for me. I bought it on June 25. * I live in a humid area and have combination skin. I have been using this foundation for many many years through all sorts of different occasions (work, concerts,  public events outdoors, etc) and this powder always sits well and looks natural. The only rime it shows up is when I have dry flaky skin around my nose, otherwise it looks great! I always make sure skin is well hydrated and use a primer. I also use a setting spray and either rehydrate with a facial mist when needed or blot skin with tissue when I get oily * I bought this to cover up the white cast from my physical spf when my ulta didn't carry the jcat aquasurance. I fell in the ocean when a wave tossed me, attended a foam party, and plan to attend dinner with the same face of makeup I've been wearing all day.

I really like the thin and serumy consistency because it's just so lightweight on the skin. * Literally the thinnest foundation I've ever tried. Suoer lightweight and didn't break me out. * I had high hopes for this foundation. This is too runny, would not stick on my skin and no coverage at all. Save your money for something else. * Well, i have to say that i am a huge pat mcgrath fan but this foundation for me oxidizes a bit and doesn't give me that airbrush look i hunt for.  Gonna stick with my too faced * Beautiful satin foundation!
Not too matte and not too dewy. 
It's very runny so all I need is one pump. It blends easily with a brush or sponge. It feels light weight and doesn't crease in my smile lines. I pair it with the Too Faced BTW concealer. Shade matching was easy, I wear shade M21 which is a perfect neutral. I recommend this foundation to anyone willing to splurge. * Over the past year and a half, I have been on the journey to find a foundation that doesnt transfer, is very longwearing, and doesnt settle into my smile lines. I have tried close to 20 foundations, and none come close to this one. It is the BEST foundation i have ever tried! Buildable coverage too. Ive never gotten more compliments on my skin! A forever repurchase. * I normally love Pat McGrath makeup, and find it to be worth the price. However, I can't say the same for the foundation. I've tried applying it with different brushes/sponges, with/without primers, and/or setting sprays. No matter what I do, it doesn't wear well on my skin. First off, it's quite runny. It applies patchy/streaky, so I feel like I realy have to work with it. Then, within a short amount of time it begins to settle into any lines and separate, especially around my nose. I definitely won't be purchasing this again."

Boy was I right! This lightweight tint is not only light, but powerful, when it comes to coverage. A must buy. I've already repurchased for the future! * Like most of the other people who were disappointed I really wanted to love this.

First try I wasn't thrilled with the coverage but blamed myself because after all it's a tint. Second try I wasn't sure about the color but again blamed myself. After it oxidized it wasn't bad but I didn't like the smell. Third try, I wanted to see if maybe I just needed a different shade, as this type of product would be great for an upcoming trip. But it pilled so badly I just can't. I was coming to terms with the oxidation and determined that the resulting color works, but it pilled to the point I nearly had to wash my face and started over. I made it work so I could get to work but the smell still bothered me and my eyes burned. I'm giving up on this one. It's not for me * It is not moisturizing it in fact turned into a matte and it seeped into my pores and lines. * Product marketing did not pair with performance - drying, caking/creasing and looked like foundation.

I have never exchanged or returned anything so I looked that up and apparently you have to go into the store. My local stores don't have my shade so I had to return the foundation, and I was asked to rebuy it. It doesn't make sense to return a product, wait to get the refund, and then repurchase it. This would be acceptable if refunds were immediate, but they are not. I have been an Ulta customer for years and this experience was very disappointing. * I read some reviews about  foundation cracking but also others that work good, I decided to try but quite disappointed I think this is not good at all x mature skins.

I normally wear Estee Lauder's Stay in Place foundation, which I've always relied on.

I chose this foundation in the shade 3, which has natural undertones. Oh my goodness was this the best decision ever. This has great coverage and lasts all day. Im from an area with high humidity and this stuff just does not budge, nor is it too drying. I have oily skin as well and I do not get any shine at all when paired with a silicone primer and CT Airbrush Powder. I have gotten sooooo many compliments since I began wearing this foundation. I highly recommend. * I am in love with this foundation. I am shade 8. I pair it with Glow Recipe moisturizer, Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer, Laura Mercier loose powder.  I am good for the whole day. Gorgeous finish! I am really oily btw. * M so happy I picked this foundation, it's hydrating 2 pumps give good coverage * This is such a great foundation. I do not enjoy the feeling of foundation and generally find few of them perform well and look flattering. For fair skin, this was a perfect match to my winter shade. I have never found a more accurate color. It is very matte but has a slight radiance to it. I have drier skin, so I have to do a lot of skin prep prior to applying (typically toner, Glow Recipe dew drops, moisturizer and primer) and I finish with the Hourglass Vanish setting powder. After that, it is long-wearing, oil-controlling (in T zone) and does not move. I only wish it were more dewy, but that is my only complaint about an otherwise flawless foundation."

It's extremely light weight, blends in quite easily, doesn't look weird over textured skin, lasts a good amount of time, and has a natural finish without looking too glowy. I would rate this a 4.5 if I could though, because I really dislike the packaging. The wrapper is really hard to remove and makes you peel of the label in order to be able to access the product, and the bottom of the product is bulbous, so it can barely stand up straight. It's not enough to make me stop using the product though, the formula really is incredible, I just would love the packaging to be updated a bit as it seems extremely cheap, even for a drugstore brand. * This product is perfect for those who are minimalists with their make up routine and want minimal coverage. It looks so nautral and evens out my skin tone while covering flaws. I really do love! * FINALLY…. A product that is super thin, lightweight, light coverage, AND works for my combo/oily skin! I will buy this forever! * I really didn't know how this would look on me, I usually use more silicone based foundation so... But this one was very nice. I did have to put it on the back of my hand and give a little mix first then apply it to my face. I tried pumping it directly on my skin and it didn't blend right.. This foundation is definitely not beginner friendly.  I'm sure everyone is different but this is the best method for me. Also I have dry, mature, skin. It wore nicely for about 4 hours. After that I needed a touch up. But it's definitely a nice light coverage!! * This stuff is the definition of ""your skin but better."" I've tried SO many tinted serums, wasted so much money on $40+ brands for them to be useless. I've found the easiest way to apply this is directly to your face, then blend with fingers, then blend out with a beauty blender. 

I have sensitive skin and rosacea, this is the first product I've ever used that didn't irritate or break out my skin. And weirdly, despite having pretty light coverage, this does an amazing job at covering my redness. Covering actually might not be the right word, it's more like toning almost. It doesn't look like I have anything on, yet still seems to almost eliminate my redness (which has always been severe). I have no clue how this works, I swear it's magic because  I cannot understand it. 

Coverage is somewhat buildable, but definitely meant to be used lightly. It'll get cakey if you set it with powder, and then if it gets wet it'll lift really weird, but I don't ever feel the need to use powder. Powder blush and brozer work fine over it, just not setting your whole face. I'll go all day just with this and not get oily at all, it doesn't slide off like other tinted serums, and when it does wear it looks really natural. A bit sticky at first but it will dry down, and feels like there's nothing on your face! Definitely is somewhat waterproof, by far the most oit of any other product like this I've tried. 

I've worn this to bed many times without any breakouts, and in the morning I truly can't tell whether there's any of it left on my face (in a good way), because my skin looks better after wearing this. Probably the bakuchiol, which is what prompted me to buy it bc I already use a serum with that every night that I love. 

And again, I don't have great skin to begin with, and I've gotten endless compliments on my skin since I started using this. People saying my rosacea looks better, pores, texture, etc. 

I don't bother with reviews much, but man, every time I use this stuff, every time I look in the mirror I can't stop thinking how good my skin looks, and how natural. * The first few times I used this I thought it looked beautiful on the skin when first applied. But noticed after being on my skin for a little bit my skin felt tight. I should have looked at the ingredients first. Benzyl Alcohol is pretty high on the list of ingredients. unfortunately, it makes my already dry skin drier. * I've used this a few times and have been loving it on my no makeup makeup days when I don't want a full coverage base. I get hormonal acne along my chin so it tends to leave acne scars, so this doesn't fully cover them up but it still gives a natural finish. 

It leaves my skin looking healthy, covers my spider veins, provides light coverage under my eyes in place of concealer, and gives me an all around healthy glow. 

I do 2 pumps and rub it between my hands first then spread evenly onto my face before using a brush to buff it out. I recommend this if you're starting out with makeup or if you prefer a natural finish."

Yet I find myself using this foundation more than any others in my possession. The color I have is a perfect match for my complexion. I will continue to purchase this Pretty Fresh foundation. * I have tried at least 5 foundations this year and this is still my favorite one. I love how liquidy the consistency is. 1 pump is enough. Blends super easily. Doesn't crease, look like a mask, accentuate texture or separate. Leaves a beautiful skin-like finish. Keeps my skin hydrated. If colourpop ever discontinous this foundation I would cry for real. * Super lightweight coverage * Showed my lines instantly. * Great price great ful coverage. Lasts all day.  A little goes a long away.  I have normal skin and I love it.. * I got shade fair N20 and it was way too light for me going on, looked in the mirror 3 mins later and it was too dark and very very orange. Disappointed, definitely not neutral. * Great product! I love this foundation it feels like your skin , great colors to match your skin!"

i personally prefer a dewy and natural look, and something that evens out my skin tone. i find that other makeup sits well on top of it, the only time ive seen it move around because of another product is when i tried to put the saie illuminator on top. if your preferences are like mine i think you will like this product !! * I don't know why this isn't sold in stores! It's absolutely fantastic! I don't normally like wearing liquid foundation because it feels heavy but this one is so light and actually does provide good coverage without the heaviness. I have plenty of acne scars and discoloration and it makes my skin appear almost flawless - basically solid coverage without feeling like full coverage heavy foundation. I don't even need to wear concealer under my eyes or elsewhere when I use this. I like to apply it by squeezing a few lines onto each area of my face directly from the tube and then work it in with a brush. I go back in with a dab of liquid bronzer to give my face dimension. If I have time I'll let it dry 5-10 min and set very lightly by pushing in some setting powder. It ends up with a nice dewy finish but if you go heavier on the setting powder you can get closer to matte if that's what you like. Lastly, I wear the ivory shade which works in combination with the bronzer but would otherwise be too pale (I'm a 2N1 in Estee Lauder powder in winter and 2N2 in summer). I just ordered the golden ivory in this product for summer but again, with bronzer the ivory still works for me all year. * I wanted to love this! It goes on very smoothly, which is great. But I wouldn't say it is buildable because it's so oily it never dries enough for a second coat—if you wanted. About 2pm I look so oily bc my powder has dissolved. I tried it about a month and kept wondering why my face was always shiny—and felt oily. I thought it was new moisturizer but it's not. It's this. If you have dry skin—this would be perfect! * I can't believe how great this product is at such a reasonable price point. My skin is very dry and  so most foundations were settling into my fine lines or emphasizing scaliness. This foundation does not do that and it is incredibly hydrating. I like natural coverage and this does that perfectly but I think it could be buildable, too. I find that it does transfer pretty easily but I think that's the trade-off for it being so moisturizing. I just a put a little powder to set it and that seems to help. * This product did not work for me. I am 43 with combination skin seeking a foundation with spf. It felt amd looked very shiny. I live in Florida and need something long wear and humidity proof. I am a fan of L'Oreal just not this one. * I dont like yhat everything had nucinimide its so irritating for mt skin :( * This product is just okay. Application is great, easy to blend and definitely buildable. I started with just one layer first with my fingers but it didn't blend well so went in with a brush. I may try again with a beauty blender because the brush wasn't bad but it was trying to cling to texture and dry patches. It wore well around my pores (not well in fine lines!!) until i tried to do a touch up. It just moved everything and removed the base completely. I would recommend embracing any texture or oil because you can't touch this foundation up dyrung the day."

I pair this with the hourglass vanish primer and the urban decay setting spray and it is *chefs kiss* * I have acne prone skin. I am extremely sensitive to bad ingredients & fragrance. I've used the sweetener foundation for a year now and can verify it doesn't break me out!! My skin is currently the best it's ever been because I use clean products and this is one of them. Thanks Ariana ily < 33 * This foundation formula is thick! I use so little and use my fingers to apply. Initially I went in with my normal amount and it looked cakey and heavy, so less is more! I have very oily skin and this lasted me for 10-11 hours and a concert. Highly recommend. * definitely one of my favorite foundations. i orginally bought this back in december for the first time but got the wrong shade (poor shade matching on my part) 
i completely forgot about it until recently so i went back and re-bought another shade (my correct one this time lol) and i absolutely love it!! so full coverage, weightless and wears so beautifully. you don't need a lot to cover your whole face, which i love. i pear this foundation up with the r.e.m. beauty primer and finish it off with the setting spray, such a great combo! r.e.m. beauty needs more recognition, ariana's complexion products truly are the best. * I really like how light weight and full coverage the foundation is * The shade could've matched batter, but overall, very good foundation. * This foundation is the best foundation I have ever used. The finish, the coverage, the texture and the longevity is unmatched. It's the perfect balance of somewhat dewy with long wear of a matte foundation."

This version has way better packaging and has more coverage so it's particularly good for work and event travel. But, oddly, it looks and feels drying on my (normal, slightly sensitive) skin. It highlights tiny fine lines I didn't know I had. The formula is not significantly different than the original, it just has more pigment, and the whole schtick is hyalauronic acid and hydration, so I don't know why it has this effect. It's noticeable, so I have to beef up my skincare accordingly in order to wear it and apply it while my moisturizer/SPF are still tacky. May not be suitable for folks with dry or textured skin, or folks who find these issues too fussy. * I love this foundation. It's light and feels nourishing. I was using a matte foundation (Chanel) for many years due to oily skin, but it started feeling kind of dry on my 60 y/o skin. My skin feels young again. And it glows. 
This one is a keeper! * Unlike any other foundation or concealer that I've tried.  Literally, this is magic.  Evens tone, covets flaws, smooths every textural flaw, diminishes pores, seems to moisturize any dry patches, and feels like I'm wearing no makeup.  It's absolute must-try for anyone over 50yo and doesn't love the typical look of foundation. Yes, I'm ordering a backup. * I tried the Water Fresh Tint when it first came out and didn't like it at all. There was absolutely no coverage. This though, is what i was hoping for with the tint. The Complexion Touch is so good. It's beautiful on the skin and has a light to light medium coverage, and it feels like nothing on the skin. Don't use the brush that comes with it to apply because its way too small, however I've found that its a really good concealer brush. My only gripe with this foundation is that you go through it pretty fast. Im already halfway through my second bottle and this stuff is pricey. But it's totally worth it. * Love it, it's moisturizing without getting too oily, wears light on the face and doesn't look cakey. Easy to throw in the purse. * Just not for me. It feels heavy and greasy. I couldn't stand it. * I have tried different bases and no matter what base I use, this pills awful! Rubs off as I'm applying. Have tried with a brush and using fingers. Try another Chanel product."

I love the full coverage but not feeling cakey on my face * It's pretty much the only shade that has matched since the discontinuation of previous foundations * Amazing. Stays all day & looks like skin. Best foundation I've ever used. * this foundation blends out EFFORTLESSLY. the coverage is amazing, a little goes a long way as its thicker coming out but feels weightless on the skin. i use shade 650 Alexandria for my light almost medium skin tone with a cool/neutral undertone. cool underone foundations tend to pull pinky on my skin so this shade is perfection! highly recommend, great price for great quality! * I reach for this when I need full coverage and long lasting- weddings, long work days, etc. It is pretty remarkable how good this is. However, as Ive been getting older, i do find i need to mix it with other foundations to keep it from settling into fine lines and wrinkles. It can easily make me look drier and more mature. I think its perfect for anyone with normal to oily who doesnt need to worry about aged skin at this time in their life."

I will use this up on my undereyes only. Also, wish the travel size bottles came in more shades. * Great feel * I really enjoy the soft and light touch this foundation has.  I've had others to wear it just felt caked on but not this one.  Mind you that I really don't need a full cover up foundation, this one really meets my needs. * I dont know why this isnt more talked about!! This looks so smooth on the skin, the finish of it isnt too glowy or too matte. It lasts a decent amount of time too and there was minimal lifting on my nose where my sunglasses were. * I received this product with a short expiration date, so returned it.  Also, not right color.  Didn't want to order again.  However, good cruelty-free product, so might work for someone else. * This goes on smooth, doesn't crease or cake, blends easily, and is just the perfect amount of coverage (not too much, not too little). It's a moderate amount of coverage, but seems buildable if you need more. So happy I gave this a try! * I love this, just turned 30 and skin is changing, dry combo skin, and have been trying new foundations the last couple years. Estee lauder hydra rescue foundation was my main go-to. I tried about face and liked it, but its heavy and transfers easily. Nars felt too orange and heavy and the bottle leaks. Ilia serum foundation is greasy and bare minimum coverage with a steange smell but feels good for my skin once it sinks in. Clinique even better serum foundation was also decent but this is is. Goes on smooth and easyoly sets with primer/powder. Good coverage. Feels light. I hope this sticks around for awhile. The shade match was wrong as most are for me as im fair with some freckles and rosacea so I recommend going 1-2 shades lighter, and then you can always blend it easier with bronzer/concealer to get perfect match."

I have been searching for a foundation like this for YEARSSS. (I have super sensitive combo skin leaning dry. Liquid foundations always look terrible on me after 1 hour. I do great skin prep too!) Lightweight, breathable foundation, quality ingredients, minimal ingredients, fragrance free, light to medium coverage, skin like finish, 6 to 8 hour wear still looking flawless, doesnt dry my skin out, doesnt irritate my skin, doesnt cling to dry patches, COLOR MATCH ON POINT, skincare ingredients, AFFORADABLE, anti-pollution (I live in SLC, worst air quality/pollution here) I  literally cried when i first put this foundation on i was so blown away at how perfect it was. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NEVER EVER discontinue or reformulate. I am a customer for life and this foundation has changed my life. * very skin like finish! no fuss foundation. * This is an undetectable foundation on my mature, dry skin, though it can build easily for extra coverage. I will just add additional drops on those darker spots, which still peek through but look more homogenous. But coverage is not my main concern, so this winner maintains the slightly dewy glow over a well -prepped skin base, still looking un made-up by the end of the day. Also, goes over mineral sunscreen flawlessly. IMO it is on par with Haus Labs, Nars Radiant LIght, MUF reboot; my other favs. I am trying another shade, though am happy with Katey, the match I found via the skin models- so that's my recommendation for finding your shade, rather than the description. It is on sale, so... TRY IT! * I'm assuming this foundation is on clearance because of quality issues… I received my order and the formula is completely separated and cannot be mixed back together to a good consistency. * I was so surprised when i first used it, my skin looked like skin. I like a lightweight natiral finish and this gives me exactly that! It also stays on all day/night, only thing is that it oxidizes a little bit but not wnything drastic. Has been my go-to foundation for over a year already! * good match for hard shade (fair/light olive) and good for sensitive/acne prone/scar/texture skin. decent coverage but feels light and natural. but doesnt really set (makeup smudges on my cat) & taking the top off pulls the entire pump out sometimes * I have used this foundation for a few years and it's never let me down. I fluctuate between a range of their lighter, cool toned shades depending on the time of year. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. A few things I've learned along the way: 

*A thin base layer will cover most spots and uneven tones. If you need more coverage, then spot treat with a little more foundation.
*It pairs beautifully on top of Nudestix tinted sunscreen.
*Applies well with brushes or sponges, but better with your fingers.
*A stippling, dabbing motion is the best method to apply the thin layers.

I'm 41, and I receive many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation, and I feel like I look more youthful with this on. I will definitely continue to repurchase!"

It looks good for 2 hours then starts fo separate. I have oily and textured skin, it has broken me out. I think itll be good for a little while only. * This was my first time trying bare minerals foundation, and I am genuinely surprised by how bad it is.  It settles right into every fine like and wrinkle within minutes and makes them look much bigger and more prominent than they are.  It's very thin and greasy, and it doesn't stay put for even a couple hours. I wore it to a meeting and I was horrified afterwards when I saw that my foundation was visibly smudged and smeared by my sunglasses on my short commute to work.  For reference I wore it over bare minerals primer and under another setting spray that normally works well; skin was well-moisturized before application and I used a blender sponge to apply.  I'm 41 and I've been wearing drugstore foundations for most of my life.  I have tried many over the decades but this might be the worst foundation I have ever tried.  Very overpriced for extremely low quality. * I really love the coverage. It is smooth, light and moisturizing with out feeling oiling. * You changed the colors of Bare Minerals liquid foundation. I wear Sandstone 16. The color that supposedly you changed the name to medium 30 warm. Is way not the match. I'm taking this back. Who advised you that it would make the consumer happy. Now I have to look for a cheap one till I can match it with a different company. Yuk! * I absolutely hate the new formula. Exchanged it 3 times, still can't find a match. New formula is oily. I can see lines I didn't know I had within hours. Does not set. Leaves my face looking extremely shiny & oily. I need the old formula & my old color back. * I love BM products, but this one was a no for me. I'm in my mid-40's and my skin, which used to be combination to oily and prone to acne, changed to normal to dry. So, I changed my beauty routine and make-up products to adjust. I read great reviews about this one so I gave it a chance but no matter how I applied it, it will become patchy after an hour and completely peeling after that. I tried to use my fingers (by warming it up), a brush, a sponge, with and without primer and it never worked. It might work for some but not for me... * Completely terrible, very oily. I applied foundation this morning and it looked like I would have lathered baby oil on my face. I tried to shake it thinking it was separated but it sounds like water."

As a mixed white asian it's been hard for me to get correct undertones my whole life and this is by far the most invisible color match. Before date night, i stopped using foundation completely because my skin was so sensitive. I say this foundation is best for the summer because during the winter it does bring our dry patches in your skin and can become patchy. Even when used with the primer and setting spray the patchyness cannot be fixed when you have dry skin. Definately use an occlusive moisturizer under this foundation for best textural results! I would love if youthforia came out with a concealor and also fixed their range issues before they disappear. I would hate to lose this foundation!!! * Youthforia's Date Night Skin Tint Serum Foundation is a lightweight, serum-like foundation that offers a sheer to light coverage, perfect for achieving a natural, dewy look. It's packed with skin-loving ingredients like plant-based oils, which nourish and hydrate the skin while giving a radiant glow. The formula feels weightless, blends effortlessly, and is designed to adapt to your skin's tone. It's ideal for those seeking a no-makeup makeup look or light coverage that enhances their skin. * The foundation is a the perfect shade for me. The shade and coverage is also buildable and I love how lightweight it feels on my skin. In addition, it's great to travel with and the packaging is super easy to use. A little foundation goes a long way. * I have sensitive skin so finding a suitable foundation is really hard!

It is very light coverage but buildable. It's glowy but not oily/greasy. I will say if you have acne, dark marks, etc. it might not cover the way you want the first time but I find this the perfect work / daytime product. It matches my skin tone PERFECTLY. From drugstore it's a bit pricey but I will 100% repurchase. * Good coverage, great shade match and lots of product! My only thing is that it does fade as I wear it, but I do touch my face sometimes. Will buy again. * I've never really tried Revolution Beauty makeup but when this went a little viral I figured why not since it was so cheap! But I was very impressed. I have dry-combo skin and am pale with freckles. The color options worked for me as I am on the more neutral side. The finish was pretty.

For reference: I'm 41 with combination skin. 

I tried this on in-store. Wasn't in love with it, but Pür changed their tinted moisturizer's colors and they no longer looked good on my skin.

This tint has almost no coverage. It is watery and streaks. Be careful because it will just run out of the tube. It also clings to my dry spots (mostly my chin and around the nose).  I definitely moisturize before I put it on. I've tried it with a brush. I've tried it with a sponge. I've tried it with my fingertips. But it's all the same. It just looks horrible and I could not recommend this. * Super greasy and streaky whether you use a brush or sponge. I understand its a skin tint but has zero coverage. Separating on my nose and chin and will cling on to dry spots. 0/10 recommend * Left a rash after being on my skin for 2 minutes. The burning started and I washed it off immediately, and this is what I was left with. There is virtually no coverage. Buy a tinted sunscreen, or a better skin tint like the one from Ilia. * Should have taken the reviews seriously… If I had kept the box it would be returned…. It is a watery mess… There is a chemical odor… And the color is off…probably due to the consistency… I used the previous version of this product for years…and am extremely disappointed with this ""new and improved"" version of the product…. Nothing stays the same… What was wrong with old Tinted Moisturizer that it needed to be changed…watered down…? This was a total waste of money… this tinted moisturizer will go down drain where it belongs…! (Don't set the tube in the upright position on the cap…it will be a mess when opened…) * At first glance this seemed promising but about only and hour the product caked and separated on my skin, this isnt the worst part. It gave me a severe reaction, im now walking around with a painful rash on my face. I will be returning this. * Just a skin tint, has lots of fragrance in it. * I love this for a ""no makeup"" glow. I waited 20 min after my skin care and applied using my fingers. I was so happy it went on flawlessly and blended so nicely. Truly looks like my skin but better. It feels hydrating and lightweight, and lasted all day without creasing. Love it!"

So affordable and a great product. This is the best packaging in my personal collection. Feels luxurious. * Ive been using this for a couple weeks since i got it and so far its been a really nice powder foundation. I previously used the old ulta powder foundation in the gray packaging but they since reformulated and im unsure how a lack of talc will look after the horror that was the essence 16hr powder.

Its lightweight, doesnt settle, i was able to find a workable shade but i may need a winter shade. I like that the back has holes for the breathability and i also like the square component as it gives u a more precise sponge and larger mirror however, the way you lift up to get the sponge is a little annoying. I find that it last pretty long however its hard to tell how much as its already not the most coverage. Im a male and find this dosnt work well over trimmed/shaved hair, it kinda builds up weird and looks spotty other powders typically don't althought maybe im putting too much on, its not terrible i can work around it. Overall i would reccomend this powder! 4/5 * Worked perfectly on my skin all summer, didn't even need to prime. * This product is so fine and pwdery, the fallout is CRAZY, and there is, in my opinion, zero coverage. I love Juvia's Place products but this was a flop. I have the ELF powder foundation which is half the price and has quadruple the coverage. Love other products but this is a total no. * I used the color match on ulta and it definitely linked me to the correct shade. I love this product and it's a great price as well as high quality. Juvia's Place never misses. ❤️ * The worst powder foundation I've ever used. The fallout on it is ridiculous, and coverage is mediocre. I've had it a few weeks and hit pan already. * This by far is the best, I use Tanzania. It's totally worth the price. Before I used other cheaper products and by mid day my makeup was gone, even with setting spray. But this product not only last all day. But I have an amazing glow, a natural glow."

I have been a fan of Black Opal for a Long Time. I love the coverage for my skin and you can mix if the color does not match at a great price! * I bought this foundation being of all the good reviews. Unfortunately the moment i put it on my skin the color was immediately to warm for my complexion, i got the heavenly honey. It looked WAY to orange and when i washed it off it looked like pure orange on my skin. It showed every ounce of texture on my skin (i dont have much texture) and sunk into every pore. Would not recommend at all. * Wanted a stick foundation for a light everyday makeup look. This is perfect! I use about 3 swipes on both sides of my face to even out my complexion. Blends best with a damp sponge followed by a foundation brush. Also love the neutral undertones!! * Love using this have been doing this now for 5 years. Have not been disappointed. * I finally found a stick foundation that matches my skin so well.  I put it directly on my skin after moisturizing and pat it in with a make up sponge.   Using a press shine eliminator my be helpful for oiler skin.  I love this foundation and I will be purchasing it again. * I came in hoping to get what I usually used but my shade was not in stock.

I am not sure why others are saying it transfers, non issue so far.  Pump takes a bit to get the product up and out at first, store it cap down. * It transfers like crazy! No matter how I set it, it would still transfer; with that being said therefore it doesnt last. I put in the morning for work and it looks great but throughout the day it looks like I dont even have makeup on. * beautiful formula! evens out skin with just one pump, blurs but still gives such a skin like glow. ive tried it with multiple primers or just skincare and it still last me all day! the pump gets stuck sometimes but thats not a huge inconvenience for me! applies seemlessly with brush or sponge! * Spot on color, not too thick, buildable and dry-skin friendly. It's my new go to foundation and I'm glad I tried it. * Omg i was sure i was gonna like this foundation when i got it cause i heard it was like a nars duoe but i FELL in love with it. Its so beautiful and doesnt oxidize yellow/orange like Nars. I wanted to test it out so i didnt set it or use setting or fixing spray and GIRL DID IT LAST!

I only use it when I'm alone, testing makeup. It is very visible, specially on the side of my nose where it gathers up and looks clumsy/cake/powdery. Looks patchy on my forehead and chin with the applicator, a fluffy brush is needed to blend it out. 3 stars for the cute compact and mirror! * it made me so pale and it had a nasty smell to it * I did NOT like this powder foundation at all! It is very talcum like, and sits on top of the skin. It looks very powdery! I've never used a powder foundation that did that. I know it is an inexpensive product, but it's truly awful. Don't recommend. * Without looking like there is powder caked on, it is very natural. Leaves smooth finish. Lasts all day (I work 10 hours a day outside and have no issues) * A total dupe for the L'Oreal powder foundation, with better pigment, and for 1/4 the price. Yes, it's gonna look powdery and cakey if you try to use it on it's own. But it makes a great setting powder if you're looking for extra coverage. It lasts really well on it's own, but I keep an extra in my purse for touchups after a long day if I'm going out. If you find it a little too matte I would suggest a non-matte finishing spray, it gives it a more natural look. Another hit from Essence! * I went from liquid foundation to this about 5 years ago. I'm glad I made the change. I feel as is I don't have anything on my face. If needed, it is buildable. Liquids were feeling too heavy, especially in summer. * I like the finish of the powder, on my face! I used my foundation and then this powder and loved it!"

I was concerned about this product bc I normal stick to liquid foundation. I have tried almost every one out there but I was extremely surprised by this foundation! It was easily buildiable with smooth application. I was concerned at 1st the color match was a bit darker (245 warm beige) but after concealer & some pressed powder I had the most beautiful sun-kissed glow! For reference I love Nars in Santa-fe, Clinique  CN 40 cream chamois, Colourpop light 55N. I don't really see any skin type having an issue with this product. It was easy to apply, didn't feel heavy or cakey, never felt oily or dry, just smooth & silky. Highly recommend. No issues using other brand products with this foundation. I saw some saying it moves along or was patchy, follow the directions & build it. This is a cream to powder product so it will apply a bit different.  Will repurchase * LOVE LOVE THIS BLUSH * I was looking for a quick and easy compact makeup and ended up buying this instead of MAC's Full Coverage Foundation since the possible shades that could match me were sold out, and boy am I glad they were! I still haven't gotten to trying the MAC one, but this Milani foundation is incredible and is a lot better than I expected! It's medium to full coverage, looks super natural but flawless on the skin, and is actually less greasy/shiny than most of my liquid foundations which us surprising for a cream. It does set to a satin, powdery finish, and wears beautifully with a touch of powder on top if you have more oily skin like I do. Also, the shades Warm Beige and Sand Beige have really nice neutral-yellow undertones that can match many medium complexions very well! Definitely happy I found my new favorite, easy to apply foundation! This is a lot less messy and quick to apply than liquid foundations, which I love! A brush or a sponge will work equally as great with this stuff and look flawless :) Definitely recommend it! Thanks, Milani!! < 3 * This is very inexpensive and lasts longer than Estee Lauder all day foundation. I didn't have a bald spot on my nose like Estee Lauder at the end of the day. The shineyness at the end of the day was minimal and I have oily T-zone, combo skin. It didn't crease in my fine lines or accentuate my pores. Mac and Estee Lauder powder foundations both did this and were oily right away. I used Laura Mercier primer and Urban Decay setting spray. I use a beauty blender sponge to apply. Milani worked better than more expensive brands. Just try it! Use finishing powder to set before spraying your face. * this is the first powder foundation i have tried and im never going back to liquid foundation. * After hearibg all the amazing things about this foundation I wanted to love it. I've had such a hard time trying to grab enough product to evenly blend out. I've used my fingers, foundation brush, flat foundation brush, beauty blender, etc. now it just feels like the foundation is dried out and pretty useless at this point."

I love the coverage of this product and how comfortable it feels in my skin. A little goes a long way so I don't burn through the product either. * I got this in the color fair. It has great coverage for my acne and redness, it also does a great job moisturizing my dry skin (even in the winter!). The SPF is a very welcome bonus a well! There is little to no scent that could be perceived as offensive (and I'm very sensitive to scents). Definitely a safe repurchase. * I enjoyed using this tinted moisturizer for sure. The color match is amazing and I like the medium buildable coverage. It lasts all night. Definitely like that it has SPF 25 built into it for sun protection. Also feeling that it's hyaluronic acid powered along with other ingredients that are good for the skin. It also gives a certain glow to the skin. I recommend this so much that I already bought backups for when I finish this! * The coverage was so good and very quick application. I like that the scent doesn't linger because I'm very sensitive to smells. I really like the packaging and ingredients. Nothing that irritates my skin. Overall I will be adding this to my daily products * Oxidizes to be very orange, and the medium shade was already very warm toned. The consistency feels like a serum, which at least does not look cakey. There is no scent. Not sure if I will apply heavy enough to get any sun protection. * A little bit goes a long way with this, pretty close to full coverage. It definitely has a very dewy/shiny finish and is sort of sticky so its not my favorite consistency. * This is a great tinted moisturizer! The coverage is perfect, it goes on smoothly and blends in well. It looks like I'm wearing foundation but I'm not! The color matched well, also. I recommend it!

But the downside: The container is glass so its heavy & only half full when purchased. Sometimes you get one with a defective pump...it doesn't come up when using then when it does its squirts product all over making a mess. * I absolutely loved the conceal foundation so I thought I'd try this one,  although it's a nice foundation the pump doesn't work! I exchanged it and the same thing happened * This foundation is absolutely incredible on my oily, acne prone skin. It has never broken me out and lasts the entire day. I use this with the nyx plump right back primer and my makeup does not move at all. Even in 100+ degree weather, this foundation does not sweat off or become patchy. I have gone through about 6 or 7 bottles of this and my only negative thing to say about it is the pump hardly works on every bottle i've had, but the product itself is so good that it doesn't bother me. Better than any other foundation i've ever tried, even high end. * Cool toned/neutral pale/fair skin. Great formula, repurchased multiple times. * Okay but it leaks bad. * Very cakey but amazing coverage * It's a smeary mess after 2 hours. I wanted to like this. The color matched my skin, no matter how I prime it or what powder I use, it just looks bad on the skin after an hour or two. It looks smeary and doesn't blend well, sits on top of the skin.

Which is crazy, everything makes me breakout but this stiff is the best! * I do not have oily skin but this foundation sure will make you look like you slathered butter on your face. Coverage is not very good either. It's very thin and extremely oily. Usually I do like their other products but this is definitely not it. I have tried it both with primer and without. Neither way lasted all day as it just essentially slid off. * the coverage on this is amazing you can wear on it's own and leaves a beautiful glow but if you have oily skin like me i don't recommend, you'll look a mess lol * I had extremely high hopes for this product. I read all the reviews watched the YouTube videos and was ready to go.  First I tried the shade Punta Cana (5) and it was too dark. Then I went back and got the shady Giza (6) and it was too late, so I decided to mix both of them together, hoping it would balance out. I don't understand how a product can have so much pigment but no coverage if that makes sense.  The product is highly pigmented and when you put it on, you can clearly see there's makeup on your face however, I have a few blemishesthat it provided coverage 0 coverage for.  It didn't matter how much product I went back and dabbed on the blemishes still no coverage. I even let it sit and dry down hoping that would thicken it up but still no coverage.  Also, it was not glowing or dewy for me. I looked straight up Greasy, even with just the first layer, I looked sweaty like I had been out in the sun. It was not a flattering look. I even tried powdering it down, but it just looked greasy with powder on top which basically turned cakey and even with all that I could still see my blemishes through.  I purchased this this evening and I will be returning it immediately when the store opens tomorrow.  I love Juvia's Places' products and I will still continue to support and purchase, but this just didn't work for me.  Buyer beware. * I tried this thanks to a friend who has it and gave me a 'sample' (thank you, girlfriend!).  I must say, yes, it's better than the ones by e.l.f. and Charlotte Tilbury.  You can use it alone for a subtle glow and coverage, or mixed with your foundation (for the same effect).  Looks great either way.  I'm planning on getting a bottle for myself.  I do recommend it. * Elf Halo Glow broke me out and I never was able to try the Flawless Filter by CT but I dont think I need to because I discovered this and I LOVEEEE it. Perfect under foundation or just by itself. Gives me a perfect glow without making me look greasy * I bought this to try out since I couldnt justify spending $$ on charlotte tilbury.

If you're an oilslick like me… this is a total waste. Maybe good for dryer skin? Going back to Dior at this price point and won't be purchasing this one again. * This foundation brought out texture and wrinkles I have never seen before. It is not very blend-able, as it takes a lot of manipulation to look somewhat acceptable. This product is very drying and I have oily skin. Not to mention it does not adhere to the skin, it slips and sides off your face throughout the day leaving you patchy. * I finally found my holy grail foundation, I didn't even buy it at Ulta but that's how much I loved it to write a review. It feels like I'm wearing nothing, it matches my skin perfectly which has been a nightmare for years trying to find a good match. * This coverage is a lot more sheer and dewy than I had anticipated. This would be a beautiful foundation for someone with dry, mature skin since it does not crease. The colors are not accurate either. I suggest ordering one to two shades darker. * I need to keep looking. I have a full bottle that I hope to find someone that it works for. * I was so disappointed in this product because I had been saving to buy it for such a long time and when I used it, it melted off and had to use a lot of setting powder to keep it in place somewhat!!

My 55 yr old skin looks great with it! I recommend using a primer and a brush for application. A little of it goes a long way. I hope Loreal never discontines this foundation! Try it! You wont be disappointed! * I am 61 and was so shocked when I began to apply this foundation/balm. It feels so nourishing and applies so evenly. It's light yet gives a good medium coverage. A great summertime weight. Not heavy but yet just enough color. Love it. Buy it. Give it a try. I think you'll like it. * This foundation is so perfect for me. It blends perfectly into my skin. It's so easy to apply. I just dab it on with a beauty sponge and I'm done in minutes! 
I love it ❤️ * I'm not sure why my skin reacts to foundation so terribly, but even the luxury brands make me look a little off. I know my undertone and have been able to pinpoint my exact color profile, so it's not that. Foundation usually sits on top of my face, amplifies my fine lines, and makes me look like a hot mess. Age Perfect Tinted Balm is the only foundation that makes me look better, and I wish I knew about it sooner. It's my favorite! * I have what the skincare industry refers to as ""mature ""skin. I am a make junkie and I had many foundations from drugstores and major department stores but as I got older they all made me look cake and settled into lines. I stumbled on this product and I love it. It's my skin only better. It lasts almost all day on my  combination oily dry skin. It is a wonderful product with light medium coverage for mature skin. Will definitely buy again * I've used 3 pots of this now and I'm still somehow surprised by how nice it is. The formula feels like it won't cover much, but it softens the appearance of/seems to fill and even out pores, scars, wrinkles, or any textures--I often get compliments on how smooth my skin looks when I use this. I've gone back and forth between two colors because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the color match is a little difficult. All in all, I keep trying new foundations just to come back to this one and be impressed by it. * I'm a light-medium skin tone that leans towards cool. I got started on this because an influencer raved about it a few yrs. ago. I decided to try it and couldn't had been more thrilled. I use shade fair 20 for reference. In the pot it looks more like a peach shade. It glides on effortlessly and melts into my skin. My dry/mature skin looks healthy. I'm sure I will get tired of this foundation, but for the last 3 yrs. I've been pleased. Only time will tell."

I hope they'll carry the newer HG skin tint so I can try that one. * Im 55 and my skin is very dry, this product is moisturizing and never settles in my pores , an excellent alternative to foundation which just sat on my skin, this tinted moisturizer does not do that. I would highly recommend this product- * I have never had so many compliments about my skin since using this tinted moisturizer! It may not be for anyone needing full coverage makeup but someone looking for a glow and slight coverage! * It was very hard to find something for my aging skin that is full coverage, but doesn't settle into lines and look caked on. this was recommended in store and I absolutely love it! I apply with a beauty blender and use shape tape concealer with a tiny bit of setting powder. Really makes a difference being hyaluronic and any pictures while wearing come out great. A must in my drawer. * I wanted to like this. I have dry skin and some creepiness at 52. This made all of that worse.

It's very thick and kinda hard to blend out even with moisturizer and primer. 
I had to return this and buy the Too Faced brand hydrating liquid foundation. * Several comments said this was medium to full coverage which made me want to try it and it is not. There is absolutely no coverage at all. If anything it's just a glorified moisturizer so I'm thinking those other comments were for a different product. * Absolutely one of my favorite foundation. I love how it leaves my skin glowing and hydrated!"

Also great for touch-ups when mineral foundation SPF is needed out in the sun! The closing latch wasn't super secure but I never had a problem with it opening in my purse. The new design is thick and super heavy. It's beautiful to sit on a counter, but useless weight for travel or carried in a shoulder bag. So sad I never odered backs up of the slim gold-tone compact! * I was surprised how expensive this compact is. But I have had so many contacts break and then I get crumbled pressed powder. This one looks like it will hold up well. I will let you know the first time I drop it-Yikes! * Very happy with this new compact. My JI mineral foundation stores securely,  the compact opens easily and now has a mirror. Yay! * I am a loyal Jane Iredale brand user. In fact, I have been using their products for over 20 years. The Jane Iredale line was recommended to me by the surgeon who did facial reconstruction after skin cancer surgery. 

Although I love their products, I have always been ""ehh"" about their packaging....until now! Thanks for finally giving up the gaudy gold (sorry, Jane Iredale) and going with this new, modern and aesthetically pleasing line of packaging. Since I have several of the old gold compacts, including the gold metals ones, I ordered one of the new compacts to see how I would like it. After receiving the new compact, I cannot wait to replace ALL my older versions! 

One more suggestion... in your future development, please consider making your eye shadows available in refills. I love the idea of being kinder to our planet and saving on the excess packaging. I do not mind paying separately for the cases if I know if is making a smaller, greener impact for future generations. =)

One final note of thanks to Ulta...I have been begging my local store to start carrying Jane Iredale. I am glad to see that you are at least finally carrying this amazing, clean line of makeup online! * I bought this on sale and I'm glad I did. It just makes it nice to put your foundation in. For the price of the foundation, it's a shame you have to purchase compact separately. * This packaging is overpriced and by default should be included with the powder. Waste of money."

I buy this again & again & pair it with concealer for under eyes / blemishes , & blush. Its so smooth, never breaks out my acne prone skin. I love it so much!! * Honestly I hate foundation, I have super sensitive skin and anything can break me out easily. This foundation is SO NICE!! It is more like a skin tint than a foundation, which I prefer if I do ever wear it, the smell is relaxing (if you're not an essential oil person I wouldn't recommend, the lavender is pretty strong), and it doesn't feel like anything is on. For my Florida girls this stuff is a great quick fix for the hot and humid days!! * I have super sensitive, rosacea-prone skin & my eyes are really easily irritated by makeup (ocular rosace) that started a few years ago - suddenly I couldn't wear my favorite makeup without breaking out, & my eyes burning, bright red. I searched & finally found a brand specifically for rosacea-prone skin! So happy to be able to wear makeup again! Over the last year or so the formula clearly changed - I couldn't find a color match & then my eyes started to  burn again. Back to the search - finally found this - I love this foundation & the whole product line! It's light & looks great - as others have said, I look like myself, only better! It doesn't settle in my lines or pores, doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It does feel a bit oily / has a bit of shine. Also, Nude 3 is a perfect color match for me when it goes on, but it does darken a bit across the day so I'm going to try 2.5 & save 3 for the summer. Otherwise, highly recommend!! * I bought this foundation and love it.  I'm 47 years old with dry and pigmented skin from aging and I like light coverage products due to aging skin look more natural than full coverage foundation.  Very moisturizing.  I still set with loose powder and yes would buy this as long as nudestix still made this. * I got this product in shades light3 it a good tinted moisturizer with light to medium at most.  Great for dry skin.  Love this product. * Flawless and lightweight. I'm in love. * im telling you right now GET THIS. the PERFECT natural foundation that isnt too sheer or too high coverage. also the single foundation i have that is my true shade!!!! i can blend this out so well even w my hands which i cant typically w other foundations and it blends out BEAUTIFULLY. funny thing is i bought this on mistake,, was trying out concealer and wanted to buy it but accidentally picked this up instead.

I've tried every popular brand in the world (under $50) and just couldnt find a product my skin liked until this one. 

I have both very oily and very dry skin and zero skin care routine so a lot of that is likely due to me being a bit terrible. But I was randomly recommended this over a year ago by a guy at the mall of America morphe store and it genuinely felt like second skin. He paired it with morphe primer and it's the best my skin ever has or will look. It looks so natural and yet makes my skin look amazing. You can't even tell I'm wearing foundation. 

I sadly ran out and tossed the bottle before ordering more like an idiot and I've spent the last 5 months trying to track this foundation down. I just ordered more so unless the formula has changed drastically I'll add pictures once I have it. But I was genuinely mourning the loss of this foundation and thought I was doomed to have cakey looking skin again forever. 

If you can't find a foundation no matter how many you try I highly highly recommend this one. Maybe my skin is just weird so it might not work for you but I will never ever allow myself to run out of this foundation again. It's been a terrible few months for my makeup without it. * I really love this foundation. I used to use MAC and like this much better after trying a bunch of different brands. I have very sensitive skin and no problems. I have been using this for years now and I am very happy with it. It goes on smooth and it buildable to a good medium coverage. * This was my first time trying this make up brand and I a now a fan! Makeup is lightweight and comfortable to the skin. Is  100% true to skin match and buildable coverage, and also holds well in heat! * Run run RUN to get this foundation!!! I cant say enough good things about it! It gives such a radiant, skin like finish and doesnt feel heavy or greasy. Plus, the shades come in differnt formulas, depending on the shade range!!! * This is my 4th time buying this foundation and they changed the formula! It has a watery, runny consistency, whereas before it was a thicker consistency. The new formula still works just as well as the old one! Coverage is buildable without looking cakey (just make sure to blend with a damp sponge). I have rosacea and red acne marks & it covers flawlessly and still looks like my skin. 

I also have combo skin. I find this foundation to hydrate and also not accentuate my oils that i produce throughout the day. It's a perfect soft matte finish. * I get compliments whenever I wear this. it's a really good, light on the skin, natural finish foundation, but somehow still manages to have good coverage. It's very easy to blend into the skin, and wears great across the day. My absolute favorite thing about it though is that it has the best shade range and undertone range I've experienced. I'm a pale olive which is very hard to find foundation for, but this looks amazing on me. * This foundation of the game changer, so long wearing I work 10 to 12 hour days and it does not budge crack or flake. This is a Serum foundation so it is very watery but the coverage is absolutely amazing. I have never seen a Foundation blur the way this does. I have been mixing this foundation with the Youthforia primer for light days this combo makes it into a radiant tinted moisturizer."

I use a light shade which I chose by pretty much matching my neck/highlight areas and use it mainly in my T zone. highlighting under eyes, forehead between brows chin and then I also add it along my jawline. then I go about my routine as normal but without the need for foundation highlight and baking. saves so much time! it builds well and has amazing coverage. it lasts all day. I have mature skin and hate when things settle into fine lines and wrinkles and I do not have that problem with this. it actually makes my skin appear younger compared to my full face routine with baking etc. I know I hav to find a new foundation to help avoid it but who has the time lol anyway... YES. this product is one I want to hoard in case it ever goes away. it's amazing. I use it with a compact dense brush. 

only downside is that I broke 2... but it's because I throw it in my purse and I know that's not ideal and on me for being careless. but if it's getting tossed around, be aware the powder may break. * This is a must have in my kit! I use it to lightly set my foundation and it transforms my face! I have also used it as a powder foundation for summer days and it is flawless! * This is the best powder foundation i have ever tried, i reach for this one over my high end one. Its my go to during the summer months. * Medium to full coverage. I like to carry it in my bag for touch ups because it covers the redness around the nose, i can cover up some my blemishes that peak out after wearing makeup all day etc * I use the shade Natural and I absolutely love this powder. i've used mine all the way to the pan and just restocked a new one. Literally the most beautiful blurring coverage, doesn't feel cakey or drying and my skin looks flawless. Great for on the go and quick touch ups. I usually hate the feeling of wearing heavy foundations and powders so once I found this it was over. Super breathable and comfortable and evens out my skin tone in a couple quick pass overs. I love this product. * Medium to high coverage, smoothing, non-comedogenic. Its a bit hard to shade match. I use Soft Tan in this powder and Nars Valencia, Lisa Eldridge 19, Estee Lauder 4w1. * This was my favorite foundation for everyday wear until recently. It is the best color match I've found and so easy to use. However, as others have stated, my last two orders have fallen apart into unusable powder within a few uses. Super bummed."

It does not settle in my lines; it actually plumps my skin (hyaluronic acid 🙌🏻🩵👏🏻🤩) and gives a flawless finish. I also have extremely sensitive skin and my face does not react to this at all. It seems a lot of brands are now incorporating good skincare ingredients in foundations and this one is a winner! 🥇🙌🏻👏🏻 * Went tried on my arm but ,when I put on face was way to dark for it.
But this is my first time ever using anything on my face so I'm  learning baby steps. * I'm over 50, have fair, neutral, combination skin with especially dry cheeks, redness, and texture. This foundation seemed to cover the redness fine but it faded within about 2 hours of wear. It settled in my fine lines and looked, for lack of a better word, gritty. No fragrance but does have an unpleasant chemical smell. It's a no for me. (Not Revlon's fault but the color-finding function led me to 117 Light Beige, which was the right depth level but pulled warm on me.) * the most skinlike finish of any drugstore product I've ever found. it has good coverage, wears comfortably on the skin, and doesn't crease or transfer if you set and prep correctly. it feels like the $50-$70 foundations i used to wear and the price is unbeatable. 10/10 * What an incredible skin loving foundation. After 2 weeks of using I'm noticing a more even skin tone, my fine lines are disappearing, and my skin feels nourished. I love this for spring/ summer! I prefer it without primer as I notice I get the most benefit that way. I do set with a non-talc powder and Milani setting spray. It truly looks like skin if you get the right shade! * When set properly, this foundation lasts all day, looks like skin, and never cakes or clings to dry patches. It looks and feels expensive on the skin, and I'd pick this over my Lancome for coverage anyway. It can be a bit too dewy if you don't do proper skin prep, but with the right primer and setting powder, it's perfect 👌 * This is an AMAZING foundation. The coverage is perfection. It's dewy, has great ingredients, and I absolutely love it on my very sensitive skin. I have been using this since it was introduced to the Revlon line and my hope is that this will never discontinue. 🤞 I have used only high-end foundations in the past before trying this foundation and this one is a clear winner. 🙌🏻🩷😻"

Im plesently suprised on how well this works with my skin chemistry. The coverage is very much buildable, some days i put just a tiny bit on to moisturize and even out my skin-tone, othertimes i build it up for more coverage. Only downside is the occasional pilling that others here mentioned, but its subtle enough. * I love this.  I apply after i ise a moisturizer.  Provides supermligbt coverage to even out skin tone. I use the shade 15 which has a yellow indertone rather than red. * It has great ingredients but it jusy peels right off the face. It doesnt stick at all it immediatly pills its unwearable which sucks cuz i love the ingredients * i love this skin tint. i've repurchased already and plan to again (and again!). it's nice and lightweight. does nit upset my dry/acne-prone skin at all. it evens the complexion nicely. i don't find it difficult to apply at all - i use a damp sponge. very happy with this. * Honestly super oily. It's very sheer which is nice but it really oxidizes in the skin so badly and clogs your pores. * Wanted to give this a try, one of the girls in the store recommended it for me saying its a great product. I tried it it was horrible, barely any coverage, dried very weird, and when i touched or wiped my hand over my face it was like pieces of it were coming off. I didnt even put alot on. Disappointed and would not recommend. * I have been on the hunt for a tinted moisturizer. Saw this tinted serum & based on the reviews wanted to try it out. Came in today and it was such a let down! Super watery and hss no coverage at all. I tried applying it with a beuty blender did not work, a brush was worse, ended up apllying it with my hands like i would a serum but its super patchy and hard to blend. Just a no jn my opinion, save your money snd try the purlesse tinted moisturizer with spf instead. Inwas trying to love this product in reolacement of my purlesse thats now $40, since this is more affordable but you def get what you pay for."

I love this Serum Tint!!! Medium coverage with a soft glow effect to your complexion. Easy to apply with a good foundation brush or finger tips. I do use a primer but not really necessary. Big bang for your bucks.  Good skin benefits too. * I've been looking for a drug store dupe for my ilia serum skin tint and sadly this is not it. It was patchy on my dry skin and also made me look so washed out. I got this because with the serum title I thought it would help my skin look dewy etc. * I bought this in the shade light natural and it is true (as the other reviews state) that the serum will be a lot lighter than the packaging color when applied to the face. It wasn't too far from my skincolor so it wasn't much of a problem for me. I would rebuy a darker shade next time. I loved this product much more than I expected tbh. I'm not a big fan of heavy makeup/skincare and this felt lightweight enough for me to us it as my foundation. It feels nice throughout the day but will get patchy as well. * I love how it feels. I am 52 with mature combination skin. It wears well and last all day at the office. * This sucked alllllll the moisture out of my skin in a matter of hours!! I can see how it would work and look beautiful on someone with the right skin match for it, but my skin really just did not agree. My skin is still burning. * I expected this to be much lighter coverage than what it is; a heavy, thick foundation that made my skin feel like it couldn't breathe. 

The color was also much lighter than expected although it was truly neutral, which is a nice switch from most makeup that leans (and oxidizes) peach or orange. * The color match was okay, i reeeaaally wanted to love it but the inly thing is it made me break out that very same day /: i honestly loved the way it looked though! Light weight & looks pretty natural, nothing too dramatic. For my acne prone gals, i wouldnt leave this on alllll day, maybe for like some hours (less than 8 hours per say) i would buy again tbh but i just wouldn't recommend to wear it allll day like i did to the point it made me grow blind pimples (the worst) it looks very nice with setting powder! Doesnt get too oily (with setting powder) maybe my forehead looked more oily, my nose was oily but not as bad as my forehead (nothing toooo crazy)"

I work in a cooler all day so trust this helps my skin! * I will say that I have used this product in the past. Its not too bad for the price of the product. However, the coverage is very light and not really buildable. Although, I do like how it gives a somewhat dewy effect. I also like how it has clean ingredients! So if you like dewy foundation, light coverage, and clean ingredients then this product might be for you. * I rarely wear foundation, largely because I hate how heavy it feels on my face, and I also love my freckles and foundations tend to cover them. I bought this out of curiosity and I'm surprisingly happy with the result! It's a pretty watery consistency, but that means A) a little goes a long way, especially when applied with a foundation brush, and B) it feels so light on my face!! It evened out my skin tone (as someone with vitiligo, this is always a big win!!) without totally covering my freckles. It looks super natural, too. I appreciate the price for the amount of product and the fact that it has no scent. 

The one con for me is that my nose felt kind of greasy a few hours later—but the rest of my face felt pretty dry, so that could just be my overactive pores LOL.

For reference, I am very pale (and I have vitiligo). I'm using shade 520- Fair. * It smelt soooo bad bro, i put it on twice, once to try and another to actually go out and then when i did it to go out it started peeling and looked SOOOOO cakey, like cakier than cakey. It smells TERRIBLE, when i was applying it i had to hurry since it smelt sooo bad, i can even explain fbe scent, but its just plain terrible, dont recommend * As I enter my mid-twenties, I've transitioned from the thick, full-coverage foundations of my adolescence to more lightweight and natural finishes. I bought this with the hopes of it being a bit more full coverage than a regular tinted moisturizer.

The color match is great, no quarrels there. It is also a great base for makeup and blends very smoothly with a beauty blender. I am, however, disappointed in the coverage. It is a very sheer foundation - it mostly just does color correction and levels out skin color. It does not do much for acne scars or dark circles. Also make sure to exfoliate and moisturize, as this will cling to dry patches. It also seems to fade a bit throughout the day.

Overall, it's a decent tinted moisturizer. Look elsewhere for lightweight with coverage. * Both my teens use this and love it. Provides a good light coverage without to much of a makeup look. * The sheerest tinted moisturizer i have. On good rosacea days i can wear this over light concealer. It feels lightweight because it is super runny."

It also looks a bit cakey but i highly recomend spraying do we setting spray onto your brush/sponge, and then blending out. * I normally wear Estee stay matte foundation but I was out and until it arrived I needed something in the meantime. I wore this out, was standing in the parking lot talking to my friends and some random lady walked up to us and said ""sorry to interupt but I just have to tell you, you are stunning"" ( she was talking to me) And then she walked off. I was never told that when I wore the Estee! What the heck, this stuff is GOLD. * I have been using this foundation for 5 years now. I will say it is not full coverage but it is buildable. This foundation feels so lightweight & it gives such a natural look. I've tried other foundations but always come back to this one cause its just so good! I tend to have an oily T-zone & everywhere else is pretty much dry but this foundation doesn't ever really cake or flake on me. I 100% recommend this foundation for an everyday natural look! * I love this foundation! it's affordable and stays on all throughout the work day * this foundation is surprisingly good for the price. it's buildable, smooth, and has a nice matte but natural finish. it flaked on my chin area after a few hours, but that could be my skin type. * Love this for my combo skin. I'm not extremely oily but I needed something that would actually last throughout the day without needing to powder by midday. I actually like it better than the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I am shade 090 in Lancome but have not been able to find a good color match as 090 is too light and the next shades are too dark and orange. I have very fair neutral skin. I prefer how the covergirl looks, it is very smooth with slightly better coverage, and L20 is a great shade and a closer match than the Lancome (maybe L20 is a dash too light but it looks perfect after bronzer). It gives a natural matte finish that doesn't cling or look cakey. Works well on my middle-age skin with fine lines. Has great medium-full coverage. Highly recommend! * I really love this foundation and I will continue to purchase it! Affordable and covers well."

Very waterproof and looks great, liquid to powder type foundation. I enjoy that and it's full coverage when built up, not cake. Shade light medium is a perfect match! I'm sticking up, it's worth it! * this foundation was great. it was a little on the cheap side so i knew it wasn't going to be amazing, but it gets the job done. WAIT! but don't stop reading because there is a flaw. the foundation goes on very dry unlike other foundations which glide smoothly across the face. hope this helps. * I have to admit, I like this better than higher end makeup * The foundation seperates and it is not blendable. I have to use lots of concealer to look better. * that's the shade range… horrible * I typically go straight to MAC when purchasing foundation. I purchased this foundation and I waa impressed. I wanted to try a new product that is inexpensive and matched my complexion. Now, I find myself going in Ulta just to see if they have restocked. Even when I sweat, the makeup still looks flawless. I am so excited about this foundation and feel like my appearance has been enhanced due to formula!! Will continue to buy more! * This foundation has blown me away. I don't understand the negative reviews. It is a little runny, so shaking the bottle well beforehand is a must. But the coverage is fantastic. It dries down to a semi matte finish, doesn't accentuate texture, doesn't cling to my dry spots, nor does it make me  too oily (I have combo skin). It holds up in heat and humidity! The shade range may run a little light. I got the medium neutral thinking it would be good for when I self tan, but it actually somehow works even when I haven't tanned. Its lightly fragranced but the scent doesnt linger. Overall a great product and I keep reaching for it. Will definitely repurchase - it outperforms more expensive foundations."

And leaves weird marks on my nose that I cant blend out and have to literally use my nails to scratch off. I have oily skin and never experienced this with a powder foundation. * I have fair skin and got the recommended color. It's too yellow for me and honestly isn't as good as the dermablend camo. I only got it because I can't find the dermablend camo anywhere. This doesn't stay on my skin very well and rubs off so easily. * I am 39 years old, and I have struggled to find a powder foundation that would work for my combo skin, I have spent tons of money, looked high and low, and have never been happy with anything that I found in the past. I could not believe how well, this held up for me! I am 39 years old and I had a baby nine months ago and don't have much time to do my make up but I still wanna look half decent when I have to go out of the house and this is quick and easy and effortless, I highly recommend this to anybody who cannot seem to find a powder foundation that works for them, maybe you might meet your match with this one. I do use the little sponge that comes with the powder because it works for me and I don't want to try to mess withthe system lol. * If your ever going for a simple quick look thsi is the foundation powder to use, the shade match is incredible accurate,decent coverage for a sinple quick look. I definitely recommend!!"

It was on sale for a reason. Disappointed as I need my foundation to be both full coverage and matte, but this dries extremely quickly and I'm an oily face girl and even this was so beyond dry. I got the light shade and it completely ghosted me out. Hot mess foundation. * Don't like the texture * Very thick, not as thick when I apply with a damp sponge. It's too yellow for my skin tone, so I mix with a small amount of peach LA Girl Pro Concealer. It's too heavy for me to wear every day, but I worked an event yesterday in 100-degree heat (Georgia) and it didn't budge or separate as long as I blotted my face. Not sure I'll buy or wear all the time, but it's good to have on hand when I need it! * I dont know if the tube i bougnt was defective, but WOW is this foundation awful. Its SO THICK in texture and sits right on top of my pores, accentuating them while it refuses to blend. Its so greasy i cant even wash it off my hands unless i use dish soap. Despite having the texture of oil paint, somehow the coverage is also fairly sheer??? How!! The only positive thing i can say is that it was cheap. * Have purchased this foundation twice already & always gets compliments on it! Super full coverage and buildable! Have yet to find my right shade but just mix it with other ones, so no complaints really. Would reccomend if you have oily skin. * I usually get the Fair to Medium Light! It doesn't take much and it lasts all day! * Wrong shade.  Salespeople were not at all helpful - Stock very low."

It looks natural and has buildable coverage. For the price, you cannot beat it, I own foundations double the price and this is now my go to. Give it a shot. :D * I bought this like a month ago and I love it! You dont have to use a lot and literally your face is flawless. One of the things i love about this product is it doesnt dry out your skin. I got the shade neutral 25 and id say that its a mix of fair and tan. I also really love the application part of it, the wand is really nice!!! * Covers a lot without having to apply a ton. Love the application wand * I love this foundation I find myself reaching for it more  often than the others. it's not drying, not greasy,  the coverage looks like my skin but glowy, and not cakey. The kiko Milano powder is awesome too for baking BTW. This foundation is way very similar to TF Born this way foundation, (but not as greasy) kiko milano is underrated IMO. Yes I would recommend. * Good color and application, but really accentuates wrinkles. * I'm a fair to light olive undertone. I bought 2 shades, WB15 and WB25. WB25 was away too dark. I thought WB15 would match until I went in the sun it was Soo orange. disappointed. formula is good and coverage is great, just wish I can find a shade. * I like how this felt and it looked great.  Then i touched my face and prints! then this was be a matte look. I was shiny as all get out. Too much for something I would not let anyone else borrow"

Blended like a dream, gorgeous satin finish, blurred imperfections, clean and fragrance free.  The color 1C was actually a cool tone, this new 1C is PEACH toned....very warm, and the formula change truly makes me sad....it's not the same. They ruined a perfect product. * I absolutely love this product! The smell is a bit strong and the application is a little off-putting, but it blends great and looks great! I found that instead of using a traditional primer like elf power grip, using a setting spray to prime made application easier and blending smoother. * My skin looked worse with this. Highlighying pores no matter how much or how many different methods i use. And shows every bump, dry patch, etc. its so weird. Like the opposite of why we wear makeup in the first place. So mad i was fooled that im writing a review * I have very fair and pink skin and have always had trouble finding foundations that match my tone, never mind work well on my oily/combination skin, but I will say that this one does a good job! I was nervous buying online without match testing, but I got the 1C and would say its a pretty good match for my skin tone. 

My pros for this are definitely: generaly matches my skin, works well with my oily/combination skin, it coming in a stick format is very convenient and mess free, stays on very well, looks natural, and doesnt make my skin feel gross

My cons would be: not the perfect match (wish the undertones were more p and that the shade was slightly lighter), can get a little cakey if i put too much on, and a little hard to blend. 

For context I've been wearing Too Faced Born this way foundation in the shade Snow for years now because it's the only foundation I've found that comes close to matching my skin, but I've always run into the same problem of not being able to apply the foundation too thick because then you can tell it's not a true match. Anyway, I would say overall thi one does a better job, has better ingredients, feels better on my skin, and is a good price point.

My last points would be dont let the 1 star reviews scare you, this foundation is very nice and as long as you use a wet sponge to apply and don't mind the mild scent of castor oil that fades in about 30 minutes :) * The old formula was amazing.  Shade 1C was a perfect cool tone as described.  This newer version is very peach in tone and no longer qualifies as cool toned.  So  if you are a fair, cool toned person...look elsewhere. * I have come back to this product again and again after trying other hydrating foundations that are too thin and messy or settle into pores. This is my favorite non-SPF foundation. It is like a natural version of cover girl compact makeup. It's vegetable oil based so it does smell like olive oil. But it's so nourishing and convenient with the solid stick. It smooths on well to a medium coverage and natural dewy finish that doesn't settle into my pores or cause breakouts for me. And with a light powder to set, it stays all day. I do wish they had lighter shades as the lightest warm (2W) is a bit dark for me in winter. But I'm a repeat customer of this good clean dry skin foundation option. * This brand is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I live in the desert and ingredients like hyaluronic acid just pull the water out of your skin because there's no water in the air here. It seemed like every make up and skincare brand hopped on that train and I couldn't find anything for my skin (dry) and climate type. I hope they never change the formula! I'm almost 30 and I'm starting to get crows ft etc and this really does a great job of camouflage without settling in any wrinkles."

Super thick, matte and cakey but superior coverage to anything made ever. * Please bring it back!!!! Nothing compares * My favorite and un replaceable foundation. I haven't found a similar to this one not one!!! This is the best foundation for OILY skin and tge coverage amazing. Loved that it last all day mind you i live in Az and the weather is HOT this foundation would not move at all. Pleas eplease being this back because Good Apple is not close at all in coverage and wear. * This was the only matte foundation i found that made my textred mature skin not look more textured and makes me look older like all other matte foundations I've tried! This one looks so amazing. Stayed all day and i sweat alot on my face. I really dont know why they got rid of this foundation. I literally have not one bad thing to say about this foundation.

There is no good reason for testing on animals and there are plenty of good products available which ARE CRUELTY FREE too. * I purchased this on a whim as i saw it on sale. I received it at the same time another package with the new Prada foundation came in, and I'm shocked that i like the Lorac foundation more than the Prada!  I applied this with my Hourglass foundation brush as the formula is quite thin amd it went on beautifully. Its so smooth and the finish really is a soft matte. It seems to be very long lasting as well. My first favorite foundation of the year. * I finally got my hands on this foundation and I wore it and loved it right away! I will say if you're sensitive to smells it does smell like paint but it will fade. This foundations lasts all day and blurred my acne scared skin & pores. obsessed! * Lorac left no choice but to select this when they quit making the PoreFection foundation.  This has no sunscreen and it has an odor similar to molasses. I use it because it doesn't break my face out. * I love it one of the reasons I love it is because it doesn't crease and settle in my  lines and it's very very hard to find products they don't do that. I can't get over the coverage when I first tried it I was so skeptical, because it is runny and well, it just didn't seem like it was gonna be that great…! And it is in my opinion…  To apply it I use a beauty blender and it goes on amazing and for me honestly a little bit goes a long way. … I have large pores texturize skin, but yet this one seems to work good for me and not feel too heavy.… I wouldn't say it's totally water resistant, but good enough because let me tell you I've cried while having it on and it does not streak not at all at least not for me and like I said,  I'm almost 46 years old. I'm a 45 year old woman so it's been a struggle for me and I know other people have been saying a lot of different things then I am saying, but I know for me personally it is one of my favorites and always will be! And I highly recommend for more mature skin… I really really do … I have used a brush with it before and it does work good as well. Not a matte either. Just a beautiful natural finish not too dewy. Put it to you this way whenever I use the Lorac foundation, I always get compliments oh, and before I forget, it does not crease on my eyelids, and that is one of my biggest pet peeves ever 😂. * Since the perfection foundation was discontinued I thought this pro version would somehow be better. It is not. It is very heavy coverage and cakes on. It truely smells like maple syrup. Laura Mercier makes a tinted moisturizer w SPF that is more like porefection formerly by Lorac. * I HATE this foundation.  I used the lorac sheer porefection foundation foe years. when it was discontinued I was upset but thought I would give this new product a try.  I used a primer under. I used an applicator sponge. it is terrible. it is thick. I was hoping this would equate to better coverage.  no such luck. it settles into pores and fine lines. it looks chalky on the skin. it transfers easily. I HATE this foundation.  😒"

I don't think this is one of them.  It's the old school sort--the kind that feels very waxy.  If you have dry skin, you will not be pleased.  It's very hard to get the finish to look good, and even harder to get it to stay looking good.  It's probably not going to save you time or make your life easier on the go. * I am blown away by how amazing this stick foundation is!! It gives a barely there feeling which i love. It does not settle into fine lines and stays on all day. Can't wait to try more stuff from the brand!!! * This stick goes on sooo smoothly! Absolutely love the consistency of this makeup! My skin looked like a barely there makeup look, exactly what i was going for. Definitely need to extend the shade range of this makeup but other than that this stuff is amazing!! * great coverage for my skin tone and felt smooth.  please add more skin tones so all people can have it. * this shade range has every type of tone for lighter skin but for 1 dark complexion do better * I honestly dont unserstand why people who've never tried this give it a low rating due to the shade range. This is an Italian owned brand. Majority of the population is olive, light to medium skintones. Many of them/us have a hard time finding our shades. Go try Fenty Beauty if you dont like it. Anyways, this is fantastic. Super blendable and looks smooth on my texture. * the shade range is disgusting. its not like italy is a sheltered country or anything, many POC reside there. darker women, men, and all in between deserve to have products that fit their skin too. do better."

I hate the feeling of foundation so I just prefer something super light to even out my color and mattify me. This stuff is perfect! It feels completely weightless and looks natural. It wears off gradually by the end of the day without looking crazy. Definitely my favorite face makeup! * It wiped off easily didn't  stay on my face. I would use it in a certain spot and i would try and apply it somewhere else and it would wipe off * As for color match, it's perfect. But it doesn't really cover up my imperfections like age spots * Looks great on my skin. * Very light coverage. Feels so light and soft on skin. Not oily after a full day of wear! Doesn't cover blemishes the best but will give a nice even tone over the skin. Blends nicely! * I loved this! Its very light weight. I used under this my normal skin car rountine.

This one is up there with the more high end serum foundations in every way but without the crazy price tag. It is sheer - exactly what I like! - and blends like a dream. It has staying power and flattering shades. A little goes a long way. It plays well with other products both cream and powder. No moisturizer needed as it is very hydrating - my dry mature skin drinks this up and loves it! Very happy! * I've got combination skin with an oily t-zone and dry on my forehead and underneath my eyes, this doesn't bring any of this texture out! It's light coverage which I like for daily wear and for hot days. * It's so light! Def what I was looking for. Just a psa to anyone who wants to buy this, I'd suggest buying at AT THE store because I ordered it and received it with the product spilled. Still product in the bottle, but I for some reason can't put it sideways or it leaks. So if you order it online, be aware either the bottle is just awful or it broke while it was shipping to me. 
Other than that it's a wonderful product * I have used way too many foundations from luxury to drug store and this is by far the one I always want to reach for and have a back up. I have to force myself to use other foundations. I have normal to dry skin with some hyperpigmentation and prefer light coverage foundations that looks like skin. I use a smoothing primer in my pore areas, do two pumps with a drop of oil, dab it onto my skin and blend with a brush and this always makes my skin look absolutely flawless. No caking around my nose or forehead areas. Throughout the day, it continues to melt into my skin and look better and better. I can imagine this wouldnt be ideal with those with oily skin or who want more coverage, but for me this is the gold standard and what I put all of my other foundations/skin tints against. * I think you would have to have perfect skin to like this. Absolutely no coverage. Your face just looks wet. * My makeup aesthetic goals are ""awake, and not languishing away from consumption"", and this foundation is great for that. Sheer, doesn't settle into fine lines, leaves my skin smooth and hydrated and flawless. Add a quick dab of blush and mascara and boom, people stop asking me if I've been ill."

It is so thick it won't pump out. The foundation is clumpy and doesn't spread at all. Why did they change a good product???? * This foundation is worth trying! Creamy, spreads nicely (I use a brush), nice colour matching (I consider myself a medium brown skin colour). Overall great product! * I cannot say enough GOOD THINGS about this CC cream. There comes the point when foundation is out, and CC cream is in, and I am pleased with this product's color choices, smooth texture, and luminescence. I mix two shades and apply the first color as a primer. This CC cream doubles as my concealer; it's that easy to apply. * This product: separates BADLY and doe not blend well at all; Smells weird and chemical-y; offers VERY little coverage, even for a CC cream, and is overpriced because of all these factors. Positives: it makes skin glowy and has SPF. I wouldn't buy this personally - Pacifica's skincare and fragrance are AMAZING, but makeup seems to be a weak point. * This product came out separated. Tried shaking product to get product mixed together and it came out somewhat like foundation. Does not go on skin nicely.

It is a great product for the price. * I have purchased this product before and I liked it. This time the product was used. It had a finger smudge print on it when l opened it and the sponge applicator had make all on one side. I ended up purchasing something else at another store. * First, note this has the ingredients that Danessa Myricks uses for her foundation at an affordable cost. This provides a great shade match, makes skin look healthy and even, easy to take with you and stays on even if you sweat. The magnesium carbonate in the formula absolutely is wonderful for sweaty moments. I just find you can't really apply it with anything other than a sponge. Brushes with dense round tops don't pick it up well, as nothing else does. If you don't want to buy a beauty sponge you'll be fine to use the one it comes with. * Great shade for Hispanic women. * Too dark/matched my hand-too dark for my face * My mom loves this foundation and looks forward to trying more products from the line"

I had to go back and get another powder the next day because I couldn't handle it. Also, for some reason, it irritated my skin. I would not recommend this product. * This powder is not only affordable but it sits on my skin very nicely. I use it all over my face including my eyes. Pairs well with First Aid Beauty eye cream. * For the price this brand is solid. Would definitely recommend! * I loved this powder. Specially to set up the concealer… is great. My skin is combo. This product highlight my under eyes area and no creases , stay long,  and look beautiful. * If you have rough texture or lines it will show. But if your skin is pretty smooth it works great, only issue I ran into was dry skin patches but was an easy fix with a moisturizer underneath. I would definitely buy again. I usually use IT cosmetics foundation powder, but actually prefer this one for the price. * It wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't agree with my skin or skincare. It did end up looking cakey/separated after about 2 hours. * Got this on a whim since it was affordable.

Girl Tinted Foundation in my local Ulta's clearance section and figured I'd give it a try. When I got home, I used Ulta's shade matcher and it told me I was really Warm Sand in this product (based off entering Ginger for bareMineral's COMPLEXION RESCUE Tinted Moisturizer Mineral SPF 30). Warm Sand perfectly matches my skin right now during the winter. I'll try Tawny again in the spring/summer, but it was a close match too. I love how lightweight this product feels and how easy it is to apply — I dot it on right from the tube and the dab/blend with a lightly moist makeup sponge. It looks just slightly dewy but doesn't feel overly wet or sticky. It also works well under my bareMinerals BAREPRO 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation if I want to look more made up, but between the price and its natural look when used solo, it fits well with my minimalist approach to makeup. * I am 66 years old. It settled into my wrinkles and emphasized them.  Very sheer coverage. Not a good choice for me. * This is amazingggg!! it's creamy and dries so you don't need any powder, the finish is a natural satin finish and i have dry skin NC42 and the tan is perfection! * I love this foundation its a good one if you're looking for an affordable foundation thats light to medium coverage. I have pink on my cheeks and this covers it just enoiggt to not be seen. You cant beat that for the price."

If unsure, go a bit darker than normal. * I ordered 2W - Warm light - and it was almost white, so light and clearly defective. It did absolutely nothing other than make me have a Casper look. It is so sheer I can't imagine it doing anything even if it was the correct color.  I contacted Well People, I thought they should know how bad the product was, and they didn't care. * W3ll people... we need to talk about the shade range. People with darker skin tones like makeup too yet the shade range completely excludes anyone beyond tan. Thankfully the darkest shade works for me so I enjoy the product but it's hard to get behind a brand that doesn't give darker skintones a thought. * I was really hoping this product would work for me but it didn't. I found the baked foundation to be much more drying than other pressed powders I've previously used. Felt like it didn't go on well and had horrible coverage. Will not be buying again. * Takes forever to build up. Not for anyone who wants medium to full coverage. Light to medium at best. * Honestly if you're looking for a foundation to take a chance on.. this is definitely it. I'm not sure why I even chose to buy this but I love it!! I use it over concealer and it evens out my skin tone perfectly. Also does not make me look too orangey or cakey. * Just meh"

It was so easy to apply, felt nice on my skin, looks natural and I think m10 is my shade - it is spot on (for my beautiful summer complexion ) I'm excited to have found Mented! not a con for me, because i don't choose a makeup to smell good, but definitely seems like fragrance wasn't added.

I have pretty dry sky so I know to add a moisturizer before applying this. I am not saying this drying…but makeup ondry skin can appear patchy * This product feels and looks like you have no product on. * I have searched for the perfect match years! So excited to have finally found a shade so spot on with my skin tone that it's almost scary. The stick foundation is easy to apply, blends well and leaves me a great natural glow. * Looked awful on me. Horrible on oily skin and def dont get if you have light skin. This foundation isnt made for light skin tones which sucks. * Perfect match almost feels like a tinted moisturizer. I'm oily so I still need a powder but for stick makeup it goes on smooth and doesn't run off. I'm sold * Okay so hear me out.. the color match to my skin is amazing!!! it blended beautifully. However, I have combo oily skin and nothing could have prepared me for how shiny and oily this foundation is. This is not a matte foundation so beware!! * Hidden Gem hands down. I have been looking for a good foundation in general for a few years now, I went high end low end drugstore I went tinted moisturizer to full coverage and non did what I actually wanted. I love make up but finding a good foundation for my oily skin that wont force me to re touch (which I'm horrible at by the way, always makes it worse) was close to impossible without making me feel like I have pounds of make up on especially for work. I had tried the Hourglass foundation stick which was highly rated and felt very chalky on my skin. I did a search of stick foundations and came across this one. I am the lightest shade in this line and am on my way to re up for a 3rd time! I have never purchased 1 item more than once since they end up not working out for a while. The coverage is amazing from one layer to a 2 layers if I want a fuller look. It glides on like butter on my skin  and gives me a glow without an oily look if that makes sense. I rarely have to completely set my face because it sets so nice on its own and will literally last me over 9 hours without any cracks or separation and looks like I just applied it minutes ago. It makes my face feel hydrated and not like I'm wearing loads of make up. This is a long review and I never leave a review but I am truly in love with this foundation! I am so thankful for this brand because I am the in between when it comes to make up, I'm a semy fare complexion with neutral undertones. Many lines have a Yellow undertone or an olive undertone which makes me look washed out. This is truly a bang for your buck and will leave your make up looking flawless."

I can go on about this foundation forever. I have very pale, dry skin, this shade range cancels out any issues ive had with light foundations that are too orange, does not stick to or emphasize when i have dryness. I 100% recommend this product. * This doesn't settle in wrinkles like a lot of foundation.  It is a bit hard to use to start with but once you figure it out it's very nice.  Good for older and younger skin.  I'm 64 and it's the best I've ever used. * This foundation is perfect for evening out skin tone without making it look like you painted your make up on. I really love pairing it with cream contour and cream blush, and then just setting it with a setting spray- it gives a gorgeous dewy finish. You can set it with powder to make it a little more long lasting too. I always try to catch it on sale. I think having a gorgeous light coverage foundation like this is perfect for an interview, meeting someone new, or embracing your natural beauty! Its made me feel so much more confident in my own skin. * The origin to my villain story. I listened to an ULTA employee, first foundation for my high school homecoming. Three days later I broke out, having clear skin all my life. Ever since, it never stopped. I had to go on meds to cure my acne. Don't use. * I used to use the old face and body without the radiance and always loved it so im not surprised I love the new version especially because I like more of a sheen/glow to my skin. This is a very sheer coverage foundation but is buildable if you want a little more coverage. Also I can apply this over my skincare without it pilling! * I never tried the original face and body. Honestly, I was never interested in this foundation until I started watching Miss Megan Robinson on tik tok. Seriously you NEED to follow her!! I generally have oily skin. It's been a lot more calm, and a lot less oily after I got rid of all the actives, and JUST started washing, toning, and using AN OIL (I know right, but it's true, oil loves oil, using an oil will keep your skin from producing a lot of oil) I can now wear this foundation confidently, and it is BEAUTIFUL!! It's friction activated so I suggest applying with fingers and rubbing it in so you can start to feel the ""gripping and thickening"" action that happens with this foundation(which is the best most fun part for me). The coverage is obviously light but it looks like perfected skin. Only the best things are peeking through. Everything blends nicely on top, and I mean EVERYTHING, from all different brands. It wears great too and looks even better as the day goes on. Its softly radiant and skin like if you powder (which I still do) and if you don't you'll look like a freshly hot glazed donut (some people like that, some people don't) I get the hype of this foundation and dare I say it's made it into my top 5 line up!!?? Coming from an oily girl that is shocking. If you're wondering, I use the Danessa Myricks yummy skin balm in translucent as a primer, this foundation, all my other creams and liquids, and I set with Mac studio fix powder and one size setting spray.

It look so beautiful like natural skin! It doesn't dry matte, so definitely set it with powder. I'd say a little goes a long way! It last all day & still look beautiful even after a workout. The only areas that would slightly crease would be around my smile lines & chin but nothing crazy. I wish the foundation would be more available but it's so hard to find & the shade range isn't the best but overall 10/10 I would recommend! My closest shade is A05.5. I also tried mixing V05 & V04 to get my shade if anyone is wondering. I hope this helps.  :) * Coming from an Ulta Employee, after trying every foundation under the sun, this foundation makes my skin look FLAWLESS, airbrushed, smooth. I do have to set with a translucent loose powder because it is still a little tacky in my opinion. Shades are FANTASTIC. A02 matches me the closest; however if there was a slightly paler shade with a yellow undertone that would be my perfect match. I ordered A01 and A02 on YesStyle and to me 1 was almost darker than 2, but it may just be the undertones. ULTA PLEASE BRING THIS BACK. It took me over a week with express shipping on YS btw I paid $19 extra FYI In case anyone was going to order it, I think it ships from China. Idk what is in this foundation but  I want to buy every bottle just incase it ever gets discontinued😅😭😭😭 * My relationship with foundation is a nightmare,I'm a brown skin girl with golden undertones in the summer and pale skin in the winter,without much prep this foundation matched me perfectly and stayed on ALL NIGHT,the a night of dancing 💕LOVE THIS STUFF * Please restock ASAP! This is my favorite foundation!! I literally bought 3 bottles because I have a feeling Ulta might discontinue this foundation...
 FYI- you can still find VDL on Yesstyle BUT it's NOT the same foundation. The one on Yesstyle has SPF & it has more of a dewy finish 😩 * I hope Ulta is not going to stop selling this foundation. It is an amazing satin finish foundation. Looks flawless on the skin and makes blemished skin look smooth. Wears beautifully throughout the day and is full coverage. Highly recommend. FYI if they stop selling it at Ulta you can find it on YesStyle. * I bought this foundation in the color A06. I tend to have a hard time finding foundations because I am in the weird shade range where I'm typically between medium/tan and dark/deep in various brands. I have Neutral slightly golden/olive undertones and find that many brands get close but not perfectly my shade. Most times foundations are too golden (almost orange looking), too cool, exactly neutral when I need just a touch of yellow in the foundation, or they just skip my shade altogether. I was pleasantly surprised when this foundation was an exact match. I love the natural finish to this foundation. I have dehydrated combo skin that if not properly hydrated will get oily in the t-zone (mostly nose area) and will remain normal or slightly dry everywhere else. When I wear this for several hours my foundation goes from very natural to radiant but not oily as my t-zone starts to break into a bit of a shine. I really don't have anything bad to say about this foundation except because of the limited shade range there's a chance you may not find a good match depending on your skin tone and undertone. Hopefully Ulta continues to keep this foundation available. * I would describe this foundation on my skin as full coverage with a satin/slight dewy finish. I have acne prone skin with acne scars and this foundation covers everything without causing any texture. Long wearing and mask proof. Doesn't cause breakouts. Would recommend for various skin types."

The ""creamy"" title is very deceiving though. It's powder. And quite drying immediately on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this for aging skin whatsoever. Great product for on the go touch ups on oily skin. * I don't care for the sponge applicator because it really doesn't go on right, but I found that using a brush to apply is so much better and it goes on more evenly.  You can add more where needed without it looking blotchy.  I love it! Used the color Sienna * Goes smooth and cover some imperfections, but looks natural. Leaves your skin soft and beautiful. * Lightest shade, Ivory.  You MUST prep the skin with moisturizer, sunscreen and either CT Hollywood Flawless Filter or the Maybeline knockoff or a dewy primer or sunscreen.  Buff in with a brush after applying concealer where needed.  Use powder bronzer, blush and highlight and a setting spray.  It looked amazing on my 48 year old dry skin and lasted all day.  Not powdery, didn't settle in lines, let's your skin peek through (is light coverage).   I really love it. * I thought since it's called age perfect it would be a moisturizing creamy powder. Nope. It's super drying and I have combination oily skin not even dry. Feels horrible right on application You can feel the makeup. Didn't blur anything. I had to take it off within 10 mins of application. Don't buy this stuff. * I wanted to try a cream to powder foundation to try to cover some dark spots. 
This covered what I wanted. It does look a little dry after application but I'm oily so it looks more natural after a few hours. * I love the age rewind concealer and seen this after looking for a good powder foundation. it is a really creamy, finely milled powder. I don't think it's really pigmented but you get enough coverage to even everything out and in my opinion it really does blur. I use a flat top Kabuki brush to buff it in, slowly building up layers. I take product and tap it in where I need more coverage with a concealer brush. I find I get the most coverage this way. it's like your skin but better. gives you a nice natural finish and doesn't look cakey if you slowly buff and build. will be trying this as a setting powder for liquid since it blurs. it also doesn't make me breakout!"

Unfortunately, This product didn't work for my dry skin. And for the price I doesn't have great coverage. I don't see this product any different from any other pressed powder. Also, this powder has sparkles in it I guess to conceal how drying and powdery it makes the skin.. * I love this powder, my skin is dry but this powder always feels comfortable on, never adds any texture as other powders have for me in the past, def one of my fav powders * I LOVE this pressed powder! It takes away the look of shine and makes my skin look refined and even toned. I bought Ivory and it is the ideal shade for my skin tone, medium fair with pink undertones. It works well worn over concealer and foundation, or on its own. And, better still, it looks invisible and feels like nothing on skin! The mirrored compact is the perfect size for taking on the go and it even comes with an applicator sponge on a clear, hinged divider inside. Hynt thought of everything with this pressed powder! I will definitely buy again:) * I've always been reluctant to wear powder - most of the time I end up looking cake-y. This finishing powder is a game changer - so easy to apply and bonus, the packaging is so adorable! But more importantly my skin looks so velvety and super plump, definitely will be coming back for more when I'm through with this! * Love using this powder in-between zoom meetings to touch up my skin. Just gives me a more even/finished and natural look * One of my favorite products from Hynt * I used this foundation with the foam puff it came packaged with. Do not use with a brush, the powder is finely milled and will fall off your brush! I wore it over serum and moisturizer. My face got a little shiny throughout the day but that is common for me, as I have combination skin. I like that the coverage is buildable, I was able to apply two layers and achieved the coverage I was looking for. Best of all, the ingredients are natural and truly clean! No SLS, no parabens, no Lauryl Lysine, no Bismuth oxychloride! So happy Ulta is carrying this brand!"

I recommend performing a gentle face exfolation before bed time and removing any peach fuzz for any makeup aplication, not just this foundation. It makes a huge difference in aplication and appearance of the final look/finish.
It works best with the Vanish smoothing primer. (To smooth down the pores that every human being has) It is runny but extreamly pigmented. Do not use too much or it will look cakey.Best apply with a dense buffer brush (Morphe 444 is my favorite) and then press it in with a beauty blender. I use the professional Kryolan setting spray first, and then set it with a good powder.( Jeffree Star, Fenty or Kryolan powder) It holds for 14h even in humid Florida. Best foundation for events. It's best for normal/ combination skin. I wish they had more shades.
Unfortunately it just has been discontinued, tho the company has gave me insites that they are working on perfecting the formula and making a new foundation for combination/oily skin (they currently carry luminous foundations for normal/dry skin) * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * This product is so thin & runny! Like water consistency. I pumped one pump on my hand & it literally dripped off me. I shook the bottle so many times & it still remained runny. I gave it a try on my face because I wanted to give the foundation a chance but the product just settled right into any crevice it could. I could literally see wrinkles/lines I didn't even know I had. * I got this during a sale and was so excited to try my first Hourglass product. I followed the instructions and reviews and only used a very little amount. It brings out my pores horribly, dries down very weird and makes my skin dry, and even though it feels light on my skin my skin feels a tiny bit sticky, not something I usually experience with prestige brand foundations. This is a miss for me. * This foundation is very reminiscent of Marc Jacob's 'Remarcable' . Full coverage and matte with a pore filling matte primer underneath . The bad reviews are really just people who don't know how to apply makeup . * Words do not explain how buttery this foundation is I have dry to normal skin and it blends it two to three glides. Will never use another foundation"

I have combo oily skin and so far regardless of the primer or moisturizer this just doesn't look good and will break down. I've been using juvias place which I like ten times better and I don't have to try to make it work. This foundation also oxidizes orange..so not just a shade but it'll turn more orange as well. I'm gonna try to find something to mjx it with but I won't be purchasing again and wouldn't recommend it. * I have oily combo skin, and this foundation did not stand the test of time. It felt very heavy, and transferred with the slightest touch (with setting powder). Only a few hours in, and it was breaking apart on my face, highlighting even the slightest texture. My pores were literally drinking this product up. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a foundation, and could not wait to take it off. * I have combo skin, I use the Bobby brown moisturizer primer underneath and only use a tiny bit with a brush. Looks flawless!! Do not use to much product otherwise it will look cakey, if you need extra coverage apply only to specific area with smaller brush. * 32f (no active breakout/indented scars only on cheeks/combination skin)This foundation has the worst formula I have ever used on my skin. I tried two different primers underneath and tried it on it's own and it just refused to settle or smooth out. It creases badly and makes skin look dry and caked with very minimal use of the product that looked worse and worse if you tried to use even a tiny bit more. Powders and setting spray do nothing to help. I tried beauty blenders and brushes and neither made it better. I ended up going back to a trusty Revlon foundation that was way cheaper and a much better formula. Do not waste your money if you do not have perfect smooth skin. * I have sensitive skin with large amounts of rosacea and occasional eczema. This product covers my redness very well, and can many my dry areas seemingly disappear. Smashbox was also a line that came up multiple times during my search for products best for sensitive skin. * Maybe this just doesn't work with some skin types. I've given this several goes with different amounts of product and application techniques and it always manages to cake up and accentuate every pore after it's settled. I decided to give this one more go, applying after a glowy moisturizer that managed to save some of my other cakey products and it still had the same issues after setting for about 20 minutes. * It has perfect coverage,  a very little goes a long way.  Love the Matt finish I got.  Like  all foundations,  you have to prepare your skin before you applying anything to it.  Use a brush to apply.  I patted it on."
