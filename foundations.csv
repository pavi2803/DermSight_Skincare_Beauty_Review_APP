Ive tried the chanel foundation & hated how textured my skin looked but this beats it by 100000üòÆ‚Äçüí® * I really liked this foundation at first but once it dries up you can't blend it out anymore. If you mess up your makeup during the day, you can't fix it because it will just rub off and not blend well. Terrible!!! * Please don't waste your money. I had high hopes for this foundation after urban decay discontinued the all matter foundation you pay such a big prize for very cheap ingredients. If you have sensitive skin be careful because this has alcohol in it and you can definitely feel it and smell it. This foundation also has other ingredients that are banned in other countries so when it advertises as clean ingredients, that's absolutely false. The coverage is OK. It can get very drying you definitely need to moisturize very very well before applying this foundation unfortunately I have tried other more affordable foundations that have done a better job and have better ingredients. Don't waste your time. If you are conscious about the ingredients you put on your face. * Bring back the All Nighter foundation! * One of the best foundation i have ever use!!! * This is my new holy grail of foundation. I have a super oily T zone and struggled to find a new foundation that would last all day after the KVD lock it foundation got discontinued. This foundation lasts ALL DAY and does not slide around. I set it with powder and only need to reapply a little powder on days that I'm super oily. It does not tranfer at all and is also totally waterproof. I was skeptical when I first bought it but now it is a must have for me!"

The color match was beautiful, but the TRANSFER! I have tried every primer, powder  and setting spray but this transfers on everything. And the smell is odd. * I wanted to love this foundation because I heard so many great things about it but I had to wash it off after 10 minutes because I had an allergic reaction to the fragrance in it. * Product is definitely very hydrating but it oxidizes after a while. * Matches my skin tone perfect feels and looks great my favorite foundation * Ive used pretty much every foundation out there and I have to say this one is # 1 !!!!! Best coverage, color match and longevity. Love everything about it. * its not a full coverage foundation * I have tried many foundations and this will always be my go to. I have acne scars and this covers them and leaves such a glow natural finish. I'm obsessed."

I'd been wanting to try it for a while, and got a great deal. Turns out I ordered the wrong shade, but it ended up being the perfect shade for my concealer! Wore it the other day and got compliments! * Out of all the foundations I've tried - from high end to drugstore this is HANDS DOWN BEST I'VE EVER USED. I have always struggled finding a foundation for my combo/oily skin and this is the only foundation that works for my skin. If you struggle with oily skin and don't want a super cakey and matte look; this is the foundation for you. It is so lightweight and has builable coverage. I dont get shiny til about hour 6 or so and its easily fixable with just setting spray or reapplying just a little bit of powder. It's 100% worth the price * I got this during the 21 DOB sale. I sampled it when looking for a long-wearing foundation this past summer. 

I have a combo skin type & with good skin prep, it looks & wears beautifully. 

This arrived on 9/24/2024. I was busy & didn't open the bubble wrap around the product until almost midnight. I then saw the expiration date of 10/24. 

I contacted Ulta Guest Services. Sandra was a dream to work with. They are sending a new product. * I was between this foundation, estee lauder, and NARS and I ended choosing this one. Being in my early 30s made my skin needs change and this one gave full coverage with a matte finish and it does not sink into my fine lines and even gives a lifted appearance. * I have tried every foundation known to woman. I used EL for years, then when I turned 55 I felt like it didn't look right anymore, so I was on a quest to find something better, lighter, more natural looking. Let me tell you, it's been a disaster of a time, and a very expensive one at that. This was my last try! It didn't work, it didn't look good after 5 hours and Revlon Colorstay looks amazing after 10 hours, only it breaks me out, and I've never broken out in my life. I am going back to EL and will apply with a damp beauty blender. It was my ride or Die for over 20 years. Guess I shouldn't have cheated. * I paired this w their oil free primer and I have the perfect base for 7+ hours in the heat! I've struggled sm with finding products that fit my oily skin type but this is finally the combination that suits me best im in love. If you have an oily face type I def recommend this!! * I picked this up during the Ulta Beauty sale and I can honestly say I'm not mad about it. I've used it a few times and it holds up better than most foundations I've tried and I really like how it makes my skin look. Wears super well and has lasted me for 8 plus hours without having to touch it up."

It is a beautiful lightweight, hydrating formula that can be built up to the coverage you want. It doesnt cake and has a stunning finish. * I absolutely hated this foundation, I really wanted to like it but I applied it with my fingers and my face would feel and look oily. I personally have combination oily skin. I even tried using a primer and the same thing happened. very disappointed * I have combo skin and if i don't prep my skin properly this foundation can be drying. Ive learned that if i mix gobi and Salzburg i get my perfect shade. I prep my skin w rhode glazing milk and elf hydra grip primer and i use a beauty blender to apply i use nars creamy concealer under my eyes and kosas concealer for spot concealing around my face. I set it w kosas powder in tzone and use the Nars light reflecting setting spray. This makes my makeup flawless and last 8 plus hours even my tzone, i'm a hairstylist and this holds even through blow drying hair all day. This routine does not break me out at all, which is crazy because my skin is sensitive and breaks out easily so i can't use anything w fragrance on my face, which non of these products have. My skin is also sensitive to too much Niacidamide which seems to be in everything these days except this (thank goodness) * For the cost ..I would like to have been better instructions. * Where has this foundation been?? I just saw an article raving about this and I went out to see about the hype and glad I did!, makes skin look flawless.... AMAZING * I have uneven, pigmented, textured, older skin and most foundations aren't great on me. This foundation doesn't lift up flaky areas like some serum foundations do. It provides coverage, but isn't mask-like. It does have that light reflecting property that makes my skin look better than it is.  I apply it with a damp Beauty Blender and it lasts all day. It sets up to a very comfortable, nonsticky finish in about five minutes. It's not tricky to apply. And it feels good on my sensitive skin and is weightless. I don't see myself changing foundations. This Nars Light Reflecting is my soulmate. * at 43 I need hydration, medium coverage  and something lightweight! this checks those boxes for me!  doesn't break up , crease or sperate! I think it wears great all day but I also use a griping primer that adds to the longevity!!   

typically I wear skin tints in the hotter months and light to medium coverage rest of the year this feels like a tint but covers like a heavier base! I'm here for it!!"

This new formula is definitely not even close to the original (color, coverage, wear, etc.) and not in a good way. * I can't believe they ruined the foundation I've been wearing for years. It's horrible. The colors have all changed, so I had to return for a different shade. Then after wearing the new shade for a few hours, I realized it's a completely different formula. It oxidizes and it gets blotchy and dry and cakey. It's so awful! Bring the old one back! I'm switching brands now. Never thought that would happen. * MAC, we had a good thing going. This used to be my ride or die. I heard the formula changed. I sampled it. NW13 is now fluorescent orange and it looks terrible. Bye. * This stuff works really good. * 2 star for the shade match (nw10) but this doesn't deserve the other 3 stars. This feels really greasy and heavy on my face even if I only use up to 3 pumps. Also burns a bit because it is heavily fragranced and clogs my pores. I woke up with a big zit on my jawline after wearing this a few days ago too. Don't recommend for sensitive and acne prone skin that gets oily. Fail. * I was so sad to find out that they changed the formula. I find that the appliaction is not as smooth and starts to crease immediately regradless of how you set it. The finish of the foundation is more dewy and I get shinier much faster throughout the day. * I just purchased this brand for the first time.I was using another brand but it wasn't keeping my extremely oily skin at bay. I decided to give this a whirl. I am so surprised that it is a true matte foundation. Coverage is great medium to full. It goes on smooth and the color matches perfectly.My skin does not get slick like with other brands. I have mature skin (51 y/o) and want a foundation to cover blemishes or dark spots. This will do it!  I highly recommend if you have a problem with foundations on oily skin!"

I pitched the two of the Fair 15 Cool and ordered the shade that works from another merchant. Ulta has GREAT sales, so I hate that I couldn't buy what I needed from them. * I love the loose powder so i thought i would try the pressed powder. It went on great. Covered well and looked fantastic at first. Within a couple hours it starts to separate and look cakey. Looks awful by the end of the day * I usually get the loose powder foundation and was nervous this wouldn't be as good. I'm so happy to report, it's better! You don't have to use as much and it applies so seamlessly. So light in weight but heavy duty in coverage! * This product has just enough coverage and goes on quick and easy. Fabulously covers my shiny complexion. * I have been using using bare minerals for a while now as they have products that suit my skin tone and do not cause any breakouts. * I love this product its because I feel like no foundation to wear its light and blend on my skin. * Truly stays on for 16 hours"

Called their customer service and they won't do anything without proof of purchase. It's 2024. Who has a receipt on file? Ridiculous. Disappointing. Rude. * Love the color match, it's hard to find a good yellow base that's not orange. It applies smooth and lasts all day! * I've purchased this product many time.  This line of product is my go to for foundation and concealer.  I love it!! * I use this product daily and it never fails to bring a fresh glow. The foundation looks great under makeup and goes well in mixing other foundations. The formula is lightweight and buildable. * I do love the coverage of this Fenty, however my face is oily and after so long of wearing it made my face look even more oily! I do love the color though! I just wish I didn't have oily skin! * Fenty Beauty by Rihanna's Soft'Lit Naturally Luminous Longwear Foundation in Shade 260 is a game-changer for those seeking a natural, radiant finish with long-lasting wear. The formula feels lightweight yet provides excellent medium coverage, blurring imperfections while keeping skin looking fresh and dewy throughout the day. Shade 260 is ideal for medium skin tones with neutral undertones, blending seamlessly without oxidizing. Its hydrating properties make it perfect for all-day comfort, even on dry skin. Plus, it's buildable, allowing for a flawless, customizable finish that enhances your natural glow. * This is by far the best foundation I have ever used. Gives a great coverage and don't need to use alot of product. This bottle last me about 5/6 months and I beat my face everyday. Great Buy, tons of colors for every skin tone."

I use with a small sponge to apply. * I got a sample of this product and really liked it, so I bought the product. I have pretty oily T-zone and this doesn't wear well thru the day.

It looks great and preforms well with any skincare I've ever worn underneath, including different sunscreens. (PSA - this has SPF but shouldn't be relied upon as your only SPF in a day.) Looks great. The color range seems completely constant across the brand. So if you started with the Doublewear Stay in Place and were looking for something lighter and more natural finish, you can choose your ""usual"" shade. * I have worn the double wear sheer foundation in dessert beige for years. They changed it so much; it is hardly the same foundation now. The double wear in full coverage is too much for aging skin (I find). I looked at the serum tint and it was clearly too oily for me and too sheer. The hydra rescue, on the other hand, is the new deal. A lot of sun protection, just enough coverage. And most importantly I finally matched the color the right way and that is to my neck. Turns out I was never desert beige, I am exactly Ecru. Who knew! It can look flaky if you don't have a moisturized enough base. Also, start with a smaller amount, then build up coverage as needed to avoid caking. Other than that, it stays on and does not easily transfer. * I love the formula. It's highly pigmented so a thin layer is plenty, you don't feel like you're wearing anything. The only problem is the tube it's in is the worst foundation container I've ever had. I dismissed other reviews of people complaining bc I thought maybe it was user error, I was wrong. The pump leaks everywhere leaving a huge mess every time you use it. * This product is very runny, which I read in the reviews.  It doesn't take a lot of product to cover, and I really like the color (Fresco) and how it disappears after application.  My face feels hydrated most of the day after use.  I did detect a slight odor, but it was very faint, and it goes away quickly.  You just have to be careful, removing it from the tube.  Plan on it being a little messy.  I do like it so far, and it gives me a natural look. * Great product * When i first used this i was stunned by how much i loved it! It looked so skin like, it was very hydrating and wore wonderfully, but when i washed it off at the end of the day i saw all fungal acne it gave me on my forehead and around my mouth. Im sure this is beautiful on more mature skin, but if youre acne prone steer clear. * Ive always loved makeup, a full face. But when my skin starts to flake and my foundation is dry, i hate it. I wanted to stop wearing makeup completely until i tried this product. She's perfect!! No seperating, doesnt dry me out, she's flawless for 9+ hours. (I have always skin prepped so that wasnt my issue) i set with the laura m ultra blurring translucent power, chefs kiss. If you have dry skin, this product is game changing."

(Use the pur brush as well) * holy grail foundation, i will never but another again üòçüòçüòçüòç * I've tried many foundations and have had incredible difficulty finding one that matched my skin tone (pale neutral) and didn't oxidize.  This foundation is perfection (shade LN2).  The color stays true and doesn't oxidize throughout the day as so many foundations have done on my skin.

It has a natural finish, sits very smoothly on and blends easily into my combination skin without emphasizing dry patches, lines, or pores.  My skin is fairly reactive, and I've had no negative reactions to this foundation.  The coverage is buildable and so good that I no longer have to wear concealer.  I've found that using a setting powder does help it wear throughout the day, but it's still nice even without.  I hope PUR continues to make this foundation forever! * also love it because shade TN3 is a perfect color match for my skin tone. * The foundation is reliable and my go to. Whenever I try to use other foundations, I just come back to this one. * It was such a match i loved it definitely buy again- made me look flawless on my pictures * I love how when you unscrew the bottle there is an applicator wand and I can use it as a concealer. I love that it's customizable with coverage. I can go very sheer and light or I can go glam. 
It also has a built-in primer and infused with skincare. It's a win-win. Please use the brush that is recommended for this product. It gives a absolutely beautiful finish."

Love how light it feels last all day no touch ups! And no creasing. * Conceals and blurs my dark spots and redness! Doesnt make me break out. Makes my skin look natural and healthy. I wear a hydrating Lorac primer underneath. I apply with my hands. Takes about 45 seconds to apply. Doesnt sit in my fine lines. Can sometimes cling to extremely dry patches but it doesnt cling nearly as bad as 99% of othef products ive tried! * I've tried to like this foundation like 3 times now i keep returning it and then seeing a good review and then buying it again hoping it'll work but it clings to every dry spot even with skin prep and primer thats just me though. * Oily skin girls definitely buy it. Leaves the skin very pretty and mattified. With little product it covers a lot and lasts all day. I have oily skin and the makeup was perfect throughout the day. * The formula looks dry and sits in the fine lines upon application. By the latter part of the day it looked slick and oily in the cheek, jaw, nose and brow areas thus looking uneven in coverage.  Primer and a setting spray were used. * I'm a big fan of it cosmetics from their regular cc cream to the glowing cc cream and their dark spot concealer. I have oily skin so I decided to try this matte version. It was the worst decision I've made!! Every time using it, it leaves my skin looking patchy and cakey. I've tried everything by mixing it with moisturizer or oil, layering extra moisturizer before applying it, but nothing worked‚Ä¶ On the same day I tested my new lancome foundation and it just performed so much better on my skin. Unfortunately, I'll have to toss this out. Total waste of money!! * This make up is not goof for older looking skin.  .  It is very matte and does not feel like it had any moisture .  Reviews said it was matte but made skin look moisturized.  Not on me.  I bought the It Bye Bye Foundation and like it much better."

Its so natural, it looks like skin & makes me so so glowy!! The only thing i dont like about this product is the pump, you cant control how much pumps out so it can be a lot when you only need a little, but the pump itself doesnt get messy at all. 

I would recommend you buy this product! * Absolutely perfect! This was the first foundation I've ever purchased and I won't try another brand now. You can't feel it on your face, similar to a tinted moisturizer. Also great shade matches as someone who is pretty pale. Definitely would recommend and repurchase! * I bought two bottles, two different shades.
Both pumps do not pump. I have to open the pump to use it, and it gets messy!
The liquid is runny and accumulates all over the bottle.
The foundation itself is very smooth going on, and lasts all day.  It does seem to hydrate the skin.
The price can't be beat, a few more shade choices for light-medium without a yellow base would be good, and unless the two bottles I bought with the pumps that don't work were an exception, this can be a really good find. * Good foundation for those with dry to normal skin. It blends into my natural skin tone despite worrying it was too light. Great coverage and builds well. Would buy again * I was pretty excited to try this, the shade is right, the price is great.. goes on smooth and easy, it held up 8-9 hours‚Ä¶ but when I washed my face, my skin was dry, like a dry I've never felt before. My face felt rough, I applied 2 rounds of moisturizer and my skin was still gasping for moisture‚Ä¶ I had to apply more moisturizer to get my skin to feel somewhat moisturized * This is a beautiful foundation. I have tried pretty much every foundation out there, from high end to drugstore and this us one of my favorites and one I will repurchase over and over. The finish is beautiful and it lasts all day without drying me out. Sometimes i mix this with the Filter Effect foundation from Morphe and it comes out amazing. Try this! * This stuff really covers!

This might be my 4th repurchase since I've been using it for years. It blends out really nicely and is a perfect shade match!! Haven't found anything as good. * This foundation is an absolute staple! This might be my 4th repurchase since I've been using it for years. It blends out really nicely and is a perfect shade match!! Haven't found anything as good. * I have pretty normal skin. Not dry, not oily. I have a few small visible capillaries on my cheeks and chin. The color match was too light but I had already put primer on so I wasnt going to start over. I put my ""summer"" setting powder on top to counter the lightness. I can honestly say, my cheap Maybelline foundation works better and lasts longer (all day!) than this one. I'm glad I only purchased the mini even though it was double the price of my usual foundation. * Love the coverage and how it feels on my face * Not as bad as some of the other brands but overall not good if you have dry skin. Patchy * Great product, I use just a small amount to cover my whole face, my skin feels like silk after applying it. I totally recommend it as your everyday foundation. Didn't work on me going to the gym and sweat."

The smell was absolutely terrible, I found the coverage to be uneven, and after an hour or so of wear, I looked in the mirror and it really exaggerated my fine lines and pores. I for sure would not recommend this foundation to anybody over the age of 35. * This is a no for me. It smells terrible and does not work on my skin. Exaggerates dry spots, separates in oily areas, and looks cakey with any amount of product. I've tried applying with fingers, brushes, and sponges. I'm really disappointed I spent so much on it. Drugstore foundations are much better quality than this one! * This is a difficult foundation to work with, the coverage never looks even to me and it's not buildable. up close, I can see it pills on my skin if I pass the sponge over it more than a couple of times. cream products don't layer over it well - it's hard to blend cream blush, bronzer and highlighter on top and it transfers and moves all over the face. It doesn't really set down, even with powder. I have dry skin and never have issues with uneven coverage or getting a foundation to set down, with or without setting powder. I'm just not a fan, I have wet n wild, Catrice, urban decay and Pat McGrath foundations that all perform better across the cost spectrum. * This a wonderful foundation. It gives perfect coverage, making my skin look dewy and fresh.   The best part is that it is a clean product, without the bad stuff.I love this brand. * Not enough coverage for my aging skin! * Unsure. It's not like it's a bad product. I feel it's good quality. I think maybe for a lighter foundation could be a good find. I feel for the price, what my expectations were; not a good buy necessarily. Fell a bit flat for me. I've also only used a couple (2-3) times. Maybe it grows. My skin feels nice.
I don't feel excited afterwords-if that makes sense? Sometimes I put on foundation and I'm like ""OO-Hello there!"" I put this on and feel like‚Ä¶ehh. Best way I can put it. I did have a more positive prospective when adding a glow enhancer. It's ok."

My favorite thing about this product is that I can build it to my liking without it looking caked. * It was the perfect last step for my make up.

And our d has plummeted. Oral D, no good. Sun is above us for a reason, a VITAL reason. * I love the coverage and it's very easy to apply.

Then I noticed it was smearing, bronzer and blush disappeared. Definitely not transfer resistant and lasts maybe 4 hours before it falls apart. Not worth the price performs way worse than $8 drug store foundation * It doesn't help that the person at Ulta was convinced that my skin is more pink than it actually is... So the color is wrong, but the formula is bad. Every fine line is made more visible and it looks rough. * this is advertised as a serum foundation, but it's really not. it does not however feel heavy on the face, but if you're looking for light coverage this is not for you! recommend for oily skin, it is matte and dries down kinda quick so move fast! oxidizes kinda bad so be mindful of that with shade selection! overall beautiful foundation, looks very pretty and lasts a long time! as a makeup collector its for sure a 10/10 * Trust me when I say I have tried this product so many times, I mean it. I saw so many good reviews and decided to buy it. The first time the color oxide so bad, it left me red and orange by 3 shades darker, not impressed I decided to color exchange. Even then it's too dark, so I go 2 shades darker, and I finally have somewhat of a good color match. But despite the color match, the wear is terrible. I tried primer, no primer, moisturizer, no moisturizer, almost every single possible match, and it does not work. It left my skin so textured and patchy, it shocked me. I'm very much an Estee Lauder girl because she leaves me silky yet matte. But unfortunately this foundation did not cut it, and I really wanted to like it. * Loved the coverage and how long it lasted. However I was orange by the end of the day. It oxidized rather quickly. It's unfortunate because it really lasted all day in a kitchen without making me shiny. * even with a good skin care routine, i still have those days where i break out from time to time. This foundation blurs out my breakouts PERFECTLY, giving me smooth skin as long as i set with powder. Literally my holy grail."

Cons: Smell * Goes on easy can be a little oxydizing. Need fo moisterize well before. Overall not bad. Great shade options.

The shades are different, more yellow-toned. It looks bad immediately upon application, and does not last throughtout the day. I have used the original formula for years, it was my favorite foundation. I will not continue using it with this new formula. Please bring the old foundation back. * Very close to the Armani foundation. Absolutely love- the only thing is it separates in my nose bc of my glasses."

I've tried sooo many other foundations like fenty, hause labs, makeup forever, and too faced and always went back to eeste lauder even though it emphasized my skin texture. I love this foundation! It melts into the skin, has a beautiful finish, and is buildable. It's what I wanted hause labs to be except it's not super oily. When combined with the setting powder it looks like a real life filter. * I'm over 50 and this is the best foundation I've tried so far.

I am so lucky I found this since I was using another even pricier foundation. If you have drier skin, or skin that is combination, and if you have rosacea like I do, this is excellent. It covers and still provides some sense of your own clean, natural skin in areas where you don't have the redness. It moisturizes enough to spread well and to stay on the whole day without creasing. * I love Clique  makeup. I have used it for many years. * I've been using for a year with no complaints. Great full coverage I only have to apply once and my acne scars are covered. I work in a humid environment and my makeup stays put all day and I don't use a setting spray or primer. My skin is oily combination. * I love Clinique and its my life long go-to. I usually use their stay matte foundation. This formulas shade is completely different than most of their other formulas. It looks a little more 2004 Dream matte mouse than the other ones üò±üôÅ Its giving Oompa Loompa and Its more expensive than other Clinique foundations so just don't waste your time or money. * chose linen 08 which w a s supposed to be cool/neutral. it's so yellow. also it is very full coverage but that's in the description, just made an assumption it would be lighter coverage because of other serum foundations I've tried - not a bad thing just FYI * This is a beautiful foundation.

I apply it with a brush, and it is like swiping an airbrush filter over my face and feels like nothing is on!  I would say the finish is 'soft matte' - it takes down shine and doesn't look dry, cakey, or flat.  Very easy to work with and pretty amazing results.  I travelled with it recently, and it very travel-friendly - doesn't seems fragile and is just so darn easy, fast, and fuss-free to apply (no extra setting powder needed).  Because it is lighter coverage (light-to-medium coverage) than other options, I have slotted this as a go-to everyday or light-makeup-day foundation.  The color match for me is spot-on as well - I got 'R4' which blends to my skin color/tone as well as my favorite reference shade, which is Estee Lauder Double Wear in 2C3 Fresco. * I usually wear liquid products but decided to get a powder for the summer and thought it try this. I used the find my shade feature and it ended up being the perfect match!! It looks amazing on and very natural. I also have very sensitive skin and I have no reaction after applying. Highly recommend to try!! * This is, by far, one of the best powder foundations I have ever purchased. There are so many shades to choose from, and the associate who took the time to help me find the best match, was excellent. The coverage is buildable, and it wears very well and does not settle into fine lines. Highly recommended! * Great for aging skin, doesn't settle, crease. Goes on smooth, light coverage (buildable). I love it, all DM is amazing, everything I've tried‚ù£Ô∏èüë±üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è * I've always been a little hesitant with powder foundations. For reference I have combo skin (oily t-zone, dry elsewhere), and this looks beautiful on both skin concern areas! It doesn't catch onto dry patches and melts well into my oily areas. A slight complaint is the amount of kick-back the powder produces in the compact, so it can be a little messy, but it's really not a big deal. * I  asked an Ulta sales woman to help me cover  my red peeling skin 7 days after a microneedling  appointment. She used an IT makeup brush and miraculously this  glam facial foundation completely beautifully professional coverage.
This foundation is light, and doesn't feel like I had a makeup on. This was surprisingly as I have dry skin.
Expensive, but well worth buying. * I have never really used powdered foundation until finding out about Natasha Denona's. As a fan of her eyeshadow, concealer, blush and eyeliners... I was amazed! 

It gives a nice natural coverage that is somewhat luminous. I will say, if you have enlarged pores or fine lines, you may have to find yourself reapplying to those areas. It did not accentuate your pores, but if you struggle with that area I would recommend a primer, as it didn't cover them up completely. It is great for covering redness, dullness and uneven skin tone! 

Personally after a 12 hour night shift of wearing this foundation, I would say it transferred minimally without a primer or setting powder. I used the elf power grip setting spray, and it helped seal the foundation better. 
It's super easy to blend contour, blush, bronzer and highlighter on top of this! 

I would give this a 94% satisfaction rate and recommend it to those with more normal, sensitive, combo or even oily skin types."

The lightest shade gets darker over time with use and it isnt light enough to begin with. I have to mix it with a ligint concealer for it to work. Also the packaging is a bit awkward and does speed up the oxydation * Very good tinted foundation. * I've ditched the high end brands. This is my nee go to. This doesnt cake or get patchy.

I have oily/combo acne prone skin and works well with my skin, it isnt full coverage but you can build it up decently! * I have been using L'or√©al makeup up base for many years and this formula has been great for my aging skin.

Everyone i recommend this foundation to is hooked!!! 
Not sure why people don't like it but if youre looking for a foundation that will last and get your moneys worth, this js it! * Updating my review! I spoke too soon. This foundation is horrible and is the first makeup that I have ever returned. It transfers so easily, I would find it smeared on my phone. Using without the CT Hollywood filter, the is texture is awful and it only lasts a few hours.  Save your money and go with another foundation. * Really high quality, longwearing foundation. Makes my 60-sometjing skin look lawless all day. Must prep skin thoughly with moisturizer beforehand but really top notch. * I love it! I've tried so many other products. But this is actually full coverage. It matches my skin and lasts all day. It's pricey but worth it. * Just to clarify, I did not get this product for free so my review is not biased. I've tried Laura Geller, Clinique, KVD, Il Makiage, etc., and I believe my search is over now that I have found Charlotte Tilbury's Airbrush Flawless. For those having problems with it looking cakey, the most important thing to remember is skin prep ... make sure you use a good cleanser, toner, serum and moisturizer prior to your foundation always. It took me awhile to really accept how important skin prep is but it is so true! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this foundation! It truly does look flawless. My very unobservant husband even commented on my makeup the first time I used this foundation ... he said my skin had a beautiful and healthy glow.
Thank you Charlotte Tilbury! * Has beautiful coverage especially for those that have acne scarring and redness like myself! I didnt get oily all day and wasnt transfering off. * A little definitely goes a long way with this product coverage-wise but it left my makeup with an odd texture and a matte finish (in a bad way) that tended to look cakey even with just a small amount of foundation. The color 3C also didn't match the 3C from my tube of Charlotte's Beautiful Skin Foundation. Not the worst foundation I've ever tried but not worth keeping. Returned."

I really wish i could love it, but it doesnt last. I tried wearing it for a day, but within an hour my face started to get very oily and itchy. The product does its job to orovide coverage, but it didnt help with the shine. I looked loke i was sweating after a while and my undereyes look very cakey. * So I turned 40 and needed a new foundation.  Luckily ulta helped me out. Not normally what I go to but I love it, it's sheer but has coverage and doesn't settle into fine lines. Only thing I dislike it it feels a bit oily to me, but I've worn matte makeup my whole life * I'm a combo/oily gal. I liked that this claimed to improve bare skin and had heard great things about it cosmetics. it went on nicely, but by the 2nd hour this made me look like a grease ball, accentuated texture that wasn't quite there to begin with, and felt slimy. not for me and I would not repurchase. the shade was fine, just didn't care for the product itself. * I've tried many foundations over the years and this one is my absolute favorite! It's so easy to blend, leaves a beautiful skin like finish and lasts all day. I haven't gone back to any other foundations, this is my tried and true * There were things I liked about this foundation-the skincare benefits, the light feel and look after initial application BUT, it was watery so it sunk into my pores and emphasized the texture of my skin horribly. It also had zero staying power. It was usually breaking up or worn off within three or four hours but still managed to remain lodged in my pores further emphasizing them. If you aren't worried about pores and skin texture you might want to try this but it did not work for my more mature skin. * This is by far my favorite foundation. It is a perfect color match and provides a beautiful finish to my skin. It is natural looking on the skin and doesn't settle in lines. * This is one of the besy foundations i hsve used!  It covers really well without being or feeling heavy!   Looks beautiful on!!!! Love love love it!  Im 51!  Wears all dsy!"

Then I add the Amazonian Tarte Blurring powder that helps hide the wrinkles under my eyes. * I've enjoyed using this product for several years but noticed the spf protection was no longer a feature. It wasn't easy to find a matching shade as my color was discontinued. Even worse, the new formulation has a heavy odor and made my skin burn. I'm not happy and will need to return it. * This is the worst foundation that I have ever used. Don't even waste your money on it. * I am 40 and have spent my entire life looking for a foundation I loved. I have hyperpigmentation, so needed coverage, I can't do serums or oily/creamy blends because they don't blend well with wrinkles, and I wanted it to last all day. This one surprised me and has checked every box. I blend with a kabuka brush and it covers beautifully and it seriously lasts all day. Love it. * If you're feeling like your skin looks especially youthful for your age, this foundation will humble you.  Even with the face tape primer and highly moisturized skin, this foundation reveals fine lines, wrinkles, and textures you didn't know you had. Within minutes of application it settles into every single wrinkle, pore, and dry patch, accentuating lines and textures and making them look massive.  The coverage is very full, but it's extremely thick and cakey.  And yet somehow when it settles, it still allows red patches and imperfections to show through.  I actually do like the smell, and the matte finish feels soft and velvety to the touch, but it looks terrible. Ages me by at least 10 years. * I had seen this foundation sometime ago, I have oily, mature skin with multiple issues; acne dark spots, sun damage, and now in my later years melasma, I didn't try it because of the price. I tried several drugstore brands, and wasn't satisfied mainly because of the coverage. Ulta's 21 Days of Beauty reduced the price by 50%. I tried several on in the store and bought 3 shades to see what really suits me. At this point I'm testing, but I have to say the coverage is amazing! * Cost is definitely too much given it's performance."

I've tried cleaning it out several times with towels, qtips, etc. and it seems to just get worse and worse. If you lose the product due to a faulty dispenser, what good is the money spent? * This foundation is incredible. Its completely natural looking whole still providing perfect coverage. It is my absolute favorite and a new staple.

The one thing that's tough for me is the pump. It stopped working notmally halfway through the bottle. It makes it so hard to yse and i hope they fix this in the future. * I was pleasantly surprised how moisturizing this foundation is. Feels like creamy lotion going on but not heavy or sticky. Wears well and looks dewy, doesn't seem to settle in fine lines. * I had high hopes.  The formula feels nice and the color was right, but that was it.  Looked good when I  first applied.  Looked in the mirror about 6 hours later and it had oxidized, worn off (didn't touch my face all day), had patchy spots , and settled big time in my pores.  By the way, I work from home on a computer all day, so wasn't even outside.  Quite possibly the worst foundation I've ever used.  Don't waste your money. * Excellent &  hydrating my new fave product * This foundation is SO overhyped. In the details of the foundation, it says oil control! What a joke! This is the most greasy feeling and oily foundation I have ever used. It transfers even with the laura mercier powder, breaks down within an hour, and has barely any coverage. But then somehow also clings to the very few dry patches I have AND enhances every wrinkle I have. Horrible!"

I love it. * Full coverage cc cream w spf. What else can u ask for?! * I have been using this product for years and I loved that the majority of the ingredients were safe and/or natural.  Now, dimethicone (silicone) is the second ingredient and most of the rest are synthetic chemicals and now it smells like chemicals.

The size of the tube is smaller than it used to be, and the new ingredients are much less expensive than the original formulation, so the price no longer reflects the quality and quantity.

Very disappointed in the changes. * This foundation works real well in being full coverage with not much product. It doesn't take much at all and it doesn't cake on my skin like other foundations I have used in the past. I love how it has a nice finish that isn't matte. Blends well too. I love this product! * I have never written a review, so I hope this helps someone. I'm 40 with oily skin. I've tried everything on the market as far as matte foundation. Fenty, Clinique, luminess, IL makiage‚Ä¶. You name it. THIS foundation is everything I need it to be. Run, don't walk if you are considering this foundation. * I am very happy with this product as it is excellent for a more mature women's skin.

And i know as a tinted moisturizer there wont be much coverage but this is zero. And its so streaky, wont blend or build, makes me look greasy. The setting powder from this brand was life changing and i wont use another, but this moisturizer gotta go unfortunately * Let's be clear, this is a tinted sunscreen. It felt thick and cakey on my skin yet there was no coverage. Also made my skin looks super greasy. * I tried Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and foundation for about 6 months (way too long). This makeup completely wrecked my skin. I've never had a major issue with acne or clogged pores until I used this crap.  (I moved shortly before switching products and thought it was a mix of a dryer climate and hard water that was making my skin look awful). It's been 9 days since I stopped using this brand/products and it's crazy how much better my skin looks and feels. * For starters, this product is perfect for those ""no makeup"" look days! I wore this, went to a water park for 5 hours, and my face didnt get sunburned! * Love this moisturizer. Feels light and gives the perfect amount of color and a smooth look. * I asked the clerk for medium coverage. This product barely provides any coverage, It is just tinted moisturizer. * I love this tinted moisturizer and I recommend it for people with normal or dry skin. My only problem I had was that it looked a bit orange but once I put it on and spread it out it was perfect. Really good for the no makeup makeup look that's popular currently and for a quick everyday style."

The color match was perfect! * I have no idea how Mac cosmetics doesn't get the hype it deserves. This foundation is stunning. You don't need a lot to look your best. Covers up my rosacea with one layer. And the slight, makes your face look bright all day. I am a Mac lover from the 90s. This is one of their best products so far. * This stuff has broken me out so bad. Mac discontinued my go to foundation i have been using for over 5 years. Guess ill try another brand.. i do not recommend this at all. From no acne to about 15 pimples just from using this. Color is also way off from other products in mac line. Way more orange and dark than expected. * I tried this before it was part of the 31 days of beauty to make sure it was what I wanted. I love the coverage and the perfect match to my skin tone. I am older, so I was concerned it would settle into my skin and cause lines, and it does not. Its very nice and I like that it has good ingredients that help your skin. * I am generally a MAC stan. I love the majority of the products I've tried from them, so I was hopeful. It look a bit of work to blend, but whatever. Was tacky afterward, but I always set with their Skinfinish powder before going in with other products. I set with powder twice and spray once. If ANYTHING touched my face, my foundation wiped off with it. Had a tear from laughing? The entire inner corner sections of my eyes were bare. I've had to fix my foundation four times today, which is highly unusual. Will definitely be returning. This formulation did me dirty. * Was struggling to find the perfect foundation for working in an office setting. This is so lightweight and really does make my skin glow. Beware of a tiny bit of patchiness but other than that, its great. * I really wanted to love this product and it is a no from me. I have worked really hard to get my skin to where it is at and it broke me out so bad. I have had my acne under control and when I used this product I started breaking out like crazy! Also, the color match is way off. I was so disappointed as I use the mac foundation and I wanted to try this one as the formula seems lighter and more comfortable to wear. I wanted something for a more natural look and it did the opposite. It ruined my skin!"

The top doesnt come off so s we hen pump cant reach the priductvtherecis no way to access it. Very wasteful. * Ever since Mac reformulated their studio fix fluid, I'd been on a deep search for something that even came close. I had tried so many different brands to no avail, and was about at the point of giving up when I decided to give the Chanel Ultra Le Teint a try. Thank GOD I DID! This makeup is absolutely amazing and I like it even better than the old studio fix fluid! It glides on super smooth. Contains ingredients that make my skin moisturized and subtle. It does not oxidize at all and looks even better as the day goes on! The color you see is the color you get. Doesn't separate or get cakey. Doesn't settle into fine lines. Doesn't break me out. Doesn't make me oily and doesn't slide off. I feel absolutely gorgeous in this and my husband just can't take his eyes off of me wearing this. Yay! I'm so happy and I hope Chanel keeps making this one. * I've tried many foundations on the market (ELDW, Dior, Mac, etc) and this one is definitely the best for combo skin! You don't need much, yet it covers fairly well with a damp beauty blender. Feels like you're wearing nothing at all, and looks like skin vs looking like you're wearing a mask. Went for a power walk in 80 degree weather (after using setting powder on top) and there was no sweat or oil that broke through at all! The smell is quite strong but smells like perfume. I have sensitive skin yet my skin did not react to this scented foundation. It is well worth the money!! * This makeup wears so well even when outside all day. I love that it doesn't transfer when I blot my face. * This is a great foundation that offers medium coverage, long wear and a soft matte finish. I have been using it since Perfection Lumiere was discontinued in the USA around 2019. Le Teint is similar but less heavy.  I went hiking in summer and it stayed on. It does not dry out my skin. For reference, I have light olive skin and use ELDW 3N1. Chanel's shade range spans from light to dark in 3 undertones: Beige Rose (BR), Beige Dor√© (BD), and Beige (B).  I tried all three undertones in the light-to-medium range and settled on B30, a neutral. I set it with Chanel's loose powder #3. It doesn't burn, sting, itch, or cause break outs. I've tried other brands that irritated me after a couple of weeks. When I return to this, my skin heals and remains clear. * I ordered the B20 shade, described as a neutral undertone. as soon as I put it on, it was orange, and not for pale skin. I had to return it and was unable to exchange it for the right color because Ulta doesn't carry Chanel in store * Other department stores sell just as good coverage through meeting or cover girl this is 10 times those prices"

My skin looks incredible with it on and it applies so nicely, very light but great coverage! I dont even wear concealer with it! I put on a light moisturizer (I use Caudalie vinoperfect) and then apply the foundation with a brush. 5 stars!!! * This may be the worst foundation I've ever tried; I could not get this to apply correctly-i tried a brush, sponge and my fingers-there was just no applying this stuff.

This is hands down my favorite foundation for longwear or when I want a more full makeup look (wouldn't wear this to the gym or errands). I always get compliments, tip- don't use primers or too much product beforehand. This finish is sp amazing. I buy a darker shade to counter...so easy. * I absolutely love this foundation stick. It goes on smoothly and stays all day long. It is medium coverage, but looks very lightweight and natural. I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and i have had no issues with this at all (which is a first!). It is probably $5-$10 over-priced and is also a pretty small quantity, but it is worth it as long as you aren't using it constantly. If you were, you would run out quite quickly and it just wouldn't be ant bang for your buck. * Easy, long wearing application with a natural finish.  I use a darker color as contour. * I knew I would like this product because its Lancome and they rarely if ever do anything poorly, but WOW!!! I loved this stuff!!!! It is so creamy, smooth, easily blended and has multi different uses from concealer to highlighter to all over foundation.  The formula is to die for.  I don't know how they did it but am in love! * I was honestly let down by this product. I went with a foundation stick for fuller coverage and this one has the same amount of coverage as the drugstore NYX liquid foundation. I will say that it does hold up very well and doesn't seperate or look bad after a fee hours but the coverage was not giving what was supposed to be gave.üòñ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

I tried this new teint idole and it is awful. It's a wierd cobstiency and cakey and a total waste of $60+. Customer care also didnt offer to do anything about it. * I bought the foundation in store. I got home found it was expired and returned to a different store for replacement. All of the ones in my shade were expired. The employees were very polite and placed a replacement order. That order arrived Tuesday and was again expired. I contacted Ulta for another replacement which has yet to be processed or shipped with no guarantee that it won't be expired. Check your expiration dates to make sure you aren't paying full price for expired make up and wasting time and gas. * This is THE BEST FOUNDATION I've ever had, and over many years, I have tried just about all of them. An experienced manager at Ulta in Holyoke, 
MA with her knowledge and experience recommended it and tried it on me and it made me look flawless and natural and made my skin look better! Very highly recommend this foundation! * Its super greasy and makes me sweat alot ! I really dont like it * I love how this foundation looks on me. I was so happy when I found such a great match to my skin. It looks fabulous and natural. It makes my face look smooth and soft, I wish I could have found it sooner, but thanks to a kind person /patient worker I'm happy . * I thought I'd switch from the matte version to this, thinking it would be better. Nope. I feel like this is sucking the moisture out of my skin and just makes it look dry and cakey. There's no building of coverage and forget using a foundation brush, as it makes it look worse. Others have mentioned that there is alcohol in it, which would make sense as to the way it makes my face feel. No matter the amount of skin prep I do, it just doesn't look good. I'm 38 and this is causing breakouts, which I never thought I would have a problem with at my age.

Sadly, I am still on the hunt for a good foundation that will stay during my 10-12 hour shifts. * I have combination skin and most foundations get really oily on me unless i use 2 primers and 2 setting sprays. This foundation was pretty matte on my skin even with no primer or setting spray, so I wouldn't call it hydrating but I'm not complaining.

I liked the color match, but it offers almost no coverage. Not good if you have hyperpigmentation, dark circles under your eyes, etc.

But this is still a good every day makeup. It looks very natural, good for errands and casual hangouts. Not an event makeup IMO."

I would love if they had more yellow / golden tones but thats just me being picky, im happy i dont have to mix 2 together for my shade. I love the finish of this foundation even when i wear it on its own for a clean girl beat and when im being extra and go FULL beat. To me it feels like a doupe of haus labs, the price is PERFECT! Yes the applicator sucks but thats truly the only thing bad about this foundation. My shade is MD3Warm * I found the foundation to settle into my fine lines and be patchy. Especially as i wore it throughout the day. There are cheaper drug store brand foundations i found to be better. 
Also, this is the worst applicator for any makeup ive came across yet * I was really excited to try this foundation, as the reviews looked good. I got it during the 21 days of beauty, so I thankfully got it at a discount. It is more of a skin-tint than a foundation: when I went to blend it in, it more or less disappeared on my skin. It takes a lot of product to get any kind of coverage, which is also frustrating since this has a doe foot applicator, and is very difficult to get product off of. It wears well and holds up throughout the day, but I quickly found that this was causing breakouts all over my face (only thing that was different in my routine). I always double cleanse to remove my makeup at night too, so the fact that it still did that is honestly kind of impressive in the worst way. * I bought the shade LM2 neutral and I found it to be quite yellow, not neutral at all. I liked how it applied, in that it felt nice and lightweight. However, after wearing it for a few hours, I could see it separating and getting patchy on my face. I have combination skin but on the less oily parts of my face is where it was more noticeable. I do not recommend this product. * The only good part was the color matched, which is hard for my pale skin. It is very thin and within an hour I felt so super greasy. I couldn't wait to get home to remove. It also would wipe right off with the slightest touch on my face. * I have very oily, fair-light, olive-undertoned skin with some redness in the center of my face, and hyperpigmentation spots scattered here and there. This foundation cuts the redness, minimizes the hyperpigmentation, and gives me a lovely, smoother texture that looks like my-skin-but-better ‚Äî neither overly matte, nor super dewy, and yes MEDIUM coverage, not full. F2 Olive gives me the absolute best shade match I've ever had in my life! I think this foundation actually might decrease my oil production a little, since I only have to blot once some days and not until the afternoon. It wears beautifully over the course of my whole day (including both indoor and sweaty outdoor activities); it doesn't seem to cake or flake (as long as I haven't tried to use like 5 layers), so if it does wear off in places, it's very subtle. I use water-based primers so I can't comment on whether it works with silicone-based ""blurring"" primers. Before trying this foundation, I was using a blend of 4 different foundations to approximate my ""perfect"" foundation. This single foundation is way more affordable, easier, and a better color match! I love it so much! (Oh and the applicator? Not a problem if you pull it out gently and slowly, and kind of tilt the wand to the side as the doe foot comes through the seal. I love being able to apply it with the ease of a concealer!) * love the inclusiveness of olive tones, it's just not found for fair skin types. I loved this foundation u til it broke me out like crazy. I'm talking huge pimples all over the face."

I prepped my skin and used different primers and everytime this product sticks to every dry patch or highlights pores and its got a sticky cake like consistency. I cannot believe how awful it is. I get better coverage and finish from drug store brands. This is not worth it and I wont be buying it again or any of the others * I wanted to love this and I do!  It really does give a great finish on the skin. It is buildable without looking cakey. It is bit on the expensive side but I feel it is worth it for sure. * Looks pretty but very thick can clog pores. Can be a little drying. * This foundation has been a constant on my vanity for a long time now, and it is one of two foundations I use.  This foundation is a hybrid of skincare and makeup and delivers both beautifully!  The formula is a bit thicker as it is a very hydrating formula, but it feels like a soothing hug on the skin!  I notice with this product in particular it seems to sink into the skin as well as snooth itself on top, as to give the skin a snoother appearence wherever texture may be present, which for  many people with some texture such as myself this is a great callout.  I also use my hands to apply my foundation so I cannot say if a brush or sponge would change how it dries down, but it seems to both become one with the skin as well as sit on top slightly. I also have pretty rosy cheeks naturally and I have noticed this product will sooth and calm redness and in my case, no color corrector has ever been needed!  I just love this foundation and hope that this review helps someone trying to decide if its the right one for them!  I highly reccommend at least trying it out or checking out a swatch next time you come accross a tester! * It's very light weight, did return because the color was not a fit for me * I saw all the hype on TikTok about this foundation.  It does not last more than four hours in the Texas heat.  It was a greasy mess.  It smeared, my mascara was even smeared because of this foundation.  It was all over the collar of my shirt.  If I touched my face, the foundation would transfer to my fingers.  There are much better options.  Lesson learned don't listen to ""beauty influencers"" on TT. * i bought this product because it claims to hydrating. not only did it enhance my dry patches, but made them worse throughout the day."

It smells amazing, has the SPF and stays on matte. I live in AZ where if is hot and this does not feel heavy or cakey. * I decided to try this foundation after seeing reviews on YouTube. But it does not live up to the reviews. It is not transfer proof, and it rubs off so easily. If you touch your face, it's smearing. I may have to go back to bare minerals. * The foundation itself is great. It goes on smooth and it last long it is not greasy or oily. The pump keeps clogging, every few days when I dispense it shoots out at angles, it gets on my clothes, and I have to change last minute. It gets on the wall‚Ä¶ its very frustrating. It is good make up, but if I am spending this much money, the packaging should be good too. * This foundation seriously changed the game for me. I have a hormonal IUD and have been on meds to correct the skin issues it has given me, and this has done wonders for controlling oil! I use the Laura Mercier Blurring Primer and this stuff, and I will never use anything else. I manage a drive-thru coffee shop so I see quite a few people daily and I get at LEAST 5-10 compliments a day on my make-up! Its worth it to have to make sure my pump is clean so it doesn't rogue squirt * The best foundation perfect match and stays on all day. * Bought this product long ago and whenever i sweat too much or my face gets oily this foundation just dissapears.. (primer elf power grip) but it makes my skin look so textured and my skin doesnt even look that textured üò≠! but it never caused me breakouts!! * The foundation is fine, I would not buy it unless it's on sale because the coverage and longevity doesn't hold a candle to other lower price point foundations like Too Faced. That being said, the bottle pump is the worst, the hole is so small that it dries after each use even with the cap on. When you go to use it it squirts out everywhere and I mean everywhere. My white walls have been stained from this foundation and I have ruined several of my tops that even soaking in the most pitent stain removers will not touch. Do better Dior, this bottle is garbage and I have never had this issue with a foundation bottle."

This foundation goes on beautifully, covers my redness, blurs my pores and wears nicely all day! Plus the shade I picked up (Alabaster) is perfect for my light cool toned skin. Love it! * I struggle with acne in my mid 30s and even before that I couldn't find a good foundation that truly lasted all day and looked so smooth. I got this for free when I became diamond so I figured if it sucked I wasnt out anything‚Äî- and it turned out to be lifechanging. The coverage is so perfect, it is so smoothing and looks so good! It doesn't melt in heat and helps not give me anymore acne. It also works great with all my other blushes, bronzer, etc. Ive already purchased another because i dont ever want to run out! * It is so light and not oily like other brands i have try. * Nice coverage, light weight, doesn't feel or look like you have foundation on. * I have had acne for most my life from teens to my 30's. I use heavier foundation for special occasion, but not regularly because it makes me beak out. I also have oily skin

I love this foundation for everyday use. It blends well and makes my skin look clear. Since using it, i have been getting many compliments regarding my skin, they cant tell i have foundation on. It also helps my acne and i don't break out 

I use a beauty blender to apply and finish with transluscent powder to stay in place and give matte finish

It made me break out after a few days. It won't wear long, after a few hours it'll start to separate and look super splotchy. Won't be repurchasing. * I love this stick, I am quite pale with neutral to cool undertones and this looks quite natural on me. I personally prefer to blend with my fingers to help the product melt into my skin, I have drier skin and with a primer it doesn't settle into fine lines or cling to drier areas like around the nose * I love applying this product however it's not a good pick if you plan to wear it all day. I am a night nurse so I want my foundation to look nice 14+ hours. Even with Fenty's setting powder and spray I can't get this to wear long. I do enjoy this for running errands or short excursions. * Fenty  foundation stick convenient, goes on smooth * I love the finish but it turns orange :( 
Shade 16, my brightening concealer doesn't balance out the oxidation either but it's a good formula. Gonna try and use a blue concealer to cancel out the orange and hope it works. I do like the Anastasia Balm with the Fenty hydrating concealer and Fenty matte powder foundation together though. * This unfortunately doesnt sink into your skin at all. It wipes off extremely easy. I tried everything, i even bought the hydra moisturizer from fenty that's recommended before using this. Still no luck. I also used a brush and sponge. It matched great but oddly sits on top of my skin * I wanted to love this product so much, but it's not great at all. I have to say, it was the oerfect color match for my skin color; First of all, for the price I was expecting much more product. Second, although it glides on very nicely it does not look  like it attaches to my skin whatsoever. The foundation looks like a film on top of my skin. I tried applying it with a brush and with a sponge; it looked the same both ways. Third, it looked streaky. Overall, I'm very disappointed with this product."

The only thing that can go wrong is that a little bit goes a very very long way. Also, the packaging is not the best because when it is opened and closed a lot of the product spills out. Other than that, the formula and product itself is great and has a good finish. * The coverage this foundation has is immaculate! I love the dewey finish it gives me and how it is easily moveable and blendable. The bottle is very sleek and beautiful which is a plus! I definitely recommend this foundation! * I find it very hard to find a contour color that is not super orange in red this is just a straight dark pigment that makes chiseled jawbones amd snatched noses. Very pigmented a little bit goes very long way. I really want to try as an overall foundation I just gotta get the right color * The coverage was medium to light. Definitely an everyday wear. Complemented my skin tone very well. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it held up during a hot day. I've been wearing it pretty much all summer now, and I just love how well and easily I can apply and make it work with my any makeup look. * Long lasting foundation. The under tones makes me wish I got a bit of a darker color. It goes on & blends out easily. When I dries down it gives skin. You get a lot of product for the price. * The coverage is light, but very vibrant! And I don't get that ashy gray look after you apply  like other foundations. I love the subtle scent as well. The product comes in a pump bottle, and not a lot comes out--if you apply with the T line method, the pump is good. Application is easy, and I like to use the Fenty foundation brush with it for a nice and even blend."

When I first apply it, it looks like nothing, but as you blend it into the skin you can see a visible evening of skin tone and a glowy hydration. It is comfortable to wear. It does not feel cakey or heavy. I can wear it on my undereyes set with an undereye powder, and set everywhere else with a loose powder. I typically prep my skin with a toner (Glow Recipe) and my moisturizer  (Beekman 1802) and do not otherwise prime my skin, but I may change that routine as winter approaches. One of my favorite base products ever! * I am really liking this skin tint. It's a bit thicker than other skin tints I use but very hydrating & smoothing. I just buff it a bit with a brush so it feels a bit lighter. The shade finder quiz makes it easy to choose your match too! * The skin tint is very nice. The coverage is great. I love the formula of this tint. The tint makes my skin look glowy and healthy. It blends wonderfully and lasts all day long on my face definitely recommend * I really enjoyed this skin tint. I like how it doesn't feel heavy on the skin. As someone with dry skin, this skin tint feels very hydrating and makes my skin look very dewy and glowy. I'd assume that it's definitely a staple product for those colder winter months. It never looks cakey and always sets so beautifully. * This skin tint is a summer favorite! As someone that likes something super lightweight for the summer this has easily become such a staple! It's super lightweight on the skin and has a natural finish! I like that it has a bit glow to the skin and does not feel heavy! It blends out effortlessly into the skin and has a your skin hit better effect! * The #17 shade is a bit darker on my skin but one thing I love about it is the fact that it looks so flawless on my skin. I applied it on my skin and it gave me a flawless finish. The only downside was that it is so hot in Florida right now to the extent that some of it melted off. Do not wear in scorching heat. However, I highly recommend this tint. It gives a flawless effect * The Veil Hydrating Skin Tint is a standout foundation that combines seamless coverage with hydration. Its lightweight texture blends effortlessly into the skin, giving a natural, dewy finish that feels comfortable all day. One of the highlights of this product is how easy it is to find your perfect shade online, thanks to the extensive range of shades available. Whether you're looking for subtle enhancement or a more polished look, this foundation delivers with its skin-loving formula and flawless blendability."

It works perfect with my light olive skin and now I'm a true believer that im actually an olive with out doubt. Normally I have to buy a neutral leaning cool shade. I still will have to buy neutral leaning cool after this is gone because Ulta now only shows 32 shades out of the 33 shades that were there.  Filter Light 4 as of today is no longer listed on Ulta's website. It not even listed as out of stock just gone. The numbers go from Light 1,2,3, and 5 for example.  Such a bummer. Not sure if i can check the Morphe website but I only bought one botttel of this to test and see if it would work and it does perfectly. * My go-to foundation. I love the way it makes my skin look. * It goes on smoothly and has nice coverag * I have tried alot of foundations over the years  and this is hands down one of the best ones I've tried. It blends great and covers fantastic. It also dorsnt break the bank and lasts all day. This is going to be my go to from now on. * I love the way it looks on my face. Not too thick. I like matte because I have the t-zone sine and this product works great for me * This has been the best makeup foundation I ever used!!! * I have very oily and large pore skin so most foundations tend to melt off or settle into my pores which this one doesnt seem to do so. It can be hard to blend if you put your foundation sparingly at first. One thing i do not like is the smell. It has a weird smell to it and im not sure if maybe i got a bad batch? it goes away after a while and usually im not too sensitive about fragrance but I've never had a foundation smell so strong before from what i can remember. The shades are nice and i got mine in Light 4. It helps hydrate my dehydrated oily skin and any oil that comes through gives me a soft glow. I do like it and would recommend it."

Ive tried the chanel foundation & hated how textured my skin looked but this beats it by 100000üòÆ‚Äçüí® * I really liked this foundation at first but once it dries up you can't blend it out anymore. If you mess up your makeup during the day, you can't fix it because it will just rub off and not blend well. Terrible!!! * Please don't waste your money. I had high hopes for this foundation after urban decay discontinued the all matter foundation you pay such a big prize for very cheap ingredients. If you have sensitive skin be careful because this has alcohol in it and you can definitely feel it and smell it. This foundation also has other ingredients that are banned in other countries so when it advertises as clean ingredients, that's absolutely false. The coverage is OK. It can get very drying you definitely need to moisturize very very well before applying this foundation unfortunately I have tried other more affordable foundations that have done a better job and have better ingredients. Don't waste your time. If you are conscious about the ingredients you put on your face. * Bring back the All Nighter foundation! * One of the best foundation i have ever use!!! * This is my new holy grail of foundation. I have a super oily T zone and struggled to find a new foundation that would last all day after the KVD lock it foundation got discontinued. This foundation lasts ALL DAY and does not slide around. I set it with powder and only need to reapply a little powder on days that I'm super oily. It does not tranfer at all and is also totally waterproof. I was skeptical when I first bought it but now it is a must have for me!"

So I always use powder foundation. The reason I LOVE this foundations are 1) long lasting wear 2) doesn't look cakey at all 3) but still has great coverage without looking heavy 4) color matches my skin tone very well. I have tried from cheap to high end ones and I say this is one of the best. I have one more favorite but I'm keeping it as my beauty secret! * I'm in my late 30s and was looking for a powder that wouldn't sink into my fine lines, and lasted. This was not it. The coverage is too transparent, so you have to use a lot of get better coverage, and then it doesn't have any staying power. Maybe it's my skin or my primer that doesn't work well with it, but for the price I wasn't impressed. * I have used PUR Cosmetics pressed powder foundation for 5+ years, but it has retinol in it and I'm pregnant. I tried several other brands of powder foundations (Bare Minerals, Lancome, Maybelline) and they all looked so patchy, cakey, and horrible. I tried this as a last-ditch effort, and I'm so glad I did! This is a fantastic pressed powder foundation. It applies easily, doesn't look patchy, doesn't look cakey, doesn't settle into my fine lines, and provides decent light/medium coverage. This has a very nice semi-matte finish, and looks very natural on the skin with a feather-light texture. I will say PUR's product offers a little more coverage in my opinion, but this product is still amazing. I love the ingredients, and I love the refillable compact concept. I highly recommend this! I have combination, acne prone skin and this did not cause breakouts for me. * I originally purchased the kit on the JE website, then came back to Ulta.com to get my refill. This is the only foundation I've ever actually used up!!! I have rosacea and wear glasses, so my tzone does get shiny and requires a small touchup at midday. Some tips:
-use a primer of some kind, either Jane's or another that you like.
-get a retractable travel brush (I use the one from Eco Tools) this is great for touchups and when I need more coverage, I twist the brush only halfway (making it denser) which gives more coverage for my cheeks because I have rosacea. If you need heavy coverage, you are going to want a dense brush to sort of pack it on in downward patting strokes. 
DO NOT swirl/buff...this is not the other mineral powder. different formulas work differently. 
¬† * This perfectly matches my skin tone. It's very difficult to see when I swab it on my face to see the color.  Nothing  else has ever matched like this. I have been using it for about 8 years. I have normal to dry skin and this gives a natural look. * Initially I didn't like this powder. Was accustomed to fuller coverage powder foundations and i think the shade i chose was a bit light. Decided to use it as a setting powder over a tinted moisturizer because i had a sample of a good tinted moisturizer i wanted to try. I really only wanted to use it up so my money wasn't wasted. This is where i fell in love. It's very good at blurring and I found that it was better than the 100 different setting powders I'd used. I'm a little surprised about the reviews that mentioned cracking because this is the ONLY powder I've ever had in 35 years (in my 50s) that i used completely. Even the little edges stayed in place until they were completely gone. Weird. I can only guess it's because i never bought the hard case to put it in because I initially didn't love it. It stayed in the plastic refill case until ENTIRELY gone. * It does not cover like I'd hoped. I do like the way it goes on with a brush and feels like nothing on my skin. I think the color match is good. But for the price I'm looking for something else that covers my red spots and little veins better."

The color match was beautiful, but the TRANSFER! I have tried every primer, powder  and setting spray but this transfers on everything. And the smell is odd. * I wanted to love this foundation because I heard so many great things about it but I had to wash it off after 10 minutes because I had an allergic reaction to the fragrance in it. * Product is definitely very hydrating but it oxidizes after a while. * Matches my skin tone perfect feels and looks great my favorite foundation * Ive used pretty much every foundation out there and I have to say this one is # 1 !!!!! Best coverage, color match and longevity. Love everything about it. * its not a full coverage foundation * I have tried many foundations and this will always be my go to.

I found the coverage to be very buildable so I could get a full if I wanted to! It is a luminous finish so I powder the areas that I need to. I also didn't find it to be too heavy and I got a lot of compliments on my skin. * Im 46 so wrinkles and pores is a thing. This foundation works better than my maybelline skin tint, Lanc√¥me ultra wear, elf satin & camo, misha bb cream. Its very skin like but w/ coverage, doesnt settle in lines, erases pores! Wears all day, i lightly set it w/ elf radiance setting powder & lovk it in w/ elfs glycerin setting spray, chefs kiss its so pretty on my skin. If it gets shiny throughout the day maybe 1/2 during a 12 hr shift i lightly pat it w/ hourglass new compact powder trust me you wont regret especially mature ladies. * I love this product. It is gorgeous on the skin. I'm oily and it still looks great. Good price on it. * I love the way this looks on my skin. Very hydrating and Dewey. Great for mature skin. * Ive tried this foundation and it looks cakey and crumbled like chalk almost and i do not have dry skin. This was a waste of money for me. * i've always had a really hard time finding foundation that works with my skin. i've tried probably a dozen brands and most of them make my skin look dry and flaky on top of not quite matching my skin tone. decided to give this one a shot and it's almost a perfect match for my skin tone plus it blends so well into my skin. no more flaky, cakey looking mess on my face! the coverage is a little bit light but does the job * I love everything about this foundation!  It goes on smoothly‚Ä¶. no sliding around or creeping into any creases. Color was spot on!  I've used Rodan & Fields for a few years but this foundation beats it all the way.

I was looking for a lightweight foundation with a dewy finish, and was directed to the Tarte representative. She did a fantastic job helping me select the right shade (in the natural light by the window). I can't say enough good things about this foundation. The first day I wore it, my friends commented how glowing my skin looked! It's not too heavy, and I love how it feels on my skin. I'm now a Tarte foundation convert! * I think this is my new Holy grail. Great coverage and great application. * I found a great color natch with 22 Light Sand, which as a fair warm olive it can be difficult to find such a good match. It was perfect coverage. A solid medium coverage. It didnt settle into my smile lines, which is a recurring problem for me at 38yo. I did set this with the lightest amount of translucent pressed powder, enough to set down the tackiness, but it stayed dewy looking while not being sticky all day. I'm a fan! * Absolutely love this foundation! Suitable option as a skin tint or buildable foundation coverage. The formula is immaculate! Glowy and radiant finish, leaving my skin feeling smooth & natural. * I have super sensitive skin that reacts very badly to most cosmetics, even the very high end ones. I had been using Lanc√¥me tient idole but they change the formula and I had a nasty reaction. For those of you with sensitive skin like mine, you know how bad it can be as you try to cool the rash and it often times takes days. But I read the reviews about this product and thought I would give it a try. i've been really happy with the results. As one reviewer mentioned you have to shake, shake, shake the bottle to mix the formula. Also, you need only a very small amount. I use my fingers to dab it on them. Blend it with a sponge. I don't need much and it provides lovely coverage and leaves my face feeling fresh all day. If you put on too much, it will feel tacky. But if you use a light hand, I think you will be thrilled. are used the shade match that is on the Ulta app and got a perfect match. I highly recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to many of the products out there.. * My all time favorite light-medium foundation. Matches my skin perfectly and looks very natural. Been using since it came out originally. LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Cant say enough about it. Holds up to heat and humidity and never settles into fine lines"

My skin is sensitive to many products but this was one has not caused any unusal breakouts. This product is moisturizing without feeling heavy. It provides moderrate coverage and looks natural! I have definitely received positive skin comments wearing this stuff! I definitely intend on continuing to purchase this moisturizer! * Got this in a subscription box, but i will repurchase it. I love the finish on this on my dry, aging skin. It does need to be set with a powder or will remain a little tacky, but afterwards it looks gorgeous. * Light and covers good * Product feels light with some light tint coverage as well. * when i say run dont walk ‚Ä¶ i truly mean it ‚Ä¶ 
i dont usually do reviews but i am obsessed with this tint . i threw away all my foundation. . . 
dewy perfection. * this is one of the best skin tints that offers great flawless coverage!! your face just glows and looks like your skin but better. it's a must have. it does transfer to fingers if you touch your face. use with a great setting spray and if you wear contacts avoid the eye area. I use estee lauder this skin brightening serum is right there with double wear. Definitely a must try. * This may be the worst face profuct ive used in forever. Even with my favorite primer and setting spray, this is so oily. It seperates in a very odd way that i am not used to. You can see every imperfection amplified due to the weird texture. It leaves you with lines and pores you did not even know you had."

This new formula is definitely not even close to the original (color, coverage, wear, etc.) and not in a good way. * I can't believe they ruined the foundation I've been wearing for years. It's horrible. The colors have all changed, so I had to return for a different shade. Then after wearing the new shade for a few hours, I realized it's a completely different formula. It oxidizes and it gets blotchy and dry and cakey. It's so awful! Bring the old one back! I'm switching brands now. Never thought that would happen. * MAC, we had a good thing going. This used to be my ride or die. I heard the formula changed. I sampled it. NW13 is now fluorescent orange and it looks terrible. Bye. * This stuff works really good. * 2 star for the shade match (nw10) but this doesn't deserve the other 3 stars. This feels really greasy and heavy on my face even if I only use up to 3 pumps. Also burns a bit because it is heavily fragranced and clogs my pores. I woke up with a big zit on my jawline after wearing this a few days ago too. Don't recommend for sensitive and acne prone skin that gets oily. Fail. * I was so sad to find out that they changed the formula. I find that the appliaction is not as smooth and starts to crease immediately regradless of how you set it. The finish of the foundation is more dewy and I get shinier much faster throughout the day. * I just purchased this brand for the first time.I was using another brand but it wasn't keeping my extremely oily skin at bay. I decided to give this a whirl. I am so surprised that it is a true matte foundation. Coverage is great medium to full. It goes on smooth and the color matches perfectly.My skin does not get slick like with other brands. I have mature skin (51 y/o) and want a foundation to cover blemishes or dark spots. This will do it!  I highly recommend if you have a problem with foundations on oily skin!"

Im getting this for myself. * Its a good powder, maybe a little cakey if you apply to much. Unfortunately, like many other people, the product shatters after a fee uses * I was so excited to find an affordable option to the Lanc√¥me face powder buuuut I blinked and this compact was in PIECES. I was so confused how the heck that even happened. I came to the reviews and realized it was not just me! Such a bummer. It did give nice coverage for the 2 days it was not shattered.

I'll just spend the extra on my Lanc√¥me one. * Never looks cakey, the shade range is great, doesnt make my dry skin look dry, perfect coverage * It's such a bad product. I have oily skin. First of all, it doesn't blend. I tried it with a brush, I tried it with a pad, sponge It doesn't stay on my face, It gives a cakey look * I have gone through few of these bc I like the finish it gives but I can never end up finishing the entire product without the products breaking in to a million pieces and spilling everywhere. Even if I am extremely careful with it the product cracks and then crumbles. I even tried to repair the product and it was a solid piece for maybe 2 days before it cracked again."

Very very lightweight with barely any coverage. A slight hint of tint, not sticky.  It did feel nice on the skin. I use it as a base to start, which I never do.  Other less expensive lumi products, that can be worn alone are better for me. * A tinted water gel that can give you a glass skin look (at least it did for me). For it to work for you, you need to have good skin. In French culture (since this is Chanel), skin care comes first and makeup enhance the beauty. This is exactly what this product is about. If you are looking for coverage, then this is not the product for you. But if you are looking for no-makeup-makeup, then this is it. * This stuff is magic. It's super low coverage and leightweight, yet somehow makes a huge impact on the look and feel of my skin. I have late 30's normal-to-dehydrated fair skin with plenty of freckles and hyperpigmentation. This plumps my skin like crazy, the tiny tint is somehow enough to tone down redness and the finish is flawless, like a filter without looking makeup-y. It's totally undetectable and just looks like you're having a great skin day. Seriously magic and I'm pumped that Ulta now carries it, because it's not cheap and Ulta's rewards are SO much better than any other retailer. I have only two criticisms of this product: it is fragranced with the classic Chanel scent, and the packaging is massive for the volume of product you get. Not at all travel friendly. So when I travel, I bring the complexion touch product, which is very similar but slightly more pigmented. Comes in much more reasonable packaging and is unscented. I do like this product better than the complexion touch, however. Something about it just looks more magical on my skin. It has become my all-time favorite holy grail base product. * Foundations were looking quite funky on my 40-year-old skin and I was needing some thing that mesh well with my new aging skin, and this is absolutely it. It doesn't settle in cracks/crevaces wears beautifully. * I will start by saying that I DESPISE the feeling of foundation. I use to wear full coverage foundation on a daily basis and then stopped for about 2-3 years. This water tint re-introduced me to the foundation world. It's so breathable on my skin and TRULY has the no makeup look (this is my preference). If you're wanting something that's full coverage for blemishes then I wouldn't choose this product. If 
you need it for evening out your skin tone, covering redness, and just overall looking a little more put together lol, then this is the stuff! I apply it with my fingers. I do a cream blush before I apply to have a nice glow peaking through the foundation. Just set it with a translucent powder and ta-daa! * I just tried the Chanel Les Beiges Water-Fresh Tint, and it's amazing! I usually don't wear makeup, but when I do, I keep it minimal with just blush and mascara. Every cosmetic product I've tried in the past felt heavy and uncomfortable. I've been searching for something light that enhances my skin without weighing it down, especially for special occasions and date nights. The Chanel Les Beiges Water-Fresh Tint is a game changer for me. The texture is incredibly light and refreshing, giving my skin a natural, dewy finish that feels like a second skin. The micro-droplet formula blends effortlessly and gives me a radiant, healthy glow without feeling heavy or cakey. It's perfect for achieving a no-makeup makeup look. I highly recommend this luxurious tint for anyone who wants to achieve a flawless, natural look. Five stars all the way!

I've uploaded a photo that I took about an hour after applying. I used no brushes or sponges when applying this. I blended the micro-droplets between my fingers and applied it like a moisturizer. I am honestly shocked at how incredible this product is. The fact that I put no effort into applying it, yet it somehow still turned out flawless, has blown my mind! I can't wait to see how incredible it looks and feels after prepping my skin and applying it with a brush and beauty blender. * I don't normally leave reviews but I absolutely love the product. I was a little hesitant because its a little pricey but its worth it! The color I received was a medium light. At first it looked extremely dark but once I tried it on my face the color blended right in. Its a light coverage which was exactly what I was looking for. I mostly want it to cover the redness I naturally have in my skin and it does just that. I love the product and I would definitely recommend."

It looks like my skin but better, very hydrating and the coverage is buildable . Ive been using this for years haven't found anything else like it. * I don't write reviews often but this makeup is awful! it applied nice at first but after a few hours it looked horrible, cakes, separating and completely drying to my already dry skin. I wouldn't recommend this foundation to anyone. * I had this brand and shade of foundation applied as a makeup demo and have have used it ever since. I love the coverage and the color which compliments my skin. * I love this foundation. It matches my skin tone perfectly. I have alot if red in my face due to flushing from an illness I have and it covers it up perfectly. I would recommend this product to anyone. It stays put after it's on so you don't have to reapply. * The ranges of darker colors is lacking. The deepest shade was too deep. The shade up, the color i got, oxides to a flat muddy brown. Disappointing, I knew Clinique to have a better selection of deep shades with note complexity. Additionally, this foundation pills when i add a powder on top. * Feels good on skin, clean and no cracks * I have used Clinique make-up and skin care for a long time. This is the worst foundation I've ever used. It made my skin look 10 years older and settled majorly into fine lines.  I seriously looked like a clown!

however
-it is expensive
-only sells in red or yellow undertone which means u NEED to buy two and mix 

so even though this is literally the best foundation its cery expensive and the shade range is annoying

now in terms of transfer, if u have a good setting powder and a good fixing spray i dint see why this would happen vut i also dont gave oily skin so maybe thats the big determining factor * Love this makeup and all producthe maker. maker. * it doesn't oxidize so that's cool but it slides right off after a few hours and gets all patchey and cakey. I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for anything long lasting or sweat resistant :( * Love this product * In all my 45 years of life this foundation is the best one ever. It is smooth to apply and easy to use, and perfect for any occasion. It's my go to product. * I was so afraid to try this for so long because the reviews are so polarizing and I have oily acne-prone skin, but I'm so glad I bit the bullet because this is now my favorite foundation. I also use the Danessa Myricks balm foundation, which seems to be similarly picky in terms of requiring a well-moisturized base and using really small amounts of the product. As long as I do that, it produces a long-lasting, incredibly skinlike finish. The only drawback for me compared to the DM balm is that this one does not take mixing well, so I have to apply any glow products directly to my face prior, instead of mixing them together on my hand. * I applied a little bit of this in the morning with a loosely packed brush (swirling it around for even coverage) and the coverage was great! Felt like nothing on my skin. I powdered it down, and went about my long day. 12 hours later (and after sweating a ton) i still had coverage. It had definitely faded a bit by then, but i was impressed. Definitelt not transfer proof, but I havent found a foundation that doesnt transfer. Def powder down."

It's my go to! Age 45! * If you have dry skin and wants to try different look, then you will find it in Chanel Healthy Glow. Use a sponge/beauty blender to use it as a tinted moisturizer; use a brush for heavier coverage; if you want an airbrush look, add powder. This is perfect for all year long. My holy grail! * I have never been able to wear liquid foundations because they have all been either too yellow or too pink. B00 is PERFECT for anyone who is neutral cool. I have super sensitive and dry skin and I tried this on a whim to see how it would up‚Ä¶ I didn't use a primer and it it lasted all day through work without touch-ups. all I used to set was the benefit setting spray and a setting powder. 

PERFECTION * obsessed! * I am convinced that this stuff having as high of a rating as it does is some kind of psychological thing where people subconsciously think it's better than it is because it's Chanel. The shade is fine, but the product never feels like it has actually blended into your skin. It feels like a wet glaze sitting on your face. It therefore runs right off, no matter how much setting spray you use, as soon as you go outside, engage in any sort of activity, or sweat. * This is so worth the money. I've always used Mac since I ever started using makeup but wanted something a little lighter for everyday now in the corporate world but good quality. Now that i'm 29 I'm happy to splurge for quality especially if i'm giving a 16hr days a week. This is worth every penny for newly growing mature skin. * This is the prettiest foundation I've ever put on! It is very natural looking, glowy, and breathable. It doesnt change colors or cake the longer you wear it. It looks the same all night and wears comfortably. It gives light to medium coverage which is my preference in a foundation. Also, although the price tag is steep, I am able to do my full face with a small dot on my beauty blender so I am hopeful that I will be able to make a single bottle last for a while!"

(Use the pur brush as well) * holy grail foundation, i will never but another again üòçüòçüòçüòç * I've tried many foundations and have had incredible difficulty finding one that matched my skin tone (pale neutral) and didn't oxidize.  This foundation is perfection (shade LN2).  The color stays true and doesn't oxidize throughout the day as so many foundations have done on my skin.

It has a natural finish, sits very smoothly on and blends easily into my combination skin without emphasizing dry patches, lines, or pores.  My skin is fairly reactive, and I've had no negative reactions to this foundation.  The coverage is buildable and so good that I no longer have to wear concealer.  I've found that using a setting powder does help it wear throughout the day, but it's still nice even without.  I hope PUR continues to make this foundation forever! * also love it because shade TN3 is a perfect color match for my skin tone. * The foundation is reliable and my go to. Whenever I try to use other foundations, I just come back to this one. * It was such a match i loved it definitely buy again- made me look flawless on my pictures * I love how when you unscrew the bottle there is an applicator wand and I can use it as a concealer. I love that it's customizable with coverage. I can go very sheer and light or I can go glam. 
It also has a built-in primer and infused with skincare. It's a win-win. Please use the brush that is recommended for this product. It gives a absolutely beautiful finish."

It is a beautiful lightweight, hydrating formula that can be built up to the coverage you want. It doesnt cake and has a stunning finish. * I absolutely hated this foundation, I really wanted to like it but I applied it with my fingers and my face would feel and look oily. I personally have combination oily skin. I even tried using a primer and the same thing happened. very disappointed * I have combo skin and if i don't prep my skin properly this foundation can be drying. Ive learned that if i mix gobi and Salzburg i get my perfect shade. I prep my skin w rhode glazing milk and elf hydra grip primer and i use a beauty blender to apply i use nars creamy concealer under my eyes and kosas concealer for spot concealing around my face. I set it w kosas powder in tzone and use the Nars light reflecting setting spray. This makes my makeup flawless and last 8 plus hours even my tzone, i'm a hairstylist and this holds even through blow drying hair all day. This routine does not break me out at all, which is crazy because my skin is sensitive and breaks out easily so i can't use anything w fragrance on my face, which non of these products have. My skin is also sensitive to too much Niacidamide which seems to be in everything these days except this (thank goodness) * For the cost ..I would like to have been better instructions. * Where has this foundation been?? I just saw an article raving about this and I went out to see about the hype and glad I did!, makes skin look flawless.... AMAZING * I have uneven, pigmented, textured, older skin and most foundations aren't great on me. This foundation doesn't lift up flaky areas like some serum foundations do. It provides coverage, but isn't mask-like. It does have that light reflecting property that makes my skin look better than it is.  I apply it with a damp Beauty Blender and it lasts all day. It sets up to a very comfortable, nonsticky finish in about five minutes. It's not tricky to apply. And it feels good on my sensitive skin and is weightless. I don't see myself changing foundations. This Nars Light Reflecting is my soulmate. * at 43 I need hydration, medium coverage  and something lightweight! this checks those boxes for me!  doesn't break up , crease or sperate! I think it wears great all day but I also use a griping primer that adds to the longevity!!   

typically I wear skin tints in the hotter months and light to medium coverage rest of the year this feels like a tint but covers like a heavier base! I'm here for it!!"

Love this product. * Used la roche tinted sunscreen instead. 42 was too dark on me. Will be returning * I bought this on a whim just to try, and I was pleasantly surprised! The first time I tried it I was in a rush, so I actually used my fingers to apply it! The coverage was matte, and smooth! It covered up all my redness in one smooth pass! I love the flawless, light coverage. It's perfect for those no makeup makeup days! I am a mom, so some days I don't have a lot of time to get ready and this gives me that sense of security. I'm definitely impressed with this foundation. The price can be a little bit hefty, but that's what comes with a luxury product!

It was a perfect match for me and it really looks like my skin but better. It hides the general redness of my skin but still allows for my freckles to pop through which really makes it feel more natural. It doesn't even look or feel makeupy to me. It leaves behind a natural finish with a subtle glow, but not glittery or even shimmery. It's kind of magical. It really is a new favorite! Smashbox was not even on my radar! * I was genuinely impressed with this tinted moisturizer. It provided the perfect amount of sheer coverage, which I prefer for everyday wear. I'm particularly pleased that it includes SPF, which is a fantastic bonus. The finish is like a light dew, giving my skin a healthy and radiant glow without appearing overly dewy. It's incredibly lightweight and fragrance-free, which I find refreshing. I highly recommend this product. * I was pleasantly surprised by this. It goes on almost like a foundation but goes into the skin so smoothly and softly. It's not heavy at all and this color was a perfect match for my skin. It also greatly helped my redness. I do have combo skin so I felt a little oilier than normal at the end of the day. However, overall it is amazing! * This gives great coverage. You can see in the picture I provided as it goes on as I am only wearing this tinted moisturizer. For my oily skin, this did not last all. It made it to maybe lunch. I also wish it had more SPF as I need 25 coverage. I do like to put it on with tinted lip balm and a swipe of eye shadow for a low key night look. * This product has a medium buildable coverage which is good for an every day makeup look. The finish is natural and  glowy. The product itself is not long lasting though. * This tinted moisturizer is amazing!!! I love that it very light and the coverage is great. The packaging is super cute and I will definitely be purchasing! * I recently tried the Smashbox Halo Glow Tinted Moisturizer, and I'm thoroughly impressed! The texture is lightweight and blends seamlessly into the skin, providing a natural, dewy finish that brightens my complexion without feeling heavy.

The coverage is perfect for everyday wear‚Äîjust enough to even out my skin tone while still allowing my freckles to peek through. I love how it hydrates my skin throughout the day without making it oily. Plus, the added SPF is a fantastic bonus for sun protection.

The packaging is sleek and travel-friendly, making it easy to toss in my bag. Overall, this tinted moisturizer has quickly become a staple in my makeup routine. If you're looking for a product that offers a fresh, radiant look while keeping your skin hydrated, I highly recommend giving this a try!"

I've tried everything to get it to stay. It settles into fine lines making them appear bigger, loss cakey, seperates, and feels disgusting.  0 stars if I could. * I love this foundaton !!! I was hesitant at first since i rarely wore make up and got it to wear for my sisters wedding but i got loads of compliments and the shade matched my skin perfectly and i didnt look like a cheeto ! * I loved the color and feel and was excited about the skin benefits. However, after each time Ive worn it Ive broken out the next day. I have always had sensitive skin, but Im also in my late 30's and hardly ever break our or have a skin blemish so unfortunately Im sure it was this product that caused it. * The foundation is really good for mature dry skin. The pump is horrible it broke after the 2nd or 3rd use * Definitely love this product. I recommend to everyone!! * I'm very oily and I've stuck with my eeste lauder double wear for years. I've tried sooo many other foundations like fenty, hause labs, makeup forever, and too faced and always went back to eeste lauder even though it emphasized my skin texture. I love this foundation! It melts into the skin, has a beautiful finish, and is buildable. It's what I wanted hause labs to be except it's not super oily. When combined with the setting powder it looks like a real life filter. * I'm over 50 and this is the best foundation I've tried so far. Non drying, doesnt cake, buildable  coverage but the pump on the bottle broke after a week and the shape of the bottle makes it hard to get the product out."

Its very light/ sheer coverage. This claims to last 12 hrs or so. I was excited because it seems like it has great benefits and added sunscreen. At the end of the day, it was def oily and I needed face powder. I have a clear face with no acne problems, but after a day of use this caused pustules on my skin! So upset by this cause I wasnt breaking out before.. I wanted to love this product but it completely missed the mark. * it was very oily.    Would like very much to be refunded * Dewy and radiant buildable coverage. Glides on easily even over dry and patchy skin. Does not settle into fine lines.  Once set with powder it and stays put, in dry or humidity climate. Feels light, true with the serum claim. Has added skin protection and benefits. Did not irritate my sensitive complextion. The 0 and 1 colors matched well on my  pale neutral skin tone. * This color was a perfect match for my skin tone, which isn't always easy to find. I liked that it had spf just to up my coverage in the summer. However it has a thick and sticky texture that is hard to apply. I tried using my fingers without success coverage was splotchy and showed a lot of texture. Same problem when applying with a brush. Better coverage, but the coverage broke up halfway theough the day, additionally the texture was awful. I dont have any acne scarring or fine lines or wrinkles where texture was visible. * This is a great lightweight serum foundation for the skin just not for those who wants a natural matte look. I have oily to dry skin. I never realized i had dry patches until I used this product. It applied beautifully but within the hour i noticed it cling and accentuate dry patches. * I recently left Estee Lauder and tried a few other makeup brands, but this serum pulled me back. Im so happy i got this! It is perfect! Good coverage but light too! You wont be disappointed! I an 56 and this is great for my imperfections! * My skin has changed so much in my 40's and an Ester Lauder/Ulta rep tried this on me and all I could say was wow. Very luminous. The rep used a dry sponge but at home I use a wet sponge and it glides on and really improves the look of my skin."

Its so natural, it looks like skin & makes me so so glowy!! The only thing i dont like about this product is the pump, you cant control how much pumps out so it can be a lot when you only need a little, but the pump itself doesnt get messy at all. 

I would recommend you buy this product! * Absolutely perfect! This was the first foundation I've ever purchased and I won't try another brand now. You can't feel it on your face, similar to a tinted moisturizer. Also great shade matches as someone who is pretty pale. Definitely would recommend and repurchase! * I bought two bottles, two different shades.
Both pumps do not pump. I have to open the pump to use it, and it gets messy!
The liquid is runny and accumulates all over the bottle.
The foundation itself is very smooth going on, and lasts all day.  It does seem to hydrate the skin.
The price can't be beat, a few more shade choices for light-medium without a yellow base would be good, and unless the two bottles I bought with the pumps that don't work were an exception, this can be a really good find. * Good foundation for those with dry to normal skin. It blends into my natural skin tone despite worrying it was too light. Great coverage and builds well. Would buy again * I was pretty excited to try this, the shade is right, the price is great.. goes on smooth and easy, it held up 8-9 hours‚Ä¶ but when I washed my face, my skin was dry, like a dry I've never felt before. My face felt rough, I applied 2 rounds of moisturizer and my skin was still gasping for moisture‚Ä¶ I had to apply more moisturizer to get my skin to feel somewhat moisturized * This is a beautiful foundation. I have tried pretty much every foundation out there, from high end to drugstore and this us one of my favorites and one I will repurchase over and over. The finish is beautiful and it lasts all day without drying me out. Sometimes i mix this with the Filter Effect foundation from Morphe and it comes out amazing. Try this! * This stuff really covers! I use my hands to blend, then a brush, THEN a sponge for any excess. Hydrating, a little glowy, def needs to be set but i set everything. Would recommend!!"

I bought this because I was on the hunt for something that would be lighter and not melt off my face in a gross cakey way in the heat, and this is it!! I wish I tried it sooner!! * As a very oily girl, i hate to say but i am disappointed. The doible wear is great for oily skin but i needed something light coverage and matte at the same time. I needed something to wear to work everyday. Unfortunately, my oily skin pertruded after a two hours snd i had to pat down my skin. So i recommend if you have you combo skin but for oily skin not necessarily. * I'm on the fence. Love the finish very natural. Doesn't settle in lines and wrinkles. Very runny and thin seems to take a lot of product to produce a full face coverage.  My 70yo skin on nose is breaking out a bit and this is only new product I am using so I'm just not sure  will keep trying * I really enjoy using this foundation. It is so lightweight, a perfect color match, and wears nicely throughout the day. It doesnt get overly oily/shiny in my T-zone where I experience that the most. Minimal setting into my fine lines and wrinkles - even less when I prep with a primer. 

I highly recommend! * I have dry skin and the regular estee lauder foundation wasnt for me. However, this one worked well. It's lightweight and still covers the small red and dark spots but I would not recommend it to someone looking for a full coverage. * For reference, I have fair warm toned, moderately oily skin. I usually wear 1.05 in Smashbox Studio Skin, and NC15 in MAC Waterweight. I wear 1n2 Ecru in this foundation. I love love this foundation. It is beautiful on, smooth, light coverage. I don't have a lot of dark spots or acne issues. I do have freckles and some redness, but not crazy. This coverage is perfect for me for daily wear. It plays with my other products. I don't get weird grainy break down around my nose, chin, and under my glasses at the bridge of my nose like I do with other foundations. It will last my 16 hour day and still look great, no fading or disappearing act. If you need full coverage, you can skip this one but if you just need an even out with a natural look, this is your girl. I thought Fenty EZ Dropz were the best thing ever until I tried this foundation, and now I won't touch the EZ Dropz again. * I go to a huge college in the South where it is often above 100 degrees outside, and I will wear this to football games and sit out in the direct sunlight and sweat for hours and it still looks just as good post game as when I put it on! I love this product and swear by it! It is expensive but I think it is worth the price. My only complaint is that I think they could give you a little more product for the price point, but the product itself is just so great I won't stop buying it!"

However its kind of thick and can cause breakouts. Its also easily transferable. Must use a setting powder or spray if you dont want it getting on anything. I do still love the coverage though.  Needs more shade options too * Ive used a few tinted moisturizers (morphe and milk) and I would consider this as a foundation thats medium coverage. This is comparable to Born This Way original but lighter. I have been loyal to Born This Way Matte since it came out since its more bulletproof than the original formula but I always loved how the original finishes on my face - it just doesnt last as long. However, this is just like the original and is my new go to! It lasts just as long as the Matte but finishes like the BTW original. * this is my all time favorite. I have combination skin so I usually have problems with foundation separating or drying out my skin not this one it looks perfect for hours including Mt best friends outdoor wedding in south louisiana in August. I was sweating bullets and it stayed perfect all night 10000/10 * I have dry skin that's not sensitive at all. I put this on and my face started itching shortly after applying it. The finish isn't as good as my tarte bb cream but it isn't bad. This isn't quite as builda le as I'd of wantedit but unfortunately I'm taking it back. * This is the best tinted moisturizer ive found and ive tried a lot. I've been using it for several months. It's medium coverage and can be built up. It blurs my pores and has a dewy finish. My skin looks great and its not cakey at all. I use a beauty blender to apply it. It doesn't take much product as a little goes a long way. If you're looking for medium coverage, dewy finish and blurring effect, give this a try. * I bought this formula when it released in 2021 and i LOVED IT. I mean, i absolutely adored this foundation. It made my skin look flawless. I like to try new foundations so i didnt buy it for a few years til April 2024. That tube was fantastic. My aunt said my skin looked flawless & that i should never stray asay from this foundation bc it looked great on me. Well i bought a new tube in July and i got a different shade bc i had developed some color from summer sun. Well this new tube is GARBAGE. I absolutely hate it. It looks awful on me. Idk what is going on but i will not be repuraching because i dont like inconsistency with my makeup. * Finally! < angles singing> A lightweight tint that hydrates, covers and doesn't look like makeup!!! All without caking, creasing or accentuating dry patches. It takes about 60 seconds to set and lasts all day. I do wish that there were additional shades, especially for cool shades. Orange and peach are warm shades, so a truer cool shade would be heavenly.  Thst said, I'll be repurchasing."

It looks great and preforms well with any skincare I've ever worn underneath, including different sunscreens. (PSA - this has SPF but shouldn't be relied upon as your only SPF in a day.) Looks great. The color range seems completely constant across the brand. So if you started with the Doublewear Stay in Place and were looking for something lighter and more natural finish, you can choose your ""usual"" shade. * I have worn the double wear sheer foundation in dessert beige for years. They changed it so much; it is hardly the same foundation now. The double wear in full coverage is too much for aging skin (I find). I looked at the serum tint and it was clearly too oily for me and too sheer. The hydra rescue, on the other hand, is the new deal. A lot of sun protection, just enough coverage. And most importantly I finally matched the color the right way and that is to my neck. Turns out I was never desert beige, I am exactly Ecru. Who knew! It can look flaky if you don't have a moisturized enough base. Also, start with a smaller amount, then build up coverage as needed to avoid caking. Other than that, it stays on and does not easily transfer. * I love the formula. It's highly pigmented so a thin layer is plenty, you don't feel like you're wearing anything. The only problem is the tube it's in is the worst foundation container I've ever had. I dismissed other reviews of people complaining bc I thought maybe it was user error, I was wrong. The pump leaks everywhere leaving a huge mess every time you use it. * This product is very runny, which I read in the reviews.  It doesn't take a lot of product to cover, and I really like the color (Fresco) and how it disappears after application.  My face feels hydrated most of the day after use.  I did detect a slight odor, but it was very faint, and it goes away quickly.  You just have to be careful, removing it from the tube.  Plan on it being a little messy.  I do like it so far, and it gives me a natural look. * Great product * When i first used this i was stunned by how much i loved it! It looked so skin like, it was very hydrating and wore wonderfully, but when i washed it off at the end of the day i saw all fungal acne it gave me on my forehead and around my mouth. Im sure this is beautiful on more mature skin, but if youre acne prone steer clear. * Ive always loved makeup, a full face. But when my skin starts to flake and my foundation is dry, i hate it. I wanted to stop wearing makeup completely until i tried this product. She's perfect!! No seperating, doesnt dry me out, she's flawless for 9+ hours. (I have always skin prepped so that wasnt my issue) i set with the laura m ultra blurring translucent power, chefs kiss. If you have dry skin, this product is game changing."

I don't find it luminous at all; a natural finish at best. I enjoy it more if I add a little oil when applying. It's a solid medium coverage but almost leans slightly matte to me. I had a very difficult time finding the right shade. There really wasn't a great match for me but BD21 was acceptable. I have the same shade in the Healthy Glow foundation but the shade differs with the formula. I like the Healthy Glow better as it looks more natural and it's less expensive. Still on the fence about this one. Might not be glowy enough for me. * Products gives great coverage while still feeling light on your skin. * Love this smoothing long wear foundation! * This is my second time purchasing this foundation.  I love it! Even at 56, my skin is still oily.  This foundation is not too heavy and does not break out my skin.  My only complaint is the bottle.  When I reached the end, I could not unscrew the top to get out the remaining foundation. * This foundation is thick not great if your looking for a quick application so for this one you have to work and set it. 
I have oiky skin it enhanced my pores. Returning * This was a splurge but it's one if the only clean ingredient foundation that I've found that has coverage without being drying. * Best foundation on thr market, hands down! Period! Money well spent, i love this product"

I love this make-up, coming from someone who has tried a few different brands. * I needed new foundation, but I needed something that didn't make me feel like I had makeup on AND something that would hold up to humidity. Smashbox Always On was the perfect solution! * best foundation for oily skin * I used Studio Skin for many years. The new formula is HORRIBLE. It makes my skin look worse than if I don't wear foundation at all. It's dry, streaky and the color closest to the one I used for Studio Skin makes me look like a Dorito. I switched over to Estee Lauder now because I found a great new foundation there. Bye bye, Smashbox. * I have been searching for a long wear foundation for my oily skin that holds up in the summer heat and looks great as an everyday work foundation. I  bfe tried so many foundations and many high end, I am allergic to sunscreen and most foundations melt off me in the heat. This is it! It looks great, gives me great medium coverage and i can build it up if needed or im having a rough skin day. The color is a great match and I haven't stopped wearing it since I got it. I highly recommend! * Really stays on all day and during/after workouts. Doesnt dry out my skin. I have acne prone skin and doesnt make me break out. * I was very happy with this foundation, and it is among the best foundations I have ever used.

Completelt reflective after an hour or 2 all around my tzone. And is does NOT stay on well. I use with estee lauder primer because i had some left AND i use settinf spray and powder around my nose and forehead. Would not recommend. * This works surprisingly well for my oily skin. I have the occasional period pimple, along with some skin sensitivity, but this evens out the base of my face without feeling cakey or gross. The finish is not quite matte but not dewy either, a nice middle. It feels lightweight on my skin, but i also dont use a ton of foundation either, just enough for what I prefer. Shocked at how much i like it. Oily skin can make it difficult to wear foundation, but this just works for me. * Looks natural, very easy to color match and blend, and no fragrance. 

The only negative is that the lid to the bottle is loose (the clear plastic, not the pump). * I'll start by saying this purchase resulted in a return after trying it for a week. I just couldn't comvince myself it was worth looking through the cons (from my personal experience.) 
I really liked the coverage and consistency. It was extremely lightweight and super blendable even with the coverage being a medium rate. Oddly enough, it didn't fully dry. I dont like the heavy feel of makeup on my face so having to add a powder for the foundation to set in place was a turn off for me. I also tried my best (along with an employee) to match to my skintone but still had this orange look im the end. * This foundation has the ability to provide that no-makeup look! It's got an amazing shade range & a natural, flawless finish. It's perfect for evening my skin tone on days where I have more redness, dark spots, under-eye bags & blemishes. I use it every day for work! * My fav foundation!!

I've set with a sponge, a powder pouf, a brush and the cheap sponge it comess with but it doesn't actually set. I use a huge amount and set for a while too, but my skin still feels wet to the touch after i tried setting with this powder. I've tried different techniques and applicators but I can't seem to make it work. This makes me sad becuase it's on the pricy side. * I used this a few times last week and my face started breaking out with tiny whiteheads.

I use the color Fresco and will recommend to my friends. It stays on all day and you don't have to reply. I have been using this product for years. I just needed to make sure I buy the right color. * I have been telling everyone I know about this amazing product. Best powder I've ever used for everyday. I was getting tired of my liquid foundation on my jackets etc. This powder works on my melasma and my daughter just got it for under eyes.

I was really nervous purchasing this one (and not just for the price, although it's not inexpensive) because 1, there wasn't a single YouTube review about it (even from my favorite Dior-loving, Ulta -loving ones) and 2, I was matched with a very different shade than in my Backstage color (0.5 in Backstage, I was recommended 1.5 in this formula). Without any photos of anyone who looked much like me, I put my trust in the ""shade finder"" guide and bought it with some of my Ulta rewards points.  Now I'm going to have to cough up the $$$ when I need to replace it because it's my favorite foundation ever! It's got light-to-medium coverage that I want, it blurs my texture (fine lines, pores and wrinkles) while it moisturizes just enough and leaves a pretty, natural glow to my skin (not shimmer, certainly not glitter... just the glow of youth and vitality that tends to dim a bit with age). And one to one and a half pumps does my whole face (I don't have a petite face either lol) which makes me confident a bottle will last awhile. This foundation makes me feel good about how my 50+ skin looks and the shade match is chef's kiss perfection. I've stopped looking at any other foundation... this one is my new Holy Grail! * It's just enough coverage * LOVE.  See comments anove.  Worth the price.  A little goes a little goes a ling way. * Love this natural nude foundation.
it's a perfect coverage. I still love forever matte and the Glow Foundation but this one has a unique texture and quality that works very well on my skin.  I recommend it 100% thank you Dior. * I will start by saying this is a very nice, lightweight foundation. It has almost a water light feel on the skin and never has that mask-y feel (for someone with sensory issues this was a huge plus!). The color is a nice match and it does not oxidize at all. If you are looking for that ""glass skin"" effect, this will give it to you. The coverage is sheer to medium but I personally would not call this buildable  like the description says. 

Now the cons:

While I wanted to love this foundation, after a few wears it just left me underwhelmed. It still had a very nice skin like appearance but it didn't cover my acne or dark spots and did nothing to smooth my skin or blur pores. By hour 8 it had kind of settled and disappeared into my skin. Another bummer for me is the fact it has no SPF so I now have to find another product just to layer with it. Overall nice product but not for me * I just ordered and have worn it three times now and am hooked. It goes on beautifully, it has a smell but dissipates quickly. It does not oxidize like other high end foundations I have. I even got a massage and it lasted through my face on a massage table pillow. I can wear all day and not have to blot, I have an oily T-zone. It held up through hot and humid weather of the south eastern part of the country. * Overall this is a good foundation. It gives decent coverage and lasts well when properly set with powder. But, it's not good enough for the price tag. I have many more foundations that perform just as well or better for less money."

The color match was perfect! * I have no idea how Mac cosmetics doesn't get the hype it deserves. This foundation is stunning. You don't need a lot to look your best. Covers up my rosacea with one layer. And the slight, makes your face look bright all day. I am a Mac lover from the 90s. This is one of their best products so far. * This stuff has broken me out so bad. Mac discontinued my go to foundation i have been using for over 5 years. Guess ill try another brand.. i do not recommend this at all. From no acne to about 15 pimples just from using this. Color is also way off from other products in mac line. Way more orange and dark than expected. * I tried this before it was part of the 31 days of beauty to make sure it was what I wanted. I love the coverage and the perfect match to my skin tone. I am older, so I was concerned it would settle into my skin and cause lines, and it does not. Its very nice and I like that it has good ingredients that help your skin. * I am generally a MAC stan. I love the majority of the products I've tried from them, so I was hopeful. It look a bit of work to blend, but whatever. Was tacky afterward, but I always set with their Skinfinish powder before going in with other products. I set with powder twice and spray once. If ANYTHING touched my face, my foundation wiped off with it. Had a tear from laughing? The entire inner corner sections of my eyes were bare. I've had to fix my foundation four times today, which is highly unusual. Will definitely be returning. This formulation did me dirty. * Was struggling to find the perfect foundation for working in an office setting. This is so lightweight and really does make my skin glow. Beware of a tiny bit of patchiness but other than that, its great. * I really wanted to love this product and it is a no from me. I have worked really hard to get my skin to where it is at and it broke me out so bad. I have had my acne under control and when I used this product I started breaking out like crazy! Also, the color match is way off. I was so disappointed as I use the mac foundation and I wanted to try this one as the formula seems lighter and more comfortable to wear. I wanted something for a more natural look and it did the opposite. It ruined my skin!"

I have been using this foundation for many many years through all sorts of different occasions (work, concerts,  public events outdoors, etc) and this powder always sits well and looks natural. The only rime it shows up is when I have dry flaky skin around my nose, otherwise it looks great! I always make sure skin is well hydrated and use a primer. I also use a setting spray and either rehydrate with a facial mist when needed or blot skin with tissue when I get oily * I bought this to cover up the white cast from my physical spf when my ulta didn't carry the jcat aquasurance. I fell in the ocean when a wave tossed me, attended a foam party, and plan to attend dinner with the same face of makeup I've been wearing all day. It doesn't look the absolute best, but its good enough for falling into the ocean. * So smooth and offers great coverage! I'll definitely be buying it again!! * I bought this in shade 332 and I love it! I've found for best results, apply with a damp beauty blender and use a good setting spray. I'm in a band and we play outdoors sometimes. I sweat a lot and I have oily skin. This foundation DID NOT MOVE! It covered my hyperpigmentation around my mouth and gave me flawless skin that lasted ALL DAY! It feels lightweight and doesn't transfer like liquid foundations. This is now my go to for the summer!

Gonna stick with my too faced * Beautiful satin foundation!
Not too matte and not too dewy. 
It's very runny so all I need is one pump. It blends easily with a brush or sponge. It feels light weight and doesn't crease in my smile lines. I pair it with the Too Faced BTW concealer. Shade matching was easy, I wear shade M21 which is a perfect neutral. I recommend this foundation to anyone willing to splurge. * Over the past year and a half, I have been on the journey to find a foundation that doesnt transfer, is very longwearing, and doesnt settle into my smile lines. I have tried close to 20 foundations, and none come close to this one. It is the BEST foundation i have ever tried! Buildable coverage too. Ive never gotten more compliments on my skin! A forever repurchase. * I normally love Pat McGrath makeup, and find it to be worth the price. However, I can't say the same for the foundation. I've tried applying it with different brushes/sponges, with/without primers, and/or setting sprays. No matter what I do, it doesn't wear well on my skin. First off, it's quite runny. It applies patchy/streaky, so I feel like I realy have to work with it. Then, within a short amount of time it begins to settle into any lines and separate, especially around my nose. I definitely won't be purchasing this again. * I went through bottles of other foundations, high end and drugstore before I came across this one. I got it as a sample first. I thought just try it out, see how it goes and fell in love with it. It glided perfectly onto my skin, so lightweight and blended naturally. It doesn't settle into my fine lines or wrinkles and feels like I am wearing nothing on my skin. I don't like heavy foundations or makeup on my skin, so this was perfect. I get so many compliments now on how great my makeup looks, all thanks to this foundation! Love it!"

First try I wasn't thrilled with the coverage but blamed myself because after all it's a tint. Second try I wasn't sure about the color but again blamed myself. After it oxidized it wasn't bad but I didn't like the smell. Third try, I wanted to see if maybe I just needed a different shade, as this type of product would be great for an upcoming trip. But it pilled so badly I just can't. I was coming to terms with the oxidation and determined that the resulting color works, but it pilled to the point I nearly had to wash my face and started over. I made it work so I could get to work but the smell still bothered me and my eyes burned. I'm giving up on this one. It's not for me * It is not moisturizing it in fact turned into a matte and it seeped into my pores and lines. * Product marketing did not pair with performance - drying, caking/creasing and looked like foundation. Might be better for oilier skin. Returning. * Absolutely love this!! Its my holy grail skin tint that feels lightweight and leaves a dewy finish. It literally looks like my skin just with an even tone and a glow. I like that you can build a bit more coverage, not anything crazy but another layer at the very least. * I don't have particularly dry skin, but this product makes it seem like I do! Emphasizes every imperfection on your face.

This would be acceptable if refunds were immediate, but they are not. I have been an Ulta customer for years and this experience was very disappointing. * I read some reviews about  foundation cracking but also others that work good, I decided to try but quite disappointed I think this is not good at all x mature skins.

I normally wear Estee Lauder's Stay in Place foundation, which I've always relied on. I was getting tired of how dry my face looked throughout the course of the day, so I decided to choose something with a radiant/natural finish. However, I did not want to sacrifice coverage.

Im from an area with high humidity and this stuff just does not budge, nor is it too drying. I have oily skin as well and I do not get any shine at all when paired with a silicone primer and CT Airbrush Powder. I have gotten sooooo many compliments since I began wearing this foundation. I highly recommend. * I am in love with this foundation. I am shade 8. I pair it with Glow Recipe moisturizer, Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer, Laura Mercier loose powder.  I am good for the whole day. Gorgeous finish! I am really oily btw. * M so happy I picked this foundation, it's hydrating 2 pumps give good coverage * This is such a great foundation. I do not enjoy the feeling of foundation and generally find few of them perform well and look flattering. For fair skin, this was a perfect match to my winter shade. I have never found a more accurate color. It is very matte but has a slight radiance to it. I have drier skin, so I have to do a lot of skin prep prior to applying (typically toner, Glow Recipe dew drops, moisturizer and primer) and I finish with the Hourglass Vanish setting powder. After that, it is long-wearing, oil-controlling (in T zone) and does not move. I only wish it were more dewy, but that is my only complaint about an otherwise flawless foundation. * I really like this foundation, it lasts what it promises and my skin looks radiant and you should keep in mind that it depends on how you look at the skin the foundation looks like I love it it is worth the price my color is 7.5"

All of a sudden theres no lighter shades? Not even one around the color ive been using. I've probably went through 10 of these compacts, and am beyond disappointed. Def gives me the ick for the brand!! * Perfect match for my skin tone. * I did the color match online and they matched me with a Shane that is not even available anymore. At the store I matched with 210 and the consultant said they are not going to carry that shade anymore. why would this supposedly inclusive brand cut all these different shades from their lineup? Now I guess I have to find another brand to buy powder from. * this is the BEST foundation i've ever used. i get SO many compliments on how flawless my skin looks. keeps oily and shiny skin matte for HOURS. reasonable price for quality and amount of product. also love the variety in shades, i literally found my perfect match. never using anything else again! * I love this powder foundation! I really hope Fenty continues to sell. I don't have anything bad to say. Goes great over the fenty concealer! * I've added this to my routine on top of the concealer under my eyes and between my brows.... chef kiss. * I literally cannot use this powder with my foundation. It immediately drys it and turns it into a scaly flaky mess. Maybe its just meant for use alone or with an oil based foundaton. But my drugstore powder works way way better, so its really disappointing to spend this much and not be able to use it."

It looks so nautral and evens out my skin tone while covering flaws. I really do love! * FINALLY‚Ä¶. A product that is super thin, lightweight, light coverage, AND works for my combo/oily skin! I will buy this forever! * I really didn't know how this would look on me, I usually use more silicone based foundation so... But this one was very nice. I did have to put it on the back of my hand and give a little mix first then apply it to my face. I tried pumping it directly on my skin and it didn't blend right.. This foundation is definitely not beginner friendly.  I'm sure everyone is different but this is the best method for me. Also I have dry, mature, skin. It wore nicely for about 4 hours. After that I needed a touch up. But it's definitely a nice light coverage!! * This stuff is the definition of ""your skin but better."" I've tried SO many tinted serums, wasted so much money on $40+ brands for them to be useless. I've found the easiest way to apply this is directly to your face, then blend with fingers, then blend out with a beauty blender. 

I have sensitive skin and rosacea, this is the first product I've ever used that didn't irritate or break out my skin. And weirdly, despite having pretty light coverage, this does an amazing job at covering my redness. Covering actually might not be the right word, it's more like toning almost. It doesn't look like I have anything on, yet still seems to almost eliminate my redness (which has always been severe). I have no clue how this works, I swear it's magic because  I cannot understand it. 

Coverage is somewhat buildable, but definitely meant to be used lightly. It'll get cakey if you set it with powder, and then if it gets wet it'll lift really weird, but I don't ever feel the need to use powder. Powder blush and brozer work fine over it, just not setting your whole face. I'll go all day just with this and not get oily at all, it doesn't slide off like other tinted serums, and when it does wear it looks really natural. A bit sticky at first but it will dry down, and feels like there's nothing on your face! Definitely is somewhat waterproof, by far the most oit of any other product like this I've tried. 

I've worn this to bed many times without any breakouts, and in the morning I truly can't tell whether there's any of it left on my face (in a good way), because my skin looks better after wearing this. Probably the bakuchiol, which is what prompted me to buy it bc I already use a serum with that every night that I love. 

And again, I don't have great skin to begin with, and I've gotten endless compliments on my skin since I started using this. People saying my rosacea looks better, pores, texture, etc. 

I don't bother with reviews much, but man, every time I use this stuff, every time I look in the mirror I can't stop thinking how good my skin looks, and how natural. * The first few times I used this I thought it looked beautiful on the skin when first applied. But noticed after being on my skin for a little bit my skin felt tight. I should have looked at the ingredients first. Benzyl Alcohol is pretty high on the list of ingredients. unfortunately, it makes my already dry skin drier. * I've used this a few times and have been loving it on my no makeup makeup days when I don't want a full coverage base. I get hormonal acne along my chin so it tends to leave acne scars, so this doesn't fully cover them up but it still gives a natural finish. 

It leaves my skin looking healthy, covers my spider veins, provides light coverage under my eyes in place of concealer, and gives me an all around healthy glow. 

I do 2 pumps and rub it between my hands first then spread evenly onto my face before using a brush to buff it out. I recommend this if you're starting out with makeup or if you prefer a natural finish. * This is so beautiful if you mix it in your hands first, apply with fingers and finish with a sponge. It's so skinlike and lasts all day for me. However‚Äî why did they put bakuchiol in it üò≠ I didn't think it would be that noticeable but I can't wear this everyday or else it starts stinging. Such a shame because I love how it looks and want to wear it everyday! I wish brands would keep makeup and skincare separate."

Disappointed, definitely not neutral. * Great product! I love this foundation it feels like your skin , great colors to match your skin! * Nice coverage but very oily * I really wanted to like this foundation, but I just don't. I have mainly normal type skin, with an oily patch around my nose. When I wear this foundation, I get an oil POOL around my nose. After a few hours, my skin just doesn't have the same coverage :( * don't buy it if you break out easily or if you have oily skin * I love this foundation and for me it never seems to break me out it's light weight and has just the right amount of coverage!!

i personally prefer a dewy and natural look, and something that evens out my skin tone. i find that other makeup sits well on top of it, the only time ive seen it move around because of another product is when i tried to put the saie illuminator on top. if your preferences are like mine i think you will like this product !! * I don't know why this isn't sold in stores! It's absolutely fantastic! I don't normally like wearing liquid foundation because it feels heavy but this one is so light and actually does provide good coverage without the heaviness. I have plenty of acne scars and discoloration and it makes my skin appear almost flawless - basically solid coverage without feeling like full coverage heavy foundation. I don't even need to wear concealer under my eyes or elsewhere when I use this. I like to apply it by squeezing a few lines onto each area of my face directly from the tube and then work it in with a brush. I go back in with a dab of liquid bronzer to give my face dimension. If I have time I'll let it dry 5-10 min and set very lightly by pushing in some setting powder. It ends up with a nice dewy finish but if you go heavier on the setting powder you can get closer to matte if that's what you like. Lastly, I wear the ivory shade which works in combination with the bronzer but would otherwise be too pale (I'm a 2N1 in Estee Lauder powder in winter and 2N2 in summer). I just ordered the golden ivory in this product for summer but again, with bronzer the ivory still works for me all year. * I wanted to love this! It goes on very smoothly, which is great. But I wouldn't say it is buildable because it's so oily it never dries enough for a second coat‚Äîif you wanted. About 2pm I look so oily bc my powder has dissolved. I tried it about a month and kept wondering why my face was always shiny‚Äîand felt oily. I thought it was new moisturizer but it's not. It's this. If you have dry skin‚Äîthis would be perfect! * I can't believe how great this product is at such a reasonable price point. My skin is very dry and  so most foundations were settling into my fine lines or emphasizing scaliness. This foundation does not do that and it is incredibly hydrating. I like natural coverage and this does that perfectly but I think it could be buildable, too. I find that it does transfer pretty easily but I think that's the trade-off for it being so moisturizing. I just a put a little powder to set it and that seems to help. * This product did not work for me. I am 43 with combination skin seeking a foundation with spf. It felt amd looked very shiny. I live in Florida and need something long wear and humidity proof. I am a fan of L'Oreal just not this one. * I dont like yhat everything had nucinimide its so irritating for mt skin :( * This product is just okay. Application is great, easy to blend and definitely buildable. I started with just one layer first with my fingers but it didn't blend well so went in with a brush. I may try again with a beauty blender because the brush wasn't bad but it was trying to cling to texture and dry patches. It wore well around my pores (not well in fine lines!!) until i tried to do a touch up. It just moved everything and removed the base completely. I would recommend embracing any texture or oil because you can't touch this foundation up dyrung the day."

I was using a matte foundation (Chanel) for many years due to oily skin, but it started feeling kind of dry on my 60 y/o skin. My skin feels young again. And it glows. 
This one is a keeper! * Unlike any other foundation or concealer that I've tried.  Literally, this is magic.  Evens tone, covets flaws, smooths every textural flaw, diminishes pores, seems to moisturize any dry patches, and feels like I'm wearing no makeup.  It's absolute must-try for anyone over 50yo and doesn't love the typical look of foundation. Yes, I'm ordering a backup. * I tried the Water Fresh Tint when it first came out and didn't like it at all. There was absolutely no coverage. This though, is what i was hoping for with the tint. The Complexion Touch is so good. It's beautiful on the skin and has a light to light medium coverage, and it feels like nothing on the skin. Don't use the brush that comes with it to apply because its way too small, however I've found that its a really good concealer brush. My only gripe with this foundation is that you go through it pretty fast. Im already halfway through my second bottle and this stuff is pricey. But it's totally worth it. * Love it, it's moisturizing without getting too oily, wears light on the face and doesn't look cakey. Easy to throw in the purse. * Just not for me. It feels heavy and greasy. I couldn't stand it. * I have tried different bases and no matter what base I use, this pills awful! Rubs off as I'm applying. Have tried with a brush and using fingers. Try another Chanel product. * I loved this foundation, is super light weight and easy to blend. It keeps my skin hydrated and looks natural. A little goes a long way. Perfect for winter when my skin is dry"

Stays all day & looks like skin. Best foundation I've ever used. * this foundation blends out EFFORTLESSLY. the coverage is amazing, a little goes a long way as its thicker coming out but feels weightless on the skin. i use shade 650 Alexandria for my light almost medium skin tone with a cool/neutral undertone. cool underone foundations tend to pull pinky on my skin so this shade is perfection! highly recommend, great price for great quality! * I reach for this when I need full coverage and long lasting- weddings, long work days, etc. It is pretty remarkable how good this is. However, as Ive been getting older, i do find i need to mix it with other foundations to keep it from settling into fine lines and wrinkles. It can easily make me look drier and more mature. I think its perfect for anyone with normal to oily who doesnt need to worry about aged skin at this time in their life. * I love this, it's very matte so just be aware of that. The coverage is amazing. Its lightweight and buildable.  It's so velvety and looks like skin. I will continue buying this. * Best full coverage * I'm a medium cool neutral skin tone with oily combination skin - 540 Giza.
I layer usually with additional contouring darker shades to warm up my skin tone and add more dimension, but it's very light, minimual layering, as I do not like to wear anything heavy.

This foundation is awesome! I L O V E it because of how much a little goes a long way. I tend to prep my skin with moisturizer and primer for smoother application. I tend to apply light layers, which may be way this product has lasted so long for me - I do not like thick layers, nor do I feel that I need to layer so much of the product to get decent coverage. It has a nice mattifying effect, but does not accentuate lines or cause any unflattering crepe-y undereye area. If you're looking for something ""glowy"" or something of a pearlescent finish like a CC cream or tinted moisturizer, this may not be for you - it is quite mattifying, and despite my light handed application (like I mentioned earlier, a little goes a long time), it does offer good coverage without the cake-on effect. 

In pictures, it helps my face look more even and helps with my shiny t-zone area. 

I got these when they were 50% off, and had purchased 2. I know my first tube I'm currently on is nowhere close to being out, but I do wear foundation only on special occasions. 

I live in hot humid Texas, and have yet to experience any breakout with this product."

Also, not right color.  Didn't want to order again.  However, good cruelty-free product, so might work for someone else. * This goes on smooth, doesn't crease or cake, blends easily, and is just the perfect amount of coverage (not too much, not too little). It's a moderate amount of coverage, but seems buildable if you need more. So happy I gave this a try! * I love this, just turned 30 and skin is changing, dry combo skin, and have been trying new foundations the last couple years. Estee lauder hydra rescue foundation was my main go-to. I tried about face and liked it, but its heavy and transfers easily. Nars felt too orange and heavy and the bottle leaks. Ilia serum foundation is greasy and bare minimum coverage with a steange smell but feels good for my skin once it sinks in. Clinique even better serum foundation was also decent but this is is. Goes on smooth and easyoly sets with primer/powder. Good coverage. Feels light. I hope this sticks around for awhile. The shade match was wrong as most are for me as im fair with some freckles and rosacea so I recommend going 1-2 shades lighter, and then you can always blend it easier with bronzer/concealer to get perfect match. * I am shocked thus stuff isnt viral. It has a gorgeous natural matte finish that can be built up or done lightly depending on your preference. I am 42 with combo skin and large pores; this definitely minimizes my pores and blends seamlessly with the shape tape concealer. * Great coverage - very smooth and cloud like * Not a natural finish. This looks like you are wearing heavy makeup. It accentuates pores and peach fuzz-even with primers. The color I ordered (16B) seemed off. I honestly thought I received the wrong color because it was so dark and orange. I have 20B shape tape concealer that I compared side by side with this product on my skin, and the 20B looks way lighter and cooler compared to this in 16B. I have used their foundcealer in 16B in the past and it was a decent match. So good luck finding a match with the color inconsistency of this product!"

I have been searching for a foundation like this for YEARSSS. (I have super sensitive combo skin leaning dry. Liquid foundations always look terrible on me after 1 hour. I do great skin prep too!) Lightweight, breathable foundation, quality ingredients, minimal ingredients, fragrance free, light to medium coverage, skin like finish, 6 to 8 hour wear still looking flawless, doesnt dry my skin out, doesnt irritate my skin, doesnt cling to dry patches, COLOR MATCH ON POINT, skincare ingredients, AFFORADABLE, anti-pollution (I live in SLC, worst air quality/pollution here) I  literally cried when i first put this foundation on i was so blown away at how perfect it was. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NEVER EVER discontinue or reformulate. I am a customer for life and this foundation has changed my life. * very skin like finish! no fuss foundation. * This is an undetectable foundation on my mature, dry skin, though it can build easily for extra coverage. I will just add additional drops on those darker spots, which still peek through but look more homogenous. But coverage is not my main concern, so this winner maintains the slightly dewy glow over a well -prepped skin base, still looking un made-up by the end of the day. Also, goes over mineral sunscreen flawlessly. IMO it is on par with Haus Labs, Nars Radiant LIght, MUF reboot; my other favs. I am trying another shade, though am happy with Katey, the match I found via the skin models- so that's my recommendation for finding your shade, rather than the description. It is on sale, so... TRY IT! * I'm assuming this foundation is on clearance because of quality issues‚Ä¶ I received my order and the formula is completely separated and cannot be mixed back together to a good consistency. * I was so surprised when i first used it, my skin looked like skin. I like a lightweight natiral finish and this gives me exactly that! It also stays on all day/night, only thing is that it oxidizes a little bit but not wnything drastic. Has been my go-to foundation for over a year already! * good match for hard shade (fair/light olive) and good for sensitive/acne prone/scar/texture skin. decent coverage but feels light and natural. but doesnt really set (makeup smudges on my cat) & taking the top off pulls the entire pump out sometimes * I have used this foundation for a few years and it's never let me down. I fluctuate between a range of their lighter, cool toned shades depending on the time of year. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. A few things I've learned along the way: 

*A thin base layer will cover most spots and uneven tones. If you need more coverage, then spot treat with a little more foundation.
*It pairs beautifully on top of Nudestix tinted sunscreen.
*Applies well with brushes or sponges, but better with your fingers.
*A stippling, dabbing motion is the best method to apply the thin layers.

I'm 41, and I receive many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation, and I feel like I look more youthful with this on. I will definitely continue to repurchase!"

Now I have to look for a cheap one till I can match it with a different company. Yuk! * I absolutely hate the new formula. Exchanged it 3 times, still can't find a match. New formula is oily. I can see lines I didn't know I had within hours. Does not set. Leaves my face looking extremely shiny & oily. I need the old formula & my old color back. * I love BM products, but this one was a no for me. I'm in my mid-40's and my skin, which used to be combination to oily and prone to acne, changed to normal to dry. So, I changed my beauty routine and make-up products to adjust.

I know part of it is coming off on my hands when I touch my face, but I think part of it is soaking into my skin too?? * Yesterday I walked into Ulta and saw they are finally carrying this product in the store and I was able to swatch it. I bought it and tried it on. It worked out great and my skin is actually really comfortable in it. I'm pregnant and there are times where I just fall asleep out of nowhere probably because of my pregnancy hormones or whatever. Also, I noticed that my skin is changing so this product also helps with fine lines and my pregnancy skin. I do recommend it. however, the next day, I looked up this brand and didn't realize there was so much controversy around it. I had no idea. I'm going to keep it since it's a great product however there is so much negative hype about this. * it goes on so smooth, no scent, dont listen to spam this product is great! I hope because of one mistake it doesnt get discontinued for everyone * Please don't waste time or money on this product, it's not worth the price,shade rang is a joke,formula will break you out. * TERRIBLE"

It is very light coverage but buildable. It's glowy but not oily/greasy. I will say if you have acne, dark marks, etc. it might not cover the way you want the first time but I find this the perfect work / daytime product. It matches my skin tone PERFECTLY. From drugstore it's a bit pricey but I will 100% repurchase. * Good coverage, great shade match and lots of product! My only thing is that it does fade as I wear it, but I do touch my face sometimes. Will buy again. * I've never really tried Revolution Beauty makeup but when this went a little viral I figured why not since it was so cheap! But I was very impressed. I have dry-combo skin and am pale with freckles. The color options worked for me as I am on the more neutral side. The finish was pretty. I used it fot a wedding I was in and my makeup looked great all night even in the 90 degree heat. It paired well with all my other products too. * My wife has perioral dermatitis so we've been trying every foundation under the  to find one that doesn't irritate her skin and highlight the flaking when it is flaring up. This has been the best one so far for sure. She has tried higher end products and they still irritated her skin. Is it the best one so far? Yes. But we're still on the hunt. They didn't offer many pink undertones mostly yellow. * I've been using this for about 8 months now and  really love it.  I apply using a brush and it is nice coverage and always looks good. * I will definitwly pick this up in my winter shade! It seems like it would go well with multiple typee of skin and is just riding the line between medium and light coverage. It certainly is mot heavy! So smooth and blendibld. * This is now my go-to makeup! It matches my skintone perfectly. Medium to build coverage. Its literally a perdect dupe for Makeup Forever HD skin foundation and over half the price!"

It stays on all day.  I don't have to powder touch up at all.  No SPF is the only negative, but I always have an SPF moisturizer underneath.  I highly recommend this! * This is probably the worst foundation I have used. First off, the applicator is interesting.. and this product smells so bad. It doesn't melt into the skin like most foundations, it kinda just sits on top of the skin and settles into cracks and pores. It is SOOO drying, even with primer! I used a primer and moisturizer and it still sucked all the moisturizer out of my skin. I tried to make this product work but it's just formulated bad. * This is the best coverage in a foundation.  Goes on so easy with sponge applicator and stays on all day.  I don't even need to do a powder touch up.  I highly recommend it."

I tried this on in-store. Wasn't in love with it, but P√ºr changed their tinted moisturizer's colors and they no longer looked good on my skin.

This tint has almost no coverage. It is watery and streaks. Be careful because it will just run out of the tube. It also clings to my dry spots (mostly my chin and around the nose).  I definitely moisturize before I put it on. I've tried it with a brush. I've tried it with a sponge. I've tried it with my fingertips. But it's all the same. It just looks horrible and I could not recommend this. * Super greasy and streaky whether you use a brush or sponge. I understand its a skin tint but has zero coverage. Separating on my nose and chin and will cling on to dry spots. 0/10 recommend * Left a rash after being on my skin for 2 minutes. The burning started and I washed it off immediately, and this is what I was left with. There is virtually no coverage. Buy a tinted sunscreen, or a better skin tint like the one from Ilia. * Should have taken the reviews seriously‚Ä¶ If I had kept the box it would be returned‚Ä¶. It is a watery mess‚Ä¶ There is a chemical odor‚Ä¶ And the color is off‚Ä¶probably due to the consistency‚Ä¶ I used the previous version of this product for years‚Ä¶and am extremely disappointed with this ""new and improved"" version of the product‚Ä¶. Nothing stays the same‚Ä¶ What was wrong with old Tinted Moisturizer that it needed to be changed‚Ä¶watered down‚Ä¶? This was a total waste of money‚Ä¶ this tinted moisturizer will go down drain where it belongs‚Ä¶! (Don't set the tube in the upright position on the cap‚Ä¶it will be a mess when opened‚Ä¶) * At first glance this seemed promising but about only and hour the product caked and separated on my skin, this isnt the worst part. It gave me a severe reaction, im now walking around with a painful rash on my face. I will be returning this. * Just a skin tint, has lots of fragrance in it. * I love this for a ""no makeup"" glow. I waited 20 min after my skin care and applied using my fingers. I was so happy it went on flawlessly and blended so nicely. Truly looks like my skin but better. It feels hydrating and lightweight, and lasted all day without creasing. Love it!"

I've had it a few weeks and hit pan already. * This by far is the best, I use Tanzania. It's totally worth the price. Before I used other cheaper products and by mid day my makeup was gone, even with setting spray. But this product not only last all day. But I have an amazing glow, a natural glow. * finally FINALLY a full coverage powder that isn't giving pancake!!! im so fair and have pink undertones and most brands don't make a pinky tone powder AND be full coverage! this powder keeps me matte, covers my roseca, and doesn't look cakey! best BEST powder I've tried * I got this to try since I prefer a casual powder foundation for day-to-day wear. It was SO BAD. I was excited because they have a great range for pale shades, but after wearing it for a bit it oxidized SO bad and I looked orange. It also went on cakey and dry, and gave me almost no coverage when applied with a brush. It felt hard to blend. Not recommended. * This compact is a game changer!

Unfortunately the moment i put it on my skin the color was immediately to warm for my complexion, i got the heavenly honey. It looked WAY to orange and when i washed it off it looked like pure orange on my skin. It showed every ounce of texture on my skin (i dont have much texture) and sunk into every pore. Would not recommend at all. * Wanted a stick foundation for a light everyday makeup look. This is perfect! I use about 3 swipes on both sides of my face to even out my complexion. Blends best with a damp sponge followed by a foundation brush. Also love the neutral undertones!! * Love using this have been doing this now for 5 years. Have not been disappointed. * I finally found a stick foundation that matches my skin so well.  I put it directly on my skin after moisturizing and pat it in with a make up sponge.   Using a press shine eliminator my be helpful for oiler skin.  I love this foundation and I will be purchasing it again. * I came in hoping to get what I usually used but my shade was not in stock.  I walked around the store looking for something I could use.  Came upon this product and color was perfect.  I bought two in case I run out. * This is greasy and rubs off easily.

Big fan of the low price too! * Horrible shades to choose from * Good product, but not sure about lasting16 hours (only need it for 8 hours).  Goes on smooth, stay put and hides imperfections.  This is my second purchase of #14 (Expresso). * Decided to try this after Ulta Adjustable Powder Foundation was out of most colors for literally WEEKS, in-store and online.

I still haven't gotten to trying the MAC one, but this Milani foundation is incredible and is a lot better than I expected! It's medium to full coverage, looks super natural but flawless on the skin, and is actually less greasy/shiny than most of my liquid foundations which us surprising for a cream. It does set to a satin, powdery finish, and wears beautifully with a touch of powder on top if you have more oily skin like I do. Also, the shades Warm Beige and Sand Beige have really nice neutral-yellow undertones that can match many medium complexions very well! Definitely happy I found my new favorite, easy to apply foundation! This is a lot less messy and quick to apply than liquid foundations, which I love! A brush or a sponge will work equally as great with this stuff and look flawless :) Definitely recommend it! Thanks, Milani!! < 3 * This is very inexpensive and lasts longer than Estee Lauder all day foundation. I didn't have a bald spot on my nose like Estee Lauder at the end of the day. The shineyness at the end of the day was minimal and I have oily T-zone, combo skin. It didn't crease in my fine lines or accentuate my pores. Mac and Estee Lauder powder foundations both did this and were oily right away. I used Laura Mercier primer and Urban Decay setting spray. I use a beauty blender sponge to apply. Milani worked better than more expensive brands. Just try it! Use finishing powder to set before spraying your face. * this is the first powder foundation i have tried and im never going back to liquid foundation. * After hearibg all the amazing things about this foundation I wanted to love it. I've had such a hard time trying to grab enough product to evenly blend out. I've used my fingers, foundation brush, flat foundation brush, beauty blender, etc. now it just feels like the foundation is dried out and pretty useless at this point. * would think shade range wouldn't be an issue anymore with any brand. they either don't go dark enough or don't go light enough. or if they do, they only offer 1 undertone which doesn't work either. * I love Milano but this was a no for me."

It was a perfect match for me and it really looks like my skin but better. It hides the general redness of my skin but still allows for my freckles to pop through which really makes it feel more natural. It doesn't even look or feel makeupy to me. It leaves behind a natural finish with a subtle glow, but not glittery or even shimmery. It's kind of magical. It really is a new favorite! Smashbox was not even on my radar! * I was genuinely impressed with this tinted moisturizer. It provided the perfect amount of sheer coverage, which I prefer for everyday wear. I'm particularly pleased that it includes SPF, which is a fantastic bonus. The finish is like a light dew, giving my skin a healthy and radiant glow without appearing overly dewy. It's incredibly lightweight and fragrance-free, which I find refreshing. I highly recommend this product. * I was pleasantly surprised by this. It goes on almost like a foundation but goes into the skin so smoothly and softly. It's not heavy at all and this color was a perfect match for my skin. It also greatly helped my redness. I do have combo skin so I felt a little oilier than normal at the end of the day. However, overall it is amazing! * This gives great coverage. You can see in the picture I provided as it goes on as I am only wearing this tinted moisturizer. For my oily skin, this did not last all. It made it to maybe lunch. I also wish it had more SPF as I need 25 coverage. I do like to put it on with tinted lip balm and a swipe of eye shadow for a low key night look. * This product has a medium buildable coverage which is good for an every day makeup look. The finish is natural and  glowy. The product itself is not long lasting though. * This tinted moisturizer is amazing!!! I love that it very light and the coverage is great. The packaging is super cute and I will definitely be purchasing! * I recently tried the Smashbox Halo Glow Tinted Moisturizer, and I'm thoroughly impressed! The texture is lightweight and blends seamlessly into the skin, providing a natural, dewy finish that brightens my complexion without feeling heavy.

The coverage is perfect for everyday wear‚Äîjust enough to even out my skin tone while still allowing my freckles to peek through. I love how it hydrates my skin throughout the day without making it oily. Plus, the added SPF is a fantastic bonus for sun protection.

The packaging is sleek and travel-friendly, making it easy to toss in my bag. Overall, this tinted moisturizer has quickly become a staple in my makeup routine. If you're looking for a product that offers a fresh, radiant look while keeping your skin hydrated, I highly recommend giving this a try!"

It has never broken me out and lasts the entire day. I use this with the nyx plump right back primer and my makeup does not move at all. Even in 100+ degree weather, this foundation does not sweat off or become patchy. I have gone through about 6 or 7 bottles of this and my only negative thing to say about it is the pump hardly works on every bottle i've had, but the product itself is so good that it doesn't bother me. Better than any other foundation i've ever tried, even high end. * Cool toned/neutral pale/fair skin. Great formula, repurchased multiple times. * Okay but it leaks bad. * Very cakey but amazing coverage * It's a smeary mess after 2 hours. I wanted to like this. The color matched my skin, no matter how I prime it or what powder I use, it just looks bad on the skin after an hour or two. It looks smeary and doesn't blend well, sits on top of the skin. Wouldn't recommend. * This is one of the worst foundations ive ever used. To start, the bottle is frosted and there are no testers so trying to find a shade match that is even somewhat close is nearly impossible. Second, it smells like paint. Usually scent doesnt bother me but this was very noticeable. It was also extremely thick. I even added water like some reveiws say to do to thin it out and while it helped some, it wasnt enough to save it. Similar to the smell, this just looks like paint when applied. It doesnt blend well and excentuates every small bump or crease. Even with settjng powder and spray it feels oddly tacky and doesnt look like skin at all. It just sits on top like a thick layer of paint. The wear is also horrible. It breaks up in strange places that I have never had issues with before. It rubs off at the slightest touch. It all together just looks like a cakey mess.  Do not get this foundation. * Love this foundation and Ulta sells out of my shade often.  I'm olive, tan and this is the closest most perfect shade match in a foundation that I have found that's full coverage.  Nice thick consistency but not too thick.  Matte finish."

Coverage is not very good either. It's very thin and extremely oily. Usually I do like their other products but this is definitely not it. I have tried it both with primer and without. Neither way lasted all day as it just essentially slid off. * the coverage on this is amazing you can wear on it's own and leaves a beautiful glow but if you have oily skin like me i don't recommend, you'll look a mess lol * I had extremely high hopes for this product. I read all the reviews watched the YouTube videos and was ready to go.  First I tried the shade Punta Cana (5) and it was too dark. Then I went back and got the shady Giza (6) and it was too late, so I decided to mix both of them together, hoping it would balance out. I don't understand how a product can have so much pigment but no coverage if that makes sense.  The product is highly pigmented and when you put it on, you can clearly see there's makeup on your face however, I have a few blemishesthat it provided coverage 0 coverage for.  It didn't matter how much product I went back and dabbed on the blemishes still no coverage. I even let it sit and dry down hoping that would thicken it up but still no coverage.  Also, it was not glowing or dewy for me. I looked straight up Greasy, even with just the first layer, I looked sweaty like I had been out in the sun. It was not a flattering look. I even tried powdering it down, but it just looked greasy with powder on top which basically turned cakey and even with all that I could still see my blemishes through.  I purchased this this evening and I will be returning it immediately when the store opens tomorrow.  I love Juvia's Places' products and I will still continue to support and purchase, but this just didn't work for me.  Buyer beware. * I tried this thanks to a friend who has it and gave me a 'sample' (thank you, girlfriend!).  I must say, yes, it's better than the ones by e.l.f. and Charlotte Tilbury.  You can use it alone for a subtle glow and coverage, or mixed with your foundation (for the same effect).  Looks great either way.  I'm planning on getting a bottle for myself.  I do recommend it. * Elf Halo Glow broke me out and I never was able to try the Flawless Filter by CT but I dont think I need to because I discovered this and I LOVEEEE it. Perfect under foundation or just by itself. Gives me a perfect glow without making me look greasy * I bought this to try out since I couldnt justify spending $$ on charlotte tilbury. I love this formula & finish!! I couldve color matched better if I bought in person vs online, but the shade i got still works for my dry skin. Defintely going to be using this during Summer * From the color to the way it applies and blends, it's the best thing I've experienced in a while and I will be getting more shades. This may just be the product that will be my foundation, concealer and contour!"

If you're an oilslick like me‚Ä¶ this is a total waste. Maybe good for dryer skin? Going back to Dior at this price point and won't be purchasing this one again. * This foundation brought out texture and wrinkles I have never seen before. It is not very blend-able, as it takes a lot of manipulation to look somewhat acceptable. This product is very drying and I have oily skin. Not to mention it does not adhere to the skin, it slips and sides off your face throughout the day leaving you patchy. * I finally found my holy grail foundation, I didn't even buy it at Ulta but that's how much I loved it to write a review. It feels like I'm wearing nothing, it matches my skin perfectly which has been a nightmare for years trying to find a good match. * This coverage is a lot more sheer and dewy than I had anticipated. This would be a beautiful foundation for someone with dry, mature skin since it does not crease. The colors are not accurate either. I suggest ordering one to two shades darker. * I need to keep looking. I have a full bottle that I hope to find someone that it works for. * I was so disappointed in this product because I had been saving to buy it for such a long time and when I used it, it melted off and had to use a lot of setting powder to keep it in place somewhat!!

Also primer/no primer the product goes on well. * Very very easy for applying on skin  love this product * overall, this product is pretty terrible for me at least. very greasy & oily, transfers easily, little to no coverage on my acne & stuck to dry patches. did no justice for me whatsoever. * I use it on my whole face starting around my eyes nose an spread it my cheeks and chin.before I use blush. * I had to mix it with another foundation to color match it but it looks cakey and not full coverage * I bought this for my mom hoping it would give her enough coverage but it's almost sheer in spots. * But I don't. I know it's like a holy grail for a lot of people... but for me. It's terrible. It creases and I don't get the greatest coverage. Sorry, I'm sticking with my shape tape"

It feels so nourishing and applies so evenly. It's light yet gives a good medium coverage. A great summertime weight. Not heavy but yet just enough color. Love it. Buy it. Give it a try. I think you'll like it. * This foundation is so perfect for me. It blends perfectly into my skin. It's so easy to apply. I just dab it on with a beauty sponge and I'm done in minutes! 
I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è * I'm not sure why my skin reacts to foundation so terribly, but even the luxury brands make me look a little off. I know my undertone and have been able to pinpoint my exact color profile, so it's not that. Foundation usually sits on top of my face, amplifies my fine lines, and makes me look like a hot mess. Age Perfect Tinted Balm is the only foundation that makes me look better, and I wish I knew about it sooner. It's my favorite! * I have what the skincare industry refers to as ""mature ""skin. I am a make junkie and I had many foundations from drugstores and major department stores but as I got older they all made me look cake and settled into lines. I stumbled on this product and I love it. It's my skin only better. It lasts almost all day on my  combination oily dry skin. It is a wonderful product with light medium coverage for mature skin. Will definitely buy again * I've used 3 pots of this now and I'm still somehow surprised by how nice it is. The formula feels like it won't cover much, but it softens the appearance of/seems to fill and even out pores, scars, wrinkles, or any textures--I often get compliments on how smooth my skin looks when I use this. I've gone back and forth between two colors because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the color match is a little difficult. All in all, I keep trying new foundations just to come back to this one and be impressed by it. * I'm a light-medium skin tone that leans towards cool. I got started on this because an influencer raved about it a few yrs. ago. I decided to try it and couldn't had been more thrilled. I use shade fair 20 for reference. In the pot it looks more like a peach shade. It glides on effortlessly and melts into my skin. My dry/mature skin looks healthy. I'm sure I will get tired of this foundation, but for the last 3 yrs. I've been pleased. Only time will tell. * I was very skeptical to try this and was shocked. It is so good. 47 year old combo skin, apply with real techniques dense brush and its better than high end. How is this not more popular?"

I actually found it quite drying. I love HG products and am so glad Ulta is carrying them. I hope they'll carry the newer HG skin tint so I can try that one. * Im 55 and my skin is very dry, this product is moisturizing and never settles in my pores , an excellent alternative to foundation which just sat on my skin, this tinted moisturizer does not do that. I would highly recommend this product- * I have never had so many compliments about my skin since using this tinted moisturizer! It may not be for anyone needing full coverage makeup but someone looking for a glow and slight coverage! * It was very hard to find something for my aging skin that is full coverage, but doesn't settle into lines and look caked on. this was recommended in store and I absolutely love it! I apply with a beauty blender and use shape tape concealer with a tiny bit of setting powder. Really makes a difference being hyaluronic and any pictures while wearing come out great. A must in my drawer. * I wanted to like this. I have dry skin and some creepiness at 52. This made all of that worse.

It's very thick and kinda hard to blend out even with moisturizer and primer. 
I had to return this and buy the Too Faced brand hydrating liquid foundation. * Several comments said this was medium to full coverage which made me want to try it and it is not. There is absolutely no coverage at all. If anything it's just a glorified moisturizer so I'm thinking those other comments were for a different product. * Absolutely one of my favorite foundation. I love how it leaves my skin glowing and hydrated!"

Also great for touch-ups when mineral foundation SPF is needed out in the sun! The closing latch wasn't super secure but I never had a problem with it opening in my purse. The new design is thick and super heavy. It's beautiful to sit on a counter, but useless weight for travel or carried in a shoulder bag. So sad I never odered backs up of the slim gold-tone compact! * I was surprised how expensive this compact is. But I have had so many contacts break and then I get crumbled pressed powder. This one looks like it will hold up well. I will let you know the first time I drop it-Yikes! * Very happy with this new compact. My JI mineral foundation stores securely,  the compact opens easily and now has a mirror. Yay! * I am a loyal Jane Iredale brand user. In fact, I have been using their products for over 20 years. The Jane Iredale line was recommended to me by the surgeon who did facial reconstruction after skin cancer surgery. 

Although I love their products, I have always been ""ehh"" about their packaging....until now! Thanks for finally giving up the gaudy gold (sorry, Jane Iredale) and going with this new, modern and aesthetically pleasing line of packaging. Since I have several of the old gold compacts, including the gold metals ones, I ordered one of the new compacts to see how I would like it. After receiving the new compact, I cannot wait to replace ALL my older versions! 

One more suggestion... in your future development, please consider making your eye shadows available in refills. I love the idea of being kinder to our planet and saving on the excess packaging. I do not mind paying separately for the cases if I know if is making a smaller, greener impact for future generations. =)

One final note of thanks to Ulta...I have been begging my local store to start carrying Jane Iredale. I am glad to see that you are at least finally carrying this amazing, clean line of makeup online! * I bought this on sale and I'm glad I did. It just makes it nice to put your foundation in. For the price of the foundation, it's a shame you have to purchase compact separately. * This packaging is overpriced and by default should be included with the powder. Waste of money."

I buy this again & again & pair it with concealer for under eyes / blemishes , & blush. Its so smooth, never breaks out my acne prone skin. I love it so much!! * Honestly I hate foundation, I have super sensitive skin and anything can break me out easily. This foundation is SO NICE!! It is more like a skin tint than a foundation, which I prefer if I do ever wear it, the smell is relaxing (if you're not an essential oil person I wouldn't recommend, the lavender is pretty strong), and it doesn't feel like anything is on. For my Florida girls this stuff is a great quick fix for the hot and humid days!! * I have super sensitive, rosacea-prone skin & my eyes are really easily irritated by makeup (ocular rosace) that started a few years ago - suddenly I couldn't wear my favorite makeup without breaking out, & my eyes burning, bright red. I searched & finally found a brand specifically for rosacea-prone skin! So happy to be able to wear makeup again! Over the last year or so the formula clearly changed - I couldn't find a color match & then my eyes started to  burn again. Back to the search - finally found this - I love this foundation & the whole product line! It's light & looks great - as others have said, I look like myself, only better! It doesn't settle in my lines or pores, doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It does feel a bit oily / has a bit of shine. Also, Nude 3 is a perfect color match for me when it goes on, but it does darken a bit across the day so I'm going to try 2.5 & save 3 for the summer. Otherwise, highly recommend!! * I bought this foundation and love it.  I'm 47 years old with dry and pigmented skin from aging and I like light coverage products due to aging skin look more natural than full coverage foundation.  Very moisturizing.  I still set with loose powder and yes would buy this as long as nudestix still made this. * I got this product in shades light3 it a good tinted moisturizer with light to medium at most.  Great for dry skin.  Love this product. * Flawless and lightweight. I'm in love. * im telling you right now GET THIS. the PERFECT natural foundation that isnt too sheer or too high coverage. also the single foundation i have that is my true shade!!!! i can blend this out so well even w my hands which i cant typically w other foundations and it blends out BEAUTIFULLY. funny thing is i bought this on mistake,, was trying out concealer and wanted to buy it but accidentally picked this up instead.

I've tried every popular brand in the world (under $50) and just couldnt find a product my skin liked until this one. 

I have both very oily and very dry skin and zero skin care routine so a lot of that is likely due to me being a bit terrible. But I was randomly recommended this over a year ago by a guy at the mall of America morphe store and it genuinely felt like second skin. He paired it with morphe primer and it's the best my skin ever has or will look. It looks so natural and yet makes my skin look amazing. You can't even tell I'm wearing foundation. 

I sadly ran out and tossed the bottle before ordering more like an idiot and I've spent the last 5 months trying to track this foundation down. I just ordered more so unless the formula has changed drastically I'll add pictures once I have it. But I was genuinely mourning the loss of this foundation and thought I was doomed to have cakey looking skin again forever. 

If you can't find a foundation no matter how many you try I highly highly recommend this one. Maybe my skin is just weird so it might not work for you but I will never ever allow myself to run out of this foundation again. It's been a terrible few months for my makeup without it. * I really love this foundation. I used to use MAC and like this much better after trying a bunch of different brands. I have very sensitive skin and no problems. I have been using this for years now and I am very happy with it. It goes on smooth and it buildable to a good medium coverage. * This was my first time trying this make up brand and I a now a fan! Makeup is lightweight and comfortable to the skin. Is  100% true to skin match and buildable coverage, and also holds well in heat! * Run run RUN to get this foundation!!! I cant say enough good things about it! It gives such a radiant, skin like finish and doesnt feel heavy or greasy. Plus, the shades come in differnt formulas, depending on the shade range!!! * This is my 4th time buying this foundation and they changed the formula! It has a watery, runny consistency, whereas before it was a thicker consistency. The new formula still works just as well as the old one! Coverage is buildable without looking cakey (just make sure to blend with a damp sponge). I have rosacea and red acne marks & it covers flawlessly and still looks like my skin. 

I also have combo skin. I find this foundation to hydrate and also not accentuate my oils that i produce throughout the day. It's a perfect soft matte finish. * I get compliments whenever I wear this. it's a really good, light on the skin, natural finish foundation, but somehow still manages to have good coverage. It's very easy to blend into the skin, and wears great across the day. My absolute favorite thing about it though is that it has the best shade range and undertone range I've experienced. I'm a pale olive which is very hard to find foundation for, but this looks amazing on me. * This foundation of the game changer, so long wearing I work 10 to 12 hour days and it does not budge crack or flake. This is a Serum foundation so it is very watery but the coverage is absolutely amazing. I have never seen a Foundation blur the way this does. I have been mixing this foundation with the Youthforia primer for light days this combo makes it into a radiant tinted moisturizer."

I use it to lightly set my foundation and it transforms my face! I have also used it as a powder foundation for summer days and it is flawless! * This is the best powder foundation i have ever tried, i reach for this one over my high end one. Its my go to during the summer months. * Medium to full coverage. I like to carry it in my bag for touch ups because it covers the redness around the nose, i can cover up some my blemishes that peak out after wearing makeup all day etc * I use the shade Natural and I absolutely love this powder. i've used mine all the way to the pan and just restocked a new one. Literally the most beautiful blurring coverage, doesn't feel cakey or drying and my skin looks flawless. Great for on the go and quick touch ups. I usually hate the feeling of wearing heavy foundations and powders so once I found this it was over. Super breathable and comfortable and evens out my skin tone in a couple quick pass overs. I love this product. * Medium to high coverage, smoothing, non-comedogenic. Its a bit hard to shade match. I use Soft Tan in this powder and Nars Valencia, Lisa Eldridge 19, Estee Lauder 4w1. * This was my favorite foundation for everyday wear until recently. It is the best color match I've found and so easy to use. However, as others have stated, my last two orders have fallen apart into unusable powder within a few uses. Super bummed. * I've used this for a couple of years always carrying one in my purse. My last 3 have broken easily. The last one within a week!
Otherwise I like the product itself but once it breaks it's harder to use, and inconvenient."

It does not settle in my lines; it actually plumps my skin (hyaluronic acid üôåüèªü©µüëèüèªü§©) and gives a flawless finish. I also have extremely sensitive skin and my face does not react to this at all. It seems a lot of brands are now incorporating good skincare ingredients in foundations and this one is a winner! ü•áüôåüèªüëèüèª * Went tried on my arm but ,when I put on face was way to dark for it.
But this is my first time ever using anything on my face so I'm  learning baby steps. * I'm over 50, have fair, neutral, combination skin with especially dry cheeks, redness, and texture. This foundation seemed to cover the redness fine but it faded within about 2 hours of wear. It settled in my fine lines and looked, for lack of a better word, gritty. No fragrance but does have an unpleasant chemical smell. It's a no for me. (Not Revlon's fault but the color-finding function led me to 117 Light Beige, which was the right depth level but pulled warm on me.) * the most skinlike finish of any drugstore product I've ever found. it has good coverage, wears comfortably on the skin, and doesn't crease or transfer if you set and prep correctly. it feels like the $50-$70 foundations i used to wear and the price is unbeatable. 10/10 * What an incredible skin loving foundation. After 2 weeks of using I'm noticing a more even skin tone, my fine lines are disappearing, and my skin feels nourished. I love this for spring/ summer! I prefer it without primer as I notice I get the most benefit that way. I do set with a non-talc powder and Milani setting spray. It truly looks like skin if you get the right shade! * When set properly, this foundation lasts all day, looks like skin, and never cakes or clings to dry patches. It looks and feels expensive on the skin, and I'd pick this over my Lancome for coverage anyway. It can be a bit too dewy if you don't do proper skin prep, but with the right primer and setting powder, it's perfect üëå * This is an AMAZING foundation. The coverage is perfection. It's dewy, has great ingredients, and I absolutely love it on my very sensitive skin. I have been using this since it was introduced to the Revlon line and my hope is that this will never discontinue. ü§û I have used only high-end foundations in the past before trying this foundation and this one is a clear winner. üôåüèªü©∑üòª"

It's very sheer which is nice but it really oxidizes in the skin so badly and clogs your pores. * Wanted to give this a try, one of the girls in the store recommended it for me saying its a great product. I tried it it was horrible, barely any coverage, dried very weird, and when i touched or wiped my hand over my face it was like pieces of it were coming off. I didnt even put alot on. Disappointed and would not recommend. * I have been on the hunt for a tinted moisturizer. Saw this tinted serum & based on the reviews wanted to try it out. Came in today and it was such a let down! Super watery and hss no coverage at all. I tried applying it with a beuty blender did not work, a brush was worse, ended up apllying it with my hands like i would a serum but its super patchy and hard to blend. Just a no jn my opinion, save your money snd try the purlesse tinted moisturizer with spf instead. Inwas trying to love this product in reolacement of my purlesse thats now $40, since this is more affordable but you def get what you pay for. * This product has the sheer tint I was wanting but was hard to blend. Can look patchy if it dries before blending. I try to work fast. I like how my skin feels afterwards, especially my neck. * literally so bad * This product has a lot of bad reviews but it was on sale so i decided to try it. I actually really like it!

It wasn't too far from my skincolor so it wasn't much of a problem for me. I would rebuy a darker shade next time. I loved this product much more than I expected tbh. I'm not a big fan of heavy makeup/skincare and this felt lightweight enough for me to us it as my foundation. It feels nice throughout the day but will get patchy as well. * I love how it feels. I am 52 with mature combination skin. It wears well and last all day at the office. * This sucked alllllll the moisture out of my skin in a matter of hours!! I can see how it would work and look beautiful on someone with the right skin match for it, but my skin really just did not agree. My skin is still burning. * I expected this to be much lighter coverage than what it is; a heavy, thick foundation that made my skin feel like it couldn't breathe. 

The color was also much lighter than expected although it was truly neutral, which is a nice switch from most makeup that leans (and oxidizes) peach or orange. * The color match was okay, i reeeaaally wanted to love it but the inly thing is it made me break out that very same day /: i honestly loved the way it looked though! Light weight & looks pretty natural, nothing too dramatic. For my acne prone gals, i wouldnt leave this on alllll day, maybe for like some hours (less than 8 hours per say) i would buy again tbh but i just wouldn't recommend to wear it allll day like i did to the point it made me grow blind pimples (the worst) it looks very nice with setting powder! Doesnt get too oily (with setting powder) maybe my forehead looked more oily, my nose was oily but not as bad as my forehead (nothing toooo crazy) * This has a pretty finish, it looks natural and doesn't make my dry spots stand out so much. It's light weight and the color match is decent. There's no fragrance but it does have that drugstore foundation scent to it, it fades after a while though. It's quite nice. I'm 46, light skinned, freckled redhead with super sensitive dry skin. I wear the shade 209 Buff Beige (MAC NC20-ish/Wet N Wild tinted hydrator Fair/Hourglass Immaculate Shell/Haus Labs #100) * I've had mixed results with skin tints, I figure i would try this and it was on sale.  It does have a serum consistency and is somewhat runny.  I had a bit of tough time figuring out my shade., buff beige is a tad too light for my light medium skin right now. I mixed it with some bronzing drops and it helped. the finish is very beautiful and it blends so easily.  I use some primer in my oily areas and some setting powder in my tzone and it stays on and looking nice all day.  I may try to pick up another color to get a better match for my skin but with bronzer it looks nice."

I work in a cooler all day so trust this helps my skin! * I will say that I have used this product in the past. Its not too bad for the price of the product. However, the coverage is very light and not really buildable. Although, I do like how it gives a somewhat dewy effect. I also like how it has clean ingredients! So if you like dewy foundation, light coverage, and clean ingredients then this product might be for you. * I rarely wear foundation, largely because I hate how heavy it feels on my face, and I also love my freckles and foundations tend to cover them. I bought this out of curiosity and I'm surprisingly happy with the result! It's a pretty watery consistency, but that means A) a little goes a long way, especially when applied with a foundation brush, and B) it feels so light on my face!! It evened out my skin tone (as someone with vitiligo, this is always a big win!!) without totally covering my freckles. It looks super natural, too. I appreciate the price for the amount of product and the fact that it has no scent. 

The one con for me is that my nose felt kind of greasy a few hours later‚Äîbut the rest of my face felt pretty dry, so that could just be my overactive pores LOL.

For reference, I am very pale (and I have vitiligo). I'm using shade 520- Fair. * It smelt soooo bad bro, i put it on twice, once to try and another to actually go out and then when i did it to go out it started peeling and looked SOOOOO cakey, like cakier than cakey. It smells TERRIBLE, when i was applying it i had to hurry since it smelt sooo bad, i can even explain fbe scent, but its just plain terrible, dont recommend * As I enter my mid-twenties, I've transitioned from the thick, full-coverage foundations of my adolescence to more lightweight and natural finishes. I bought this with the hopes of it being a bit more full coverage than a regular tinted moisturizer.

The color match is great, no quarrels there. It is also a great base for makeup and blends very smoothly with a beauty blender. I am, however, disappointed in the coverage. It is a very sheer foundation - it mostly just does color correction and levels out skin color. It does not do much for acne scars or dark circles. Also make sure to exfoliate and moisturize, as this will cling to dry patches. It also seems to fade a bit throughout the day.

Overall, it's a decent tinted moisturizer. Look elsewhere for lightweight with coverage. * Both my teens use this and love it. Provides a good light coverage without to much of a makeup look. * The sheerest tinted moisturizer i have. On good rosacea days i can wear this over light concealer. It feels lightweight because it is super runny."

It also looks a bit cakey but i highly recomend spraying do we setting spray onto your brush/sponge, and then blending out. * I normally wear Estee stay matte foundation but I was out and until it arrived I needed something in the meantime. I wore this out, was standing in the parking lot talking to my friends and some random lady walked up to us and said ""sorry to interupt but I just have to tell you, you are stunning"" ( she was talking to me) And then she walked off. I was never told that when I wore the Estee! What the heck, this stuff is GOLD. * I have been using this foundation for 5 years now. I will say it is not full coverage but it is buildable. This foundation feels so lightweight & it gives such a natural look. I've tried other foundations but always come back to this one cause its just so good! I tend to have an oily T-zone & everywhere else is pretty much dry but this foundation doesn't ever really cake or flake on me. I 100% recommend this foundation for an everyday natural look! * I love this foundation! it's affordable and stays on all throughout the work day * this foundation is surprisingly good for the price. it's buildable, smooth, and has a nice matte but natural finish. it flaked on my chin area after a few hours, but that could be my skin type. * Love this for my combo skin. I'm not extremely oily but I needed something that would actually last throughout the day without needing to powder by midday. I actually like it better than the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I am shade 090 in Lancome but have not been able to find a good color match as 090 is too light and the next shades are too dark and orange. I have very fair neutral skin. I prefer how the covergirl looks, it is very smooth with slightly better coverage, and L20 is a great shade and a closer match than the Lancome (maybe L20 is a dash too light but it looks perfect after bronzer). It gives a natural matte finish that doesn't cling or look cakey. Works well on my middle-age skin with fine lines. Has great medium-full coverage. Highly recommend! * I really love this foundation and I will continue to purchase it! Affordable and covers well."

WAIT! but don't stop reading because there is a flaw. the foundation goes on very dry unlike other foundations which glide smoothly across the face. hope this helps. * I have to admit, I like this better than higher end makeup * The foundation seperates and it is not blendable. I have to use lots of concealer to look better. * that's the shade range‚Ä¶ horrible * I typically go straight to MAC when purchasing foundation. I purchased this foundation and I waa impressed. I wanted to try a new product that is inexpensive and matched my complexion. Now, I find myself going in Ulta just to see if they have restocked. Even when I sweat, the makeup still looks flawless. I am so excited about this foundation and feel like my appearance has been enhanced due to formula!! Will continue to buy more! * This foundation has blown me away. I don't understand the negative reviews. It is a little runny, so shaking the bottle well beforehand is a must. But the coverage is fantastic. It dries down to a semi matte finish, doesn't accentuate texture, doesn't cling to my dry spots, nor does it make me  too oily (I have combo skin). It holds up in heat and humidity! The shade range may run a little light. I got the medium neutral thinking it would be good for when I self tan, but it actually somehow works even when I haven't tanned. Its lightly fragranced but the scent doesnt linger. Overall a great product and I keep reaching for it. Will definitely repurchase - it outperforms more expensive foundations. * My new favorite"

But this is noy for dry skin. * It broke the second I tapped my brush on it. Then it was impossible to blend out on my face and ruined my makeup ): * I love this powder this is the best powder that I have discovered as of lately. Elf kills it with all the products they release but this is top tier. * I really wanted to like this product, but even though I moisturize my skin, it leaves randow streaks on my face, as if i applied it with a paint brush. And leaves weird marks on my nose that I cant blend out and have to literally use my nails to scratch off. I have oily skin and never experienced this with a powder foundation. * I have fair skin and got the recommended color. It's too yellow for me and honestly isn't as good as the dermablend camo. I only got it because I can't find the dermablend camo anywhere. This doesn't stay on my skin very well and rubs off so easily. * I am 39 years old, and I have struggled to find a powder foundation that would work for my combo skin, I have spent tons of money, looked high and low, and have never been happy with anything that I found in the past. I could not believe how well, this held up for me! I am 39 years old and I had a baby nine months ago and don't have much time to do my make up but I still wanna look half decent when I have to go out of the house and this is quick and easy and effortless, I highly recommend this to anybody who cannot seem to find a powder foundation that works for them, maybe you might meet your match with this one. I do use the little sponge that comes with the powder because it works for me and I don't want to try to mess withthe system lol. * If your ever going for a simple quick look thsi is the foundation powder to use, the shade match is incredible accurate,decent coverage for a sinple quick look. I definitely recommend!!"

It's too heavy for me to wear every day, but I worked an event yesterday in 100-degree heat (Georgia) and it didn't budge or separate as long as I blotted my face. Not sure I'll buy or wear all the time, but it's good to have on hand when I need it! * I dont know if the tube i bougnt was defective, but WOW is this foundation awful. Its SO THICK in texture and sits right on top of my pores, accentuating them while it refuses to blend. Its so greasy i cant even wash it off my hands unless i use dish soap. Despite having the texture of oil paint, somehow the coverage is also fairly sheer??? How!! The only positive thing i can say is that it was cheap. * Have purchased this foundation twice already & always gets compliments on it! Super full coverage and buildable! Have yet to find my right shade but just mix it with other ones, so no complaints really. Would reccomend if you have oily skin. * I usually get the Fair to Medium Light! It doesn't take much and it lasts all day! * Wrong shade.  Salespeople were not at all helpful - Stock very low. * This Foundation is thick and applies good coverage but it stinks really bad like almost like it's made with cow manure or something.

You dont have to use a lot and literally your face is flawless. One of the things i love about this product is it doesnt dry out your skin. I got the shade neutral 25 and id say that its a mix of fair and tan. I also really love the application part of it, the wand is really nice!!! * Covers a lot without having to apply a ton. Love the application wand * I love this foundation I find myself reaching for it more  often than the others. it's not drying, not greasy,  the coverage looks like my skin but glowy, and not cakey. The kiko Milano powder is awesome too for baking BTW. This foundation is way very similar to TF Born this way foundation, (but not as greasy) kiko milano is underrated IMO. Yes I would recommend. * Good color and application, but really accentuates wrinkles. * I'm a fair to light olive undertone. I bought 2 shades, WB15 and WB25. WB25 was away too dark. I thought WB15 would match until I went in the sun it was Soo orange. disappointed. formula is good and coverage is great, just wish I can find a shade. * I like how this felt and it looked great.  Then i touched my face and prints! then this was be a matte look. I was shiny as all get out. Too much for something I would not let anyone else borrow * I wish the lightest shade was a bit lighter but is wearable.  Feels kind of heavy, you definitely feel like you're wearing foundation if not used sparingly.  Now for the good, makes a wonderful concealer, last all day and does not budge or break down.  If being used as a full face foundation, less is more with this, one drop blends out beautifully and covers up exactly what you need to cover...  Covers like a high-end concealer, last all day like a high-end foundation should last,  Definitely worth the spend..."

Blended like a dream, gorgeous satin finish, blurred imperfections, clean and fragrance free.  The color 1C was actually a cool tone, this new 1C is PEACH toned....very warm, and the formula change truly makes me sad....it's not the same. They ruined a perfect product. * I absolutely love this product! The smell is a bit strong and the application is a little off-putting, but it blends great and looks great! I found that instead of using a traditional primer like elf power grip, using a setting spray to prime made application easier and blending smoother. * My skin looked worse with this. Highlighying pores no matter how much or how many different methods i use. And shows every bump, dry patch, etc. its so weird. Like the opposite of why we wear makeup in the first place. So mad i was fooled that im writing a review * I have very fair and pink skin and have always had trouble finding foundations that match my tone, never mind work well on my oily/combination skin, but I will say that this one does a good job! I was nervous buying online without match testing, but I got the 1C and would say its a pretty good match for my skin tone. 

My pros for this are definitely: generaly matches my skin, works well with my oily/combination skin, it coming in a stick format is very convenient and mess free, stays on very well, looks natural, and doesnt make my skin feel gross

My cons would be: not the perfect match (wish the undertones were more p and that the shade was slightly lighter), can get a little cakey if i put too much on, and a little hard to blend. 

For context I've been wearing Too Faced Born this way foundation in the shade Snow for years now because it's the only foundation I've found that comes close to matching my skin, but I've always run into the same problem of not being able to apply the foundation too thick because then you can tell it's not a true match. Anyway, I would say overall thi one does a better job, has better ingredients, feels better on my skin, and is a good price point.

My last points would be dont let the 1 star reviews scare you, this foundation is very nice and as long as you use a wet sponge to apply and don't mind the mild scent of castor oil that fades in about 30 minutes :) * The old formula was amazing.  Shade 1C was a perfect cool tone as described.  This newer version is very peach in tone and no longer qualifies as cool toned.  So  if you are a fair, cool toned person...look elsewhere. * I have come back to this product again and again after trying other hydrating foundations that are too thin and messy or settle into pores. This is my favorite non-SPF foundation. It is like a natural version of cover girl compact makeup. It's vegetable oil based so it does smell like olive oil. But it's so nourishing and convenient with the solid stick. It smooths on well to a medium coverage and natural dewy finish that doesn't settle into my pores or cause breakouts for me. And with a light powder to set, it stays all day. I do wish they had lighter shades as the lightest warm (2W) is a bit dark for me in winter. But I'm a repeat customer of this good clean dry skin foundation option. * This brand is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I live in the desert and ingredients like hyaluronic acid just pull the water out of your skin because there's no water in the air here. It seemed like every make up and skincare brand hopped on that train and I couldn't find anything for my skin (dry) and climate type. I hope they never change the formula! I'm almost 30 and I'm starting to get crows ft etc and this really does a great job of camouflage without settling in any wrinkles."

There is no good reason for testing on animals and there are plenty of good products available which ARE CRUELTY FREE too. * I purchased this on a whim as i saw it on sale. I received it at the same time another package with the new Prada foundation came in, and I'm shocked that i like the Lorac foundation more than the Prada!  I applied this with my Hourglass foundation brush as the formula is quite thin amd it went on beautifully. Its so smooth and the finish really is a soft matte. It seems to be very long lasting as well. My first favorite foundation of the year. * I finally got my hands on this foundation and I wore it and loved it right away! I will say if you're sensitive to smells it does smell like paint but it will fade. This foundations lasts all day and blurred my acne scared skin & pores. obsessed! * Lorac left no choice but to select this when they quit making the PoreFection foundation.  This has no sunscreen and it has an odor similar to molasses. I use it because it doesn't break my face out. * I love it one of the reasons I love it is because it doesn't crease and settle in my  lines and it's very very hard to find products they don't do that. I can't get over the coverage when I first tried it I was so skeptical, because it is runny and well, it just didn't seem like it was gonna be that great‚Ä¶! And it is in my opinion‚Ä¶  To apply it I use a beauty blender and it goes on amazing and for me honestly a little bit goes a long way. ‚Ä¶ I have large pores texturize skin, but yet this one seems to work good for me and not feel too heavy.‚Ä¶ I wouldn't say it's totally water resistant, but good enough because let me tell you I've cried while having it on and it does not streak not at all at least not for me and like I said,  I'm almost 46 years old. I'm a 45 year old woman so it's been a struggle for me and I know other people have been saying a lot of different things then I am saying, but I know for me personally it is one of my favorites and always will be! And I highly recommend for more mature skin‚Ä¶ I really really do ‚Ä¶ I have used a brush with it before and it does work good as well. Not a matte either. Just a beautiful natural finish not too dewy. Put it to you this way whenever I use the Lorac foundation, I always get compliments oh, and before I forget, it does not crease on my eyelids, and that is one of my biggest pet peeves ever üòÇ. * Since the perfection foundation was discontinued I thought this pro version would somehow be better. It is not. It is very heavy coverage and cakes on. It truely smells like maple syrup. Laura Mercier makes a tinted moisturizer w SPF that is more like porefection formerly by Lorac. * I HATE this foundation.  I used the lorac sheer porefection foundation foe years. when it was discontinued I was upset but thought I would give this new product a try.  I used a primer under. I used an applicator sponge. it is terrible. it is thick. I was hoping this would equate to better coverage.  no such luck. it settles into pores and fine lines. it looks chalky on the skin. it transfers easily. I HATE this foundation.  üòí"

I don't think this is one of them.  It's the old school sort--the kind that feels very waxy.  If you have dry skin, you will not be pleased.  It's very hard to get the finish to look good, and even harder to get it to stay looking good.  It's probably not going to save you time or make your life easier on the go. * I am blown away by how amazing this stick foundation is!! It gives a barely there feeling which i love. It does not settle into fine lines and stays on all day. Can't wait to try more stuff from the brand!!! * This stick goes on sooo smoothly! Absolutely love the consistency of this makeup! My skin looked like a barely there makeup look, exactly what i was going for. Definitely need to extend the shade range of this makeup but other than that this stuff is amazing!! * great coverage for my skin tone and felt smooth.  please add more skin tones so all people can have it. * this shade range has every type of tone for lighter skin but for 1 dark complexion do better * I honestly dont unserstand why people who've never tried this give it a low rating due to the shade range. This is an Italian owned brand. Majority of the population is olive, light to medium skintones. Many of them/us have a hard time finding our shades. Go try Fenty Beauty if you dont like it. Anyways, this is fantastic. Super blendable and looks smooth on my texture. * the shade range is disgusting. its not like italy is a sheltered country or anything, many POC reside there. darker women, men, and all in between deserve to have products that fit their skin too. do better."

This one is up there with the more high end serum foundations in every way but without the crazy price tag. It is sheer - exactly what I like! - and blends like a dream. It has staying power and flattering shades. A little goes a long way. It plays well with other products both cream and powder. No moisturizer needed as it is very hydrating - my dry mature skin drinks this up and loves it! Very happy! * I've got combination skin with an oily t-zone and dry on my forehead and underneath my eyes, this doesn't bring any of this texture out! It's light coverage which I like for daily wear and for hot days. * It's so light! Def what I was looking for. Just a psa to anyone who wants to buy this, I'd suggest buying at AT THE store because I ordered it and received it with the product spilled. Still product in the bottle, but I for some reason can't put it sideways or it leaks. So if you order it online, be aware either the bottle is just awful or it broke while it was shipping to me. 
Other than that it's a wonderful product * I have used way too many foundations from luxury to drug store and this is by far the one I always want to reach for and have a back up. I have to force myself to use other foundations. I have normal to dry skin with some hyperpigmentation and prefer light coverage foundations that looks like skin. I use a smoothing primer in my pore areas, do two pumps with a drop of oil, dab it onto my skin and blend with a brush and this always makes my skin look absolutely flawless. No caking around my nose or forehead areas. Throughout the day, it continues to melt into my skin and look better and better. I can imagine this wouldnt be ideal with those with oily skin or who want more coverage, but for me this is the gold standard and what I put all of my other foundations/skin tints against. * I think you would have to have perfect skin to like this. Absolutely no coverage. Your face just looks wet. * My makeup aesthetic goals are ""awake, and not languishing away from consumption"", and this foundation is great for that. Sheer, doesn't settle into fine lines, leaves my skin smooth and hydrated and flawless. Add a quick dab of blush and mascara and boom, people stop asking me if I've been ill."

Creamy, spreads nicely (I use a brush), nice colour matching (I consider myself a medium brown skin colour). Overall great product! * I cannot say enough GOOD THINGS about this CC cream. There comes the point when foundation is out, and CC cream is in, and I am pleased with this product's color choices, smooth texture, and luminescence. I mix two shades and apply the first color as a primer. This CC cream doubles as my concealer; it's that easy to apply. * This product: separates BADLY and doe not blend well at all; Smells weird and chemical-y; offers VERY little coverage, even for a CC cream, and is overpriced because of all these factors. Positives: it makes skin glowy and has SPF. I wouldn't buy this personally - Pacifica's skincare and fragrance are AMAZING, but makeup seems to be a weak point. * This product came out separated.

It is a great product for the price. * I have purchased this product before and I liked it. This time the product was used. It had a finger smudge print on it when l opened it and the sponge applicator had make all on one side. I ended up purchasing something else at another store. * First, note this has the ingredients that Danessa Myricks uses for her foundation at an affordable cost. This provides a great shade match, makes skin look healthy and even, easy to take with you and stays on even if you sweat. The magnesium carbonate in the formula absolutely is wonderful for sweaty moments. I just find you can't really apply it with anything other than a sponge. Brushes with dense round tops don't pick it up well, as nothing else does. If you don't want to buy a beauty sponge you'll be fine to use the one it comes with. * Great shade for Hispanic women. * Too dark/matched my hand-too dark for my face * My mom loves this foundation and looks forward to trying more products from the line"

But if your skin is pretty smooth it works great, only issue I ran into was dry skin patches but was an easy fix with a moisturizer underneath. I would definitely buy again. I usually use IT cosmetics foundation powder, but actually prefer this one for the price. * It wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't agree with my skin or skincare. It did end up looking cakey/separated after about 2 hours. * Got this on a whim since it was affordable. I needed a pressed powder to add to my collection since my favorite loose powder is from wet n wild (the banana brightening one). But this looks fine on around the face but TERRIBLE under the eyes. I dont want to return so i will use it around the face and avoid the undereyes. * Got this hoping to use as a brightening powder after setting. It looks horrible under the eye and emphasizes texture and dryness I never noticed before. I've tried using it on it's own with a powder puff or as a finishing powder with a small brush to brighten. Never had this problem with other powders. I'm 18 but I have oily, slightly textured skin and fine lines under my eyes. Even on other parts of my face I find it difficult to blend. I would return this but it works surprisingly well as eyeshadow (when paired with other eyeshadows). I'm assuming makeup returns get trashed. My favorite powders are the Maybelline Fit Me (loose and pressed). I'm trying to find vegan/cruelty free alternatives and so far the Nyx Can't Stop Won't Stop has been my closet find to the Fit Me pressed powder. This is nothing like the Fit Me pressed powder. * I purchase this as a setting powder and although I like it; it was the wrong shade. * Was so happy to try this and received it broken in the mail. Dissapointing."

All of my friends, family members, and coworkers inquire about the foundation I use, and I have to share the link often. * Great foundation for the price. And it has spf! * Matched me perfectly.

Isnt all foundation tinted""? Maybe try tinted moisturizer * Light and hydrating product that evens out dull skin without looking heavy! Great for looking put together on minimal makeup days. * The coverage of this bad boy is wat too light to be called a foundation, but it doesnt have any skin care benefits which is I guess why they can't call it BB cream. It's refreshing to have a product with light coverage and a natural finish instead of dewy. Great for no makeup makeup days. * I found the Tawny shade of L.A. Girl Tinted Foundation in my local Ulta's clearance section and figured I'd give it a try. When I got home, I used Ulta's shade matcher and it told me I was really Warm Sand in this product (based off entering Ginger for bareMineral's COMPLEXION RESCUE Tinted Moisturizer Mineral SPF 30). Warm Sand perfectly matches my skin right now during the winter. I'll try Tawny again in the spring/summer, but it was a close match too. I love how lightweight this product feels and how easy it is to apply ‚Äî I dot it on right from the tube and the dab/blend with a lightly moist makeup sponge. It looks just slightly dewy but doesn't feel overly wet or sticky. It also works well under my bareMinerals BAREPRO 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation if I want to look more made up, but between the price and its natural look when used solo, it fits well with my minimalist approach to makeup. * I am 66 years old. It settled into my wrinkles and emphasized them.  Very sheer coverage. Not a good choice for me. * This is amazingggg!! it's creamy and dries so you don't need any powder, the finish is a natural satin finish and i have dry skin NC42 and the tan is perfection! * I love this foundation its a good one if you're looking for an affordable foundation thats light to medium coverage. I have pink on my cheeks and this covers it just enoiggt to not be seen. You cant beat that for the price."

If unsure, go a bit darker than normal. * I ordered 2W - Warm light - and it was almost white, so light and clearly defective. It did absolutely nothing other than make me have a Casper look. It is so sheer I can't imagine it doing anything even if it was the correct color.  I contacted Well People, I thought they should know how bad the product was, and they didn't care. * W3ll people... we need to talk about the shade range. People with darker skin tones like makeup too yet the shade range completely excludes anyone beyond tan. Thankfully the darkest shade works for me so I enjoy the product but it's hard to get behind a brand that doesn't give darker skintones a thought. * I was really hoping this product would work for me but it didn't. I found the baked foundation to be much more drying than other pressed powders I've previously used. Felt like it didn't go on well and had horrible coverage. Will not be buying again. * Takes forever to build up. Not for anyone who wants medium to full coverage. Light to medium at best. * Honestly if you're looking for a foundation to take a chance on.. this is definitely it. I'm not sure why I even chose to buy this but I love it!! I use it over concealer and it evens out my skin tone perfectly. Also does not make me look too orangey or cakey. * Just meh"

It was so easy to apply, felt nice on my skin, looks natural and I think m10 is my shade - it is spot on (for my beautiful summer complexion ) I'm excited to have found Mented! not a con for me, because i don't choose a makeup to smell good, but definitely seems like fragrance wasn't added.

I have pretty dry sky so I know to add a moisturizer before applying this. I am not saying this drying‚Ä¶but makeup ondry skin can appear patchy * This product feels and looks like you have no product on. * I have searched for the perfect match years! So excited to have finally found a shade so spot on with my skin tone that it's almost scary. The stick foundation is easy to apply, blends well and leaves me a great natural glow. * Looked awful on me. Horrible on oily skin and def dont get if you have light skin. This foundation isnt made for light skin tones which sucks. * Perfect match almost feels like a tinted moisturizer. I'm oily so I still need a powder but for stick makeup it goes on smooth and doesn't run off. I'm sold * Okay so hear me out.. the color match to my skin is amazing!!! it blended beautifully. However, I have combo oily skin and nothing could have prepared me for how shiny and oily this foundation is. This is not a matte foundation so beware!! * Hidden Gem hands down. I have been looking for a good foundation in general for a few years now, I went high end low end drugstore I went tinted moisturizer to full coverage and non did what I actually wanted. I love make up but finding a good foundation for my oily skin that wont force me to re touch (which I'm horrible at by the way, always makes it worse) was close to impossible without making me feel like I have pounds of make up on especially for work. I had tried the Hourglass foundation stick which was highly rated and felt very chalky on my skin. I did a search of stick foundations and came across this one. I am the lightest shade in this line and am on my way to re up for a 3rd time! I have never purchased 1 item more than once since they end up not working out for a while. The coverage is amazing from one layer to a 2 layers if I want a fuller look. It glides on like butter on my skin  and gives me a glow without an oily look if that makes sense. I rarely have to completely set my face because it sets so nice on its own and will literally last me over 9 hours without any cracks or separation and looks like I just applied it minutes ago. It makes my face feel hydrated and not like I'm wearing loads of make up. This is a long review and I never leave a review but I am truly in love with this foundation! I am so thankful for this brand because I am the in between when it comes to make up, I'm a semy fare complexion with neutral undertones. Many lines have a Yellow undertone or an olive undertone which makes me look washed out. This is truly a bang for your buck and will leave your make up looking flawless."

It is a bit hard to use to start with but once you figure it out it's very nice.  Good for older and younger skin.  I'm 64 and it's the best I've ever used. * This foundation is perfect for evening out skin tone without making it look like you painted your make up on. I really love pairing it with cream contour and cream blush, and then just setting it with a setting spray- it gives a gorgeous dewy finish. You can set it with powder to make it a little more long lasting too. I always try to catch it on sale. I think having a gorgeous light coverage foundation like this is perfect for an interview, meeting someone new, or embracing your natural beauty! Its made me feel so much more confident in my own skin. * The origin to my villain story. I listened to an ULTA employee, first foundation for my high school homecoming. Three days later I broke out, having clear skin all my life. Ever since, it never stopped. I had to go on meds to cure my acne. Don't use. * I used to use the old face and body without the radiance and always loved it so im not surprised I love the new version especially because I like more of a sheen/glow to my skin. This is a very sheer coverage foundation but is buildable if you want a little more coverage. Also I can apply this over my skincare without it pilling! * I never tried the original face and body. Honestly, I was never interested in this foundation until I started watching Miss Megan Robinson on tik tok. Seriously you NEED to follow her!! I generally have oily skin. It's been a lot more calm, and a lot less oily after I got rid of all the actives, and JUST started washing, toning, and using AN OIL (I know right, but it's true, oil loves oil, using an oil will keep your skin from producing a lot of oil) I can now wear this foundation confidently, and it is BEAUTIFUL!! It's friction activated so I suggest applying with fingers and rubbing it in so you can start to feel the ""gripping and thickening"" action that happens with this foundation(which is the best most fun part for me). The coverage is obviously light but it looks like perfected skin. Only the best things are peeking through. Everything blends nicely on top, and I mean EVERYTHING, from all different brands. It wears great too and looks even better as the day goes on. Its softly radiant and skin like if you powder (which I still do) and if you don't you'll look like a freshly hot glazed donut (some people like that, some people don't) I get the hype of this foundation and dare I say it's made it into my top 5 line up!!?? Coming from an oily girl that is shocking. If you're wondering, I use the Danessa Myricks yummy skin balm in translucent as a primer, this foundation, all my other creams and liquids, and I set with Mac studio fix powder and one size setting spray. PERFECTED NATURAL RADIANT SKIN * Wear it everyday and have received unprovoked complements. * So light!  Perfect for summer and the heat.

It look so beautiful like natural skin! It doesn't dry matte, so definitely set it with powder. I'd say a little goes a long way! It last all day & still look beautiful even after a workout. The only areas that would slightly crease would be around my smile lines & chin but nothing crazy. I wish the foundation would be more available but it's so hard to find & the shade range isn't the best but overall 10/10 I would recommend! My closest shade is A05.5. I also tried mixing V05 & V04 to get my shade if anyone is wondering. I hope this helps.  :) * Coming from an Ulta Employee, after trying every foundation under the sun, this foundation makes my skin look FLAWLESS, airbrushed, smooth. I do have to set with a translucent loose powder because it is still a little tacky in my opinion. Shades are FANTASTIC. A02 matches me the closest; however if there was a slightly paler shade with a yellow undertone that would be my perfect match. I ordered A01 and A02 on YesStyle and to me 1 was almost darker than 2, but it may just be the undertones. ULTA PLEASE BRING THIS BACK. It took me over a week with express shipping on YS btw I paid $19 extra FYI In case anyone was going to order it, I think it ships from China. Idk what is in this foundation but  I want to buy every bottle just incase it ever gets discontinuedüòÖüò≠üò≠üò≠ * My relationship with foundation is a nightmare,I'm a brown skin girl with golden undertones in the summer and pale skin in the winter,without much prep this foundation matched me perfectly and stayed on ALL NIGHT,the a night of dancing üíïLOVE THIS STUFF * Please restock ASAP! This is my favorite foundation!! I literally bought 3 bottles because I have a feeling Ulta might discontinue this foundation...
 FYI- you can still find VDL on Yesstyle BUT it's NOT the same foundation. The one on Yesstyle has SPF & it has more of a dewy finish üò© * I hope Ulta is not going to stop selling this foundation. It is an amazing satin finish foundation. Looks flawless on the skin and makes blemished skin look smooth. Wears beautifully throughout the day and is full coverage. Highly recommend. FYI if they stop selling it at Ulta you can find it on YesStyle. * I bought this foundation in the color A06. I tend to have a hard time finding foundations because I am in the weird shade range where I'm typically between medium/tan and dark/deep in various brands. I have Neutral slightly golden/olive undertones and find that many brands get close but not perfectly my shade. Most times foundations are too golden (almost orange looking), too cool, exactly neutral when I need just a touch of yellow in the foundation, or they just skip my shade altogether. I was pleasantly surprised when this foundation was an exact match. I love the natural finish to this foundation. I have dehydrated combo skin that if not properly hydrated will get oily in the t-zone (mostly nose area) and will remain normal or slightly dry everywhere else. When I wear this for several hours my foundation goes from very natural to radiant but not oily as my t-zone starts to break into a bit of a shine. I really don't have anything bad to say about this foundation except because of the limited shade range there's a chance you may not find a good match depending on your skin tone and undertone. Hopefully Ulta continues to keep this foundation available. * I would describe this foundation on my skin as full coverage with a satin/slight dewy finish. I have acne prone skin with acne scars and this foundation covers everything without causing any texture. Long wearing and mask proof. Doesn't cause breakouts. Would recommend for various skin types."

The ""creamy"" title is very deceiving though. It's powder. And quite drying immediately on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this for aging skin whatsoever. Great product for on the go touch ups on oily skin. * I don't care for the sponge applicator because it really doesn't go on right, but I found that using a brush to apply is so much better and it goes on more evenly.  You can add more where needed without it looking blotchy.  I love it! Used the color Sienna * Goes smooth and cover some imperfections, but looks natural. Leaves your skin soft and beautiful. * Lightest shade, Ivory.  You MUST prep the skin with moisturizer, sunscreen and either CT Hollywood Flawless Filter or the Maybeline knockoff or a dewy primer or sunscreen.  Buff in with a brush after applying concealer where needed.  Use powder bronzer, blush and highlight and a setting spray.  It looked amazing on my 48 year old dry skin and lasted all day.  Not powdery, didn't settle in lines, let's your skin peek through (is light coverage).   I really love it. * I thought since it's called age perfect it would be a moisturizing creamy powder. Nope. It's super drying and I have combination oily skin not even dry. Feels horrible right on application You can feel the makeup. Didn't blur anything. I had to take it off within 10 mins of application. Don't buy this stuff. * I wanted to try a cream to powder foundation to try to cover some dark spots. 
This covered what I wanted. It does look a little dry after application but I'm oily so it looks more natural after a few hours. * I love the age rewind concealer and seen this after looking for a good powder foundation. it is a really creamy, finely milled powder. I don't think it's really pigmented but you get enough coverage to even everything out and in my opinion it really does blur. I use a flat top Kabuki brush to buff it in, slowly building up layers. I take product and tap it in where I need more coverage with a concealer brush. I find I get the most coverage this way. it's like your skin but better. gives you a nice natural finish and doesn't look cakey if you slowly buff and build. will be trying this as a setting powder for liquid since it blurs. it also doesn't make me breakout!"

Unfortunately, This product didn't work for my dry skin. And for the price I doesn't have great coverage. I don't see this product any different from any other pressed powder. Also, this powder has sparkles in it I guess to conceal how drying and powdery it makes the skin.. * I love this powder, my skin is dry but this powder always feels comfortable on, never adds any texture as other powders have for me in the past, def one of my fav powders * I LOVE this pressed powder! It takes away the look of shine and makes my skin look refined and even toned. I bought Ivory and it is the ideal shade for my skin tone, medium fair with pink undertones. It works well worn over concealer and foundation, or on its own. And, better still, it looks invisible and feels like nothing on skin! The mirrored compact is the perfect size for taking on the go and it even comes with an applicator sponge on a clear, hinged divider inside. Hynt thought of everything with this pressed powder! I will definitely buy again:) * I've always been reluctant to wear powder - most of the time I end up looking cake-y. This finishing powder is a game changer - so easy to apply and bonus, the packaging is so adorable! But more importantly my skin looks so velvety and super plump, definitely will be coming back for more when I'm through with this! * Love using this powder in-between zoom meetings to touch up my skin. Just gives me a more even/finished and natural look * One of my favorite products from Hynt * I used this foundation with the foam puff it came packaged with. Do not use with a brush, the powder is finely milled and will fall off your brush! I wore it over serum and moisturizer. My face got a little shiny throughout the day but that is common for me, as I have combination skin. I like that the coverage is buildable, I was able to apply two layers and achieved the coverage I was looking for. Best of all, the ingredients are natural and truly clean! No SLS, no parabens, no Lauryl Lysine, no Bismuth oxychloride! So happy Ulta is carrying this brand!"

I recommend performing a gentle face exfolation before bed time and removing any peach fuzz for any makeup aplication, not just this foundation. It makes a huge difference in aplication and appearance of the final look/finish.
It works best with the Vanish smoothing primer. (To smooth down the pores that every human being has) It is runny but extreamly pigmented. Do not use too much or it will look cakey.Best apply with a dense buffer brush (Morphe 444 is my favorite) and then press it in with a beauty blender. I use the professional Kryolan setting spray first, and then set it with a good powder.( Jeffree Star, Fenty or Kryolan powder) It holds for 14h even in humid Florida. Best foundation for events. It's best for normal/ combination skin. I wish they had more shades.
Unfortunately it just has been discontinued, tho the company has gave me insites that they are working on perfecting the formula and making a new foundation for combination/oily skin (they currently carry luminous foundations for normal/dry skin) * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * This product is so thin & runny! Like water consistency. I pumped one pump on my hand & it literally dripped off me. I shook the bottle so many times & it still remained runny. I gave it a try on my face because I wanted to give the foundation a chance but the product just settled right into any crevice it could. I could literally see wrinkles/lines I didn't even know I had. * I got this during a sale and was so excited to try my first Hourglass product. I followed the instructions and reviews and only used a very little amount. It brings out my pores horribly, dries down very weird and makes my skin dry, and even though it feels light on my skin my skin feels a tiny bit sticky, not something I usually experience with prestige brand foundations. This is a miss for me. * This foundation is very reminiscent of Marc Jacob's 'Remarcable' . Full coverage and matte with a pore filling matte primer underneath . The bad reviews are really just people who don't know how to apply makeup . * Words do not explain how buttery this foundation is I have dry to normal skin and it blends it two to three glides. Will never use another foundation"

I have combo oily skin and so far regardless of the primer or moisturizer this just doesn't look good and will break down. I've been using juvias place which I like ten times better and I don't have to try to make it work. This foundation also oxidizes orange..so not just a shade but it'll turn more orange as well. I'm gonna try to find something to mjx it with but I won't be purchasing again and wouldn't recommend it. * I have oily combo skin, and this foundation did not stand the test of time. It felt very heavy, and transferred with the slightest touch (with setting powder). Only a few hours in, and it was breaking apart on my face, highlighting even the slightest texture. My pores were literally drinking this product up. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a foundation, and could not wait to take it off. * I have combo skin, I use the Bobby brown moisturizer primer underneath and only use a tiny bit with a brush. Looks flawless!! Do not use to much product otherwise it will look cakey, if you need extra coverage apply only to specific area with smaller brush. * 32f (no active breakout/indented scars only on cheeks/combination skin)This foundation has the worst formula I have ever used on my skin. I tried two different primers underneath and tried it on it's own and it just refused to settle or smooth out. It creases badly and makes skin look dry and caked with very minimal use of the product that looked worse and worse if you tried to use even a tiny bit more. Powders and setting spray do nothing to help. I tried beauty blenders and brushes and neither made it better. I ended up going back to a trusty Revlon foundation that was way cheaper and a much better formula. Do not waste your money if you do not have perfect smooth skin. * I have sensitive skin with large amounts of rosacea and occasional eczema. This product covers my redness very well, and can many my dry areas seemingly disappear. Smashbox was also a line that came up multiple times during my search for products best for sensitive skin. * Maybe this just doesn't work with some skin types. I've given this several goes with different amounts of product and application techniques and it always manages to cake up and accentuate every pore after it's settled. I decided to give this one more go, applying after a glowy moisturizer that managed to save some of my other cakey products and it still had the same issues after setting for about 20 minutes. * It has perfect coverage,  a very little goes a long way.  Love the Matt finish I got.  Like  all foundations,  you have to prepare your skin before you applying anything to it.  Use a brush to apply.  I patted it on."
