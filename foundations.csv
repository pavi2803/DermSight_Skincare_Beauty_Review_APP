Since this product contains silicones, I used my silicone based sunscreen. The pairing resulted in an uneven distribution of pigment when you looked closely but wasnt very noticable far away. The foundation was very comfortable and wore well throughout the day. Using a mineral based sunscreen underneath gave a much better appearance. Just be careful about what is layered underneath. * Full coverage * Horrible! This foundation feels like sand paper and cakes right away. It is not possible to blend this and the coverage is very minimal. If you have any imperfection or texture on your face DO NOT USE!  
I wanted to love this product because I love the brand and it was actually a production I could use (due to allergies), buy sadly it went  right in the garbage. * I've repurchased this foundation twice. It is long wearing, and can easily be touched up with just your finger tips, no additional product. I had a long workday schedule this summer both indoor and outdoor. This foundation gave me coverage throughout the day. I touched up with my finger and a little pressed powder, good to go. I also spent one day getting wet and I still had the coverage there without cakiness. The trick is not to use too much product, I apply it using a beauty sponge. I just wish it came in more shades, the lighter shades give me a yellowish complexion. * I have oily skin and have had a hard time finding a foundation that doesn't slide down my face by lunch time. With proper skin prep and moisturization, this foundation works like a dream without the use of a primer or setting spray. During the summer set the eye brow area with translucent powder. My powder products also stick and blend with this foundation very well. * I went to about 30 concerts this spring and summer and this foundation lasted through every show! I'm naturally a sweaty girl and was concerned about finding a foundation that would last as I danced and sang my nights away and this foundation was it! Most days I would put it on the mornings before work and I never once had to touch it up or worry about it looking anything less than perfect by the end up the fun filled night. There were some days that I was so exhausted I'd just come home and fall asleep and when I woke up in the morning my face would look like I had just done my makeup. This is now and will always be my go to choice. * I have oily skin and thought it would fit me but it is so hard to blend it sets as soon as it touches your face will leave you patchy , I wear a face mask for work so I thought I'd try something new 0/10 this is the worst foundation I've ever used !"

It's medium coverage and not buildable, so for the little spots that I need a bit more, I dab on the Dior foundation stick. Such a natural look. Foundation is the only Dior product I own, but I recommend trying it. I can use much less product than other brands, imo it's the same price at the end and looks better. As mom said, you get what you pay for. * Got the shade 00n and it matches perfectly. Its a actual super pale foundation without looking like face paint! * First off I love this because of the shade match... I am a light medium olive, which is hard to find. This also gives a beautiful glow, I have dry skin .so I like it,  it doesn't settle into fine lines ... only problem is the transfer... it's awful if you have babies or toddlers.. of if your partner loves to cuddle.. it will transfer * The lady who was helping me was dead on. I had been previously sold a concealer/Foundation, which made me look orange, Monique picked the Perfect color For me,  I could not be happier! The Ulta I went to is located in the promenade Plaza located in Edgewater, New Jersey * This foundation is light, covers my flaws, and lasts 24 hrs. It does smudge off or get cakey. Dior products are the best@ * I don't understand what justifies the high price of this foundation. The color match was beautiful, but the TRANSFER! I have tried every primer, powder  and setting spray but this transfers on everything. And the smell is odd. * I wanted to love this foundation because I heard so many great things about it but I had to wash it off after 10 minutes because I had an allergic reaction to the fragrance in it."

I repurchased and i can say the formula hasnt changed. My makeup looks exactly the same 10 hours later as when i initially applied it. Amazing * Love this item. I'm an entertainer who uses a lot of makeup.Unfortunately, when I sweat, it's starts on my face. So, I require a full coverage matte finish foundation that can withstand sweat. Additionally, it goes on smoothly with a bush or a sponge. * Love the coverage this foundation gives me * I bought the product but I think I prefer the old formula.  The shade I have always worn was not available in any way, shape or form. But mostly, it was the consistency of the product which seemed watery and not as good coverage as the old. * I've been using this foundation for a few years before the reformulation and just started back up again this year. It's still a really good foundation and covers what I need it to. If I'm having a bad breakout though I do need some concealer but I keep coming back to this foundation because it really does make my skin look almost perfect. * I used this foundation for years. Has great coverage and looks so natural. I like to switch things up a bit sometimes so the last 3-4 times, I have bought IT cosmetics you're skin but better. I decided to go back to my favorite lancome foundation and I just used it for the first time and I had to take it off immediately!! My face was swelling up!!! My eyes are so swollen I can barley see. They must have changed the formula! Because this has never happened before!! * Unfortunately it broke me so bad. Ugh that's the worst. The consistency was light but made me feel gross and greasy. This foundation oxidizes badly too. So I'd look greasy and  shade darker/orangey throughout the day. It was recommended to me by a sales associate but unfortunately it's not for me."

I've been using their concealer and know my correct color but they want me to figure it out all over again if I want to try the foundation? Forget it. I'm buying neither. what a stupid waste of time. * Great product! * This is the second time purchasing this foundation and i absolutely love it! Skin looks so natural and really covers redness well! Highly recommend for natural everyday makeup use. * I honestly wanted to love this fondation because it blends nice and feels like nothing on my skin and when taking it off it really does feel like it improved my skin but it is NOT for oliy skin when first applied it looks heavenly but after an hour or two i look like the peanutbutter baby and it turns blotchy and pacthy for a bit i thought it was my other products but when i switched my foundation i didnt have that problem but i would still recommend this for my dry skin girlies because its skincare benefit is amazing * my skin looked flawless. Love it! Cant wait to try the concealer next * This is my new favorite foundation. I held out on buying NARS for a while mostly because of cost. But this product looks like SKIN and stays on all day * As someone with pale & dry skin, I often cannot find my perfect match. When I do find my perfect match, the foundation is usually very heavy and dries out my skin. Nars Light Reflecting Foundation FINALLY changed that for me - it covered all my redness and even my eyebags, but it still looked like my SKIN, and it felt like my skin as well. Only note is that you'll need three pumps for a light-medium coverage look, so don't purchase if you're in the market for a full beat. I adored this foundation so much, worth the money and would totally recommend."

Gave the new formula a try and omg. It sits on top of the skin. Its awful. Please bring back the old formual. * Ive never returned makeuo before but i will return this foundation. It flakes off immediately after applying. Applies patchy and uneven. Looks chalky. Terrible. Would not recommend * Bought this a while back before the formula change and i remember it being decent. Now it can get a little cakey if youre not careful, but it still gives the coverage I remember. If you have dry skin this foundation might be a little too dry for u. With my combo skin I have learned to prep my skin a certain way to get the results I want. * The matte formula is just not as good as the previous fluid fix. It accentuates any dry patches on the skin and gets cakey by end of the day. it just leaves you looking dry. I loved the previous formula that left a silky finish. now I have to find another foundation, bummer! * I used the naked skin foundation FOREVER UD discontinued it, just like all the other great products they had. It appears MAC is now doing the same. I stopped buying their other products since the change was noticeable in the now poor quality of their cult classic lipsticks and patchy shadows. Now they've changed the foundation too. I have combo, textured skin with acne and in my 30s.  This used to look flawless and match my skin almost perfectly. In the new formula it's 2 shades lighter than before. Only plus to this I can find is the built in pump now. Disappointed and bummed. on the hunt again * One of the sad people who religiously wore studio fix and had to purchase this new formula. It's better than I expected after reading recent reviews…but it is not the original formula obviously. I do not like change and hardly change items in my makeup routine so this was upsetting. I did have to go in store to find my new shade. NC20 is NOT the same as the new NC20. It's bright orange. I am now NC18. Not 100% happy with it. It does not match exactly as the old formula. I wear setting spray and loose mineral powder over my liquid foundation but I still felt oily after a few hours. More so than with the previous formula."

pros:
easy, quick to apply, pairs very well with the bare minerals mineral veil and primer, sponge works decently, generally good coverage and coloring, pretty skin perfecting. 

cons:
sometimes settles in creases, doesn't work as good for oily skin without primer/setting spray/setting powder, imo not a lot of product considering the price, some shades can be very orange looking so make sure to be very sure that you chose the right shade before buying. 

overall, i think it's a pretty good foundation. * I love this formula, color, texture, and who cares about the sponge you use a brush to apply. However, this lasts about a week! Very disappointing, too much money to be buying weekly. * I had to change my color cuz of a change in the color scheme & it was busted up due to shipping. * I genuinely love this product and am shocked to see the bad reviews. I use this product by itself and it looks really nice and Im very, very picky. I also have sensitive skin and this is amazing! My color is unfortunately hard to find which is a bummer. * Product is a little pricey And Ulta is usually picked over. Hard to get the color you want * Loved the powdery soft texture of the product on the pan but once swatched on my face, it made my face look very dry with a ""shine"" even worse, made my pores and thin lines stand out horribly!! I felt 10yrs older, I fell for the ""matte look"" description but this was a NOPE for me, returned the product right away. Really wanted to give this brand a chance but it didn't worked on me. * My makeup was broken upon arrival. Since I was out of foundation, have a new baby at home, and live an hour away from the nearest ulta I decided to try and make it work instead of returning. Each time I opened and closed the compact it got worse. Getting the sponge out of the bottom compartment became impossible after the 2nd time. After 3 days of using this product it is so broken and destroyed that it spills out everytime I open it and chunks fall out. Disappointed is an understatement."

Its a natural finish skinlike, not dewy not matte. the shade match is impeccable. Give it a try! * I am on the spectrum and precise product output means a lot to me because, otherwise, I have to talk myself out of not freaking out. My beauty products need to have a pump or they need to be easy for me to evenly count. I think in numbers. I love that the color shade works so well for me and thr matte finish really tames my oil/sebum throughout the day without collecting in my smile lines. I love that it layers well with other things. I didn't want to love Fenty Beauty. I was a skeptic and now I'm a believer. Thanks, RiRi! Keep up the good work! * Made me Break out baaaaddddd… The color match is SPOT ON which is something I have a very head time with, but I rather be a shade lighter or darker and not break out😓 * I've been hunting to find the perfect coverup or even decent coverup and I'm still hunting . A lot of these reviews must be fake because this coverup is terrible ! I tried it two different ways 1. Fresh clean face no moisturizer 2. Moisturized clean face and the results were the same . The coverup sits ontop of the face after one layer it didn't look like I even put anything on still pink cheeks it just sat on my nose and chin no coverage , I went up to 3 layers and same results . The color is like chalk white , I'm very fair with cool undertones and it's near face paint color and again zero coverage . I've been going through the more expensive brands and they've all been bad so far morphe and Anastasia have worked the best even over este lauder and Dior brand . I'm also a licensed cosmetologist for over a decade . * I didnt like this foundtion at all. When you put it on your face, it dries way too fast before you can blend it. It looks extremely cakey, patchy, and when it dries, it oxidizes and makes me look orange. My undertone is warm because my veins are green, so I dont have to wrong shade or undertone. It oxidizes too much and feels very heavy on the face. After a few hours, you have to blot and a lot of the product transfers to the tissue or blotting paper. Do not recommend ladies! * I love this product. It is nice and light and has full coverage on my face. The price is great from Ulta and it last me eight months definitely Recommend * I found a foundation that i can get use to. Its medium light on my face which I like. The 450 is a great match for me. I tried the 445 when i was in the store, i let it sit on my face it gave a more glowy warm olive color on my face. And the 450 gave a reddish golden brown on my face and it help cover my dark acne spots. I just love the matte finish because i attend to get oily in my T zone area. So i do use setting powder. I wear glasses so i have put setting powder on my face, because the glasses leave shiny print mark when I remove them. But overall its a great product. And the 450 last a long time."

This is my new favorite!! Light weight with good coverage. It feels wonderful on my skin. * The product looks amazing on and really gives you a glow. I got complimented by another lady saying that I had amazing skin, while wearing it. Downside: my eyes burn and tear up while wearing this. It also has a very strong smell of SPF so you smell like you're going to the beach. * This cc foundation is light weight, but covers flaws nicely. It did not settle in my fine lines and did not irritate my skin. I love that it has sunscreen in it, saving me time and money not spent on another step and product. * tried this product over a weekend. it broke my face out, caused lots of irritation, and never set. * I cammot rave about this enough! I never used to wear SPF although I knew how important it was for me to wear all year around; even more living in FL. Evey product that was anything like a skin tint of foundation with SPF irritated my skin. One day, I saw that they dropped the Nude Glow line & decided to give it a try. That was years ago & now I use it day & night. It's lightweight but provides great coverage! If you want to build up you can & it won't look cakey. You can use a face brush or sponge. Depending on the mood I use both or either or. 
I always get compliments on how beautiful my skin looks when I wear it. I use a hydrating primer & serum and to finish off a moisturizer before the CC. All water based products so it doesn't clash with the foundation. For reference, I am in my 30's, have dry sensitive skin. Have some light hypermintation. * This just breaks apart. Looks patchy. And wont set even with powder. I prep my skin the same way as I do when I use their other foundations and all of those look better and last longer."

I need to even put the redness and tone and not settle in the creases... Found the perfect shade for the first time ever. This is the answer! Easy to put on on the morning and isn't shiny. Win win win! * Love the coverage, texture, and overall wear * Had to stop using it after giving it a couple of tries. The smell was horrendous, and the foundation is so liquidy that my face felt wet all day, to the point I worried it was running down my face. * I've never had a makeup break my face out so bad.  I've used doublewear and I never had any issues, but this one was terrible.  The spf makes it so greasy and the smell is icky. * Absolutely love the ease of using this product and the results. Feels like you're wearing nothing at all, super easy to apply in minutes, and gives enough coverage without feeling caked on. I'm not a makeup person at all, but I'm so glad the store rep introduced me to this product. I have melasma and while it doesn't completely cover it, it does smooth out my coloring so it's no longer noticeable.

I also purchased the illuminating setting spray and that gave me the perfect. Dewy finish * It was very thick and cake like. Wasn't smooth. Also it was the wrong shade, too yellowy. * After Reading the comments i just wanna say i love  this foundation. However if u are not prepping your skin with a proper skincare regimen and a primer you will not get the application you desire. Thats with any foundation! Also if u have texture , acne or wrinkles be mindful no foundation is magic. Skincare is key for a decent look. Make up is not magic it doesn't make your flaws magically disappear. * I use this foundation all over and it has excellent coverage! I can even add a little more in spots that need it and they just disappear! My only complaint is for them to change the bottle. I am almost out of product, but i can tell there is soooo much more leftover on the sides of the bottle. The problem is that it's impossible to scrape it due to the doe foot applicator fitting through such a narrow hole."

Becuase of that, i don't have to use much of it so it isn't super drying on my dryer combo skin.

As for the color match, I happen to be able to find the best color match for my light olive skin in this line! I had to go in store to swatch the shades though. This brand's shades are tricky. The formula oxidizes too.

Ive never tried the old formula but so far i'm happy with the current one! * Love the quality and way it looks on my skin. * I love this foundation I've already gone through i bottle and got another one. It works great to cover up my massive pores and black heads. Cons id say is it settles into the undereye wrinkles so go easy on those spots and set with a podwer. I love because i have extremely oily skin and i still get oil but it reads more glowy then it does greasy. I get compliments on it constantly. * I used to love the old version of this product; it was my go-to. However, this new formulation is awful. I've been trying to work with it for two months now, and it just looks like garbage. It is patchy, streaky, and throws a bit orange. I've tried it with different primers and different brushes, but it's no use. Skip this product. * The new formula is orange and cakey. I will be returning asap and finding a new brand.

I love the buildable coverage and that it has no smell. 10/10 recommend! * No scent, finish is like skin, not matte or dewy but perfect for just a skin filtered look. The shade match was perfect and it blended out so well!! One of my new fav skin tints and feel super lucky to have gotten to try it! Coverage is light and buildable maybe to a lighter medium. Packaging is super cute!! * This has a beautiful finish to it. It's lightweight. I mix it with my moisturizer and it looks amazing on the skin. It's buildable if needed but I like it just with my moisturizer. The packaging is cute too and I don't smell anything when it's on. * Literally my favorite skin tint EVER * I love this foundation. Fenty did a great job— i have been out for a little while and finally repuechased it- i kept my original bottle so i would never forget the shade informstion. I ordered a new one, shade 4, it arrived today and is a completely different color. So now i need to go to the store abd shade match to what i need sunce the new formula is different. * If you are looking for a light weight makeup that gives you medium coverage I could not recommend something more. My skin still looks like skin. The shades blend effortlessly. Could not recommended a product enough. Especially for everyday wear! * I love this skin tint! As i've gotten older I definitely prefer something more lightweight than a full coverage foundation. This offers just the right amount of coverage without feeling to heavy. My skin is also pretty oily so I love the fact that this skin tint isn't dewey and has a soft matte more natural finish. Many skin tints you see on the market are overly dewey which doesn't work for oily skin. I also really enjoy the packaging as its pretty compact which makes it easy to travel with."

I am mid-40s with ""good"" skin that is on the drier side due to autoimmune disease. I have plenty of fine lines, hereditary dark circles, and a skin tone that is difficult to match. This foundation checks all my boxes: light-medium coverage, serum texture, not drying, and on top of that, I dont even need to use undereye concealer with this. It works best for me to just use the foundation. It's amazing. I dont know what else to say about it except that now Morphe will probably discontinue it since it's my holy grail. As far as the tough color match, I have a very cool undertone but not extremely fair skin (more of a medium). Everything always looks yellow on me. This has a great match. It also does a gold job of covering rosacea. I don't have to set it with powder if I don't want to. 

Other foundations I've used and liked, to a lesser degree: 
Ilia Skin Tint (needs way more setting than this does) 
Clinique Even Better Makeup 
Dr. Jart BB cream
Missha BB cream * The foundation is pretty good, full coverage and lasted without getting cakey. But when it arrived in the mail it was like the lid was loose and it was leaking. I tightened it and cleaned it before putting it in my makeup bag. It still leaks around the sides and gets all over my other make up in my bag! Not sure if mine was just defective or if anyone else is having this problem * Absolutely love it!  Just what I was looking for...Perfect coverage. * This is such an underated foundation. I have combination dry skin. I do not use cream blush or bronzer. Im a powder type of girl so I always set with powder then hydrating setting spray for the dew look without being grease if that makes sense. This foundation doesnt need a primer, it looks better without . Last all day and it is smooth . One of my favorite ones so far and you can not beat the price ."

Will buy again. * This is an amazing product! Literally matches my skin tone! And it fully covers up! Any of Tartes stuff is amazing! 😘💗✨ * Don't know if it's my skin texture or if it's the foundation, but it cakes up. One of the workers suggested it. * It looked cakey and settled into every pore and line in the most unflattering way possible, even with primer. * I love that Azya helped me try so many shades till we found the right one.. it ids light weight and covers great * I have normal to dry skin and this seemed like it would be very hydrating full coverage…. It's definitely full coverage but looks very cakey on dry skin. The shade range is difficult for neutral, cool tones … couldn't find a good match that brought life to my skin rather than dulled it out * I used tarte for years before I realized it's really not a good foundation for oily skin. I used estee lauder which was great but broke me out and Bobbi Brown which I use now and it makes Tarte foundation look like drug store makeup. It's 100% transferable. Dont accidentally touch your face because the foundation would get on everything. Idk why I believed it was a good foundation but it's really not I'm glad I found better."

Does not clog my pores nor does it affect my existing acne in a negative way. Smooths my skin out and looks natural which I love. Will definitely repurchase and recommend to friends and family especially those who struggle with finding an acne friendly skin tint. * I really wanted to love this skin tint, but it totally broke me out. Apart from that, on the first layer of application it looks god awful on my acne prone skin. A second layer however, looks good. When I wear this skin tint, i always have a problem with having little streak marks on my nose from where i apply blush at the end of my routine. I don't have this problem with  ther foundations. The packaging also makes this product super messy. * There's a reason why everyone hypes this skin tint. It has been the best foundation I've ever bought. Will definitely keep repurchasing this. It covers my hyperpigmentation without that heavy foundation feel and it last so long. I love this product. * If you're looking for light coverage this is for you! I use this as an everyday foundation just to have some color! You are able to build on it. It does have a slight orange hue but with some blush and translucent powder, you're good to go! * I absolutely hate the dropper. The dropper is messy. Won't buy this again or any foundation with a dropper applicator. * This is not a skin tint. I have maturing skin, so I'm trying to step away from full coverage. This is a great step down into light/medium coverage without the shock. Dries down, wears well and it's unscented. If it continues to wear like this, I'll repurchase * I really wanted to try this skin tint but its unusable! Its way to orange the jump from 120-129 is insane! Im far too dark for 120 and im too light for 129! Maybeline, DO BETTER!"

The smell was absolutely terrible, I found the coverage to be uneven, and after an hour or so of wear, I looked in the mirror and it really exaggerated my fine lines and pores. I for sure would not recommend this foundation to anybody over the age of 35. * This is a no for me. It smells terrible and does not work on my skin. Exaggerates dry spots, separates in oily areas, and looks cakey with any amount of product. I've tried applying with fingers, brushes, and sponges. I'm really disappointed I spent so much on it. Drugstore foundations are much better quality than this one! * This is a difficult foundation to work with, the coverage never looks even to me and it's not buildable. up close, I can see it pills on my skin if I pass the sponge over it more than a couple of times. cream products don't layer over it well - it's hard to blend cream blush, bronzer and highlighter on top and it transfers and moves all over the face. It doesn't really set down, even with powder. I have dry skin and never have issues with uneven coverage or getting a foundation to set down, with or without setting powder. I'm just not a fan, I have wet n wild, Catrice, urban decay and Pat McGrath foundations that all perform better across the cost spectrum. * This a wonderful foundation. It gives perfect coverage, making my skin look dewy and fresh.   The best part is that it is a clean product, without the bad stuff.I love this brand. * Not enough coverage for my aging skin! * Unsure. It's not like it's a bad product. I feel it's good quality. I think maybe for a lighter foundation could be a good find. I feel for the price, what my expectations were; not a good buy necessarily. Fell a bit flat for me. I've also only used a couple (2-3) times. Maybe it grows. My skin feels nice.
I don't feel excited afterwords-if that makes sense? Sometimes I put on foundation and I'm like ""OO-Hello there!"" I put this on and feel like…ehh. Best way I can put it. I did have a more positive prospective when adding a glow enhancer. It's ok."

Now I have to find something else… Any recommendations? I love this formula and the results. Previously! * I am in love with this powder!! I am in my 50's and it covers all of my imperfections.

It does transfer less than other foundations I have but it still transfers. * this foundation was the first I had tried that actually matched my skin tone. yes oxidation happens but it was never a problem for me. the bottle actually lasts a long time and i will definitely repurchase one I run out * It literally just turns yellow. I know all foundations oxidize to an extent but this is extreme for the price you're paying. Do yourself a favor and use fenty beauty foundation. * This foundation goes on easy with a damp sponge and a little goes a long way. This makes it well worth the cost. * You have to apply a lot more than I imagined for it to be full coverage but overall it blends well."

I use it every day and it really does last on my skin without looking oily and cakey. The only con for me is that it runs out too fast.
Pro tip: I always set it with the Maybelline Loose Powder and setting spray. * This foundation has stayed during my massive crying breakdown on the way to work this morning. Highly recommend this foundation. * Honestly, about as good as foundation gets, especially under $20.

It feels nice, sets quickly (but slowly enough to blend), and wears mostly matte with a little dewiness. I have acne-prone skin and use a retinoid, so I have been greasy and dry and flaky at the same time! Still, it clings less than most to dry patches, and only requires a light T-zone blot or powder after 3/4 hours. Also, the formula doesn't feel overly dry (and I live in a really dry place), but also sets really well (rain is not a problem).

My only complaint is that I hate how they name the shades. I'm still trading them back in to find my perfect match! Drugstore brands really should go the True Match route and name by undertone and shade... Oh well! I can't speak for the darker shades, but the light shades have decent undertone variety. Olives may struggle.

P.S. Just because foundation has SPF does not mean you shouldn't wear sunscreen under it! It's a stupid marketing gimmick, and the amount you actually apply relative to SPF testing will not protect your skin in any meaningful way."

After that its all splotchy and cakey looking. My makeup looks absolutely terrible after my 8hr work shift. * This new formula is simply awful. It leaves your skin feeling supper heavy. Not to mentioned they got rid of shade #16 sandstone. The compatable new shade is absolutely not the same. I've used this foundation for 6 years & will no longer buy this product. It's sad that this brand faild to see that they had a classic. Bring it back! * This is terrible! Bring back original formula and 11 Natural shade. The color match for the new formula is not even close to the orginal shade. So heavy and cakey!!! * I have used many foundations, it separated on my face and attached to my dry skin. Ive never had a foundation do this before, the pump out of the box was jammed and it didnt blend or have medium coverage which is what I need in a foundation, unfortunately this just wasnt the foundation for me, however if you want something cute with your skin showing through it is nice. * It goes on pretty cakey if you're not careful- just overall too heavy for me. It didn't agree with my skin either and gave me quite a bit of breakouts. * Why on earth would they change the formula. It was amazing before. And now im left trying to find a different brand of foundation. I could have used barepro performance wear for the rest of my life and they changed to this drying heavy cakey horrible solution that is just going to lose them customers. It feels like a waste lf money and now im left looking for a replacement. It didnt even give a hood color match to my natural 11 shade. Now it is more yellow. So disappointing * This new formula is dry and cakey! The old formula was the BEST foundation and ive tried tons of foundations. Please bring the old formula back!!"

Good for sensitive skin too! * Was super excited . Unfortunately for me it was super patchy . I have combo skin * I really like the fountain, enough to keep it as a regular in my routine. However I've noticed that the pump, especially the spring mechanism brakes or fails quickly. Usually I'm halfway through my bottle when the pump fails and then have to remove the top to get anything out of it. 
I would recommend the formula but the dispenser needs work. * The pump didn't work on its own. I had to pull up everytime, this occurred from the beginning.  I'm not sure there is a full ounce in here, as its already gone.  I have kept the bottle upright and its barely coming out but feels empty.    So its either a defective package or not a real ounce. * Foundation is ok, but the pump and the bottle design are awful.  Pump broke after second use. Cap is tricky to take off. So many people reported the same problem with the pump and there's no fix to the problem.  Says a lot about the company and the product itself. * First time trying this on..and wow.. I hope this isn't something that day 3 it starts to break me out because this will be my go to if this stays face friendly, soo fingers crossed. Goes on easy, smooth,  light and feels hydrating.  My skin has been wrecked,  dried with bad acne prob from alot of things but this felt nice on it and has not  clung on to dry patches and covered my acne well..not fully..but good enough for me to be happy with. Add powder and u can't see any acne.So far I think this is so beautiful on my skin and I like how it doesn't feel thick like my Good Apple foundation.  will see if this places well with my skin I hope it does not cause more breakouts bc I would be super sad. * This would get 5 stars if not for the bottle.

Afterwards, If Needed; Use A Buffing Brush. * Sales associate very helpful in finding the product I was looking for * I never leave reviews but this is the worst foundation I HAVE EVER USED.

I did what the ND website said and based my choice on my skin tone in indirect daylight. That shade is significantly paler than my skin in artificial light. 

When I applied the powder, it looked so white on me I felt like I was cosplaying a French aristocrat. I sprayed myself with setting spray and hoped for the best. 10-20 minutes later, the makeup was no longer chalky white. It matched my skin tone perfectly. 

I have oily skin, and this foundation doesn't separate as much as other foundations do after eight hours. It looks like my skin, and it feels like im wearing no makeup at all! It doesnt even feel like I'm wearing makeup when I touch my face! This foundation definitely lives up to its price.

I will say, it definitely seems like it was designed with dry sponges and powder puffs in mind. When I applied it with a powder brush, it was very easy to layer too much on an area with my brushstrokes. I guess I'm used to sheer to medium powders, not medium to heavy. * please make a liquid foundation * Ive bought this multiple time shade range and product is amazing * Ive bought this multiple time shade range and product is amazing * I have olive undertones, but I usually can get away with wearing foundation shades labeled ""neutral"". That was NOT the case, with this. I bought NP13 and then NP14, and they both pulled VERY red, on me. Like, red clay soil, red. I really liked the formula though, so I gave it one last shot and ordered Y13. It is a good match. It is a little yellow on me, but I can get away with it pretty well. This foundation lasts all day without priming or setting. I have combo skin, so this starts off looking matte & poreless; & then looks satiny after my oils start peeking through after a few hours - I love both. I get so many compliments on my skin, when I wear it. Not my makeup, my SKIN. It also didn't flare up my perioral dermatitis, which obviously is a massive plus. IMO, the only thing that would make this foundation better is an improved shade range, & a version with fuller coverage. Other than that, this is a fantastic powder- which is saying something, coming from someone who greatly prefers liquid foundation. * I can tell it was made well and the powder doesnt have a lot of fallout. I wanted to switch from MAC but when I tried it, it set horribly on my skin. Made me look dry and uneven and came off really easily. I am not a professional by any means but my skin is really sensitive so I like higher end products but I couldn't even finish one container before going back to MAC. * First i love all of the color options- im half korean and its hard to match my skin tone. I got  y5-y7 and its a perfect color for me. It goes on so smoothly and you can do a light touch or full coverage and its not drying."

Great colors/color match selection. * I bought this in lightest color very light 0.5-2. Way too dark. Are you kidding? * Most foundations get oily on me by the end of the day and even though I keep testing other ones, I keep going back to this one because it holds up the best after a 12 hour wear and I dont even have to put more powder on throughout the day. * I purchased 4-5 Medium and its a perfect match for Asian skin, 52 yo, with combo (oily in T/zone) I have Laura Mercier and Charlotte Tilbury foundation stick and this Loreal I'm going back to reuse. * This non buildable product was tried out with a brush and sponge application.

Also, i live at a very dry climate and have no issues with patchiness of product. 10/10! * I've spent a lot of money on different foundations over the years and this is by far the best one! I was so excited when Ulta started carrying charlotte tilbury because ife been using this foundation exclusively foe the past 3 years. The product lasts me several months. I apply a layer once in the morning and it lasts all day! * Ive tried so many foundations, but this one takes the cake. The best coverage for the least amount of product, doesnt make my face itch and lasts all day!!
Everyone i recommend this foundation to is hooked!!! 
Not sure why people don't like it but if youre looking for a foundation that will last and get your moneys worth, this js it! * Updating my review! I spoke too soon. This foundation is horrible and is the first makeup that I have ever returned. It transfers so easily, I would find it smeared on my phone. Using without the CT Hollywood filter, the is texture is awful and it only lasts a few hours.  Save your money and go with another foundation. * Really high quality, longwearing foundation.

Has SPF 30. * I needed a replacement for my favorite Les Beiges tinted SPF moisturizer by Chanel, which was discontinued :(. An ULTA assistant pointed me in the direction of Laura Mercier's tinted moisturizer with SPF, which has been great (I'm on my third tube—each has lasted me about 9 months with daily use). I like how this product lightly balances out redness, gives a subtle glow, doesn't bother my skin, and is breathable. * I'm very picky when it comes to base makeup. I have dry/normal skin, a light-medium olive skintone, and I deal with dullness/discoloration. Shade 2N1 is a good shade match for me. I've enjoyed using this with a dense foundation brush. It's easy to sheer out or build up. I would describe it as light/medium coverage. It evens out my skin tone, but doesn't cover blemishes. Its very comfortable on the skin, it feels like a moisturizer, the consistency is thick at first, but it doesn't feel like anything when blended out. I can wear it without powder and it stays on all day for me. Definitely repurchasing. * I've been using this product for years!  I don't like thick heavy coverage so this is very light buildable coverage.  I have pretty good skin, 38 years old, cheeks are pink from dryness with few blemishes and this provides me full coverage.  I do add a thin layer of moisturizer (especially now that I'm older and less oily) and concealer for under my eyes, nose and any glaring blemishes.  It's a very natural finish that does pull warm.  I use 2N1 for my winter everyday color and 2W1 for summer when I'm tanned (it's very yellow/gold). * The Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer goes on nicely,  bur doesnt cover ANY imperfections. Some pilling.  I was hoping to love it, but will be returning it. * This product gives my skin a dry, cakey, look. Its probably the SPF aspect of it."

Some of them are now making me look older and some look good but feel a little sticky and don't last as long as they advertise. This one lasts,doesn't feel sticky, and doesn't make me look old. The BD shade range is a nice subtle olive warm tone. * I love that it's a light weight makeup and very blend able.  Doesn't gather in my dry skin or wrinkles smooths out my face. * I like the product (B40) but half gets wasted bc the packaging is designed poorly.  The top doesnt come off so s we hen pump cant reach the priductvtherecis no way to access it. Very wasteful. * Ever since Mac reformulated their studio fix fluid, I'd been on a deep search for something that even came close. I had tried so many different brands to no avail, and was about at the point of giving up when I decided to give the Chanel Ultra Le Teint a try. Thank GOD I DID! This makeup is absolutely amazing and I like it even better than the old studio fix fluid! It glides on super smooth. Contains ingredients that make my skin moisturized and subtle. It does not oxidize at all and looks even better as the day goes on! The color you see is the color you get. Doesn't separate or get cakey. Doesn't settle into fine lines. Doesn't break me out. Doesn't make me oily and doesn't slide off. I feel absolutely gorgeous in this and my husband just can't take his eyes off of me wearing this. Yay! I'm so happy and I hope Chanel keeps making this one. * I've tried many foundations on the market (ELDW, Dior, Mac, etc) and this one is definitely the best for combo skin! You don't need much, yet it covers fairly well with a damp beauty blender. Feels like you're wearing nothing at all, and looks like skin vs looking like you're wearing a mask. Went for a power walk in 80 degree weather (after using setting powder on top) and there was no sweat or oil that broke through at all! The smell is quite strong but smells like perfume. I have sensitive skin yet my skin did not react to this scented foundation. It is well worth the money!!"

You can control the coverage to be full or even out the skin tone. I apply it with a foundation brush or beauty blender type sponge. Has staying power and never disappoints. * I was recently gifted this foundation. I was not expecting to love it this much. I have been choosing this daily since trying the formula. First, the packaging is well known Lancome esthetic, classic and beautiful.  The formula is creamy but not too slippery and definitely not stiff. blends well with brush for fuller coverage, and sponge to press it in, is my preferred method of application. I loved the color it was a perfect match and I rarely say that. the finish is skinlike with a light to medium coverage, but nearly full IMO, for my personal taste, with just a light powder setting.  I will set with a power foundation for super locked in full coverage. I find it wears all day with a seamless wear that doesn't look cakey and heavy only mature skin. I recently went on vacation and grabbed another because I don't want to run out (and it was  on sale and couldn't pass it up lol 🙂) I can even get away with a light layer with my finer to my under eyes over the Charlotte Tilbury vanish color corrector, for the no makeup look quickie base, mascara, lipoil, maybe blush, and out the door. Chefs kiss*...  and the little brush is actually good in a pinch for concealing undereyes. I already bought a backup and will definately keep in my stock. it  held up in humidity very well on my cruise even through formal dinners, dancing, casino, gameshows, and broadway shows. I am so happy I got this as a gift from a friend or I would likely still be missing out! if you like stick foundation or even if you have had issues with them and are still curious, or, you like lancôme foundationor base products, try it. you just might love it as much I do. * Wanted to love this product, the color match was perfect, texture and overall feel of foundation was great But a week into using I went to open & the whole stick broke off. For the price point not happy. I never extended the stick once to cause this. * I love this product and have used it over the years. Love the formula and glide it has going on. However, it has a very high price  point and doesn't last very long. I have to replace it often and it's too expensive to keep using. Iam looking for a similar product with a lower price point and perhaps more usable product. The is  always leftover product left in the shaft of the barrel which you can dig out and use to help lengthen life of product. * Im 42 and WAS on the hint for a foundation that works for me. Obtried everything every nature beauty influencer suggested. Haus. Armani. IT Cosmetics. Dior. Everything made me look like an oxidized french fry by mid day. Finally, i decided to go against the popular opinon of mature skin shoukd be dewy skin. I needed somethinng new. Ive never tried a stick foundation before and was desperate to find something without skincare ingreidents. I do nt own skincare routine. These skincare ingredients in the foundations only made me greasy, since i was layering it with my own. Anyway, this stick is perfect for me. Not too matte. Easily glides over my skin. Did not pile ny skincare products. Its just perfect. I wish i hadnt wasted so much money on influencer recommendations! I chose shade 320W. * So excited about this product and color! Matches perfectly, however, when I packed for a trip, the stick completely broke into the cap... So sad my $50+ Lancome broke so easily!"

This is a very thick foundation and there is nothing glowy about it. It looks cakey and doesn't illuminate. The smell was weird, too. It is medium to full coverage. I was previously using Estee Lauder's Futurist Hydra Foundation and thought I'd expand my toolkit for something different, and perhaps better. The grass isn't always greener. I am disappointed and will be returning the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care and Glow Foundation. * I tried the foundation cuz I have mature skin. It goes on really nice and the color is well. But within 4 hours it wears off in your face looks like it never had any foundation on it. I even used setting spray. also done at the count as the second ingredient. My skin is sensitive dimethicone, it's also a nasty ingredient. either way this is going back. * First time trying this foundation and super impressed. * Was looking for a change and found this foundation.

Love the dove foot to apply on the face and then use a baity blender to blend in. I use shade F2cool and its a perfect match for my skintone. Previous foundations I've tried have been too drying or cakey for my combination skin but this is perfect and lightly hydrating on the skin for a satin finish. Works perfectly with the Youthforia Pregame primer. I sometimes get kind of sweaty throughtout the day but if i set this with powder it lasts all day! * Ive been an estee lauder doublewear girly for years and years and lately i've been wanting something a little lighter and less dense (and less expensive). Tried this on a whim because of the reviews and i'm thoroughly impressed. I love the coverage, i'd say medium range but definitely buildable, easy to blend, i like the texture. The only singular con is that the doefoot applicator takes a good amount of force to pull out of the bottle so you have to be careful not to get foundation everywhere but i will deal. I'm a convert! * I initially loved this foundation, great shade range and undertones and its a very wearable and natural looking coverage. HOWEVER, i think i found mold and ive only had it for 2.5 months. The sides of the applicator had bluish gray spots. Idk if that's just the color of the bare applicator cuz the sides of the applicator get really scraped by the opening but I dont want to keep using it to later confirm that it is mold * I bought this foundation when it was half off and I will be repurchasing at full price. I recommend it to everyone I know and it's so easy to find your perfect match. Even better than foundations double the price! * I've struggled for over a decade to find the right shade for my south Asian olive tone skin. Every foundation I've tried is either too orange or too pink. Finally, my struggles are over with the shade LMN2 Olive. It is the perfect tone and match. The coverage is great and it lasts all day on my skin. I use a beautyblender to apply 1 pump and top with powder. Any kind of powder works. It looks smooth and radiant. The coverage is medium, but it is totally buildable. It also reacts well with my skin and does not cause any breakouts or skin issues. Thank you for finally creating a foundation that works for my skin! * Lovveee this foundation bad, i just need like a warm-neutral. That'd be perfect!

However, it is patchy when applied! I've tried using sponges, brushes and my fingers but I can't get it to look right. I've played around with my serums, moisturizer, and primer but nothing works as of yet. If I try to blend too much it pills and looks awful. I'm a bit disappointed. I'm not sure I'll be buying this again. * Been using another foundation and I've been feeling like its too light and I look really pale lately. (Im around nc20 but more muted, maybe slightly olive. I usually need a foundation that looks beige without an orange or peach tint to it. I cant do pink undertone at all). 

I was walking past the CT stuff mostly looking at bronzers and eyeshadows, but my eye caught beautiful skin foundation in the shade 5n, and i thought that might work. I swatched it on my hand then on my jawline and it disappeared. I grabbed it off the shelf knowing I could return it if it didnt work, but it's an amazing foundation. It's definitely my favorite at the moment, and maybe HG. 

1. I have sensitive skin. This has no fragrance and i cant feel this on. I actually almost forgot to wash my face last night because i forgot i had makeup on. I usually cannot wait to wash my face at the end of the night. 
2. I have texture issues with large pores, old acne scars, some fine lines ( Im 40). I value blurring more than coverage and this blurs so well! It really lives up to the beautiful skin label because it does that— it gives the effect of just having better skin. Its not a full coverage foundation mask, but more like a blurring veil that evens out my skin. It works well over sunscreen, even mineral which is all i can wear. Ita difficult to find a foundation that plays well with mineral spf without adding unecessary texture. 
3. Holy moly this is actually long lasting. As a caveat i set this with powder, but i have to set all foundations with powder. I have oily skin. This lasts the entire day and i dont look oily at the end of the day. 
4. No shimmer. And its not dewy or matte.  Its a true skin like finish. 
5. Color match is perfect for me. 
6. I like the packaging. A tube with a pump. It travels easy and is easy to apply. Its more sanitary. 

I really hope this doesnt get discontinued or reformulated. I have tried hundreds of foundations and usually I hate them. I read this was reformulated once already, I've only tried this current version, but it's perfection! * Im so picky about foundation. This is absolutly beautiful and looks like skin. Can't feel it sitting on the skin and the finish is like nothing I've ever used. Covers and looks so pretty. I can't say enough good about it. Its worth every penny. Buy it! You won't be disappointed * I got tbis with a gift card I was given, and upon trying it for 3 days in a row, I really like it! It's a thin formula but it has good coverage, and looks super natural. It's radiant but not shiny, and after a full day outside in warmer wather, and also light rain, it still looked pretty good late into the evening! * I've spent my entire life trying a million different foundations. Trying to find something that truly matched and didn't look like I was ""wearing foundation."" This is it for me. I have dry and red skin and this perfectly covers all my imperfections in one application. It gives a dewy finish while looking soo natural. This may seem silly, but I can actually say this foundation has given me confidence in my life. I'm on my 3rd bottle. It is expensive but I'm so glad I decided to try it. * Looks great upon first application but is not for longest. Gets clustered and feels sticky/tacky to the skin. It may work for some, but for my combination skin it was a hard no. I wanted to love it so bad, but just couldn't ! * I got this because of all the hype and wow I am so dissapointed! I prepped my skin and used different primers and everytime this product sticks to every dry patch or highlights pores and its got a sticky cake like consistency. I cannot believe how awful it is. I get better coverage and finish from drug store brands. This is not worth it and I wont be buying it again or any of the others"

As an oily skin girly, i love the matte finish. Will definitely buy again and again. * My skin tends to be sensituve, and I used this foundation thinking this product and the ingredients were the best because it's ""Dior"". After using it for a few days (before realizing it was the problem), my face brone out in hives and cystic acne that unlike anything I have ever experienced. It was so bad, I didn't leave my house for a week! Now I am left with scars on my face that could take years to recover from. I dont know if it's the ethylhexyl salicylate, alcohol, or mystery frangance in this ish, but I wouldn't wish what happened to me on my worst enemy. Dont touch this stuff with a 10 ft pole!!!

I'm trying not to hold it against ""Dior"" or Ulta, but the fact that they're even letting this stuff stay on the market baffles me. Dont use this. * If you have tried the YSL matte foundation and you're looking for a less expensive version this is it! It smells amazing, has the SPF and stays on matte. I live in AZ where if is hot and this does not feel heavy or cakey. * I decided to try this foundation after seeing reviews on YouTube. But it does not live up to the reviews. It is not transfer proof, and it rubs off so easily. If you touch your face, it's smearing. I may have to go back to bare minerals. * The foundation itself is great. It goes on smooth and it last long it is not greasy or oily. The pump keeps clogging, every few days when I dispense it shoots out at angles, it gets on my clothes, and I have to change last minute. It gets on the wall… its very frustrating. It is good make up, but if I am spending this much money, the packaging should be good too. * This foundation seriously changed the game for me. I have a hormonal IUD and have been on meds to correct the skin issues it has given me, and this has done wonders for controlling oil!

I thought maybe I received a bad/old bottle, so I got out the other one I had but alas, the same thing happened. I'm not sure what was changed but I hope they change it back soon!!! In the meantime, off to try to find something new. * I've used Fresh Alabaster color for 20 years. My new bottle of Alabaster is so orange! Why change things! Oh, so someone can keep their job.  I'm going to have to find a different foundation for my pale skin. Product and time waster for me as the consumer. * Never used a product that resulted in such an overall transformation! Skin looks amazing! * Did not stay on, made me look oily, & look so orange ): * Super bummed about the update of this product's formula. This used to be my go-to foundation. Not anymore. It does not glide on easily anymore - you definitely need an oil-based primer if you use this. * This foundation makes me feel like I'm wearing nothing, but provides good coverage for my acne & scars.

I have nice skin to begin with a little dry but that's it this take my skin to another level. I purchased 2 more just in case something happens to it. * I really wanted to like this product. I have oily/combo skin and realized every time I wore this foundation-primer or not-it would oxidize in more oily areas of my skin and make me break out badly. Coverage is okay besides those issues, but not worth it!! * Looks great at first, but after an hour it looks patchy and like its just sitting on top of the skin. Maybe its just my skin (combo) but i wouldnt purchase again. * super light and creamy so soft and works great, I have bad black circles and carry this in my purse bag * I have been looking for an in between of a foundation and a skin tint and this fits the bill! It is so easy to use and control where you place it and add more in some spots you need it compared to a liquid. It doesnt settle into fine lines and im also excites that its not a liquid because I travel alot so added benefit! * I have combo/mostly oily skin and don't finding something light for everyday has been a struggle. Skin tints usually make my skin too shiny and just using powder doesn't always give me the coverage I want. This is the perfect medium- i blend some of this then blot some powder over and it looks amazing! Blends well but also seemed to seperate slightly when i added more, will try with primer next time"

It's light and buildable, which is great for achieving a natural look. I don't quite like how it sets in my creases, so it's not something I would reach for for a look I'd be wearing for a long time. The packaging, however, is very luxurious - glass bottle with a nice pump. * The Fenty Beauty Soft'Lit Naturally Luminous Longwear Foundation Shade 420 is an amazing bronzer for me myself but would be a good foundation for a darker person. Honestly the product itself is really dry and I've never gotten it to blend out very well across my face. It doesn't really have a scent and the packaging was pretty like the whole bottle is really pretty, but it didn't work that well for me. * I have never used this foundation before but have been using the primer for a while now. I got a perfect color much! I wore it in Hawaii and it stayed on perfect and didn't melt in all of the humidity and the heat. * I am a makeup lover. I especially love testing new foundations. I would say I have a large collection of foundation. I purchased this foundation when it was released. I have already bought my winter shade. I have dry, mature skin. I am 40 years old. I do not like glowy, luminous foundations for two reasons, they never last on me and I don't want to look shiny. I get compliments every single time I wear this foundation. It is hydrating and just makes my skin look healthy, not shiny. This foundation also lasts a very long time. I apply my make up on early in the mornings and take it off late that night. I do not do touch ups and this foundation looks great at night taking it off. It is literally perfect!! * I DO NOT RECOMMEND. This product is so cake like on skin. It is so pigmented that you won't be able to blend it out one time I had to start my whole make up over because it would've blended you also can't use it with a brush or get streaky. * I love fenty beauty make up , good coverage and the scent is not strong like others brands .

I'm a huge fan of Hourglass and wanted something for those days when i dont feel like going full coverage. I spread this with my hands rather than foundation brush (although i do blend a little using a brush after applying). Its very light but definite coverage. 

It feels very lightweight, which i like. I have been using this as a full foundation just like i would use my normal foundation (setting powder + setting spray). I feel that my face looks more natural than when i wear full foundation. 

But it's just so tiny and expensive that i just dont know if ill repurchase. * I'll admit up front that I'm a product junkie. Skincare is super important to me and I believe that also involves having the best makeup that compliments your features, not hides them. I am in my early 40's and I've probably tried most foundations, sparing no cost to have that flawless ""I woke up this way"" skin. I began to move away from medium to full coverage foundation recently and tried Mac moisturizing tint coverage (dewy) and I loved it. The con- too dewy for me. I have oily skin and I was tired of always blotting my T-zone. I decided to give Hourglass Tint a try based on the positive reviews. Within the first week I was getting compliments on my skin daily. People didn't believe me at first that I wasn't wearing foundation, just tint. No more overly oily T-zone either.  I work in healthcare, so I'm in a lot of people's faces often. I even had someone hand me their phone to search the exact product I used. This tint will be my main go-to from now on. * Felt great on all day but caused acne breakout. Ran the ingredients through an app that identifies what may cause breakouts and it flagged the shea butter in hourglass veil hydrating tint. This would be great for someonewho doesn't breakout * Covers nicely and easy to blend * Stila recently discontinued their illuminating veil at first I was  frustrated but my match in hour glass is so much better than Stila. I love the coverage and feel of this product. * Stays a bit dewy and is sheer coverage . Not enough for me . I returned it . * The color match is fantastic and has a nice coverage but feels like it sits on the skin. It feels like I can just wipe it all off with one swipe. I am oily so maybe its just not for that type of skin? My pores also look huge. I keep using it hoping I will like it, but will probably be returning soon."

I wear it to my 9 to 5 and then I keep it on when I go to the gym after work. I sweat a lot in on my face and this foundation has stayed on through all of that.

Since this product contains silicones, I used my silicone based sunscreen. The pairing resulted in an uneven distribution of pigment when you looked closely but wasnt very noticable far away. The foundation was very comfortable and wore well throughout the day. Using a mineral based sunscreen underneath gave a much better appearance. Just be careful about what is layered underneath. * Full coverage * Horrible! This foundation feels like sand paper and cakes right away. It is not possible to blend this and the coverage is very minimal. If you have any imperfection or texture on your face DO NOT USE!  
I wanted to love this product because I love the brand and it was actually a production I could use (due to allergies), buy sadly it went  right in the garbage. * I've repurchased this foundation twice. It is long wearing, and can easily be touched up with just your finger tips, no additional product. I had a long workday schedule this summer both indoor and outdoor. This foundation gave me coverage throughout the day. I touched up with my finger and a little pressed powder, good to go. I also spent one day getting wet and I still had the coverage there without cakiness. The trick is not to use too much product, I apply it using a beauty sponge. I just wish it came in more shades, the lighter shades give me a yellowish complexion. * I have oily skin and have had a hard time finding a foundation that doesn't slide down my face by lunch time. With proper skin prep and moisturization, this foundation works like a dream without the use of a primer or setting spray. During the summer set the eye brow area with translucent powder. My powder products also stick and blend with this foundation very well. * I went to about 30 concerts this spring and summer and this foundation lasted through every show! I'm naturally a sweaty girl and was concerned about finding a foundation that would last as I danced and sang my nights away and this foundation was it! Most days I would put it on the mornings before work and I never once had to touch it up or worry about it looking anything less than perfect by the end up the fun filled night. There were some days that I was so exhausted I'd just come home and fall asleep and when I woke up in the morning my face would look like I had just done my makeup. This is now and will always be my go to choice. * I have oily skin and thought it would fit me but it is so hard to blend it sets as soon as it touches your face will leave you patchy , I wear a face mask for work so I thought I'd try something new 0/10 this is the worst foundation I've ever used !"

Name a skin type…i have it. Lol. But serously this beautiful powder is by far the best powder foundation i have ever tried and i have tried nearly all of them. You can sheer it out for a set or finish or pack it on for a full coverage moment. All wirhout looking dry or cakey. It is the first powder i don't immediately reach for a setting spray to ""melt"" it. You can. But you dont have to. This conpany is also on my good list for being loudly and proudly prochoice. Love it. * I'm a powder foundation junky. I hate liquid foundation so much. So I always use powder foundation. The reason I LOVE this foundations are 1) long lasting wear 2) doesn't look cakey at all 3) but still has great coverage without looking heavy 4) color matches my skin tone very well. I have tried from cheap to high end ones and I say this is one of the best. I have one more favorite but I'm keeping it as my beauty secret! * I'm in my late 30s and was looking for a powder that wouldn't sink into my fine lines, and lasted. This was not it. The coverage is too transparent, so you have to use a lot of get better coverage, and then it doesn't have any staying power. Maybe it's my skin or my primer that doesn't work well with it, but for the price I wasn't impressed. * I have used PUR Cosmetics pressed powder foundation for 5+ years, but it has retinol in it and I'm pregnant. I tried several other brands of powder foundations (Bare Minerals, Lancome, Maybelline) and they all looked so patchy, cakey, and horrible. I tried this as a last-ditch effort, and I'm so glad I did! This is a fantastic pressed powder foundation. It applies easily, doesn't look patchy, doesn't look cakey, doesn't settle into my fine lines, and provides decent light/medium coverage. This has a very nice semi-matte finish, and looks very natural on the skin with a feather-light texture. I will say PUR's product offers a little more coverage in my opinion, but this product is still amazing. I love the ingredients, and I love the refillable compact concept. I highly recommend this! I have combination, acne prone skin and this did not cause breakouts for me. * I originally purchased the kit on the JE website, then came back to Ulta.com to get my refill. This is the only foundation I've ever actually used up!!! I have rosacea and wear glasses, so my tzone does get shiny and requires a small touchup at midday. Some tips:
-use a primer of some kind, either Jane's or another that you like.
-get a retractable travel brush (I use the one from Eco Tools) this is great for touchups and when I need more coverage, I twist the brush only halfway (making it denser) which gives more coverage for my cheeks because I have rosacea. If you need heavy coverage, you are going to want a dense brush to sort of pack it on in downward patting strokes. 
DO NOT swirl/buff...this is not the other mineral powder. different formulas work differently. 
  * This perfectly matches my skin tone. It's very difficult to see when I swab it on my face to see the color.  Nothing  else has ever matched like this. I have been using it for about 8 years. I have normal to dry skin and this gives a natural look. * Initially I didn't like this powder. Was accustomed to fuller coverage powder foundations and i think the shade i chose was a bit light. Decided to use it as a setting powder over a tinted moisturizer because i had a sample of a good tinted moisturizer i wanted to try. I really only wanted to use it up so my money wasn't wasted. This is where i fell in love. It's very good at blurring and I found that it was better than the 100 different setting powders I'd used. I'm a little surprised about the reviews that mentioned cracking because this is the ONLY powder I've ever had in 35 years (in my 50s) that i used completely. Even the little edges stayed in place until they were completely gone. Weird. I can only guess it's because i never bought the hard case to put it in because I initially didn't love it. It stayed in the plastic refill case until ENTIRELY gone."

It's medium coverage and not buildable, so for the little spots that I need a bit more, I dab on the Dior foundation stick. Such a natural look. Foundation is the only Dior product I own, but I recommend trying it. I can use much less product than other brands, imo it's the same price at the end and looks better. As mom said, you get what you pay for. * Got the shade 00n and it matches perfectly. Its a actual super pale foundation without looking like face paint! * First off I love this because of the shade match... I am a light medium olive, which is hard to find. This also gives a beautiful glow, I have dry skin .so I like it,  it doesn't settle into fine lines ... only problem is the transfer... it's awful if you have babies or toddlers.. of if your partner loves to cuddle.. it will transfer * The lady who was helping me was dead on. I had been previously sold a concealer/Foundation, which made me look orange, Monique picked the Perfect color For me,  I could not be happier! The Ulta I went to is located in the promenade Plaza located in Edgewater, New Jersey * This foundation is light, covers my flaws, and lasts 24 hrs. It does smudge off or get cakey. Dior products are the best@ * I don't understand what justifies the high price of this foundation. The color match was beautiful, but the TRANSFER! I have tried every primer, powder  and setting spray but this transfers on everything. And the smell is odd. * I wanted to love this foundation because I heard so many great things about it but I had to wash it off after 10 minutes because I had an allergic reaction to the fragrance in it."

It's light and stays on. * I am very confused by the positive reviews for this, especially the ones by ladies with mature skin. This foundation is pretty bad. like another reviewer, I have tried using this in every way I can think of. With different primers, setting sprays, etc. It has so many issues. Makes my pores look huge even with blurring primers, settles into my smile and one forehead line so bad. It's super cakey and slides off the face. Like I was in shock the first time I wore it, it looked ok in my beauty room but once I stepped in the light, I looked insane. I will try it. Couple of more times but I'll have to give up after that. * I really enjoyed using this foundation. I found the coverage to be very buildable so I could get a full if I wanted to!

It stays all day I can wear moisturizer underneath it without it peeling iff ir running off. Its amazing. The coverage is so good. It looks so good. I'm telling you you gotta try it. Please don't ever stop making this. * I bought this my first time when it was on sake and always to back to it. I love the dewey finish and it gives a nice medium civerage without caking.

Associate was knowledgeable and helpful. * I have been using this for years and it's the best foundation I've ever used! Great coverage, never looks cakey, and always get compliments on my skin.

I live in a dry state and have struggled with my skin drying out - the hydrating properties leave my skin glowing! I'm also at a higher elevation and credit the sun protection properties with protecting my skin in a way that it has slowed wrinkles, fine lines, and sun damage!

I've also suffered from comedonal acne in the past but this has never caused a reaction.

I will be absolutely devastated if this is ever discontinued. It is my favorite and I can't even fathom using anything else. * At first, I was happy to have found a foundation in a light enough tone, and was impressed by how well it matched and covered up my bit of acne. However, as I wore it, I noticed my acne getting worse day by day. It was doing a great job coverage-wise, but I kept breaking out more and more until I stopped using it. After I stopped, my acne calmed down, leaving me with the same issue as before.."

Im a south florida girlie so sometimes I want just slight coverage with my spf and to look like a glowy, beachy queen but this product is terrible. I have pretty balanced skin, no acne, occasionally some slight dryness in the T-zone but this product (regardless of the amount used) made me look dry and greasy at the same time and was so patchy. It doesnt feel like it blends in to an even layer with hands, brush or blender. If you get somewhere ""even"" it just looks like you have nothing but oil on. Just sits on the skin, very heavy. If you try to set it, it gets worse. * This skin tint is my all time favorite! * This tinted moisturizer feels heavier than my Estee Lauder Double Wear. The coverage is good but shade 2 pulls way orange and dark. Overall, just not that impressed for the price. I'd go back to L'Oreal's Tinted Serum if it was light enough for my pale winter self. * I don't wear much by way of foundations as they often just sit on my skin, don't blend in, and look patchy. Also, I don't need much coverage; I just need to even out my skin tone. The only products that have worked gor me in the past is Glossier's balm concealer and skin tint. 

This product fits my needs. It blends in well, it light coverage, doesn't sit heavy, or detract from from my natural skin. It has excellent shade ranges (at least at the light end of the spectrum), making it easy to find a more neutral tone. It doesn't also sit in the small wrinkles under my eyes, calling attention to them. 

A little bit does go a long way. I use about a pea sized amount to cover my whole face. This renders the sunscreen aspect useless, but as I alway apply sunscreen as a separate part of my skincare routine, its a non-issue for me. * Not oily or shiny looking * I love tinted SPFs and BB creams with SPF. They are my bread and butter. I've used many of them over the years, and this one has been one of my least favorites. I have near perfect skin, barely any texture at all and not much to cover, mainly just to even things out and brighten the face. That's why I use a tinted SPF over foundation, however, this product clings and highlights things that were invisible before, like dry patches and texture. It looks beautiful in the mirror, but taking a closer look is a horror show. Crusty, patchy, weird granules that weren't previously there. I tried to use it again because my skin looked and felt really good today, and it still made my skin look bad! I think I will just toss it rather than trying to finish the tube....

Pros: Great shade selection, lightweight, a little goes a long way. 
Cons: Gritty in texture, leaves a feeling of debris on the face, burns eyes, clings to dryness. * I got color matched in the store after an Ulta associate told me this was a good option for light coverage. I tried it at home and found it to be so incredibly thick and pastey. The tube says it's ""breathable"" on your skin and it felt anything but that! I hated the way it looked on my skin and had to wash it off immediately. I'll be returning this one."

It flakes off immediately after applying. Applies patchy and uneven. Looks chalky. Terrible. Would not recommend * Bought this a while back before the formula change and i remember it being decent. Now it can get a little cakey if youre not careful, but it still gives the coverage I remember. If you have dry skin this foundation might be a little too dry for u. With my combo skin I have learned to prep my skin a certain way to get the results I want. * The matte formula is just not as good as the previous fluid fix. It accentuates any dry patches on the skin and gets cakey by end of the day. it just leaves you looking dry. I loved the previous formula that left a silky finish. now I have to find another foundation, bummer! * I used the naked skin foundation FOREVER UD discontinued it, just like all the other great products they had. It appears MAC is now doing the same. I stopped buying their other products since the change was noticeable in the now poor quality of their cult classic lipsticks and patchy shadows. Now they've changed the foundation too. I have combo, textured skin with acne and in my 30s.  This used to look flawless and match my skin almost perfectly. In the new formula it's 2 shades lighter than before. Only plus to this I can find is the built in pump now. Disappointed and bummed. on the hunt again * One of the sad people who religiously wore studio fix and had to purchase this new formula. It's better than I expected after reading recent reviews…but it is not the original formula obviously. I do not like change and hardly change items in my makeup routine so this was upsetting. I did have to go in store to find my new shade. NC20 is NOT the same as the new NC20. It's bright orange. I am now NC18. Not 100% happy with it. It does not match exactly as the old formula. I wear setting spray and loose mineral powder over my liquid foundation but I still felt oily after a few hours. More so than with the previous formula."

I have 4 different shades and not one works 330 is a tad too dark, but 300 is too light. 260 and 250 are currently too light, but are for when im not swimming * This is definitely one of the better pressed powder foundations out there.  It applies smoothly and looks natural, and shockingly i found a great color match (golden sun, im normally mac nc42-45 depending on the season).  Tips for application: start with properly moisturized skin.  I found using the included puff (or similar) AND using gentle pressure (dont drag it) to swipe and pat product in the skin provides best coverage.  Then use a brush if necessary to even it out.  Apply other powder product over it, and use a setting spray to finish and it should not look powdery/dry.  My only issue is staying power, but that is a problem i have with face products across the board (i tend to touch my face, blow my nose a lot throughout the day) * I started buying this since the other brand I was using has raised their prices so much. I don't plan on going back! The reason for 4 stars is it runs out fast. * I have combination skin and larger pores. This powder over my moisturizer looks at the first sight super good but when you go into the sunlight and have better light it looks awful. It gives a very unnatural look and makes your pores look bigger. * This powder emphasized my texture and looked cake. * This gives great coverage and doesnt look cakey. I use this as a finishing powder and it gives longevity to my makeup. I also used it for touch ups for a wedding day (12 hour wear!) * My mom went to the ER 3 days ago and this make up is still on her face! I hate to wash her face because she still looks great.
Im getting this for myself."

Blends beautifully, looks pretty natural and DOES NOT show my small lines and deep wrinkles any worse.  Because it's super moisturizing some of my lines actually look better. The longer the day does, the better it sets. Love this product. * Like the name says, this is just a tint. Its not buildable. Perfect for my no makeup days. Leaves a very pretty glow. No spf so it feels very lightweight. I'm on my second one. I wear the shade medium, in other chanel foundations I wear bd31. * I wouldnt call this foundation exactly , but with proper skin care this is it. I exfoliate daily, moisturize after serum and use this as my foundation. It completely evens out my skin tone and adds a subtle glow. I use medium. Its slighty warmer than my natural tone and perfectly watms up my skin. Doesnt crack or cake into pores and with a nice setting powder over top , my skin looks great. I tried to go back to a heavier foundation on a night i wqs going out and regretted the entire night. Especially after a few hours. I wont be without this new brilliant product from chanel. * I wore this on my wedding day instead of my foundation (a last minute decision, lol) and it was just a dream. It has this magical way of spreading pigment without sinking into texture or lines, and it gives a beautiful glow. I will buy this forever! * I had high hopes for this one but was left a bit disappointed.  Very very lightweight with barely any coverage. A slight hint of tint, not sticky.  It did feel nice on the skin. I use it as a base to start, which I never do.  Other less expensive lumi products, that can be worn alone are better for me. * A tinted water gel that can give you a glass skin look (at least it did for me). For it to work for you, you need to have good skin. In French culture (since this is Chanel), skin care comes first and makeup enhance the beauty. This is exactly what this product is about. If you are looking for coverage, then this is not the product for you. But if you are looking for no-makeup-makeup, then this is it. * This stuff is magic. It's super low coverage and leightweight, yet somehow makes a huge impact on the look and feel of my skin. I have late 30's normal-to-dehydrated fair skin with plenty of freckles and hyperpigmentation. This plumps my skin like crazy, the tiny tint is somehow enough to tone down redness and the finish is flawless, like a filter without looking makeup-y. It's totally undetectable and just looks like you're having a great skin day. Seriously magic and I'm pumped that Ulta now carries it, because it's not cheap and Ulta's rewards are SO much better than any other retailer. I have only two criticisms of this product: it is fragranced with the classic Chanel scent, and the packaging is massive for the volume of product you get. Not at all travel friendly. So when I travel, I bring the complexion touch product, which is very similar but slightly more pigmented. Comes in much more reasonable packaging and is unscented. I do like this product better than the complexion touch, however. Something about it just looks more magical on my skin. It has become my all-time favorite holy grail base product."

This makes my skin look so good and fresh! * Love my Clinique foundation. Also love the packaging! At first I thought it was so different from my past foundation packaging, but absolutely love the convenience and ease of using the tube that just fits in your hand! * I must admit that I didn't expect to like this foundation, but I did purchase it because I don't know how to say no thank you.  When I got home my husband complimented me.  He thought I looked so rested and refreshed!  What ???  I've been wearing this foundation for two weeks now and have gotten compliments on my complexion from total strangers!  Why not give it a try. * Goes on easily, blends perfectly. Slightly lighter than my normal color so I mix them. * It took me years to find a good color match foundation that also plays well with my mostly dry but still combo skin. I LOVE this foundation! I do have to make sure I use a moisturizer, primer, and setting spray, but when i do, it goes on amazing and looks and feelz natural all day long. The perfect mid coverage for dry skin. Don't know what some of these reviews are saying…it does not oxidize (you just have the wrong shade) and it's definitely not chalky. * I like using this foundation.  Great coverage , yet feels light on my skin.  I have been using it for a few years. * I really dont like the look or feel of full coverage foundation so this is perfect for me. It looks like my skin but better, very hydrating and the coverage is buildable . Ive been using this for years haven't found anything else like it."

I am a makeup junkie who likes to try different foundations. I also do some part time ""acting""-commercials,print jobs, film extra. Several times a makeup artist has complimented me on makeup application-no touch up needed with foundation for a job. I really like the smooth, silky feel of this on my skin. It provides decent coverage. I use a sponge to apply. Not cakey. The only issues are color matching & no SPF. The closest shade for my skin tone was a tad too light & the next shade was a tad too dark. I use this for daily wear but do have another brand that I reserve for when I spend time to put on  a ""full face""- going out, special  occasions, travel, etc. * I love this stuff. Coverage is good- and the texture is really nice! * Ulta employee recommended this for my oily skin thinking if you use a hydrating formula your skin wont make extra oil, this was so wrong for my skin. This gave me giant deep zits and i was still oily soon after applying even with primers. I tried silicone and water/dimethicone based primers bc I really want this to work as the shade 015 was a perfect match for my fair neutral/slightly cool tone. I've never had a more perfect color match than this apple balm foundation but the acne was shocking. I even took a break to clear up my skin and the next time i tried i broke out the next morning. Clinique skin care does this to me too and i may be sensitive to silicone but not sure what the problem is. Benefit silicone primer doesn't bother me fwiw * I took a break from using this foundation to try out different formulas (serum, liquid) and keep coming back to it as my perfect choice. lightweight, even application that can easily be buffed in with a fluffy brush. most products applied on top of the foundation blend perfectly instead of pulling up the foundation under and it doesn't rub off under my mask! 
I use powder to prime and spray to set * This product is amazing for people with dry skin or for very fair and light people. always looks airbrushed and easy to apply/blend.

however
-it is expensive
-only sells in red or yellow undertone which means u NEED to buy two and mix 

so even though this is literally the best foundation its cery expensive and the shade range is annoying

now in terms of transfer, if u have a good setting powder and a good fixing spray i dint see why this would happen vut i also dont gave oily skin so maybe thats the big determining factor * Love this makeup and all producthe maker. maker."

So that's a statement! It's that good! It's pricey, yes but I always find myself reaching for it over my other many foundations because it always makes my dry mature skin look good. And isn't that why we wear foundation? It's a natural finish with a slight glow and a subtle blurring effect. Not overly dewy or greasy at all. I think any skin type could wear this but it does contain fragrance if that's a deal breaker. Chanel doesn't always have the best shade range but I was able to find a good shade match in this formula. I consider this a light but buildable coverage. Try it. It's worth the price. * I have kept this in my foundation rotation for a few years now. It's one of my daily go to's. I use bd31, great match for my light medium skin tone. Medium coverage, buildable. I have normal/dry skin and this sets really nicely and gives a good radiance. I get 8-10 hours of wear, do use the les beiges powder with it as well. Dry skin ladies, give it a try!! * For the price, I feel like it should be wooooww but honestly it's okay. It does it job. Not for acne girlies as in won't cover dark spots or acne so you have to color correct first. But won't break you out. This is light coverage, skin like. There are many other foundations like this and for cheaper. * I love Chanel foundation! It is the best! I have tried others and I always go back to Chanel! It is full coverage light meaning it doesn't feel heavy on your face and smooth.  I have bought it for years and only changed to try something new that has come out. I always go back to Chanel! * I agree with the other review that said that it doesn't stay. I only had it on for like 2 hours but it faded on my face. It's Autumn, so I'm not even that oily and the temps aren't hot. Also any time I accidentally touched my face, it got all over my fingers and erased the foundation. I get that light foundations usually don't have the chemicals that make matte foundations more transfer-resistant, but I shouldn't have to make sure nothing touches my face even the slightest bit all day, not if you claim to be long-wearing.

It also just didn't look nice enough regardless of its flaws to be worth the price. I didn't expect my skin to look like it was filtered, but it certainly didn't look nearly as nice as other reviewers said.

I got the lightest shade BD00 and it was too yellow. I have neutral skin and 1 layer is flexible enough to pull off, but more than that it was really yellow.

I really wanted to love it as a skincare foundation but not for a performance this poor. * I wanted something light, build able, moisturizing and that would smooth out my pores & wrinkles. It's my go to! Age 45! * If you have dry skin and wants to try different look, then you will find it in Chanel Healthy Glow. Use a sponge/beauty blender to use it as a tinted moisturizer; use a brush for heavier coverage; if you want an airbrush look, add powder. This is perfect for all year long. My holy grail!"

The coverage is beautiful and lightweight. I do not need to add any other product to my face other concealer. This is flawless. I also purchased the illuminating setting spray and that gave me the perfect. Dewy finish * It was very thick and cake like. Wasn't smooth. Also it was the wrong shade, too yellowy. * After Reading the comments i just wanna say i love  this foundation. However if u are not prepping your skin with a proper skincare regimen and a primer you will not get the application you desire. Thats with any foundation! Also if u have texture , acne or wrinkles be mindful no foundation is magic. Skincare is key for a decent look. Make up is not magic it doesn't make your flaws magically disappear. * I use this foundation all over and it has excellent coverage! I can even add a little more in spots that need it and they just disappear! My only complaint is for them to change the bottle. I am almost out of product, but i can tell there is soooo much more leftover on the sides of the bottle. The problem is that it's impossible to scrape it due to the doe foot applicator fitting through such a narrow hole."

Highly recommend for natural everyday makeup use. * I honestly wanted to love this fondation because it blends nice and feels like nothing on my skin and when taking it off it really does feel like it improved my skin but it is NOT for oliy skin when first applied it looks heavenly but after an hour or two i look like the peanutbutter baby and it turns blotchy and pacthy for a bit i thought it was my other products but when i switched my foundation i didnt have that problem but i would still recommend this for my dry skin girlies because its skincare benefit is amazing * my skin looked flawless. Love it! Cant wait to try the concealer next * This is my new favorite foundation. I held out on buying NARS for a while mostly because of cost. But this product looks like SKIN and stays on all day * As someone with pale & dry skin, I often cannot find my perfect match. When I do find my perfect match, the foundation is usually very heavy and dries out my skin. Nars Light Reflecting Foundation FINALLY changed that for me - it covered all my redness and even my eyebags, but it still looked like my SKIN, and it felt like my skin as well. Only note is that you'll need three pumps for a light-medium coverage look, so don't purchase if you're in the market for a full beat.

I have acne scars very large pores deep smile lines that collect the makeup.... And I'm 53. All the nightmares!!!!  This foundation!!!  I mean common!!!  It covered everything!  It blurred the pores on my nose, which nothing ever has, it didn't settle it those deep lines, even the ones in the corner of my mouth!!!  I looked Dewey all day!  I felt like I was wearing nothing. It wasn't even the right shade cause they were out but I just used a bit of bronzer and omg perfection!!  I will never ever use anything else. Yes it's a bit fragrant but that disappears in a few hours no big deal. * It is light with good coverage...looks very natural! * I would like to give 3.5 stars if i could but it isnt an option and i think it deserves more than 3… BUT its nothing spectacular by any means - the CC cream was phenomenal and wheb they discontinued it I was hoping for soemthing that  that lit my skin like that did … this doesnt.

However I've noticed that the pump, especially the spring mechanism brakes or fails quickly. Usually I'm halfway through my bottle when the pump fails and then have to remove the top to get anything out of it. 
I would recommend the formula but the dispenser needs work. * The pump didn't work on its own. I had to pull up everytime, this occurred from the beginning.  I'm not sure there is a full ounce in here, as its already gone.  I have kept the bottle upright and its barely coming out but feels empty.    So its either a defective package or not a real ounce. * Foundation is ok, but the pump and the bottle design are awful.  Pump broke after second use. Cap is tricky to take off. So many people reported the same problem with the pump and there's no fix to the problem.  Says a lot about the company and the product itself. * First time trying this on..and wow..

I am mid-40s with ""good"" skin that is on the drier side due to autoimmune disease. I have plenty of fine lines, hereditary dark circles, and a skin tone that is difficult to match. This foundation checks all my boxes: light-medium coverage, serum texture, not drying, and on top of that, I dont even need to use undereye concealer with this. It works best for me to just use the foundation. It's amazing. I dont know what else to say about it except that now Morphe will probably discontinue it since it's my holy grail. As far as the tough color match, I have a very cool undertone but not extremely fair skin (more of a medium). Everything always looks yellow on me. This has a great match. It also does a gold job of covering rosacea. I don't have to set it with powder if I don't want to. 

Other foundations I've used and liked, to a lesser degree: 
Ilia Skin Tint (needs way more setting than this does) 
Clinique Even Better Makeup 
Dr. Jart BB cream
Missha BB cream * The foundation is pretty good, full coverage and lasted without getting cakey. But when it arrived in the mail it was like the lid was loose and it was leaking. I tightened it and cleaned it before putting it in my makeup bag. It still leaks around the sides and gets all over my other make up in my bag! Not sure if mine was just defective or if anyone else is having this problem * Absolutely love it!  Just what I was looking for...Perfect coverage. * This is such an underated foundation. I have combination dry skin. I do not use cream blush or bronzer. Im a powder type of girl so I always set with powder then hydrating setting spray for the dew look without being grease if that makes sense. This foundation doesnt need a primer, it looks better without . Last all day and it is smooth . One of my favorite ones so far and you can not beat the price ."

It makes my skin look like skin, just perfected!! It does not look like I have makeup on! It evens out my skintone and adds the perfect amount of coverage for every day, especially during hot summer days. I bought this because I was on the hunt for something that would be lighter and not melt off my face in a gross cakey way in the heat, and this is it!! I wish I tried it sooner!! * As a very oily girl, i hate to say but i am disappointed. The doible wear is great for oily skin but i needed something light coverage and matte at the same time. I needed something to wear to work everyday. Unfortunately, my oily skin pertruded after a two hours snd i had to pat down my skin. So i recommend if you have you combo skin but for oily skin not necessarily. * I'm on the fence. Love the finish very natural. Doesn't settle in lines and wrinkles. Very runny and thin seems to take a lot of product to produce a full face coverage.  My 70yo skin on nose is breaking out a bit and this is only new product I am using so I'm just not sure  will keep trying * I really enjoy using this foundation. It is so lightweight, a perfect color match, and wears nicely throughout the day. It doesnt get overly oily/shiny in my T-zone where I experience that the most. Minimal setting into my fine lines and wrinkles - even less when I prep with a primer. 

I highly recommend! * I have dry skin and the regular estee lauder foundation wasnt for me. However, this one worked well. It's lightweight and still covers the small red and dark spots but I would not recommend it to someone looking for a full coverage. * For reference, I have fair warm toned, moderately oily skin. I usually wear 1.05 in Smashbox Studio Skin, and NC15 in MAC Waterweight. I wear 1n2 Ecru in this foundation. I love love this foundation. It is beautiful on, smooth, light coverage. I don't have a lot of dark spots or acne issues. I do have freckles and some redness, but not crazy. This coverage is perfect for me for daily wear. It plays with my other products. I don't get weird grainy break down around my nose, chin, and under my glasses at the bridge of my nose like I do with other foundations. It will last my 16 hour day and still look great, no fading or disappearing act. If you need full coverage, you can skip this one but if you just need an even out with a natural look, this is your girl. I thought Fenty EZ Dropz were the best thing ever until I tried this foundation, and now I won't touch the EZ Dropz again. * I go to a huge college in the South where it is often above 100 degrees outside, and I will wear this to football games and sit out in the direct sunlight and sweat for hours and it still looks just as good post game as when I put it on! I love this product and swear by it! It is expensive but I think it is worth the price. My only complaint is that I think they could give you a little more product for the price point, but the product itself is just so great I won't stop buying it!"

The hydrating camo CC cream is perfection. I got shade 205N and it is the perfect light neutral for fair skin olive toned girlies. I will absolutely be buying this again. This is my new favorite foundatjon. * I like the product. It is a dupe for the IT one. * I've repurchased three times now. I didn't like the original Camo CC cream bc I have dry skin, but this one is phenomenal with proper skin prep!! (moisturizer, hyaluronic acid, etc). I'm running low and plan to repurchase * So it looks good right when you apply it but after an hour or so it separates and makes your face look patchy and blotchy. Horrible, what a waste of money. Will end up throwing this away. * I use this CC cream foundation nearly everyday for work and I love it! This CC cream works well with all of the primers that I own including the ELF power grip as suggested by the brand itself. I have oily/combo skin and this sits well on my skin and lasts for hours when paired with a setting powder. My skin feels hydrated, my complexion looks even and I love the added benefit of SPF! Overall excellent product that I will continue to repurchase!! * Applies evenly and stays on well thru out the day * I like this product"

It doesnt cake up where i have dry patches and will lasg all day! I cant say enough good things about this product! * I've tried a couple different tinted moisturizers and this is the first one I actually liked enough to repurchase. It gives the perfect amount of coverage and it's good to wear year-round. * For a tinted moisturizer, it has awesome coverage. The color blended wonderfully and required very little to achieve the perfect look. * I really like the medium coverage and dewy finish of this tinted moisturizer. It makes my skin look great BUT in the fair and light shades it only comes in neutral undertone. My skin is cool so it looks a tad bit too yellow on my skin. Its not hugely noticeable but enough that I can't continue to use it. I really wish it had options for undertone. * As I have now approached my 40's, I have really enjoyed wearing lighter weight, dewy finish, more hydrating serum-like foundations. My skin tends to be rosacea prone/redness prone esp as a fair skinned person. I also get quite dry and flaky so the last thing I want in a foundation is for it to accentuate any patchy areas or flakes. I tested this formula out in Ulta back in March and have been using it on and off over the last 7 months. I really enjoy it as it is very hydrating once you complete your skin prep, you can apply very little- as it goes a long way: and you can blend it out perfectly with a brush or a sponge; even your fingers if needed. I personally, prefer a brush. The only con is that 10 was a bit too light and 20 was a little too dark of an undertone for me-but works for my skin tone in the summer. It's not SUPER noticeable, but I tend to go for more of a ""pinky"" undertone, so more in between shades would be nice. I like how this gives you a natural, dewy look and you are able to build up as needed without looking cakey. Once your face is complete, it wears extremely well IMO, and doesnt settle into any lines that I've noticed. It's a great option and I'm impressed, would definitely recommend to anyone on the fence thinking about it. Just make sure you get the correct color match. :) * Amazing coverage, no creasing, no smudging. Doesn't feel like anything on my face. * Amazing beautiful coversge for dry skin. However its kind of thick and can cause breakouts. Its also easily transferable. Must use a setting powder or spray if you dont want it getting on anything. I do still love the coverage though.  Needs more shade options too"

Something that most products lack for women my age is matte/ modest glow. I highly recommend if you have combo skin. * I'm not a makeup person but this product doesn't feel like makeup! I need to even put the redness and tone and not settle in the creases... Found the perfect shade for the first time ever. This is the answer! Easy to put on on the morning and isn't shiny. Win win win! * Love the coverage, texture, and overall wear * Had to stop using it after giving it a couple of tries. The smell was horrendous, and the foundation is so liquidy that my face felt wet all day, to the point I worried it was running down my face. * I've never had a makeup break my face out so bad.  I've used doublewear and I never had any issues, but this one was terrible.  The spf makes it so greasy and the smell is icky. * Absolutely love the ease of using this product and the results. Feels like you're wearing nothing at all, super easy to apply in minutes, and gives enough coverage without feeling caked on. I'm not a makeup person at all, but I'm so glad the store rep introduced me to this product. I have melasma and while it doesn't completely cover it, it does smooth out my coloring so it's no longer noticeable. Nice satin lightweight finish. * One of the best foundations I have used, base is so smooth and also has spf 45."

I can apply it with my hands, brush, sponge and it always looks so beautiful and natural. The color match is perfect and it lasts throughout my entire 8 hour work day and beyond. I cannot recommend this enough. I also do have oily/combo skin. * The price of this foundation is ridiculous, but I keep buying it because for my skin it is the best foundation out there. I just love it. I apply with a sponge and it looks beautiful all day long. * The foundation has great coverage with a very light feeling. * I don't wear makeup often but this foundation is the best that I have seen on me.  I receive compliments every time I wear it.  I have BR42 and it makes my face look bright - I love the color. * I've really tried to like this makeup but after continually trying it still burns and by the afternoon my face has flaky peeling patches. * The only time I get compliments on my skin is when I'm wearing this. It's expensive but lasts a long time and a little goes a long way. Its the perfect weight for me—light to medium coverage. * I like this foundation but I don't love it especially for the price. I don't find it luminous at all; a natural finish at best. I enjoy it more if I add a little oil when applying. It's a solid medium coverage but almost leans slightly matte to me. I had a very difficult time finding the right shade. There really wasn't a great match for me but BD21 was acceptable. I have the same shade in the Healthy Glow foundation but the shade differs with the formula. I like the Healthy Glow better as it looks more natural and it's less expensive. Still on the fence about this one. Might not be glowy enough for me."

Will melt into your skin. I use a foundation brush to put on and use MAC prep and prime before and after the application. I love this stuff! * This foundation probably works good on clear oily skin but on acne prone, textured skin it looks dry and really exaggerates the pores. Looks like chalk on your face * I love this foundation. I always get compliments for how seamless and smooth it appears on my skin. It also blends well and you can build it up to be full coverage. I reccommend 100%! * I think I need to buy 2 at a time and combine them to get the right match, and I can't afford to. I keep trying other foundations but nothing I've tried covers as well and is as easy to apply. It doesn't oxidize on me or seem to increase breakouts. Can get greasy and shiny if you are sweating. * I really wish Smashbox didn't get rid of the studio fix to replace with this garbage! Attempting to build your coverage feels like decades, the foundation does not spread and blend well. Very splotchy after only a few hours and dry and flaky looking. Takes a lot longer to oxidize as well and for the true color to come through. 

I wore studio fix religiously for so long and unfortunately Smashbox has lost a customer. * I've been looking for the right shade and I've finally found it. I love this make-up, coming from someone who has tried a few different brands. * I needed new foundation, but I needed something that didn't make me feel like I had makeup on AND something that would hold up to humidity. Smashbox Always On was the perfect solution!"

Does not clog my pores nor does it affect my existing acne in a negative way. Smooths my skin out and looks natural which I love. Will definitely repurchase and recommend to friends and family especially those who struggle with finding an acne friendly skin tint. * I really wanted to love this skin tint, but it totally broke me out. Apart from that, on the first layer of application it looks god awful on my acne prone skin. A second layer however, looks good. When I wear this skin tint, i always have a problem with having little streak marks on my nose from where i apply blush at the end of my routine. I don't have this problem with  ther foundations. The packaging also makes this product super messy. * There's a reason why everyone hypes this skin tint. It has been the best foundation I've ever bought. Will definitely keep repurchasing this. It covers my hyperpigmentation without that heavy foundation feel and it last so long. I love this product. * If you're looking for light coverage this is for you! I use this as an everyday foundation just to have some color! You are able to build on it. It does have a slight orange hue but with some blush and translucent powder, you're good to go! * I absolutely hate the dropper. The dropper is messy. Won't buy this again or any foundation with a dropper applicator. * This is not a skin tint. I have maturing skin, so I'm trying to step away from full coverage. This is a great step down into light/medium coverage without the shock. Dries down, wears well and it's unscented. If it continues to wear like this, I'll repurchase * I really wanted to try this skin tint but its unusable! Its way to orange the jump from 120-129 is insane!

I stopped wearing makeup because foundation always felt too heavy and settled on my face. This did not. Makeup looked great all night. * Color matches beautifully to whats shown online, lightweight. Light coverage but also buildable. I use one pump amd than do a powder foundation by maybelline and lasts all day. This may not cover acne prone skin, but it definitely helped a little with redness on my cheeks. A good product all around, it doesnt feel heavy. * I love this foundation and have used it for years! The shade I use matches me perfectly and the liquid is very blendable and feels light on my skin. I only have one complaint and its about the pump. I miss the old screw-on caps! The pump wastes so much product because you can't really control how much is coming out and can't get all of the liquid out especially if you're getting close to the bottom and shake it up. With the old screw-on cap, you had control of how much you want to get out and you could get all of the product out. The only downfall of that was possibly dropping the bottom, but I waste so much product and have to buy more often which is just messed up L'Oreal. I love this product though and will stick with it so long as the formula and color stay the same. * It is a very much affordable foundation and feels smooth on the skin. I like it very much because it blends almost perfectly on my skin * Ive tried so many foundations, high end and cheap, and this is one of the best hands down! It stays on 13+ hours, no creases, doesn't ever look oily! Just so good! * Ive been usinf this for 3 weeks and my skin has gotten OILIER if possible. Completelt reflective after an hour or 2 all around my tzone. And is does NOT stay on well. I use with estee lauder primer because i had some left AND i use settinf spray and powder around my nose and forehead. Would not recommend."

Full coverage long lasting! * Reason for 3 star, I didn't like the color on me * I really love this foundation - it goes on smooth and feels weightless. However, I don't believe that the color is true to the liquid foundation. Initially, yes, but it seems to oxidize within 30-60 minutes, making you look a slightly different shade/darker. I wear a combination of 2N1 and 2N2. The 2N1 powder went on great but now my skin looks  very pink compared to my neck. I never have this issue with the liquid version. * Got this off the sale rack and it is a life changing product! * Perfect shade with great finish, but was an oil slick after a couple of hours even with a mattifying primer.

I am fair to light with a neutral leaning slightly warm complexion and I don't think there is a great match for me in this product. I did not find this product to look very natural or give me any sort of radiance. I felt it looked semi matte rather than a natural finish. Coverage was fine-light to medium as expected. I much prefer Chanel's Healthy Glow foundation. I have mature skin and think perhaps this foundation is better suited to a younger customer. I didn't dislike it but I would not repurchase it. For me it looked rather flat no matter how I prepped my skin. * This is a fantastic foundation! It's lightweight and  leaves me looking naturally flawless. I will say it doesn't completely cover dark spots/acne but I am personally fine with that- nothing a little concealer can't help with. I will definitely be repurchasing. * Wonderful product! * This is the best foundation that I have tried in at least the last 5 years of searching for ""the one"".  Not too heavy or too light. Not cakey and does not settle into my fine lines. This foundation lasts throughout the workday and well into the evening. Definitely worth the price. Finally!  I've found the one!! * Here's a quick review you can use for Dior foundation at Ulta:

""I absolutely love how smooth the Dior foundation applies to my skin! It blends effortlessly, giving me a flawless finish that feels lightweight yet provides great coverage. The formula feels luxurious, and it lasts all day without creasing or feeling heavy. Whether you're going for a natural look or building it up for full glam, this foundation is a game-changer. Highly recommend trying it out—you won't be disappointed!"" * I absolutely love the matte version of this in 3.5 N and thought with the winter coming up, the natural would be better. First of, the shade is not the same, a couple shade lighter, has a white cast and doesn't last all day. After 14 hrs, there is barely anything left when I use my make up remover. Shouldve stick with the matte. That was superior over this. * The color is a great match at 2N and it gives a soft glow that I wanted. However, in terms of ""lightweight"", I can feel it on my face. If you have dry skin and look for lightweight, check out Chanel Healthy Glow. Dior Forever Nude is a different look - if you have dry skin and look for a matte look with a soft glow, this is for you. However, there is a change that you might not like it due to the fragrance and slight oxidization. It didn't work for me but it might work for you."

I tried this on a whim and love it! Its easy to apply (recommend blending out with a sponge) and gives my face a really nice finish without looking like I am overly made up.  It also feels really great in my skin- like nothing at all.  I set this with a very light layer of pressed powder in my t-zone and it wears wonderfully throughout the day.  The shade I got was just a bit off but I can make it work though I am going to order another shade to see if that matches more perfectly. * The closest I've ever cone to giving a foundation 5 stars. While I will absolutely buy again, I can't use it on my eyelids or directly under my eyes or my nose will run all day. Perfect amount of coverage. Doesn't settle into lines & wrinkles. * I really like this foundation.  It's not too thick but still covers up my age spots and makes my face look and feel soft and fresh. * I absolutely love this foundation. I have been using it since the summer when I watched a review video of it. It hydrates, provides great coverage and hydrates perfectly. I've not experienced cakiness or setting like other foundations I've tried. * Mac always delivers! Skin looks glowy and smooth. This stayed on all day.

Thank you Serena for this huge score! * This product blends in perfect with my skin. It looks like I'm not really wearing makeup. I love how it gives me natural look. * Isnt the founder herself an athlete? Assuming her makeup brand would stay on through workouts or training.. it doesn't. Matter of fact, I applied this and it was fine. Until literally 2 hours later, its already coming off, patchy, sliding off, and parts of my face no linger have the skin tint anymore. Returning this. 

It doesnt give me the option to add the photo but you can clearly see i have random patches of ""skin tint"" on my face when i applied it all over my face. * I love love love this product. I'm fair/light and bought the second lightest shade 30. It's a bit too light but I can make it with a bit of bronzer & blush. Next time I buy it I'll get a slightly deeper shade. Yes, I will absolutely be repurasing it!

I also have combo skin with a lot of redness, sensitivity, dryness on my cheeks, oiliness & large pores on my t-zone.  I bought this skin tint in the summer and was surprised at how well it held up throughout a hot day. Now I'm the bitter cold, between the dry air  outside & the dry air from my furnace this is a godsend. It blends extremely well in both my dry and oily areas, builds well without emphasizing texture or looking flaky. If they ever discontinued this product I'd be devastated. * This is far and away the best skin tint I've ever used! It's so lightweight and applies super easily … perfect for those days when I dont feel like doing a full beat and just want a natural glow. Also works well under other products. Serena did her big one with this!"

Ive had this a year, use other things, and end up back at this. I have a combo-oily skin/dehydrated skin type, which Ive noticed seems to be a theme among the positive reviews. It has great coverage and the finish is matte, but not flat matte. It also wears fantastically all day. A lot of other foundations look alright for 6-8 hours and then fall apart on me, but not this one! I do find it looks best when you allow your skincare to really sink into your skin before applying this. Id also go without the primer - unless you let it sink in. You just dont want too much moisture or anything sitting on top of your skin to let this foundation do its job, but other than that I dont find it finicky. 
The packaging is nice and feels luxe so for the money its a great formula and and bottle. * This absolutely my favorite foundation ever! It matches my skin perfectly, it's very buildable. It sits beautifully on my face! * I was so excited to try this foundation, but the applicator was broken when it arrived. I have never exchanged or returned anything so I looked that up and apparently you have to go into the store. My local stores don't have my shade so I had to return the foundation, and I was asked to rebuy it. It doesn't make sense to return a product, wait to get the refund, and then repurchase it. This would be acceptable if refunds were immediate, but they are not. I have been an Ulta customer for years and this experience was very disappointing. * I read some reviews about  foundation cracking but also others that work good, I decided to try but quite disappointed I think this is not good at all x mature skins. I mixed a little with clear prime but after a few mins showed discolored  and cracking looked bad * The hourglass ambient soft glow foundation is the best I've found yet. I normally wear Estee Lauder's Stay in Place foundation, which I've always relied on. I was getting tired of how dry my face looked throughout the course of the day, so I decided to choose something with a radiant/natural finish. However, I did not want to sacrifice coverage. I chose this foundation in the shade 3, which has natural undertones. Oh my goodness was this the best decision ever. This has great coverage and lasts all day. Im from an area with high humidity and this stuff just does not budge, nor is it too drying. I have oily skin as well and I do not get any shine at all when paired with a silicone primer and CT Airbrush Powder. I have gotten sooooo many compliments since I began wearing this foundation. I highly recommend. * I am in love with this foundation. I am shade 8. I pair it with Glow Recipe moisturizer, Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer, Laura Mercier loose powder.  I am good for the whole day. Gorgeous finish! I am really oily btw. * M so happy I picked this foundation, it's hydrating 2 pumps give good coverage"

My daughter found this for me and so far i absolutely love it. The color match is perfect.  It goes on so soft and smooth and there is not a weird or strong smell. * Good coverage. * The first time gave me a rash so I waited a couple of months to make sure it was this and I tried it again and gave a red bumps all over my face. I'm not the only one. There's a lot of bad reviews w the same effect. * Excellent powder foundation for older women.  I don't know why my color doesn't seem to be available anymore though.  What's going on with the limited shade offerings?  Fenty still has all 50 shades on their website! * Ive been using this powder in shade 150 since it came out. All of a sudden theres no lighter shades? Not even one around the color ive been using. I've probably went through 10 of these compacts, and am beyond disappointed. Def gives me the ick for the brand!! * Perfect match for my skin tone. * I did the color match online and they matched me with a Shane that is not even available anymore. At the store I matched with 210 and the consultant said they are not going to carry that shade anymore. why would this supposedly inclusive brand cut all these different shades from their lineup? Now I guess I have to find another brand to buy powder from."

It's extremely light weight, blends in quite easily, doesn't look weird over textured skin, lasts a good amount of time, and has a natural finish without looking too glowy. I would rate this a 4.5 if I could though, because I really dislike the packaging. The wrapper is really hard to remove and makes you peel of the label in order to be able to access the product, and the bottom of the product is bulbous, so it can barely stand up straight. It's not enough to make me stop using the product though, the formula really is incredible, I just would love the packaging to be updated a bit as it seems extremely cheap, even for a drugstore brand. * This product is perfect for those who are minimalists with their make up routine and want minimal coverage. It looks so nautral and evens out my skin tone while covering flaws. I really do love! * FINALLY…. A product that is super thin, lightweight, light coverage, AND works for my combo/oily skin! I will buy this forever! * I really didn't know how this would look on me, I usually use more silicone based foundation so... But this one was very nice. I did have to put it on the back of my hand and give a little mix first then apply it to my face. I tried pumping it directly on my skin and it didn't blend right.. This foundation is definitely not beginner friendly.  I'm sure everyone is different but this is the best method for me. Also I have dry, mature, skin. It wore nicely for about 4 hours. After that I needed a touch up. But it's definitely a nice light coverage!! * This stuff is the definition of ""your skin but better."" I've tried SO many tinted serums, wasted so much money on $40+ brands for them to be useless. I've found the easiest way to apply this is directly to your face, then blend with fingers, then blend out with a beauty blender. 

I have sensitive skin and rosacea, this is the first product I've ever used that didn't irritate or break out my skin. And weirdly, despite having pretty light coverage, this does an amazing job at covering my redness. Covering actually might not be the right word, it's more like toning almost. It doesn't look like I have anything on, yet still seems to almost eliminate my redness (which has always been severe). I have no clue how this works, I swear it's magic because  I cannot understand it. 

Coverage is somewhat buildable, but definitely meant to be used lightly. It'll get cakey if you set it with powder, and then if it gets wet it'll lift really weird, but I don't ever feel the need to use powder. Powder blush and brozer work fine over it, just not setting your whole face. I'll go all day just with this and not get oily at all, it doesn't slide off like other tinted serums, and when it does wear it looks really natural. A bit sticky at first but it will dry down, and feels like there's nothing on your face! Definitely is somewhat waterproof, by far the most oit of any other product like this I've tried. 

I've worn this to bed many times without any breakouts, and in the morning I truly can't tell whether there's any of it left on my face (in a good way), because my skin looks better after wearing this. Probably the bakuchiol, which is what prompted me to buy it bc I already use a serum with that every night that I love. 

And again, I don't have great skin to begin with, and I've gotten endless compliments on my skin since I started using this. People saying my rosacea looks better, pores, texture, etc. 

I don't bother with reviews much, but man, every time I use this stuff, every time I look in the mirror I can't stop thinking how good my skin looks, and how natural. * The first few times I used this I thought it looked beautiful on the skin when first applied. But noticed after being on my skin for a little bit my skin felt tight. I should have looked at the ingredients first. Benzyl Alcohol is pretty high on the list of ingredients. unfortunately, it makes my already dry skin drier. * I've used this a few times and have been loving it on my no makeup makeup days when I don't want a full coverage base. I get hormonal acne along my chin so it tends to leave acne scars, so this doesn't fully cover them up but it still gives a natural finish. 

It leaves my skin looking healthy, covers my spider veins, provides light coverage under my eyes in place of concealer, and gives me an all around healthy glow. 

I do 2 pumps and rub it between my hands first then spread evenly onto my face before using a brush to buff it out. I recommend this if you're starting out with makeup or if you prefer a natural finish."

It's the perfect amt of coverage, doesn't crease, wear time is great and NEVER breaks me out. Literally using it till I die * I have tried any different kinds of foundation and found Colour Pop to be the best. My skin has never looked this flawless since I was in my 20's I'm 57 now. * I've been using this product for a few months in the spring and summer. As far as coverage, its pretty good. One pump is more than enough for a full face makeup, so it lasted me for a while. It doesnt budge when you set it and can last all day, even on a hot day. The downside is that it does oxidize so you end up a little orange. It can also settle on any dry patches of skin so you definitely have to have a good and hydrated base. I woundt wear this in the winter due to it being a bit dry when its set. I wont be repurchasing. * I feel like ColourPop consistently delivers great products at budget friendly prices. I'm 34 and my skin has been changing recently, and my go to great foundations are now cakey/settling in creases. I've been on the hunt for a new go to foundation that is lightweight, buildable coverage and blends beautifully. This foundation is effortless so far, offering good cover while blending my skin tone for a light finish. So far I haven't had it settling into fine lines or accentuating pores. 
Unless anything horrific happens to my sensitive skin, this will be a new go to for me! * Super cakey and it broke me out. I love skincare so my base is nice and moisturized but this foundation does NOT sit well. Also oxidized into an orange color. * I have tried every foundation out there, I wore Estee Lauder for many years. This foundation is so smooth and it doesn't budge all day it doesn't transfer and stays put. I wet my foundation brush and I use one pump and I dot my forehead in each cheek and then I lightly blend in with my brush and then I put concealer around my eyes powder my face and it stays put all day. * No! Dont buy this. Youll end up returning. Its orange when it dries, super cakey on skin but comes out of bottle watery. Product is super weird. Its blotchy and oily on skin. You cant set it or the concealer or itll be cakey. It creases everywhere."

Even when I used a blurring primer it still sunk into my pores to the point where it looked like I had dots all over my face. I say try it to see if it works for you but this was my experience with it. If you don't like a strong sunscreen smell, this product has just that. * Goes on smoothly. Good coverage. * I have no idea why this product is online only in my area! It' should be in every store. Fantastic for maturing skin. Doesn't accentuate fine lines or settle in creases. * i absolutely love the finish of this product and the way it feels. it is buildable and so so comfortable to wear. it makes me hesitant to try another foundation bc this formula really hits all the marks for me! 
i personally prefer a dewy and natural look, and something that evens out my skin tone. i find that other makeup sits well on top of it, the only time ive seen it move around because of another product is when i tried to put the saie illuminator on top. if your preferences are like mine i think you will like this product !! * I don't know why this isn't sold in stores! It's absolutely fantastic! I don't normally like wearing liquid foundation because it feels heavy but this one is so light and actually does provide good coverage without the heaviness. I have plenty of acne scars and discoloration and it makes my skin appear almost flawless - basically solid coverage without feeling like full coverage heavy foundation. I don't even need to wear concealer under my eyes or elsewhere when I use this. I like to apply it by squeezing a few lines onto each area of my face directly from the tube and then work it in with a brush. I go back in with a dab of liquid bronzer to give my face dimension. If I have time I'll let it dry 5-10 min and set very lightly by pushing in some setting powder. It ends up with a nice dewy finish but if you go heavier on the setting powder you can get closer to matte if that's what you like. Lastly, I wear the ivory shade which works in combination with the bronzer but would otherwise be too pale (I'm a 2N1 in Estee Lauder powder in winter and 2N2 in summer). I just ordered the golden ivory in this product for summer but again, with bronzer the ivory still works for me all year. * I wanted to love this! It goes on very smoothly, which is great. But I wouldn't say it is buildable because it's so oily it never dries enough for a second coat—if you wanted. About 2pm I look so oily bc my powder has dissolved. I tried it about a month and kept wondering why my face was always shiny—and felt oily. I thought it was new moisturizer but it's not. It's this. If you have dry skin—this would be perfect! * I can't believe how great this product is at such a reasonable price point. My skin is very dry and  so most foundations were settling into my fine lines or emphasizing scaliness. This foundation does not do that and it is incredibly hydrating. I like natural coverage and this does that perfectly but I think it could be buildable, too. I find that it does transfer pretty easily but I think that's the trade-off for it being so moisturizing. I just a put a little powder to set it and that seems to help."

It is a bit pricey for myself but overall good.. * Feels like im not wearing anything while covering everything! Blends like a dream. Acne safe! Only foundation in a long time that has not broken me out. * This is definitely one of my favorite foundations! It can be lightweight or built up for more coverage.

It was super easy to shade match and literally loved how smooth it is on my skin. I have tons of acne scars on my skin and never found something that would cover them with out looking cakey. Hence the reason why I don't wear foundations. But I've gotten compliments on how smooth my skin looks since using this foundation! * Honestly this product shocked me! I tried it in stores and loved the shade match. After using it a couple times, I really like the product. It is light and easy to use. It blends out nice and I do not think it looks cakey. I do not wear foundation everyday but when I do this is a great foundation! * First time trying a new makeup brand wanting more coverage. Next day got a massive infection from the makeup.

I absolutely love this stuff! * I have good skin and this product was recommended by an Ulta associate, so I tried it. I wish I had returned it, but I tried to make it work. It made my skin look pasty and oily like I was sick.  I tried mixing it with other foundations, because I really wanted to love it. It's Chanel! Still, it just ruined everything I tried it with. I tried it as a highlight, and it was ok for that, but not good. I put it in my purse as an emergency foundation, but in the GA heat, the beads melted together. Overall, it was just a mess for me. I really regret this purchase. * Yes, it's pricy but it's doing the job of 3 different products: eye primer, concealer, and foundation. It's also very easy to take when traveling. 

How to use it as a concealer: use your finger and tab it under your eye
How to use it as a foundation: use the small brush that comes with it and contour it on your face. Then use a foundation brush or beauty blender to ""blend it out"" (don't just use a regular foundation brush - it might be too much)
How to use it as a eye primer: use the small brush that comes it it and apply it on your eyelid before applying eyeshadow. 

Another trick: while this is a natural finish, you can add a subtle glow by applying Chanel liquid highlighter underneath (as a primer). * I really like Chanel's original Water Fresh product, but it's too bulky to travel with. This version has way better packaging and has more coverage so it's particularly good for work and event travel. But, oddly, it looks and feels drying on my (normal, slightly sensitive) skin. It highlights tiny fine lines I didn't know I had. The formula is not significantly different than the original, it just has more pigment, and the whole schtick is hyalauronic acid and hydration, so I don't know why it has this effect. It's noticeable, so I have to beef up my skincare accordingly in order to wear it and apply it while my moisturizer/SPF are still tacky. May not be suitable for folks with dry or textured skin, or folks who find these issues too fussy. * I love this foundation. It's light and feels nourishing. I was using a matte foundation (Chanel) for many years due to oily skin, but it started feeling kind of dry on my 60 y/o skin. My skin feels young again. And it glows. 
This one is a keeper! * Unlike any other foundation or concealer that I've tried.  Literally, this is magic.  Evens tone, covets flaws, smooths every textural flaw, diminishes pores, seems to moisturize any dry patches, and feels like I'm wearing no makeup.  It's absolute must-try for anyone over 50yo and doesn't love the typical look of foundation. Yes, I'm ordering a backup."

I have tried many high end brands and keep coming back to my juvias place! Packaging for all their products are just beautiful! * I bought this in store because of an employees recommendation, got shade matched and it matches my skin tone and undertones beautifully. however, that didnt last very long because it IMMEDIATELY turns orange. I put it on my face and after less than ten minutes, I look super orange and my face doesn't match my neck anymore. full coverage and beautiful shade match but the immediate oxidizing completely ruins it for me * Ive been using this foundation for several years and it has become one of my faves! I have dark hyperpigmentation spots underneath my chin that I'm very self conscious about but this full coverage foundation covers all of it flawlessy! Its very velvety and blends effortlessly. The only issue I have with it is that it transfers easily when its touched by your hand or clothing.

Only need a little bit, one pump and get a nice medium coverage for redness, etc. * I love this as a foundation. I use a very small amount because it does tend to oxidize a bit if you build too much product in my experience. Great natural look. * I love the light as air feeling and medium coverage, but it clogged my pores. I will use this up on my undereyes only.

I have been searching for a foundation like this for YEARSSS. (I have super sensitive combo skin leaning dry. Liquid foundations always look terrible on me after 1 hour. I do great skin prep too!) Lightweight, breathable foundation, quality ingredients, minimal ingredients, fragrance free, light to medium coverage, skin like finish, 6 to 8 hour wear still looking flawless, doesnt dry my skin out, doesnt irritate my skin, doesnt cling to dry patches, COLOR MATCH ON POINT, skincare ingredients, AFFORADABLE, anti-pollution (I live in SLC, worst air quality/pollution here) I  literally cried when i first put this foundation on i was so blown away at how perfect it was. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NEVER EVER discontinue or reformulate. I am a customer for life and this foundation has changed my life. * very skin like finish! no fuss foundation. * This is an undetectable foundation on my mature, dry skin, though it can build easily for extra coverage. I will just add additional drops on those darker spots, which still peek through but look more homogenous. But coverage is not my main concern, so this winner maintains the slightly dewy glow over a well -prepped skin base, still looking un made-up by the end of the day. Also, goes over mineral sunscreen flawlessly. IMO it is on par with Haus Labs, Nars Radiant LIght, MUF reboot; my other favs. I am trying another shade, though am happy with Katey, the match I found via the skin models- so that's my recommendation for finding your shade, rather than the description. It is on sale, so... TRY IT! * I'm assuming this foundation is on clearance because of quality issues… I received my order and the formula is completely separated and cannot be mixed back together to a good consistency. * I was so surprised when i first used it, my skin looked like skin. I like a lightweight natiral finish and this gives me exactly that! It also stays on all day/night, only thing is that it oxidizes a little bit but not wnything drastic. Has been my go-to foundation for over a year already! * good match for hard shade (fair/light olive) and good for sensitive/acne prone/scar/texture skin. decent coverage but feels light and natural. but doesnt really set (makeup smudges on my cat) & taking the top off pulls the entire pump out sometimes * I have used this foundation for a few years and it's never let me down. I fluctuate between a range of their lighter, cool toned shades depending on the time of year. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. A few things I've learned along the way: 

*A thin base layer will cover most spots and uneven tones. If you need more coverage, then spot treat with a little more foundation.
*It pairs beautifully on top of Nudestix tinted sunscreen.
*Applies well with brushes or sponges, but better with your fingers.
*A stippling, dabbing motion is the best method to apply the thin layers.

I'm 41, and I receive many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation, and I feel like I look more youthful with this on. I will definitely continue to repurchase!"

Have loved Complexion Rescue, but would need to use concealer on redness around/on nose & chin. No need for concealer with this (sometimes do a tiny 2nd layer around nose & chin). It has great skincare benefits, looks natural & lasts 😊 * I usually use bareMinerals BarePro 24 hr wear, but did not see it available anywhere.  This foundation is very watery, makes my face look shiny, and the make up has an off odor to it.  I am still on the hunt for BarePro 24 hr. wear. * I've worn this brand for years. Felt clean, looked flawless and got so many compliments…

The new formula is horrible: thin, oily, coverage doesnt last (or really exist), and it broke me out within minites of putting it on (whole face was red and inflamed). 

The color match is totally off too. It is not the same as my old one at all. Looks incredibly cheap when on as well. 

So sad that I know have to find a new brand - true all over face color was the best (now gone too) and their loose powser I have no dount will change soon too. * This foundation is okay. It looks good for 2 hours then starts fo separate. I have oily and textured skin, it has broken me out. I think itll be good for a little while only. * This was my first time trying bare minerals foundation, and I am genuinely surprised by how bad it is.  It settles right into every fine like and wrinkle within minutes and makes them look much bigger and more prominent than they are.  It's very thin and greasy, and it doesn't stay put for even a couple hours. I wore it to a meeting and I was horrified afterwards when I saw that my foundation was visibly smudged and smeared by my sunglasses on my short commute to work.  For reference I wore it over bare minerals primer and under another setting spray that normally works well; skin was well-moisturized before application and I used a blender sponge to apply.  I'm 41 and I've been wearing drugstore foundations for most of my life.  I have tried many over the decades but this might be the worst foundation I have ever tried.  Very overpriced for extremely low quality. * I really love the coverage. It is smooth, light and moisturizing with out feeling oiling. * You changed the colors of Bare Minerals liquid foundation. I wear Sandstone 16. The color that supposedly you changed the name to medium 30 warm. Is way not the match. I'm taking this back. Who advised you that it would make the consumer happy. Now I have to look for a cheap one till I can match it with a different company. Yuk!"

I've tried almost every foundation out there, including the expensive brands, only to buy this one on a whim because it was one of the few I hadn't tried. I'm always looking for a medium/full coverage foundation that doesn't settle into  my fine lines & wrinkles & provide good coverage. When it first came, I noticed it was super watery & I was disappointed.  BUT THEN I put it on my face, & I literally look at least 10-15 years younger. I am in disbelief in the coverage- and no settling in lines & it actually stayed on! * I like a more sheer and glowy foundation, and this one is perfect. It's so light weight but also is buildable, and it makes my skin look hydrated and glowy. * I love it * I can't believe this has a low rating! This is stunning! This is proof that other companies could charge less if they wanted to because this is an exquisite product for an incredible price! * Trying to figure out the best application.  So far, putting on a light layer with a brush, followed by another layer with a sponge, seems to work pretty well.  It is a thinner formula, so it doesn't look cakey. * This has a slippery feel,  but not as silicone feeling as the nyx . It's a sheer lightweight foundation. I like it. I wear it at least 1 or 2 times a week. * this foundation is exactly what it says. SKIN SILK. when applying this foundation it goes on so effortlessly with such a pretty coverage. its a medium coverage which i love especially with acne prone skin. i feel like when you have a full coverage foundation your face worh acne prone skin it can look so cakey and gross so light to medium is ideal for me. but this foundation is beautful!! i really recommend using the elf power grip primer before!! the foundation base after setting with loose powder and spraying with the morphe setting spray is absolutely gorgeous ive never had such a smooth looking base before, it truly is skin silk !!! it definitely is long lasting as well !! ive had my makeup on all day for approximately 12 hours and my makeup still looks reasonably good for how much i touch my face!! i will say tho if your face is on the oilyer side you probably will have creasing! this is a dewyer set foundation id say if you like your face more matte id suggest setting your face with loose powder, spraying and then setting again with powder after!! that always helped me when my face is on the more oily side! i have normal to oily skin so it goes back and forth sometimes. other than that i have nothing bad to say about this foundation. there is also an amazing selection of shade matches!! so many undertones available!! < 33"

I enjoy the citrus scent of both. My skin feels great after application. The coverage is light and sheer but lasts. I apply it with a beauty blender sponge. I took a star off because coverage appears patchy on my neck. The packaging is easy to use. * My mother, in her mid 50's, absolutely loves this product. It feels great, has buildable coverage and has a great color to it. It looks great on older skin and has a very youthful glow. * After reading some of these reviews, I'm seeing that I'm not the only one with the streaking issue. For reference: I'm 41 with combination skin. 

I tried this on in-store. Wasn't in love with it, but Pür changed their tinted moisturizer's colors and they no longer looked good on my skin.

This tint has almost no coverage. It is watery and streaks. Be careful because it will just run out of the tube. It also clings to my dry spots (mostly my chin and around the nose).  I definitely moisturize before I put it on. I've tried it with a brush. I've tried it with a sponge. I've tried it with my fingertips. But it's all the same. It just looks horrible and I could not recommend this. * Super greasy and streaky whether you use a brush or sponge. I understand its a skin tint but has zero coverage. Separating on my nose and chin and will cling on to dry spots. 0/10 recommend * Left a rash after being on my skin for 2 minutes. The burning started and I washed it off immediately, and this is what I was left with. There is virtually no coverage. Buy a tinted sunscreen, or a better skin tint like the one from Ilia. * Should have taken the reviews seriously… If I had kept the box it would be returned…. It is a watery mess… There is a chemical odor… And the color is off…probably due to the consistency… I used the previous version of this product for years…and am extremely disappointed with this ""new and improved"" version of the product…. Nothing stays the same… What was wrong with old Tinted Moisturizer that it needed to be changed…watered down…? This was a total waste of money… this tinted moisturizer will go down drain where it belongs…! (Don't set the tube in the upright position on the cap…it will be a mess when opened…) * At first glance this seemed promising but about only and hour the product caked and separated on my skin, this isnt the worst part. It gave me a severe reaction, im now walking around with a painful rash on my face. I will be returning this."

I exchanged it twice ,each time getting a lighter shade, and no matter what always ended up with an orange face.  Also not pressed very well, for eyeshadow i dont mind it not being pressed hard but for face products i prefer powders to be pressed harder so they last longer. Easily went through it in a month.  Looked okay on the face not bad not great finish wise. * I use this as a bronzor. So affordable and a great product. This is the best packaging in my personal collection. Feels luxurious. * Ive been using this for a couple weeks since i got it and so far its been a really nice powder foundation. I previously used the old ulta powder foundation in the gray packaging but they since reformulated and im unsure how a lack of talc will look after the horror that was the essence 16hr powder.

Its lightweight, doesnt settle, i was able to find a workable shade but i may need a winter shade. I like that the back has holes for the breathability and i also like the square component as it gives u a more precise sponge and larger mirror however, the way you lift up to get the sponge is a little annoying. I find that it last pretty long however its hard to tell how much as its already not the most coverage. Im a male and find this dosnt work well over trimmed/shaved hair, it kinda builds up weird and looks spotty other powders typically don't althought maybe im putting too much on, its not terrible i can work around it. Overall i would reccomend this powder! 4/5 * Worked perfectly on my skin all summer, didn't even need to prime. * This product is so fine and pwdery, the fallout is CRAZY, and there is, in my opinion, zero coverage. I love Juvia's Place products but this was a flop. I have the ELF powder foundation which is half the price and has quadruple the coverage. Love other products but this is a total no."

I love the coverage for my skin and you can mix if the color does not match at a great price! * I bought this foundation being of all the good reviews. Unfortunately the moment i put it on my skin the color was immediately to warm for my complexion, i got the heavenly honey. It looked WAY to orange and when i washed it off it looked like pure orange on my skin. It showed every ounce of texture on my skin (i dont have much texture) and sunk into every pore. Would not recommend at all. * Wanted a stick foundation for a light everyday makeup look. This is perfect! I use about 3 swipes on both sides of my face to even out my complexion. Blends best with a damp sponge followed by a foundation brush. Also love the neutral undertones!! * Love using this have been doing this now for 5 years. Have not been disappointed. * I finally found a stick foundation that matches my skin so well.  I put it directly on my skin after moisturizing and pat it in with a make up sponge.   Using a press shine eliminator my be helpful for oiler skin.  I love this foundation and I will be purchasing it again."

I use it alone (no concealer, highlighter, bronzer, blush) and it works great to cover up my acne scars and even out my complexion. However, I have noticed that it breaks me out really badly. I wish there was a clean formula for this type of product. * Right texture for me * 54 with dry skin. I was concerned about this product bc I normal stick to liquid foundation. I have tried almost every one out there but I was extremely surprised by this foundation! It was easily buildiable with smooth application. I was concerned at 1st the color match was a bit darker (245 warm beige) but after concealer & some pressed powder I had the most beautiful sun-kissed glow! For reference I love Nars in Santa-fe, Clinique  CN 40 cream chamois, Colourpop light 55N. I don't really see any skin type having an issue with this product. It was easy to apply, didn't feel heavy or cakey, never felt oily or dry, just smooth & silky. Highly recommend. No issues using other brand products with this foundation. I saw some saying it moves along or was patchy, follow the directions & build it. This is a cream to powder product so it will apply a bit different.  Will repurchase * LOVE LOVE THIS BLUSH * I was looking for a quick and easy compact makeup and ended up buying this instead of MAC's Full Coverage Foundation since the possible shades that could match me were sold out, and boy am I glad they were! I still haven't gotten to trying the MAC one, but this Milani foundation is incredible and is a lot better than I expected! It's medium to full coverage, looks super natural but flawless on the skin, and is actually less greasy/shiny than most of my liquid foundations which us surprising for a cream. It does set to a satin, powdery finish, and wears beautifully with a touch of powder on top if you have more oily skin like I do. Also, the shades Warm Beige and Sand Beige have really nice neutral-yellow undertones that can match many medium complexions very well! Definitely happy I found my new favorite, easy to apply foundation! This is a lot less messy and quick to apply than liquid foundations, which I love! A brush or a sponge will work equally as great with this stuff and look flawless :) Definitely recommend it! Thanks, Milani!! < 3 * This is very inexpensive and lasts longer than Estee Lauder all day foundation. I didn't have a bald spot on my nose like Estee Lauder at the end of the day. The shineyness at the end of the day was minimal and I have oily T-zone, combo skin. It didn't crease in my fine lines or accentuate my pores. Mac and Estee Lauder powder foundations both did this and were oily right away. I used Laura Mercier primer and Urban Decay setting spray. I use a beauty blender sponge to apply. Milani worked better than more expensive brands. Just try it! Use finishing powder to set before spraying your face. * this is the first powder foundation i have tried and im never going back to liquid foundation."

I love that it has SPF and leaves me with a glowing moisturized finish. * I love trying this halo healthy glow all in one tint moisturizer. It blends so well and gives me a beautiful glow and beautiful look. It goes on smoothly and gives me a nice glow for several hours. I am very pleased with this tinted moisturizer. * The packaging of this product was good. It really didn't have a smell to it, which I think is good. It matched my skin tone pretty well. Overall, I think the coverage and moisturizer in it were great. * Recieved complimentary and  I loved it! I have combo skin and it leaves it looking natural and radiant. Doesn't cling to dry spots nor makes me looks greasy. My tone was chosen for me so it's a tad off but nag to crazy. has natural everyday coverage. Would recommend. * It wasn't my favorite product but it did a decent job on coverage and overall feeling on my skin. * I've always wanted the tinted sunscreen because I don't like how my face gets whiter when I apply those other sunscreens. When I receive this sunscreen, I'm really excited. Finally, I get what I wanted. My face gets smoother and healthier because of the moisturizer elements that have on this sunscreen. Specially, I could use it as a primer too. All in one I needed."

When I first got it out of the package, it was leaking and a liquid consistency. It was dripping all over the place! When applied to my face it wasn't easy to blend because it set in place so fast. My makeup looked so cakey! * This is the first time I have tried this foundation.  It covers well and the color of F10 is great for me at the end of summer.  I tried going down a color as fall got here but it was too light so we will se how long I can wear it. * I am 62 and have a few age spots from tanning on the sides of my face. I apply moisturizer then #9 all over. This product does an excellent job covering flaws. I used a cover stick then foundation for years. This is by far my favorite. I use a lighter color in the winter and a shade darker in the summer. * Great product. Good coverage! * I looked at reviews on internet and they mentioned that it was matte, and its in the lable as well, but if you use sunscreen beneath it like I always do, the foundations becomes luminous. * Love the product. But the downside: The container is glass so its heavy & only half full when purchased. Sometimes you get one with a defective pump...it doesn't come up when using then when it does its squirts product all over making a mess."

So beautiful and doesnt make me break out. Which is crazy, everything makes me breakout but this stiff is the best! * I do not have oily skin but this foundation sure will make you look like you slathered butter on your face. Coverage is not very good either. It's very thin and extremely oily. Usually I do like their other products but this is definitely not it. I have tried it both with primer and without. Neither way lasted all day as it just essentially slid off. * the coverage on this is amazing you can wear on it's own and leaves a beautiful glow but if you have oily skin like me i don't recommend, you'll look a mess lol * I had extremely high hopes for this product. I read all the reviews watched the YouTube videos and was ready to go.  First I tried the shade Punta Cana (5) and it was too dark. Then I went back and got the shady Giza (6) and it was too late, so I decided to mix both of them together, hoping it would balance out. I don't understand how a product can have so much pigment but no coverage if that makes sense.  The product is highly pigmented and when you put it on, you can clearly see there's makeup on your face however, I have a few blemishesthat it provided coverage 0 coverage for.  It didn't matter how much product I went back and dabbed on the blemishes still no coverage. I even let it sit and dry down hoping that would thicken it up but still no coverage.  Also, it was not glowing or dewy for me. I looked straight up Greasy, even with just the first layer, I looked sweaty like I had been out in the sun. It was not a flattering look. I even tried powdering it down, but it just looked greasy with powder on top which basically turned cakey and even with all that I could still see my blemishes through.  I purchased this this evening and I will be returning it immediately when the store opens tomorrow.  I love Juvia's Places' products and I will still continue to support and purchase, but this just didn't work for me.  Buyer beware. * I tried this thanks to a friend who has it and gave me a 'sample' (thank you, girlfriend!).  I must say, yes, it's better than the ones by e.l.f. and Charlotte Tilbury.  You can use it alone for a subtle glow and coverage, or mixed with your foundation (for the same effect).  Looks great either way.  I'm planning on getting a bottle for myself.  I do recommend it. * Elf Halo Glow broke me out and I never was able to try the Flawless Filter by CT but I dont think I need to because I discovered this and I LOVEEEE it. Perfect under foundation or just by itself. Gives me a perfect glow without making me look greasy"

It showed every pore and imperfection. Including any dry skin and did not cover well at all. I wanted to really like it but it didn't work for me * I love this foundation, its like your own skin but better. * At this price I'm pretty disappointed. Color match was great and does not oxidize, but that's where the pros ended for me. Definitely not full coverage, didn't blend well and shifts/splotchy. If you're an oilslick like me… this is a total waste. Maybe good for dryer skin? Going back to Dior at this price point and won't be purchasing this one again. * This foundation brought out texture and wrinkles I have never seen before. It is not very blend-able, as it takes a lot of manipulation to look somewhat acceptable. This product is very drying and I have oily skin. Not to mention it does not adhere to the skin, it slips and sides off your face throughout the day leaving you patchy. * I finally found my holy grail foundation, I didn't even buy it at Ulta but that's how much I loved it to write a review. It feels like I'm wearing nothing, it matches my skin perfectly which has been a nightmare for years trying to find a good match. * This coverage is a lot more sheer and dewy than I had anticipated. This would be a beautiful foundation for someone with dry, mature skin since it does not crease. The colors are not accurate either. I suggest ordering one to two shades darker. * I need to keep looking. I have a full bottle that I hope to find someone that it works for."

Also primer/no primer the product goes on well. * Very very easy for applying on skin  love this product * overall, this product is pretty terrible for me at least. very greasy & oily, transfers easily, little to no coverage on my acne & stuck to dry patches. did no justice for me whatsoever. * I use it on my whole face starting around my eyes nose an spread it my cheeks and chin.before I use blush. * I had to mix it with another foundation to color match it but it looks cakey and not full coverage * I bought this for my mom hoping it would give her enough coverage but it's almost sheer in spots. * But I don't.

It feels so nourishing and applies so evenly. It's light yet gives a good medium coverage. A great summertime weight. Not heavy but yet just enough color. Love it. Buy it. Give it a try. I think you'll like it. * This foundation is so perfect for me. It blends perfectly into my skin. It's so easy to apply. I just dab it on with a beauty sponge and I'm done in minutes! 
I love it ❤️ * I'm not sure why my skin reacts to foundation so terribly, but even the luxury brands make me look a little off. I know my undertone and have been able to pinpoint my exact color profile, so it's not that. Foundation usually sits on top of my face, amplifies my fine lines, and makes me look like a hot mess. Age Perfect Tinted Balm is the only foundation that makes me look better, and I wish I knew about it sooner. It's my favorite! * I have what the skincare industry refers to as ""mature ""skin. I am a make junkie and I had many foundations from drugstores and major department stores but as I got older they all made me look cake and settled into lines. I stumbled on this product and I love it. It's my skin only better. It lasts almost all day on my  combination oily dry skin. It is a wonderful product with light medium coverage for mature skin. Will definitely buy again * I've used 3 pots of this now and I'm still somehow surprised by how nice it is. The formula feels like it won't cover much, but it softens the appearance of/seems to fill and even out pores, scars, wrinkles, or any textures--I often get compliments on how smooth my skin looks when I use this. I've gone back and forth between two colors because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the color match is a little difficult. All in all, I keep trying new foundations just to come back to this one and be impressed by it. * I'm a light-medium skin tone that leans towards cool. I got started on this because an influencer raved about it a few yrs. ago. I decided to try it and couldn't had been more thrilled. I use shade fair 20 for reference. In the pot it looks more like a peach shade. It glides on effortlessly and melts into my skin. My dry/mature skin looks healthy. I'm sure I will get tired of this foundation, but for the last 3 yrs. I've been pleased. Only time will tell. * I was very skeptical to try this and was shocked. It is so good. 47 year old combo skin, apply with real techniques dense brush and its better than high end. How is this not more popular?"

I actually found it quite drying. I love HG products and am so glad Ulta is carrying them. I hope they'll carry the newer HG skin tint so I can try that one. * Im 55 and my skin is very dry, this product is moisturizing and never settles in my pores , an excellent alternative to foundation which just sat on my skin, this tinted moisturizer does not do that. I would highly recommend this product- * I have never had so many compliments about my skin since using this tinted moisturizer! It may not be for anyone needing full coverage makeup but someone looking for a glow and slight coverage! * It was very hard to find something for my aging skin that is full coverage, but doesn't settle into lines and look caked on. this was recommended in store and I absolutely love it! I apply with a beauty blender and use shape tape concealer with a tiny bit of setting powder. Really makes a difference being hyaluronic and any pictures while wearing come out great. A must in my drawer. * I wanted to like this. I have dry skin and some creepiness at 52. This made all of that worse.

It's very thick and kinda hard to blend out even with moisturizer and primer. 
I had to return this and buy the Too Faced brand hydrating liquid foundation. * Several comments said this was medium to full coverage which made me want to try it and it is not. There is absolutely no coverage at all. If anything it's just a glorified moisturizer so I'm thinking those other comments were for a different product. * Absolutely one of my favorite foundation.

Also great for touch-ups when mineral foundation SPF is needed out in the sun! The closing latch wasn't super secure but I never had a problem with it opening in my purse. The new design is thick and super heavy. It's beautiful to sit on a counter, but useless weight for travel or carried in a shoulder bag. So sad I never odered backs up of the slim gold-tone compact! * I was surprised how expensive this compact is. But I have had so many contacts break and then I get crumbled pressed powder. This one looks like it will hold up well. I will let you know the first time I drop it-Yikes! * Very happy with this new compact. My JI mineral foundation stores securely,  the compact opens easily and now has a mirror. Yay! * I am a loyal Jane Iredale brand user. In fact, I have been using their products for over 20 years. The Jane Iredale line was recommended to me by the surgeon who did facial reconstruction after skin cancer surgery. 

Although I love their products, I have always been ""ehh"" about their packaging....until now! Thanks for finally giving up the gaudy gold (sorry, Jane Iredale) and going with this new, modern and aesthetically pleasing line of packaging. Since I have several of the old gold compacts, including the gold metals ones, I ordered one of the new compacts to see how I would like it. After receiving the new compact, I cannot wait to replace ALL my older versions! 

One more suggestion... in your future development, please consider making your eye shadows available in refills. I love the idea of being kinder to our planet and saving on the excess packaging. I do not mind paying separately for the cases if I know if is making a smaller, greener impact for future generations. =)

One final note of thanks to Ulta...I have been begging my local store to start carrying Jane Iredale. I am glad to see that you are at least finally carrying this amazing, clean line of makeup online! * I bought this on sale and I'm glad I did. It just makes it nice to put your foundation in. For the price of the foundation, it's a shame you have to purchase compact separately. * This packaging is overpriced and by default should be included with the powder. Waste of money."

The issue is the pump… it does not pull product well after tube is no longer full and it doesn't come off. So its just wasted product. * Of course it doesn't fully cover blemishes, its not full coverage. I buy this again & again & pair it with concealer for under eyes / blemishes , & blush. Its so smooth, never breaks out my acne prone skin. I love it so much!! * Honestly I hate foundation, I have super sensitive skin and anything can break me out easily. This foundation is SO NICE!! It is more like a skin tint than a foundation, which I prefer if I do ever wear it, the smell is relaxing (if you're not an essential oil person I wouldn't recommend, the lavender is pretty strong), and it doesn't feel like anything is on. For my Florida girls this stuff is a great quick fix for the hot and humid days!! * I have super sensitive, rosacea-prone skin & my eyes are really easily irritated by makeup (ocular rosace) that started a few years ago - suddenly I couldn't wear my favorite makeup without breaking out, & my eyes burning, bright red. I searched & finally found a brand specifically for rosacea-prone skin! So happy to be able to wear makeup again! Over the last year or so the formula clearly changed - I couldn't find a color match & then my eyes started to  burn again. Back to the search - finally found this - I love this foundation & the whole product line! It's light & looks great - as others have said, I look like myself, only better! It doesn't settle in my lines or pores, doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It does feel a bit oily / has a bit of shine. Also, Nude 3 is a perfect color match for me when it goes on, but it does darken a bit across the day so I'm going to try 2.5 & save 3 for the summer. Otherwise, highly recommend!! * I bought this foundation and love it.  I'm 47 years old with dry and pigmented skin from aging and I like light coverage products due to aging skin look more natural than full coverage foundation.  Very moisturizing.  I still set with loose powder and yes would buy this as long as nudestix still made this. * I got this product in shades light3 it a good tinted moisturizer with light to medium at most.  Great for dry skin.  Love this product. * Flawless and lightweight. I'm in love."

I love it for the days I want more coverage. If you don't shake it really good you will find its a runny consistency. I felt the need to review the foundation after reading some of the reviews. * I've been doing makeup for over an decade and I've never found a foundation that doesn't make me look cakey. I've tried every popular brand in the world (under $50) and just couldnt find a product my skin liked until this one. 

I have both very oily and very dry skin and zero skin care routine so a lot of that is likely due to me being a bit terrible. But I was randomly recommended this over a year ago by a guy at the mall of America morphe store and it genuinely felt like second skin. He paired it with morphe primer and it's the best my skin ever has or will look. It looks so natural and yet makes my skin look amazing. You can't even tell I'm wearing foundation. 

I sadly ran out and tossed the bottle before ordering more like an idiot and I've spent the last 5 months trying to track this foundation down. I just ordered more so unless the formula has changed drastically I'll add pictures once I have it. But I was genuinely mourning the loss of this foundation and thought I was doomed to have cakey looking skin again forever. 

If you can't find a foundation no matter how many you try I highly highly recommend this one. Maybe my skin is just weird so it might not work for you but I will never ever allow myself to run out of this foundation again. It's been a terrible few months for my makeup without it. * I really love this foundation. I used to use MAC and like this much better after trying a bunch of different brands. I have very sensitive skin and no problems. I have been using this for years now and I am very happy with it. It goes on smooth and it buildable to a good medium coverage. * This was my first time trying this make up brand and I a now a fan! Makeup is lightweight and comfortable to the skin. Is  100% true to skin match and buildable coverage, and also holds well in heat! * Run run RUN to get this foundation!!! I cant say enough good things about it! It gives such a radiant, skin like finish and doesnt feel heavy or greasy. Plus, the shades come in differnt formulas, depending on the shade range!!!"

I use a light shade which I chose by pretty much matching my neck/highlight areas and use it mainly in my T zone. highlighting under eyes, forehead between brows chin and then I also add it along my jawline. then I go about my routine as normal but without the need for foundation highlight and baking. saves so much time! it builds well and has amazing coverage. it lasts all day. I have mature skin and hate when things settle into fine lines and wrinkles and I do not have that problem with this. it actually makes my skin appear younger compared to my full face routine with baking etc. I know I hav to find a new foundation to help avoid it but who has the time lol anyway... YES. this product is one I want to hoard in case it ever goes away. it's amazing. I use it with a compact dense brush. 

only downside is that I broke 2... but it's because I throw it in my purse and I know that's not ideal and on me for being careless. but if it's getting tossed around, be aware the powder may break. * This is a must have in my kit! I use it to lightly set my foundation and it transforms my face! I have also used it as a powder foundation for summer days and it is flawless! * This is the best powder foundation i have ever tried, i reach for this one over my high end one. Its my go to during the summer months. * Medium to full coverage. I like to carry it in my bag for touch ups because it covers the redness around the nose, i can cover up some my blemishes that peak out after wearing makeup all day etc * I use the shade Natural and I absolutely love this powder. i've used mine all the way to the pan and just restocked a new one. Literally the most beautiful blurring coverage, doesn't feel cakey or drying and my skin looks flawless. Great for on the go and quick touch ups. I usually hate the feeling of wearing heavy foundations and powders so once I found this it was over. Super breathable and comfortable and evens out my skin tone in a couple quick pass overs. I love this product. * Medium to high coverage, smoothing, non-comedogenic. Its a bit hard to shade match. I use Soft Tan in this powder and Nars Valencia, Lisa Eldridge 19, Estee Lauder 4w1. * This was my favorite foundation for everyday wear until recently. It is the best color match I've found and so easy to use. However, as others have stated, my last two orders have fallen apart into unusable powder within a few uses. Super bummed."

It seems a lot of brands are now incorporating good skincare ingredients in foundations and this one is a winner! 🥇🙌🏻👏🏻 * Went tried on my arm but ,when I put on face was way to dark for it.
But this is my first time ever using anything on my face so I'm  learning baby steps. * I'm over 50, have fair, neutral, combination skin with especially dry cheeks, redness, and texture. This foundation seemed to cover the redness fine but it faded within about 2 hours of wear. It settled in my fine lines and looked, for lack of a better word, gritty. No fragrance but does have an unpleasant chemical smell. It's a no for me. (Not Revlon's fault but the color-finding function led me to 117 Light Beige, which was the right depth level but pulled warm on me.) * the most skinlike finish of any drugstore product I've ever found. it has good coverage, wears comfortably on the skin, and doesn't crease or transfer if you set and prep correctly. it feels like the $50-$70 foundations i used to wear and the price is unbeatable. 10/10 * What an incredible skin loving foundation. After 2 weeks of using I'm noticing a more even skin tone, my fine lines are disappearing, and my skin feels nourished. I love this for spring/ summer! I prefer it without primer as I notice I get the most benefit that way. I do set with a non-talc powder and Milani setting spray. It truly looks like skin if you get the right shade! * When set properly, this foundation lasts all day, looks like skin, and never cakes or clings to dry patches. It looks and feels expensive on the skin, and I'd pick this over my Lancome for coverage anyway. It can be a bit too dewy if you don't do proper skin prep, but with the right primer and setting powder, it's perfect 👌 * This is an AMAZING foundation. The coverage is perfection. It's dewy, has great ingredients, and I absolutely love it on my very sensitive skin. I have been using this since it was introduced to the Revlon line and my hope is that this will never discontinue. 🤞 I have used only high-end foundations in the past before trying this foundation and this one is a clear winner. 🙌🏻🩷😻"

Its patchy and gross feeling. * I tried to mkx this with so mant thingd and use it so many ways and it sucks. Its patchy and gross feeling. * I wore this last night and actually liked how it applied (first time I tried it, it did pill) and wore. Woke up this morning with a forehead full of bumps :( I know there are benefits for some, but the niacinamide really messed with my skin * This would be my holy grail foundation IF it wasn't so frustrating to apply. I have extremely dry skin and this tint gives just enough coverage to make my skin look radiant and healthy. It does not transfer, does not stick to or accentuate dry spots, and the shade range goes light enough for me, which usually isn't the case for tints with limited shades. HOWEVER, this stuff is an absolute nightmare to apply. If you accidentally touch it with your brush or sponge after it dries down (which takes only a few seconds), it will pill and come off your face. The only way I've found to fix this is to remove it and start over. Maybe I'm applying it wrong, but I've tried different primers, applicators, etc., all with the same result. I really wish it wasn't so hard to apply because I love the finish, but I won't be repurchasing because of this. * I have sensitive, oily, and redness-prone skin, so moisturizers usually dont work on me. Im plesently suprised on how well this works with my skin chemistry. The coverage is very much buildable, some days i put just a tiny bit on to moisturize and even out my skin-tone, othertimes i build it up for more coverage. Only downside is the occasional pilling that others here mentioned, but its subtle enough. * I love this.  I apply after i ise a moisturizer.  Provides supermligbt coverage to even out skin tone. I use the shade 15 which has a yellow indertone rather than red. * It has great ingredients but it jusy peels right off the face. It doesnt stick at all it immediatly pills its unwearable which sucks cuz i love the ingredients"

Evens my skin tone and mixes well with my sunscreen * I'm usually a prestige foundation only girly but this worked great for me. Its great for a light foundation or light coverage days. It helped even out my skin tone. It is nice but it will get into wrinkles like the one I have in the middle of my brow. However, I just pat it down and call it a day. Nice product for the price range. * This serum tint has a nice smooth consistency, covers well, and goes on easily. Good color choices for most skin tones. I have combination skin, more dry than oily, and the serum in this tint is just right. For the price point, it's worth a try. * I bought this on a whim, and it exceeded my expectations.  It goes on so smoothly, the coverage is that of a foundation, but it's still light enough to feel like a tinted moisturizer.  Would definitely purchase this again * I've tried many foundations and serum tints from  drugstore to high end. I love this Serum Tint!!! Medium coverage with a soft glow effect to your complexion. Easy to apply with a good foundation brush or finger tips. I do use a primer but not really necessary. Big bang for your bucks.  Good skin benefits too. * I've been looking for a drug store dupe for my ilia serum skin tint and sadly this is not it. It was patchy on my dry skin and also made me look so washed out. I got this because with the serum title I thought it would help my skin look dewy etc. * I bought this in the shade light natural and it is true (as the other reviews state) that the serum will be a lot lighter than the packaging color when applied to the face. It wasn't too far from my skincolor so it wasn't much of a problem for me. I would rebuy a darker shade next time. I loved this product much more than I expected tbh. I'm not a big fan of heavy makeup/skincare and this felt lightweight enough for me to us it as my foundation. It feels nice throughout the day but will get patchy as well."

I work in a cooler all day so trust this helps my skin! * I will say that I have used this product in the past. Its not too bad for the price of the product. However, the coverage is very light and not really buildable. Although, I do like how it gives a somewhat dewy effect. I also like how it has clean ingredients! So if you like dewy foundation, light coverage, and clean ingredients then this product might be for you. * I rarely wear foundation, largely because I hate how heavy it feels on my face, and I also love my freckles and foundations tend to cover them. I bought this out of curiosity and I'm surprisingly happy with the result! It's a pretty watery consistency, but that means A) a little goes a long way, especially when applied with a foundation brush, and B) it feels so light on my face!! It evened out my skin tone (as someone with vitiligo, this is always a big win!!) without totally covering my freckles. It looks super natural, too. I appreciate the price for the amount of product and the fact that it has no scent. 

The one con for me is that my nose felt kind of greasy a few hours later—but the rest of my face felt pretty dry, so that could just be my overactive pores LOL.

For reference, I am very pale (and I have vitiligo). I'm using shade 520- Fair. * It smelt soooo bad bro, i put it on twice, once to try and another to actually go out and then when i did it to go out it started peeling and looked SOOOOO cakey, like cakier than cakey. It smells TERRIBLE, when i was applying it i had to hurry since it smelt sooo bad, i can even explain fbe scent, but its just plain terrible, dont recommend * As I enter my mid-twenties, I've transitioned from the thick, full-coverage foundations of my adolescence to more lightweight and natural finishes. I bought this with the hopes of it being a bit more full coverage than a regular tinted moisturizer.

The color match is great, no quarrels there. It is also a great base for makeup and blends very smoothly with a beauty blender. I am, however, disappointed in the coverage. It is a very sheer foundation - it mostly just does color correction and levels out skin color. It does not do much for acne scars or dark circles. Also make sure to exfoliate and moisturize, as this will cling to dry patches. It also seems to fade a bit throughout the day.

Overall, it's a decent tinted moisturizer. Look elsewhere for lightweight with coverage. * Both my teens use this and love it. Provides a good light coverage without to much of a makeup look. * The sheerest tinted moisturizer i have. On good rosacea days i can wear this over light concealer. It feels lightweight because it is super runny."

It also looks a bit cakey but i highly recomend spraying do we setting spray onto your brush/sponge, and then blending out. * I normally wear Estee stay matte foundation but I was out and until it arrived I needed something in the meantime. I wore this out, was standing in the parking lot talking to my friends and some random lady walked up to us and said ""sorry to interupt but I just have to tell you, you are stunning"" ( she was talking to me) And then she walked off. I was never told that when I wore the Estee! What the heck, this stuff is GOLD. * I have been using this foundation for 5 years now. I will say it is not full coverage but it is buildable. This foundation feels so lightweight & it gives such a natural look. I've tried other foundations but always come back to this one cause its just so good! I tend to have an oily T-zone & everywhere else is pretty much dry but this foundation doesn't ever really cake or flake on me. I 100% recommend this foundation for an everyday natural look! * I love this foundation! it's affordable and stays on all throughout the work day * this foundation is surprisingly good for the price. it's buildable, smooth, and has a nice matte but natural finish. it flaked on my chin area after a few hours, but that could be my skin type. * Love this for my combo skin. I'm not extremely oily but I needed something that would actually last throughout the day without needing to powder by midday. I actually like it better than the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I am shade 090 in Lancome but have not been able to find a good color match as 090 is too light and the next shades are too dark and orange. I have very fair neutral skin. I prefer how the covergirl looks, it is very smooth with slightly better coverage, and L20 is a great shade and a closer match than the Lancome (maybe L20 is a dash too light but it looks perfect after bronzer). It gives a natural matte finish that doesn't cling or look cakey. Works well on my middle-age skin with fine lines. Has great medium-full coverage. Highly recommend! * I really love this foundation and I will continue to purchase it! Affordable and covers well."

Do not recommend. * Awesome and affordable! Very waterproof and looks great, liquid to powder type foundation. I enjoy that and it's full coverage when built up, not cake. Shade light medium is a perfect match! I'm sticking up, it's worth it! * this foundation was great. it was a little on the cheap side so i knew it wasn't going to be amazing, but it gets the job done.

Elf kills it with all the products they release but this is top tier. * I really wanted to like this product, but even though I moisturize my skin, it leaves randow streaks on my face, as if i applied it with a paint brush. And leaves weird marks on my nose that I cant blend out and have to literally use my nails to scratch off. I have oily skin and never experienced this with a powder foundation. * I have fair skin and got the recommended color. It's too yellow for me and honestly isn't as good as the dermablend camo. I only got it because I can't find the dermablend camo anywhere. This doesn't stay on my skin very well and rubs off so easily. * I am 39 years old, and I have struggled to find a powder foundation that would work for my combo skin, I have spent tons of money, looked high and low, and have never been happy with anything that I found in the past. I could not believe how well, this held up for me! I am 39 years old and I had a baby nine months ago and don't have much time to do my make up but I still wanna look half decent when I have to go out of the house and this is quick and easy and effortless, I highly recommend this to anybody who cannot seem to find a powder foundation that works for them, maybe you might meet your match with this one. I do use the little sponge that comes with the powder because it works for me and I don't want to try to mess withthe system lol. * If your ever going for a simple quick look thsi is the foundation powder to use, the shade match is incredible accurate,decent coverage for a sinple quick look.

I thought it would be similar to MUFE Matte Velvet Skin because of the name, but it's more comparable to Huda Beauty Faux Filter foundation IMO. Very thick and not the easiest to blend, especially down your neck or in the creases of your nose. It starts drying basically the moment you put it on your face, which doesn't help with blending. Bought shade Fair Cool and it goes on practically white, but does dry down darker.

An okay foundation for the price you pay, but there are better ones out there. * This foundation is incredibly thick, making it hard to blend. My face looks overly dry, even with moisturizer and primer. * I have very oily acne prone skin and i live in humid florida, and travel often. If you need to cover blemishes and acne this is your stuff, a veey little goes a longggg way, full coverge not too heavy and it doesn't cake up, you need to use a moisturizer under as it can be drying, which is perfect if you have oily skin like me. I stopped buying high end dermablend and this is a very affordable replacement * Doesn't blend nice into my skin. Looks chalky and uneven * thick heavy and weird orangey color * This is my favorite Ulta foundation!! It gives a complete coverage with only a minimum amount required. * I bought this because it was on sale. It was on sale for a reason. Disappointed as I need my foundation to be both full coverage and matte, but this dries extremely quickly and I'm an oily face girl and even this was so beyond dry. I got the light shade and it completely ghosted me out. Hot mess foundation."

And it was on sale 😁 felt good on my face. I used it and yes it was worth it the staying power  was good specially of your from az. * Have a hard time matching foundation to my skin tone and this matches me perfectly. It looks natural and has buildable coverage. For the price, you cannot beat it, I own foundations double the price and this is now my go to. Give it a shot. :D * I bought this like a month ago and I love it! You dont have to use a lot and literally your face is flawless. One of the things i love about this product is it doesnt dry out your skin. I got the shade neutral 25 and id say that its a mix of fair and tan. I also really love the application part of it, the wand is really nice!!! * Covers a lot without having to apply a ton. Love the application wand * I love this foundation I find myself reaching for it more  often than the others. it's not drying, not greasy,  the coverage looks like my skin but glowy, and not cakey. The kiko Milano powder is awesome too for baking BTW. This foundation is way very similar to TF Born this way foundation, (but not as greasy) kiko milano is underrated IMO. Yes I would recommend."

Blended like a dream, gorgeous satin finish, blurred imperfections, clean and fragrance free.  The color 1C was actually a cool tone, this new 1C is PEACH toned....very warm, and the formula change truly makes me sad....it's not the same. They ruined a perfect product. * I absolutely love this product! The smell is a bit strong and the application is a little off-putting, but it blends great and looks great! I found that instead of using a traditional primer like elf power grip, using a setting spray to prime made application easier and blending smoother. * My skin looked worse with this. Highlighying pores no matter how much or how many different methods i use. And shows every bump, dry patch, etc. its so weird. Like the opposite of why we wear makeup in the first place. So mad i was fooled that im writing a review * I have very fair and pink skin and have always had trouble finding foundations that match my tone, never mind work well on my oily/combination skin, but I will say that this one does a good job! I was nervous buying online without match testing, but I got the 1C and would say its a pretty good match for my skin tone. 

My pros for this are definitely: generaly matches my skin, works well with my oily/combination skin, it coming in a stick format is very convenient and mess free, stays on very well, looks natural, and doesnt make my skin feel gross

My cons would be: not the perfect match (wish the undertones were more p and that the shade was slightly lighter), can get a little cakey if i put too much on, and a little hard to blend. 

For context I've been wearing Too Faced Born this way foundation in the shade Snow for years now because it's the only foundation I've found that comes close to matching my skin, but I've always run into the same problem of not being able to apply the foundation too thick because then you can tell it's not a true match. Anyway, I would say overall thi one does a better job, has better ingredients, feels better on my skin, and is a good price point.

My last points would be dont let the 1 star reviews scare you, this foundation is very nice and as long as you use a wet sponge to apply and don't mind the mild scent of castor oil that fades in about 30 minutes :) * The old formula was amazing.  Shade 1C was a perfect cool tone as described.  This newer version is very peach in tone and no longer qualifies as cool toned.  So  if you are a fair, cool toned person...look elsewhere. * I have come back to this product again and again after trying other hydrating foundations that are too thin and messy or settle into pores. This is my favorite non-SPF foundation. It is like a natural version of cover girl compact makeup. It's vegetable oil based so it does smell like olive oil. But it's so nourishing and convenient with the solid stick. It smooths on well to a medium coverage and natural dewy finish that doesn't settle into my pores or cause breakouts for me. And with a light powder to set, it stays all day. I do wish they had lighter shades as the lightest warm (2W) is a bit dark for me in winter. But I'm a repeat customer of this good clean dry skin foundation option. * This brand is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I live in the desert and ingredients like hyaluronic acid just pull the water out of your skin because there's no water in the air here. It seemed like every make up and skincare brand hopped on that train and I couldn't find anything for my skin (dry) and climate type. I hope they never change the formula! I'm almost 30 and I'm starting to get crows ft etc and this really does a great job of camouflage without settling in any wrinkles."

It does have a incredibly potent smell that lingers long after it dries, but I have been able to get used to it and I only notice when during application. * Although I like this foundation in everyway I have to give a low score because it isn't CRUELTY FREE.   There is no good reason for testing on animals and there are plenty of good products available which ARE CRUELTY FREE too. * I purchased this on a whim as i saw it on sale. I received it at the same time another package with the new Prada foundation came in, and I'm shocked that i like the Lorac foundation more than the Prada!  I applied this with my Hourglass foundation brush as the formula is quite thin amd it went on beautifully. Its so smooth and the finish really is a soft matte. It seems to be very long lasting as well. My first favorite foundation of the year. * I finally got my hands on this foundation and I wore it and loved it right away! I will say if you're sensitive to smells it does smell like paint but it will fade. This foundations lasts all day and blurred my acne scared skin & pores. obsessed! * Lorac left no choice but to select this when they quit making the PoreFection foundation.  This has no sunscreen and it has an odor similar to molasses. I use it because it doesn't break my face out. * I love it one of the reasons I love it is because it doesn't crease and settle in my  lines and it's very very hard to find products they don't do that. I can't get over the coverage when I first tried it I was so skeptical, because it is runny and well, it just didn't seem like it was gonna be that great…! And it is in my opinion…  To apply it I use a beauty blender and it goes on amazing and for me honestly a little bit goes a long way. … I have large pores texturize skin, but yet this one seems to work good for me and not feel too heavy.… I wouldn't say it's totally water resistant, but good enough because let me tell you I've cried while having it on and it does not streak not at all at least not for me and like I said,  I'm almost 46 years old. I'm a 45 year old woman so it's been a struggle for me and I know other people have been saying a lot of different things then I am saying, but I know for me personally it is one of my favorites and always will be! And I highly recommend for more mature skin… I really really do … I have used a brush with it before and it does work good as well. Not a matte either. Just a beautiful natural finish not too dewy. Put it to you this way whenever I use the Lorac foundation, I always get compliments oh, and before I forget, it does not crease on my eyelids, and that is one of my biggest pet peeves ever 😂. * Since the perfection foundation was discontinued I thought this pro version would somehow be better. It is not. It is very heavy coverage and cakes on. It truely smells like maple syrup. Laura Mercier makes a tinted moisturizer w SPF that is more like porefection formerly by Lorac."

I don't think this is one of them.  It's the old school sort--the kind that feels very waxy.  If you have dry skin, you will not be pleased.  It's very hard to get the finish to look good, and even harder to get it to stay looking good.  It's probably not going to save you time or make your life easier on the go. * I am blown away by how amazing this stick foundation is!! It gives a barely there feeling which i love. It does not settle into fine lines and stays on all day. Can't wait to try more stuff from the brand!!! * This stick goes on sooo smoothly! Absolutely love the consistency of this makeup! My skin looked like a barely there makeup look, exactly what i was going for. Definitely need to extend the shade range of this makeup but other than that this stuff is amazing!! * great coverage for my skin tone and felt smooth.  please add more skin tones so all people can have it. * this shade range has every type of tone for lighter skin but for 1 dark complexion do better * I honestly dont unserstand why people who've never tried this give it a low rating due to the shade range. This is an Italian owned brand. Majority of the population is olive, light to medium skintones. Many of them/us have a hard time finding our shades. Go try Fenty Beauty if you dont like it. Anyways, this is fantastic. Super blendable and looks smooth on my texture. * the shade range is disgusting. its not like italy is a sheltered country or anything, many POC reside there. darker women, men, and all in between deserve to have products that fit their skin too. do better."

So skin ends up looking splotchy. Wipes off easily and blends with nothing. Won't purchase again! * I have combination skin, super oily with dry patches. I hate the feeling of foundation so I just prefer something super light to even out my color and mattify me. This stuff is perfect! It feels completely weightless and looks natural. It wears off gradually by the end of the day without looking crazy. Definitely my favorite face makeup! * It wiped off easily didn't  stay on my face. I would use it in a certain spot and i would try and apply it somewhere else and it would wipe off * As for color match, it's perfect. But it doesn't really cover up my imperfections like age spots * Looks great on my skin. * Very light coverage. Feels so light and soft on skin. Not oily after a full day of wear! Doesn't cover blemishes the best but will give a nice even tone over the skin. Blends nicely! * I loved this! Its very light weight. I used under this my normal skin car rountine. And i wear elf glow sunscreen and halo glow with this bb cream and i loved the result. I do use conceler as well. And i dont feel caked on. Honestly try this method."

It does not layer itself well (looks very textured), however. No other complaints, as long as you like light coverage glow with a single layer of product I'd say you have found the best product in the market in this price range! Also stays preserved well, in case you're soemone that takes a while to go through product. * I LOVED the Light Illusion foundation! Then I tried this. WHAT a letdown. It is runny, thin, has NO coverage. THE COLOR( I wear L2  IVORY in Light Illusion) is also DARKER than LIGHT ILLUSION. The L2 Ivory is the same as the L4 warm beige. * I bought this on a whim on sale because ive heard good things and actually really like other flower products BUT this is was a let down I understand its a ""serum"" fondation and not meant to provide coverage thats fine what I DIDNT LIKE was the fact that i could not get this to stick to my skin it transferred and moved around and good luck trying to apply anything on top of it * I love serum foundations and this one did not disappoint! This one is up there with the more high end serum foundations in every way but without the crazy price tag. It is sheer - exactly what I like! - and blends like a dream. It has staying power and flattering shades. A little goes a long way. It plays well with other products both cream and powder. No moisturizer needed as it is very hydrating - my dry mature skin drinks this up and loves it! Very happy! * I've got combination skin with an oily t-zone and dry on my forehead and underneath my eyes, this doesn't bring any of this texture out! It's light coverage which I like for daily wear and for hot days. * It's so light! Def what I was looking for. Just a psa to anyone who wants to buy this, I'd suggest buying at AT THE store because I ordered it and received it with the product spilled. Still product in the bottle, but I for some reason can't put it sideways or it leaks. So if you order it online, be aware either the bottle is just awful or it broke while it was shipping to me. 
Other than that it's a wonderful product * I have used way too many foundations from luxury to drug store and this is by far the one I always want to reach for and have a back up. I have to force myself to use other foundations. I have normal to dry skin with some hyperpigmentation and prefer light coverage foundations that looks like skin. I use a smoothing primer in my pore areas, do two pumps with a drop of oil, dab it onto my skin and blend with a brush and this always makes my skin look absolutely flawless. No caking around my nose or forehead areas. Throughout the day, it continues to melt into my skin and look better and better. I can imagine this wouldnt be ideal with those with oily skin or who want more coverage, but for me this is the gold standard and what I put all of my other foundations/skin tints against."

It is so thick it won't pump out. The foundation is clumpy and doesn't spread at all. Why did they change a good product???? * This foundation is worth trying! Creamy, spreads nicely (I use a brush), nice colour matching (I consider myself a medium brown skin colour). Overall great product! * I cannot say enough GOOD THINGS about this CC cream. There comes the point when foundation is out, and CC cream is in, and I am pleased with this product's color choices, smooth texture, and luminescence. I mix two shades and apply the first color as a primer. This CC cream doubles as my concealer; it's that easy to apply. * This product: separates BADLY and doe not blend well at all; Smells weird and chemical-y; offers VERY little coverage, even for a CC cream, and is overpriced because of all these factors. Positives: it makes skin glowy and has SPF. I wouldn't buy this personally - Pacifica's skincare and fragrance are AMAZING, but makeup seems to be a weak point. * This product came out separated. Tried shaking product to get product mixed together and it came out somewhat like foundation. Does not go on skin nicely. Do not recommend. * it comes out as a clear oil with little specs of color that don't blend."

Please please PLEASE bring back some of the lighter colors. * I bought this over the holidays and LOVED it!! Goes on easily and is weightless. Soooo disappointed to see that my shade is not available. Please do not discontinue this product. * My perfect shade is Light to Medium Cool.  Not available the last 2 times I've tried to buy.

I show this to the older women in my family and you would think I was literally doing a magic trick lol shock awe and wonder. I often and loudly recommend this in True Caramel. Perfect for lace on wigs or just on skin * The foundation is very smooth and moisturizing.  It provides medium coverage, so I build it by applying several applications to get a more full coverage.  It is a great product for the price. * I have purchased this product before and I liked it. This time the product was used. It had a finger smudge print on it when l opened it and the sponge applicator had make all on one side. I ended up purchasing something else at another store. * First, note this has the ingredients that Danessa Myricks uses for her foundation at an affordable cost. This provides a great shade match, makes skin look healthy and even, easy to take with you and stays on even if you sweat. The magnesium carbonate in the formula absolutely is wonderful for sweaty moments. I just find you can't really apply it with anything other than a sponge. Brushes with dense round tops don't pick it up well, as nothing else does. If you don't want to buy a beauty sponge you'll be fine to use the one it comes with. * Great shade for Hispanic women. * Too dark/matched my hand-too dark for my face * My mom loves this foundation and looks forward to trying more products from the line"

The powder did not blend well under my eyes at all, and instead turned cakey immediately. I tried putting it on other areas like my forhead and cheeks and it was the same issue. I had to go back and get another powder the next day because I couldn't handle it. Also, for some reason, it irritated my skin. I would not recommend this product. * This powder is not only affordable but it sits on my skin very nicely. I use it all over my face including my eyes. Pairs well with First Aid Beauty eye cream. * For the price this brand is solid. Would definitely recommend! * I loved this powder. Specially to set up the concealer… is great. My skin is combo. This product highlight my under eyes area and no creases , stay long,  and look beautiful. * If you have rough texture or lines it will show. But if your skin is pretty smooth it works great, only issue I ran into was dry skin patches but was an easy fix with a moisturizer underneath. I would definitely buy again. I usually use IT cosmetics foundation powder, but actually prefer this one for the price. * It wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't agree with my skin or skincare. It did end up looking cakey/separated after about 2 hours. * Got this on a whim since it was affordable. I needed a pressed powder to add to my collection since my favorite loose powder is from wet n wild (the banana brightening one). But this looks fine on around the face but TERRIBLE under the eyes. I dont want to return so i will use it around the face and avoid the undereyes."

Isnt all foundation tinted""? Maybe try tinted moisturizer * Light and hydrating product that evens out dull skin without looking heavy! Great for looking put together on minimal makeup days. * The coverage of this bad boy is wat too light to be called a foundation, but it doesnt have any skin care benefits which is I guess why they can't call it BB cream. It's refreshing to have a product with light coverage and a natural finish instead of dewy. Great for no makeup makeup days. * I found the Tawny shade of L.A. Girl Tinted Foundation in my local Ulta's clearance section and figured I'd give it a try. When I got home, I used Ulta's shade matcher and it told me I was really Warm Sand in this product (based off entering Ginger for bareMineral's COMPLEXION RESCUE Tinted Moisturizer Mineral SPF 30). Warm Sand perfectly matches my skin right now during the winter. I'll try Tawny again in the spring/summer, but it was a close match too. I love how lightweight this product feels and how easy it is to apply — I dot it on right from the tube and the dab/blend with a lightly moist makeup sponge. It looks just slightly dewy but doesn't feel overly wet or sticky. It also works well under my bareMinerals BAREPRO 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation if I want to look more made up, but between the price and its natural look when used solo, it fits well with my minimalist approach to makeup. * I am 66 years old. It settled into my wrinkles and emphasized them.  Very sheer coverage. Not a good choice for me. * This is amazingggg!! it's creamy and dries so you don't need any powder, the finish is a natural satin finish and i have dry skin NC42 and the tan is perfection! * I love this foundation its a good one if you're looking for an affordable foundation thats light to medium coverage.

It did absolutely nothing other than make me have a Casper look. It is so sheer I can't imagine it doing anything even if it was the correct color.  I contacted Well People, I thought they should know how bad the product was, and they didn't care. * W3ll people... we need to talk about the shade range. People with darker skin tones like makeup too yet the shade range completely excludes anyone beyond tan. Thankfully the darkest shade works for me so I enjoy the product but it's hard to get behind a brand that doesn't give darker skintones a thought. * I was really hoping this product would work for me but it didn't. I found the baked foundation to be much more drying than other pressed powders I've previously used. Felt like it didn't go on well and had horrible coverage. Will not be buying again. * Takes forever to build up. Not for anyone who wants medium to full coverage. Light to medium at best. * Honestly if you're looking for a foundation to take a chance on.. this is definitely it. I'm not sure why I even chose to buy this but I love it!! I use it over concealer and it evens out my skin tone perfectly. Also does not make me look too orangey or cakey. * Just meh"

It was so easy to apply, felt nice on my skin, looks natural and I think m10 is my shade - it is spot on (for my beautiful summer complexion ) I'm excited to have found Mented! not a con for me, because i don't choose a makeup to smell good, but definitely seems like fragrance wasn't added.

I have pretty dry sky so I know to add a moisturizer before applying this. I am not saying this drying…but makeup ondry skin can appear patchy * This product feels and looks like you have no product on. * I have searched for the perfect match years! So excited to have finally found a shade so spot on with my skin tone that it's almost scary. The stick foundation is easy to apply, blends well and leaves me a great natural glow. * Looked awful on me. Horrible on oily skin and def dont get if you have light skin. This foundation isnt made for light skin tones which sucks. * Perfect match almost feels like a tinted moisturizer. I'm oily so I still need a powder but for stick makeup it goes on smooth and doesn't run off. I'm sold * Okay so hear me out.. the color match to my skin is amazing!!! it blended beautifully. However, I have combo oily skin and nothing could have prepared me for how shiny and oily this foundation is. This is not a matte foundation so beware!! * Hidden Gem hands down. I have been looking for a good foundation in general for a few years now, I went high end low end drugstore I went tinted moisturizer to full coverage and non did what I actually wanted. I love make up but finding a good foundation for my oily skin that wont force me to re touch (which I'm horrible at by the way, always makes it worse) was close to impossible without making me feel like I have pounds of make up on especially for work. I had tried the Hourglass foundation stick which was highly rated and felt very chalky on my skin. I did a search of stick foundations and came across this one. I am the lightest shade in this line and am on my way to re up for a 3rd time! I have never purchased 1 item more than once since they end up not working out for a while. The coverage is amazing from one layer to a 2 layers if I want a fuller look. It glides on like butter on my skin  and gives me a glow without an oily look if that makes sense. I rarely have to completely set my face because it sets so nice on its own and will literally last me over 9 hours without any cracks or separation and looks like I just applied it minutes ago. It makes my face feel hydrated and not like I'm wearing loads of make up. This is a long review and I never leave a review but I am truly in love with this foundation! I am so thankful for this brand because I am the in between when it comes to make up, I'm a semy fare complexion with neutral undertones. Many lines have a Yellow undertone or an olive undertone which makes me look washed out. This is truly a bang for your buck and will leave your make up looking flawless."

I can go on about this foundation forever. I have very pale, dry skin, this shade range cancels out any issues ive had with light foundations that are too orange, does not stick to or emphasize when i have dryness. I 100% recommend this product. * This doesn't settle in wrinkles like a lot of foundation.  It is a bit hard to use to start with but once you figure it out it's very nice.  Good for older and younger skin.  I'm 64 and it's the best I've ever used. * This foundation is perfect for evening out skin tone without making it look like you painted your make up on. I really love pairing it with cream contour and cream blush, and then just setting it with a setting spray- it gives a gorgeous dewy finish. You can set it with powder to make it a little more long lasting too. I always try to catch it on sale. I think having a gorgeous light coverage foundation like this is perfect for an interview, meeting someone new, or embracing your natural beauty! Its made me feel so much more confident in my own skin. * The origin to my villain story. I listened to an ULTA employee, first foundation for my high school homecoming. Three days later I broke out, having clear skin all my life. Ever since, it never stopped. I had to go on meds to cure my acne. Don't use. * I used to use the old face and body without the radiance and always loved it so im not surprised I love the new version especially because I like more of a sheen/glow to my skin. This is a very sheer coverage foundation but is buildable if you want a little more coverage. Also I can apply this over my skincare without it pilling! * I never tried the original face and body. Honestly, I was never interested in this foundation until I started watching Miss Megan Robinson on tik tok. Seriously you NEED to follow her!! I generally have oily skin. It's been a lot more calm, and a lot less oily after I got rid of all the actives, and JUST started washing, toning, and using AN OIL (I know right, but it's true, oil loves oil, using an oil will keep your skin from producing a lot of oil) I can now wear this foundation confidently, and it is BEAUTIFUL!! It's friction activated so I suggest applying with fingers and rubbing it in so you can start to feel the ""gripping and thickening"" action that happens with this foundation(which is the best most fun part for me). The coverage is obviously light but it looks like perfected skin. Only the best things are peeking through. Everything blends nicely on top, and I mean EVERYTHING, from all different brands. It wears great too and looks even better as the day goes on. Its softly radiant and skin like if you powder (which I still do) and if you don't you'll look like a freshly hot glazed donut (some people like that, some people don't) I get the hype of this foundation and dare I say it's made it into my top 5 line up!!?? Coming from an oily girl that is shocking. If you're wondering, I use the Danessa Myricks yummy skin balm in translucent as a primer, this foundation, all my other creams and liquids, and I set with Mac studio fix powder and one size setting spray. PERFECTED NATURAL RADIANT SKIN * Wear it everyday and have received unprovoked complements."

It's definitely full coverage. It look so beautiful like natural skin! It doesn't dry matte, so definitely set it with powder. I'd say a little goes a long way! It last all day & still look beautiful even after a workout. The only areas that would slightly crease would be around my smile lines & chin but nothing crazy. I wish the foundation would be more available but it's so hard to find & the shade range isn't the best but overall 10/10 I would recommend! My closest shade is A05.5. I also tried mixing V05 & V04 to get my shade if anyone is wondering. I hope this helps.  :) * Coming from an Ulta Employee, after trying every foundation under the sun, this foundation makes my skin look FLAWLESS, airbrushed, smooth. I do have to set with a translucent loose powder because it is still a little tacky in my opinion. Shades are FANTASTIC. A02 matches me the closest; however if there was a slightly paler shade with a yellow undertone that would be my perfect match. I ordered A01 and A02 on YesStyle and to me 1 was almost darker than 2, but it may just be the undertones. ULTA PLEASE BRING THIS BACK. It took me over a week with express shipping on YS btw I paid $19 extra FYI In case anyone was going to order it, I think it ships from China. Idk what is in this foundation but  I want to buy every bottle just incase it ever gets discontinued😅😭😭😭 * My relationship with foundation is a nightmare,I'm a brown skin girl with golden undertones in the summer and pale skin in the winter,without much prep this foundation matched me perfectly and stayed on ALL NIGHT,the a night of dancing 💕LOVE THIS STUFF * Please restock ASAP! This is my favorite foundation!! I literally bought 3 bottles because I have a feeling Ulta might discontinue this foundation...
 FYI- you can still find VDL on Yesstyle BUT it's NOT the same foundation. The one on Yesstyle has SPF & it has more of a dewy finish 😩 * I hope Ulta is not going to stop selling this foundation. It is an amazing satin finish foundation. Looks flawless on the skin and makes blemished skin look smooth. Wears beautifully throughout the day and is full coverage. Highly recommend. FYI if they stop selling it at Ulta you can find it on YesStyle. * I bought this foundation in the color A06. I tend to have a hard time finding foundations because I am in the weird shade range where I'm typically between medium/tan and dark/deep in various brands. I have Neutral slightly golden/olive undertones and find that many brands get close but not perfectly my shade. Most times foundations are too golden (almost orange looking), too cool, exactly neutral when I need just a touch of yellow in the foundation, or they just skip my shade altogether. I was pleasantly surprised when this foundation was an exact match. I love the natural finish to this foundation. I have dehydrated combo skin that if not properly hydrated will get oily in the t-zone (mostly nose area) and will remain normal or slightly dry everywhere else. When I wear this for several hours my foundation goes from very natural to radiant but not oily as my t-zone starts to break into a bit of a shine. I really don't have anything bad to say about this foundation except because of the limited shade range there's a chance you may not find a good match depending on your skin tone and undertone. Hopefully Ulta continues to keep this foundation available. * I would describe this foundation on my skin as full coverage with a satin/slight dewy finish. I have acne prone skin with acne scars and this foundation covers everything without causing any texture. Long wearing and mask proof. Doesn't cause breakouts. Would recommend for various skin types."

The ""creamy"" title is very deceiving though. It's powder. And quite drying immediately on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this for aging skin whatsoever. Great product for on the go touch ups on oily skin. * I don't care for the sponge applicator because it really doesn't go on right, but I found that using a brush to apply is so much better and it goes on more evenly.  You can add more where needed without it looking blotchy.  I love it! Used the color Sienna * Goes smooth and cover some imperfections, but looks natural. Leaves your skin soft and beautiful. * Lightest shade, Ivory.  You MUST prep the skin with moisturizer, sunscreen and either CT Hollywood Flawless Filter or the Maybeline knockoff or a dewy primer or sunscreen.  Buff in with a brush after applying concealer where needed.  Use powder bronzer, blush and highlight and a setting spray.  It looked amazing on my 48 year old dry skin and lasted all day.  Not powdery, didn't settle in lines, let's your skin peek through (is light coverage).   I really love it. * I thought since it's called age perfect it would be a moisturizing creamy powder. Nope. It's super drying and I have combination oily skin not even dry. Feels horrible right on application You can feel the makeup. Didn't blur anything. I had to take it off within 10 mins of application. Don't buy this stuff. * I wanted to try a cream to powder foundation to try to cover some dark spots. 
This covered what I wanted. It does look a little dry after application but I'm oily so it looks more natural after a few hours. * I love the age rewind concealer and seen this after looking for a good powder foundation. it is a really creamy, finely milled powder. I don't think it's really pigmented but you get enough coverage to even everything out and in my opinion it really does blur. I use a flat top Kabuki brush to buff it in, slowly building up layers. I take product and tap it in where I need more coverage with a concealer brush. I find I get the most coverage this way. it's like your skin but better. gives you a nice natural finish and doesn't look cakey if you slowly buff and build. will be trying this as a setting powder for liquid since it blurs. it also doesn't make me breakout!"

Unfortunately, This product didn't work for my dry skin. And for the price I doesn't have great coverage. I don't see this product any different from any other pressed powder. Also, this powder has sparkles in it I guess to conceal how drying and powdery it makes the skin.. * I love this powder, my skin is dry but this powder always feels comfortable on, never adds any texture as other powders have for me in the past, def one of my fav powders * I LOVE this pressed powder! It takes away the look of shine and makes my skin look refined and even toned. I bought Ivory and it is the ideal shade for my skin tone, medium fair with pink undertones. It works well worn over concealer and foundation, or on its own. And, better still, it looks invisible and feels like nothing on skin! The mirrored compact is the perfect size for taking on the go and it even comes with an applicator sponge on a clear, hinged divider inside. Hynt thought of everything with this pressed powder! I will definitely buy again:) * I've always been reluctant to wear powder - most of the time I end up looking cake-y. This finishing powder is a game changer - so easy to apply and bonus, the packaging is so adorable! But more importantly my skin looks so velvety and super plump, definitely will be coming back for more when I'm through with this! * Love using this powder in-between zoom meetings to touch up my skin. Just gives me a more even/finished and natural look * One of my favorite products from Hynt * I used this foundation with the foam puff it came packaged with. Do not use with a brush, the powder is finely milled and will fall off your brush! I wore it over serum and moisturizer. My face got a little shiny throughout the day but that is common for me, as I have combination skin. I like that the coverage is buildable, I was able to apply two layers and achieved the coverage I was looking for. Best of all, the ingredients are natural and truly clean! No SLS, no parabens, no Lauryl Lysine, no Bismuth oxychloride! So happy Ulta is carrying this brand!"

I recommend performing a gentle face exfolation before bed time and removing any peach fuzz for any makeup aplication, not just this foundation. It makes a huge difference in aplication and appearance of the final look/finish.
It works best with the Vanish smoothing primer. (To smooth down the pores that every human being has) It is runny but extreamly pigmented. Do not use too much or it will look cakey.Best apply with a dense buffer brush (Morphe 444 is my favorite) and then press it in with a beauty blender. I use the professional Kryolan setting spray first, and then set it with a good powder.( Jeffree Star, Fenty or Kryolan powder) It holds for 14h even in humid Florida. Best foundation for events. It's best for normal/ combination skin. I wish they had more shades.
Unfortunately it just has been discontinued, tho the company has gave me insites that they are working on perfecting the formula and making a new foundation for combination/oily skin (they currently carry luminous foundations for normal/dry skin) * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * This product is so thin & runny! Like water consistency. I pumped one pump on my hand & it literally dripped off me. I shook the bottle so many times & it still remained runny. I gave it a try on my face because I wanted to give the foundation a chance but the product just settled right into any crevice it could. I could literally see wrinkles/lines I didn't even know I had. * I got this during a sale and was so excited to try my first Hourglass product. I followed the instructions and reviews and only used a very little amount. It brings out my pores horribly, dries down very weird and makes my skin dry, and even though it feels light on my skin my skin feels a tiny bit sticky, not something I usually experience with prestige brand foundations. This is a miss for me. * This foundation is very reminiscent of Marc Jacob's 'Remarcable' . Full coverage and matte with a pore filling matte primer underneath . The bad reviews are really just people who don't know how to apply makeup . * Words do not explain how buttery this foundation is I have dry to normal skin and it blends it two to three glides. Will never use another foundation"

I have combo oily skin and so far regardless of the primer or moisturizer this just doesn't look good and will break down. I've been using juvias place which I like ten times better and I don't have to try to make it work. This foundation also oxidizes orange..so not just a shade but it'll turn more orange as well. I'm gonna try to find something to mjx it with but I won't be purchasing again and wouldn't recommend it. * I have oily combo skin, and this foundation did not stand the test of time. It felt very heavy, and transferred with the slightest touch (with setting powder). Only a few hours in, and it was breaking apart on my face, highlighting even the slightest texture. My pores were literally drinking this product up. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a foundation, and could not wait to take it off. * I have combo skin, I use the Bobby brown moisturizer primer underneath and only use a tiny bit with a brush. Looks flawless!! Do not use to much product otherwise it will look cakey, if you need extra coverage apply only to specific area with smaller brush. * 32f (no active breakout/indented scars only on cheeks/combination skin)This foundation has the worst formula I have ever used on my skin. I tried two different primers underneath and tried it on it's own and it just refused to settle or smooth out. It creases badly and makes skin look dry and caked with very minimal use of the product that looked worse and worse if you tried to use even a tiny bit more. Powders and setting spray do nothing to help. I tried beauty blenders and brushes and neither made it better. I ended up going back to a trusty Revlon foundation that was way cheaper and a much better formula. Do not waste your money if you do not have perfect smooth skin. * I have sensitive skin with large amounts of rosacea and occasional eczema. This product covers my redness very well, and can many my dry areas seemingly disappear. Smashbox was also a line that came up multiple times during my search for products best for sensitive skin. * Maybe this just doesn't work with some skin types. I've given this several goes with different amounts of product and application techniques and it always manages to cake up and accentuate every pore after it's settled. I decided to give this one more go, applying after a glowy moisturizer that managed to save some of my other cakey products and it still had the same issues after setting for about 20 minutes. * It has perfect coverage,  a very little goes a long way.  Love the Matt finish I got.  Like  all foundations,  you have to prepare your skin before you applying anything to it.  Use a brush to apply.  I patted it on."
