1,urban decay,face bond self-setting waterproof foundation,pimprod2044818,2623593," * I would buy this product again and again! The Face Bond Self-Setting Waterproof Foundation is honestly one of the best foundations I've ever used. The coverage is excellent - it evens out my skin tone perfectly without feeling heavy or cakey. I love that it's self-setting, so I don't need to use extra powder, and it stays in place all day.
It feels lightweight on the skin, looks very natural, and really is waterproof. Even after a long day, my makeup still looks fresh and smooth.
If you're looking for a long-lasting, comfortable foundation with great coverage, I highly recommend this one! * I had loved how this foundation looked on skin. Very smooth and lasted all day easily. Minimizing my texture and pores. It sat so pretty. The reason why I have to remove a star and can't continue to use this makeup is due to burning skin reaction I got at work in the middle of the day. My skin literally started to itch and burn on the cheeks. I had to run to drugstore to buy makeup wipes. Please stop adding Niacinamide to foundation, Face Bond has 3% Niacinamide and most skincare has it too. Most makeup has it now when it sensitizes people's skin. Niacinamide is added in skincare and makeup is being advertised as skin care with over saturation of these active ingredients in everything now, it does not belong in foundation. Let customers decide their skincare routines. Also the fact this Face Bond has so much alcohol by day 3 of using this my skin literally screamed. But the makeup does look beautiful just the ingredients need to be better. Its half off i wonder if this is being phased out now. * With acne orobe skin, it is difficult to find a foundation. Howevr, face bibd has not caused any new breakouts. In fact, it is great with oil control, full coverage, and minimizing pores. It looks very natural without being cakey. The only warning is a hydrating lotion is needed uf uou have acne combo skin. * Color was way darker than the shade on the web, need a couple shades lighter but will consider purchasing again * I had been waiting a long time to try this and SO GLAD I did. Skin match is impeccable. Coverage is perfect for me. My only complaint is the size is so small. * This would be a nice product, just not for me.  Sits a little Cakey on my face, tried a couple different primers.  Just not meant for my skin type.  Lasts all day, and color match is pretty spot on….so I gave it three stars * After years of searching for a replacement for Hourglass Immaculate which was discontinued, I have finally found the one! Face Bond has beautiful coverage, is long lasting and does down nicely. Great for oily girls. Highly recommend!"

3,dior,dior forever fluid skin glow foundation,pimprod2036824,2605019," * I personally was not able to enjoy this product. I think it goes on beautifully and works for many people. However, if you have very sensitive skin like me, it might make you break out. I did a patch test and had a reaction to it. I was aware there was fragrance in it, however it was much more than anticipated. * Literally kicking myself for not trying skin glow sooner. Finish comparable to haus labs. Rivals the Dior skin perfect stick (my fav). Honestly puts Armani to shame. No cling to dry patches. Makes me want to cry how due to how pretty it is. lol * This foundation has a nice finish on my skin but it settles in every little line on my face, very disappointed. * 3rd time buying this. It blends perfectly, covers my fine lines, even my '11' line BUT BETTER THAN THAT- it covers my heavy rosacea on my cheeks. Love this product! * I love this product. It makes my face looks flawless and glowing,  I will recommend it to my friends * The foundation matches my skin tone perfectly. I was using another foundation before but found it very shear. This one covers but is not thick or caked on. It also has a nice scent to it. * The Dior Forever Foundation is absolutely amazing. It applies beautifully, evens out the skin tone, doesn't emphasize pores, and lasts all day without looking cakey. The skin looks fresh, smooth, and natural. It feels very comfortable on the skin and doesn't dry it out.
I'm very happy with the result — this is definitely a foundation I'll keep using and highly recommend."

I always receive many compliments when wearing. Its also not bad for my skin. Their glowy version is very good too! * I LOVE this product. It holds all day long and makes my face look fabulous! * IT DRIED MY SKIN * After every time i wore this i would break out in painful pimples. I would not  recomend for sensitive skin. * Long wearing, full coverage without caking or settling into fine lines. Perfection in a bottle! * I have been using this product for a good while. I sure hope they never stop this product. I've recommended this to many ladies * I've used this for years and it DOES stay on all day very well without being thick or caking and washes off easily."

8,nars,light reflecting advanced skincare foundation,pimprod2030141,2591117," * This is my all-time favorite foundation (and I have a lot including Haus Labs, Charlotte Tilbury, & Giorgio Armani to name a few). The finish is absolutely beautiful — it looks like real skin but better. It blurs pores and texture without being matte or heavy, and gives the perfect natural glow without looking oily or shiny. The coverage is buildable and never cakey, and it wears incredibly well throughout the day without breaking apart. It truly melts into the skin and makes my complexion look smooth, even, and healthy. I always come back to this one no matter what else I try * On my 37-year-old skin, this is pretty glorious. It's light, but you can build it where you need more coverage. It layers beautifully over SPF and sits under powder without getting cakey or weird.

It also doesn't LOOK like makeup. It just kind of melts in and makes my skin look more even and healthy instead of think and makeupy. It also doesn't sit in my fine lines like SO MANY other foundations!

Only downside is wear time. It's good through the workday, but by evening it's definitely fading. I wish it lasted a little longer, but it's still my go to foundation! * I love everything about this foundation. I also loved Sheer Glow and I wish i could still get it. These two NARS foundations and the RCC are the only ones to get it right for me. My only perfect shade, only con is the price! * I tend to stick to serum foundations and tints because of my dry skin since things normally cling to it and decided to buy this on a whim during an event at Ulta because it came with some freebies (which I also LOVED) and this foundation is gorgeous. I have always loved Nars products such as the glosses, blushes, bronzers and concealer, but never wanted to spend the money on a foundation until now. It looked like my skin but more polished and was the perfect base for the rest of my makeup. You have officially converted me.

Now if only Nars could bring back ""Sin"" blush in the new formula and they would make my day! * i LOVE this foundation. i struggle with hormonal cystic acne. always have and a lot of products worsen my skin. so much so that i stopped wearing makeup for about 2-3 years. i bought this foundation about two weeks ago and will for sure be buying more when i run out. the shade match is amazing, it doesnt oxidize at all. ive full on slept in my makeup and i wake up with no new pimples and no clogged pores. i pair it with other water based products and my skin is thriving! im so happy i found this foundation bc now i can wear my makeup without it feeling heavy and without causing new breakouts!😊 * I wanted to love this after reading the good reviews , but it made my face look pastie. Not at all what I expected from a high end foundation . * I typically wear light to light medium foundation shades and wanted to try something different since I wear Haus Lab but it oxidizes. I saw so many people use Nars and wanted to join in but I think my skin just hates me at this rate ;-; I purchased 3 shades lighter and I wore it as lightly as possible during the application process and within 4 hours my face looked darker than my entire body. It sucks since the foundation is super pricy and claims to be anti-oxidize when its seperating and oxidizing severely during light applications. I love how watery it is since it makes it easier and faster to deal with in the morning, but I guess I'll have to return it since it didnt work out. Oh, also, it causes breakouts if your combo/oily/acne prone skin regardless of primer."
9,mac,studio fix fluid spf15 24hr matte foundation + oil control,pimprod2044825,2622206," * I used to love this stuff so much. I went and bought my 3rd one a couple months ago but only recently opened it and I dont know if i got a bad batch or if the formula changed but i HATE it! It creased so bad, dried my skin out and made me look dry and dull. I thought maybe my skin was just dry so I did some hardcore prep beforehand and still nope. Unfortunately its been 3 months so I cant return this expensive foundation. I have since switched products. Im sad cause i loved this before but i cant just waste money on this stuff if its going to crease, dry me out and accentuate my pores 10x more than no makeup does… :( * I would buy over and over * . * They should have never changed the formula. The new colors and formulation are terrible. I used to be NW10 but the new one is nothing like the OG. Returning asap * I am light skinned but have a warm undertone and olive skin and when I went to the store the make artist recommended me NC17. I am not a fan of it because it leaves a visible layer on your skin and looks unnatural. It gives you that dried out look.. * Im very satisfied with my products 
I brought a friend with me that day and the girls tried the foundation in each one of bus and we love it and buy it
In the future I will bring more friends with me and yes I will love to continue buying this product * This foundation is truly unmatched. The finish, coverage, oil control, and wear time are perfection. Even in humid Houston weather!! It looks flawless on the skin all day without caking, separating, or breaking down, even on oily skin. It photographs beautifully and somehow still looks natural in person. I've tried countless foundations at every price point and always come back to this one. PLEASE never change this formula, it is absolute gold and a staple that outperforms everything else on the market."

Ive done makeup professionally. Ive used dozens and dozens of foundations from drug store to super highend. This is by far the best ive ever used. I also get compliments from strangers as well as med spa workers on how great my skin looks. Its from this product. Im truly blown away by it. The coverage and the finish are top notch and it last all day. Rihanna definitely knocked it out of the park with this one. * I AM A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE * I love this foundation! It provides the long lasting coverage I need and I get so many compliments! I have definitely spread the word that Fenty is it. My shade is 440. * Don't like really want my tarte back,been waiting for them to get restock in . * The color was too light"

14,it cosmetics,cc+ nude glow lightweight foundation + glow serum with spf 40,pimprod2031824,2594106," * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review]. This foundation is lightweight and hydrating with medium coverage. It gives my skin a healthy glow and it wears comfortably throughout the day. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This CC cream is perfect for those who don't want a heavy coverage. It looks perfectly natural and gives the skin a nice dewy finish. It's easy to use and blend in. I love that it has SPF coverage. * I really didn't know what to expect as I just bought it on a recommendation. I love it! It is very lightweight, makes me look dewy but not shiny, does not settle and makes me look like me but just a little better. I played with the shades in the store until I found mine. You wouldn't know I have it on unless I told you. Just gorgeous! * Great light weight base, and the tint matches my complection with a UV protection. Great for anytime of the year and goes great  with my other makeup. Highly recommend this tint and it lasts. * Does not have any coverage. Lightweight. Leaves a nice glow to your face. Makes it dewy. * Love the coverage and how well it blends. Love IT cosmetics! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I have used and loved It cosmetics for years. Primarily the CC foundations.  This is a great size for the value for the size. This has a medium-buildable coverage, with a dewy finish. This nude glow lightweight feels and smells like chemical sunscreen in my opinion. My least favorite of all of the cc creams I have tried. If they were able to make this scent free I would love it more!"
15,estee lauder,futurist hydra rescue moisturizing foundation spf 45,pimprod2013152,2577966," * Great product for mature skin. * I'm 42 and my skin is on the drier side. I was looking for an alternative to IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Foundation, because they don't make a color that matches my skin very well. This Estee Lauder foundation is a good color match, but it makes my skin look really dry. It doesn't last very long, and I don't like the added fragrance. * I was hoping this foundation would work for me since it was reviewed as good for sensitive skin.  It burnt my face and took a week to heal.  I would not buy this if you have sensitive skin.  If you don't have sensitive skin, it does provide nice coverage. * Thought I would splurge on this and wish I didn't. Within minutes this foundation settled into and accentuated every pore, line,  and wrinkle on my face. Trying yo get it to blend just makes it get mire blotchy. I am going to try to return it. I don't recommend this. * Crazy hydrating to the point it was an oil slick. I looked like a hormonal teen upon application. Also - what happened with the shades?? I'm a perfect match for 2C3 Fresco in EL's Double Wear foundation.  But this? Futurist Hydra in 2C3 Fresco is about 3-4 shades too light!! Completely different color/shade than Double Wear!! DEF SHADE UP (go WAY darker) with this!!  Not sure why shade matching had to be made so much more difficult that it already was, but dangit - $$ wasted. This stuff is also best for over 55yo skin imo, not those over 35yo that are just starting to get creasing & lines. Def best for VERY dry, post menopause, etc. I'm 45yo, & this was far too much ""hydration"" for me (didn't think that was possible - but it IS.) It just smeared all over my face like oil & transferred far too easily. It also didn't wear nearly as long as Double Wear, although I understand the difference, lol. BUT it was not at all creasey, nor dry & cakey, so for that, I gave it 3 stars. I can see this working great on me when I hit 55-60yo plus, but just not right now.  Pricey as all get-out too. Plz fix the shades to match your other foundation colors, it's ridiculously different! * This makeup has great coverage, matches skin tone better than most, lasts all day and just a very good makeup * Goes on smooth light weight great coverage.i will buy this product again .this is the first time I purchase this brand of foundation.
I rate it as a 10  ...,.............................................................................................."

17,pur,4-in-1 love your selfie longwear foundation & concealer,pimprod2005671,2544533," * After trying what feels like every foundation ever made I finally found PUR and I haven't looked back. The coverage is amazing and the finished look is so smooth and clean. I did read a few reviews talking about the finish and how it can leave your skin ""textured"", what I would recommend is to ensure you are using a good moisturizer and a well formulated primer that is compatible with the foundation. All primers do not work with all foundations formula wise and can therefore cause separation of the product. 😊 * I first got color matched in store with this brand in 2021 and after not being able to find it for a while thought it to be discontinued but im so happy its not! This is the best, checks all my boxes - great color match, redness control, extremely buildable, and does not break me out. 5 stars all the way!! * I've been using the 4-in-1 Love Your Selfie Longwear Foundation & Concealer for 4 years now, and honestly… nothing compares. I have normal/oily skin with most of my oil in the T-zone, and this foundation covers everything without feeling heavy or cakey.

Pro tip: prep is everything. Cleanse, moisturize, use a good primer, apply your foundation, then lock it in with a setting spray. When trying a new foundation, minor breakouts for the first couple of weeks can be normal, but if it keeps happening… it's probably not your match.

One bottle lasts me about 4–5 months, and I use it 2–5 times a week.
If you want longwear, full coverage, and real skin confidence, this is it. * absolutely  great color match.  Great texture and natural looking coverage * It leaves the skin with a terrible texture. * I've been wearing this makeup for quite a while. My biggest complaint is that I have to buy two different colors and blend them to get a decent color match. Other than that it's got great coverage. * PUR foundation is one of the best product used on my face! My photos are clear when used and makes me smile when I look at myself. Thank you!"
18,it cosmetics,cc+ cream natural matte foundation with spf 40,pimprod2044261,2621797," * For a while this wasnt being found in store or online the then it came back the packaging changed a bit and now the formula shcks :( you can see all your imperfections and it sinks into your pores making them appear larger * I love this foundation & use it regularly but am disappointed & frankly furious that the product I ordered on January 4th has a 3/2026 expiration date.. Guest services did not apologize and in fact indicated that since the product was not YET expired, my only recourse was to return it via mail or in a store within 30 days if I wanted a cash refund. Really? This product shouldn't even have been on a store or warehouse shelf this close to expiration. Check expiration dates, my fellow shoppers. And do better, MUCH BETTER, Ulta! * I have been using IT for years and years and decided to try the matte formula. For my skin, it is a no go! I'm 48 and have combo skin with dry patches. Even after my skincare routine and moisturizer this formula looked flat, cakey and uneven; it didn't go on smooth and emphasized all my dry spots. I'll stick with CC cream and glowy formulas. * I dislike the flat look of matte foundation. I love moisturizing look of it cosmetics foundations. I'll return and hoping ULTA will let me replace it. * This foundation takes  just a couple drops to get the entire face. I love it because it's not cakey and makes me look natural and like I'm not wearing any makeup. * Love that it's buildable coverage, a little goes a long way. I'm in my early 30s and it doesn't get cakey. By the end of the day I am a little shiny at times but it's nothing compared to other products. * For context, I have dry, sensitive skin with occasional breakouts. For years, it was the best foundation I used, until learning it permanently stained my towels and clothes. Initially, I thought the marks were from bleach, but later saw it was this foundation. This was a deal breaker; I cannot apply a formula to my skin that bleaches fabric. Frankly, I would give it five stars but cannot due this con. Pros: buildable coverage, natural matte— ""skin like"" finish, and excellent shade range."

20,fenty beauty by rihanna,eaze drop blurring skin tint,pimprod2031372,2592608," * Great product, beautiful light coverage, but doesnt apply well over dry skin. * I'm on my second bottle of this, and while it looks and wears great, I don't think it measures up to its nearly $40 pricepoint. I also wish it had some SPF (not even a lot, just some) since I like to just apply tints and go, not worry about SPF too. * Gives the look of refreshed and glowy without creasing * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Love this formula, I did get the wrong shade but with the use of my other products the base looks amazing. Very easy to use, blends beautifully definitely recommend for a everyday use base. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Blends very good. I wasn't crazy about the way it dried down. Made my skin dry. The shade was not a good match for me either. I thought the packaging was nice. It lasted a long time too. * I have been loving this skin tint and it is the first I have ever purchased. I looked at a ton and tested many and this was the best one I could find for under $50! It feels very nice on the skin and I just blend it woth a brush. It dries quickly but feels very smooth and covera up my redness quite well. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I'm very conflicted as I love Fenty brand, but this skin tint was not the greatest product I've tried as it oxidized very quickly and leaned orange on me. I got shade 2 (light with neutral undertones), which should have been light enough for my light skin, but it was unusable on its own due to the oxidization that would happen almost immediately. The formula of the tint is comfortable to use, but the coverage is absolutely minimal/negligible. When I put it on, it felt nice on the skin. But, again, due to thin coverage, it even looked like I put nothing on the skin until I built it up significantly. However, my skin did feel dry after I put this on. On the plus side, there's no fragrance in this product. Overall, I think it might maybe work for someone who has near-perfect skin where they just want to add a little something, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's used to using one product for coverage. This skin tint is a good base for other products that might need color correction to the tone, but not a wow product on its own."

23,morphe,lightform extended hydration foundation,pimprod2043869,2621355," * I used to use Neutrogena serum foundation for sensitive skin. It was rhe beat foundation I've ever used but I am now making sure everything I use is cruelty free. Morphe foundation is awesome! I combine it with the cocokind gel cream moisturizer because I need the extra hydration. They combine nicely. And this foundation is a great deal. I tried some more expensive ""hydrating"" foundations from other companies and my skin looked awful. * I've only been using this for a few days, but I like it a lot. It's got excellent coverage and a nice glow to it, similar to NARS. 

I'm oily and acne prone and this works pretty well. The only issue I've had is that it really doesn't build well. It gets cakey if you apply too much, so i would just cover problem spots with concealer and keep to one (maybe two) light layers of this foundation.

Overall, I'm very impressed, especially for the price. It feels prestige to me. I also got a really good color match right off the bat, despite ordering online. Thanks Morphe!! * I love this foundation!! Not only does it stay on my face, but its also reasonably priced! I've been using this foundation for what seems like forever, but they recently sold out of my shade everyone- on the Morphe website too. I have tried 3 foundations since running out and have not found anything that even compares to the Morphe foundation. Hoping they restock because I am over using bad foundations! * I need to bring the Lightform Extended Hydration foundation back or a trade it for the correct shade. Please advise * I love the coverage and the natural look it gives worth it's money * I bought this foundation 2weeks ago. I love how it goes on with my Morphe brush! I also use the Sunrise powder & all the eye make. I have gotten compliments on my make up. So far I'm very happy with my Morphe products! * Was sold out before Christmas and I was bummed. Tried another day and it was not only back in stock, but on sale!! I'm 59 yo, and have super dry skin with rosacea as well. The formula is fairly thin/runny but it covers ssooo nicely. It's buildable without looking thick/heavy. Skin prep was; a rice toner, Neutrogena Hydro Boost serum and Hydro Boost water gel moisturizer and ELF power grip primer. Color is Light 06C"
24,tarte,face tape full coverage foundation,pimprod2003933,2540290," * I bought this since I had such good luck with other Tarte products. This makeup slides off my face by noon. It's awful. If you have combination or oily skin. Don't bother. * I put it on and it made me look like a ghost, my naturally rosy cheeks were just flat and pale so it definitely is full coverage. Its possible i didnt get the right undertone. Other than that it did separate on my skin around my mouth and nose. I ended up returning this i didnt want to pay almost 50 dollars if i didnt love it * I have really pale skin. I loved my Dior foundation but by the end of the day it was seperating and looking a little oxidized. This is a full coverage foundation, works great with my oily/combo skin, and the color stays true all day. I have the lightest color and it's a great match for my rosy pale skin. * I am dumbfounded. As a cheap drug store foundation user for decades, this changed my life. Goes on SO smooth, is creamy, doesn't crease, & my skin actually *looks better* when it's removed (vs the old days where foundations wrecked your skin, so you had to use double the next day lol. Great business model. Not so great for us tho.) This is FULL coverage, very hydrating without being an oil slick, & goes on so easily, you can nearly toss it on your face from 12"" away & it will still look like flawless perfection. Does not transfer at all for 24hrs minimum, if set with light powder or a setting spray. I'm so mad I wasted many decades NOT using this. I look 10yrs younger now!! Check for sales on Tarte's site, or sign up as a Tarte VIP to try at half price, various times of the year. You will NOT regret it, wow!! TY Tarte, for such beauty!! * Amazing coverage, blends easily
I set with a little powder and a setting spray and it stays fresh looking all day!! Doesn't oxidize on me. I love it!!! * Like the title says, i love tarte but i do not love this foundation. It clings to all your imperfections and accentuates all the texture on your skin. I say that as a 30 year old with good skin * I really like this foundation, but it has a super odd smell to it. Whenever I wear it, I can smell it all day. Otherwise, it lays well, so I am disappointed that I can't wear it without being so aware of it."

If you have dry skin definitely use moisturizer prior to using. Just after a few hours of wear turns orange!! * This is suchhhh a good skin tint! Its a skin tint but it has enough coverage to cover my acne but doesnt look cakey and its infused with vitamin C so going to brighten over time! And the best thing is it actually stays on all day! Which was huge for me, I worked nine hours yesterday and my makeup wore off around my mouth but everywhere else still looked really good! * Okay this has insanely mixed reviews, and I realised that with this tint it's all about the prep. Make sure you've got a *very* moisturised base before putting it on. I wore this all day for about 14 hours and it didn't budge, there was no creasing or dry patches. I noticed that after a few hours it was looking a little shiny in the places I didn't powder, so if you have oily skin (I have normal skin), be aware of that. But it honestly didn't get oily and start breaking apart in places or anything. I think it's got great coverage, but it's not cakey. Start by applying a thin layer and build up from there, and it shouldn't look cakey. I'm honestly really happy with the purchase, it's the first skin tint I'm trying. Before this, I only used the L'Oréal Infallible foundation and to be honest, this is much better. I liked the finish of the L'Oreal but this Maybelline is longer lasting and looks flawless on the skin. It's also easy to add products to it after application, it doesn't dry super fast. * The coverage, the finish, love EVERYTHING except the smell. It is sooooooo strong, I can smell it all day. It is not pleasant. I understand why, with the ingredients it has, but ugh, I can't find anything like it formula wise. I may just suck it up and deal with the smell! * My holy grail for a skin tint that's affordable. Its the only foundation/skin tint that ive found that doesnt crease in the smile lines. Its a game changer if that is a issue that you deal with as well.  Its also the most skin like and last all day long. * It went on very well and felt really nice. A few hours later, I was orange (oxidation) with texture like tree bark. I looked like a wizened gnome. For reference, however, I'm mature with slightly dry skin, living in a low humidity climate. People not in these categories should look at other reviews."
28,beautycounter,skin twin featherweight foundation,pimprod2038184,2606483," * I truely like the way the foundation glides on and covers. * I had high hopes for this foundation, considering all the positive reviews, but I found it to be subpar. The smell was absolutely terrible, I found the coverage to be uneven, and after an hour or so of wear, I looked in the mirror and it really exaggerated my fine lines and pores. I for sure would not recommend this foundation to anybody over the age of 35. * This is a no for me. It smells terrible and does not work on my skin. Exaggerates dry spots, separates in oily areas, and looks cakey with any amount of product. I've tried applying with fingers, brushes, and sponges. I'm really disappointed I spent so much on it. Drugstore foundations are much better quality than this one! * This is a difficult foundation to work with, the coverage never looks even to me and it's not buildable. up close, I can see it pills on my skin if I pass the sponge over it more than a couple of times. cream products don't layer over it well - it's hard to blend cream blush, bronzer and highlighter on top and it transfers and moves all over the face. It doesn't really set down, even with powder. I have dry skin and never have issues with uneven coverage or getting a foundation to set down, with or without setting powder. I'm just not a fan, I have wet n wild, Catrice, urban decay and Pat McGrath foundations that all perform better across the cost spectrum. * This a wonderful foundation. It gives perfect coverage, making my skin look dewy and fresh.   The best part is that it is a clean product, without the bad stuff.I love this brand. * Not enough coverage for my aging skin! * Unsure. It's not like it's a bad product. I feel it's good quality. I think maybe for a lighter foundation could be a good find. I feel for the price, what my expectations were; not a good buy necessarily. Fell a bit flat for me. I've also only used a couple (2-3) times. Maybe it grows. My skin feels nice.
I don't feel excited afterwords-if that makes sense? Sometimes I put on foundation and I'm like ""OO-Hello there!"" I put this on and feel like…ehh. Best way I can put it. I did have a more positive prospective when adding a glow enhancer. It's ok."

I went with the Medium shade because Light was super white on me. The Medium shade looked good in the compact while I was at the store, but after putting it on in better lighting it showed as peach on me. Not a good look! The longer I wore it, the more orange it became. Returned. * Love it! I have very oily, acne prone skin, but this powder is a miracle worker! It controls the oil, covers all my unevenness and cystic acne scars. I feel like I have finally found my forever powder foundation. I am 61 years old, and I have spent a lot of money thru the years trying to find something that gave me good coverage and not make me oily. This is it. Hoping that It Cosmetics never changes this powder. * Goes on smooth as a finish. Works well and does not crease. It is my go to! * A light feeling medium coverage foundation that does not enhance deep wrinkles. It is perfect for a natural look. * Love the cc+ plus brand all together! Use all their products for my face & always get compliments. Nice recommendation from the store associate & overall good experience! Will buy again!! * I don't understand why all the negative reviews. first this powder is amazing, it's lightweight but you can apply more for more coverage. I FINALLY FOUND A POWDER THAT COVERS ALL THE REDNESS ON MY CHEEKS! no joke. it doesn't cause my face to look oily, no blotting sheets necessary. it lasts all day. another thing is I appreciate the small pad that comes with the powder just in case you want to reapply in the middle of the day, but the good news is I can leave my powder at home, because it lasts throughout my day. people compliment me & wonder what I am using. I buy another powder and always go back to this one. it doesn't sink into your pores and make them look huge or settle in the creases of your face, it just looks natural not a cakey powder. & no more redness. I do use the liquid foundation on some days and I love it too! can't go wrong with this powder."

Lovely!! I like it so much, I bought another bottle just in case  they discontinue this. And the match was perfect! Transfer proof-check, sweat proof, check, and it feels so light on my face. I will be buying this again for sure! * This foundation to so good. I'd put it one par with Estee Lauder Double Wear. Similar but better. Looks like skin. Super light weight and give full coverage.

I usually buy NARS or other high end and this is the best coverage for value. I'm 47 and it covers without caking or creasing. Love it! * Um…idk if its the vitamin C or what because I used this for about 3 weeks straight and my skin was the worst its ever been. I bought this after hearing about it for years and gave it a solid try. Its been 3 weeks since i stopped using it and my skin is STILL recovering. It looked like someone splashed oil on my skin no exaggeration. Dryness is still an issue and im almost sure this partially aged me a little. I had a painful rash on my chin and cheeks and it hurt so bad to even put my moisturizer ive used for years which is unusual. Do not buy. This will straight up ruin your skin. * My skin!

I hate it ! * I have been using this product for more then three years and I must say I wish this tone was sold in stores instead of online because it's not fair that I have to pay for shipping when I can just go to my local store. * This new MATTE version of the Barepro 24 hour liquid foundation is wrong in so many ways. 1) There are less color shades to select from, so finding the perfect match no longer exists.  2) The new color shades are not even close to the same as the prior shades based on Barepro's new color chart.  3) The MATTE formula ends up looking cakey during the day because all the facial moisture is being absorbed.  4) The foundation has an unpleasant odor.   ***Please bring back the prior formula and color shades!!!*** * This is the second time I have tried to match my shade since Bare Minerals discontinued many of their shades.

I normally wear a Fair/Fair Light Warm, and the ""Fair Warm"" I received looks more like a Light/Medium Warm, so it's a much deeper shade than I expected. * You can wear it very sheer like a tinted moisturizer. It has great skin care, benefits, including hydration, poor minimizing, and brightening. You can also build it up to medium or full coverage. It's never cakey or thick. I love it! * honestly this is my favorite foundation on the market. BUT PLEASE CHANGE THE BOTTLE AND THE PUMP. * I purchased shade Very Light Neutral and I'm happy with my purchase. I am a foundation girlie!  I was not gifted this item. I spent my money on it. I think that matters when giving opinions on products. I would consider this a medium coverage, I use the Polite Society peach loose powder to set. It doesn't last all day, but, it stays pretty for several hours. I haven't had problems with the pump like others have and the cap is a little difficult to get off sometimes, but I would purchase again.m formula works well with my skin. * This did not apply well, it was really thin and kind of streaky.. It did build well once I got it smoothed out, but it didn't last very long and made my face feel oily. * I love this foundation. But i wish they would create another type of dispenser. The pump is not user friendly at all. * This is the best for long wear. Highly recommend it"

I think people with oilier skin will like this foundation more than dry skin people.  But I didn't have any rashes from this foundation and I do have sensitive skin. * Really like this foundation. Doesn't break me out. Wears well when set witb powder. I loke the fuller coverage and SPF. But like many with pale skin, I'm cool toned. CN Breeze cool-neutral clearly has yellow in it. Which makes sense as itnis cool-neutral. So it doesn't work for me. My skin should not be yellow. Males my pink skin look sick and sallow. Some true fair/light cool shades would be great. * Even with exfoliating and moisturizing before applying, it seriously dried my skin out. * I do not like the way it feels on my face.

And you dont need to use a lot of product to have good results * I really like the change in my appearance.

The coverage is perfect and last all day long for me. * Ulta to my surprise doesnt seem to sell the refill size pans (which are only like $39 [usa]) so they dont even bother to mention that they exist at all!   What a shame because its much better for the environment to just buy refill pans after getting the full component.  Its also meant to be a great way to keep the product affordable!    Go check out the ND website or beautylish for refill purchasing. * Very good product I will buy again. * This powder foundation lives up to the hype. Great coverage that is buildable and wears well, even with my oily complexion. The Ulta associate really helped me find the best color match, as there are many shades available for this foundation. * I absolutely love this powder. I struggle with getting the right coverage for my skin type (sensitive, rosacea) with liquid foundation. I prefer a more natural look and this made me look airbrushed as well! * I bought this powder foundation after reading reviews and wish I had bought it sooner! Good coverage and doesn't settle into my pores or wrinkles like other products I've tried. Doesn't oxidize or turn orangey after a few hours of wear and last well throughout the day.

I have gotten away with using this prouduct without setting powder and it still looked great at the end of the day! 10/10 recommend trying if you have acne prone skin * I would go as far to say this is one of the best skin tints on the market! It is better than lots of high end skin tints i have tried! Super lightweight but still evens out my skintone and is super buildable! * Every time i put it on it began to pell and separate * I used the ""find my shade"" based off of foundations I wear now and the suggestion was a 2-3 which made me look like I had jaundice-way too yellow and a bit too dark.  So, I tried the 1-2.5, which is better,  but way too light.  The 3-4 looks orange in the bottle and the 4-5 looks way too dark.  So, I think I am stuck with the 1-2.5 and having to use another foundation on top of it-which makes it look cakey and draws attention to my fine lines that I was trying to correct by trying this product.  I have only worn it twice now, but it does seem to help with my dry, flakey skin so far.  I probably will not buy again. * I do like this serum, it is slightly buildable, very light weight. Doesn't feel like a foundation which I like for light coverage days. Only thing I don't like about it is the applicator. It's messy and every time I use it, I end up getting some on my counter. * This is my holy grail. I work in the beauty industry. I have tried any and everything from lightweight to full coverage. This is by far my favorite and i have repurchased it multiple times. It gives the skin a beautiful very natural look and feel. I have blotchy skin with suns spots and redness and i just wanted something to even it out wothout looking heavy. This does the job and very well! * FINALLY! A foundation that does not make my almost 66 year old skin look dry and cakey! Don't be taken aback by its thin consistency! This foundation glides smoothly across my skin and provides medium coverage that is buildable. Works well with other cream and powder products. Did not break my Social Security pocketbook! Just because we are of a certain age does not mean we can't have a little fun with our cosmetics and feel better about ourselves. I LOVE make-up. I have many foundations of all price ranges and brands. This one is as good or Better than any of them! I have used Dior, Estee Lauder. Elizabeth Arden, Make-up by Mario, just to name a very few. I might compare this one to Haus Labs as far as coverage and ease of application. Go somewhere where you can sample to purchase to get your right shade. I do not believe you will be disappointed.

The other is double wear. I am light medium olive and use either 5.5N or 6N depending upon the time of year.  My skin is on the drier side skin but I have no issues . I do however hydrate properly. Toner or Serum, moisturizer and then the glow serum. Foundation, setting powder and setting spray, It stays well. * Checks all the boxes: 
Skin type: oily
Coverage needs: full
Longwearing: excelent 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED * I like it. My shade sent was a little too light so I mixed it with a darker color. It is creamy and provides good coverage. * Light/med shade with neutral undertone, mature skin. sadly it's separated a lot throughout the day. I'm not sure if I was using the wrong primer or my sunblock was too sheer, but I really struggled with this foundation * Unfortunately, this was one of the foundations i wanted to purchase for a long time. I finally did when it went on sale. Maybe it's my skin. But this is total failure for me. The color changes and becomes more drier. * Doesn't settle in creases moisturizing and breathable all at once and truly stars all day!"
43,it cosmetics,your skin but better foundation + skincare,pimprod2017112,2568683," * I'm so glad I try new things because this foundation is phenomenal. I am 60 years old and it gives me enough coverage. Also gives me a nice glow. My face looks refreshed and so much younger anyway best foundation I've tried in a long time. We'll definitely be buying again. * First  foundation that actually matched my skin, literally covers everything ans stays on, i wanted to love it but on my first try I noticed dry brown patches after I cleaned my face and  was very dry, not for me 😞 * I love this foundation, it is very lightweight so I had to use a heavy moisturizer and thick primer. It worked well with both NYX and Provedence drugstore primers.

Also my deep skin discoloration are covered with a tiny amount. I use liquid bronzer and blush with it and it pairs well with Pacifica and Maybelline liquid products. Once this foundation dries on your skin, it will break up if you add liquid or oil makeup on top- but as long as I do it all at one it sets the makeup and last for my work day. 

FYI I set my face with pixi skin veil and it wasn't too drying on my dry skin. They recommended I get a shade lighter foundation to cover and it gave me full coverage. The only con is my local Ulta doesn't sell it so I have to buy online. * this is so watery I don't even know how you're supposed to apply it. I wore it for one day and within a few hours started developing a severe rash on my skin that has lasted for several days. would not recommend. * I'm obsessed with this foundation! You don't feel like you are wearing anything! It's life changing! * This is actually a first… I've never experienced a foundation that manages to be extremely watery, yet also cakey at the same time. Unsure what kind of mystery this is, because it's certainly not a good one. Color was also extremely off and orange. Also more on the natural matte side, NOT radiant like it says. * This foundation does exactly what it says,"" Your skin but better"". Absolutely love this foundation."
44,tarte,amazonian clay 16-hour full coverage foundation,pimprod2025023,2581375," * Im surprised to see all the bad reviews. This foundation is great for oily skin and it covers my hyperpigmentation. This foundation is the inly foundation that I can use without concealer. I hace acne prone skin and it does not make me break out. * It feels nice on, but it is incredibly flakey and caking. Color was a good match but it made my natural skin look worse. * I love it * I picked this up because of the long wear foundation claims, and it has been a major disappointment. My skin gets so oily with this product that when I take my makeup off there's hardly any product to remove, despite the fact that I applied a whole face of makeup in the morning. My skin literally eats this product for breakfast. It lasts about 4 or 5 hours, then I'm an oil slick. Worse, its so thick and cakey and just doesn't blend out the way a high end foundation should. 

One of the most awful purchases I've made in recent memory. Their ""longwear"" claim should be considered false advertising. * I don't use foundation everyday so I made a bottle of their old formula last a long time. But the time came for me to buy a new bottle. They don't carry my original shade so bought what I researched to be the closest in their new line. I compared the new and old and they're pretty close. What shocked me was how scented this product is now! Why! I read that they wanted to mask the earthy smell of the clay and target the larger demographic that likes their products to smell like synthetic fragrance. I am bummed about that because I originally bought Tarte for the fact they used pretty straightforward ingredients. It's also nearly impossible to find foundations that don't use chemical SPFs, which are not great for the skin long term, like using a zinc formula would be. I'll try this out for a month and see  if it still breathes the same way the old formula did. Loved how it used to blend so beautifully into the texture of my skin. I do recommend putting an eye dropper full of jojoba oil before applying the foundation to give a more dewy end result. * I finally found something that doesn't make me look like I'm wearing makeup, but I feel naturally beautiful ! * Was tired of powder foundations found my correct match with 5tarte cosmetics6. Love the application, ble b ding is easy. Husband loves how my fa5ce look using this product."

It made my skin feel REALLY good almost like a velvety texture. I was obssesed. My skin even felt good when i took it off. However, the next couple of times i tried it on, i started to notice it seperates on my skin. My makeup would create a line on my forhead from where it would start seperating. I do not have very oily skin. I have normal combination and makeup seperating on me has never been an issue before. * Not good for Dry skin, made me look very textured which I'm not normally * It did not take long for me to absolutely fall in love with this foundation!! It's lightweight and has great coverage for being a ""natural"" looking foundation. It has a matte finish, but it also has some glow to it so it's not overly matte. For reference I am 42 years okd and alternate daily between Guerlain Le Teint Glow and Dior Glow. This is a FABULOUS addition to my makeup routine. Love love love. * This product was recommended by the Ulta sales associate.  It goes on very smooth, but somehow feels a little sticky all day.  It's easy to apply too much,  so it doesn't blur lines well.  The color recommended is too light, it doesn't cover blemishes well.  Disappointed. * I would definitely buy this product again. It's very light, not heavy at all, and very natural. * I went in to buy a darker color in Estée Lauder double wear. The sales lady talked me into buying this instead and I'm disappointed. It's not as long wearing and much easier to wipe off. It doesn't settle into wrinkles as bad. * I finally found a foundation that doesn't accentuate the wrinkles on my face. It's light and smooth, and still covers my face naturally. I have been using this product for years. Very happy with my results."

However, even on bad application days, a couple hours later I'm always amazed by how amazing my skin looks. * This goes on light and smooth. Gives nice coverage when you want to look natural. Has SPF 30. * I needed a replacement for my favorite Les Beiges tinted SPF moisturizer by Chanel, which was discontinued :(. An ULTA assistant pointed me in the direction of Laura Mercier's tinted moisturizer with SPF, which has been great (I'm on my third tube—each has lasted me about 9 months with daily use). I like how this product lightly balances out redness, gives a subtle glow, doesn't bother my skin, and is breathable. * I'm very picky when it comes to base makeup. I have dry/normal skin, a light-medium olive skintone, and I deal with dullness/discoloration. Shade 2N1 is a good shade match for me. I've enjoyed using this with a dense foundation brush. It's easy to sheer out or build up. I would describe it as light/medium coverage. It evens out my skin tone, but doesn't cover blemishes. Its very comfortable on the skin, it feels like a moisturizer, the consistency is thick at first, but it doesn't feel like anything when blended out. I can wear it without powder and it stays on all day for me. Definitely repurchasing. * I've been using this product for years!  I don't like thick heavy coverage so this is very light buildable coverage.  I have pretty good skin, 38 years old, cheeks are pink from dryness with few blemishes and this provides me full coverage.  I do add a thin layer of moisturizer (especially now that I'm older and less oily) and concealer for under my eyes, nose and any glaring blemishes.  It's a very natural finish that does pull warm.  I use 2N1 for my winter everyday color and 2W1 for summer when I'm tanned (it's very yellow/gold). * The Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer goes on nicely,  bur doesnt cover ANY imperfections. Some pilling.  I was hoping to love it, but will be returning it."

Now that I am 46 years old, I am looking for a foundation that is not so thick and heavy. I really like how light the foundation feels and leaves a dewy look... but I'm still not sold on the coverage. I don't know if it's because I'm used to such full coverage or if it's because my skin tone is not matching right? I like it.. I'm just not sure if I LOVE it. My favorite part of this bottle.. is being able to turn to keep it from accidentally leaking and easy to keep clean! * I'm on camera for my job and I needed something to cover up the hyperpigmentation and blemishes on my face. I was wearing the just Mac concealer because my past experiences with other brand foundations just never worked out (like I'd buy them and return immediately bc they looked terrible). This foundation changed all of that. It's a beautiful finish and goes on seamlessly. People don't know I'm wearing makeup, which I love. Many ask me my skincare routine and I silently laugh to my self bc if they only knew lol But YES, give it a try. You'll love it! * Makes skin look amazing * This foundation has incredible coverage without looking unnatural. With only 1 pump, my uneven skin tone and redness disappear. On camera and at the end of the day, my skin looks just as flawless as when I first applied it. * If you have dry skin or mature, dry skin, this is an absolute mess. It goes on Everett. Leslie gives you a glow without looking like your radiant and is so soft on your skin. I absolutely love it, and I pair it with my radiant concealer for an absolutely stunning look. * I love this foundation,  I have been using this for a few years. it goes on smooth, makes your skin light and silky.

It's pricey, so I'd recommend it mainly as a splurge. * Love Love Love This Foundation!!! I get so many compliments on my skin and it looks like Im not even wearing foundation. It's light and smells great. Last All day too!! * I have been using this foundation for about 6 months and i will keep rebuying. Its full covergae but looks skin like. Lasts 12 plus hours. I alwasy get compliments when u wear it. My only suggestion is trying it on in store i got the wrong shade at first. Highly recommended * Whelp, took the plunge, used some reward points, and waaaay better than anticipated. Excellent buildable coverage, matte finish. Have been using Laura Mercier and Urban Decay; Chanel wins for longevity on the skin (using finishing spray, UD). * It seems they've reformulated the product. The same shade color doesnt maych me anymore and its not as smooth finish either. What is going on ? * I really wanted to like this foundation, when I tried it on in the store, it felt so smooth and light, never settled in my laugh lines and it also covered my blemishes well. However, I have now tried a few of them in store and at home, and none of these shade fit my skin tone! It also oxidizes within an hour of wearing it. Ugh this foundation was exactly what I have been searching for but if I can't color match it and it changes colors throughout the day then it's just not a good fit. I feel terrible for returning it."

It was somewhat watery but I could not get it to spread on my face-i don't think I've ever had that happen with a foundation.  I wish I could give it 0 stars. * Looks very nice on * The best!"
54,lancÃ´me,teint idÃ´le ultra wear foundation stick,pimprod2023126,2577700," * Glides on smoothly and blends perfectly.  So easy to use! * I love this makeup stick. Goes on very smooth. * I used to love this product, before I ran out, I'd always buy another.
They definitely had changed the ingredients.
Before it was smooth, very pigmented and very moisturized where you could really blend it out onto skin and give you a glow look.
Now, it is very dry stick, the moment you smear it it dries instantly in that spot and you cannot blend it, if you do it just wipes away off your skin. I even use moisturizing face lotion before I apply this product and it doesn't really help at all compared to no lotion on the skin. No lotion on the skin is slightly worse, but there's barely a difference.
It also looks cakey because it's such a dry foundation stick. It doesn't not cakey like it did before if that makes sense. I wanted everyone to be aware so they didn't spend 55 or $55+ dollars for this product that's now junk due to change in ingredients. I will be trying the nude stick or something else that works like this use to; starting to explore other brand products in replace to this one. I am sad. This use to be my favorite go to product where it use to be worth the price, not anymore. * Excellent product-Lancôme, Excellent knowledgeable staff at the store! * I am 42 and in menopause due to a complete hysterectomy (sorry TMI). I have tried various primers, powders, and foundations, but this is the best long wear foundation I have tried. The coverage is great, it doesn't feel heavy, and despite sweating it stays put.  Try it, you won't be disappointed. * Convienent to use and lasts. I gave it 4 stars because I found it to be drying on my skin, even after skin prep (including a hydrating primer). I also feel that it sits on top of my skin but does not grip to my skin the way the Ilia stick does for me, so it does not look ""natural"". * I struggle with acne and skin picking always have possibly always will lol.. this little thing is amazing to keep in your bag for touchups. I love the concealer from this line and this foundation stick rocks. Full coverage- i just applied to a blemish (red, patchy, noticeable) and then davbed lightly with the brush on the other end and it blended perfectly, hid it conpletely. The brush is meant to blot not swipe. Just light pats on top of the makeup. I love it."
55,lancÃ´me,teint idole ultra wear care and glow foundation,pimprod2033657,2598637," * I had been using the original ultra wear formula and they were out of stock in my shade. One of the sales associates there helped me determine my shade in this line and I absolutely love it! It's got great build able coverage and actually feels hydrating * Finding foundating that gives me the coverage i need, this finish I want, and the wear I expect has always been a huge challenge for me (especially because i have craniofacial hyperbidrosis and very dry skin). This could maybe be a but more hydrating, but then it would probably just make me sweat more in tbe summer. Sometimes it wears oddly on me, but that's my experience with 99% of all foundations. My biggest issue is the comor range. I don't think I'm all that pale but the lightest shades are a slightlh too dark for me. And I have to mix the two lightest to try to match my warmish-neutral undertone. Wish they had a shade 100N. * I was using another cosmetic product! Now I only use Lancôme! 
One only problem I had when I when to Ulta, was the cashier! I will only use the gift card my son gives me, and I don't see my self coming back at this store * I absolutely love the coverage and blendability of this makeup.  It's the best I've found, just wish it wasn't so expensive. * I tried this on in store first and then went home and bought it online. I didn't realize it had a fragrance because I was in Ulta originally trying on various foundations. Being on my nose I couldn't help but smell it all day and I'm sensitive to certain fragrances because they tend to give me a headache. Return. * I tried other brands, but always come back to Lancôme. I tried this one because my normal coverage wasn't available and I loved it. The shade and coverage are perfect for me. * Absolutely love this foundation and it lasts a long time without separating on skin! Feels light but full coverage"
56,about-face,the performer skin-focused foundation,pimprod2043010,2618950," * I have such a hard time finding a shade match and I finally found a budget friendly one! Super exciting, but since adding it to my routine (which doesnt change often) Ive started breaking out all over my face. * As someone with fair olive skin, I've never been able to find a foundation that doesn't look orange or pink on me! This is the closest shade match I've ever seen. It has a natural and hydrating finish that I love too. * This foundation is worth the hype. For reference I have combination (mostly dry) skin and I always have trouble with foundation shades being too yellow on me. This foundation met all my hopes and dreams. It feels light on the skin, provides beautiful medium coverage and looks gorgeous on. I wanna buy a million bottles so my friends and family have one. I hope Halsey knows how great her products are, because I want this foundation to stick around for a very long time. * I wanted to like this foundation so much. My go to favorite is Nars light reflecting & when I saw that this foundation was also heavily skincare based, had a great shade range and was half the price, I was hopeful! I have larger pores on my cheeks and nose,  I tried applying with a brush, a sponge, my fingers, with skin care, without skincare, even as far as trying to go without a particular skincare step (thinking maybe its just one of the products) but I just couldnt get it to not look like it was filling my pores and leaving little white spots in those areas. It also clung to any dry spots I had. You have to be very careful when pulling the applicator out of the component, otherwise you fling product. * Gives coverage but not heavy * I love the coverage of this foundation and its literally my perfect shade! It also pairs great with the concealer and lasts all day! * The foundation is average. I'd prefer it didn't have the brush, since it doesn't make sense to apply foundation with a brush like that. I was also disappointed that LM2O isn't olive at all--it definitely has a lot of orange in it. My search continues!"
57,charlotte tilbury,charlotte's beautiful skin foundation,pimprod2043365,2619495," * My skin is super dry and I was seeking a foundation to help with hydration. It lives up to the claims. Flawless finish. * This foundation feels more like a skin care product. Very light coverage leaving an overall oily look. Looks terrible with other products applied and will easily pill. This is not made for a full face makeup look. I got the shades #4 and #5 and the foundation itself is separating in the bottle! So disappointing. * Had such high expectations for this. Tried it over several days with different moisturizers underneath. The thick, chunky consistency did not work for my somewhat dry 56 yr old skin. Sad. * For reference I used Doublewear for 15+ years, moved to IT CC Cream (still enjoy sometimes) and now use Charlotte's Beautiful Skin (approx. 1.5 to 2 years) -- I'm amazed at the negative reviews!  If your foundation is separating, color seems off or it's too runny,  SHAKE IT!  This is a liquid squeeze bottle, full of skincare + foundation -- if it's not been used in a while, shaking it will return it to it's intended form.  This foundation is perfect for dry or imperfect skin -- my face ALWAYS looks better with it!  Slightly less coverage than IT CC, this one is more of a ""your skin at it's very best"" -- it gives a perfect even skin, little to no pores look, whole being a bit more dewy than others.  I think it looks best blended out with fingertips -- if you like more coverage add a little concelear (Haus Labs works GREAT in conjunction)! * I was recommended this foundation for drier skin! I love it. It's gives your skin a healthy glow! * I'm very impressed with this foundation. I don't usually branch off to try other brands except my  forever No. 1 NARS, but I have to say Charlotte's Beautiful Skin Foundation keeps my skins supple and moist with this frigid dry NY winter air. I don't have any headaches when wearing it through my 8+ hour shift at work, it blends well and gives me a nice glow. 

It's not going to beat my number one, but it's made it on my team in the rotation. * Very natural, yet covering. After the first time I used it, I was asked what I was doing with my skin.  I love it!"
58,dior,dior forever foundation fluid matte,pimprod2036825,2604875," * I would give it 5 stars if it wasnt for the pump * I'm obsessed with this Dior foundation. It performs beautifully on my oily/combo skin  it stays matte in all the right places while still looking natural. The coverage is amazing and easily buildable, and it lasts all day without separating. Highly recommend if you want something long-wearing and flawless! * I've tried many foundations and this one is by far the best. 
You get coverage but it looks so natural on and stays all day. * might try to mix with another foundation * Beautiful coverage and the first foundation I've found that actually conceals large pores. 
Don't be fooled by the name matte, it's actually a very hydrating formula.  Great for mature skin. * Nice coverage would prefer no scent due to the added ingredients. * My favorite foundation. I've repurchased many times because I like the light weight formula and full coverage. It also has a pleasant smell thats not overpowering. I have oily skin and this keeps me nice and matte."

60,clinique,acne solutions liquid makeup foundation,pimprod2043524,2619813," * I needed a new foundation and was willing to try a new product. This has been the worst foundation I've ever used. I love a very light coverage of a skin tint, but this is very patchy. I find it very hard to blend with a brush or beauty blender, I don't know how else to fix it other than to return and find a new product. * This is the best foundation I have ever used. I've been using it for years and I love the beautiful finish. Don't let the fact that it's focused on acne keep you from trying it either. Does not try out my skin in the least. Highly recommend! * I cant speak to acne prevention as Ive only used this product for 3 days. I can say, Ive had the hardest time applying this foundation. It always turns out patchy no matter how much I blend and it seems to dry a darker color than when applied? It emphasizes any texture on your skin (dry patches) and looks cakey & flaky. * Clinique recommended this when they discontinued their Stay Matte foundation, but it's been a terrible substitute. Despite the product name, it makes my skin breakout way more than it did with Stay Matte, and there's no oil or shine control. * I absolutely love this foundation. Blends super super well with any other product, or is perfect by itself. ONLY complaint is that it will (sometimes) cling to dry patches if your primer wasnt dense enough there. Other then that, its perfect. * It does not break me out. My dermatologist said it was good for me to use. Offers moderate coverage without a heavy feel. I had the consultant at the clinque counter help me match my skin tone with was very helful. * I have been using this  for 25 yrs. Same color just ordered and upon application, it is a completely different shade- much darker and turns orange.
PLEASE bring back old formula or figure out same shade. I even tried to match with a new color and none of them match."

A little small, but nonetheless it's worth the cost if you're looking for great coverage and light feel on the skin. * I absolutely love this foundation it's so light, byt yet has such good coverage! * Had someone help me in store with shade and it was mt exact match, while I do love the coverage and how long it lasts, the shade oxidized and now it looks dark 🥲 * I'm loving this stick foundation. It blends beautifully and offers solid coverage without being heavy, which I appreciate since I'm comfortable showing my natural imperfections. I even use it on my eyelids as a primer, and it performs wonderfully. * i love this foundation! its so smooth & looks like it melts into your skin. ive used a brush & sponge with it & love both.
note: all fenty face products tend to oxidize on the warmer side; wouldnt recommend if youre cool toned * I live this for my no make up make up days because it light weight and melts into the skin. Its also prettu transer proof considering it is cream-based. * I have a super fair complexion and so many things oxidize and turn orangey on me, but this stays the perfect cool toned shade. Its such a smooth natural finish!! No caking or separating"
62,fenty beauty by rihanna,soft'lit naturally luminous hydrating longwear foundation,pimprod2045514,2624152," * Very satisfied * I got shade 100 as a pale neutral girly, and it dries SOO orange. Almost as bad as the NARS Light Reflecting foundation. HOWEVER, using a 3 pumps of white mixing pigment... I get a perfect shade match! It's full coverage, gives an almost nice dewy finish, and is long lasting! I've repurchased this twice and have never had any problems :) * I was a 240 in the original hydrating foundation that was discontinued and it was a perfect match. With this new foundation, 240 pulls a bit neutral which my skintone does not like. I then tried a 235, and it is way too yellow… I am very disappointed, I really wanted this to work for me, especially with the price point. * Favorite foundation! The pigment doesn't settle into finelines and it leaves your slin very hydrated + a rlly good shade range * I love how full coverage and dewy this one was. And i do have normal/dry skin and this was perfect for me however i do suggest finding your color match in person but overall i love this foundation and would definitely recommend trying this one out. * I am a rookie with make up and finding a shade in this brand was so easy for me! It is absolutely perfect. My skin is fair to light with lots of pink. I chose 170(cool pink), though 150(neutral) was a close choice as well * went over the reviews and saw someone else with dey skin writing an essay 😂. Anyways same thing happened to me. Annoying bc its supposed to be ""hydrating""."
63,hourglass,veil hydrating skin tint,pimprod2040571,2611435," * Leaves my skin feeling extremely greasy and sticky. I will not ever be buying this again… I've tried using it alone and with my regular primer and moisturizer and no matter how I use it I feel greasy and it rubs off onto EVERYTHING. You would think in the dry West Texas weather where everyones skin dries out with everything it would be great hut ko it just gets more greasy feeling as the day goes on * I'm 37, and have given up on foundation, it just makes me look older than I am. I've been on the hunt for the perfect skin tint (Ilia, Live Tinted, drug store etc.), but this is a 10/10. I have normal to dry skin, and fine lines/large pores. This makes my skin look amazing. Truly your skin, but better. Even at 10x magnification you can't see this on the skin. I set it with a little powder and it lasts 8+ hours without settling into my fines lines. It's very easy to apply, I just blend it out with my fingers. I even use this under my eyes instead of concealer. The coverage of this is sheer to light. It's perfect for the no-makeup look, my skin looks naturally beautiful with this. This is never heavy or cakey, it really just feels like a moisturizer. This is a keeper! * Love it * AMAZING wonderful, beautiful, flattering, best ever for dry skin! I don't understand the negative reviews. 

Product looks extremely pigmented when squeezed out of the tube: I get good medium coverage on my face, like a true makeup foundation, not at all like a tinted moisturizer, nor like a BB cream (maybe after 8 hours it has faded a bit -- an extremely EVEN, flattering fade, I might add -- to perhaps light-medium coverage around the 7th to 9th hour...?). 

So: my facial skin is aged, so dry it comes off in flakes, it has several deep lines & lots of medium-deep wrinkles, lots of medium & fine lines, can get clogged pores, have some visible pores on my nose, very dark circles, uneven color everywhere and darker color patches on chin, occasional red blemish. Every single makeup except this causes to my dryness to worsen, skin cracking, just so bad I had given up on wearing makeup (except when very needed, only a few hours). The one product I use sometimes is Hourglass ""Vanish"" (a stick foundation), but it is heavy & needed lots of moisturizing primer; it was visually a great color match but still I'd get some caking and dry patches late in the day with Vanish stick product. So I went to Ulta with my Vanish stick foundation (they don't sell it at Ulta) and the associate found a corresponding Moisture Veil color and sent me home with a sample. I stupidly let it sit on the counter for 6 weeks (wish I had started using it earlier!!); prior to a recent event, I tried it out. 

Oh My Gosh!! Moisture Veil is AMAZING. So pigmented. Beautiful looking on my face. Applied easily, blended out so nicely (just with my fingers). I had forgotten primer & it was not problem: very even application. My skin felt extremely comforted, nourished, very moisturized all day long. Product did not at initial application settle in my wrinkles, and, I am shocked, did not do settle into my lines all day long even at the 8th, 9th, 10th hour of wear. 

No clinging to dry patches (in fact, my dry patches kind of disappeared with Moisture Veil), no cracking, no cakey-ness whatsoever. I looked about 10, maybe 15 years younger, and also like I'd had a really good night's sleep. 

I did dab on top of the product a very small amount of my Hourglass Vanish stick foundation (it can also be used as a concealer) under my eyes and on one small blemish-caused discoloration (so I wasn't concerned if the Veil did not cover my dark circles). The Vanish ""played nice"" with Moisture Veil (which was surprising, because usually Vanish needs a really slippery primer to blend: but it blended easily with the Moisture Veil under it). So now I wear Moisture Veil daily. 

The Moisture Veil has a very nice finish: it is not shiny at all, yet not super flat/matte. It has no shimmer at all (shimmer/glitter/""glow"" imo is a problem for really aged, wrinkly skin like mine). The finish is very natural, healthy, very pretty, like real skin that has always been ""you have such good skin."" 

It does a great job evening out my skin tone / discoloration. It makes my pores disappear except for a small area area with bigger pores (and those pores look much, much smaller and far less noticeable with Veil). I have not noticed transferring (but I am not rubbing my face on things during the day, so idk) and it definitely stays in place on my face and does not at all slide around. 

I am not using primer and not using setting powder, but it lasts fine for 6 - 7 hours no fading, medium coverage; then another 3 - 6 hours hours (hours 8-12) it is still there but has faded to lighter coverage but color remains true to what it should be and it is still very even coverage, and still not dry patches. This is very good longevity for me!  

Improved skin health: since I have been wearing it daily my skin's extreme dryness has been healing, even at night when I'm not wearing Veil, it's like I have different skin. My skin tone also seems to have become more even (when I am not even wearing Veil) since I started using it. I also have not broken out nor gotten any increase in my mild clogged pores situation since I began wearing Veil every day. 

I hope that Hourglass keeps making Moisture Veil forever! I love this foundation so much!! If you have very dry skin, try it out! * I had purchased this along with the Hourglass Vanish Pressed Powder. It didn't matter what primer, mositruizer, etc. it would still cling onto dry patches and peel off my face. I tried applying it with zero product on, and still had the same effect. The Milk Skin Tint is so much better, and cheaper. Really was disappointed. * Today is my second full day of wear but i really enjoy this skin tint. It looks so natural on my skin without feeling heavy or oily. I have a dry skin type and this does not let that dryness show. Usually i start to feel my makeup by the end of the day after settles but I have not had that b problem with this * I have very dry skin and have been trying to find the perfect skin tint that won't feel heavy on my skin and provide a beautiful glow. Unfortunately, this one was not it for me. Even with skin prep and moisturizer it emphasized my smile lines and the finish on this was not as glowy as I would have hoped for."
64,morphe,filter effect soft-focus foundation,pimprod2022516,2577758," * This is a nice foundation, I like it but the top just falls off.  It doesn't stay on if I want to travel with it in my makeup bag, and I've dropped the bottle by picking it up by its 2.5""lid several times.   Packaging needs work.   I'd only refer it to a friend with the warning about poor ability to close it and keep the pump sanitary. * I liked this foundation a lot! It matched my skin tone really well, and is a really affordable price. It's a nice size, and usually lasts me over four months to finish. The only bad thing is that it takes a while to blend in and I find myself having to go over it with a beauty blender or brush a lot. I do still really like it though and it covers up many imperfections. * The best foundation ever!!!!!! * Patchy, greasy , I was disappointed ☹️ * Great price so, I thought to give it a try. It's not a bad foundation but not one that squeals excitement. Blends pretty well but after a while it seems to pool into lines and makes imperfections noticeable. Would probably be a good product for dry skin * I like how it blends out and has the perfect coverage for everyday use. * I like how it blends out and has the perfect coverage for everyday use."
65,urban decay,face bond self-setting waterproof foundation,pimprod2044818,2623593," * I would buy this product again and again! The Face Bond Self-Setting Waterproof Foundation is honestly one of the best foundations I've ever used. The coverage is excellent - it evens out my skin tone perfectly without feeling heavy or cakey. I love that it's self-setting, so I don't need to use extra powder, and it stays in place all day.
It feels lightweight on the skin, looks very natural, and really is waterproof. Even after a long day, my makeup still looks fresh and smooth.
If you're looking for a long-lasting, comfortable foundation with great coverage, I highly recommend this one! * I had loved how this foundation looked on skin. Very smooth and lasted all day easily. Minimizing my texture and pores. It sat so pretty. The reason why I have to remove a star and can't continue to use this makeup is due to burning skin reaction I got at work in the middle of the day. My skin literally started to itch and burn on the cheeks. I had to run to drugstore to buy makeup wipes. Please stop adding Niacinamide to foundation, Face Bond has 3% Niacinamide and most skincare has it too. Most makeup has it now when it sensitizes people's skin. Niacinamide is added in skincare and makeup is being advertised as skin care with over saturation of these active ingredients in everything now, it does not belong in foundation. Let customers decide their skincare routines. Also the fact this Face Bond has so much alcohol by day 3 of using this my skin literally screamed. But the makeup does look beautiful just the ingredients need to be better. Its half off i wonder if this is being phased out now. * With acne orobe skin, it is difficult to find a foundation. Howevr, face bibd has not caused any new breakouts. In fact, it is great with oil control, full coverage, and minimizing pores. It looks very natural without being cakey. The only warning is a hydrating lotion is needed uf uou have acne combo skin. * Color was way darker than the shade on the web, need a couple shades lighter but will consider purchasing again * I had been waiting a long time to try this and SO GLAD I did. Skin match is impeccable. Coverage is perfect for me. My only complaint is the size is so small. * This would be a nice product, just not for me.  Sits a little Cakey on my face, tried a couple different primers.  Just not meant for my skin type.  Lasts all day, and color match is pretty spot on….so I gave it three stars * After years of searching for a replacement for Hourglass Immaculate which was discontinued, I have finally found the one! Face Bond has beautiful coverage, is long lasting and does down nicely. Great for oily girls. Highly recommend!"
66,jane iredale,purepressed base mineral foundation refill,pimprod2033383,2595091," * This powder looks nice at first, but after about two hours my entire face got soo oily. The powder clings to every imperfection on my face and emphasizes them, so by the end of the day I look horrible. I tried applying it lightly with a brush and I also tried patting it into my t-zone (that made things worse). I'm debating trying it with an oily skin primer to give it another chance, because the shade match is perfect and I don't feel like going to return it. I imagine this could work better if you have drier, blemish free skin, or even as a setting powder on top of foundation, but as an oily skin girly, its a no from me. * I recently switched to a CC cream instead of foundation and I love it, but I needed something to set it with as it is pretty shiny. I tried a setting powder but didn't love it and decided to try this instead since I have several other Jane Iredale products that I love. This powder foundation has quickly become my new favorite! It applies beautifully and literally looks the exact same at 6 PM as it did at 6 AM. I chose the color radiant and it could not match my skin any better than it does. I am so thrilled with it, I am tempted to buy a few more so I never run out. Please never discontinue this or change it, it is perfect!!! * This foundation is a glitter bomb. After application it looked like I was park of the Cullen family. It accentuated all of my pores and did NOT keep my oils at bay. Terrible. Immediately returned. * This tops any other foundation or skin tint I have tried before (and that list is very long). This looks like your skin if it was perfectly even and plump. Does not settle into file lines and lasts sooo long on even without touch ups. Love the good ingredients and feel good about what I'm putting on my skin. I have gotten so many compliments since I started wearing it. Shade range is great too. Literally the best for reactive/sensitive skin. * This mineral foundation is my favorite and the only one I use. Liquid foundations just roll off my face. This foundation stays in place and gives me enough coverage. You can dust it on lightly or keep applying for more coverage. * I have been using this for almost 25 years, nothing can beat it. It was originally created by a plastic surgeon for her patients after surgery at her practice. Then it made it's way to estheticians and finally retail.  The coverage is fantastic. I live in Florida's heat and humidity and it stands up to it perfectly. I personally believe the sunscreen has helped me to keep the sun damage at bay as well. I saw a review that said it had sparkles. I have never seen that in all this time. Perhaps it was confused with the BM label??? I use the Real Techniques powder sponge (the one thats super light and airy) as it does not come with an applicator. Also it does not come in a compact. My suggestion is to try it and then purchase theirs after you fall in love with it or decide it is not for you. I have had my current compact for about 6 years and it is easy to pop in the next refill. There is a little hole in the back that is about the size of a paper clip tip and you can just push it out. There is a magnet that holds it in place. It really does save on throwing everything in a landfill. It finishes beautifully with PS On Till Dawn setting spray. I will say that as my skin has ""matured"" I do not try to use as much as my skin is drying up. BTW i use it as a setting powder , hence the trying to back off some as i have aged, but it is great as just a foundation too. Hope this review helps. This stuff is like a secret miracle. (I dont work for them. My friend was an esthetician and turned me on to it as I am a long time makeup fan) * It doesn't say that the product has sparkles - I don't do sparkles on foundation, it looks childish. Also, the finish is not ""skin-like"" but very mate. That's a no for me."
67,dior,dior forever fluid skin glow foundation,pimprod2036824,2605019," * I personally was not able to enjoy this product. I think it goes on beautifully and works for many people. However, if you have very sensitive skin like me, it might make you break out. I did a patch test and had a reaction to it. I was aware there was fragrance in it, however it was much more than anticipated. * Literally kicking myself for not trying skin glow sooner. Finish comparable to haus labs. Rivals the Dior skin perfect stick (my fav). Honestly puts Armani to shame. No cling to dry patches. Makes me want to cry how due to how pretty it is. lol * This foundation has a nice finish on my skin but it settles in every little line on my face, very disappointed. * 3rd time buying this. It blends perfectly, covers my fine lines, even my '11' line BUT BETTER THAN THAT- it covers my heavy rosacea on my cheeks. Love this product! * I love this product. It makes my face looks flawless and glowing,  I will recommend it to my friends * The foundation matches my skin tone perfectly. I was using another foundation before but found it very shear. This one covers but is not thick or caked on. It also has a nice scent to it. * The Dior Forever Foundation is absolutely amazing. It applies beautifully, evens out the skin tone, doesn't emphasize pores, and lasts all day without looking cakey. The skin looks fresh, smooth, and natural. It feels very comfortable on the skin and doesn't dry it out.
I'm very happy with the result — this is definitely a foundation I'll keep using and highly recommend."

The formula seems nice. But I can not fix the shade once it is on my face. There are better options out there. * I've been using shade 100N for years and now it's gone. I tried the lightest shades 120 and 130 but they both turned orange once I smoothed it on. The liquid also seems much more watery and is definitely not medium coverage anymore. I really liked it before :( * I tried this product on a black friday sale and let me just say, i'm highly disappointed.
The palest shade was too dark and orangey and it was so cakey and felt so uncomfortable on. Looked terrible. * I've been using this foundation for 5 years and its always gone on quite nicely. I like the variety of colors offered. I'm pretty pale with cool undertones so its haed to me to find products that dont either wash me out or make me look orange. But the most recent bottle I bought is not only much more watery than usual, bht also has a MUCH warmer tone thay makes me look yellow-y. Still a decent and usuable product so i will get through the bottle, but im disappointed that i will have to find a new foundation. * I LOVE this foundation!! Goes on so smoothly and definitely gives a soft natural look even with it being almost to full coverage. We just need more lighter shades! Unfortunately 120N being the lightest shade its still warm for me so its the perfect summer shade, but we need something lighter for us very pale girlies in the winter. * This foundation is absolutely gorgeous with a perfect in-between finish. Unfortunately, they only have a shade for when I have self-tanner on -- it looks like 110C would have been a perfect natural match, but it was discontinued. Bummer!"
69,tarte,babassu foundcealer dewy foundation spf 20,pimprod2006408,2542892," * If you're acne prone, or have sensitive skin, this is NOT the foundation for you, I'm sorry. This broke me out SO badly, it was like I was a teen again. But I see sunflower seed oil in the ingredient list, & yep, there's the problem. I know some are fine with this oil, but I do not have sensitive skin at all, & my skin was at its worst in my life using this foundation alone. Tried it 3x to be sure. Yep, it's THIS. And it's the kind of acne that is deep cystic, painful, that you know dang well was caused by some oil (think castor, mineral or olive oil like.) Avoid like the plague if you love your skin, & want to try to retain a more texture/scar free surface. I'm a mess rn; thank you Mario Badescu for your magic healing (blemish repairing) powder. It saved my face from this...ungodly creation. BTW, I love Tarte products, & use them every day. I just cannot use THIS. Maybe it's an allergy, I dunno. But It didn't last more than 1 hour on my face, it just slid around like an oil slick, & transferred onto everything I love mercilessly. Was 100% worn off in less than 1 hour. Like I had applied nothing. And I'm a full coverage, really get it on there, kinda gal, lol. Coverage was great for almost 60min, then it was literally zero. I would not pay the amount they are asking for this, nor let it touch my skin again. Returned it. If you want fulllll coverage, long lasting - try Tarte's Face Tape full coverage foundation. You cannot go wrong!! So many shades too. 22B here. That color seems to sell out first, as so many of us ae fair-to-light skin with cool pink undertones. If you're on the fence between the two, def go Face Tape! ;-) * Why use sunflower seed oil?? This breaks me out in full face acne. Upon first application, I had acne on every square inch of my face (no joke). And I do not have acne prone nor sensitive skin at all. But this 1 stupid ingredient, sunflower seed oil, does it every time. WHY USE IT?? My skin ITCHED so bad I couldn't wait to get it off my face. This is also very short-wear makeup. Lasts 2-4hrs MAX. Face was incredibly patchy after 2-4 hours, no foundation at all left on it. Just melted off, in full oily like fashion. And it was set with powder & Elf setting spray after application!! I also used a primer under, & properly moisturized 1st. This is just not in line with my requirements for a foundation. Returning it. (None of my other foundations have this acne causing ingredient, sunflower seed oil; hi end or drug store.) WHY use this oil guys?? * It does have amazing coverage and it CAN last all day. It was great in the summer when my skin wouldnt get as oily or need as much moisturizer under my makeup. This winter it was caking and creasing into every line and pore and it just wouldn't lay right. Glad i tried it but probably wont buy again. * This slipped and slide all over my skin and sunk into my fine lines. * I got a travel-size sample of this foundation a while back, but almost didn't bother with it. SO GLAD I did. I am so very hard to match and this is as perfect a match I've had since Revlon discontinued the foundation I used to wear over a decade ago. The shade range is great, the foundation is thin-ish but NOT watery. Yet the pigmentation is medium-high. I recommend it. * I have been going back to this product faithfully over the last few years. The coverage is great and it leaves your skin radiant with a natural looking glow. * I've used this for many years on my mature (aka old!) skin. Recently bought a bottle of foundation at a department store , used it less than a week, threw it out & went to Ulta for Tarte Foundcealer! Will never change."

Lasts the majority of the day with little wear. My skin looks great when I have it on! * Loved the formula, finish and coverage on this product!  So sad they will discontinue 😭 * My heart is breaking knowing this product will be discontinued. This was litterally the best skin tint i ever owned * This is the best tinted moisturizer I have tried! I have combination skin so my skin is very particular about what products I use. I am distraught knowing that this will be discontinued 😭😭 * I have oily skin and this does not work well with it. Also, I don't understand why when I apply, it's like clumps up. Even when others have said you can layer other products with it. I have applied of fresh clean skin and after applying, it would rub off in clumps if I rubbed too much. * I love this product so much, ive been using it for a year. I never been a fan of thick foundation and this product has saved me from looking cakey. I love by itself and when i do a full face of makeup. * You would think this being advertised as clean ingredient based that it wouldnt break you out and the niacinamide would be a great additive to this. But no.. i wore it one time 3 days ago and woke up today with 4 pustils and 1 cystic blemish!"
71,mac,studio fix fluid spf15 24hr matte foundation + oil control,pimprod2044825,2622175," * I used to love this stuff so much. I went and bought my 3rd one a couple months ago but only recently opened it and I dont know if i got a bad batch or if the formula changed but i HATE it! It creased so bad, dried my skin out and made me look dry and dull. I thought maybe my skin was just dry so I did some hardcore prep beforehand and still nope. Unfortunately its been 3 months so I cant return this expensive foundation. I have since switched products. Im sad cause i loved this before but i cant just waste money on this stuff if its going to crease, dry me out and accentuate my pores 10x more than no makeup does… :( * I would buy over and over * . * They should have never changed the formula. The new colors and formulation are terrible. I used to be NW10 but the new one is nothing like the OG. Returning asap * I am light skinned but have a warm undertone and olive skin and when I went to the store the make artist recommended me NC17. I am not a fan of it because it leaves a visible layer on your skin and looks unnatural. It gives you that dried out look.. * Im very satisfied with my products 
I brought a friend with me that day and the girls tried the foundation in each one of bus and we love it and buy it
In the future I will bring more friends with me and yes I will love to continue buying this product * This foundation is truly unmatched. The finish, coverage, oil control, and wear time are perfection. Even in humid Houston weather!! It looks flawless on the skin all day without caking, separating, or breaking down, even on oily skin. It photographs beautifully and somehow still looks natural in person. I've tried countless foundations at every price point and always come back to this one. PLEASE never change this formula, it is absolute gold and a staple that outperforms everything else on the market."
72,l'orÃ©al,infallible 24h fresh wear foundation in a powder,pimprod2021871,2575170," * Breaks every single tome. Super fragile * This is a tried and true product I have used and loved for YEARS!

However, I am so disappointed in this product as of lately. I have ended up buying several due to the fact that the pressed powder breaks up and crumbles after a few uses. It then gets super messy and does not apply well. Super bummed that Loreal clearly has made some formula changes that impact the quality of what was once an amazing product. * I would give this powder 5 stars if only it didn't brake so easily but other than that issue it's actually pretty good but if you have extremely dry skin I wouldn't recommend because it can be a little drying. * This powder is not the best, and for the price, it's quite expensive. I haven't used it for a full month, and it already broke apart in the packaging. I don't think it's meant to be used with a brush because the powder disintegrates. When I used the puff, it applied nicely and provided full coverage, but it was too heavy on my skin and didn't look good under the light. It's a shame how much I spent; I should have gotten a higher-end brand. Personally, I like the Urban Decay All Nighter Powder, and I'll invest in that instead. * I used a toner, moisturizer, and spf and let that sit on the skin 15 mins before applying. I used a dense, flat top brush to blend the powder into my skin. It performs better than my dior, hourglass, and other loreal true match foundation! I am in love with the amount of coverage and how it makes my skin look. * Learning curb with this one! Didn't like it at first. The sponge applicator that comes with it is junk! Sits too much on the skin and doesn't blend in really brings out the pores!!! Then used with my makeup brush and it's much better! A little on the light side but blends much better! Stays put for the most part with some setting spray. * This powder comes in great shades for any skin tone. The powder is not too thick or too thin. It's just the right consistency and lasts me a few hours"
73,chanel,les beiges water-fresh tint,pimprod2030055,2574253," * Let me start by saying this is my first Chanel product purchase and I paid for this product with my own money. Although it's definitely on the pricier side, if your looking for a lightweight, natural, no make-makeup skin tint, this is IT! The consistency is weightless, glowy, and it blends like a dream! I am in love! I will hands down repurchase this product for years to come! Worth every cent! * Love this and use it as my new daily foundation. It matches your skin tone perfectly and goes on so light weight without highlighting any flaws like pores, etc. must use with a setting spray (I like Morphe) and use a brush for application. I also recommend a oil absorbent sheet after it dries to get the perfect base. * this is the best foundation I have ever purchased. It makes your skin look great. light coverage, but that's exactly what I was wanting.It dosent settle into fine lines and feels like you have nothing on. * Best invisible undetectable coverage product I've ever tried. * This is basically a tinted moisturizer fabulous but  light coverage. However, your skin will never look better! Super easy & quick to apply! I use my fingers spread like a serum. * I hate that I love it so much!! It is very light weight, with light coverage, perfect for summer and hot weather, it glides on so smoothly, you only need a little bit to cover all face. Definitely recommend giving it a go, will repurchasing when done with the bottle i have! * It took me a while to open up to this product. Once I started using it more, I already bought a back up! I l enjoy how it makes my skin look and my other products layer on top of it really well."
74,clinique,even better refresh hydrating and repairing makeup foundation,pimprod2004194,2541677," * I love this product and have used it for years.  Please dont discontinue this foundation.  I can't use the one with the SPF included because I'm allergic to sunscreen. 
Thank you * This foundation is such great quality and lasts all day and the best part is its good for your skin and helps wirh hyperpigmentation its so great ! * This is the foundation that me & my family all wear. Clinique has no other foundation with full coverage & a natural finish. I'm so bummed I'll have to find a foundation to use in a different brand. * Love this foundation for my combination skin. * I won't even allow this product to come near my face. It contains an astonishing TWELVE separate forms of silicone (including dimethicone as the 2nd ingredient, following water). This has more silicone than most silicone-based face primers, so if this is what you are seeking, just buy a cheap silicone-based primer and powder; I think you'd end up with a similar result. Even with all it's additives, it still lacks sunscreen (chemical or physical), although the thought of adding sunscreen to this already pore-stifling mixture makes my face sweat just thinking about it.

With a name like Clinique, we except you to formulate proceducts with skin-loving ingredients. Cosmetics companies can no longer get away with adding whatever cheap ingredients they wish in order to achieve the façade of temporarily healthy skin. Consumers have educated themselves and we know too much now.

Do better, Clinique. * Great product * I had high hopes for this foundation since it was described as for very dry mature skin.  Nope, too thick, wrong color choice (my mistake), no matter how lightly I applied it still caked in creases & wrinkles."
75,kvd beauty,good apple skin-perfecting hydrating foundation balm,pimprod2022990,2577085," * I received Good Apple Skin-Perfect Hydrating Foundation Balm as a gift, and since I was out of my usual foundation, I used it for a family event.  WOW.  I am a woman of a ""certain"" age (60), and I cannot tell you how many people stopped to compliment me on how beautiful my makeup looked!  I did nothing different except for my base.  I have continued to use the Balm ever since and I STILL get complimented on my makeup on a regular basis.  LOVE IT.  It doesn't settle into my fine lines and doesn't dry or cake.  It offers a wide variety of shades--so the match is pretty perfect.  Light to medium coverage, and it doesn't ""sweat off.""   HIGHLY recommend * I am not typically a cream foundation girl, but as I've gotten older, I'm trying different things. A little goes a long way and for me it gives me the coverage I need. Of course I'm trying this in the unseasonably cold winter here in Florida so its great! I will rate it again in the summer, hence the 4 stars. * I'm not typically a fan of cream foundations, but this one has shockingly worked for me. For reference, I have combination skin, very dry on the cheeks and tip of the nose and oily everywhere else. I initially tried applying this the way I saw it used in videos to and I hated the way it sat on my skin and separated throughout the day. I shelved it for a while and recently came back to it. I decided to go in lightly instead and just put an extremely thin layer. Let me tell you, THAT was the game changer. I  tapped my brush in lightly only two times and that was enough to cover my whole face. The coverage was still shockingly good, I'd say high medium coverage. I usually don't even use concealer with it! It dries down to a nice natural finish and feels so lightweight that I forget it's there. It does transfer a bit unless I powder and set it with a hefty dose of spray, but that's my only really complaint. It can crease a little bit around my smile lines halfway through the day when it's hot and humid, but I can tap a bit of powder or even just tap my finger across to even it back out and I'm good to go. It doesn't emphasize my texture and actually makes my skin look more smooth. It feels and looks so good and combines great coverage with a natural skin-like look that I really appreciate. I'm almost done with this compact and I'm hoping that the new owners of KVD don't shelve this formula!! * I purchased the tan 66, keep it in my purse for quick touch ups and it's excellent for my needs. I have mature skin and some foundation settles into lines I didn't even know I had, hence making me look older. This balm glides on, no creasing, and stays put. If desired for a night out, I add a little hourglass setting powder. I also like that it's hydrating, but clearly good products because I have had some that sting my eyes or have heavy fragrance that I literally had to take off in a public bathroom and throw the whole item in the trash.
I have been a cushion foundation type for decades, glad to see they have made a comeback. * I have worn this for several years and only recently atopped using it. I love the color choices and the coverage. However, it creases very quickly and very badly on my aged skin. I tried all sorts of primer to prevent the creasing and nothing worked. I also noticed that before I use it all….the color goes from being beautiful when first opened to giving me an orange look before it is all used up. I wear makeup every day so it doesn't get old enough that it should be doing that. It wastes about 1/4 of the product. It's a bit pricey to be having to throw that much away. If you are younger and have fewer lines, it mught work well for you. * I love the way it goes on. It covers but doesnt look cakey, it doesn't set in my lines on my face. It also matches my skin great. I have been having trouble getting it in stores. That would be my only complaint. * First of all i've had the hardest time finding a foundation that actually matches my skin tone which is like a medium, but with cool tones and that just doesn't exist, this matches me almost perfectly. Also all of my other foundations cause laugh lines and this one doesn't. It gives me such an airbrush look, and I do not need a primer with it. I have some discoloration from cystic acne, and it immediately covers it up. I don't even really need concealer. Overall, it's just a really great product."
76,chanel,les beiges healthy glow foundation hydration and longwear,pimprod2030080,2571508," * This foundation is the best.  It goes on creamy and blends evenly.  It matches my skin tone perfectly.  It's a little pricey but I don't mind the expense because of the results. Highly recommend. * I tried to like this and I just can't seem to make it work. It doesn't matter how much I prep my skin, this foundation will get crusty. I have even exfoliated and put it on, and nothing.  The fragrance is strong. Smells good but every strong for face. * Stop even looking at this foundation! It's terrible. Pilling, separating, everything. I bought new brushes, tried primers, tried sponges, with moisturizer, without moisturizer, literally everything and this is streaking and turns into a weird reptilian like crust on the face. I am a long time Chanel wearer, and won't be deviating from my no1 or le tint * I have a dry skin and was looking for hydrating and lightweight foundation. I have never had Channel foundation and had high hopes for this one. There were some pros: good color match and naturally looking, glowing, and  like second skin finish. However, the major downside - it was drying. I never skip hydrating skincare routine. Yet, the foundation was drying even with hydrating primer on top of prepped skin. So, I had to return. * I wouldn't ever use any other brand of Foundation! * Genuinely such a good foundation. So easy to work into the skin, leaves my skin glowy and fresh. * I have rocesea/sensative/reactive skin/oilyskin and have tried EVERY SINGLE foundation in the market. This does not irritate my skin, it doesnt break me out, it doesnt flare my skin. It does have the slightest floral scent which i was hesitant but my skin loved it!!! Goes on like the dream and it doesnt feel like i have a layer of makeup. It looks like your skin but better. Leave a natural glow nothing shimmery. I highly suggest to please try it. Yes a little expensive BUT it's definitely worth every penny. I will forever continue to purchase this foundation."

80,pÃ¼r,4-in-1 love your selfie longwear foundation & concealer,pimprod2005671,2544510," * After trying what feels like every foundation ever made I finally found PUR and I haven't looked back. The coverage is amazing and the finished look is so smooth and clean. I did read a few reviews talking about the finish and how it can leave your skin ""textured"", what I would recommend is to ensure you are using a good moisturizer and a well formulated primer that is compatible with the foundation. All primers do not work with all foundations formula wise and can therefore cause separation of the product. 😊 * I first got color matched in store with this brand in 2021 and after not being able to find it for a while thought it to be discontinued but im so happy its not! This is the best, checks all my boxes - great color match, redness control, extremely buildable, and does not break me out. 5 stars all the way!! * I've been using the 4-in-1 Love Your Selfie Longwear Foundation & Concealer for 4 years now, and honestly… nothing compares. I have normal/oily skin with most of my oil in the T-zone, and this foundation covers everything without feeling heavy or cakey.

Pro tip: prep is everything. Cleanse, moisturize, use a good primer, apply your foundation, then lock it in with a setting spray. When trying a new foundation, minor breakouts for the first couple of weeks can be normal, but if it keeps happening… it's probably not your match.

One bottle lasts me about 4–5 months, and I use it 2–5 times a week.
If you want longwear, full coverage, and real skin confidence, this is it. * absolutely  great color match.  Great texture and natural looking coverage * It leaves the skin with a terrible texture. * I've been wearing this makeup for quite a while. My biggest complaint is that I have to buy two different colors and blend them to get a decent color match. Other than that it's got great coverage. * PUR foundation is one of the best product used on my face! My photos are clear when used and makes me smile when I look at myself. Thank you!"
81,nars,light reflecting advanced skincare foundation,pimprod2030141,2591148," * This is my all-time favorite foundation (and I have a lot including Haus Labs, Charlotte Tilbury, & Giorgio Armani to name a few). The finish is absolutely beautiful — it looks like real skin but better. It blurs pores and texture without being matte or heavy, and gives the perfect natural glow without looking oily or shiny. The coverage is buildable and never cakey, and it wears incredibly well throughout the day without breaking apart. It truly melts into the skin and makes my complexion look smooth, even, and healthy. I always come back to this one no matter what else I try * On my 37-year-old skin, this is pretty glorious. It's light, but you can build it where you need more coverage. It layers beautifully over SPF and sits under powder without getting cakey or weird.

It also doesn't LOOK like makeup. It just kind of melts in and makes my skin look more even and healthy instead of think and makeupy. It also doesn't sit in my fine lines like SO MANY other foundations!

Only downside is wear time. It's good through the workday, but by evening it's definitely fading. I wish it lasted a little longer, but it's still my go to foundation! * I love everything about this foundation. I also loved Sheer Glow and I wish i could still get it. These two NARS foundations and the RCC are the only ones to get it right for me. My only perfect shade, only con is the price! * I tend to stick to serum foundations and tints because of my dry skin since things normally cling to it and decided to buy this on a whim during an event at Ulta because it came with some freebies (which I also LOVED) and this foundation is gorgeous. I have always loved Nars products such as the glosses, blushes, bronzers and concealer, but never wanted to spend the money on a foundation until now. It looked like my skin but more polished and was the perfect base for the rest of my makeup. You have officially converted me.

Now if only Nars could bring back ""Sin"" blush in the new formula and they would make my day! * i LOVE this foundation. i struggle with hormonal cystic acne. always have and a lot of products worsen my skin. so much so that i stopped wearing makeup for about 2-3 years. i bought this foundation about two weeks ago and will for sure be buying more when i run out. the shade match is amazing, it doesnt oxidize at all. ive full on slept in my makeup and i wake up with no new pimples and no clogged pores. i pair it with other water based products and my skin is thriving! im so happy i found this foundation bc now i can wear my makeup without it feeling heavy and without causing new breakouts!😊 * I wanted to love this after reading the good reviews , but it made my face look pastie. Not at all what I expected from a high end foundation . * I typically wear light to light medium foundation shades and wanted to try something different since I wear Haus Lab but it oxidizes. I saw so many people use Nars and wanted to join in but I think my skin just hates me at this rate ;-; I purchased 3 shades lighter and I wore it as lightly as possible during the application process and within 4 hours my face looked darker than my entire body. It sucks since the foundation is super pricy and claims to be anti-oxidize when its seperating and oxidizing severely during light applications. I love how watery it is since it makes it easier and faster to deal with in the morning, but I guess I'll have to return it since it didnt work out. Oh, also, it causes breakouts if your combo/oily/acne prone skin regardless of primer."

You get the no-makeup makeup look effortlessly. I don't use a brush or sponge to apply, just my fingers, and a dime size covers my face. I got lucky; I stocked up before y'all sold it out! Yet, I'm glad you all found something that fits well! * Great color and application however through out the day starts to leave my skin a little greasy. * I've bought this twice now , trying to get it to work for me. I've used it with primer, no primer, fingers, sponge, brush. Its always peels and looks terrible. I'm pretty knowlegable when it comes to makeup and I've used alot of different foundations. I love Chanel and love some of their other foundation, but not this one. * I've been wearing this for 4 years and will never buy another.  It goes on light and easy, adds a nice luminous glow to my skin and provides even and light coverage. * Thank goodness ULTA Carrie's this now!! The ONLY foundation that does NOT settle in your fine lines and I have mega lines still doesn't settle, I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION, please chanel never discontinue this! * I love how my skin feels with this Chanel foundation it looks and feels so smooth. I've been using it for five years now. * I've literally tried 5 foundations in the last 2 months all claiming to do the same thing. I have acne scars very large pores deep smile lines that collect the makeup.... And I'm 53. All the nightmares!!!!  This foundation!!!  I mean common!!!  It covered everything!  It blurred the pores on my nose, which nothing ever has, it didn't settle it those deep lines, even the ones in the corner of my mouth!!!  I looked Dewey all day!  I felt like I was wearing nothing. It wasn't even the right shade cause they were out but I just used a bit of bronzer and omg perfection!!  I will never ever use anything else. Yes it's a bit fragrant but that disappears in a few hours no big deal."
83,smashbox,halo healthy glow tinted moisturizer broad spectrum spf 25,pimprod2016307,2568499," * This is a moisturizing BB/CC/tinted moisturizer with some bonus SPF. It is great for mature skin that gets dry and dehydrated from most foundations. I really like being able to just put some on with my fingers over SPF and get some nice coverage and evening out of redness. It does not emphasize pores or dry patches. I use it like a tinted moisturizer, so I just apply and don't really blend it in, lol, and it looks fine. I also don't powder it and I don't expect to stay perfectly in place all day. I really like using this because it's a thin, light additional layer of SPF, and I know I've only applied a thin first layer of SPF 50, so it's a little insurance SPF. My super-sensitive skin simply cannot handle the recommended glob of first layer SPF no matter what the formula is, so I can only do a thin layer of it, and then I add the Halo Tinted Moisturizer with SPF25.

PS. My skintone is fair-light with yellow/green undertones (Nars Gobi and Urban Decay Light Cool Green) , and I've used multiple tubes of Halo in shade Light. * I have super dry, super sensitive skin. this  covers redness, blends well, doesnt look cakey, doesn't cause breakouts (which i only wear full make up about twice a week) I still usually apply a moisturizer beforehand. maybe wouldn't recommend for oily skin * I keep coming back to this because my dry skin LOVES it. I have yet to find another base product that sits as well as this does on my skin. It's a shame that the shade just isn't quite right. I am very fair with a pink undertone, and the lightest shade is a little too orange. It also oxidizes a bit so if I don't blend my jawline well, the contrast is noticeable. This gives me such a healthy glow and doesn't exaggerate my dry patches like other foundations/tinted base products do. It's the perfect coverage I'm looking for too. I don't think I'm the only person wishing for more cool/olive options! * Makes me feel greasy every time :'( * I have been searching for years for a light coverage product that will just even out my skin tone without feeling heavy at all. I am really particular about my facial products and any kind of makeup- if it feels heavy at all, I won't continue to use it. this product is perfect for me! I have again, dry 40 year old skin. I do my skin care and apply this right after my moisturizer and it evens me out beautifully while allowing my skin to breathe! I wear light neutral shade and there's zero orange undertone. I can't feel the product on my face, it just feels like part of my skin care routine. it also contains SPF which is a huge plus as well. wears perfectly all day long without making me greasy at all, which tends to happen with all foundations I've tried. this covers all my redness which is exactly what I need. no breakouts and no scent. please never stop making this! * It was on clearance and I see why. If you have acne prone skin run the other direction from this product. I tried twice before realizing this was the root of my end of day flare ups!!! It did not take long for it to form cysts. * now that I'm in my 40s, my skin is changing. it's more dry and my pores are bigger, in addition to having discoloration from previous years of tanning and no SPF. I was looking for something very lightweight that I can't feel, that contains SPF and also evens out my skin tone while adding some glow. a tall order, but this product full the bill in full! I tried it without putting on moisturizer first, and I wouldnt recommend that. it wasn't quite moisturizing enough to stand on its own for me. so if you are drier, definitely moisturize first then apply right away. the glow is beautiful but not at all greasy. it blended right in with no tool needed, and my cream blush went on over it perfectly. didn't feel heavy at all either. in fact I forgot id put it on at all after a half hour or so. it evened out my skin tone beautifully while allowing my freckles to show through a little too. love it!"
84,polite society,more than a pretty face skin-caring foundation,pimprod2040619,2615146," * While I like the texture and how it makes my skin look, the shades are entirely off. I normally wear a Fair/Fair Light Warm, and the ""Fair Warm"" I received looks more like a Light/Medium Warm, so it's a much deeper shade than I expected. * You can wear it very sheer like a tinted moisturizer. It has great skin care, benefits, including hydration, poor minimizing, and brightening. You can also build it up to medium or full coverage. It's never cakey or thick. I love it! * honestly this is my favorite foundation on the market. BUT PLEASE CHANGE THE BOTTLE AND THE PUMP. * I purchased shade Very Light Neutral and I'm happy with my purchase. I am a foundation girlie!  I was not gifted this item. I spent my money on it. I think that matters when giving opinions on products. I would consider this a medium coverage, I use the Polite Society peach loose powder to set. It doesn't last all day, but, it stays pretty for several hours. I haven't had problems with the pump like others have and the cap is a little difficult to get off sometimes, but I would purchase again.m formula works well with my skin. * This did not apply well, it was really thin and kind of streaky.. It did build well once I got it smoothed out, but it didn't last very long and made my face feel oily. * I love this foundation. But i wish they would create another type of dispenser. The pump is not user friendly at all. * This is the best for long wear. Highly recommend it"
85,estÃ©e lauder,futurist skin tint serum foundation spf 20,pimprod2041704,2612381," * I am 52 and have combination skin and this feels very drying on my skin. The color match was great, I just dont like the chalky feeling. * I'm a 55 year old who is obsessed with Estee Lauder. I wish I would have discovered it in my 20s. Their products last long because they are very rich or pigmented and of premium quality. I'm gradually turning over most of my skin care and make up to the brand. This skin tint product is perfect for me. I never wore heavy foundation but as I age, my skill is dull and has sun spots and broken capillaries. I used the futurist hydra rescue and still grab it from time to time because it's an incredible product with amazing coverage. I look a little too ""made up"" in it for my personal preference. This serum skin tint is perfect for me. Enough coverage and hydrating to brighten my skin and give some color. It is lightweight enough that it dries down nicely without much transfer and doesn't feel heavy. I'm in love! I pair it with Estee concealer and their cheek gel. So natural and glowing! * The first time I used this product it went on smoothly and gave me the coverage I was looking for..This definitely will be my choice of makeup from now on. * I use this instead of foundation plus concealer. It provides great coverage AND covers my dark circles pretty well. Definitely worth the money! * I love this product! I have flaky dry skin that constantly breaks out due to some medical conditions i have. But this tinted moisturizer not only has great coverage, it also sits well on my face. It looks like im wearing foundation. I get many compliments when i wear this. I mainly use it for work only as i dont like using my other foundations every day but i think this is the one i'll be using daily anyway. The finish is so nice i also like to lightly set it for a dewy look. * This serum foundation is exactly what I was looking for my dry, dehydrated skin. Even though my skin is dehydrated, it still in need of something light, not heavy on it. And this is exactly how that serum feels. * Perfect color match. However, it looks drying and gets in my facial lines. Dont recommend for older dry skin"

87,morphe,lightform extended hydration foundation,pimprod2043869,2621366," * I used to use Neutrogena serum foundation for sensitive skin. It was rhe beat foundation I've ever used but I am now making sure everything I use is cruelty free. Morphe foundation is awesome! I combine it with the cocokind gel cream moisturizer because I need the extra hydration. They combine nicely. And this foundation is a great deal. I tried some more expensive ""hydrating"" foundations from other companies and my skin looked awful. * I've only been using this for a few days, but I like it a lot. It's got excellent coverage and a nice glow to it, similar to NARS. 

I'm oily and acne prone and this works pretty well. The only issue I've had is that it really doesn't build well. It gets cakey if you apply too much, so i would just cover problem spots with concealer and keep to one (maybe two) light layers of this foundation.

Overall, I'm very impressed, especially for the price. It feels prestige to me. I also got a really good color match right off the bat, despite ordering online. Thanks Morphe!! * I love this foundation!! Not only does it stay on my face, but its also reasonably priced! I've been using this foundation for what seems like forever, but they recently sold out of my shade everyone- on the Morphe website too. I have tried 3 foundations since running out and have not found anything that even compares to the Morphe foundation. Hoping they restock because I am over using bad foundations! * I need to bring the Lightform Extended Hydration foundation back or a trade it for the correct shade. Please advise * I love the coverage and the natural look it gives worth it's money * I bought this foundation 2weeks ago. I love how it goes on with my Morphe brush! I also use the Sunrise powder & all the eye make. I have gotten compliments on my make up. So far I'm very happy with my Morphe products! * Was sold out before Christmas and I was bummed. Tried another day and it was not only back in stock, but on sale!! I'm 59 yo, and have super dry skin with rosacea as well. The formula is fairly thin/runny but it covers ssooo nicely. It's buildable without looking thick/heavy. Skin prep was; a rice toner, Neutrogena Hydro Boost serum and Hydro Boost water gel moisturizer and ELF power grip primer. Color is Light 06C"
88,estÃ©e lauder,double wear sheer long-wear foundation spf 19,pimprod2027234,2586142," * The Estée Lauder Double Wear Sheer Long-Wear Foundation in shade 1W1 Bone has become my go-to for a lightweight, polished everyday look. It offers the perfect amount of sheer coverage to even out my skin tone without feeling heavy or cakey—my skin still looks like skin, just smoother and more radiant.

I love that it lasts all day without oxidizing or sliding off, even in warmer weather. The added SPF 19 is a great bonus for daily sun protection, and the formula plays well with both moisturizers and primers underneath.

If you're looking for a breathable foundation that holds up beautifully while still letting your natural complexion shine through, this is it. A little goes a long way, and the finish is effortlessly beautiful. Total staple in my makeup bag! * I bought this from Ulta and was so excited to try it.
What a disappointment! It was so runny and watery. It didn't really even do anything for my complexion. I've used Double Wear Stay in Place for a long time, and I wanted something lighter for Summer. But this stuff should not even be called a foundation. It's not a skin tint either. For the price point of over $50.00 it was a complete waste of money. * I absolutely love the look & feel of this product. Great for everyday natural & i can build up for more coverage. I set it with the BareMinerals Originial Loose veil setting powder in Translucent. And it lasted the full 12HRs!!!! * This was my favorite foundation for a while now but my shade has dissappeared…really dissappointed. Why is 2N1 just gone? * I've tried three of four BB creams, sheer foundations, etc. Two of which broke me out in hives and one that was just plain awful. I came across this, and figured I'd try it since I like the original Double Wear foundation. I love this! It's lightweight, evens my skin tone, has SPF in it, and has decent coverage. Plus, it does not break me out! Will definitely purchase this again. * This ""foundation"" gives no coverage and it's so watery. I put it on my face and immediately wiped it off. I wanted a lighter feel than double wear foundation but it's horrible. * This foundation is terrible. It has no coverage and never dries. You will walk around sticky all day, which I hate, but you may not mind. It was sticky and wet even after setting with powder. I will be returning it."
89,e.l.f. cosmetics,camo hydrating cc cream spf 30,pimprod2041765,2617546," * I put this on before work and its pretty much gone by noon. I like the pump. * Tried it on without a primer and hated it, way too heavy for a cc, highlighted my pores more than it covered it, meduim cover and for some reason it made me look yellowish i wouldnt recommend for pale people * I originally bought this believing it was a under eye concealer. I was in a hurry and I had heard good reviews from friends. It's a perfect match for me. I have dry and mature skin . My face drinks this up perfectly! * I needed a cheap everyday foundation and was already an elf fan so thought I'd give this a try. The shade matches really well! I also think it does a great job on color correction — as a trans woman I generally use a lot of color correction for facial hair and pigmentation from acne, but I find I don't need to at all with this.

It's definitely full coverage, which is a pro or con depending on what you are looking for. Using a sponge lessens that somewhat.

The biggest con is that the formulation is really creamy. I mix it 2-to-1 with a hyaluronic acid serum though and that does wonders for the texture and keeping it fresh for the whole day. * I would rate this w/5 stars comparing with more expensive brands… * The foundation covers beaitifully * I bought this since it had great reviews and i was looking for a cheaper alternative to the IT cosmetics CC cream and I have other elf products I love so i figured it was worth a shot. WRONG. This is probably the worst product i have ever put on my skin. I prepped my skin, made sure the primer I used had the same base. The second i put it on it legit settled into every pore to the point where it looked like i had foundation colored freckles. I tried applying with a brush, my finger tips, and a beauty blender in different areas to see if that made a difference, but no luck. Will not be buying again."
90,urban decay cosmetics,hydromaniac tinted moisturizer,pimprod2021082,2567739," * There's not enough colors to choose from. It leaves my face looking a little orange. Right now, I am in between two colors. One is too dark. The other one is too light. It is buildable and feels nice on my face though. * I have super sensitive skin. This stuff didnt break me out at all. Felt light on my skin. Im in florida so i need something that will cover up. I love it alot. Its not for everyone but i love it. Again my skin is super sensitive so having to go with pricy make up i need to make sure its worth every penny: this stuff is worth every penny. * way too thick, heavy like thick foundation * I really love this foundation as someone with dry skin and getting more fine lines. I kinda forgot about this one because I wore powder foundation for a while and recently switched back to liquid. I really, really love this. It doesnt look cakey, but builds beautifully. I will say i got a teeny bit oily on my forehead, but id rather have a quick fix through the day with powder than have a super dry cakey look. I really recommend this.

It also didnt break apart or separate on my skin. Ill def be using this again. I like this more than my makeup forever hydrating foundation. * I prefer a light and cake free foundation. I was using Jane Iredale but they made a change to their foundation that did not work well for me.  I found this foundation and mix it with Jane Iredale primer to get the perfect consistency and color. * Perhaps it was my fault. I went to Ulta and asked the sales associate to help me find a light tinted moisturizer. This is much too thick and heavy to be that. It looks cakey on my skin, which I didn't realize until I got hom. * Absolutely love this product, it goes on smooth and feels weightless. I tried a different brand and went back to this because I love it so much."
91,estee lauder,futurist hydra rescue moisturizing foundation spf 45,pimprod2013152,2577966," * Great product for mature skin. * I'm 42 and my skin is on the drier side. I was looking for an alternative to IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Foundation, because they don't make a color that matches my skin very well. This Estee Lauder foundation is a good color match, but it makes my skin look really dry. It doesn't last very long, and I don't like the added fragrance. * I was hoping this foundation would work for me since it was reviewed as good for sensitive skin.  It burnt my face and took a week to heal.  I would not buy this if you have sensitive skin.  If you don't have sensitive skin, it does provide nice coverage. * Thought I would splurge on this and wish I didn't. Within minutes this foundation settled into and accentuated every pore, line,  and wrinkle on my face. Trying yo get it to blend just makes it get mire blotchy. I am going to try to return it. I don't recommend this. * Crazy hydrating to the point it was an oil slick. I looked like a hormonal teen upon application. Also - what happened with the shades?? I'm a perfect match for 2C3 Fresco in EL's Double Wear foundation.  But this? Futurist Hydra in 2C3 Fresco is about 3-4 shades too light!! Completely different color/shade than Double Wear!! DEF SHADE UP (go WAY darker) with this!!  Not sure why shade matching had to be made so much more difficult that it already was, but dangit - $$ wasted. This stuff is also best for over 55yo skin imo, not those over 35yo that are just starting to get creasing & lines. Def best for VERY dry, post menopause, etc. I'm 45yo, & this was far too much ""hydration"" for me (didn't think that was possible - but it IS.) It just smeared all over my face like oil & transferred far too easily. It also didn't wear nearly as long as Double Wear, although I understand the difference, lol. BUT it was not at all creasey, nor dry & cakey, so for that, I gave it 3 stars. I can see this working great on me when I hit 55-60yo plus, but just not right now.  Pricey as all get-out too. Plz fix the shades to match your other foundation colors, it's ridiculously different! * This makeup has great coverage, matches skin tone better than most, lasts all day and just a very good makeup * Goes on smooth light weight great coverage.i will buy this product again .this is the first time I purchase this brand of foundation.

I just starred using it a couple of weeks ago and now its hard to come out? Anyone else have this issue. I don't mind spending the money on my skin but I want the product to last and I do not overuse. * Chanel has been one of my favorite go-to brands for so many years and I just keep coming back after attempts to find something ""new and different"".  Through the years and many different formulations of foundations, this one has been a repurchase for me over the past few years. My mature skin is on the drier side so finding a good foundation that doesn't make matters worse and without a lot of drying ingredients, is not an easy task.  That said, this fits the bill.  I use serum and moisturizer with SPF and this foundation glides on without settling into my fine lines or making my skin appear matte and lifeless.  I prefer minimal foundation so this one works great for me. * Best foundation i have ever tried. Leaves a flawless finish that lasts all day. No caking. I have recieved compliments on my skin, that it glows. * Great product. Good coverage, not heav * 41 combo skin w inner dryness, lrg pores.

Skin looks like skin but w/ coverage Oily tzone needs help.  bd31-  actually yellow and not pink like other chanel fd * Debating how I feel about it...
Pros: 
color match was good (BD01 is good match for my neutral pale skin. I'm around 13-17 in Korean foundations)
Easy to apply with fingers, not streaky 
Not finicky (doesn't apply nicely one day then horribly the next)
Doesn't get messy when it fades
Looks very natural
When oils breakthrough, it looks glowy rather than greasy

Cons:
Only lasts like 2 hours before starting to fade. Doesn't fade completely until maybe 6 hours though
Longevity doesn't improve much with primer
Not sure if it's caused a small breakout

I'll try a few more days before deciding if I want to return it. I've been looking for a light foundation with skincare I can throw on. I have other foundations I like for long days but still I wish this lasted a bit longer than a few hours, for its price. If I do keep it, I won't repurchase. * I have combo skin (oily t-zone, dry cheeks and chin) and I also have moderate rosacea (reddness and bumps) and it covers my skin like a dream! I've tried many viral foundations and always find myself coming back to this one. I just finished my second bottle and no doubt will be purchasing my third!"
94,smashbox,always on skin-balancing foundation with hyaluronic acid + adaptogens,pimprod2040206,2610447," * I don't normally leave reviews, but this foundation is so good that I had to share my experience. I've tried countless foundations over the years, from drugstore brands to high-end, and for many years my holy grail was MAC Pro Longwear Foundation (before it was sadly discontinued). I truly never thought I'd find anything that could replace it, but Smashbox Always On actually wins, even over MAC Pro Longwear.

I'm in my forties with combination skin, large pores, fine lines, wrinkles, and some age spots, so I'm very particular about foundation. I look for something long-wearing that doesn't require constant reapplication, provides strong coverage without looking heavy or cakey, and minimizes the appearance of pores.

This foundation exceeded my expectations. It covered my age spots beautifully without needing layers or concealer, yet still looked natural and skin-like. My complexion looked smooth and flawless, not thick or cakey. It blurred my pores, didn't settle into fine lines or wrinkles, and gave my skin a soft-focus, blurred effect,  and a natural finish.

The wear time is excellent. It stayed put all day and still looked great at the end of the day, without breaking down.

It is a bit pricey, but it is of great quality. I'm officially a huge fan and will definitely be buying this as my everday foundation. Smashbox nailed this formula, and I highly recommend it. * I've used this foundation for years and love how it stays on. * I have combination skin. I can get oily on the cheeks and the forehead and I love this foundation. I never have to touch up my makeup with this foundation. I prep my skin with Fenty Hydra Vizor Invisible Face Moisturizer with SPF 30 and Niacinamide, then just around my dry areas and where I want to prime (on and around my nose and between my eyes and forehead) I put on Makeup Forever Step 1 Primer Hydra Booster. I apply the foundation with a damp beauty blender and then apply blush …I very lightly set my forehead, nose, and chin with a setting powder. It lasts all day (15 + hours) and doesn't clog my skin. The color range is really nice! * On my second bottle just a few shades darker after getting tanned because the first one was a lighter shade but the quality is that amazing *chefs kiss* * I've been happy with this until recently. They seem to have changed the shades so ordering my normal one makes me look ghostly. Got one shade darker than normal but the formula is super runny now. * Was looking for Smashbox Studio 24  replacement. This is it!! Love the all day smooth w oil control. I will buy this again 
😊 * Goes on smooth and light and stays put. Definitely a great foundation."
95,maybelline,super stay 24h skin tint + vitamin c,pimprod2039657,2610817," * This is beautiful blends in with my skin as it is my own skin * This skin tint w/out the proper skin prep clings to any imperfections (I would avoid if you have large pores). If you have dry skin definitely use moisturizer prior to using. Just after a few hours of wear turns orange!! * This is suchhhh a good skin tint! Its a skin tint but it has enough coverage to cover my acne but doesnt look cakey and its infused with vitamin C so going to brighten over time! And the best thing is it actually stays on all day! Which was huge for me, I worked nine hours yesterday and my makeup wore off around my mouth but everywhere else still looked really good! * Okay this has insanely mixed reviews, and I realised that with this tint it's all about the prep. Make sure you've got a *very* moisturised base before putting it on. I wore this all day for about 14 hours and it didn't budge, there was no creasing or dry patches. I noticed that after a few hours it was looking a little shiny in the places I didn't powder, so if you have oily skin (I have normal skin), be aware of that. But it honestly didn't get oily and start breaking apart in places or anything. I think it's got great coverage, but it's not cakey. Start by applying a thin layer and build up from there, and it shouldn't look cakey. I'm honestly really happy with the purchase, it's the first skin tint I'm trying. Before this, I only used the L'Oréal Infallible foundation and to be honest, this is much better. I liked the finish of the L'Oreal but this Maybelline is longer lasting and looks flawless on the skin. It's also easy to add products to it after application, it doesn't dry super fast. * The coverage, the finish, love EVERYTHING except the smell. It is sooooooo strong, I can smell it all day. It is not pleasant. I understand why, with the ingredients it has, but ugh, I can't find anything like it formula wise. I may just suck it up and deal with the smell! * My holy grail for a skin tint that's affordable. Its the only foundation/skin tint that ive found that doesnt crease in the smile lines. Its a game changer if that is a issue that you deal with as well.  Its also the most skin like and last all day long. * It went on very well and felt really nice. A few hours later, I was orange (oxidation) with texture like tree bark. I looked like a wizened gnome. For reference, however, I'm mature with slightly dry skin, living in a low humidity climate. People not in these categories should look at other reviews."
96,l'orÃ©al,true match super-blendable foundation,pimprod2034733,2602421," * I had this exact foundation in my 20s, and it worked great. Tried it today, and granted, a little goes a long way. But, just a little bit on my face showed my lines, (ones I didn't know I had), all my pores, and went on cakey, even after applying a second coat as suggested with my $30 foundation brush. I got some No7 all in one, and Maybelline fit me dewy foundation also. They did not leave the lines, texture or enlarged pores. I'm returning this L'Oreal ASAP. * The lighest shades of this foundaiton are striaght up yellow no matter the undertone you choose and they're also not very light. If you're pale don't waste your money and have to deal with returning it later. * This is my holy grail foundation and I own in different shades for summer and winter. To me this beats high end foundations in finish and value. This product is thin, so doesn't get cakey, doesnt oxidize, and doesn't break down after a full day's wear. This is also my go to if I have acne breakouts and want to even my skin tone but don't want to further clog my pores. It feels so lightweight on the skin! This is also probably a good option for beginners since its so easy to blend and layer, but I'd recommend to anyone! * I have combo skin with areas that get really oily, and this is one of the only foundations that lasted against my super oily areas like my nose! It didnt get shiny or slip around, and i didnt even use any prep 😅 it looks gorgeous, my skin looked so smooth and it gave decent coverage. It's definitely not full coverage but i just spot concealed which made everything look like skin instead of being cakey. I really recommend this, it performs better than a lot of high end foundations for me! * This one is tried and true! I started using it in high school and I still love it! * If you get this, get the Ulta Jelly Bounce primer to go under it and thank me later! The combo is amazing! I also use the Elf Pore-fecting toner before the primer. Try it! * I wanted to like this of the revirws.  However, after about 3-4 wears, I noticed how drying this was. This will cling to the peach fuzz on your skin, and will dry you out especially if you already have dry and/or combo skin. Also, I would call this a low coverage foundation, more like a skin tint."
97,estÃ©e lauder,double wear stay in place matte powder foundation refill,pimprod2031253,2593713," * I love this foundation. I first tried the stay wear liquid but I found that I like the stay wear powder foundation better. I have combination skin with hormonal acne and it doesn't aggravate my acne at all. I usually just get a under the skin bump or two on my chin a week before my cycle and this foundation doesn't make it worse or aggravate it in any way. I don't have any injections or fillers and I have some fine lines and it doesn't sit in those lines making me look older so I definitely like that. I take good care of my skin and  believe in aging gracefully. I know I am getting older and the wrinkles are coming but thats okay with me. My smile lines are from the wonderful smiles and laughs I've had and I wear them proudly. I eat a healthy diet, workout every morning and I only drink water and my skin reflects that and looks healthy. Just because we age doesn't mean we won't look good anymore. Healthy, glowing skin is beautiful at any age in my opinion. So, I use this powder foundation all year round and I definitely recommend using a good primer for your skin type before applying this foundation. It definitely keeps it looks good thru your work day. I use to solely use Clinique and I still use their eye shadow, mascara, blush and skincare but I had a good friend introduce me to this foundation and I literally ran out to get it lol. Just remember every day you wake up is a gift and a chance to shine :) * Once I apply Esstee's  Double wear foundation I use her compact powder to set the foundation.  It is a perfect complement to the foundation. * Love products * I wear 1c1 in winter but 2c1 in summer,I love how easy it is to change out shades with these refills. It's a wonderful, flexible formula that's never cakey. * I buy ivorynude (one if the lightest shades).The color mathecs perfects, at first. However, with a couple hours, my makeup looks a couple shades darker. I have worn this on my tropical vacations and it holds against water, still looking perfect. If you buy a couple shades lighter, it may work for you. * Love the smooth look 👌 * I am 47 with normal to dry skin. Full coverage long lasting!"
98,dior,forever natural nude foundation,pimprod2036826,2604394," * This foundation is amazing..it's as if the Forever Matte and Glow had a baby.  It gives such a beautiful satin finish that is not too matte and not too glowy just perfect. I will definitely buy this again and I've recommended it to quite a few of my friends and they love it as well! * I have been trying to decide why I am not reaching for this foundation and I have come to the conclusion I may have gotten an old bottle. The texture is thick and gel like; not what I would expect from a ""nude natural"" foundation. Looks cakey. and when I shake it I don't hear or feel any movement in the bottle. It doesn't really smell spoiled although it does have a fragrance as Dior does. I have tried thinning it out with oil or moisturizer but then it doesn't dry down as it should. I am disappointed but don't know if it's actually the product or that I received  an old bottle. Unfortunately I tossed the box. It's not impossible as I have received  expired products from the warehouse on a couple of other occasions. But I have definitely had better foundations that cost less. * I was not wowed by this foundation. maybe my color match wasn't the best. I am fair to light with a neutral leaning slightly warm complexion and I don't think there is a great match for me in this product. I did not find this product to look very natural or give me any sort of radiance. I felt it looked semi matte rather than a natural finish. Coverage was fine-light to medium as expected. I much prefer Chanel's Healthy Glow foundation. I have mature skin and think perhaps this foundation is better suited to a younger customer. I didn't dislike it but I would not repurchase it. For me it looked rather flat no matter how I prepped my skin. * This is a fantastic foundation! It's lightweight and  leaves me looking naturally flawless. I will say it doesn't completely cover dark spots/acne but I am personally fine with that- nothing a little concealer can't help with. I will definitely be repurchasing. * Wonderful product! * This is the best foundation that I have tried in at least the last 5 years of searching for ""the one"".  Not too heavy or too light. Not cakey and does not settle into my fine lines. This foundation lasts throughout the workday and well into the evening. Definitely worth the price. Finally!  I've found the one!! * Here's a quick review you can use for Dior foundation at Ulta:

""I absolutely love how smooth the Dior foundation applies to my skin! It blends effortlessly, giving me a flawless finish that feels lightweight yet provides great coverage. The formula feels luxurious, and it lasts all day without creasing or feeling heavy. Whether you're going for a natural look or building it up for full glam, this foundation is a game-changer. Highly recommend trying it out—you won't be disappointed!"""
99,mac,studio radiance serum powered foundation,pimprod2040797,2613967," * I will  return  a product * Before trying this MAC foundation, I was using Too Faced Born This Way foundation. Now that I am 46 years old, I am looking for a foundation that is not so thick and heavy. I really like how light the foundation feels and leaves a dewy look... but I'm still not sold on the coverage. I don't know if it's because I'm used to such full coverage or if it's because my skin tone is not matching right? I like it.. I'm just not sure if I LOVE it. My favorite part of this bottle.. is being able to turn to keep it from accidentally leaking and easy to keep clean! * I'm on camera for my job and I needed something to cover up the hyperpigmentation and blemishes on my face. I was wearing the just Mac concealer because my past experiences with other brand foundations just never worked out (like I'd buy them and return immediately bc they looked terrible). This foundation changed all of that. It's a beautiful finish and goes on seamlessly. People don't know I'm wearing makeup, which I love. Many ask me my skincare routine and I silently laugh to my self bc if they only knew lol But YES, give it a try. You'll love it! * Makes skin look amazing * This foundation has incredible coverage without looking unnatural. With only 1 pump, my uneven skin tone and redness disappear. On camera and at the end of the day, my skin looks just as flawless as when I first applied it. * If you have dry skin or mature, dry skin, this is an absolute mess. It goes on Everett. Leslie gives you a glow without looking like your radiant and is so soft on your skin. I absolutely love it, and I pair it with my radiant concealer for an absolutely stunning look. * I love this foundation,  I have been using this for a few years. it goes on smooth, makes your skin light and silky. Best Ever"

And also, when you remove the sponge from the bottom, it doesn't close * This product is worth buying again.  I just wish it had a cotton powder puff instead of sponge for application. * I give it a 2.7 because when first applied its pretty but bery dry and the prouduct shattered after the 2nd use when opened. * I am a simple girl and I wanted a foundation that I can swipe on and stay on all day. This product does that and more! Matches my skin perfectly :) * Perfect long lasting and it does not feel cakey * It's just OK. I didn't feel like the color was great at matching and I didn't feel like it really smooth my skin or covered my pores. It also made my skin feel very dry. * O like this product but still looking to see if there is anything else better for my aging oily skin.

On full glam days I use this powder for touch ups around my nose and mouth, and I use it to blend any harsh edges around my blush and bronzer to get a soft gradient. On natural days I use this to even out my skin and it's the perfect coverage: not too sheer but not quite a true medium either. I hope Tarte never stops making this because this fills a major gap in my makeup maintenance! * I'm 49 with dry skin so I have to moisturize really well and this was easy to apply over a heavy moisturizer. blends seamlessly and has a flawless finish all day however in the end it made my skin dry kind of  just depleted the moisture and made my face dry by the second day I used it. I wanted to love this and keep it but i had to return it * Clean ingredients are important to me as is buildable coverage.  This goes on perfectly and can use a little or more for coverage.  love the compact and works even better with the primer.  Good selections of colors which is also a plus.  highly recommend * I have oily skin and I used to use the MAC compact but they changed their formula so o switched to this and I couldn't be more happier that I did. 
I'm in my 40s and useless daily. Ladies in our 40s, please don't forget to use setting spray to set the powder so it does not look Cakey or dry. * I have been using this powder foundation for a few months now, and while sometimes it's tricky to find the right primer to put underneath it. I do like it overall. It has a good medium coverage and sits well on my skin. I have combination skin, oily in the t zone, dry on the cheeks. I feel that it blends in with my skin well and while I don't think it lasts 18 hours, I do feel like it lasts almost all day with very minimal touchup.. * Love it! * This was my first time using one of the Tarte foundations and this one did not work for me. I have combination normal/oily skin and this just made my skin very oily and break out. I did return it and switch back to my normal brand"

I have dry and sensitive skin and this set on my aging skin beautifully and not sits in my lines and wrinkles.  I don't powder over this at all.  Will keep buying when running out. * I'm not sure if they've reformulated this foundation, but it's pretty runny. I have used this foundation for years, but the consistency is very different now. I loved how it looked and felt, prior to this. * I really wanted this to work but its one of the worst I've ever tried. At first, it goes on beautifully. After about an hour, its just a mess. By 5 hours, its horrible and you cant wait to wash it off. It has zero staying power and oxidizes like crazy. This will be returned. * After my much beloved Guerlain foundation was discontinued, I started searching for a new one.  I tried this one on a whim and like it.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it does not have an spf.  No oxidation, no shiny finish, it goes on well. * I'm extremely picky with foundation, and have tried so many brands both high and low end but always end up returning them for various issues. I've been searching for a foundation that hides imperfections instead of making them worse. One that doesn't transfer too easily. One that doesn't make the oily parts of my face look greasy after a couple hours but that also won't cause my dry spots to flake. This just makes my skin look beautiful and glowing, it has great lasting power and the color match is flawless! The ONLY thing I dislike is it doesn't smell good when I apply it. It almost smells like dirty diaper mixed with grandma perfume. But once it dries there's no smell. * I have been using Armani's Luminous Silk (Shade 1.5) for 10 years and discovered that they are formulating and it's impossible to get a hold of my shade. After countless weeks of research, I decided to try the Pat McGrath foundation. I am IN LOVE. Not only is it the exact type of foundation I prefer - lightweight, sheer to medium coverage and skinlike. It might be better than the foundation I've been using for 10 years. I have applied it in a variety of ways and have been happy with the application and finish every time. I knew it was a good choice when my interaction with my favorite Dunkin Donuts employee even commented on how grest my skin looked. She sees me almost every other day and even she noticed the amazing finish. Don't let the watery finish scare you off. I think that that is what makes it such a phenomenal and skin like foundation. Absolutely recommend to anyone who has loved the Giorgio Armani foundation, has dry to normal skin and has ""mature skin"". * I have dry skin it works well to stop flakiness. Most foundations don't work well with moisturizers and cause separation but not this brand. It melts nicely and looks like skin! And no heaviness"

Both times the foundation stick was found upside down.  The stick was no longer attached to the base but had detached and was in the cap. There was no way to use this product. * I used the foundation stick manay years ago and was obsessed with the seemless coverage; however, this is not the same foundation stick. They must have changed the formula bc it goes onto your skin terribly and looks cakey, cracked immediately upon application. Ive tried four different types of primer as well as none at all and I still am left with the same look. Do not waste your money. * She went on so nicely, that at first, I was obsessed. That quickly dissipated as I wore her throughout the day. She broke apart, leaving a weird finish on skin. It still looked ok from afar but the moment you got close it was a disaster. I tried and tried again. I thought maybe it's my sunscreen, my serum, my moisturizer. But no matter what I switched out, the same thing happened - goes on great and breaks apart in an hour or two. I returned her :( * I have oily/combo acne prone skin. This product is great on my oily sections and provides a full coverage. It has an insane amount of product, I have used a lot of it and ive had it for over a year yet still have half. It can cling to my pimples a little bit but as i wear it through the day it blends into it. * I have used Hourglass (which I prefer) as well as IT Cosmetics and both have changed the description for their products (from a name to a number and vice versa). I have a number on my Hourglass stick and unfortunately can't reorder online. So frustrating!
IT doesn't even have the description on the product so that sealed the deal for them. Makes no sense why they make it so hard for the consumer. * Good color match and formula. Problem packaging, amount of product, and price. The product was stuck to the cap. I was able to get the product out and place it in a tiny jar. Packaging needs redesign for the price. Can't recommend for this reason."

I have dry skin so I always use moisturizers with my spf and no issues with pilling. It's enough coverage to smooth uneven skin spots while still looking so natural and lasts all day. * i was looking for a new tinted moisturizer that matched well with my juvia's Place concealer and this did the job. light to medium coverage but sat well throughout the morning. * Ulta continues to sell this product online knowing the product has expired. * Wish I saw the reviews before I bought this. Saw it was cheap so I decide to buy it. Got pretty good matches and when I go to throw away the boxes I see ""EXP 11/25"" on the bottom (it's 1/26 btw)... And they have the nerve to ask for it back for ""internal review""? Would recommend if it wasn't expired though! 

P.S. not sure if it's expired too but my sister got a stay after using the concealer * No surprise sadly, as the leadership for this brand has fallen apart and gone silent. They probably arent even producing new stock. Its extra disgusting that ulta would send out expired products, as using expired sunscreen on your face is a risk. Ive destroyed my skin barrier with expired sunscreen before. What a shame. * I just received my order and this product had expired two months ago! * I really liked the shade and lightweight texture of it! I tried it on my hand, but since I got an expired product, I won't be using it. It expired on 11/25. Hopefully, it will be restocked"
106,hourglass,ambient soft glow foundation,pimprod2033509,2599657," * I love this foundation. I use the veil in the summer. Needed a little more coverage for winter. This is not drying, easy application. Its a quality foundation. * I had seen advertisements and some influencers I follow have raved about this products and they were right! Mikah at the Pikeville, Ky collection helped me find my perfect shade with the first try! * I wasnt all that jazzed about this foundation at first. I am 51 years old with combination skin and i have been on a years long mission to find a foundation that worked well with my skin. Most foundation looks great when you first put it on, but for me, it starts slipping around as the day goes on and ends up a mess by the end of the day. When I first tried this, it looked a bit cakey and clung to the dry patches on my face, but it didnt move…at all.  Then I tried applying less- like not even a quarter of a pump. That was the ticket! Perfect coverage, no cakiness, and it doesnt budge - all day long. It doesnt feel like anything on my skin. 

Not every product works for every skin type  but this is IT for me! * I really wanted to love this foundation. I love the color match and coverage, however three days in and I noticed acne ALL OVER MY FACE. So sad!!! * I have tried everything out there. Finally found this gem. Looks so natural complexion looks flawless. Light weight. I have mature skin and have lots of spots covers great with little color correction. Little expensive but a little goes a long way. Definitely worth a try * It clung to every dry patch no matter how much I prepped and it separated. * I don't usually write reviews, but I felt like I had to this time—just to give some insight before you spend your money on this foundation.

First off, I LOVE Hourglass. I've been obsessed with their concealers—they've been my go-to for so long—so I really thought I'd love their foundation too… but sadly, I was super disappointed. This foundation is not it.

For reference, I've used Estée Lauder and thought it was decent, but I was still curious to try this one. I always prep my skin well, but even with that, this foundation went on patchy and came off so easily. Ijust didn't sit right. I've never had this issue with my past foundations. Like… what?? 😩

Just wanted to share my experience in case it helps any of you. If you're looking for a reliable, everyday foundation, I honestly don't think this one is worth the price. :("

My daughter found this for me and so far i absolutely love it. The color match is perfect.  It goes on so soft and smooth and there is not a weird or strong smell. * Good coverage. * The first time gave me a rash so I waited a couple of months to make sure it was this and I tried it again and gave a red bumps all over my face. I'm not the only one. There's a lot of bad reviews w the same effect. * Excellent powder foundation for older women.  I don't know why my color doesn't seem to be available anymore though.  What's going on with the limited shade offerings?  Fenty still has all 50 shades on their website! * Ive been using this powder in shade 150 since it came out. All of a sudden theres no lighter shades? Not even one around the color ive been using. I've probably went through 10 of these compacts, and am beyond disappointed. Def gives me the ick for the brand!! * Perfect match for my skin tone. * I did the color match online and they matched me with a Shane that is not even available anymore. At the store I matched with 210 and the consultant said they are not going to carry that shade anymore. why would this supposedly inclusive brand cut all these different shades from their lineup? Now I guess I have to find another brand to buy powder from."

No fragrance, hydrating, good coverage but a  
No No for dry skin and med.-lg. pores. * Love this product.  After pumping out the foundation on back of my hand, I mix with metal spatula I also got from Ulta.  The coverage is perfect for when you want a no makeup look. * I had high hopes based on feedback from friends, but the product arrived very runny - it was like water and the beige liquid separated and would not blend well together even after I pumped the product onto my hand. I wish I had brought the product into the store for a refund. * If you're a fan of the Chanel Water Fresh Tint $70, then you should definitely try this. Coverage is identical but price difference makes it oh so much better. * i kinda want to gate keep and keep this gem to myself but omg this is amazing on the skin. I have the Chanel les beige tint and this is so comparable. I love it!!!!!!! Please dont ever discontinue * I bought this because I heard it was a dupe for a high end brand.  At first i didnt really care for this foundation but im almost done with the bottle and now I really like it.  I like that its lightweight, hydrating, leaves skin plump and healthy. It also evens out skintone and stays in through the day.  You do have to work it into the skin a little bit to get a even application because of foundation droplets. I like to use a flat (round)foundation brush. Its a very light foundation .. maybe even a skin tint.  Works wells with creams and powders.  I like mixing in some bronzing drops while applying. * I would have given this a higher rating, but this foundation irritated my skin. It made it dry, and small bumps started to appear, as well as making my pores appear larger.  Which is too bad; I would have liked this otherwise.  The first time I applied it, it evened out my blotchiness without having a thick layer of makeup on my skin, but my skin texture got progressively worse every day I wore this makeup.  So, it's not for me."

I'm so used to having to choose between a darker shade that doesn't match my neck or pale foundation that looks straight up PINK on me. This foundation is literally my skin but BETTER. * I actually was very impressed using this foundation for the first time.  Looks natural on my skin. Doesn't feel heavy.  Doesn't feel greasy. My skin actually looked really good after using it. * This product was amazing it was a game changer as someone with sensitive skin this foundation was soft to the skin and moisturizing and made your skin look refreshing. * I though this was it but even though gives you grate coverage for good couple hrs during the day to me it's too dry and powderish, so when I see my face it looks too dry. Next...! * Slightly patchy with one layer but once you do a second layer it has a great finish. It does oxidize after a little bit so I recommend maybe going a shade lighter than you normally are. Not sure if I would repurchase yet. Will continue to try it. * I loved this product for a long time. I went through 2 or 3 bottles. Such a pretty finish and perfect for dry skin. I prefer a more full coverage foundation nowadays, but would return to this if I went back to a lighter makeup look."

The pale shades look gorgeous on my complexion and does not oxidize. * This product goes on smoothly with a damp sponge. It has medium coverage and can be built up a bit. It lasts a good, long time too. I only gave it four stars because I can't find a shade that works perfectly. They're all a little too orange. * I will definitely buy it again. * Smooth and even application, blends nicely * I tried four shades in this product and none worked.  I used Ulta's shade match tool with no success. * I have used many many foundations over the years. Some I've liked, others not. This is my favorite. I have a combo/dry skin with a few fine lines and this looks lovely on the skin. Nice coverage, minimizes pores, non drying. You need to prep your skin before applying any foundation. I wear the lightest shade ivory, it doesn't oxidize or turn orange. Great foundation."

I loved that it didn't feel heavy and had a great coverage. I will be returning it though because after wearing it for two days my face started breaking out with tiny whiteheads. It certainly has something that my skin disliked. * I've been on a desperate search for a water-based foundation; unfortunately, this is still not it. I'm very pale, but not ailing Victorian child pale. I also have a pink-ish undertone, and that makes it near impossible to find a light color that doesn't make me look like I've been drained of all blood. This stuff is thick, doesn't mix well, and cakes on. I've tried it with primers, moisturizers, thinning it out, using less, using more, setting sprays and powders. The color is off, and there doesn't seem to be an acceptable shade for me, but that aside, the product is just not good. I bought it because of the great reviews, and I'm stoked for those who love it (jealous, even), but this just wasn't for me. I wouldn't deter anyone from trying it, but I wouldn't recommend it, either. I'm still playing with it to see if I can figure out how to make it work for me, but I'm close to giving up. Make of this review what you will. * I absolutely love this. Bought it on a whim and so happy I did. I have combination skin but mostly dry on my T-Zone and this leaves such a gorgous natural finish. However, this is very light coverage. If you're looking for something with more coverage I would not recommend. * I have 56 year old sensitive skin with  some discoloration/visible pores. This foundation gives me a slightly glowy, smooth but natural finish, with medium coverage using 2 pumps of product. I use the UV essential SPF underneath, then use this by applying to the back of my hand, and breaking up the pigments with fingers or brush before application. I will repurchase, even with the premium price, as there is no  comparable product in the market. Also, the shades with B are the neutrals, BR is cooler (r is for rose) and BD are warmer or more golden (dore.) This can be used a spot cover or all over foundation. The included small brush is nice, but only usable under the eyes, or in small areas. I use a larger, dense brush for all over application. the bottle lasts (for me) 4-5 months. * Its natural and mekts into my skin it dont even look like im wearing make up. Im caramel tan and b50 is a perfect match * I discovered this at the airport. Tried it on but didn't purchase it right then. I got to my gate and as I'm waiting for boarding I looked in the mirror by the window in natural daylight, it was flawless! I had to have it lol. So I walked/ran a 30 minute round trip back to the duty free from my gate to get this! That's how much I loved it. I've had it 2 months now, i wear it nearly every day and I'm about halfway through the bottle, a little goes a long way with this. Even though it's a thin consistency you think you need more, you really don't. (I'm 50 btw)"

I have an extremely hard time finding a match for my pale skin. Thank you soooo much! Buyer for life.. * Great makeup either an older people like me and they're 60s covers blemishes and age spots pretty well * Honestly it's pretty great! Color matched perfect and the application feels more like foundation w/ light coverage. I apply it with a beauty blender, finish with Elf hi-Def setting powder and I'm out the door! Try it for yourself :) * For a long time, instead of using foundation I used either Shape Tape or Born This Way where I need it most and would just blend it out onto my moisturizer.  This summer I developed some really bad sunspots and no matter how much corrector/concealer I'd use, my skin would look grey where the sun spots were.  One day, I tried this because I had gotten a sample and omg it has saved me!  I finally felt comfortable going out again without thinking everyone was staring at me.  The weird part was, it wasn't as heavy or full coverage as my concealer but worked 100x better.  Well, I'm finally at the end of that little tube and also, I now need a lighter color, so here I am.  

This CC cream is better than any other I've tried, it somehow has great coverage but looks incredibly soft and natural.  I'm also able to use it where I need it without seeing lines of demarcation.  This is most definitely an unsung hero and I'm baffled as to how it doesn't have a better rating. * I came in today looking for the tarte BB cream, but saw the cloud CC cream and went with it instead.  It matched well, covered great & has a light feel.  However, I got home and went on the tarte website only to discover it's already been discontinued.  😩 WHY?!? * I love Tarte.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NEVER EVER discontinue or reformulate. I am a customer for life and this foundation has changed my life. * very skin like finish! no fuss foundation. * This is an undetectable foundation on my mature, dry skin, though it can build easily for extra coverage. I will just add additional drops on those darker spots, which still peek through but look more homogenous. But coverage is not my main concern, so this winner maintains the slightly dewy glow over a well -prepped skin base, still looking un made-up by the end of the day. Also, goes over mineral sunscreen flawlessly. IMO it is on par with Haus Labs, Nars Radiant LIght, MUF reboot; my other favs. I am trying another shade, though am happy with Katey, the match I found via the skin models- so that's my recommendation for finding your shade, rather than the description. It is on sale, so... TRY IT! * I'm assuming this foundation is on clearance because of quality issues… I received my order and the formula is completely separated and cannot be mixed back together to a good consistency. * I was so surprised when i first used it, my skin looked like skin. I like a lightweight natiral finish and this gives me exactly that! It also stays on all day/night, only thing is that it oxidizes a little bit but not wnything drastic. Has been my go-to foundation for over a year already! * good match for hard shade (fair/light olive) and good for sensitive/acne prone/scar/texture skin. decent coverage but feels light and natural. but doesnt really set (makeup smudges on my cat) & taking the top off pulls the entire pump out sometimes * I have used this foundation for a few years and it's never let me down. I fluctuate between a range of their lighter, cool toned shades depending on the time of year. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. A few things I've learned along the way: 

*A thin base layer will cover most spots and uneven tones. If you need more coverage, then spot treat with a little more foundation.
*It pairs beautifully on top of Nudestix tinted sunscreen.
*Applies well with brushes or sponges, but better with your fingers.
*A stippling, dabbing motion is the best method to apply the thin layers.

I'm 41, and I receive many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation, and I feel like I look more youthful with this on. I will definitely continue to repurchase!"

Other foundations wear off or if I get sweaty then it comes off, but this one doesn't!! * This is a tinted moisturizer not makeup foundation. It provides minimal coverage & is not buildable. It does not have a radiant finish it is just wet; it stays wet and does not set even with powder. Shifts all days and settles into every line and patch. * I used to use Juice Beauty which I loved, but for some reason, Ulta decided not to carry it anymore. So, I had to find something else and decided to try Bare Minerals.The applicator was weird to start with - kind of jagged. The formula was very thick and sat on top of my skin. It never fully blended in and I looked like I was in the circus with cakey makeup. I returned it. * This is an amazing product. I was so happy to find something I really loved. Wirked great with my skin. But, now they no longer make my shade. Guess I have to find something else… Sucks! I Really loved this product. * I usually get the Bare Pro, but on a recommendation by a consultant at Ulta, I tried the serum. I am 50 and my skin is changing. This one is good for light coverage and is has a nice sheen to it that makes your skin look fresh. I will continue to use the Bare Pro for days that I want more coverage. But the serum is a nice change. * This product is somehow dry and greasy-looking at the same time... and  it was so runny I found it hard to work with. It has poor coverage and no matter what I tried I could not get it to stop settling/separating and emphasizing lines and texture. It looked so bad I had to return it."

It's so good on my skin with such a great coverage. My skin has not broken out and I will be repurchasing this product!! * I was hoping I would love this foundation as much as I love the concealer and I do!! I'm 70 years old been working on a happy medium, this by far has done that. Good coverage and Doesn't settle in creases * I have normal to dry skin and wore this foundation just 4 hours in and it begins to break up in my face. Primer, no primer, powder, setting spray, regardless of how I prep the skin this foundation does not last (I always do skin prep of course). Im not sure how this foundation has such a high rating, it's absolutely horrible and my skin isnt even that finicky. I have some minor blemish hyperpigmetation in my 30 year okd skin and some fine lines because we're all human. It breaks down, looks patchy, unblended and extremely cakey. 0/10 would not recommend. I never have done a review on a makeup product before because I can usually make it work to some degree, but I had to do a review on this one because its SO bad. * This item size is NOT worth the money. This is only .3 of an oz in size. This size is good if someone wants to try it out and wants to spend that money for it. This bottle will not last but maybe 3-4 full applications if that, for reference. I should have just bought the full size. * I ordered this on a sale where you buy one mini and get one free. They only sent me one and then when I contacted them refused to give me what I payed for. When I ordered it showed the buy one get two free in my cart. I wouldn't have paid this much money for one mini! I don't know if I will keep shopping at Ulta. I am seeing better deals other places and have spent so much money here when other places have bigger bottles for cheaper. * I'm very impressed with this product. The coverage is excellent but it feels very light on the skin. * I love Tarte  especially the shape tape foundation and concealer. I have used this in the past no problem,  this time it seemed dry and thick. I looked it up manufacturing date,  over six years ago! I don't understand why all Ulta is selling such old products?  I'm actually afraid to shop there now."

Very much like the Armani luminous silk foundation! highly recommed! * When are makeup companies going to stop putting FRAGRANCE in their products??? I read so many reviews and have seen this everywhere on the clock app and not a single one mentioned the fragrance. Partially my fault since I didn't read the ingredients like I usually do but everyone was hyping this product up. It wears beautifully and I don't even feel like I have anything on my face. However, I'm just not sure I can wear it due to the fragrance. Testing to see if the fragrance disappears after a bit. * It worked well for my skin. Im starting to have some fine lines and i enjoy this product . Also cannot wear heavy makeup anymore like i did in 2016 haha! But i like this. I dont love the perfuke scent to it though. Unless that had changed. * I never leave reviews but this one deserves all the love! My all time favorite foundation!!! Has the perfect amount of coverage while still looking like skin. * I am a big fan of Shelby Ann on Tik Tok & most of her favorite products have also been major hits for me… this on the otherhand was a gigantic miss. I would get more coverage and a better blend on my face with muddy water than this foundation. No matter what I did, how I prepped my skin, etc.- the foundation flat out would not work with me. I'm sure it probably is beautiful for some people that wanna take the time to make it work, but for me personally I have used 10x better foundations from brands like Wer N Wild and Elf that are cheaper and perform like a high end foundation. * Not too dewy and not heavy or dry
Just right for my combo skin * smooth, long lasting, hydrating and great for the price"

I love Revolution products! * After trying more expensive brands like Hourglass, Urban Decay, and IT Cosmetics, I'm still in love with Revolution Beauty 5 years later. It's a great value and applies easily with a sponge, brush, or fingers. Also, I have super dry skin in the winter, and it doesn't flake! * I have used this product since i was 16. Its got amazing coverage, and when i had acne it didn't accentuate it one bit. Now that Im in my mid 20s i still reach for it, it doesnt feel heavy and it lasts me all day. It has to do with technique too, on any foundation tbh, I prefer to build and blend until I get it just right. I love the applicator too. * I started using this foundation in 2022 and havent used a different once since! With acne (cystic) it easily applies and as long as you dont touch your face too much it lasts for hours! This product seriously changed my life. (I pair it with the Glow Watermelon moisturizer as a primer/base) . * When i applied it looked a little too pink for me, by the end of the day it got very cake-y and had gone very orange. I loved the price and texture at first but I think I will be stickinh with my tarte for now."

And concealer underneath is a must. * The online shade matching tool didnt work out well for me. Theres a very yellowish tint. That being said, the actual product is fine, feels lightweight enough. Landed up using a tan setting powder to offset the yellowness. * Very liquid consistency. I found it hard to blend since it stuck to dry patches and seemed to catch and pill. Not much coverage either. * I was looking for light coverage with SPF at Ulta. One of the employees put the product on me and it actually looks OK in store. I should've walked around and then rechecked it because it separates and is cakey on some areas of my face. I've made sure my face was clean/dry/smooth (I've done both laser, hair removal and electrolysis). I tried applying with a sponge, my fingers and with a brush. It always turned out terribly. The liquid is quite thin and leaks immediately when you open the top. So if you are not careful it will spill. I didn't even make it halfway through before giving up and throwing it away. What a waste of money. * Love this moisturizing skin tint.  And I love that its light as I'm not a foundation girl * Nice tint that provides godo coveragd. I use with a primer. * Love the product is usually hard to find a skin tent that is good for my complexion would definitely recommend a brown skin girls and who doesn't love a skin tint with SPF in it"

And easily blendable * i think its safe to say i can review this since ive had it for a year and its almost gone already. I honestly love power foundations. This one is very good quality and lightweight. If you have sensory issues and dont like the heavy feeling of a liquid foundation or concealer on your face all day, I recommend this for you. You dont even feel it like at all. Make sure you use a lightweight primer or something underneath to make it stick all day. * The powder makes me turn orange which i dont want. I even bought a shade lighter so i can get a lighter base near my eyes. Cute packaging but the formula is 2/10 * Good color but breaks easily * I would not buy this again.  It makes your skin look oily and way too dark for my complexion. * Not for me. I noticed when I put product on my skin it gets darker. So it oxidizes on me. This is better out there. * Feels like velvet super soft"
131,blk/opl,true color skin perfecting stick foundation spf 15,pimprod2022198,2579236," * This stick flotation is the truth. It doesn't feel like a mask when you put it on. It feels like almost nothing when you put it on and it has a skin like finish. Affordable price point for what you get and it's super blendable. I hope they never discontinue or change the formula. Truly love this foundation stick * From the exact color match, to the SPF, to the packaging… this is so good! Most days, I use this foundation lightly like a tinted moisturizer. When I'm going out, I can build it up to medium coverage and it doesn't cake. It looks so good. I've recommended this foundation 100x. * This brand is the only foundation with my perfect color match! There's no need to purchase multiple foundations to get my perfect color match, and the convenience of the stick and smoothness makes it beyond perfect to use on the go or not. The blending is perfect! * I love this product would totally buy again 💕 * I'm obsessed with this foundation stick and the SPF included in it! The shade match is perfect, the foundation is buildable and skin like and blends beautifully! 5 minute face or full beat it's amazing! * My perfect shade is Black Walnut which I can't find anywhere else. I love it! * This makeup is great! It applies easy and covers well while giving you the look of no makeup on. One of my new favorites! I am pretty fair skin and was nervous about the color but it looks great!"

I usually struggle with either foundation that makes me look ghostly or bordering on orange. Then I found this foundation. A game changer! Shade 650, Alexandria, is my perfect match! The coverage is perfect, goes on smooth and covers my pores and emerging wrinkles. Will definitely be repurchasing! A+++ and beyond! * I have been using this foundation for about a month now, and love the formula. It is medium-full coverage with a natural finish, and it lasts long. Plus, it does not cling to my dry skin nor does it make me break out (i have dry, sensitive, acne-prone skin). My only issue is that I use the lightest shade, and it is perfect when first applied but oxidizes to be slightly too orange on me. I would not reccommend this for anyone paler than myself. For reference, I also use their matte concealer in the shade J23, and it is a perfect match! * I used this to start my makeup journey and I love how light it feels like nothing is on my face & it gives a clean cute look. * I absolutely love this foundation. It's long-lasting and a little truly goes a long way, so you don't need much product for full coverage. The consistency is perfect—full coverage without feeling heavy or cakey on the skin. It wears beautifully throughout the day and still feels comfortable. The color match was spot on, and overall the performance exceeded my expectations. I'll definitely be repurchasing this foundation.🙂😇 * Like the product, but if skin has a potential of being oily..need a powder first then the Juvia for best results. * Literally my go to foundation for YEARS. It is so beautiful on the skin and a little goes a long way. I receive the best compliments when wearing this."
133,essence,16h cover & last powder foundation,pimprod2033174,2597553," * This product truly gives a soft, blurred effect as a powder. I apply lightly with a brush to my cheeks after I've applied my foundation and blush. Technically I apply to the area between the nose and cheeks where there is no blush. It doesn't work for me as a foundation because I prefer more coverage, but as a powder, I love it! I use the shade ""tan"" when I don't have a tan and it's perfect. I'm not dark or olive skin toned but it works great for me. Don't be fooled by the shade name. * Es super fácil de aplicar me encanta la cobertura y si dura y me encanta el color el precio es excelente me encanta esta marca de productos aparte es suave a mi tipo de piel que es sensible le cae muy bien lo recomiendo mucho I love it excelente producto. * Love this kind of foundation! It's easy to use and affordable! 💄💋 * My fav pressed powder foundation.  Gives me the light coverage that I want and for a great price * I tried this because i was sick of cream peoducts creasing and this is one million times better than all my other products. It stays all day at the office, doesnt break me out, looks flawless, and covers perfectly. Also takes 2 seconds to apply and powder puff and mirror are great for on the go touch ups. I live in Jackson, MS and this stays on all day in the sum
mer. * I saw a couple of online reviews recommending this, but my expectations were low considering the price point. I was surprised by how smooth and flawless my skin looked! I'm definitely a skincare rule-follower, so my skin was well prepped by my normal routine (exfoliation, moisturizer, primer). I didn't test the 16 hour claims, but I can attest to 7 or 8 hours of flawless looking skin.  It does have a little bit of scent, but that seemed to fade pretty quickly. * Easy to apply, it gives you medium coverage that looks like your skin. It's matte and perfect fie combo skin. Everything sits beautifully on top of the foundation. Its a great product for the price."

The cream to powder is perfect, its so lightweight and you can make the coverage as light or full as you want. It bkends like a dream and the color match was spot on. Would definitely recommend! * I absolutely love the cream to powder foundation. It provides full coverage but doesn't feel heavy on the skin. I would buy over and over again. * I have been wanting to try this foundation for a while,  as I love some of the other Milani products, but one of the drawbacks is it can only be purchased online. I finally ordered it and it's ok. I took a quiz to see which color I should order since I've never ordered it before. Again it's only available online, so I can't go test the shades in the store. I am usually an ivory shade in other brands so I got the 220 creamy natural. When it came in, my first reaction was ""oh no"" my fear of ordering the wrong shade came true as the foundation looked really dark and orange. Since I already had it, I decided to test it anyway knowing full well it would not match, but it sort of did end up matching. The dark orange color was just like a film and it was lighter underneath and it blends really well. It feels really lightweight and breathable. It almost feels like you aren't even wearing make up, which makes sense since I found it to be very light coverage. I was hoping for medium to full coverage, but it just evened my skin out like a BB cream would do. I would still recommend it for the price, but wouldn't compare it to the KVD as that's how it was promoted to me. * I took the shade match quiz, the shade was way too light and when applied looks cakey and clings to dry patches. * I got this foundation in the lightest shade and its still too dark and orange. It cakes extremely bad even with two lifht layers. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone! * The cream-to-powder formula is fantastic! I use it alone (no concealer, highlighter, bronzer, blush) and it works great to cover up my acne scars and even out my complexion. However, I have noticed that it breaks me out really badly. I wish there was a clean formula for this type of product. * Right texture for me"
136,smashbox,mini halo healthy glow tinted moisturizer broad spectrum spf 25,pimprod2033372,2596512," * This is a moisturizing BB/CC/tinted moisturizer with some bonus SPF. It is great for mature skin that gets dry and dehydrated from most foundations. I really like being able to just put some on with my fingers over SPF and get some nice coverage and evening out of redness. It does not emphasize pores or dry patches. I use it like a tinted moisturizer, so I just apply and don't really blend it in, lol, and it looks fine. I also don't powder it and I don't expect to stay perfectly in place all day. I really like using this because it's a thin, light additional layer of SPF, and I know I've only applied a thin first layer of SPF 50, so it's a little insurance SPF. My super-sensitive skin simply cannot handle the recommended glob of first layer SPF no matter what the formula is, so I can only do a thin layer of it, and then I add the Halo Tinted Moisturizer with SPF25.

PS. My skintone is fair-light with yellow/green undertones (Nars Gobi and Urban Decay Light Cool Green) , and I've used multiple tubes of Halo in shade Light. * I have super dry, super sensitive skin. this  covers redness, blends well, doesnt look cakey, doesn't cause breakouts (which i only wear full make up about twice a week) I still usually apply a moisturizer beforehand. maybe wouldn't recommend for oily skin * I keep coming back to this because my dry skin LOVES it. I have yet to find another base product that sits as well as this does on my skin. It's a shame that the shade just isn't quite right. I am very fair with a pink undertone, and the lightest shade is a little too orange. It also oxidizes a bit so if I don't blend my jawline well, the contrast is noticeable. This gives me such a healthy glow and doesn't exaggerate my dry patches like other foundations/tinted base products do. It's the perfect coverage I'm looking for too. I don't think I'm the only person wishing for more cool/olive options! * Makes me feel greasy every time :'( * I have been searching for years for a light coverage product that will just even out my skin tone without feeling heavy at all. I am really particular about my facial products and any kind of makeup- if it feels heavy at all, I won't continue to use it. this product is perfect for me! I have again, dry 40 year old skin. I do my skin care and apply this right after my moisturizer and it evens me out beautifully while allowing my skin to breathe! I wear light neutral shade and there's zero orange undertone. I can't feel the product on my face, it just feels like part of my skin care routine. it also contains SPF which is a huge plus as well. wears perfectly all day long without making me greasy at all, which tends to happen with all foundations I've tried. this covers all my redness which is exactly what I need. no breakouts and no scent. please never stop making this! * It was on clearance and I see why. If you have acne prone skin run the other direction from this product. I tried twice before realizing this was the root of my end of day flare ups!!! It did not take long for it to form cysts. * now that I'm in my 40s, my skin is changing. it's more dry and my pores are bigger, in addition to having discoloration from previous years of tanning and no SPF. I was looking for something very lightweight that I can't feel, that contains SPF and also evens out my skin tone while adding some glow. a tall order, but this product full the bill in full! I tried it without putting on moisturizer first, and I wouldnt recommend that. it wasn't quite moisturizing enough to stand on its own for me. so if you are drier, definitely moisturize first then apply right away. the glow is beautiful but not at all greasy. it blended right in with no tool needed, and my cream blush went on over it perfectly. didn't feel heavy at all either. in fact I forgot id put it on at all after a half hour or so. it evened out my skin tone beautifully while allowing my freckles to show through a little too. love it!"

Even with bronzing drops my face was a pink tone not what i had in mind considering im a naturally light tanned skin person and i live in FL. its def a heavy formula and a little goes a very long ways. After it dried out my skin even with my normal face routine i stopped using it. Wish they would listen to their consumers and change the formula. * I love this product but I feel the appearance of the bottle is very misleading. You think you are getting a full bottle, but it is really only half full and when you are done, so much is wasted on the sides of the bottle that does not come out.. I do not feel I am getting my money's worth or this would have been a 5 star review. My service at Ulta was amazing, very pleased. I have called the make-up company and expressed my feelings on their packaging and presentation. * i have combo oily skin and i wear fair shades with neutral undertones. this foundation was great for mattifying my face and has great coverage with just shy of a full pump. however, there's a bizarre scent that seems to linger for awhile. normally, scent doesnt bother me too much, but something about this smelled really bad. the fair neutral shade unfortunately just looked very grey and unflattering on me, and bronzing drops didnt seem to help much. if they fixed the undertones & the scent of this product, this would be an easy five stars * im in love with this! i have super oily skin and it went on so smooth and super matte! only bad thing about it is its pink toned even on the ""golden"" shades but its a quick fix with the LA girl pro color foundation pigment in yellow just add a tad bit to your foundation shade and bingo!!! you have your perfect shade! * undertone does not maych.. its PINK.. its thick, SUPER pink, literally nothing can help it not be pink, has a scent and while it does cover, and i can get over the scent, i just cant get over the undertone, PASS * My favorite full coverage foundation. * So I was told by one of the old workers that this company is under the umbrella of Tarte, and with the outstanding quality of this, I can definitely tell. I am an extremely discerning consumer. And I have combination, oily skin, acne prone, so I am a great barometer for quality. This foundation has been my #1 for the past few years. If you're looking for something that blurs pores, is full coverage, mattifies beautifully, and you do look like a real life filter— this is your foundation! Absolutely amazing. 20 out of 10 stars.

140,juvia's place,i am magic glow radiance booster,pimprod2044250,2620803," * I love this product. If you've tried ELF Halo Glow liquid filter, this is that but better. It has slightly more coverage than ELF while still being sheer enough to look like you're not wearing foundation. It's very radiant but looks more natural than ELF which was a little too glowy for me. Only complaint it that sometimes it can get streaky if you apply too much product. Just apply less product or bounce a sponge over your face and it's an easy fix! I love this for when I want to even my skin tone out and add some radiance without putting on a full face. Will definitely repurchase as it's become a staple for me now and is very budget friendly! * My Shade: 0.5
I can wear this alone or with foundation and it looks VERY SKIN LIKE. It makes your skin looks very even and hydrated. * Easy to apply and control coverage amount. Very nice natural finish. Great for everyday (no makeup makeup days), but not as long lasting as other radiance foundations. * It does not give you pimples. Yes it gives you a Dewey look glowing. I was using Mac before and did not realize how much harsh chemicals that were in it that messes with your hormones and can give you issues down the road I have red pigmentation.takes it away * This is great if you want something light but looking to have a beautiful, smooth glow. Makes your skin look healthy and balanced.  If you are oily I suggest setting with a powder and use a matte setting spray.  When i want a makeup look i use their powder foundation to set.  Great for the summer or just a natural look. * Great product! * Loved it"

Including any dry skin and did not cover well at all. I wanted to really like it but it didn't work for me * I love this foundation, its like your own skin but better. * At this price I'm pretty disappointed. Color match was great and does not oxidize, but that's where the pros ended for me. Definitely not full coverage, didn't blend well and shifts/splotchy. If you're an oilslick like me… this is a total waste. Maybe good for dryer skin? Going back to Dior at this price point and won't be purchasing this one again. * This foundation brought out texture and wrinkles I have never seen before. It is not very blend-able, as it takes a lot of manipulation to look somewhat acceptable. This product is very drying and I have oily skin. Not to mention it does not adhere to the skin, it slips and sides off your face throughout the day leaving you patchy. * I finally found my holy grail foundation, I didn't even buy it at Ulta but that's how much I loved it to write a review. It feels like I'm wearing nothing, it matches my skin perfectly which has been a nightmare for years trying to find a good match. * This coverage is a lot more sheer and dewy than I had anticipated. This would be a beautiful foundation for someone with dry, mature skin since it does not crease. The colors are not accurate either. I suggest ordering one to two shades darker. * I need to keep looking. I have a full bottle that I hope to find someone that it works for."

I bought it again recently for my natural ""no makeup days"" for a quick sheer cover up for my acne marks. It is a nice foundation for people who want a light to medium coverage. Definitely not full coverage. Although its good, i think there are much better options out there. This foundation can be very greasy, so if you have oily skin, be sure to set it and touch it up throughout the day. It also applies very streaky. The applicator makes putting it on very quick and easy, but since it can be very streaky, blotchy, and greasy, youll have to spend extra time blending it and setting it. 

This product was great when i was younger but i wouldn't repurchase now. * I'm 50 and have used foundations at every price point from drugstore to luxury. This is my favorite (I'm buying my second bottle) because it doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything on my skin. It covers well without being heavy or cakey. I use it as my concealer as well. I would prefer pump packaging because with the twist-up you can't gauge how much you're dispensing, but I can get past that. Great, unsung foundation! * Great job on covering the blemishes. * I am picky about color shades and there is Many colors to choose from * It worked like a greasy highlighter on my face, highlighted flaws I didn't know i had.

It feels so nourishing and applies so evenly. It's light yet gives a good medium coverage. A great summertime weight. Not heavy but yet just enough color. Love it. Buy it. Give it a try. I think you'll like it. * This foundation is so perfect for me. It blends perfectly into my skin. It's so easy to apply. I just dab it on with a beauty sponge and I'm done in minutes! 
I love it ❤️ * I'm not sure why my skin reacts to foundation so terribly, but even the luxury brands make me look a little off. I know my undertone and have been able to pinpoint my exact color profile, so it's not that. Foundation usually sits on top of my face, amplifies my fine lines, and makes me look like a hot mess. Age Perfect Tinted Balm is the only foundation that makes me look better, and I wish I knew about it sooner. It's my favorite! * I have what the skincare industry refers to as ""mature ""skin. I am a make junkie and I had many foundations from drugstores and major department stores but as I got older they all made me look cake and settled into lines. I stumbled on this product and I love it. It's my skin only better. It lasts almost all day on my  combination oily dry skin. It is a wonderful product with light medium coverage for mature skin. Will definitely buy again * I've used 3 pots of this now and I'm still somehow surprised by how nice it is. The formula feels like it won't cover much, but it softens the appearance of/seems to fill and even out pores, scars, wrinkles, or any textures--I often get compliments on how smooth my skin looks when I use this. I've gone back and forth between two colors because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the color match is a little difficult. All in all, I keep trying new foundations just to come back to this one and be impressed by it. * I'm a light-medium skin tone that leans towards cool. I got started on this because an influencer raved about it a few yrs. ago. I decided to try it and couldn't had been more thrilled. I use shade fair 20 for reference. In the pot it looks more like a peach shade. It glides on effortlessly and melts into my skin. My dry/mature skin looks healthy. I'm sure I will get tired of this foundation, but for the last 3 yrs. I've been pleased. Only time will tell. * I was very skeptical to try this and was shocked. It is so good. 47 year old combo skin, apply with real techniques dense brush and its better than high end. How is this not more popular?"
145,hourglass,illusion hyaluronic skin tint,pimprod2020463,2575960," * I expected to love this based on reviews I'd seen, but for me, it applied very thick, sat noticeably in pores (an issue I've never had with any other product) and fine lines and didn't do anything it claims to do. I actually found it quite drying. I love HG products and am so glad Ulta is carrying them. I hope they'll carry the newer HG skin tint so I can try that one. * Im 55 and my skin is very dry, this product is moisturizing and never settles in my pores , an excellent alternative to foundation which just sat on my skin, this tinted moisturizer does not do that. I would highly recommend this product- * I have never had so many compliments about my skin since using this tinted moisturizer! It may not be for anyone needing full coverage makeup but someone looking for a glow and slight coverage! * It was very hard to find something for my aging skin that is full coverage, but doesn't settle into lines and look caked on. this was recommended in store and I absolutely love it! I apply with a beauty blender and use shape tape concealer with a tiny bit of setting powder. Really makes a difference being hyaluronic and any pictures while wearing come out great. A must in my drawer. * I wanted to like this. I have dry skin and some creepiness at 52. This made all of that worse.

It's very thick and kinda hard to blend out even with moisturizer and primer. 
I had to return this and buy the Too Faced brand hydrating liquid foundation. * Several comments said this was medium to full coverage which made me want to try it and it is not. There is absolutely no coverage at all. If anything it's just a glorified moisturizer so I'm thinking those other comments were for a different product. * Absolutely one of my favorite foundation. I love how it leaves my skin glowing and hydrated!"
146,jane iredale,refillable compact,pimprod2031651,2595249," * Tried to purchase this compact in the 21 Days of Beauty promotional, but couldn't add it to my cart, was it sold out?  Imagine my surprise the following day when it was available again at full price. Bait and switch advertising...not cool. * The discontinued gold compact was perfectly thin and light weight, making it easy to carry everyday. Also great for touch-ups when mineral foundation SPF is needed out in the sun! The closing latch wasn't super secure but I never had a problem with it opening in my purse. The new design is thick and super heavy. It's beautiful to sit on a counter, but useless weight for travel or carried in a shoulder bag. So sad I never odered backs up of the slim gold-tone compact! * I was surprised how expensive this compact is. But I have had so many contacts break and then I get crumbled pressed powder. This one looks like it will hold up well. I will let you know the first time I drop it-Yikes! * Very happy with this new compact. My JI mineral foundation stores securely,  the compact opens easily and now has a mirror. Yay! * I am a loyal Jane Iredale brand user. In fact, I have been using their products for over 20 years. The Jane Iredale line was recommended to me by the surgeon who did facial reconstruction after skin cancer surgery. 

Although I love their products, I have always been ""ehh"" about their packaging....until now! Thanks for finally giving up the gaudy gold (sorry, Jane Iredale) and going with this new, modern and aesthetically pleasing line of packaging. Since I have several of the old gold compacts, including the gold metals ones, I ordered one of the new compacts to see how I would like it. After receiving the new compact, I cannot wait to replace ALL my older versions! 

One more suggestion... in your future development, please consider making your eye shadows available in refills. I love the idea of being kinder to our planet and saving on the excess packaging. I do not mind paying separately for the cases if I know if is making a smaller, greener impact for future generations. =)

One final note of thanks to Ulta...I have been begging my local store to start carrying Jane Iredale. I am glad to see that you are at least finally carrying this amazing, clean line of makeup online! * I bought this on sale and I'm glad I did. It just makes it nice to put your foundation in. For the price of the foundation, it's a shame you have to purchase compact separately. * This packaging is overpriced and by default should be included with the powder. Waste of money."
147,nudestix,tinted cover foundation,pimprod2008837,2552723," * Overall I really like this product. I have sensitive skin and eczema, but this does not irritate my skin. The only thing I dislike is the initial smell when first applied - it has a strange medicinal smell. The smell goes away 15-20 minutes after application but it's strong when first applied. If this product was truly fragrance free I would give it 5 stars. * I have been upping my skin care regiment to combat hormonal acne and hyperpigmentation so my skin has been looking very nice. Thats where this product shines! It's very hydrating and lightweight so it looks like radiant skin! * I actually love this foundation bc i have blemish free skin and us it to even out hyperpigmentation. The issue is the pump… it does not pull product well after tube is no longer full and it doesn't come off. So its just wasted product. * Of course it doesn't fully cover blemishes, its not full coverage. I buy this again & again & pair it with concealer for under eyes / blemishes , & blush. Its so smooth, never breaks out my acne prone skin. I love it so much!! * Honestly I hate foundation, I have super sensitive skin and anything can break me out easily. This foundation is SO NICE!! It is more like a skin tint than a foundation, which I prefer if I do ever wear it, the smell is relaxing (if you're not an essential oil person I wouldn't recommend, the lavender is pretty strong), and it doesn't feel like anything is on. For my Florida girls this stuff is a great quick fix for the hot and humid days!! * I have super sensitive, rosacea-prone skin & my eyes are really easily irritated by makeup (ocular rosace) that started a few years ago - suddenly I couldn't wear my favorite makeup without breaking out, & my eyes burning, bright red. I searched & finally found a brand specifically for rosacea-prone skin! So happy to be able to wear makeup again! Over the last year or so the formula clearly changed - I couldn't find a color match & then my eyes started to  burn again. Back to the search - finally found this - I love this foundation & the whole product line! It's light & looks great - as others have said, I look like myself, only better! It doesn't settle in my lines or pores, doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It does feel a bit oily / has a bit of shine. Also, Nude 3 is a perfect color match for me when it goes on, but it does darken a bit across the day so I'm going to try 2.5 & save 3 for the summer. Otherwise, highly recommend!! * I bought this foundation and love it.  I'm 47 years old with dry and pigmented skin from aging and I like light coverage products due to aging skin look more natural than full coverage foundation.  Very moisturizing.  I still set with loose powder and yes would buy this as long as nudestix still made this."

My thought was to return one of them.  However, the finish for both is beautiful, applied with a beauty sponge it gives a soft matte glow to my 61 year old complexion.  It gives health and vitality.  I tend to use the warm finish more often, however the neutral is just as beautiful on the skin.  After an 8 hour day of wearing the foundation, it looks great!  Definitely recommended especially at the sale price worth every penny. * SAVE YOUR MONEY! * I bought this foundation because I heard that UOMA was going away and now I wish it wasn't because this is liquid GOLD. It looks like SKIN and the shade is perfect for my pale olive toned skin. I love this so much!!! * I was so impressed with the color matching. This matched perfectly. Unfortunately, it was pretty watery. After a lot of shaking, it seemed to dispense properly, but the formula is pretty thick. It dries almost instantly and makes blending difficult. I also felt that it emphasized fine lines and wrinkles on my very dry skin. * overall the wear of the foundation wasn't bad, but my skin was red and inflamed when I took it off and I don't typically have sensitive skin and this was the only thing different in my routine * I like this brand and what little of this foundation I put on my face went on smooth and dried well. but it smelled so awful I couldn't use it! I didn't see reviews that mentioned the smell so I'm wondering if I got an old/bad batch…which would also be concerning. Disappointed but returning this"
150,j.cat beauty,aquasurance compact foundation,pimprod2000221,2550026," * This is the BEST powder foundation. When i need my make up to be quick but look like i spent way more time on it this is the answer. It blends into the skin so naturally and gives me nice coverage without feeling powdery or cakey. I have probably gone through 4-5 of these compacts! It does shatter easily so be careful with that. * I don't understand all the rave reviews about this product. It is patchy and doesnt cover anything! * amazing foundation for when I'm in a rush. I have oily skin but am on retinol so a light layer of this foundation works better than my other foundations. it can cake up if you use to many layers and don't prep correctly. I did wish they had a better shade range. * I have gone through 4 or 5 of this foundation! So easy to apply and sets beautifully with a setting spray * This is my favorite powder foundation formula and has been for years - goes on so smoothly and is buildable. The last few compacts I've bought have cracked from barely any use. I had to dump the powder into a different container and use it that way. * so I do a full face every day. every once in a while I'll ""cheat"" and use this product to save time. it works sooo well. I use a light shade which I chose by pretty much matching my neck/highlight areas and use it mainly in my T zone. highlighting under eyes, forehead between brows chin and then I also add it along my jawline. then I go about my routine as normal but without the need for foundation highlight and baking. saves so much time! it builds well and has amazing coverage. it lasts all day. I have mature skin and hate when things settle into fine lines and wrinkles and I do not have that problem with this. it actually makes my skin appear younger compared to my full face routine with baking etc. I know I hav to find a new foundation to help avoid it but who has the time lol anyway... YES. this product is one I want to hoard in case it ever goes away. it's amazing. I use it with a compact dense brush. 

only downside is that I broke 2... but it's because I throw it in my purse and I know that's not ideal and on me for being careless. but if it's getting tossed around, be aware the powder may break. * This is a must have in my kit! I use it to lightly set my foundation and it transforms my face! I have also used it as a powder foundation for summer days and it is flawless!"
151,revlon,illuminance skin-caring foundation,pimprod2036478,2605534," * This is better than expensive brand that claims to be skin caring. Does not oxide. I also find color matching my skin is challenging, but I found a shade that perfectly matches me in this line. * I love this foundation, I'm on my third or fourth bottle! I like that it is paraben free, affordable, has beautiful natural looking medium coverage, is hydrating, and actually has shades that match my medium yellowy-olive skin tone.
It looks like my bare skin but more even. I can't speak to the longevity because I don't really pay attention to that, haha. 
Yes it does totally smell like what you would paint your wall with! I'm willing to put up with it for an affordable paraben free option that actually matches my skin. * I love this and would buy it again... only a shade lighter. * Got this foundation about 2 weeks ago… just don't even look into this product. Maybe l'm having bad luck but it smells like paint, it creases SO EASILY I have to powder my face immediately after just to avoid it and then it STILL creases. The foundation comes off way to

152,dior,forever natural matte velvet compact foundation,pimprod2045605,2625554," * Lifelong CD makeup user. Never write reviews. Was devastated when Airflash was discontinued. This product is AMAZING. Literally just set it in my skin with a damp beauty blender and feel like just this and mascara can take me through the day. Literally just use it on its own and it looks amazing. No primer, no setting spray etc. Definitely try! * In fairness, I have used only loose powders for over 15 years- so I am used to a more sheer look. I typically love Dior products and the reviews made me think it could work. Definitely not for me. I am in my early 40's and this set right into every wrinkle on my face and just looked flaky. Returned and went back to loose powder."

But I worry about talc as an ingredient, given it's link to cancer. * I haven't experienced peeling, but very dry. I found no moisturizing properties. * this dried my skin. I tried it using a sponge and with my fingers and almost instantly dried on my face making it very flakey. unless I was using it incorrectly... I would not purchase again * I was looking for a light skin tint/tinted moisturizer. I picked this up and tried it out. It started flaking off my face as I was putting it on. I tried to add lotion to it, but eventually just wiped it off because if kept peeling * I was excited to try this because the color is nice and I never find shade matches. The claims were cool too— skincare focus!

However, no matter the prep or primer or brush or sponge or tool or skincare or whatever mix of things.. it pills and pills.

154,revlon,illuminance serum tint,pimprod2042614,2618859," * I decided to try this based on a review by an influencer and I am glad I did! This is super light - ""your skin but better"" kind of product which is exactly what I go for when I do my makeup. It gives you a fresh look with a dewy finish but not overly shiny. I was able to find the perfect shade which is super exciting. Seems that most brands tend to offer a lot of cool and warm tones but not many neutral options. Shade # 313 was a great match! * Moisturize well but it's beautiful. Covers redness, sun spots. Pretty impressive for drugstore! * sigh * I fell in love with this tint. I have tried so many from Ulta, from the drugstores and I will tell you ... it's exactly what it reads.... it's a SERUM with Tint ! Not a tint with serum !! big difference. This product is more skin than makeup. Get it !! * At first I liked this tint, but the more I used it I noticed how streaky, oily, and cakey it looks. I have dry skin but it's so sticky no matter how much I set it with powder. Also, there's literally no coverage. Obviously it's a skin tint but there should at least be some coverage. It also burns a little as others have stated. * After trying many skin tints, I came back to this one. With maturing skin, it instantly evens skin tone and leaves a youthful glow. It works well with powders and creams. It doesn't settle into any fine lines and feels so light weight. I barely feel like I have anything on my face. This has turned into my favorite foundation especially just in time for summer! * Seems to give a healthier glow!"
155,covergirl,clean fresh skin milk foundation,pimprod2011577,2556836," * I have sensitive skin and it made me break out in little red dots. Looks like I have a rash on my face. No thanks. If I have to buy an expensive product to keep myself from breaking out, so be it. * I wanted to share my experience with the CoverGirl foundation because it really didn't go well for me. I was excited to try it after hearing some good reviews, and at first, it went on smoothly and looked fine. But within a few hours, my skin started to feel weird kind of itchy and tight, especially around my cheeks and jawline. By the end of the day, my face had broken out in little red bumps, and my skin was noticeably red and irritated. The next morning, it was even worse. My face felt raw, especially around my mouth and nose, and it looked like I had a mild sunburn. On top of that, my skin became incredibly dry and flaky, which never happens to me. I had to stop using all my regular skincare products because everything just stung. It's been a few days now and I'm still trying to calm my skin down. I don't usually react to makeup like this, so I was honestly pretty shocked. If you have even slightly sensitive skin, I'd be really cautious with this foundation. Definitely do a patch test first I wish I had. * Just so so. I wouldn't go out of my way to re purchase it again. It's super runny and it broke me out a little bit. I don't usually break out or have sensitive skin. I don't like the smell either. * This creamy foundation applies smoothly and evenly while blending with my choices of concealer (yay! doesn't seem to matter which brand). * This broke me out the worst I've ever seen it gave me huge painful cystic acne :( the coverage was pretty good but it has an odd smell. * I love that first and foremost its cruelty free, I think vegan too. It's affordable and so pigmented. I have oily skin but with the right orimer this does wonders. Try using the pink wet n wild primer. Coverage is amazing and LONG LASTING. ALL DAY (well at elast 10/12hrs) Please never discontinue it * This is the one for me. It has medium coverage on me , it doesnt look cakey. I love how long it lasts and makes my skin look fresh dewy but not oily and shiny. It pairs well with my lawless concelear and all my powders. I truly hope they never get rid of this line. I have stocked up on my shade 570"
156,covergirl,trublend matte made liquid foundation,pimprod2000386,2533518," * I use the foundation daily and I would definitely recommend to someone who's on a tight budget. only thing is it is easily transferable and doesn't stay on variable. It also looks a bit cakey but i highly recomend spraying do we setting spray onto your brush/sponge, and then blending out. * I normally wear Estee stay matte foundation but I was out and until it arrived I needed something in the meantime. I wore this out, was standing in the parking lot talking to my friends and some random lady walked up to us and said ""sorry to interupt but I just have to tell you, you are stunning"" ( she was talking to me) And then she walked off. I was never told that when I wore the Estee! What the heck, this stuff is GOLD. * I have been using this foundation for 5 years now. I will say it is not full coverage but it is buildable. This foundation feels so lightweight & it gives such a natural look. I've tried other foundations but always come back to this one cause its just so good! I tend to have an oily T-zone & everywhere else is pretty much dry but this foundation doesn't ever really cake or flake on me. I 100% recommend this foundation for an everyday natural look! * I love this foundation! it's affordable and stays on all throughout the work day * this foundation is surprisingly good for the price. it's buildable, smooth, and has a nice matte but natural finish. it flaked on my chin area after a few hours, but that could be my skin type. * Love this for my combo skin. I'm not extremely oily but I needed something that would actually last throughout the day without needing to powder by midday. I actually like it better than the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I am shade 090 in Lancome but have not been able to find a good color match as 090 is too light and the next shades are too dark and orange. I have very fair neutral skin. I prefer how the covergirl looks, it is very smooth with slightly better coverage, and L20 is a great shade and a closer match than the Lancome (maybe L20 is a dash too light but it looks perfect after bronzer). It gives a natural matte finish that doesn't cling or look cakey. Works well on my middle-age skin with fine lines. Has great medium-full coverage. Highly recommend! * I really love this foundation and I will continue to purchase it! Affordable and covers well."

159,essence,keep me covered long-lasting foundation,pimprod2037417,2603112," * i discovered this foundation a few years ago mainly because it was super cheap. turns out the price is pretty self explanitory because this foundation should be named ""keep her covered in some places but not others"" its super patchy. it could work in a pinch though. i mainly use it for photo shoots since its cheap and i can always buy more. the patchiness isn't very visible on camera which is why i do that. but as long as i'm alive that will never be on my face in public. * Good product & price. * I wish I was being dramatic because I really like the formula and how light it feels on my face, the one I got is my perfect natural shade when first applied. but when it dried down. tell me why I was literally orange?!? and I thought maybe oh I could've gotten the wrong shade. (second guessing myself) I went a sister shade lighter and It was a little less noticeable but it still made me yellowish orange so I mixed it with a different foundation to see what would happen and it fixed the issue for me but for those that wanna know by itself it shifts color when dry but it's still a light smooth waterproof formula.. 
might I add,  what might not work for me might work better for you, it's always best to mess around and find out * This is honestly a really good sheer foundation. Its not full coverage but percect for the summer needing something lightweight. Shade match was surprising good. I would definitely buy again * Not good. Coverage is pretty bad. Watery. Dont buy * Great product * Great for the price but doesn't stay all day but the shades are great they just need more for other skin tones."

It feels extremely velvety. It is matte without being drying, which is also hard to do without talc. Hoping that they bring this back. You can use it as a powder foundation and a tinted setting powder. There is something spectacular about this formula. Really hope Elf brings this back. * After seeing many amazing reviews, I came here, excited to try this. But sooo much disappointed when there is no shade available for me, not even a close shade. * So overall if say its a good product if your a oily skin and combination skin then its pretty good buttt the shade range needs work it goes from a fair skin shade to a tan walnut color so id say maybe add more shadess ! BUT I DO LOVE HOW THEY INCLUDED DEEPER SKIN TONES * This works so well for my skin when I want to beaty ""filter"" my face. But this is noy for dry skin. * It broke the second I tapped my brush on it. Then it was impossible to blend out on my face and ruined my makeup ): * I love this powder this is the best powder that I have discovered as of lately. Elf kills it with all the products they release but this is top tier. * I really wanted to like this product, but even though I moisturize my skin, it leaves randow streaks on my face, as if i applied it with a paint brush. And leaves weird marks on my nose that I cant blend out and have to literally use my nails to scratch off. I have oily skin and never experienced this with a powder foundation."

It's pure white and awful. * Smelled horrible right out of the tube.  Bought just to mess around and imediately threw away.  Would not recomend to anyone, ever. * I bought this for a lighter highlight effect. It's to thick and cakes hard to blend. * This is ultimately is not bad for the price but the shade I got dud not match the screen I ordered it from so.... and honestly makes you have texture really badly. But it is great if you use it for concealer instead. * Bought on clearance just to mess around.  (Three shades so I could try contours.). Smells too terrible to even do that.  I have never theown away makeup I just bought before this.  I know it is on clearance but it should not be sold at all. * I loveeeeeeee this foundation! It gives me the full coversge that i need"

I live in Italy and was introduced to this brand by one of my girlfriends.All of their stuff is amazing. This foundation is great but definitely runs a bit warmer than I expected. I'm usually light neutral or 35N and grabbed shade 30N, it was darker than expected and waaaay too yellow on me. * I love this foundation * I was hesitant at first ,because I just heard from this brand but I'm glad i gave it a try. And it was on sale 😁 felt good on my face. I used it and yes it was worth it the staying power  was good specially of your from az. * Have a hard time matching foundation to my skin tone and this matches me perfectly. It looks natural and has buildable coverage. For the price, you cannot beat it, I own foundations double the price and this is now my go to. Give it a shot. :D * I bought this like a month ago and I love it! You dont have to use a lot and literally your face is flawless. One of the things i love about this product is it doesnt dry out your skin. I got the shade neutral 25 and id say that its a mix of fair and tan. I also really love the application part of it, the wand is really nice!!! * Covers a lot without having to apply a ton. Love the application wand * I love this foundation I find myself reaching for it more  often than the others. it's not drying, not greasy,  the coverage looks like my skin but glowy, and not cakey. The kiko Milano powder is awesome too for baking BTW. This foundation is way very similar to TF Born this way foundation, (but not as greasy) kiko milano is underrated IMO. Yes I would recommend."
164,well people,bio stick foundation,pimprod2008575,2553269," * The old formula truly was the best, I looked forward to applying it every morning.  Blended like a dream, gorgeous satin finish, blurred imperfections, clean and fragrance free.  The color 1C was actually a cool tone, this new 1C is PEACH toned....very warm, and the formula change truly makes me sad....it's not the same. They ruined a perfect product. * I absolutely love this product! The smell is a bit strong and the application is a little off-putting, but it blends great and looks great! I found that instead of using a traditional primer like elf power grip, using a setting spray to prime made application easier and blending smoother. * My skin looked worse with this. Highlighying pores no matter how much or how many different methods i use. And shows every bump, dry patch, etc. its so weird. Like the opposite of why we wear makeup in the first place. So mad i was fooled that im writing a review * I have very fair and pink skin and have always had trouble finding foundations that match my tone, never mind work well on my oily/combination skin, but I will say that this one does a good job! I was nervous buying online without match testing, but I got the 1C and would say its a pretty good match for my skin tone. 

My pros for this are definitely: generaly matches my skin, works well with my oily/combination skin, it coming in a stick format is very convenient and mess free, stays on very well, looks natural, and doesnt make my skin feel gross

My cons would be: not the perfect match (wish the undertones were more p and that the shade was slightly lighter), can get a little cakey if i put too much on, and a little hard to blend. 

For context I've been wearing Too Faced Born this way foundation in the shade Snow for years now because it's the only foundation I've found that comes close to matching my skin, but I've always run into the same problem of not being able to apply the foundation too thick because then you can tell it's not a true match. Anyway, I would say overall thi one does a better job, has better ingredients, feels better on my skin, and is a good price point.

My last points would be dont let the 1 star reviews scare you, this foundation is very nice and as long as you use a wet sponge to apply and don't mind the mild scent of castor oil that fades in about 30 minutes :) * The old formula was amazing.  Shade 1C was a perfect cool tone as described.  This newer version is very peach in tone and no longer qualifies as cool toned.  So  if you are a fair, cool toned person...look elsewhere. * I have come back to this product again and again after trying other hydrating foundations that are too thin and messy or settle into pores. This is my favorite non-SPF foundation. It is like a natural version of cover girl compact makeup. It's vegetable oil based so it does smell like olive oil. But it's so nourishing and convenient with the solid stick. It smooths on well to a medium coverage and natural dewy finish that doesn't settle into my pores or cause breakouts for me. And with a light powder to set, it stays all day. I do wish they had lighter shades as the lightest warm (2W) is a bit dark for me in winter. But I'm a repeat customer of this good clean dry skin foundation option. * This brand is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I live in the desert and ingredients like hyaluronic acid just pull the water out of your skin because there's no water in the air here. It seemed like every make up and skincare brand hopped on that train and I couldn't find anything for my skin (dry) and climate type. I hope they never change the formula! I'm almost 30 and I'm starting to get crows ft etc and this really does a great job of camouflage without settling in any wrinkles."

It was easy to blend and didnt make me feel cakey or end up patchy at the end of the day. It evened my skin tone out very nicely! My boyfriend didnt even know I was wearing makeup but I felt like I still got the coverage/effect I was going for. Definitely recommend trying it out! * I use this everyday! Lightweight yet covers what it needs to * it creases
168,kvd beauty,lock-it foundation,pimprod2018138,2570570," * Coverage is amazing.  I can't find my shade anywhere anymore
I tried the Good Apple version
 There's no Comparison... bring this back * I need this to come back!!! I haven't found anything that i really like. * I bought this product for many years and I always loved it. However since Kat sold the product off its formula has changed for the worse. I've tried the new version and it's awful I've tried fenti, tarte, double wear, and two others they all suck! * Mine always smelled like paint. Super thick, matte and cakey but superior coverage to anything made ever. * Please bring it back!!!! Nothing compares * My favorite and un replaceable foundation. I haven't found a similar to this one not one!!! This is the best foundation for OILY skin and tge coverage amazing. Loved that it last all day mind you i live in Az and the weather is HOT this foundation would not move at all. Pleas eplease being this back because Good Apple is not close at all in coverage and wear. * This was the only matte foundation i found that made my textred mature skin not look more textured and makes me look older like all other matte foundations I've tried! This one looks so amazing. Stayed all day and i sweat alot on my face. I really dont know why they got rid of this foundation. I literally have not one bad thing to say about this foundation. I really hope they bring this back!!!"
169,lorac,pro soft focus longwear foundation,pimprod2013331,2558415," * I don't like to leave bad reviews, but this foundation was a disappointment for me as I love, LOVE their glass primer. First is that it came out very watery. I understand it is buildable but this was really runny. As others have said, it has a faint maple syrup smell - but for me it was maple syrup mixed with chemical. I am also having some kind of skin reaction and irritation since using this. Nothing major, but enough for me to not use it anymore after 2 uses. Lastly it did not last more than 4 hours. It smeared, creased and caked in areas on my face. Luckily I bought this on sale and just gave it to my niece. This might work for others but for me - no. Sadly their foundation does not live up to the quality of their glass primer - which for me is the best primer in all my years. * I was amazed at how full coverage it is! & how it dosent even look like im wearing foundation! I mean wow !! Definetly will be purchasing more! * I never had a Lorac foundation before, but I know the brand revamped so I thought I would give this a try. It did not dissapoint!!! I have roseacea and dry skin, and this worked amazing for coverage. There is a small scent but it's sweet and lowkey reminds my of syrup. Besides that there are no complaints from me. I would highly recommend using the shade finder tool to compare it to your current foundation. I'm an olive skin tone so it's hard to find foundations that are inclusive of that. I got a summer shade and a winter shade because  I love this foundation so much. Highly recommend! * I don't know if this is supposed to be runny as only a few reviews mentioned it but it's basically colored water & it's so messy. I will never buy this again. * This is my new favorite foundation,
! It has excellent coverage with a natural finish. I have dry skin but find a lot of the hydrating foundations transfer and/or leave my skin looking oily by the end of the day, this foundation looks good all day and doesn't transfer. It does have a incredibly potent smell that lingers long after it dries, but I have been able to get used to it and I only notice when during application. * Although I like this foundation in everyway I have to give a low score because it isn't CRUELTY FREE.   There is no good reason for testing on animals and there are plenty of good products available which ARE CRUELTY FREE too. * I purchased this on a whim as i saw it on sale. I received it at the same time another package with the new Prada foundation came in, and I'm shocked that i like the Lorac foundation more than the Prada!  I applied this with my Hourglass foundation brush as the formula is quite thin amd it went on beautifully. Its so smooth and the finish really is a soft matte. It seems to be very long lasting as well. My first favorite foundation of the year."
170,kiko milano,active foundation,pimprod2036981,2607365," * Ok, there are a lot of decent stick foundations out now (not great, but decent).  I don't think this is one of them.  It's the old school sort--the kind that feels very waxy.  If you have dry skin, you will not be pleased.  It's very hard to get the finish to look good, and even harder to get it to stay looking good.  It's probably not going to save you time or make your life easier on the go. * I am blown away by how amazing this stick foundation is!! It gives a barely there feeling which i love. It does not settle into fine lines and stays on all day. Can't wait to try more stuff from the brand!!! * This stick goes on sooo smoothly! Absolutely love the consistency of this makeup! My skin looked like a barely there makeup look, exactly what i was going for. Definitely need to extend the shade range of this makeup but other than that this stuff is amazing!! * great coverage for my skin tone and felt smooth.  please add more skin tones so all people can have it. * this shade range has every type of tone for lighter skin but for 1 dark complexion do better * I honestly dont unserstand why people who've never tried this give it a low rating due to the shade range. This is an Italian owned brand. Majority of the population is olive, light to medium skintones. Many of them/us have a hard time finding our shades. Go try Fenty Beauty if you dont like it. Anyways, this is fantastic. Super blendable and looks smooth on my texture. * the shade range is disgusting. its not like italy is a sheltered country or anything, many POC reside there. darker women, men, and all in between deserve to have products that fit their skin too. do better."
171,maybelline,instant age rewind perfector 4-in-1 whipped matte makeup,pimprod2028923,2590459," * Its like it never dries and doesnt stick to your skin. So skin ends up looking splotchy. Wipes off easily and blends with nothing. Won't purchase again! * I have combination skin, super oily with dry patches. I hate the feeling of foundation so I just prefer something super light to even out my color and mattify me. This stuff is perfect! It feels completely weightless and looks natural. It wears off gradually by the end of the day without looking crazy. Definitely my favorite face makeup! * It wiped off easily didn't  stay on my face. I would use it in a certain spot and i would try and apply it somewhere else and it would wipe off * As for color match, it's perfect. But it doesn't really cover up my imperfections like age spots * Looks great on my skin. * Very light coverage. Feels so light and soft on skin. Not oily after a full day of wear! Doesn't cover blemishes the best but will give a nice even tone over the skin. Blends nicely! * I loved this! Its very light weight. I used under this my normal skin car rountine. And i wear elf glow sunscreen and halo glow with this bb cream and i loved the result. I do use conceler as well. And i dont feel caked on. Honestly try this method."
172,flower beauty,get real serum foundation,pimprod2022967,2577491," * Ordered Porcelain, second to lightest shade, but its still pretty orange and not as pictured. * Pretty good coverage for a serum foundation, very dewy, very smoothing over texture. Hides my pores, my skin drinks this up. It doesnt settle into fine lines over time like alot of foundations do on me, I have dry skin. I dont know how this would hold up on oily skin, but its great for dry skin! Almost seems soothing for my skin, as it makes my skin very soft when I take it off, has been good for my acne as well. Good on dry spots and excema around my eyes!  Will probably need to set with powder as it is very dewy, but it looks amazing with powder too. Mixes well with other products. Only con is the shade range, not grear for pale girlies * Light coverage, runny. * I had the worst luck with ordering this both  times the  foundation bottle was broken and leaking everywhere also they should've put it in a cardboard box instead of a mailer envelope ,it was an absolute mess that I had to ask for a refund. * I wanted to like this but its sooooo oily right from the start. When I put it on it was very sheer and its not really something I can build up. Also it literally wipes off so there is that. * So good 😊 such good coverage only thing that I didn't like about it was that it was thick. * I am someone who likes a no-makeup look, and this is perfect! The product is very hydrating and goes on in a nice thin coat to make you look flawless and like you don't have makeup on. Unsure if it's buildable since I didn't try. Highly recommend!"
173,pacifica,ultra cc cream radiant foundation with 100% physical broad spectrum spf 17,pimprod2026038,2582152," * this doesn't blend well at all. it's streaky, it doesn't cover, it smells odd. it's just a horrible horrible product. * I have used this foundation for years but the formula has changed, and it is awful. It is so thick it won't pump out. The foundation is clumpy and doesn't spread at all. Why did they change a good product???? * This foundation is worth trying! Creamy, spreads nicely (I use a brush), nice colour matching (I consider myself a medium brown skin colour). Overall great product! * I cannot say enough GOOD THINGS about this CC cream. There comes the point when foundation is out, and CC cream is in, and I am pleased with this product's color choices, smooth texture, and luminescence. I mix two shades and apply the first color as a primer. This CC cream doubles as my concealer; it's that easy to apply. * This product: separates BADLY and doe not blend well at all; Smells weird and chemical-y; offers VERY little coverage, even for a CC cream, and is overpriced because of all these factors. Positives: it makes skin glowy and has SPF. I wouldn't buy this personally - Pacifica's skincare and fragrance are AMAZING, but makeup seems to be a weak point. * This product came out separated. Tried shaking product to get product mixed together and it came out somewhat like foundation. Does not go on skin nicely. Do not recommend. * it comes out as a clear oil with little specs of color that don't blend."

It is so hard for ne to find something that works for my skin and this has been amazing. * A gift card & a sale gave me this dream coverage. I am absolutely in love. This breathable, light satin finish can be set up on itself until youve found your inner teenage beauty queen! It's perfect for my skin type & it smells lovely too. A+ Ulta! * I love this lightweight easy to apply buildable foundation.  And so easy to match my complexion. * it appears that this foundation is being discontinued & I'm so upset. i have 51 y.o. mature, incredibly dry skin. this foundation is so wonderful & I have never found anything comparable. i need this in my makeup arsenal!!! * Please don't discontinue this item! It's the only foundation that works for my mature skin. It goes on so nice and smooth and cover just enough. Please please PLEASE bring back some of the lighter colors. * I bought this over the holidays and LOVED it!! Goes on easily and is weightless. Soooo disappointed to see that my shade is not available. Please do not discontinue this product. * My perfect shade is Light to Medium Cool.  Not available the last 2 times I've tried to buy.  What's up with that.  Not everybody needs a dark shade.  I would venture to say there are more who want lighter shades. Love the silky formula!"

I was not expecting to fall in love with this product, but it's truly flawless. I have NEVER had a shade match me so accurately. This product is buildable and can be worn for 100% full coverage or as a tint. The color is pigmented enough to cover dark undereye without concealer for a very natural ""no makeup"" finish. The price is a steal lol * I have never had a more perfect color match in my entire life. I show this to the older women in my family and you would think I was literally doing a magic trick lol shock awe and wonder. I often and loudly recommend this in True Caramel. Perfect for lace on wigs or just on skin * The foundation is very smooth and moisturizing.  It provides medium coverage, so I build it by applying several applications to get a more full coverage.  It is a great product for the price. * I have purchased this product before and I liked it. This time the product was used. It had a finger smudge print on it when l opened it and the sponge applicator had make all on one side. I ended up purchasing something else at another store. * First, note this has the ingredients that Danessa Myricks uses for her foundation at an affordable cost. This provides a great shade match, makes skin look healthy and even, easy to take with you and stays on even if you sweat. The magnesium carbonate in the formula absolutely is wonderful for sweaty moments. I just find you can't really apply it with anything other than a sponge. Brushes with dense round tops don't pick it up well, as nothing else does. If you don't want to buy a beauty sponge you'll be fine to use the one it comes with. * Great shade for Hispanic women."
176,essence,keep me covered powder,pimprod2043728,2618266," * This is a solid foundation. The key is to prep your skin first. But prep I mean make sure your skin is well-moisturized and use a primer. * This is powder foundation, NOT setting powder. Make sure you moisturize and hydrate!!! well before applying. Test with primer to see which works well with it. 
I found this super easy to use and just faster than liquid foundation. I like it with Wet n Wild Glass Correct in green underneath over redness first. I also used a makeup setting spray after. 
I'm bummed it has poor reviews from people misusing it and that there's no light cool shades left. I just came back to buy another 2:( 
If you see it in store grab it for FOUNDATION,  it's good! * i absolutely love essence, but this is just not it. i wore this to school one time, and my face looked so white and flaky, and very cakey. you can tell the product is cheap, and that's not good. * I love this powder! On top of liquid foundation of course. It gives your foundation that extra boost and smooths out your skin even more. I have Extremely oily skin, I'm talking about im already getting oily an hour after I put my makeup on and this powder does not separate. I even use it to touch up my makeup and makes my skin look smooth and fresh and doesn't cake. best powder I ever used, works just as good as the Mac studio fix plus powder in my opinion. Get it! * The power broke during shipping. And it makes gou look evey ghostly. It ashes out anytning you have on your face * I have used this several times and it's important to remember this is a powder foundation, not a setting powder. it's fantastic when used over moisturizer and primer. also great for touch ups. it definitely looks cakey when not used as described. * This will seperate your makeup, does not look good on almost any skintone, ashy, cakey, and its extremely hard to open."

However, throughout the day it would smear and wipe off so easily :( * The consistency of the foundation is wonderful. It's super light and just melts into the skin. The color range is also phenomenal. I've never found a shade that matched me so perfectly. It literally looks like my skin. All of my friends, family members, and coworkers inquire about the foundation I use, and I have to share the link often. * Great foundation for the price. And it has spf! * Matched me perfectly.

178,l.a. girl,sheer skin tinted foundation,pimprod2025859,2581633," * YALL I SWEAR this is my holy tinted foundation i have ever tried. I have used maybelline bb fresh, covergirl skin milk, covergirl clean matte bb cream, colourpop pretty fresh skin tint, but this is the BEST AFFORDABLE, BEST SHADE RANGE tinted foundation i have ever tried. it feels light and looks so natural. i use shade WARM SAND. (for shade match reference: i also use loreal tinted serum shade 4-5 and the maybelline super stay skin tint in shade 220 & have oily skin) ANYWAYS YALL TRY THIS OUT ITS SO GOOD AND PLEASE NEVER GET RID OF THIS PRODUCT I LITERALLY BEG U GIRL!!! * i wanted something less full coverage, as it would crease in my smile lines, ans this does the trick! its a beautiful finish and lasts my full work shifts! no creasing either!!! * Why would the name be tinted foundation? Isnt all foundation tinted""? Maybe try tinted moisturizer * Light and hydrating product that evens out dull skin without looking heavy! Great for looking put together on minimal makeup days. * The coverage of this bad boy is wat too light to be called a foundation, but it doesnt have any skin care benefits which is I guess why they can't call it BB cream. It's refreshing to have a product with light coverage and a natural finish instead of dewy. Great for no makeup makeup days. * I found the Tawny shade of L.A. Girl Tinted Foundation in my local Ulta's clearance section and figured I'd give it a try. When I got home, I used Ulta's shade matcher and it told me I was really Warm Sand in this product (based off entering Ginger for bareMineral's COMPLEXION RESCUE Tinted Moisturizer Mineral SPF 30). Warm Sand perfectly matches my skin right now during the winter. I'll try Tawny again in the spring/summer, but it was a close match too. I love how lightweight this product feels and how easy it is to apply — I dot it on right from the tube and the dab/blend with a lightly moist makeup sponge. It looks just slightly dewy but doesn't feel overly wet or sticky. It also works well under my bareMinerals BAREPRO 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation if I want to look more made up, but between the price and its natural look when used solo, it fits well with my minimalist approach to makeup. * I am 66 years old. It settled into my wrinkles and emphasized them.  Very sheer coverage. Not a good choice for me."
179,well people,bio powder foundation,pimprod2008579,2553264," * Light, sheer. Shade range is confusing. If unsure, go a bit darker than normal. * I ordered 2W - Warm light - and it was almost white, so light and clearly defective. It did absolutely nothing other than make me have a Casper look. It is so sheer I can't imagine it doing anything even if it was the correct color.  I contacted Well People, I thought they should know how bad the product was, and they didn't care. * W3ll people... we need to talk about the shade range. People with darker skin tones like makeup too yet the shade range completely excludes anyone beyond tan. Thankfully the darkest shade works for me so I enjoy the product but it's hard to get behind a brand that doesn't give darker skintones a thought. * I was really hoping this product would work for me but it didn't. I found the baked foundation to be much more drying than other pressed powders I've previously used. Felt like it didn't go on well and had horrible coverage. Will not be buying again. * Takes forever to build up. Not for anyone who wants medium to full coverage. Light to medium at best. * Honestly if you're looking for a foundation to take a chance on.. this is definitely it. I'm not sure why I even chose to buy this but I love it!! I use it over concealer and it evens out my skin tone perfectly. Also does not make me look too orangey or cakey. * Just meh"

It was so easy to apply, felt nice on my skin, looks natural and I think m10 is my shade - it is spot on (for my beautiful summer complexion ) I'm excited to have found Mented! not a con for me, because i don't choose a makeup to smell good, but definitely seems like fragrance wasn't added.

I have pretty dry sky so I know to add a moisturizer before applying this. I am not saying this drying…but makeup ondry skin can appear patchy * This product feels and looks like you have no product on. * I have searched for the perfect match years! So excited to have finally found a shade so spot on with my skin tone that it's almost scary. The stick foundation is easy to apply, blends well and leaves me a great natural glow. * Looked awful on me. Horrible on oily skin and def dont get if you have light skin. This foundation isnt made for light skin tones which sucks. * Perfect match almost feels like a tinted moisturizer. I'm oily so I still need a powder but for stick makeup it goes on smooth and doesn't run off. I'm sold * Okay so hear me out.. the color match to my skin is amazing!!! it blended beautifully. However, I have combo oily skin and nothing could have prepared me for how shiny and oily this foundation is. This is not a matte foundation so beware!! * Hidden Gem hands down. I have been looking for a good foundation in general for a few years now, I went high end low end drugstore I went tinted moisturizer to full coverage and non did what I actually wanted. I love make up but finding a good foundation for my oily skin that wont force me to re touch (which I'm horrible at by the way, always makes it worse) was close to impossible without making me feel like I have pounds of make up on especially for work. I had tried the Hourglass foundation stick which was highly rated and felt very chalky on my skin. I did a search of stick foundations and came across this one. I am the lightest shade in this line and am on my way to re up for a 3rd time! I have never purchased 1 item more than once since they end up not working out for a while. The coverage is amazing from one layer to a 2 layers if I want a fuller look. It glides on like butter on my skin  and gives me a glow without an oily look if that makes sense. I rarely have to completely set my face because it sets so nice on its own and will literally last me over 9 hours without any cracks or separation and looks like I just applied it minutes ago. It makes my face feel hydrated and not like I'm wearing loads of make up. This is a long review and I never leave a review but I am truly in love with this foundation! I am so thankful for this brand because I am the in between when it comes to make up, I'm a semy fare complexion with neutral undertones. Many lines have a Yellow undertone or an olive undertone which makes me look washed out. This is truly a bang for your buck and will leave your make up looking flawless."

I have very pale, dry skin, this shade range cancels out any issues ive had with light foundations that are too orange, does not stick to or emphasize when i have dryness. I 100% recommend this product. * This doesn't settle in wrinkles like a lot of foundation.  It is a bit hard to use to start with but once you figure it out it's very nice.  Good for older and younger skin.  I'm 64 and it's the best I've ever used. * This foundation is perfect for evening out skin tone without making it look like you painted your make up on. I really love pairing it with cream contour and cream blush, and then just setting it with a setting spray- it gives a gorgeous dewy finish. You can set it with powder to make it a little more long lasting too. I always try to catch it on sale. I think having a gorgeous light coverage foundation like this is perfect for an interview, meeting someone new, or embracing your natural beauty! Its made me feel so much more confident in my own skin. * The origin to my villain story. I listened to an ULTA employee, first foundation for my high school homecoming. Three days later I broke out, having clear skin all my life. Ever since, it never stopped. I had to go on meds to cure my acne. Don't use. * I used to use the old face and body without the radiance and always loved it so im not surprised I love the new version especially because I like more of a sheen/glow to my skin. This is a very sheer coverage foundation but is buildable if you want a little more coverage. Also I can apply this over my skincare without it pilling! * I never tried the original face and body. Honestly, I was never interested in this foundation until I started watching Miss Megan Robinson on tik tok. Seriously you NEED to follow her!! I generally have oily skin. It's been a lot more calm, and a lot less oily after I got rid of all the actives, and JUST started washing, toning, and using AN OIL (I know right, but it's true, oil loves oil, using an oil will keep your skin from producing a lot of oil) I can now wear this foundation confidently, and it is BEAUTIFUL!! It's friction activated so I suggest applying with fingers and rubbing it in so you can start to feel the ""gripping and thickening"" action that happens with this foundation(which is the best most fun part for me). The coverage is obviously light but it looks like perfected skin. Only the best things are peeking through. Everything blends nicely on top, and I mean EVERYTHING, from all different brands. It wears great too and looks even better as the day goes on. Its softly radiant and skin like if you powder (which I still do) and if you don't you'll look like a freshly hot glazed donut (some people like that, some people don't) I get the hype of this foundation and dare I say it's made it into my top 5 line up!!?? Coming from an oily girl that is shocking. If you're wondering, I use the Danessa Myricks yummy skin balm in translucent as a primer, this foundation, all my other creams and liquids, and I set with Mac studio fix powder and one size setting spray.

186,vdl,perfect lasting foundation,pimprod2006000,2560248," * I LOVE this foundation! It's definitely full coverage. It look so beautiful like natural skin! It doesn't dry matte, so definitely set it with powder. I'd say a little goes a long way! It last all day & still look beautiful even after a workout. The only areas that would slightly crease would be around my smile lines & chin but nothing crazy. I wish the foundation would be more available but it's so hard to find & the shade range isn't the best but overall 10/10 I would recommend! My closest shade is A05.5. I also tried mixing V05 & V04 to get my shade if anyone is wondering. I hope this helps.  :) * Coming from an Ulta Employee, after trying every foundation under the sun, this foundation makes my skin look FLAWLESS, airbrushed, smooth. I do have to set with a translucent loose powder because it is still a little tacky in my opinion. Shades are FANTASTIC. A02 matches me the closest; however if there was a slightly paler shade with a yellow undertone that would be my perfect match. I ordered A01 and A02 on YesStyle and to me 1 was almost darker than 2, but it may just be the undertones. ULTA PLEASE BRING THIS BACK. It took me over a week with express shipping on YS btw I paid $19 extra FYI In case anyone was going to order it, I think it ships from China. Idk what is in this foundation but  I want to buy every bottle just incase it ever gets discontinued😅😭😭😭 * My relationship with foundation is a nightmare,I'm a brown skin girl with golden undertones in the summer and pale skin in the winter,without much prep this foundation matched me perfectly and stayed on ALL NIGHT,the a night of dancing 💕LOVE THIS STUFF * Please restock ASAP! This is my favorite foundation!! I literally bought 3 bottles because I have a feeling Ulta might discontinue this foundation...
 FYI- you can still find VDL on Yesstyle BUT it's NOT the same foundation. The one on Yesstyle has SPF & it has more of a dewy finish 😩 * I hope Ulta is not going to stop selling this foundation. It is an amazing satin finish foundation. Looks flawless on the skin and makes blemished skin look smooth. Wears beautifully throughout the day and is full coverage. Highly recommend. FYI if they stop selling it at Ulta you can find it on YesStyle. * I bought this foundation in the color A06. I tend to have a hard time finding foundations because I am in the weird shade range where I'm typically between medium/tan and dark/deep in various brands. I have Neutral slightly golden/olive undertones and find that many brands get close but not perfectly my shade. Most times foundations are too golden (almost orange looking), too cool, exactly neutral when I need just a touch of yellow in the foundation, or they just skip my shade altogether. I was pleasantly surprised when this foundation was an exact match. I love the natural finish to this foundation. I have dehydrated combo skin that if not properly hydrated will get oily in the t-zone (mostly nose area) and will remain normal or slightly dry everywhere else. When I wear this for several hours my foundation goes from very natural to radiant but not oily as my t-zone starts to break into a bit of a shine. I really don't have anything bad to say about this foundation except because of the limited shade range there's a chance you may not find a good match depending on your skin tone and undertone. Hopefully Ulta continues to keep this foundation available. * I would describe this foundation on my skin as full coverage with a satin/slight dewy finish. I have acne prone skin with acne scars and this foundation covers everything without causing any texture. Long wearing and mask proof. Doesn't cause breakouts. Would recommend for various skin types."
187,l'orÃ©al,age perfect creamy powder foundation,pimprod2021675,2569747," * Very light, silky powder texture. The ""creamy"" title is very deceiving though. It's powder. And quite drying immediately on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this for aging skin whatsoever. Great product for on the go touch ups on oily skin. * I don't care for the sponge applicator because it really doesn't go on right, but I found that using a brush to apply is so much better and it goes on more evenly.  You can add more where needed without it looking blotchy.  I love it! Used the color Sienna * Goes smooth and cover some imperfections, but looks natural. Leaves your skin soft and beautiful. * Lightest shade, Ivory.  You MUST prep the skin with moisturizer, sunscreen and either CT Hollywood Flawless Filter or the Maybeline knockoff or a dewy primer or sunscreen.  Buff in with a brush after applying concealer where needed.  Use powder bronzer, blush and highlight and a setting spray.  It looked amazing on my 48 year old dry skin and lasted all day.  Not powdery, didn't settle in lines, let's your skin peek through (is light coverage).   I really love it. * I thought since it's called age perfect it would be a moisturizing creamy powder. Nope. It's super drying and I have combination oily skin not even dry. Feels horrible right on application You can feel the makeup. Didn't blur anything. I had to take it off within 10 mins of application. Don't buy this stuff. * I wanted to try a cream to powder foundation to try to cover some dark spots. 
This covered what I wanted. It does look a little dry after application but I'm oily so it looks more natural after a few hours. * I love the age rewind concealer and seen this after looking for a good powder foundation. it is a really creamy, finely milled powder. I don't think it's really pigmented but you get enough coverage to even everything out and in my opinion it really does blur. I use a flat top Kabuki brush to buff it in, slowly building up layers. I take product and tap it in where I need more coverage with a concealer brush. I find I get the most coverage this way. it's like your skin but better. gives you a nice natural finish and doesn't look cakey if you slowly buff and build. will be trying this as a setting powder for liquid since it blurs. it also doesn't make me breakout!"
188,hynt beauty,encore pressed powder foundation,pimprod2014352,2564466," * I was so excited to try this powder because of all of the positive reviews. Unfortunately, This product didn't work for my dry skin. And for the price I doesn't have great coverage. I don't see this product any different from any other pressed powder. Also, this powder has sparkles in it I guess to conceal how drying and powdery it makes the skin.. * I love this powder, my skin is dry but this powder always feels comfortable on, never adds any texture as other powders have for me in the past, def one of my fav powders * I LOVE this pressed powder! It takes away the look of shine and makes my skin look refined and even toned. I bought Ivory and it is the ideal shade for my skin tone, medium fair with pink undertones. It works well worn over concealer and foundation, or on its own. And, better still, it looks invisible and feels like nothing on skin! The mirrored compact is the perfect size for taking on the go and it even comes with an applicator sponge on a clear, hinged divider inside. Hynt thought of everything with this pressed powder! I will definitely buy again:) * I've always been reluctant to wear powder - most of the time I end up looking cake-y. This finishing powder is a game changer - so easy to apply and bonus, the packaging is so adorable! But more importantly my skin looks so velvety and super plump, definitely will be coming back for more when I'm through with this! * Love using this powder in-between zoom meetings to touch up my skin. Just gives me a more even/finished and natural look * One of my favorite products from Hynt * I used this foundation with the foam puff it came packaged with. Do not use with a brush, the powder is finely milled and will fall off your brush! I wore it over serum and moisturizer. My face got a little shiny throughout the day but that is common for me, as I have combination skin. I like that the coverage is buildable, I was able to apply two layers and achieved the coverage I was looking for. Best of all, the ingredients are natural and truly clean! No SLS, no parabens, no Lauryl Lysine, no Bismuth oxychloride! So happy Ulta is carrying this brand!"
189,hourglass,vanish seamless finish liquid foundation,pimprod2020422,2575785," * For a pro makeup artist, ( yes, you need to be a pro to know how to work with it) this is so far one of the best foundations that I have ever worked with. I recommend performing a gentle face exfolation before bed time and removing any peach fuzz for any makeup aplication, not just this foundation. It makes a huge difference in aplication and appearance of the final look/finish.
It works best with the Vanish smoothing primer. (To smooth down the pores that every human being has) It is runny but extreamly pigmented. Do not use too much or it will look cakey.Best apply with a dense buffer brush (Morphe 444 is my favorite) and then press it in with a beauty blender. I use the professional Kryolan setting spray first, and then set it with a good powder.( Jeffree Star, Fenty or Kryolan powder) It holds for 14h even in humid Florida. Best foundation for events. It's best for normal/ combination skin. I wish they had more shades.
Unfortunately it just has been discontinued, tho the company has gave me insites that they are working on perfecting the formula and making a new foundation for combination/oily skin (they currently carry luminous foundations for normal/dry skin) * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * This product is so thin & runny! Like water consistency. I pumped one pump on my hand & it literally dripped off me. I shook the bottle so many times & it still remained runny. I gave it a try on my face because I wanted to give the foundation a chance but the product just settled right into any crevice it could. I could literally see wrinkles/lines I didn't even know I had. * I got this during a sale and was so excited to try my first Hourglass product. I followed the instructions and reviews and only used a very little amount. It brings out my pores horribly, dries down very weird and makes my skin dry, and even though it feels light on my skin my skin feels a tiny bit sticky, not something I usually experience with prestige brand foundations. This is a miss for me. * This foundation is very reminiscent of Marc Jacob's 'Remarcable' . Full coverage and matte with a pore filling matte primer underneath . The bad reviews are really just people who don't know how to apply makeup . * Words do not explain how buttery this foundation is I have dry to normal skin and it blends it two to three glides. Will never use another foundation"
190,smashbox,studio skin 24 hour full coverage waterproof foundation,pimprod2009758,2552423," * Luckily I night this on a good sale a ways back but it is just not it. I have combo oily skin and so far regardless of the primer or moisturizer this just doesn't look good and will break down. I've been using juvias place which I like ten times better and I don't have to try to make it work. This foundation also oxidizes orange..so not just a shade but it'll turn more orange as well. I'm gonna try to find something to mjx it with but I won't be purchasing again and wouldn't recommend it. * I have oily combo skin, and this foundation did not stand the test of time. It felt very heavy, and transferred with the slightest touch (with setting powder). Only a few hours in, and it was breaking apart on my face, highlighting even the slightest texture. My pores were literally drinking this product up. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a foundation, and could not wait to take it off. * I have combo skin, I use the Bobby brown moisturizer primer underneath and only use a tiny bit with a brush. Looks flawless!! Do not use to much product otherwise it will look cakey, if you need extra coverage apply only to specific area with smaller brush. * 32f (no active breakout/indented scars only on cheeks/combination skin)This foundation has the worst formula I have ever used on my skin. I tried two different primers underneath and tried it on it's own and it just refused to settle or smooth out. It creases badly and makes skin look dry and caked with very minimal use of the product that looked worse and worse if you tried to use even a tiny bit more. Powders and setting spray do nothing to help. I tried beauty blenders and brushes and neither made it better. I ended up going back to a trusty Revlon foundation that was way cheaper and a much better formula. Do not waste your money if you do not have perfect smooth skin. * I have sensitive skin with large amounts of rosacea and occasional eczema. This product covers my redness very well, and can many my dry areas seemingly disappear. Smashbox was also a line that came up multiple times during my search for products best for sensitive skin. * Maybe this just doesn't work with some skin types. I've given this several goes with different amounts of product and application techniques and it always manages to cake up and accentuate every pore after it's settled. I decided to give this one more go, applying after a glowy moisturizer that managed to save some of my other cakey products and it still had the same issues after setting for about 20 minutes. * It has perfect coverage,  a very little goes a long way.  Love the Matt finish I got.  Like  all foundations,  you have to prepare your skin before you applying anything to it.  Use a brush to apply.  I patted it on."
