1,urban decay,face bond self-setting waterproof foundation,pimprod2044818,2623593," * I tried this as a sample the very first time put it on at 7am and by bed time everything was still in place!!! (I recommend using the urban decay all nighter with it) if you hace super dry skin or don't like matte finish this is not for you (: * The very best no feeling foundation! I can wear it for hoursss and still feel fresh . It does dry quickly so be weary and move fast.( I have little to no texture on my face , and my skin is oily. ) * Finally something easy to put on and go without mutliple other products! and it looks  great the whole time!!! Now it takes very little ive seen people cake it on and wonder why they look cakey lol and im combo skin so on my dry days just a little milky toner before * I tried Face Bond because Urban Decay discontinued their Stay Naked foundation. I was hopeful this new product would slide right in as it's replacement, however I am definitely disappointed and missing the Stay Naked. It is thicker, sticky, and difficult to regulate precisely how much to dispense. I wont return it, but I'm def now on the hunt for a new foundation. * Extremely dry and cakey. Absolutely not worth the money. Dont believe the fake social media hype. Its a trash product * I bought this for something long wearing and to have a semi natural finish. great product * I gave two stars because the shade match actually worked for me. Nothing else did.  This foundation did NOT bond to my face, was hard to blend, appeared patchy, and was not at ALL waterproof.  One tear down my cheek completely ruined my makeup.  Cannot wear with glasses, either.  Completely disappears. I will NOT buy again."

I absolutely loved it! Only downside is that I think I got the wrong shade because I look orange lol but i still love it! btw this foundation has a slight floral scent! * Makes it seem like I have good skin. it's not super glowy which I like. I lightly powder. Looks really nice. I'm wearing this in winter and it's going well. Im hoping it holds up in summer because its beautiful.My skin is combination. * I have been wearing estee lauder foundation for years after switching from urban decay after urban decay changed their foundation line. Estee lauder gives the perfect coverage, but is very thick. I also had a hard time matching the perfect color. Dior is my new favorite! Smooth, better matching of colors, and the perfect coverage. Also a plus that it smells amazing! Super fast shipping! * I have been wearing estee lauder foundation for years after switching from urban decay after urban decay changed their foundation line. Estee lauder gives the perfect coverage, but is very thick. I also had a hard time matching the perfect color. Dior is my new favorite! Smooth, better matching of colors, and the perfect coverage. Also a plus that it smells amazing! Super fast shipping! * I am 38 with dry skin. I told the consultant that Im a having trouble finding makeup that didn't settle into lines and didnt come out cakey and flakey. She recommended hygen primer and Dior make up. She color matched me with the very first bottle she picked up! It matches perfectly! And I'm happy with the results. I can wear make up agian! * This is so cakey and made me break out worse than I've ever broken out before and I dont have acne. * I love this foundation so much! I have very dry skin, and this does not cling to any dry patches. It makes my skin look hydrated and it is super lightweight. However, there is a slight floral fragrance to it, that I was not used to at first."

5,lancÃ´me,teint idole ultra wear 24h full coverage foundation,pimprod2039028,2608119," * This foundation is the best foundation i have ever use its so light and full coverage at the same time it feels like ur not even wearing makeup and the online shade match id on point it seriously looks like im not even wearing foundation * I have been using this same foundation for 20 years. 220 buff cool. I decided to order another bottle before i ran out of the old one and chose the shade that matched the old formula. I could not understand what i was doing wrong when i started using this. It settled into every pore i didnt even know i had, it looks like i rubbed chalk on my face because its so dry and clings to dry patches. After trying to work with it for several days exfoliating, and different primers it finally occured to me that they didnt just change the shades they changed the formula as well. I reached for what was left in my old bottle from the original formula and it went on like a dream! It was then i realized that now i sadly have to search for a new foundation after all these years. I do not know what made them decide to change something that had such good reviews for so long. I also purchase their skin care as well. Foundation searching is tricky and expensive . I have already theow out the box so i cant return it. I figured why would i need to save the box i have been using it for so long. Good bye forever lancome * I love the long wearability of it * If you don't have time to fuss with your make-up, this make-up base is ideal, and the wide range of colors is bound to provide something healthy and natural looking, particularly if you're in the store where you can ask for help. * Will never ever buy snother foundation. This is 1000000% worth every single penny a thousand times over and i am extremely picky about foundation because i have combination skin. But this stuff is amazing. Feels like a second skin. Is buildable. Not thick. Glides on, easy to blend. Love it 10/10 * This is the only foundation that I will ever use!! So nice and easy to apply! Literally looks like skin! * I asked for a makeup that was not matte,  was full coverage, some ""glow"" to it.  This has nothing i asked for.   I'm having to add extra products to get the look I was wanting....another waste of $$"

8,nars,light reflecting advanced skincare foundation,pimprod2030141,2591117," * It just didn't work for my skin. It cracked around my nose and just didnt blend well. Im not sure if it was my skincare routine that did not react well with the makeup or what. Have to return * I purchased this after the Ulta employee assured me this perfomed the same as Nars Radiant foundation. Could not be more opposite! This adds texture to my skin and is super patchy. And it separates after an hour. I tried all the different application methods and none worked. I used the primers suggested, the using my fingers instead of a brush or sponge, i tried it all. Nothing worked. Its the foundation. Will be going back to my ABH luminous foundation. * I am in my  60's and I was using Lorac Porefection, but it's no longer available. I've tried to find something that didn't look drying or sink into my fine lines. I like a glowy look. I tried Laura Geller for amture skin and hated it, way too dry looking for me. I love this Nars light reflecting is the perfect coverage, not heavy or cakey and does give your skin a glowy look all day. * This is my new favorite foundation. It is buildable, blend-able and lightweight. The result looks fresh and bright. * Recently got this. I had mac studio fix previously but needed a new shade for winter and wasn't in love with the way it looked on my skin. So the gal at Ulta recommended this one for my combination, 32 year old skin. Love that i can build it up to full coverage or wear it really sheer for a natural finish depending on my preference, also i do not need concealer to cover scarring this covers so well when i buff a lil more foundation onto those particular areas. Even if i buff some more under my eyes it looks nice for an everyday natural look rather than a thick concealer. I DO have large pores and acne scarring snd it looks beautiful on my skin. Ive heard some women say it enhances their pores and textured skin but imo a specified primer would help some with that but you could only do so much regardless ya know.. So ive just accepted my skin the way it is and it looks beautiful on my skin not cakey. I do not set my skin, and after the end of a long day like mad woman, with 4 kiddos, it still looks so beautiful and covers my flaws so freakin well. Hope this review helps. :) also ps she color matched me perfectly and on my skin it does not oxidize. Only did a bit once when i put too much mac primer under. Try it you just may like it. And if not you can always return. * Recently got this. I had mac studio fix previously but needed a new shade for winter and wasn't in love with the way it looked on my skin.

At 71 I do not have wrinkles but due to my age, most foundations that i could wear years ago i can no longer wear and have it look good and natural looking on my skin. This foundation is virtually flawless on my skin and acts like a second skin without that heavy foundation look. Covers dark spots and gives my skin a nice soft texture & natural look ive never been able to achieve with other brands in this class of makeup. I live in a hit summer climate & this really makes it feel like no makeup on but looking fabulous too.Only thing i do not like is the price."
9,mac,studio fix fluid spf15 24hr matte foundation + oil control,pimprod2044825,2622206," * After reading all the reviews ,I know I wasn't exaggerating about how terrible this new formula is! Nobody likes it! Bring back the original please! The new one is cakey, oily but dry at the same time, like how!? Moves all over and doesn't stay or last. Makes my skin look older, just awful! It was embarrassing to go out wearing it seeing how bad it looked after just applying it! As if that wasn't enough, it broke me out so much! * So disappointed when I tried the new formula.I gave it so many chances with different skin preps. Disappointment every time.It was actually embarrassing to have to wear it the entire day cuz it looked so bad! The ""great reviews"" must be bots or compensation. * Who actually thinks this is a great foundation?! It's awful, I thought it was a knock off! At this point, with this price tag, a drugstore foundation would be better. New formula doesn't stay on, creases, cakes, gets oily and settles on every line * Terrible! This new formula makes you look both dry AND oily! How can it actually be this bad!? Lol!
Accentuates every fine line and pore on your face. Transfers at the slightest touch, it does not stay on. MAC dropped the ball on this one big time! * I LOVE, LOVE  this foundation! I've been using this product for at least 11 years, and I even if I try to change to another product I always come back. I'm now 37 years old and this is the only foundation that works with my normal/combination skin. * I would start by calling this a good foundation for a special occasion. I don't know that I would wear it on the daily because while it has a comfortable wear, it definitely feels like my skin has less breathing room than it would with a lighter foundation. That said, this foundation definitely holds up to MAC's standards of high coverage and high longevity, and I was shocked to actually find a shade that matched my skin perfectly. I bought this to use as bridesmaid makeup and my face lasted from 10am Saturday to 1am Sunday on a 75-degree day in Mexico. For reference, my skin tends to be neutral but leans very slightly oily. I can't speak for how this foundation will hold up if you have oily skin or dry patches, but it definitely held up well to some mild oil buildup throughout the day * Silky smooth and light."

But I am not sure if they have changed the formula. It is not the same as it used to be. * Great foundation with decent coverage but yet still a light foundation that doesn't feel cakey. Definitely recommend trying if you are looking for a new foundation! * Love it * The finish on this foundation is matte and last on my skin throughout the day depending on what powder I use after and with proper skin preparation. It does dry down fast so blending quickly is crucial. The packaging is sleek, clean, and nice compared to drugstore foundations. I would buy this foundation again and recommend it to those with oily skin types looking for a matte foundation. * MUA here to tell you to please swatch this formula and let it dry for 10 minutes before purchasing and watch how the color changes before purchasing to make sure it still works for you.  It will continue to get darker as well as warm up.   This product works best for people with strong warm / golden undertones who want full coverage. If you have neutral or cool / pink / red undertones, dry skin, sensitive skin, or foundation easily turns you orange, this may not be for you. Please see a beauty advisor in store for this one, folks. * Love this foundation, it stays on all day and doesn't come off on my clothes."

14,it cosmetics,cc+ nude glow lightweight foundation + glow serum with spf 40,pimprod2031824,2594106," * I use the original cc cream and have for years. Unfortunately, the color doesn't quite match my face. (I am between fair and light—fair light does not work because it is pink). The same is true with this version. But This is sheerer and covers less * I read some review about this foundation that made me wary to purchase. I went in store and test under one eye and cheek area and didn't see a different at all. Looked like I just put some lotion on. I walked around for about ten minutes then looked in the mirror again, and oh my! I didn't look like I had any makeup on, but the side I put the foundation on looked healthier and brighter, and my dark circles were almost invisible. The color correction is on point! I am very fair skinned and used Fair Beige. Purchased after I saw the difference! * Looks beautiful on, got a great shade match, and also fungal acne safe. However, it transfers insanely, cant be set with powder, and burned putting it on and taking it off * Product works great, but I need a lighter shade. Associate recommended a shade that's a little to dark * I was hoping to like this, but I felt it never really dried on m face, very sticky * I keep trying to like this foundation but after a day of use I throw it in my drawer disappointed again.  I'm 66 years old with combo skin and this foundation makes me oilier instead of a glow. * I always feel like this just sits on my face, and it rubs off easy."
15,estee lauder,futurist hydra rescue moisturizing foundation spf 45,pimprod2013152,2577966," * If you are on the fence - READ THIS: I am a hardcore makeup enthusiast and ive tried all kinds of foundations across the spectrum. I was hooked on the Loreal Infalliable foundation for years because its long lasting and I need medium to full coverage that lasts 12+ hours. However, my aging skin needed a better foundation that incorporates skin care and more sunscreen. For reference, I am in my late 30s, I have extremely dry skin, but I get oily in my T zone. I have to layer on products under my makeup to keep me hydrated and so I don't look like a flaky mess - and I am starting to get crows feet and other fine lines. I went to the Ulta store and this caught my eye, and I'm so glad it did. This product has absolutely changed my life and my confidence levels. I would definitely recommend going to the store to find your shade match because there are tons of shades, and they all have very different undertones, but I was able to find my perfect match for the first time in my life. It feels like skin care with medium buildable coverage and gives you the most flawless, beautiful skin like finish. I literally gasped when I put it on. It also works well with other cosmetic brands for concealer, powder, etc. I use Tarte's Creaseless concealer, Maybelline poreless powder, and MMMade by Mitchell bronzer and my skin looks absolutely FLAWLESS even with NO primer. Please never discontinue this item!!!! Estee Lauder absolutely crushed it with this product!! Any negative reviews on here I would chalk up to poor skin care prior to application because this stuff really feels like second skin. DON'T HESITATE BUY IT!!!!!!! :) * My favorite foundation . Love the formula for my skin . Doesnt leave my skin oily like NARS or other liquid foundations do . Has good hydration and lasts all day * This product has a strong fragrance. It did not blend well, and had a very dry pasty effect. I'm a less is more type girl, so maybe it would work for someone who does a bit more layering of products? I would say primer is a must under this product. It literally reminds me of liquid face paint. * I typically wear Lancome Skin Feels Good but wanted something with more coverage and more dewy finish, which this has on both counts. It feels nice on dry winter skin, looks decent for most of my work day. The colors are a litle darker than they appear in the example photos. I purchased Ecru 1n2, and it would really be more appropriate for a summer shade for me. The photos just made the lighter colors look basically white. However, I found the corresponding concealer in this line to be too light!!! I would have gotten a better match in person, but most of my local Ultas dont carry EL in store. * First off, I'm 42, a skincare enthusiast, and my dry/combo skin requires a moisturizing foundation. I've tried most high end foundations, and the EL Futurist Hydra foundation is it, folks. I'm on my fourth tube, and I'll keep buying it along with the Futurist primer. Not only is this foundation non drying, long lasting & great at covering redness -- the added SPF 45 is a total bonus. The high SPF is what made me purchase initially. Granted, I apply an SPF before my makeup routine, but hey, the more the merrier. Highly recommend. * I purchased this foundation about five years ago, back when there was only a few shades. I guess they were testing the market at the time. I ended up with the lightest shade (Porcelain C0). I used it until the tube expired, and now I bought my normal shade from EL which is 1C1 Cool Bone. I'm so happy they offer this shade now! Truthfully, both shades suit me fine. I have pale skin with a pink undertone. I am 40 years old and have combo skin that leans dry in the winter and more oily in the summer. I love this foundation in the winter months to keep my skin plump and hydrated! It goes on like butter with a high medium coverage. I tried this in the summer, and it didn't last very long. It's totally fine since I switch up foundations between colder and warmer months.  This is an awesome foundation if you have dry skin! * Moisturizing, silky smooth to apply, and the color is just right."

17,pur,4-in-1 love your selfie longwear foundation & concealer,pimprod2005671,2544533," * I looooove this foundation. I've seen other reviews talking about it being cakey and other negative things but if you know how to properly prep your face before applying foundation (this applies to ANY foundation) then you will LOVE this brand. I have Very sensitive skin and hate the feel of foundation on my face but I don't mind this one at all! You get a full coverage and it's lightweight. I've been using this brand for a year and I'm truly impressed. * I love this foundation i just which the shades would expand in store. The coverage and longevity is insane. I have replaced my double wear with this foundation. It's cheaper and better. I love how the wand is on the inside so that i can use it also as a concealer…Also there is primer and skincare in this foundation!!! * I really need a gluten free foundation, and this isn't worth the money. Like others have said, it looks cakey. Somehow it LOOKS dry, but it slides right off like it's an oil. Settled into every freaking line and ended up looking like bad Halloween makeup. I will give it one more chance - going to try it without moisturizer underneath, because it was hard to wash off the back of my hand. If it still sucks, it's getting returned. * Should have researched before I bought it. Similar to other reviews, sales associate recommended this brand. I tried to convince myself it was ok, but it just wasnt. My coworkers kept asking me if i felt ok bevause I was so pale. It doesnt last, very cakey (I look like a girl from the movie White Chicks) and shows EVERY SINGLE pore and crease you may have. Such a bummer. Returned. Sales associates must get a kick-back because this product just isnt good and shouldn't be promoted. * Should have researched before I bought it.

I have olive undertones and its one of the only prodacts that i can find with neutral undertone color that sits well with it. I never look too warm or blue or grey. Specially with my winter skin tone color. In the summer, i know i can find my exact match with my olive undertone too and it looks amazing. I wish it was cheaper but the finish is so natural and pretty and photopgraghs so well. I always get told how great my skin looks when wear it out and no one suspects im wearing a full face because its so light weight and so ""your skin but better"" looking. I LOVE IT * Good coverage, very strong scent, very runny"
18,it cosmetics,cc+ cream natural matte foundation with spf 40,pimprod2044261,2621797," * Been using this for years, recommended to a lot of ppl. Recently purchased new tube & found that the formula changed. I have oily skin & the product applies well but after oil surfaces its terrible. If you touch it comes off, and it looks hideous. * I purchased this in the same color that I normally do (fair light). After I used all of my old tube, I opened the new tube and the color is much darker. It is brown on my face and I am fair skinned. I went to Ulta as well as chatted with customer service about the possibility of it being mislabeled and they would not offer and exchange or refund. I sent pictures of the color difference also. I will not be purchasing again and have wasted my money on a product I cannot use. * If you have even skin and only require coverage it's probably a good product. It is not a good product for aging skin. I tried this several ways - with the Confidence in a cream under it, just bare skin, sunscreen, and primer. I also tried different applications. No matter how I prepped my skin it just magnified everything. Color match was ok. * Overall great product but for some reason it seperates around ny mouth tzone and chin. I have tried different primers but none seem to work. * Fair Light is supposed to be cool undertones, but it was so orange on me. It was thick and cakey and just looked awful, like old make up. * I'm torn on It Cosmetics CC creams. I've tried them all and like how I look in pictures while wearing it, but I don't like other things about it. I purchased this version, Matte light, on Black Friday so I got a good deal. I am not pale, nor dark - just somewhere in the middle. (I wear 1N2 in Estée Lauder) The light shade goes on way too dark; it does adjust, but you look hideous in the 10-20 minutes in the meantime. No matter what method I tried (It CC brush, beauty blender, or fingers), I could not get it to blend flawlessly into my hairline or around my eyebrows. My two main complaints though are 1) I can feel it sitting on top of my skin and 2) I looked like I was wearing makeup. I am a teacher and by the end of the day, I just wanted to go home and wash my face because it felt heavy. I also want the ""no makeup makeup look"" and this ain't that. I would recommend this product for a wedding or a fancy affair, but not for every day life if you're just a regular mom trying to survive. * Only gave four stars since it's somewhat hard to blend. I've found it blends best with a damp sponge, not with just my fingers. Great, buildable coverage that could be medium to full. The color range has gotten better since the last time I purchased and I appreciate that there are more cool tones available now."

20,fenty beauty by rihanna,eaze drop blurring skin tint,pimprod2031372,2592608," * I have oily skin and adore this skin tint! I have repurchased twice now and will continue to. The shade range is gorgeous (not anything new thanks riri) and I'm able to match perfectly to my summer and winter shade. It has a natural finish and buildable coverage. Blends best with hands or beauty blender, I don't like how it blends as much with a brush. * This was great! The color matched great. This is my first time using a blurring tint and really liked it. It wasn't too heavy which is my preference. I like a lighter coverage. It didn't break my skin out and covered any imperfections in my skin. Will use again. * The blurring skin tint is beautiful and light weight with a formula that falls somewhere between a tinted moisturizer and a liquid foundation. I received this product in exchange for my honest review in shade 2, which is a good shade for me in the winter. I purchased shade 6 myself for summertime. I seriously love this foundation and finding a thin formula that doesn't feel suffocating on my combination pail cool neutral  olive skin is tough. Both of these shades work for me depending on how much sun I've had. Best applied with a sponge, but can be applied with fingers in a pinch.  No fragrance and easy to travel with. I will be purchasing again in near future when I run low. Highly recommend! * This is my first time using a Fenty beauty product and I finally understand the hype! This blended into my skin flawlessly and held up the entire day. It was easy to dispense the product right onto my face then use a makeup sponge to blend in. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest feedback. * This is one of those that I'll defer to my lovely lady's opinion, since she's the one wearing it! I've transcribed her detailed notes below:

Likes:

1. Great color matching, probably the best I've seen in a very long time. 
2. Stayed put and felt light on my face all day without transferring. 
3. Scent was pleasant and not overpowering.
4. Coverage was light, with the option for heavier applications. 
5. My skin felt soft and dewy.

Dislikes:

1. It was not forgiving at all for my dry skin. No matter how many times I exfoliated my face, the skin tint serum settled into my fine lines and wrinkles.
2. It also did not look well on rough patches. Because of this, I will probably only wear it during the summer, when my skin isn't as dry. * This product works really well and has great coverage. The texture isn't too tick and it's not like water either. The finish is a good looking product, and it lacks a scent which is always nice. * This is the worst product. Difficult to apply, doesn't blend, such bad coverage, and does not feel good on the skin. Bad bad product."

It's buildable coverage which is convenient. * I love it! * I really wanted to like this, but it just doesn't work for me. I like that it's affordable, has a wide range of shades, and is hydrating. But that's it. The cons for me outweigh the pros. 

No matter how I apply it or how I set it, it always pills in about 4 hours. It's very sheer coverage. It gets greasy as the day goes on. Lastly, it shows texture. I do think this is meany for someone looking for a tinted moisturizer. But, it's not for me no matter how I tried to work with it. * The best foundation I have used in 20 years * I purchased shade Light 03C which is labeled as having pink undertones, but when I applied the foundation it was completely yellow. Very disappointing considering I adore their concealer. * Amazing foundation! A good medium coverage that sinks into the skin, looks flawless, and last all day. Looks better and last longer than most high end foundations I have purchased. Will definitely be repurchasing. * This is a very good foundation. it is not heavy has nice coverage and is hydrating. It does not cake on me blends very easily and looks fantastic. it is  one of my favorites and i have some really expensive foundations in my collection."
24,tarte,face tape full coverage foundation,pimprod2003933,2540290," * I was scared to try it at first but I have the shape tape concealer, and the foundation works very well for me as someone who has combination skin. its lightweight sometimes I forget I have it on * Great coverage but it dries down immediately and it's impossible to blend. I had to rewet my beauty blender multiple times and apply multiple layers of moisturizer and serum before applying to get it to blend at all. Felt like stage makeup. Wouldn't rebuy. * As a mature almost 50 year old woman, i see all these tutorials about concealers and which ones work the best, best coverage, wont get in fine lines, etc, etc. Ive tried so many. With this product I only need this product, not any extra under eye concealers, just this one! 
My sister and i were on vacation and she said your skin always looks so good, let me try that stuff, she is even older than me and fell in love with it, couldnt believe the coverage!

It provides excellent coverage, it's wet enough to cover all areas needed and dries down perfectly. I would buy this again! I did not notice any issues with rubbing off on clothes or getting thinner after wearing it for extended periods of time. * This is, by far, the fullest coverage I've EVER seen. I can't use it as a foundation. I actually had to use it as concealer to not throw it in the garbage. * I love the makeup"

This foundation so far keeps my face from getting too oily and greasy at least for 6 hours.  Just wonderful! * This is my favorite, it blurs my pores & gives my skin a healthy look. I get compliments all the time w/ this. I was raving till 7 am, this stayed put!! * I have been struggling to find a moisturizing foundation for my dry skin in the winter months. I have tried several different drug store and high-end brands and nothing compares to Maybelline's Super Stay 24hr Skin Tint. It is light weight and gives me the coverage I need for my uneven skin tone. It does not cake or crease in my fine lines. I will never go back to another foundation after using this!!! * It's not as light of a tint as I would've hoped, but it is very light on the skin, I actually really like it for everyday wear. * I love using this for everyday wear. It holds up nicely and does well with oily/combo skin. * I absolutely love this skin tint. Its so bulidable if i want to go lighter or heavier i can. Its like my skin but better. It does help fight the sweat on the humid days when paired with a good primer. Highly recommend. * This Maybelline Skin Tint is beautiful on the skin and it does last.  I really like it!  It is difficult to find my exact shade.  At this point, I have purchased three shades before I found one that really matches.  I wish there was a way to have small samples we could try prior to purchase.  However, the effort was worth it!!"

The smell was absolutely terrible, I found the coverage to be uneven, and after an hour or so of wear, I looked in the mirror and it really exaggerated my fine lines and pores. I for sure would not recommend this foundation to anybody over the age of 35. * This is a no for me. It smells terrible and does not work on my skin. Exaggerates dry spots, separates in oily areas, and looks cakey with any amount of product. I've tried applying with fingers, brushes, and sponges. I'm really disappointed I spent so much on it. Drugstore foundations are much better quality than this one! * This is a difficult foundation to work with, the coverage never looks even to me and it's not buildable. up close, I can see it pills on my skin if I pass the sponge over it more than a couple of times. cream products don't layer over it well - it's hard to blend cream blush, bronzer and highlighter on top and it transfers and moves all over the face. It doesn't really set down, even with powder. I have dry skin and never have issues with uneven coverage or getting a foundation to set down, with or without setting powder. I'm just not a fan, I have wet n wild, Catrice, urban decay and Pat McGrath foundations that all perform better across the cost spectrum. * This a wonderful foundation. It gives perfect coverage, making my skin look dewy and fresh.   The best part is that it is a clean product, without the bad stuff.I love this brand. * Not enough coverage for my aging skin! * Unsure. It's not like it's a bad product. I feel it's good quality. I think maybe for a lighter foundation could be a good find. I feel for the price, what my expectations were; not a good buy necessarily. Fell a bit flat for me. I've also only used a couple (2-3) times. Maybe it grows. My skin feels nice.
I don't feel excited afterwords-if that makes sense? Sometimes I put on foundation and I'm like ""OO-Hello there!"" I put this on and feel like…ehh. Best way I can put it. I did have a more positive prospective when adding a glow enhancer. It's ok."

I've gotten this twice & both tines the shade way too light. Second it's way too thick & very difficult to blend. Third it's very drying in some spots & it would make ne look oily in others. Fourth it was so hard to work with & i tried different powders & primers & I always looked so patchy. Some areas wouldn't even take foundation. I knkw this works for some people, but if you're combination with more dry leaning skin then i highly suggest buying something elae because this is not for you. * It dries down and gets patchy. I wanted to like it but no. * If your looking for a medium to light weight wear foundation with full coverage this is for you. I say medium to light weight wear because on certain areas of the skin you can feel it. It is like cement once you lay it down, you gotta jack hammer it to get it up. Completely waterproof and transfer proof. It is 100% worth the price * I love how light weight it is. Medium to full coverage. However, I had a hard time finding my shade. It was either too light, too dark, or too red. But I finally found a match. I realized it oxidizes a tad bit darker. Overall, I'm loving it. * First time i tried it was okay second time it was just a no leave the skin very patchy and cakey throughout the day it separates so much i don't recommend buying this * I love this product! It has been the best I've tried! Makes my face feel put together, stays on, doesn't cake and feels hydrated! I've recommended to others and they have purchased it. It's a keeper. * Covers incredibly well. Lasts all day without retouching. Makes my textured skin look flawless."

I love the Loreal tinted serum, so i said lets try this. After some trial and error application between gripping primer or pore filling I have figured it out. This definitely sits best for me with a silicone pore filling primer. Tik tok told me to try power grip. That was not a match on my skin. I used a damp blender to apply. I love the natural ""clear"" finish it gives me. 
  ** Make sure before you apply you have a good skin care moisturizer locked in. * I personally love this product that I have not changed my foundation because it just makes my makeup feel nice and I believe it good for those who like doing full face and want that feeling that you can breathe and doesnt feel heavy!! * This is the best foundation I have ever used. I have tried Dior, Chanel, and many others and they do not compare. This foundation is light yet concealing. It is not ""cakey"" or heavy. It is great for all day wear. * So when you first put this on it looks stunning! So natural and the color was great for me. However after about two hours it really started looking horrible on dry spots and coming off. It also has a scent like theres perfume in it which is odd for a foundation. It could be breaking me out bc my skin has been bad and almost stinging when applying products. This could be holy grail but something is off!! * I love this product * Light weight but full coverage and non greesey. * This has a nice coverage, I wouldn't say 32 hours by any means but decent product. I do use the primer which I think helps too."

I decided to go for a clean foundation and sooooo happy I made this move. My skin looks healthy and bright ! In the winter I just add a drop of moisturizer when applying and no signs of patchy skin and no wrinkles. If you want full coverage apply two pumps. In my opinion one pump it's plenty. I higly recommend Barepro 24 hrs wear skin perfecting matte foundation * omg- i swear this foundation is a 0/10 for me. I didnt even know the old formula was swithced until I went in store looking. IM SOO disappointed genuinely. Also can we talk about why it has a super strong spell of olive oil…? immediately a no for me. Especially as someone with oily skin I would never ever recommend. * I can say i havent bought the new formula but tried it after I ran out. I can say the old formula truly stayed on like a stain, in a good way. Didnt need primer or setting powder and looked like skin. New formula moves around and after letting it sit on my skin it transfered. Also doesnt look as natural anymore. Very dissapointed. Why do companies change a formula that had no issues. Bareminerals, please be smart and bring back the old formula. Honestly you will probably make more money keeping the old formula. You could have just made this one and kept the old one. So yeah I was and am still dissapointed because I will have to move on to another brand for the same if not similar attributes of the old formula. * Sat on my skin terribly"

It leaves my skin feeling moisturized without clumping, giving me a youthful glow. The formula is incredibly easy to blend, making it super easy to apply. In a world where everything feels complicated, having a foundation that simplifies my routine is a game changer! * Just hit my 40s and ive used NARS for years. It suddenly started sinking into my forehead lines making them look terrible. Found the recommendation for Polite Society on Tiktok and decided to try it. Its amazing. Its light and doesnt feel cakey at all. Long-lasting as well. Love the fact that its skincare too! Perfect foundation! * This foundation became my new favorite the first time I tried it. I was a loyal Armani Silk foundation girl, but that foundation was just starting to not wear well on me, making me look older and patchier. After a many trails with different foundations, I have 100 percent found my new staple! It wears just as if not MORE beautifully than the Armani silk, and with a lower price point. This foundation HYDRATES my skin, I look dewy in the most BEAUTIFUL way. My skin looks flawless. This is magic in a bottle!! * Love this foundation! It is now a part of my daily makeup routine. Will be buying again! * I wish I would have taken the reviews about the pump breaking to heart. The foundation is nice, but the pump is worth leaving it behind. My pump broken after a few uses, and it just became an unbearable mess to deal with. Due to the nature and shape of the packaging, depoting it into something else is nearly impossible…just a waste of time and money. * I purchased the foundation because the lipstick lesbians gave a great review. The color match for my skin was perfect. I ended up having bumps after using it on my bare skin. My face is still bumpy after a couple days.
I do have sensitive skin * My skin has never been better.
Love the way it feels and its got all day wear. My skin tends eat makeup and separate, not with this one.

38,clinique,even better clinical serum foundation broad spectrum spf 25,pimprod2021174,2574625," * First of all, my skin isn't super acne prone. My skin is very pale/light, and neutral in tone. I used the LIGHTEST possible shade, and still looked like an Oompa Loompa. The shade range is awful, and this left my skin orange, cakey, high and DRY! NO! * I was so excited to try this for the benefit of the serum , but it was awful! I live in a dry clinate and this accentuated dryness on my face that no amount of moisturizer couid fix.  It went on incredibly thick and gave me a pasty & cakey look.  I switched back to the Even Better Broad Spectrum and that looks great. * I love clinique makeup and most of their foundations. This one one is just awful. I got it as free gift for reaching diamond level. I went to see if i could exchange and they would not let me since it was a free gift. I threw it in the trash. The foundation is so drying. I didn't like the way it sat on my skin. Would not recommend * This is such a heavy foundation. It managed to make every line and wrinkle more pronounced. The shade names are really off. The neutral color gave me an orange tint. Oat had a lot of brown undertones. Not your typical shades. * Definitely one of the worst foundations I've tried. Looks cakey and heavy. By the end of the day, it was splotchy and my face was an oil slick even though I dont have oily skin. Not to mention it oxidizes like crazy!!! * They talked me in to one that is to dark and to dry for my skin but it's really good makeup * This is one of the worst foundations I think I've ever used, I now know why ulta was offering this as a free gift for diamond members. It aged me 20+ years and sunk into wrinkles and lines I had no idea I even had. Also it's very heavy (I normally like medium to heavy coverage) but this felt like I was applying paint on my face. Lastly, the shade matches all sort of were not accurate? This product is just a complete pass for me"
39,natasha denona,hy-glam powder foundation,pimprod2044289,2624364," * I have enjoyed using powder foundations off and on since high school especially when traveling and needing to get out of the house quickly. However, they are not the best for aging skin that is becoming more dry. This is the first and only powder foundation I have ever used that actually looks like a liquid in that it looks Fresh and skin like with a healthy natural finish. I can get solid medium coverage with this with the use of a fluffy brush, a flat top brush and a pencil brush for any freckles or blemishes. Every time I use this, someone tells me my skin looks amazing. I've already bought two backups. I have a fair slightly pink neutral complexion and I wear N1. I highly recommend! * I've been using Physitians Fomula powder foundation with SPF 30 for many years,  which was cheap and had a very good coverage but I hated how it accentuate my pores and had so much fall out. I finally got the ND powder on Black Friday and it blew my mind away. I'm on the dry side and almost 50 years old so I do have some fine lines, but this didn't accentuate my pores nor my fine lines. The shade match was perfect and it went on very smooth with the applicator which came with it. I put some concealer on my dark spot and put this powder on top and it did warm up a bit and it still looked like my skin, without needing too much a setting mist!! It will be my go to!
I gave a 4 star since it is pricey and it will be nice if they sold extra applicators separately. If I used a large powder brush, it did have some fall outs. * At first I thought I had chosen the wrong shade. I did what the ND website said and based my choice on my skin tone in indirect daylight. That shade is significantly paler than my skin in artificial light. 

When I applied the powder, it looked so white on me I felt like I was cosplaying a French aristocrat. I sprayed myself with setting spray and hoped for the best. 10-20 minutes later, the makeup was no longer chalky white. It matched my skin tone perfectly. 

I have oily skin, and this foundation doesn't separate as much as other foundations do after eight hours. It looks like my skin, and it feels like im wearing no makeup at all! It doesnt even feel like I'm wearing makeup when I touch my face! This foundation definitely lives up to its price.

I will say, it definitely seems like it was designed with dry sponges and powder puffs in mind. When I applied it with a powder brush, it was very easy to layer too much on an area with my brushstrokes. I guess I'm used to sheer to medium powders, not medium to heavy. * please make a liquid foundation * Ive bought this multiple time shade range and product is amazing * Ive bought this multiple time shade range and product is amazing * I have olive undertones, but I usually can get away with wearing foundation shades labeled ""neutral"". That was NOT the case, with this. I bought NP13 and then NP14, and they both pulled VERY red, on me. Like, red clay soil, red. I really liked the formula though, so I gave it one last shot and ordered Y13. It is a good match. It is a little yellow on me, but I can get away with it pretty well. This foundation lasts all day without priming or setting. I have combo skin, so this starts off looking matte & poreless; & then looks satiny after my oils start peeking through after a few hours - I love both. I get so many compliments on my skin, when I wear it. Not my makeup, my SKIN. It also didn't flare up my perioral dermatitis, which obviously is a massive plus. IMO, the only thing that would make this foundation better is an improved shade range, & a version with fuller coverage. Other than that, this is a fantastic powder- which is saying something, coming from someone who greatly prefers liquid foundation."

It's also light so doesn't feel gross or greasy in south Florida humidity. The look is fresh and plumped and lets your real skin peek through.  I set it with Bye Bye Pores by IT--especially under my eyes so my mascara doesn't transfer. I'm a bit oily in the T zone so by 4pm my nose is pretty shiny and it starts to break up a little but still looks better on my 50 YO skin than heavier makeup. Would suggest for average work days and running errands on weekends. The bottle is TERRIBLE. Not only do you end up wasting a lot of product but the liquid ends up dripping down the side of the bottle and it makes a real mess. Would be much better if they got rid of the eye dropper. Even a squeeze bottle would be better. * Was in the market for a buildable skin like foundation that wasn't so costly. Upon trying this foundations it met all expectations and above. Was very skin like and buildable. Alone, it gave me the coverage that I was looking for without being to much. * For me just another foundation.  Color choices were not easy to work with, so difficult to tell how 
Well it worked, * I have been using this tinted serum since 2022! I love the light airbrush finish. This product blends well and is buildable. I find myself reaching for this over my foundation. I achieve a very natural look with this tinted moistuizer and it even covers up redness. Pro tip - rub the product in your palm before applying to your face. The dropper can be messy but over time it becomes easier to use. * I love this so much its great for dry skin, my only complaint is that i am extremely pale and the lightest color is too dark for me. PLEASE make a lighter shade for the pasty peeps * - Buildable coverage
- Seamlessly blends into skin
- Extremely hydrating and blurring
- Friendly for acne-prone skin * The color was perfect. I thought it would be impossible to find a good match without testers. I like the consistency. It looks very natural on my face. A little goes a long way. The glass eyedrop container gets messy. I think a squeeze tube would be better."

If you a more natural look, you can mix it with a moisturizer. The smell might be a bit off putting, but it's not bad. The only con is it is expensive. * I am a ride or die ELF girl, and I seldom try other brands because of it. But I've been hearing a ton about this product, and had a gift card so I wanted to give it a try. I am really impressed. The converage is really a stand out for me. I'm always trying to cover redness around my chin, purples under my eyes, and minor acne scarring, one layer of this leaves me completley smooth, and porcelin like. Blushes and bronzers blend seamlessly. My only gripe is for some reason I can't find a concealer that doesn't pill with it, whether under the foundation, or over. But honestly, you almost dont need concealer with this unless you're highlighting certain areas. All and all, I totally recommend and will be purchasing again :) * Couldn't be happier with this foundation. I normally struggle with my makeuo separating or coming off throughout the day but this foundation didnt budge! * I would definitely recommend if you want true full coverage. Im nearing 50 and I have no problems with this settling into lines or accentuating my pores. I use a BHA exfoliant prior and with this my skin looks flawless! * After using this foundation for years, ive never wanted to try another foundation. Ive probably been through at least 10 bottles. I often get compliments on the airbrushed look of my skin. The product feels breathable, yet also has full coverage! I have occasional breakouts and redness and it covers both issues perfectly! Also, i live at a very dry climate and have no issues with patchiness of product. 10/10! * I've spent a lot of money on different foundations over the years and this is by far the best one! I was so excited when Ulta started carrying charlotte tilbury because ife been using this foundation exclusively foe the past 3 years. The product lasts me several months. I apply a layer once in the morning and it lasts all day! * Ive tried so many foundations, but this one takes the cake. The best coverage for the least amount of product, doesnt make my face itch and lasts all day!!

I apply it with a brush, and it blends seamlessly into my skin, creating a smooth, even base with minimal effort. A little goes a long way—just a small amount delivers excellent coverage without feeling heavy. However, I've noticed it's not ideal for oily skin, as it can break down throughout the day in shinier areas. For normal to dry skin types, though, this is a game-changer! * This stuff never seems to dry, it goes on terribly, breaks up and slides all over my face.  I had high hopes, I loved the discontinued LM foundation.   This isnt it though. * I gave this away. I used to use the crème foundation and loved it.

An ULTA assistant pointed me in the direction of Laura Mercier's tinted moisturizer with SPF, which has been great (I'm on my third tube—each has lasted me about 9 months with daily use).

I have dry/normal skin, a light-medium olive skintone, and I deal with dullness/discoloration. Shade 2N1 is a good shade match for me. I've enjoyed using this with a dense foundation brush. It's easy to sheer out or build up. I would describe it as light/medium coverage. It evens out my skin tone, but doesn't cover blemishes. Its very comfortable on the skin, it feels like a moisturizer, the consistency is thick at first, but it doesn't feel like anything when blended out. I can wear it without powder and it stays on all day for me. Definitely repurchasing. * I've been using this product for years!  I don't like thick heavy coverage so this is very light buildable coverage.  I have pretty good skin, 38 years old, cheeks are pink from dryness with few blemishes and this provides me full coverage.  I do add a thin layer of moisturizer (especially now that I'm older and less oily) and concealer for under my eyes, nose and any glaring blemishes.  It's a very natural finish that does pull warm.  I use 2N1 for my winter everyday color and 2W1 for summer when I'm tanned (it's very yellow/gold). * The Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer goes on nicely,  bur doesnt cover ANY imperfections. Some pilling.  I was hoping to love it, but will be returning it."

This foundation is also way too shiny, and rubs off easily while trying on clothes etc. Not a fan at all I'm switching to Nars. Very disappointed; I have been a Mac fan for SO Long. If you are fair skinned be warned that the formula has changed, maybe if you have never used this you'll be happy, but as a long time user of this I've moved on. Would not repurchase and wish I could get my money back. * NC5 - Non-irritating, comfortable. Clings to dry patches and looks powdery and flakey, more than other brands. I exfoliate, moisturize, but don't use primers. I apply with my fingers, so maybe it would look better with more prep or darker shades. * The finish of this foundation is beautiful and people consistently comment on how gorfeous my slin is wheb wearing it. I apply eith a buffing brush and over the winter Ive added sn extra drop of hyaluronic acid (already an ingredient so it blends right in). My skin looks radiant, and thats a difficult accomplishment at 57.  

Issues to watch out for: this foundation has no sunscreen, apply a good protective sunscreen prior to the foundatipn. The undertones are labled in what many would consider backwards. ""C"" does not mean cool, from their description it's a warm tome. Same for ""W"", which is describedss a cool tone. Keep in mind when looking for a shade. * Daughter used for her latest dance competition and it held up all day beer the lights with minimal touch ups * It is so hard to find a foundation that works with dry skin and works well with very hydrating under makeup skin prep but this is one if the best foundations I have gound for dry skin. Doesnt cling to dry patches. Covers evenly. Very easy to apply and a little goes a long way! * This product is too thick and heavy. I did not like it at all."

This foundation is excellent for women who ate experiencing wrinkles, oiliness, uneven skin, etc. I have some wrinkles, extreme oily skin, break outs, and skin disorders. This covers everything and stays perfectly in place all day! It does NOT settle in wrinkles! It is buildable! Easy to apply! 

Throwing out my MAC and Clinique and keeping Chanel! 

Only wish were they had paler not goldeny shades, since winter ive gotten whiter and my color no longer matches and doesn't come in a lighter shade.

If you're on the fence you will be really happy with this!! * Long wear and the best color for medium skin tone * Long wear and the best color for medium skin tone * I've tried every foundation under the sun for oily skin and this is the only one that works for me. I still do need to touch up, but not too often. I pair it with the Secure the Sweat primer and Matte Milani Setting Spray and my makeup stays all day! * I love this foundation. I'm 45 years old and whenever I wear this foundation, I get so many compliments on how beautiful my ""skin"" is. * So nice and smooth foundation it's easy to apply and quickly blend with skin and it's looks classy * Even the lightest shade is no where near light enough.

Do not buy! * I was expecting a little more coverage but does feel like skin. It looks beautiful but on acne days not even with a few layers it doesn't add to much coverage. * I'm so impressed by this foundation and have told all my friends about it. My skin looks incredible with it on and it applies so nicely, very light but great coverage! I dont even wear concealer with it! I put on a light moisturizer (I use Caudalie vinoperfect) and then apply the foundation with a brush. 5 stars!!! * This may be the worst foundation I've ever tried; I could not get this to apply correctly-i tried a brush, sponge and my fingers-there was just no applying this stuff. It was somewhat watery but I could not get it to spread on my face-i don't think I've ever had that happen with a foundation.  I wish I could give it 0 stars. * Looks very nice on * The best!"

But it's great! * This foundation stick has buildable coverage and feels so smooth. * Love this! Just tried it and fell in love. But too expensive for me to wear daily. * I purchased this foundation after looking for something to match my skin tone during the winter months. This provides night coverage without feeling heavy. You do need to adequately prep and hydrate your skin or it will not look good. I like blending it with a beauty blender instead of thd brush. The one weird thing about the color is that I purchased 215N, which you cant find anywhere online, but it is available in stores. It is the perfect color for me as i have light-medium skin with an olive/neautral undertone. One bonus is that this is great for travel and can be multipurpose as a concealer as well. * I have fair skin and I have non-segmental vitiligo. This product covers the areas around my mouth and eyes well.  I use it for days I don't want to apply a full amount of dermablend.  The coverage is rally great."

Very confusing * I had really high hopes for this  foundation. After researching foundations for mature skin online, I decided to purchase Lancome's Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care and Glow Foundation. This is a very thick foundation and there is nothing glowy about it. It looks cakey and doesn't illuminate. The smell was weird, too. It is medium to full coverage. I was previously using Estee Lauder's Futurist Hydra Foundation and thought I'd expand my toolkit for something different, and perhaps better. The grass isn't always greener. I am disappointed and will be returning the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear Care and Glow Foundation. * I tried the foundation cuz I have mature skin. It goes on really nice and the color is well. But within 4 hours it wears off in your face looks like it never had any foundation on it. I even used setting spray. also done at the count as the second ingredient. My skin is sensitive dimethicone, it's also a nasty ingredient. either way this is going back. * First time trying this foundation and super impressed."

I have normal to dry skin and live in an exceedingly dry/high altitude/cold climate and provides medium coverage and does not settle into lines. Natural and very skin like finish.

Thankfully no hyaluranic acid (important because this worsens dryness on your face if you are in a dry climate). No fragrance.  Will buy again. * One of the worst foundations I've used it seperates so bad and oxidizes once worm for a while. After about an hour you family will be extremely oily * I have sensitive combination skin and this foundation actually works really well for me. I am in the shade Neutral1, I believe. I am also a powder over foundation person, but I do find the finish to be skin-like. I feel like this foundation would probably not work the best on oily skin. I don't find it to be patchy, but I also use the Charlotte Tilbury setting mist after light powdering. All-in-all, I really like it. My other foundation is Lancôme and I would say the coverage is the same, but actually (due to Lancôme having SPF) it feels lighter on my skin, so I do like that, as well. I would purchase again, as it's inexpensive and pretty good! * Im 49, and have never had an exact shade match until now. Love Halsey and her line, was blown away by the match. This is thd first foundation i have seen offering a true olive undertone in every shade. I'm light medium 2 olive and it is beautiful. If has a soft natural finish, wears like a skin tint, solid medium coverage. This is very buildable, and looks like skin. If wears really well, I am a chef and it holds up through a busy work night. 10/10 would recommend. * my fav foundation. very affordable. definetly clean girl friendly * The shade match was spot on, check your undertones! That being said, the application is not great. This product needs a pump and it dried down to quickly. We would benefit from an easier was to apply. Returned to Ulta, not worth the hassle."

A little goes a long way but it lasts all day. * I've been using Charlotte Tilbury's Beautiful Skin Foundation, and it's seriously a game-changer. It gives me that glowy, natural finish without feeling heavy – like my skin, just way more radiant. I love how it evens everything out while still looking fresh! * I would use this product again. * Today I got this foundation and used it as soon as I got home. When i went to go pump it I probably pumped it about 10 times just to get some foundation, it is nice looking, but i am returning this, it is too expensive for what you get. * I am not a big makeup person, but I love this foundation. It covers my pores and blend so beautifully with my skin covers my acne and doesn't upset my sensitive skin. * Was too thick for my skin, every wrinkle and crease was showing, making me look older. * Maybe it's my mature skin, maybe I could try a different primer or moisturizer and I would love it, but I really want a foundation that performs well on it's own. I wanted to love it - tried different variations of with/without primer, moisturizer, powder, and setting spray. It looked good from a distance but close up it separated and emphasized dry areas. They'll be no encore for this one, curtain closed - it's going back."

As an oily skin girly, i love the matte finish. Will definitely buy again and again. * My skin tends to be sensituve, and I used this foundation thinking this product and the ingredients were the best because it's ""Dior"". After using it for a few days (before realizing it was the problem), my face brone out in hives and cystic acne that unlike anything I have ever experienced. It was so bad, I didn't leave my house for a week! Now I am left with scars on my face that could take years to recover from. I dont know if it's the ethylhexyl salicylate, alcohol, or mystery frangance in this ish, but I wouldn't wish what happened to me on my worst enemy. Dont touch this stuff with a 10 ft pole!!!

I'm trying not to hold it against ""Dior"" or Ulta, but the fact that they're even letting this stuff stay on the market baffles me. Dont use this. * If you have tried the YSL matte foundation and you're looking for a less expensive version this is it! It smells amazing, has the SPF and stays on matte. I live in AZ where if is hot and this does not feel heavy or cakey. * I decided to try this foundation after seeing reviews on YouTube. But it does not live up to the reviews. It is not transfer proof, and it rubs off so easily. If you touch your face, it's smearing. I may have to go back to bare minerals. * The foundation itself is great. It goes on smooth and it last long it is not greasy or oily. The pump keeps clogging, every few days when I dispense it shoots out at angles, it gets on my clothes, and I have to change last minute. It gets on the wall… its very frustrating. It is good make up, but if I am spending this much money, the packaging should be good too."

Its super natural looking, blends well, isnt dry or anything. I love the Clinique brand the only reason im switching it for another clinique foundation is becuase i want more coverage, but other than that, totally recommend. * I bought this 2 days ago on recommendation of a clinique employee at Ulta. I was color matched and in the store it looked fine. I used it for the first time this morning, approximately 45 minutes ago. I just looked in the mirror and my face is orange. I've never seen a foundation oxidized this fast. it's horrible. I'm going to be returning it as soon as possible. this is truly an awful product and I can't express enough. please stay away. express enough. Please stay away. * Only 5 minutes into wearing for the first time. So far I really like it. * I want to start this out by saying i have hotrible cystic acne. I got this in hopes it would cover my acne while also treating my skin. All it does was make my acne extremeley angry and dry my fave out horribly. If you have acne prone skin- i would NOT recommend putting this on your face * This product doesn't make my acne worse. It blends well and gives just the right amount of coverage. You can apply multiple layers for more coverage if needed. I recommend going into Ulta to get color matched for this foundation. That's what I did and they matched it perfectly for me. * I havent worn foundation in over two years because everything would break me out. I finally found this foundation and absolutely love it!

Great shade selections, which is always appreciated.  Reasonably priced.  My go to stick foundation. * I really love this foundation stick. I dont, however, think the price fits the quantity. Should be double of the actual amount for the nearly $40 price tag or be less expensive for this amount. * I love this stick.  Travels well.  Its buildable which I love.  And it lays nicely on my old face. Haha!   I have recommended this to friends and they love it as well because if it's versatility and that it plays nice with aging skin. * I ordered this product in shade 6 almost a year ago and just reordered it in the same shade. It came in and the shade is completely different than it was originally. Had to return. * The color match for me was perfect. But the formula on my skin was awful. It clung to my dry spots so bad so it looks dry and patchy and sunk into pores. I returned it today. * As a former oily girly and now a bit older and need a light foundation but without completely drying me out. It feels like putting butter on your skin. I used this for my college graduation and I am so glad I purchased it. I am pretty pale and the shade was perfect but also made my skin look great.

It is full coverage and so easy to apply. It leaves my skin with a smooth and matte finish that doesn't look cakey at all. By the end of the day, my skin still looks really good. * I'm picky about everything. I have reactive sensitive skin, so I approach new products with caution. I am fair skinned but I have a lot of surface redness. For years I was color matched as cool and could not understand why products chosen by pros never looked right. I'm neutral but not muted, an oddly difficult shade to find with a true match. Most brands don't actually have this many color options on either end of the spectrum, so I was super pleased and shocked to have two choices, 120 and 125. They both workwd but 125 was really quite perfect. I generally prefer a slightly dewier finish, but the finish on this is so natural looking. I use a primer and UD setting spray to set. It stays in place all day and has never broken, pilled, or transferred nor has it caused my skin to break out once. My blush and highlighter sit nicely on top of it. Since my previous holy grail by Dior seems to be distcontinued, this Fenty foundation has become my new go-to. I'll try the concealer soon too. * Im 51 and im in love with this foundation. The shade ranges are sooo good. Im super fair with a grayish under tone…..150 is the perfect match.  Oddly enough, its been easier to find my match in korean beauty brands (nars, Lancôme, estee lauder, laura mercier, have all been misses). The finish is so pretty and there us something special about finding the perfect match. 50 shade ranges with a great formula…well done Fenty. * The formula on this wasn't great. I feel like it's very pigmented BUT you need alot of product to build it to look nice. It seem more dry than my usual go to. Not sure if using fenty primer would work better. It doesn't have a bad smell. Just not my favorite at all * To be honest I got the shade 230 and it blended really well with my skin. The packaging was cute and the foundation didn't have any scent to it which is good. The blend-ability is not the Best But I think it will be good for people who likes a natural glow look. The coverage was great like it kind of covered my redness and pimple skin. * The first few times i tried this foundation i didnt really like it because the color seemed different. I found that putting it on the back of your hand warming it up with your fingers then applying on your face with fingers and blending with a brush made all the difference. It looked very skin like and the color was as advertised when i used that method. This is now my favorite foundation!"

It is very skin like and doesn't make my dry patches more noticeable! best application is with a foundation brush, but you can always use your hands, either works! Will say it doesn't play well with one of my cream blushes, and smudges, but it could be user error so take that with a pinch of salt. All in all havent had any major issues yet. * Applies easily. No streaks. Glowing skin (Not too glowy). Have been compliments on my makeup since I've been using it. * I really wanted to like this. When using it, my fave broke out. * I have dry skin and this skin tint feels very natural and hydrating on. The coverage is on the lighter side so it doesn't cover all imperfections. It does look very natural on me and can be a little oily if you don't set with powder. * This us my go- to product for a natural every day look. Lightweight and natural, perfecting while complimenting my skin. 5 stars! * This is so tiny that i was a bit shocked. I'm a huge fan of Hourglass and wanted something for those days when i dont feel like going full coverage. I spread this with my hands rather than foundation brush (although i do blend a little using a brush after applying). Its very light but definite coverage. 

It feels very lightweight, which i like. I have been using this as a full foundation just like i would use my normal foundation (setting powder + setting spray). I feel that my face looks more natural than when i wear full foundation. 

But it's just so tiny and expensive that i just dont know if ill repurchase. * I'll admit up front that I'm a product junkie. Skincare is super important to me and I believe that also involves having the best makeup that compliments your features, not hides them. I am in my early 40's and I've probably tried most foundations, sparing no cost to have that flawless ""I woke up this way"" skin. I began to move away from medium to full coverage foundation recently and tried Mac moisturizing tint coverage (dewy) and I loved it. The con- too dewy for me. I have oily skin and I was tired of always blotting my T-zone. I decided to give Hourglass Tint a try based on the positive reviews. Within the first week I was getting compliments on my skin daily. People didn't believe me at first that I wasn't wearing foundation, just tint. No more overly oily T-zone either.  I work in healthcare, so I'm in a lot of people's faces often. I even had someone hand me their phone to search the exact product I used. This tint will be my main go-to from now on."

Absolutely not worth the money. Dont believe the fake social media hype. Its a trash product * I bought this for something long wearing and to have a semi natural finish. great product * I gave two stars because the shade match actually worked for me. Nothing else did.

This is so easy to apply and looks great on.  To set, which really helps with a powder foundation, I just mist with water.  The refillable compact is great too. * Yall. Name a skin type…i have it. Lol. But serously this beautiful powder is by far the best powder foundation i have ever tried and i have tried nearly all of them. You can sheer it out for a set or finish or pack it on for a full coverage moment. All wirhout looking dry or cakey. It is the first powder i don't immediately reach for a setting spray to ""melt"" it. You can. But you dont have to. This conpany is also on my good list for being loudly and proudly prochoice. Love it. * I'm a powder foundation junky. I hate liquid foundation so much. So I always use powder foundation. The reason I LOVE this foundations are 1) long lasting wear 2) doesn't look cakey at all 3) but still has great coverage without looking heavy 4) color matches my skin tone very well. I have tried from cheap to high end ones and I say this is one of the best. I have one more favorite but I'm keeping it as my beauty secret! * I'm in my late 30s and was looking for a powder that wouldn't sink into my fine lines, and lasted. This was not it. The coverage is too transparent, so you have to use a lot of get better coverage, and then it doesn't have any staying power. Maybe it's my skin or my primer that doesn't work well with it, but for the price I wasn't impressed. * I have used PUR Cosmetics pressed powder foundation for 5+ years, but it has retinol in it and I'm pregnant. I tried several other brands of powder foundations (Bare Minerals, Lancome, Maybelline) and they all looked so patchy, cakey, and horrible. I tried this as a last-ditch effort, and I'm so glad I did! This is a fantastic pressed powder foundation. It applies easily, doesn't look patchy, doesn't look cakey, doesn't settle into my fine lines, and provides decent light/medium coverage. This has a very nice semi-matte finish, and looks very natural on the skin with a feather-light texture. I will say PUR's product offers a little more coverage in my opinion, but this product is still amazing. I love the ingredients, and I love the refillable compact concept. I highly recommend this!

Quick pick me up * Im so picky with foundations i went to ulta and tried this one on and loved it. I was suprised that the 230N matched my skin, cause im a medium skin tone. This is listed as being very light but it matched skin perfectly. I really love the coverage and would purchase again."
69,tarte,babassu foundcealer dewy foundation spf 20,pimprod2006408,2542892," * awesome product: full coverage, hydrating, dewy finish (especially when paired with hydrating primer), not irritating for my sensitive acne prone skin. ONLY con is I have to order my shade online, Ulta doesn't carry in store, what's up with that?! * This was a really great substitute for Clinique Even Better Glow. Has such a beautiful finish and is so smooth! I hope they never discontine! * It's so great that Tarte has vegan products because I have a mammal allergy and have to have all vegan products. Thank you! * This foundation is moisturizing and provides good coverage. I like the color, although I did get help from one of the employees at Ulta. It's a good match for my skin. It's a bit shiny so I do need to use powder, but when I do, it gives my face a nice glow. * I love it. It was so good. It feels like IL makiage make up. * Blends amazing with my skin tone and texture and is so easy to apply, would definitely recommend. It doesn't make your face feel weighed down and doesn't even feel like I'm wearing makeup. I don't use much, but it still feels great on my face. * The coverage was great. Not too heavy. Definitely would purchase again."
70,tula,radiant skin brightening serum skin tint spf 30,pimprod2032850,2598954," * As someone who used to wear heavy foundation that turned orange and always oxidized, this is my new favorite product. This skin tint is amazing and makes your skin so glowy and gorgeous. Ive gotten so many compliments when I go to work. * I have been searching for a light foundation or tinted moisturizer that didn't leave my cheeks dry. This stuff is absolutely amazing. Leaves me with the dewy, moisturized look I've been wanting! * If youre looking for a glowy full coverage foundation this is the one! * I wanted to love this so bad! Im a south florida girlie so sometimes I want just slight coverage with my spf and to look like a glowy, beachy queen but this product is terrible. I have pretty balanced skin, no acne, occasionally some slight dryness in the T-zone but this product (regardless of the amount used) made me look dry and greasy at the same time and was so patchy. It doesnt feel like it blends in to an even layer with hands, brush or blender. If you get somewhere ""even"" it just looks like you have nothing but oil on. Just sits on the skin, very heavy. If you try to set it, it gets worse. * This skin tint is my all time favorite! * This tinted moisturizer feels heavier than my Estee Lauder Double Wear. The coverage is good but shade 2 pulls way orange and dark. Overall, just not that impressed for the price. I'd go back to L'Oreal's Tinted Serum if it was light enough for my pale winter self. * I don't wear much by way of foundations as they often just sit on my skin, don't blend in, and look patchy. Also, I don't need much coverage; I just need to even out my skin tone. The only products that have worked gor me in the past is Glossier's balm concealer and skin tint. 

This product fits my needs. It blends in well, it light coverage, doesn't sit heavy, or detract from from my natural skin. It has excellent shade ranges (at least at the light end of the spectrum), making it easy to find a more neutral tone. It doesn't also sit in the small wrinkles under my eyes, calling attention to them. 

A little bit does go a long way. I use about a pea sized amount to cover my whole face. This renders the sunscreen aspect useless, but as I alway apply sunscreen as a separate part of my skincare routine, its a non-issue for me."
71,mac,studio fix fluid spf15 24hr matte foundation + oil control,pimprod2044825,2622175," * After reading all the reviews ,I know I wasn't exaggerating about how terrible this new formula is! Nobody likes it! Bring back the original please! The new one is cakey, oily but dry at the same time, like how!? Moves all over and doesn't stay or last. Makes my skin look older, just awful! It was embarrassing to go out wearing it seeing how bad it looked after just applying it! As if that wasn't enough, it broke me out so much! * So disappointed when I tried the new formula.I gave it so many chances with different skin preps. Disappointment every time.It was actually embarrassing to have to wear it the entire day cuz it looked so bad! The ""great reviews"" must be bots or compensation. * Who actually thinks this is a great foundation?! It's awful, I thought it was a knock off! At this point, with this price tag, a drugstore foundation would be better. New formula doesn't stay on, creases, cakes, gets oily and settles on every line * Terrible! This new formula makes you look both dry AND oily! How can it actually be this bad!? Lol!
Accentuates every fine line and pore on your face. Transfers at the slightest touch, it does not stay on. MAC dropped the ball on this one big time! * I LOVE, LOVE  this foundation! I've been using this product for at least 11 years, and I even if I try to change to another product I always come back. I'm now 37 years old and this is the only foundation that works with my normal/combination skin. * I would start by calling this a good foundation for a special occasion. I don't know that I would wear it on the daily because while it has a comfortable wear, it definitely feels like my skin has less breathing room than it would with a lighter foundation. That said, this foundation definitely holds up to MAC's standards of high coverage and high longevity, and I was shocked to actually find a shade that matched my skin perfectly. I bought this to use as bridesmaid makeup and my face lasted from 10am Saturday to 1am Sunday on a 75-degree day in Mexico. For reference, my skin tends to be neutral but leans very slightly oily. I can't speak for how this foundation will hold up if you have oily skin or dry patches, but it definitely held up well to some mild oil buildup throughout the day * Silky smooth and light."
72,l'orÃ©al,infallible 24h fresh wear foundation in a powder,pimprod2021871,2575170," * I've been wearing this for probably a solid 10 years and will continue to wear it until they don't make it anymore or until I keel over, lol! Great price great coverage great product! * I love this compact. The product works so well on top of foundation or on its own. It was my go to powder until i had startrd swimming. I have 4 different shades and not one works 330 is a tad too dark, but 300 is too light. 260 and 250 are currently too light, but are for when im not swimming * This is definitely one of the better pressed powder foundations out there.  It applies smoothly and looks natural, and shockingly i found a great color match (golden sun, im normally mac nc42-45 depending on the season).  Tips for application: start with properly moisturized skin.  I found using the included puff (or similar) AND using gentle pressure (dont drag it) to swipe and pat product in the skin provides best coverage.  Then use a brush if necessary to even it out.  Apply other powder product over it, and use a setting spray to finish and it should not look powdery/dry.  My only issue is staying power, but that is a problem i have with face products across the board (i tend to touch my face, blow my nose a lot throughout the day) * I started buying this since the other brand I was using has raised their prices so much. I don't plan on going back! The reason for 4 stars is it runs out fast. * I have combination skin and larger pores. This powder over my moisturizer looks at the first sight super good but when you go into the sunlight and have better light it looks awful. It gives a very unnatural look and makes your pores look bigger. * This powder emphasized my texture and looked cake. * This gives great coverage and doesnt look cakey. I use this as a finishing powder and it gives longevity to my makeup. I also used it for touch ups for a wedding day (12 hour wear!)"
73,chanel,les beiges water-fresh tint,pimprod2030055,2574253," * It is light. The coverage was perfect for me. * Love this product so much, I would by it again * This is a dream product. It covers just enough to even out skin tone and provide a healthy glow. It looks like my skin. * When I say I've tried a lot of different skin tints, I'm not exaggerating. Ive tried everything from fenty, chantecaille, YSL, Tower 28, caliray, tula, etc.
There is NOTHING like this product. It is truly one of a kind. Its sheer but somehow stays all day. Has a gorgeous finish and is a true no makeup-makeup staple. * This is the first product I've found that works on my aged skin. Blends beautifully, looks pretty natural and DOES NOT show my small lines and deep wrinkles any worse.  Because it's super moisturizing some of my lines actually look better. The longer the day does, the better it sets. Love this product. * Like the name says, this is just a tint. Its not buildable. Perfect for my no makeup days. Leaves a very pretty glow. No spf so it feels very lightweight. I'm on my second one. I wear the shade medium, in other chanel foundations I wear bd31. * I wouldnt call this foundation exactly , but with proper skin care this is it. I exfoliate daily, moisturize after serum and use this as my foundation. It completely evens out my skin tone and adds a subtle glow. I use medium. Its slighty warmer than my natural tone and perfectly watms up my skin. Doesnt crack or cake into pores and with a nice setting powder over top , my skin looks great. I tried to go back to a heavier foundation on a night i wqs going out and regretted the entire night. Especially after a few hours. I wont be without this new brilliant product from chanel."
74,clinique,even better refresh hydrating and repairing makeup foundation,pimprod2004194,2541677," * This foundation does not settle into my lines, I love it! * I have been looking for a bew foundation that would look smooth on my dry skin! This makes my skin look so good and fresh! * Love my Clinique foundation. Also love the packaging! At first I thought it was so different from my past foundation packaging, but absolutely love the convenience and ease of using the tube that just fits in your hand! * I must admit that I didn't expect to like this foundation, but I did purchase it because I don't know how to say no thank you.  When I got home my husband complimented me.  He thought I looked so rested and refreshed!  What ???  I've been wearing this foundation for two weeks now and have gotten compliments on my complexion from total strangers!  Why not give it a try. * Goes on easily, blends perfectly. Slightly lighter than my normal color so I mix them. * It took me years to find a good color match foundation that also plays well with my mostly dry but still combo skin. I LOVE this foundation! I do have to make sure I use a moisturizer, primer, and setting spray, but when i do, it goes on amazing and looks and feelz natural all day long. The perfect mid coverage for dry skin. Don't know what some of these reviews are saying…it does not oxidize (you just have the wrong shade) and it's definitely not chalky. * I like using this foundation.  Great coverage , yet feels light on my skin.  I have been using it for a few years."
75,kvd beauty,good apple skin-perfecting hydrating foundation balm,pimprod2022990,2577085," * The coverage is good but my skin breakout everytime I was it. My skin gets so greasy everytime I wear this. It doesnt matter how much powder I use my face is too shiny. Its a no fo me * Nice coverage for photos. Nice so far for middle aged skin, -combination to slightly dry. * Can't give enough stars love love love this * I have oily skin so this product isn't made for me but I still LOVE it. Full coverage but feels light. Foundation fixes itself and improves throughout the day. The most beautiful finish I have ever seen!! * I bought this product from a beauty store because I absolutely loved how it felt going on (tried it on my wrist). I was siked to apply this make up once I got home. I applied it and within minutes my eyes were burning! Burning! Tossed it in the pile of misfit make up but then decided that maybe it was a fluke and tried it again some months later. The BURNING, oh the BURNING!!!!!!! I have no idea what's in it to give me this kind of reaction but I've never had this happen with any foundation I've tried before. * I have dry skin, so I assumed this balm would work well for my skin type, as I see oily-skinned people saying it is too oily for them. I use a lot of skincare and made sure to moisturize before applying this (as well as a hydrating primer) but it still looked incredibly dry and cakey on my skin. I tried a foundation brush and a beauty sponge, but it didn't seem to look nice no matter what I did. It genuinely looked so horrible, even my boyfriend who rarely notices anything like that noted that it did not flatter my skin. So if this is not for oily skin types and not for dry skin types, who is it for? * Love it💝"
76,chanel,les beiges healthy glow foundation hydration and longwear,pimprod2030080,2571508," * I went into Ulta to buy my NARS Macao and a manager encouraged me to try a couple other colors she thought would be a better fit for a brown girl with warm, yellow undertones. B130 was a flawless match. Highly reccomend * I'm so glad i went ahead and bought this, it is so pretty on the skin and feels like nothing. Its covers what i need it to, and blends in seamless. * This foundation is one of my top foundations to wear. It is glowy and melts into the skin beautifully. I haven't found a single problem, it has worked well with other products, I will continue to buy it for sure! * Looks and feels like my skin I get so many compliments on this foundation when I wear it.

I would highly recommend this product * This product is amazing * I'm on my 2nd bottle of this foundation and I rarely buy something twice as I'm always looking for my next holy grail. So that's a statement! It's that good! It's pricey, yes but I always find myself reaching for it over my other many foundations because it always makes my dry mature skin look good. And isn't that why we wear foundation? It's a natural finish with a slight glow and a subtle blurring effect. Not overly dewy or greasy at all. I think any skin type could wear this but it does contain fragrance if that's a deal breaker. Chanel doesn't always have the best shade range but I was able to find a good shade match in this formula. I consider this a light but buildable coverage. Try it. It's worth the price. * I have kept this in my foundation rotation for a few years now. It's one of my daily go to's. I use bd31, great match for my light medium skin tone. Medium coverage, buildable. I have normal/dry skin and this sets really nicely and gives a good radiance. I get 8-10 hours of wear, do use the les beiges powder with it as well. Dry skin ladies, give it a try!!"

I've seen other reviews talking about it being cakey and other negative things but if you know how to properly prep your face before applying foundation (this applies to ANY foundation) then you will LOVE this brand. I have Very sensitive skin and hate the feel of foundation on my face but I don't mind this one at all! You get a full coverage and it's lightweight. I've been using this brand for a year and I'm truly impressed. * I love this foundation i just which the shades would expand in store. The coverage and longevity is insane. I have replaced my double wear with this foundation. It's cheaper and better. I love how the wand is on the inside so that i can use it also as a concealer…Also there is primer and skincare in this foundation!!! * I really need a gluten free foundation, and this isn't worth the money. Like others have said, it looks cakey. Somehow it LOOKS dry, but it slides right off like it's an oil. Settled into every freaking line and ended up looking like bad Halloween makeup. I will give it one more chance - going to try it without moisturizer underneath, because it was hard to wash off the back of my hand. If it still sucks, it's getting returned. * Should have researched before I bought it. Similar to other reviews, sales associate recommended this brand. I tried to convince myself it was ok, but it just wasnt. My coworkers kept asking me if i felt ok bevause I was so pale. It doesnt last, very cakey (I look like a girl from the movie White Chicks) and shows EVERY SINGLE pore and crease you may have. Such a bummer. Returned. Sales associates must get a kick-back because this product just isnt good and shouldn't be promoted. * Should have researched before I bought it.

I have olive undertones and its one of the only prodacts that i can find with neutral undertone color that sits well with it. I never look too warm or blue or grey. Specially with my winter skin tone color. In the summer, i know i can find my exact match with my olive undertone too and it looks amazing. I wish it was cheaper but the finish is so natural and pretty and photopgraghs so well. I always get told how great my skin looks when wear it out and no one suspects im wearing a full face because its so light weight and so ""your skin but better"" looking. I LOVE IT * Good coverage, very strong scent, very runny"

Im not sure if it was my skincare routine that did not react well with the makeup or what. Have to return * I purchased this after the Ulta employee assured me this perfomed the same as Nars Radiant foundation. Could not be more opposite! This adds texture to my skin and is super patchy. And it separates after an hour. I tried all the different application methods and none worked. I used the primers suggested, the using my fingers instead of a brush or sponge, i tried it all. Nothing worked. Its the foundation. Will be going back to my ABH luminous foundation. * I am in my  60's and I was using Lorac Porefection, but it's no longer available. I've tried to find something that didn't look drying or sink into my fine lines. I like a glowy look. I tried Laura Geller for amture skin and hated it, way too dry looking for me. I love this Nars light reflecting is the perfect coverage, not heavy or cakey and does give your skin a glowy look all day. * This is my new favorite foundation. It is buildable, blend-able and lightweight. The result looks fresh and bright. * Recently got this. I had mac studio fix previously but needed a new shade for winter and wasn't in love with the way it looked on my skin. So the gal at Ulta recommended this one for my combination, 32 year old skin. Love that i can build it up to full coverage or wear it really sheer for a natural finish depending on my preference, also i do not need concealer to cover scarring this covers so well when i buff a lil more foundation onto those particular areas. Even if i buff some more under my eyes it looks nice for an everyday natural look rather than a thick concealer. I DO have large pores and acne scarring snd it looks beautiful on my skin. Ive heard some women say it enhances their pores and textured skin but imo a specified primer would help some with that but you could only do so much regardless ya know.. So ive just accepted my skin the way it is and it looks beautiful on my skin not cakey. I do not set my skin, and after the end of a long day like mad woman, with 4 kiddos, it still looks so beautiful and covers my flaws so freakin well. Hope this review helps. :) also ps she color matched me perfectly and on my skin it does not oxidize. Only did a bit once when i put too much mac primer under. Try it you just may like it.

At 71 I do not have wrinkles but due to my age, most foundations that i could wear years ago i can no longer wear and have it look good and natural looking on my skin. This foundation is virtually flawless on my skin and acts like a second skin without that heavy foundation look. Covers dark spots and gives my skin a nice soft texture & natural look ive never been able to achieve with other brands in this class of makeup. I live in a hit summer climate & this really makes it feel like no makeup on but looking fabulous too.Only thing i do not like is the price."

It goes on light and easy, adds a nice luminous glow to my skin and provides even and light coverage. * Thank goodness ULTA Carrie's this now!! The ONLY foundation that does NOT settle in your fine lines and I have mega lines still doesn't settle, I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION, please chanel never discontinue this! * I love how my skin feels with this Chanel foundation it looks and feels so smooth. I've been using it for five years now. * I've literally tried 5 foundations in the last 2 months all claiming to do the same thing. I have acne scars very large pores deep smile lines that collect the makeup.... And I'm 53. All the nightmares!!!!  This foundation!!!  I mean common!!!  It covered everything!  It blurred the pores on my nose, which nothing ever has, it didn't settle it those deep lines, even the ones in the corner of my mouth!!!  I looked Dewey all day!  I felt like I was wearing nothing. It wasn't even the right shade cause they were out but I just used a bit of bronzer and omg perfection!!  I will never ever use anything else. Yes it's a bit fragrant but that disappears in a few hours no big deal. * It is light with good coverage...looks very natural! * I would like to give 3.5 stars if i could but it isnt an option and i think it deserves more than 3… BUT its nothing spectacular by any means - the CC cream was phenomenal and wheb they discontinued it I was hoping for soemthing that  that lit my skin like that did … this doesnt. Its not even that it doesnt have the coverage (i wasnt looking for that) just that healthy glow fresh face look that Cc cream gave me… i will keep it and use it because it does feel nice, smells like chanel and has spf … but I wont buy it again ever. * After 40, most foundations accentuate every sign of aging, until now. The finish is perfection and lasts all day - no caking, creasing or dry patches. My skin never feels dry, just comfortable. I only wish that there were more cool shades available."
83,smashbox,halo healthy glow tinted moisturizer broad spectrum spf 25,pimprod2016307,2568499," * I sat in ulta and tried on clinique, tula, IT cc cream, and an all natural one i forgot the name. None of them even came close to how perfect halo by smashbox. I literally just put on like sunscreen and it calms and covers my redness. I was worried cause the long chemical list but honestly nothing works as good as it. My skin glows and it blended right into my skin perfectly while hiding my redness. Doesn't look like I'm wearing anything at all. Just a sunscreen that absorbed into my skin and toned down all my redness. amazing product. Highly recommend * The coverage and tone on this product were great! I've had issues with patchy finishes with bb creams in the past, and this one worked so well! Definitely a winner. * I honestly really like smashbox's formulas when it comes to concealers and tinted mousturizer this one has no smell and has great pigment without sticking to fine lines. As a dry skin girlie its hard to find products that dont stick yo my texture so this one is definitely a win. It makes my skin look great and is also a great badd for other products with no pilling or weird texture reactions. I dont use this day to ray anymore but its a great on the go product that evenz skin tone easily and gives a flawless glowy finish * Really loved the coverage and color was a great match, but it made me break out :( I wanted this to work so badly because I thought the finish was beautiful and I loved the spf. Something in it gave me pimples so I won't be using it, but for those without sensitive skin I think it's great. * I couldn't find the right shade, I felt it was pulling at my skin too much-especially for a moisturizer product. Would not recommend * I've been using the Smashbox Halo Healthy Glow All-In-One Tinted Moisturizer, and overall, I'm pleased with its performance. The lightweight formula feels amazing on my skin, and it gives a lovely, natural glow while keeping my skin hydrated throughout the day. The SPF 25 is a great added bonus for daily wear, especially for quick, minimal-effort routines. That said, I do wish it offered just a bit more coverage. While it's perfect for those ""no-makeup makeup"" days, it doesn't quite conceal redness or blemishes as much as I would like. Still, it's a great option for those who prefer a sheer, healthy-looking finish with skincare benefits. *I received this product complimentary for my honest review * * I got it 2 months ago but I totally forgot it till today. Just tried it on. Feel light and matte on skin. The colour Light Medium is quite suitable for my Asian skin tone. I score it 8 out of 10. I definitely buy it again. Always love Smashbox products."

It leaves my skin feeling moisturized without clumping, giving me a youthful glow. The formula is incredibly easy to blend, making it super easy to apply. In a world where everything feels complicated, having a foundation that simplifies my routine is a game changer! * Just hit my 40s and ive used NARS for years. It suddenly started sinking into my forehead lines making them look terrible. Found the recommendation for Polite Society on Tiktok and decided to try it. Its amazing. Its light and doesnt feel cakey at all. Long-lasting as well. Love the fact that its skincare too! Perfect foundation! * This foundation became my new favorite the first time I tried it. I was a loyal Armani Silk foundation girl, but that foundation was just starting to not wear well on me, making me look older and patchier. After a many trails with different foundations, I have 100 percent found my new staple! It wears just as if not MORE beautifully than the Armani silk, and with a lower price point. This foundation HYDRATES my skin, I look dewy in the most BEAUTIFUL way. My skin looks flawless. This is magic in a bottle!! * Love this foundation! It is now a part of my daily makeup routine. Will be buying again! * I wish I would have taken the reviews about the pump breaking to heart. The foundation is nice, but the pump is worth leaving it behind. My pump broken after a few uses, and it just became an unbearable mess to deal with. Due to the nature and shape of the packaging, depoting it into something else is nearly impossible…just a waste of time and money. * I purchased the foundation because the lipstick lesbians gave a great review. The color match for my skin was perfect. I ended up having bumps after using it on my bare skin. My face is still bumpy after a couple days.
I do have sensitive skin * My skin has never been better.
Love the way it feels and its got all day wear. My skin tends eat makeup and separate, not with this one.

I prepped my skin as I normally would, and this product started to separate on my face very quickly. I tried again with zero products on my face, and it still kept separating as soon as I thought I was done blending. Returned :( * Perfect match for my skin. And really light! it looks like my skin. I will continue to purchase. I didn't even know this product existed until a worker at ulta helped me find a new skin tint. If you are looking for a light weight foundation that will match you perfectly things the one for you! * This serum based foundation is so seamless.  It leaves my skin dewy not shiny.   I am 79 my skin is dry.   This foundation blends so well I have more confidence in my natural not so obvious made up look. * This foundation is so light on the skin and has a beautiful natural finish. A little goes a long way so you really get your moneys worth. For lighter coverage and everyday wear I apply it with my fingers then blend with a sponge but when I want a little more coverage for special occasions I'll apply it with a brush. In both cases though I put a few drops in the back of my hand first and work from there. * I liked the product when I first applied it, but after like an hour it kind of turned an orangish hue on my skin.  It was greasy and not at all what I thought this product would be.  Felt heavy on my skin. * For me, it didn't provide enough coverage and the color match was a little off. If you want a lighter coverage, it would be fine because the quality of the foundation seems nice overall… it just wasn't a perfect fit for me."

It's buildable coverage which is convenient. * I love it! * I really wanted to like this, but it just doesn't work for me. I like that it's affordable, has a wide range of shades, and is hydrating. But that's it. The cons for me outweigh the pros. 

No matter how I apply it or how I set it, it always pills in about 4 hours. It's very sheer coverage. It gets greasy as the day goes on. Lastly, it shows texture. I do think this is meany for someone looking for a tinted moisturizer. But, it's not for me no matter how I tried to work with it. * The best foundation I have used in 20 years * I purchased shade Light 03C which is labeled as having pink undertones, but when I applied the foundation it was completely yellow. Very disappointing considering I adore their concealer. * Amazing foundation! A good medium coverage that sinks into the skin, looks flawless, and last all day. Looks better and last longer than most high end foundations I have purchased. Will definitely be repurchasing. * This is a very good foundation. it is not heavy has nice coverage and is hydrating. It does not cake on me blends very easily and looks fantastic. it is  one of my favorites and i have some really expensive foundations in my collection."
88,estÃ©e lauder,double wear sheer long-wear foundation spf 19,pimprod2027234,2586142," * I love the texture of this product. It's very serumy and truly lovely on the skin. I have dry skin and it looks so nice and glowy yet never greasy. It's good for day to day. I love the color too. I have light medium olive skin and the coverage is enough to where it blends just fine. Not a holy grail, but a consistent go-to. * This 👏 product 👏 is 👏 incredible 👏!! It makes my skin look like skin, just perfected!! It does not look like I have makeup on! It evens out my skintone and adds the perfect amount of coverage for every day, especially during hot summer days. I bought this because I was on the hunt for something that would be lighter and not melt off my face in a gross cakey way in the heat, and this is it!! I wish I tried it sooner!! * As a very oily girl, i hate to say but i am disappointed. The doible wear is great for oily skin but i needed something light coverage and matte at the same time. I needed something to wear to work everyday. Unfortunately, my oily skin pertruded after a two hours snd i had to pat down my skin. So i recommend if you have you combo skin but for oily skin not necessarily. * I'm on the fence. Love the finish very natural. Doesn't settle in lines and wrinkles. Very runny and thin seems to take a lot of product to produce a full face coverage.  My 70yo skin on nose is breaking out a bit and this is only new product I am using so I'm just not sure  will keep trying * I really enjoy using this foundation. It is so lightweight, a perfect color match, and wears nicely throughout the day. It doesnt get overly oily/shiny in my T-zone where I experience that the most. Minimal setting into my fine lines and wrinkles - even less when I prep with a primer. 

I highly recommend! * I have dry skin and the regular estee lauder foundation wasnt for me. However, this one worked well. It's lightweight and still covers the small red and dark spots but I would not recommend it to someone looking for a full coverage. * For reference, I have fair warm toned, moderately oily skin. I usually wear 1.05 in Smashbox Studio Skin, and NC15 in MAC Waterweight. I wear 1n2 Ecru in this foundation. I love love this foundation. It is beautiful on, smooth, light coverage. I don't have a lot of dark spots or acne issues. I do have freckles and some redness, but not crazy. This coverage is perfect for me for daily wear. It plays with my other products. I don't get weird grainy break down around my nose, chin, and under my glasses at the bridge of my nose like I do with other foundations. It will last my 16 hour day and still look great, no fading or disappearing act. If you need full coverage, you can skip this one but if you just need an even out with a natural look, this is your girl. I thought Fenty EZ Dropz were the best thing ever until I tried this foundation, and now I won't touch the EZ Dropz again."
89,e.l.f. cosmetics,camo hydrating cc cream spf 30,pimprod2041765,2617546," * Really picky on skin prep. Ive tried a variety of different primers and moisturizers before applying and its always hit or miss. When it works it works but sometimes ir will randomly start pilling halfway through blending. Not a dependable application so a bit disappointing sometimes * I havent decided if im going to keep this. I used the shade finder to pick a shade, but it turned out very orange. I don't think another shade would work for my neutral skin tone and I don't think anyone would ever naturally be this orange for the Light to match them. That said, I am able to use it under my eyes to hide dark circles and then I put a regular foundation on top of it. That works pretty well so I might keep it. I was just hoping to use this as a foundation for my whole face and that won't work unless i want to look like Trump. * Although what I bought is just a little darker than what I needed, I'm mixing it with my lighter foundation and it's perfect. * I suffer from sensitive skin and rosacea. This product was strong enough to cover my redness but gentle enough to not activate my rosacea. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a coverage that is gentle on the skin. * Great coverage and blends well. The price is affordable too. * I'll admit I was not a fan of the original camo CC cream, I feel like no matter shade I got (cool, neutral, warm) they all oxidized orange on me. The hydrating camo CC cream is perfection. I got shade 205N and it is the perfect light neutral for fair skin olive toned girlies. I will absolutely be buying this again. This is my new favorite foundatjon. * I like the product. It is a dupe for the IT one."
90,urban decay cosmetics,hydromaniac tinted moisturizer,pimprod2021082,2567739," * Beautiful look and light weight. It is hydrating and gives a nice dewy look. Unfortunately when i try to use a damp sponge (product instructions say you can use a sponge) it completely removes the product. Maybe its just me but it only works if i use a brush which im not a fan of.  Also noticed if i sweat and try to dab it, the make up comes off completely as well. And this happens even if i use powder which works fine with other foundations. * this the best foundation the that feels like I'm not wearing layers of foundation. In fact I hate when I feel foundation that super heavy and can tell that you're wearing layers of foundation. The only down fall is if your oily you do need to use blotting sheets to absorb the foundation. * This is by far my favorite foundation! * I needed to find a foundation that wouldn't cling as much to whatever eczema I have and won't melt off my face. This one so far is doing great and it does not oxidize on me, which is great as well. * This foundation gives very nice coverage and hydration without smudging or transfer. I've tried the CC+ and Bye Bye foundation by IT Cosmetics, but neither delivered as well as this. * Love how light the formula is but it gives good coverage.  For someone who is older this is a great alternative to traditional face make up. * Im someone who struggles with dry skin and babbyyyyy this foundation is soooo good for that! It doesnt cake up where i have dry patches and will lasg all day! I cant say enough good things about this product!"
91,estee lauder,futurist hydra rescue moisturizing foundation spf 45,pimprod2013152,2577966," * If you are on the fence - READ THIS: I am a hardcore makeup enthusiast and ive tried all kinds of foundations across the spectrum. I was hooked on the Loreal Infalliable foundation for years because its long lasting and I need medium to full coverage that lasts 12+ hours. However, my aging skin needed a better foundation that incorporates skin care and more sunscreen. For reference, I am in my late 30s, I have extremely dry skin, but I get oily in my T zone. I have to layer on products under my makeup to keep me hydrated and so I don't look like a flaky mess - and I am starting to get crows feet and other fine lines. I went to the Ulta store and this caught my eye, and I'm so glad it did. This product has absolutely changed my life and my confidence levels. I would definitely recommend going to the store to find your shade match because there are tons of shades, and they all have very different undertones, but I was able to find my perfect match for the first time in my life. It feels like skin care with medium buildable coverage and gives you the most flawless, beautiful skin like finish. I literally gasped when I put it on. It also works well with other cosmetic brands for concealer, powder, etc. I use Tarte's Creaseless concealer, Maybelline poreless powder, and MMMade by Mitchell bronzer and my skin looks absolutely FLAWLESS even with NO primer. Please never discontinue this item!!!! Estee Lauder absolutely crushed it with this product!! Any negative reviews on here I would chalk up to poor skin care prior to application because this stuff really feels like second skin. DON'T HESITATE BUY IT!!!!!!! :) * My favorite foundation . Love the formula for my skin . Doesnt leave my skin oily like NARS or other liquid foundations do . Has good hydration and lasts all day * This product has a strong fragrance. It did not blend well, and had a very dry pasty effect. I'm a less is more type girl, so maybe it would work for someone who does a bit more layering of products? I would say primer is a must under this product. It literally reminds me of liquid face paint. * I typically wear Lancome Skin Feels Good but wanted something with more coverage and more dewy finish, which this has on both counts. It feels nice on dry winter skin, looks decent for most of my work day. The colors are a litle darker than they appear in the example photos. I purchased Ecru 1n2, and it would really be more appropriate for a summer shade for me. The photos just made the lighter colors look basically white. However, I found the corresponding concealer in this line to be too light!!! I would have gotten a better match in person, but most of my local Ultas dont carry EL in store. * First off, I'm 42, a skincare enthusiast, and my dry/combo skin requires a moisturizing foundation. I've tried most high end foundations, and the EL Futurist Hydra foundation is it, folks. I'm on my fourth tube, and I'll keep buying it along with the Futurist primer. Not only is this foundation non drying, long lasting & great at covering redness -- the added SPF 45 is a total bonus. The high SPF is what made me purchase initially. Granted, I apply an SPF before my makeup routine, but hey, the more the merrier. Highly recommend. * I purchased this foundation about five years ago, back when there was only a few shades. I guess they were testing the market at the time. I ended up with the lightest shade (Porcelain C0). I used it until the tube expired, and now I bought my normal shade from EL which is 1C1 Cool Bone. I'm so happy they offer this shade now! Truthfully, both shades suit me fine. I have pale skin with a pink undertone. I am 40 years old and have combo skin that leans dry in the winter and more oily in the summer. I love this foundation in the winter months to keep my skin plump and hydrated! It goes on like butter with a high medium coverage. I tried this in the summer, and it didn't last very long. It's totally fine since I switch up foundations between colder and warmer months.  This is an awesome foundation if you have dry skin! * Moisturizing, silky smooth to apply, and the color is just right."

93,chanel,nÂ°1 de chanel revitalizing foundation,pimprod2029950,2605425," * This is a nice foundation but I don't find this foundation particularly luminous. To me it's almost a soft matte. I have to add oil to it to achieve any luminosity. coverage is a solid medium and I would consider it buildable. I don't find it great for dry mature skin.  It can look a little cakey if not applied in thin layers. I will finish it but won't repurchase. For my skin type I much prefer the Healthy Glow foundation as an all purpose foundation. This foundation is more full glam for me. * This is my new favorite foundation. I can apply it with my hands, brush, sponge and it always looks so beautiful and natural. The color match is perfect and it lasts throughout my entire 8 hour work day and beyond. I cannot recommend this enough. I also do have oily/combo skin. * The price of this foundation is ridiculous, but I keep buying it because for my skin it is the best foundation out there. I just love it. I apply with a sponge and it looks beautiful all day long. * The foundation has great coverage with a very light feeling. * I don't wear makeup often but this foundation is the best that I have seen on me.  I receive compliments every time I wear it.  I have BR42 and it makes my face look bright - I love the color. * I've really tried to like this makeup but after continually trying it still burns and by the afternoon my face has flaky peeling patches. * The only time I get compliments on my skin is when I'm wearing this. It's expensive but lasts a long time and a little goes a long way. Its the perfect weight for me—light to medium coverage."
94,smashbox,always on skin-balancing foundation with hyaluronic acid + adaptogens,pimprod2040206,2610447," * I tried this foundation because the Smashbox 24 hr Hydra foundation was gold. However, this foundation is too matte, does not stay in place, does not cover well, and looks very unnatural. * It goes on great but than an hour later it's muted, gray and dull. Its also making my skin very dry and causing break outs. They need to bring studio skin back. * I havd tried pretty much every foundation out there from drugstore to high end and thus is in my top three favorites. It just looks so beautiful on the skin, covers what you need covered, and is lightweight and looks like skin. I love this foundation and i hope they never get rid of it. * This foundation is ok. I just don't like that I have use a setting powder in certain areas on my face because it settles in my fine lines. But my biggest issue is that I've bought this foundation 3 times now at Ulta and every single time the shade is different. It's like 1 to 2 shades lighter so now every time I go, I have to bring an old one that matches me to make sure I get one that's the correct shade. * I dont know what they did with the original formula they had…but this one is not good. I used smashbox for years then switched to NARS.. didnt buy smashbox foundation for a while until recently and this new formula is just so bad!!! Like WHY SMASHBOX?! Why did you guys ruin my fav ever foundation! It exaggerates my pores so bad that im embarrassed to be seen wearing it.. after the first time i thoufht i could just ignore it but after the 3rd time wearing it i cant. Im putting it away and will be Sticking to my Nars foundation from now on! * I've been a loyal Smashbox fan for years. Their Studio Skin has been my HG, but of course they've had to discontinue it. Hearing about this new line- I gave it a shot but it's a no-go. Disappointing is an understatement. If you're a pale girly, with neutral undertone, and have any skin issues- you're out of luck. Now I have to find a completely new brand and everything.

I wore .3 in studio skin and asked help from a smashbox rep, they recommended f20c. Omg what an absolute joke. Extremely dark and orange on my skin. I got a few other shades to try out (because of course online only)- and the closest one is F10N- but it's too pale and yellow for me. 

Besides that- the formula isn't great. It has no staying power, ie, it will start to run/smudge immediately if you get any moisture on your skin and it does not apply well at all. I agree with the strangely chalky appearance others have commented- which highlights any/every imperfection. I'm early 30s and combo/dry rosacea prone skin and its a no go for me.

When you find a great trustworthy foundation, it feels priceless. This one is a total miss. Smashbox- bring back the studio skin! You had a customer for life. * I was very excited to try this but it was a major letdown. 

I have sensitive combination skin that has been on the dry side lately due to retinol. I explained this to the Ulta employee and she recommended this foundation for me. 

I put it on today and it makes my face look like chalk. I moisturize and prep appropriately, but no matter. It looks dry, flat, and has poor coverage. 

Definitely returning."
95,maybelline,super stay 24h skin tint + vitamin c,pimprod2039657,2610817," * As an oily girl, I have hard time keeping my makeup in place for at least 2 hours.  This foundation so far keeps my face from getting too oily and greasy at least for 6 hours.  Just wonderful! * This is my favorite, it blurs my pores & gives my skin a healthy look. I get compliments all the time w/ this. I was raving till 7 am, this stayed put!! * I have been struggling to find a moisturizing foundation for my dry skin in the winter months. I have tried several different drug store and high-end brands and nothing compares to Maybelline's Super Stay 24hr Skin Tint. It is light weight and gives me the coverage I need for my uneven skin tone. It does not cake or crease in my fine lines. I will never go back to another foundation after using this!!! * It's not as light of a tint as I would've hoped, but it is very light on the skin, I actually really like it for everyday wear. * I love using this for everyday wear. It holds up nicely and does well with oily/combo skin. * I absolutely love this skin tint. Its so bulidable if i want to go lighter or heavier i can. Its like my skin but better. It does help fight the sweat on the humid days when paired with a good primer. Highly recommend. * This Maybelline Skin Tint is beautiful on the skin and it does last.  I really like it!  It is difficult to find my exact shade.  At this point, I have purchased three shades before I found one that really matches.  I wish there was a way to have small samples we could try prior to purchase.  However, the effort was worth it!!"
96,l'orÃ©al,true match super-blendable foundation,pimprod2034733,2602421," * I initially liked this foundation but found that it looked caulky abd patchy on my skin, particularly around fine lines and drier parts of my face. Its a pass for me and I threw out the remaining priduct. * I wear tinted sunscreen but felt I needed something more when I wear a full face of makeup. This has great coverage, not tacky, good color match and long wearing. Great price point since I don't wear it every day. * I think it just depends in what typ on skin you have. * This is my nee favkrite foundation. I stopped wearing makeup because foundation always felt too heavy and settled on my face. This did not. Makeup looked great all night. * Color matches beautifully to whats shown online, lightweight. Light coverage but also buildable. I use one pump amd than do a powder foundation by maybelline and lasts all day. This may not cover acne prone skin, but it definitely helped a little with redness on my cheeks. A good product all around, it doesnt feel heavy. * I love this foundation and have used it for years! The shade I use matches me perfectly and the liquid is very blendable and feels light on my skin. I only have one complaint and its about the pump. I miss the old screw-on caps! The pump wastes so much product because you can't really control how much is coming out and can't get all of the liquid out especially if you're getting close to the bottom and shake it up. With the old screw-on cap, you had control of how much you want to get out and you could get all of the product out. The only downfall of that was possibly dropping the bottom, but I waste so much product and have to buy more often which is just messed up L'Oreal. I love this product though and will stick with it so long as the formula and color stay the same. * It is a very much affordable foundation and feels smooth on the skin. I like it very much because it blends almost perfectly on my skin"
97,estÃ©e lauder,double wear stay in place matte powder foundation refill,pimprod2031253,2593713," * Love products * I wear 1c1 in winter but 2c1 in summer,I love how easy it is to change out shades with these refills. It's a wonderful, flexible formula that's never cakey. * I buy ivorynude (one if the lightest shades).The color mathecs perfects, at first. However, with a couple hours, my makeup looks a couple shades darker. I have worn this on my tropical vacations and it holds against water, still looking perfect. If you buy a couple shades lighter, it may work for you. * Love the smooth look 👌 * I am 47 with normal to dry skin. Full coverage long lasting! * Reason for 3 star, I didn't like the color on me * I really love this foundation - it goes on smooth and feels weightless. However, I don't believe that the color is true to the liquid foundation. Initially, yes, but it seems to oxidize within 30-60 minutes, making you look a slightly different shade/darker. I wear a combination of 2N1 and 2N2. The 2N1 powder went on great but now my skin looks  very pink compared to my neck. I never have this issue with the liquid version."
98,dior,forever natural nude foundation,pimprod2036826,2604394," * This foundation is amazing..it's as if the Forever Matte and Glow had a baby.  It gives such a beautiful satin finish that is not too matte and not too glowy just perfect. I will definitely buy this again and I've recommended it to quite a few of my friends and they love it as well! * I have been trying to decide why I am not reaching for this foundation and I have come to the conclusion I may have gotten an old bottle. The texture is thick and gel like; not what I would expect from a ""nude natural"" foundation. Looks cakey. and when I shake it I don't hear or feel any movement in the bottle. It doesn't really smell spoiled although it does have a fragrance as Dior does. I have tried thinning it out with oil or moisturizer but then it doesn't dry down as it should. I am disappointed but don't know if it's actually the product or that I received  an old bottle. Unfortunately I tossed the box. It's not impossible as I have received  expired products from the warehouse on a couple of other occasions. But I have definitely had better foundations that cost less. * I was not wowed by this foundation. maybe my color match wasn't the best. I am fair to light with a neutral leaning slightly warm complexion and I don't think there is a great match for me in this product. I did not find this product to look very natural or give me any sort of radiance. I felt it looked semi matte rather than a natural finish. Coverage was fine-light to medium as expected. I much prefer Chanel's Healthy Glow foundation. I have mature skin and think perhaps this foundation is better suited to a younger customer. I didn't dislike it but I would not repurchase it. For me it looked rather flat no matter how I prepped my skin. * This is a fantastic foundation! It's lightweight and  leaves me looking naturally flawless. I will say it doesn't completely cover dark spots/acne but I am personally fine with that- nothing a little concealer can't help with. I will definitely be repurchasing. * Wonderful product! * This is the best foundation that I have tried in at least the last 5 years of searching for ""the one"".  Not too heavy or too light. Not cakey and does not settle into my fine lines. This foundation lasts throughout the workday and well into the evening. Definitely worth the price. Finally!  I've found the one!! * Here's a quick review you can use for Dior foundation at Ulta:

""I absolutely love how smooth the Dior foundation applies to my skin! It blends effortlessly, giving me a flawless finish that feels lightweight yet provides great coverage. The formula feels luxurious, and it lasts all day without creasing or feeling heavy. Whether you're going for a natural look or building it up for full glam, this foundation is a game-changer. Highly recommend trying it out—you won't be disappointed!"""
99,mac,studio radiance serum powered foundation,pimprod2040797,2613967," * Not as great as I thought this would be.  This foundation has a great finish, but still settles in fine lines.  Perhaps I need to experiment more with different primers.  I am on the fence about returning for my Double Wear from EL. * I'm extremely disappointed with your new Mac Foundation, as a long time wearer of NW10 the formula has TOTALLY changed! The new NW10 has an orange tone to it, it's darker, and way too shiny. It actually makes my face an orangy in a not healthy way. This foundation is also way too shiny, and rubs off easily while trying on clothes etc. Not a fan at all I'm switching to Nars. Very disappointed; I have been a Mac fan for SO Long. If you are fair skinned be warned that the formula has changed, maybe if you have never used this you'll be happy, but as a long time user of this I've moved on. Would not repurchase and wish I could get my money back. * NC5 - Non-irritating, comfortable. Clings to dry patches and looks powdery and flakey, more than other brands. I exfoliate, moisturize, but don't use primers. I apply with my fingers, so maybe it would look better with more prep or darker shades. * The finish of this foundation is beautiful and people consistently comment on how gorfeous my slin is wheb wearing it. I apply eith a buffing brush and over the winter Ive added sn extra drop of hyaluronic acid (already an ingredient so it blends right in). My skin looks radiant, and thats a difficult accomplishment at 57.  

Issues to watch out for: this foundation has no sunscreen, apply a good protective sunscreen prior to the foundatipn. The undertones are labled in what many would consider backwards. ""C"" does not mean cool, from their description it's a warm tome. Same for ""W"", which is describedss a cool tone. Keep in mind when looking for a shade. * Daughter used for her latest dance competition and it held up all day beer the lights with minimal touch ups * It is so hard to find a foundation that works with dry skin and works well with very hydrating under makeup skin prep but this is one if the best foundations I have gound for dry skin. Doesnt cling to dry patches. Covers evenly. Very easy to apply and a little goes a long way! * This product is too thick and heavy. I did not like it at all."
100,maybelline,super stay up to 24hr hybrid powder-foundation,pimprod2036593,2603936," * This was my go to daily wear foundation. Great colors and nice light coverage. However, almost immediately cracks form in the pan and big chunks fall out of the compact and the little dust particles that are left are pretty much rendered useless. It's unfortunate because the product could be very good. * First off, Shade 112 is absolute perfection for me. This has such incredible coverage that only a small amount is required to help make your skin look so pretty! It can be built up to absolute full coverage but, in my opinion, that can look a bit cakey and too artificial. I use a flat top brush to apply this mostly to my nose and cheeks where I've got the most redness then pull it outward and I'm never not satisfied with the coverage. I've gotten a darker shade to wear as bronzer just because it covers so well! * Nice texture and goes on easy. Wish I had bought a slightly darker shade. * This powder foundation is quick and easy to apply. The only issue I have with it is that it tends to cake up under the eye area if you have wrinkles there. Otherwise it's perfect for smooth and young skin. * This is awesome alone or applied with big brush over Maybelline 30hr Super Stay foundation! * Looks very dry and cakes. will only use very lightly. I have dry skin and this looks very dry and cakey. * Ive used this product for years. This new formula is super loose messy red tones & transfers . Sad I have to find another powder."

Leaves skin feeling soft like your not wearing anything at all. I also love the tarte Amazonian clay foundation this is the same except in powder form. I definitely recommend and i will definitely buy again. I was hesitant at first because of mu fine lines but this soft powder excels at blurring and leaving a beautiful soft matte look.

I get full coverage without the dryness and cracking that other products caused. This product produces a flawless look. * This foundation has many positive attributes. It has a lovely natural finish and a great shade range. It feels like a serum and blends beautifully. I so wanted to love this because the shade was perfect which is unusual for me. Unfortunately, it felt terrible on my face. Granted, I have dry, mature skin but I'm not particularly sensitive. I could not get past the tight feeling from the alcohol in this. It made my skin sting, feel tight and look dry as the day wore on. I felt it wore very well but it also caused some redness for me. I tried several moisturizers, oils and primers and nothing helped. so it's definitely a NO for me. It felt like a strange polymer on my face. However, for anyone not sensitive to a high alcohol content I would still recommend it. It truly is a beautiful foundation and if it was reformulated without so much alcohol I would try it again. * Goes on like a serum, covers like a light weight powder. I received so many compliments.

This foundation does provide full coverage which was exciting to me, but the longer I wore it, the worst it looked. I could almost tell after a few minutes of having it on, it was alresdy breaking down on my skin. Very disappointed.

105,wyn beauty,featuring you hydrating skin enhancing tint spf 30,pimprod2044322,2622290," * I really like this fundation , good for dry skin * I had such high hopes for this product! I was looking for a hydrating skin tint with an SPF of 30 minimum and this one matched all of my criteria at a great price point. The first time I used it, it didn't blend very well but I figured maybe I just wasn't used to this product and that it would get better with time. The second time I noticed the coverage was very patchy and it was even dry at parts - weird because I really don't have dry skin. After noticing the color I ordered online just wasn't matching I went to Ulta to get a color match, which I was pretty optimistic about because there's such a huge shade range. While we couldn't find a shade that perfectly matched me (it was either too dark or too light), we did notice that this product was just giving me a lot of texture on my face. I ended up returning this all together and getting another brand. * I love this skin tint so much on my oily skin. One of the best shades I've ever had. * Thank u thank u! Not heavy. I love this so much! * I love this product! It's very light but gives great coverage and gives a tiny glow to the skin. On to my 3rd bottle. * It has buildable coverage, doesn't dry out my skin, and has SPF. Love it so much, Serena Williams ate with this!!! * Quality ingredients, long lasting, feels great and breathable, makes my skin look AMAZING, has spf, and it's literally what I've been looking for forever! It's buildable and can rise to any occasion - casual/light on the go looks, athletic, and full glam. I'm officially a Wyn Girl for life! Thank you Serena for this huge score!"
106,hourglass,ambient soft glow foundation,pimprod2033509,2599657," * I love this foundation! It lasts all day and has buildable coverage if you use a sponge to apply. It gives a blurred and glowy appearance to my acne prone skin. I find it also works very well in humid and hot climates (just don't overapply). I was surprised by some of the negative reviews. * I really wanted to like this. I have oily skin, im 38… i do have larger pores and some texture. i always do really good skin prep before makeup. Ive given this several tries with different techniques and every time the same things happen: 
1) it looks absolutely beautiful upon the initial application, within about an hour it settles into EVERY. SINGLE. PORE. It looks like i applied it specifically to enhance them.
2) i dont know how this is even possible but if you have ANY peach fuzz on your face at all this foundation clings to them and makes it stand out so eveeyone can see it. I dermaplane regularly and ive never had makeup do this before. 
3) after about 3 hours of wear time, it has separated and become patchy, and it cannot be fixed with touch up powder.  It also looks dry and chalky but oily at the same time… not sure how this happens. 
4) if you touch this with your phone, your hands, literally anything it moves around your face or just comes off. 

Im not saying its bad quality i think it just isnt working for me and my skin. Ill be returnjng and going back to lancome matte long wear. * I like that it covers up my redness (usually I have to color correct with green) but no matter what primer and moisturizer I use it looks really cakey. * Not for oily/combination skin. I was not impressed with this foundation. * Ambient Softglow foundation in color 4.5
Over 40 skin, fairy good buildable coverage, stayed on most of the day with or without primer. Caused T Zone to be very oily however. Did not have a glow, more like a high gloss shine to my face. * This foundation was a major let down, especially for the price. It's absolutely NOT dry/combo skin friendly, even with a primer and setting spray. Looked very patchy and didn't last at all. Not dewy or airbrush in my experience, definitely a matte look (dry). Even tried with a moisturizer and primer. Used their brushes with it and it honestly looked even worse than with a sponge. The only upside was the shade range, the color was a perfect match for my cool toned skin, which is hard to find. * I actually like this foundation better than the lancome. It does feel hydraying bit after anout 5 hours, does feel oily."

My daughter found this for me and so far i absolutely love it. The color match is perfect.  It goes on so soft and smooth and there is not a weird or strong smell. * Good coverage. * The first time gave me a rash so I waited a couple of months to make sure it was this and I tried it again and gave a red bumps all over my face. I'm not the only one. There's a lot of bad reviews w the same effect. * Excellent powder foundation for older women.  I don't know why my color doesn't seem to be available anymore though.  What's going on with the limited shade offerings?  Fenty still has all 50 shades on their website! * Ive been using this powder in shade 150 since it came out. All of a sudden theres no lighter shades? Not even one around the color ive been using. I've probably went through 10 of these compacts, and am beyond disappointed. Def gives me the ick for the brand!! * Perfect match for my skin tone. * I did the color match online and they matched me with a Shane that is not even available anymore. At the store I matched with 210 and the consultant said they are not going to carry that shade anymore. why would this supposedly inclusive brand cut all these different shades from their lineup? Now I guess I have to find another brand to buy powder from."
109,covergirl,simply ageless skin perfector essence foundation,pimprod2042952,2618803," * This is my favorite ""skin-tint"" esque product I have tried thus far. It's extremely light weight, blends in quite easily, doesn't look weird over textured skin, lasts a good amount of time, and has a natural finish without looking too glowy. I would rate this a 4.5 if I could though, because I really dislike the packaging. The wrapper is really hard to remove and makes you peel of the label in order to be able to access the product, and the bottom of the product is bulbous, so it can barely stand up straight. It's not enough to make me stop using the product though, the formula really is incredible, I just would love the packaging to be updated a bit as it seems extremely cheap, even for a drugstore brand. * This product is perfect for those who are minimalists with their make up routine and want minimal coverage. It looks so nautral and evens out my skin tone while covering flaws. I really do love! * FINALLY…. A product that is super thin, lightweight, light coverage, AND works for my combo/oily skin! I will buy this forever! * I really didn't know how this would look on me, I usually use more silicone based foundation so... But this one was very nice. I did have to put it on the back of my hand and give a little mix first then apply it to my face. I tried pumping it directly on my skin and it didn't blend right.. This foundation is definitely not beginner friendly.  I'm sure everyone is different but this is the best method for me. Also I have dry, mature, skin. It wore nicely for about 4 hours. After that I needed a touch up. But it's definitely a nice light coverage!! * This stuff is the definition of ""your skin but better."" I've tried SO many tinted serums, wasted so much money on $40+ brands for them to be useless. I've found the easiest way to apply this is directly to your face, then blend with fingers, then blend out with a beauty blender. 

I have sensitive skin and rosacea, this is the first product I've ever used that didn't irritate or break out my skin. And weirdly, despite having pretty light coverage, this does an amazing job at covering my redness. Covering actually might not be the right word, it's more like toning almost. It doesn't look like I have anything on, yet still seems to almost eliminate my redness (which has always been severe). I have no clue how this works, I swear it's magic because  I cannot understand it. 

Coverage is somewhat buildable, but definitely meant to be used lightly. It'll get cakey if you set it with powder, and then if it gets wet it'll lift really weird, but I don't ever feel the need to use powder. Powder blush and brozer work fine over it, just not setting your whole face. I'll go all day just with this and not get oily at all, it doesn't slide off like other tinted serums, and when it does wear it looks really natural. A bit sticky at first but it will dry down, and feels like there's nothing on your face! Definitely is somewhat waterproof, by far the most oit of any other product like this I've tried. 

I've worn this to bed many times without any breakouts, and in the morning I truly can't tell whether there's any of it left on my face (in a good way), because my skin looks better after wearing this. Probably the bakuchiol, which is what prompted me to buy it bc I already use a serum with that every night that I love. 

And again, I don't have great skin to begin with, and I've gotten endless compliments on my skin since I started using this. People saying my rosacea looks better, pores, texture, etc. 

I don't bother with reviews much, but man, every time I use this stuff, every time I look in the mirror I can't stop thinking how good my skin looks, and how natural. * The first few times I used this I thought it looked beautiful on the skin when first applied. But noticed after being on my skin for a little bit my skin felt tight. I should have looked at the ingredients first. Benzyl Alcohol is pretty high on the list of ingredients. unfortunately, it makes my already dry skin drier. * I've used this a few times and have been loving it on my no makeup makeup days when I don't want a full coverage base. I get hormonal acne along my chin so it tends to leave acne scars, so this doesn't fully cover them up but it still gives a natural finish. 

It leaves my skin looking healthy, covers my spider veins, provides light coverage under my eyes in place of concealer, and gives me an all around healthy glow. 

I do 2 pumps and rub it between my hands first then spread evenly onto my face before using a brush to buff it out. I recommend this if you're starting out with makeup or if you prefer a natural finish."
110,colourpop,pretty fresh hyaluronic hydrating foundation,pimprod2016944,2566879," * I use a brush for my foundation and this product spreads easily, and is nicely pigmented. * To start, I'm 41 with dry skin and rosacea and I've had the hardest time trying to find a foundation that covered my redness and also didnt dry my skin out and flake off. This foundation has been awesome! Great coverage, doesn't dry out my skin and covers all my rosacea redness!! * it matched my skin tone perfectly, but made my skin crack, But it was good overall probably won't buy again 4 stars * Great foundation, especially for the price! Bought the primer as well which works very well in preparation for the foundation. Went back and bought mascara to try. It is also a wonderful product. * One wintery day I wandered into Ulta and asked for a natural finish foundation recommendation. I had never heard of this before but was willing to give it a shot, especially with the great price point. I've been wearing it for almost a year now and it's my go-to. The color stays true throughout the day and has a very natural finish. It's also very buildable depending on the coverage you prefer. I've had lots of comments about my ""beautiful, glowing skin"", never had that happen before, lol!! But seriously, I have struggled for years with acne and this covers it well and does not add to the problem. * This foundation is so cakey. Even using a hydrating primer and setting spray, the finish is super thick and ashy. * I LOVE this foundation and i use it daily for work. I feel like it looks good even when my skin isnt clear and thats a big deal. When i want something heavier I will use the Ulta Beauty Foundation but Pretty Fresh is my go to! Please never discontinue!"
111,l'orÃ©al,age perfect radiant serum foundation,pimprod2017262,2569315," * This settled into my lines and made me look older.  It went on so well and 6 hours later was very patchy, worn off in several places even though I used a primer.  I am very disappointed. * Used this for years. Its an amazing foundation. No cons. It is lightweight comfortable easy to use and has sunscreen in it! Plus! * I had such high hope for this product since I've seen a good amount of people loving it but when I tried it, it separated. Even when I used a blurring primer it still sunk into my pores to the point where it looked like I had dots all over my face. I say try it to see if it works for you but this was my experience with it. If you don't like a strong sunscreen smell, this product has just that. * Goes on smoothly. Good coverage. * I have no idea why this product is online only in my area! It' should be in every store. Fantastic for maturing skin. Doesn't accentuate fine lines or settle in creases. * i absolutely love the finish of this product and the way it feels. it is buildable and so so comfortable to wear. it makes me hesitant to try another foundation bc this formula really hits all the marks for me! 
i personally prefer a dewy and natural look, and something that evens out my skin tone. i find that other makeup sits well on top of it, the only time ive seen it move around because of another product is when i tried to put the saie illuminator on top. if your preferences are like mine i think you will like this product !! * I don't know why this isn't sold in stores! It's absolutely fantastic! I don't normally like wearing liquid foundation because it feels heavy but this one is so light and actually does provide good coverage without the heaviness. I have plenty of acne scars and discoloration and it makes my skin appear almost flawless - basically solid coverage without feeling like full coverage heavy foundation. I don't even need to wear concealer under my eyes or elsewhere when I use this. I like to apply it by squeezing a few lines onto each area of my face directly from the tube and then work it in with a brush. I go back in with a dab of liquid bronzer to give my face dimension. If I have time I'll let it dry 5-10 min and set very lightly by pushing in some setting powder. It ends up with a nice dewy finish but if you go heavier on the setting powder you can get closer to matte if that's what you like. Lastly, I wear the ivory shade which works in combination with the bronzer but would otherwise be too pale (I'm a 2N1 in Estee Lauder powder in winter and 2N2 in summer). I just ordered the golden ivory in this product for summer but again, with bronzer the ivory still works for me all year."

I pair it with the Sweetener Concealer and the pairing is beautiful! * i could go on and on about how much i love r.e.m. beauty, but for now, let's stick to the one and only sweetener foundation! i truly have never worn a foundation that felt this weightless on my skin. it literally feels like i have nothing on my face, all the while being great, buildable coverage. i have combination skin that tends to only get oily on my t-zone, but i don't have any issues with it separating the foundation. i truly recommend this! * I saw a lot of hype about this foundation. I wanted to love it, but it wasn't for me. I have 37 year old combination skin with hormonal breakouts on occasion. I prepped my face completely before using this. It did not look great from the start but worsened as the night went on. I could see my redness through the makeup, it separated in my face, and it felt very drying on my skin. I returned it the next day. Now, three days later, I'm breaking out all over my face. I have to assume it's from this foundation. I cannot recommend this. It was horrible for me. * It pilled and dried down too quickly, was not easy to work with. Too patchy. With the right skin type, the coverage could be very good. * I love this foundation, but had to learn how to use it. The first time I applied it with a fluffy foundation brush and it was somehow both cakey and patchy. I decided to give it another try with a damp beauty blender and it was beautiful. After learning how to use it, I noticed that it has a beautiful matte finish while still looking natural. I would also say that it is more of a medium/full coverage. It also has a fanastic shade range and the shade I got matched my skin perfectly. * This foundation is amazing! Smooth, easy to apply, feels like my own skin! Perfect!"

It made my skin look pasty and oily like I was sick.  I tried mixing it with other foundations, because I really wanted to love it. It's Chanel! Still, it just ruined everything I tried it with. I tried it as a highlight, and it was ok for that, but not good. I put it in my purse as an emergency foundation, but in the GA heat, the beads melted together. Overall, it was just a mess for me. I really regret this purchase. * Yes, it's pricy but it's doing the job of 3 different products: eye primer, concealer, and foundation. It's also very easy to take when traveling. 

How to use it as a concealer: use your finger and tab it under your eye
How to use it as a foundation: use the small brush that comes with it and contour it on your face. Then use a foundation brush or beauty blender to ""blend it out"" (don't just use a regular foundation brush - it might be too much)
How to use it as a eye primer: use the small brush that comes it it and apply it on your eyelid before applying eyeshadow. 

Another trick: while this is a natural finish, you can add a subtle glow by applying Chanel liquid highlighter underneath (as a primer). * I really like Chanel's original Water Fresh product, but it's too bulky to travel with. This version has way better packaging and has more coverage so it's particularly good for work and event travel. But, oddly, it looks and feels drying on my (normal, slightly sensitive) skin. It highlights tiny fine lines I didn't know I had. The formula is not significantly different than the original, it just has more pigment, and the whole schtick is hyalauronic acid and hydration, so I don't know why it has this effect. It's noticeable, so I have to beef up my skincare accordingly in order to wear it and apply it while my moisturizer/SPF are still tacky. May not be suitable for folks with dry or textured skin, or folks who find these issues too fussy."

This summer I developed some really bad sunspots and no matter how much corrector/concealer I'd use, my skin would look grey where the sun spots were.  One day, I tried this because I had gotten a sample and omg it has saved me!  I finally felt comfortable going out again without thinking everyone was staring at me.  The weird part was, it wasn't as heavy or full coverage as my concealer but worked 100x better.  Well, I'm finally at the end of that little tube and also, I now need a lighter color, so here I am.  

This CC cream is better than any other I've tried, it somehow has great coverage but looks incredibly soft and natural.  I'm also able to use it where I need it without seeing lines of demarcation.  This is most definitely an unsung hero and I'm baffled as to how it doesn't have a better rating. * I came in today looking for the tarte BB cream, but saw the cloud CC cream and went with it instead.

Not my favorite foundation, but its great for every day or summertime. * This product was a little too much coverage for me and settled into fine lines. I returned and bought the Tarte tinted moisturizer. I'm happy with that. * This is a nice light-feeling foundation. This also has the shade that's the closest match to my own skin tone. Only need a little bit, one pump and get a nice medium coverage for redness, etc. * I love this as a foundation. I use a very small amount because it does tend to oxidize a bit if you build too much product in my experience. Great natural look. * I love the light as air feeling and medium coverage, but it clogged my pores. I will use this up on my undereyes only. Also, wish the travel size bottles came in more shades."

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NEVER EVER discontinue or reformulate. I am a customer for life and this foundation has changed my life. * very skin like finish! no fuss foundation. * This is an undetectable foundation on my mature, dry skin, though it can build easily for extra coverage. I will just add additional drops on those darker spots, which still peek through but look more homogenous. But coverage is not my main concern, so this winner maintains the slightly dewy glow over a well -prepped skin base, still looking un made-up by the end of the day. Also, goes over mineral sunscreen flawlessly. IMO it is on par with Haus Labs, Nars Radiant LIght, MUF reboot; my other favs. I am trying another shade, though am happy with Katey, the match I found via the skin models- so that's my recommendation for finding your shade, rather than the description. It is on sale, so... TRY IT! * I'm assuming this foundation is on clearance because of quality issues… I received my order and the formula is completely separated and cannot be mixed back together to a good consistency. * I was so surprised when i first used it, my skin looked like skin. I like a lightweight natiral finish and this gives me exactly that! It also stays on all day/night, only thing is that it oxidizes a little bit but not wnything drastic. Has been my go-to foundation for over a year already! * good match for hard shade (fair/light olive) and good for sensitive/acne prone/scar/texture skin. decent coverage but feels light and natural. but doesnt really set (makeup smudges on my cat) & taking the top off pulls the entire pump out sometimes * I have used this foundation for a few years and it's never let me down. I fluctuate between a range of their lighter, cool toned shades depending on the time of year. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. A few things I've learned along the way: 

*A thin base layer will cover most spots and uneven tones. If you need more coverage, then spot treat with a little more foundation.
*It pairs beautifully on top of Nudestix tinted sunscreen.
*Applies well with brushes or sponges, but better with your fingers.
*A stippling, dabbing motion is the best method to apply the thin layers.

I'm 41, and I receive many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation, and I feel like I look more youthful with this on. I will definitely continue to repurchase!"

I always use translucent powder on top though, so I'm not sure if that's the reason. It lasts really well too. It's very hydrating and genuinely does feel weightless enough to sleep in.

Regarding the controversy around this brand and lack of shade range, I don't think it deserves any more hate than every other foundation brand from the last 50 years that only catered to white people. They tried to be more inclusive based on feedback and it was a flop, but then they tried again and they deserve credit for that. They're a small company so they probably focused on the majority of the market first (in America, that's still light and medium skin tones). They probably had more shades in development and might've released them too early. Review bombing a startup is immature and lacks perspective and consideration. * I could not find a shade in this product and I am a medium skin tone. There has also been controversies about the darkest shades being pure black but that is besides the point, this foundation works horribly on skin with texture and that is oily, it peels, lifts, and just does not look good on bumps or acne. Might I add this formula is very overpriced for what it is. * Sucks * I have very sensitive skin and this is one of the very, very, very few foundations that I can use without irritation.  The coverage level is a little higher than I prefer, so I usually mix it with a little moisturizer before applying it. * (Really bad) controversy aside, for the price the foundation doesn't perform well. I prep my skin well and yet this foundation still clings onto my dry skin. I have combination skin. I think for its performance it should be less expensive. * (Really bad) controversy aside, for the price the foundation doesn't perform well.

Its been almost a week- still recovering * Looked good at first but then i had a horrible break out. Hives all over my cheeks. Its been almost a week- still recovering * I was shocked to see the product ratings. This foundation is so lightweight that it doesnt even feel like I'm wearing foundation! My color match is perfect and when I wear this it truly looks like my natural skin without the discoloration of my bare skin. I have combination skin that gets really dry and flaky in some parts, and really oily in others so I tend to find a lot of foundations too dry and cakey or too oily and wet. With this foundation, I don't have either of those problems. This is the best foundation I've ever purchased, and I will continue to use this regularly from now on. * I love this product because it is so lightweight but buildable without feeling cakey. It lasts all day and doesnt make me feel oily. * For reference I have normal to dry skin, fairly clear with the occasional breakouts. I do have some discoloration from old scarring on my cheeks. Small pores and light texture.

I am a foundation hater, I have never been able to find one that DOESN'T look cakey or look like I don't have something on my skin. They always look like too much, even high end ones that people swear up and down look like your skin. Lies lies lies. So I took a final chance when I saw this one and I am so happy I did! This is the only foundation I will ever buy now, and I have recommended it to everyone especially the ones who feel the same way about foundation as I do. It is so skin-like and lightweight, I still feel like myself even with this on. I would say this is light coverage but can be built up to a medium coverage. I do set it with a light amount of powder and it looks beautiful. I do not have any issues with it seperating throughout a 12 hour work day, I get so many compliments from coworkers and strangers saying how beautiful my skin is! I apply it with a brush and then go over with a damp sponge then set with powder. Absolutely obsessed with this and I hope they never get rid of this, it is my one and only!! * Very light weight and almost full coverage * If you use an SPF primer (I recommend Tizo2) under your makeup, this will last literally 12+ hours - comfortable, pretty, natural and LIGHT ENOUGH SHADE that I don't have to add pigment drops just to get close to my skin tone (hallelujah)! In love!"

Does not blend well. * I bought this because I like the Bobbi Brown face primer. I enjoy the citrus scent of both. My skin feels great after application. The coverage is light and sheer but lasts. I apply it with a beauty blender sponge. I took a star off because coverage appears patchy on my neck. The packaging is easy to use. * My mother, in her mid 50's, absolutely loves this product. It feels great, has buildable coverage and has a great color to it. It looks great on older skin and has a very youthful glow. * After reading some of these reviews, I'm seeing that I'm not the only one with the streaking issue. For reference: I'm 41 with combination skin. 

I tried this on in-store. Wasn't in love with it, but Pür changed their tinted moisturizer's colors and they no longer looked good on my skin.

This tint has almost no coverage. It is watery and streaks. Be careful because it will just run out of the tube. It also clings to my dry spots (mostly my chin and around the nose).  I definitely moisturize before I put it on. I've tried it with a brush. I've tried it with a sponge. I've tried it with my fingertips. But it's all the same. It just looks horrible and I could not recommend this. * Super greasy and streaky whether you use a brush or sponge. I understand its a skin tint but has zero coverage. Separating on my nose and chin and will cling on to dry spots. 0/10 recommend * Left a rash after being on my skin for 2 minutes. The burning started and I washed it off immediately, and this is what I was left with. There is virtually no coverage. Buy a tinted sunscreen, or a better skin tint like the one from Ilia. * Should have taken the reviews seriously… If I had kept the box it would be returned…. It is a watery mess… There is a chemical odor… And the color is off…probably due to the consistency… I used the previous version of this product for years…and am extremely disappointed with this ""new and improved"" version of the product…. Nothing stays the same… What was wrong with old Tinted Moisturizer that it needed to be changed…watered down…? This was a total waste of money… this tinted moisturizer will go down drain where it belongs…! (Don't set the tube in the upright position on the cap…it will be a mess when opened…)"

I have been a fan of Black Opal for a Long Time. I love the coverage for my skin and you can mix if the color does not match at a great price! * I bought this foundation being of all the good reviews. Unfortunately the moment i put it on my skin the color was immediately to warm for my complexion, i got the heavenly honey. It looked WAY to orange and when i washed it off it looked like pure orange on my skin. It showed every ounce of texture on my skin (i dont have much texture) and sunk into every pore. Would not recommend at all. * Wanted a stick foundation for a light everyday makeup look. This is perfect! I use about 3 swipes on both sides of my face to even out my complexion. Blends best with a damp sponge followed by a foundation brush. Also love the neutral undertones!! * Love using this have been doing this now for 5 years. Have not been disappointed."

I threw it away and never finished it :( * This product sat really well on my face, matched my shade decently but it broke me out and made my skin itchy after.

This foundation offers amazing coverage while maintaining a natural look, making my skin appear flawless. The color match is perfect for my complexion, enhancing my features without looking cakey or heavy.
What truly impresses me is how this foundation performs like high-end brands, yet it comes at a fraction of the price. It blends effortlessly and lasts throughout the day, giving me that radiant glow I desire. 
I would definitely recommend Uvia's Place Magic Natural Radiance Foundation to anyone looking for a quality product that won't break the bank. It's a game changer in my makeup routine! * Been using the foundation for months now and I love it!! I've been getting a lot of compliments. I'm even on my second one. * Ive been using this foundation for over a year & I dont think I would ever stray from it or care to try another foundation again . Its blurring , smooth & CREAMY . easy to blend with a brush or a sponge . I have dry skin & it sits so perfectly, no patchiness or dry spots . Its velvety & i like the slight scent it has .

I mostly use it with my foundation, and its great for touching up areas that have worn off. It doesn't turn my foundations orange, like some other powder foundations do. I also like to use it over a lighter coverage foundation, or to fix the the tone of the foundations that look too yellow on me. It could be a little smoother, but like i said, for the price it's at, i cant complain! * I like the brand, but this product didn't work for me. It made my makeup look cakey and heavy, and it fell apart. * Its really affordable, which for me is good because I really dont want to spend much on makeup. Some days I'll use this alone just to absorb a little oil and shine, but usually I use it over a tinted moisturizer/spf and finish with a setting spray. Works best if you apply it with a brush. It blends well and stays on, and also covers all my acne and scars. Its never caused a breakout. The ingredients are pretty good, but occassionally a batch will smell different? Not sure why that is, theres no artificial fragrances which is a plus. The smell doesnt bother me. Give it a try! * I wanted to like this powder since Essence is a really affordable and great brand and I do really like many of their products. This powder did not work for me personally and sat very cakey on my face. It also would pill and look chalky as well. * This powder is beautiful. I have textured fair skin and this works wonders!! * This powder is beautiful. I have textured fair skin and this works wonders!! * I tried the powder on top of my tinted SPF.

I finally ordered it and it's ok. I took a quiz to see which color I should order since I've never ordered it before. Again it's only available online, so I can't go test the shades in the store. I am usually an ivory shade in other brands so I got the 220 creamy natural. When it came in, my first reaction was ""oh no"" my fear of ordering the wrong shade came true as the foundation looked really dark and orange. Since I already had it, I decided to test it anyway knowing full well it would not match, but it sort of did end up matching. The dark orange color was just like a film and it was lighter underneath and it blends really well. It feels really lightweight and breathable. It almost feels like you aren't even wearing make up, which makes sense since I found it to be very light coverage. I was hoping for medium to full coverage, but it just evened my skin out like a BB cream would do. I would still recommend it for the price, but wouldn't compare it to the KVD as that's how it was promoted to me. * I took the shade match quiz, the shade was way too light and when applied looks cakey and clings to dry patches. * I got this foundation in the lightest shade and its still too dark and orange. It cakes extremely bad even with two lifht layers. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone! * The cream-to-powder formula is fantastic! I use it alone (no concealer, highlighter, bronzer, blush) and it works great to cover up my acne scars and even out my complexion. However, I have noticed that it breaks me out really badly. I wish there was a clean formula for this type of product. * Right texture for me * 54 with dry skin. I was concerned about this product bc I normal stick to liquid foundation. I have tried almost every one out there but I was extremely surprised by this foundation! It was easily buildiable with smooth application. I was concerned at 1st the color match was a bit darker (245 warm beige) but after concealer & some pressed powder I had the most beautiful sun-kissed glow! For reference I love Nars in Santa-fe, Clinique  CN 40 cream chamois, Colourpop light 55N. I don't really see any skin type having an issue with this product. It was easy to apply, didn't feel heavy or cakey, never felt oily or dry, just smooth & silky. Highly recommend. No issues using other brand products with this foundation. I saw some saying it moves along or was patchy, follow the directions & build it. This is a cream to powder product so it will apply a bit different.  Will repurchase * LOVE LOVE THIS BLUSH"

None of them even came close to how perfect halo by smashbox. I literally just put on like sunscreen and it calms and covers my redness. I was worried cause the long chemical list but honestly nothing works as good as it. My skin glows and it blended right into my skin perfectly while hiding my redness. Doesn't look like I'm wearing anything at all. Just a sunscreen that absorbed into my skin and toned down all my redness. amazing product. Highly recommend * The coverage and tone on this product were great! I've had issues with patchy finishes with bb creams in the past, and this one worked so well! Definitely a winner. * I honestly really like smashbox's formulas when it comes to concealers and tinted mousturizer this one has no smell and has great pigment without sticking to fine lines. As a dry skin girlie its hard to find products that dont stick yo my texture so this one is definitely a win. It makes my skin look great and is also a great badd for other products with no pilling or weird texture reactions. I dont use this day to ray anymore but its a great on the go product that evenz skin tone easily and gives a flawless glowy finish * Really loved the coverage and color was a great match, but it made me break out :( I wanted this to work so badly because I thought the finish was beautiful and I loved the spf. Something in it gave me pimples so I won't be using it, but for those without sensitive skin I think it's great. * I couldn't find the right shade, I felt it was pulling at my skin too much-especially for a moisturizer product. Would not recommend * I've been using the Smashbox Halo Healthy Glow All-In-One Tinted Moisturizer, and overall, I'm pleased with its performance. The lightweight formula feels amazing on my skin, and it gives a lovely, natural glow while keeping my skin hydrated throughout the day. The SPF 25 is a great added bonus for daily wear, especially for quick, minimal-effort routines. That said, I do wish it offered just a bit more coverage. While it's perfect for those ""no-makeup makeup"" days, it doesn't quite conceal redness or blemishes as much as I would like. Still, it's a great option for those who prefer a sheer, healthy-looking finish with skincare benefits. *I received this product complimentary for my honest review * * I got it 2 months ago but I totally forgot it till today. Just tried it on. Feel light and matte on skin. The colour Light Medium is quite suitable for my Asian skin tone. I score it 8 out of 10. I definitely buy it again. Always love Smashbox products."

This stuff sticks to dry patches and accentuates fine lines. Yes, ita full coverage…when you try spreading it around its so thick it doesnt want to budge. Using a damp beauty blender works way better than a brush. But sadky, i wont be repurchasing. I will use thos to cover some areas on my cheeks,  ur wont ve a full face foundation for me. * Terrible. Does not spread nice. Makes my skin look grainy. Waste of money. * Love the feel of this foundation and it stays on all day long! * This foundation is horrible. When I first got it out of the package, it was leaking and a liquid consistency. It was dripping all over the place! When applied to my face it wasn't easy to blend because it set in place so fast.

Coverage is not very good either. It's very thin and extremely oily. Usually I do like their other products but this is definitely not it. I have tried it both with primer and without. Neither way lasted all day as it just essentially slid off. * the coverage on this is amazing you can wear on it's own and leaves a beautiful glow but if you have oily skin like me i don't recommend, you'll look a mess lol * I had extremely high hopes for this product. I read all the reviews watched the YouTube videos and was ready to go.  First I tried the shade Punta Cana (5) and it was too dark. Then I went back and got the shady Giza (6) and it was too late, so I decided to mix both of them together, hoping it would balance out. I don't understand how a product can have so much pigment but no coverage if that makes sense.  The product is highly pigmented and when you put it on, you can clearly see there's makeup on your face however, I have a few blemishesthat it provided coverage 0 coverage for.  It didn't matter how much product I went back and dabbed on the blemishes still no coverage. I even let it sit and dry down hoping that would thicken it up but still no coverage.  Also, it was not glowing or dewy for me. I looked straight up Greasy, even with just the first layer, I looked sweaty like I had been out in the sun. It was not a flattering look. I even tried powdering it down, but it just looked greasy with powder on top which basically turned cakey and even with all that I could still see my blemishes through.  I purchased this this evening and I will be returning it immediately when the store opens tomorrow.  I love Juvia's Places' products and I will still continue to support and purchase, but this just didn't work for me.  Buyer beware."

Color match was great and does not oxidize, but that's where the pros ended for me. Definitely not full coverage, didn't blend well and shifts/splotchy. If you're an oilslick like me… this is a total waste. Maybe good for dryer skin? Going back to Dior at this price point and won't be purchasing this one again. * This foundation brought out texture and wrinkles I have never seen before. It is not very blend-able, as it takes a lot of manipulation to look somewhat acceptable. This product is very drying and I have oily skin. Not to mention it does not adhere to the skin, it slips and sides off your face throughout the day leaving you patchy. * I finally found my holy grail foundation, I didn't even buy it at Ulta but that's how much I loved it to write a review. It feels like I'm wearing nothing, it matches my skin perfectly which has been a nightmare for years trying to find a good match. * This coverage is a lot more sheer and dewy than I had anticipated. This would be a beautiful foundation for someone with dry, mature skin since it does not crease. The colors are not accurate either. I suggest ordering one to two shades darker. * I need to keep looking. I have a full bottle that I hope to find someone that it works for."

I think you'll like it. * This foundation is so perfect for me. It blends perfectly into my skin. It's so easy to apply. I just dab it on with a beauty sponge and I'm done in minutes! 
I love it ❤️ * I'm not sure why my skin reacts to foundation so terribly, but even the luxury brands make me look a little off. I know my undertone and have been able to pinpoint my exact color profile, so it's not that. Foundation usually sits on top of my face, amplifies my fine lines, and makes me look like a hot mess. Age Perfect Tinted Balm is the only foundation that makes me look better, and I wish I knew about it sooner. It's my favorite! * I have what the skincare industry refers to as ""mature ""skin. I am a make junkie and I had many foundations from drugstores and major department stores but as I got older they all made me look cake and settled into lines. I stumbled on this product and I love it. It's my skin only better. It lasts almost all day on my  combination oily dry skin. It is a wonderful product with light medium coverage for mature skin. Will definitely buy again * I've used 3 pots of this now and I'm still somehow surprised by how nice it is. The formula feels like it won't cover much, but it softens the appearance of/seems to fill and even out pores, scars, wrinkles, or any textures--I often get compliments on how smooth my skin looks when I use this. I've gone back and forth between two colors because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the color match is a little difficult. All in all, I keep trying new foundations just to come back to this one and be impressed by it. * I'm a light-medium skin tone that leans towards cool. I got started on this because an influencer raved about it a few yrs. ago. I decided to try it and couldn't had been more thrilled. I use shade fair 20 for reference. In the pot it looks more like a peach shade. It glides on effortlessly and melts into my skin. My dry/mature skin looks healthy. I'm sure I will get tired of this foundation, but for the last 3 yrs. I've been pleased. Only time will tell. * I was very skeptical to try this and was shocked. It is so good. 47 year old combo skin, apply with real techniques dense brush and its better than high end.

I actually found it quite drying. I love HG products and am so glad Ulta is carrying them. I hope they'll carry the newer HG skin tint so I can try that one. * Im 55 and my skin is very dry, this product is moisturizing and never settles in my pores , an excellent alternative to foundation which just sat on my skin, this tinted moisturizer does not do that. I would highly recommend this product- * I have never had so many compliments about my skin since using this tinted moisturizer! It may not be for anyone needing full coverage makeup but someone looking for a glow and slight coverage! * It was very hard to find something for my aging skin that is full coverage, but doesn't settle into lines and look caked on. this was recommended in store and I absolutely love it! I apply with a beauty blender and use shape tape concealer with a tiny bit of setting powder. Really makes a difference being hyaluronic and any pictures while wearing come out great. A must in my drawer. * I wanted to like this. I have dry skin and some creepiness at 52. This made all of that worse.

It's very thick and kinda hard to blend out even with moisturizer and primer. 
I had to return this and buy the Too Faced brand hydrating liquid foundation. * Several comments said this was medium to full coverage which made me want to try it and it is not. There is absolutely no coverage at all. If anything it's just a glorified moisturizer so I'm thinking those other comments were for a different product. * Absolutely one of my favorite foundation. I love how it leaves my skin glowing and hydrated!"
146,jane iredale,refillable compact,pimprod2031651,2595249," * Tried to purchase this compact in the 21 Days of Beauty promotional, but couldn't add it to my cart, was it sold out?  Imagine my surprise the following day when it was available again at full price. Bait and switch advertising...not cool. * The discontinued gold compact was perfectly thin and light weight, making it easy to carry everyday. Also great for touch-ups when mineral foundation SPF is needed out in the sun! The closing latch wasn't super secure but I never had a problem with it opening in my purse. The new design is thick and super heavy. It's beautiful to sit on a counter, but useless weight for travel or carried in a shoulder bag. So sad I never odered backs up of the slim gold-tone compact! * I was surprised how expensive this compact is. But I have had so many contacts break and then I get crumbled pressed powder. This one looks like it will hold up well. I will let you know the first time I drop it-Yikes! * Very happy with this new compact. My JI mineral foundation stores securely,  the compact opens easily and now has a mirror. Yay! * I am a loyal Jane Iredale brand user. In fact, I have been using their products for over 20 years. The Jane Iredale line was recommended to me by the surgeon who did facial reconstruction after skin cancer surgery. 

Although I love their products, I have always been ""ehh"" about their packaging....until now! Thanks for finally giving up the gaudy gold (sorry, Jane Iredale) and going with this new, modern and aesthetically pleasing line of packaging. Since I have several of the old gold compacts, including the gold metals ones, I ordered one of the new compacts to see how I would like it. After receiving the new compact, I cannot wait to replace ALL my older versions! 

One more suggestion... in your future development, please consider making your eye shadows available in refills. I love the idea of being kinder to our planet and saving on the excess packaging. I do not mind paying separately for the cases if I know if is making a smaller, greener impact for future generations. =)

One final note of thanks to Ulta...I have been begging my local store to start carrying Jane Iredale. I am glad to see that you are at least finally carrying this amazing, clean line of makeup online! * I bought this on sale and I'm glad I did. It just makes it nice to put your foundation in. For the price of the foundation, it's a shame you have to purchase compact separately. * This packaging is overpriced and by default should be included with the powder. Waste of money."
147,nudestix,tinted cover foundation,pimprod2008837,2552723," * I actually love this foundation bc i have blemish free skin and us it to even out hyperpigmentation. The issue is the pump… it does not pull product well after tube is no longer full and it doesn't come off. So its just wasted product. * Of course it doesn't fully cover blemishes, its not full coverage. I buy this again & again & pair it with concealer for under eyes / blemishes , & blush. Its so smooth, never breaks out my acne prone skin. I love it so much!! * Honestly I hate foundation, I have super sensitive skin and anything can break me out easily. This foundation is SO NICE!! It is more like a skin tint than a foundation, which I prefer if I do ever wear it, the smell is relaxing (if you're not an essential oil person I wouldn't recommend, the lavender is pretty strong), and it doesn't feel like anything is on. For my Florida girls this stuff is a great quick fix for the hot and humid days!! * I have super sensitive, rosacea-prone skin & my eyes are really easily irritated by makeup (ocular rosace) that started a few years ago - suddenly I couldn't wear my favorite makeup without breaking out, & my eyes burning, bright red. I searched & finally found a brand specifically for rosacea-prone skin! So happy to be able to wear makeup again! Over the last year or so the formula clearly changed - I couldn't find a color match & then my eyes started to  burn again. Back to the search - finally found this - I love this foundation & the whole product line! It's light & looks great - as others have said, I look like myself, only better! It doesn't settle in my lines or pores, doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It does feel a bit oily / has a bit of shine. Also, Nude 3 is a perfect color match for me when it goes on, but it does darken a bit across the day so I'm going to try 2.5 & save 3 for the summer. Otherwise, highly recommend!! * I bought this foundation and love it.  I'm 47 years old with dry and pigmented skin from aging and I like light coverage products due to aging skin look more natural than full coverage foundation.  Very moisturizing.  I still set with loose powder and yes would buy this as long as nudestix still made this. * I got this product in shades light3 it a good tinted moisturizer with light to medium at most.  Great for dry skin.  Love this product. * Flawless and lightweight. I'm in love."

149,uoma beauty,say what?! foundation,pimprod2033346,2593663," * I was hoping this product would perform close to the Becca foundation that you can no longer get.
It's OK but not a go to foundation. It's more watery in my opinion and coverage has to be worked on quite a bit. 
I am sorry, but for me it's not what I was hoping for. * I dont teally wear foundation but gor aome reaaon wanted to try  this one and it was on sale . I am SO happy with it ! It wasnt heavy and it didnt cake up !  I am beyond happy * I LOVE this, I currently have 9 foundations(yes I counted) that I rotate through and I wish I found this sooner. I love how it lays on my face and makes my 42 year old skin look amazing. I will say that it will pill if you do not let your primer set. * I got shade TN1. The formula is great- relatively clean, with a soft matte finish. It also did not upset my very sensitive skin. This would be one of the BEST foundations if the color wasn't so wrong. If you can find a shade that works, go for it * Is so loose * if you want to struggle to blend your foundation and then have it reveal every line, bump and pore then this is for you. * Very textured and dry result. I have dry skin, so maybe if you're oily you won't mind. I wore the fairest shade. Doesn't perform or last, but packaging is pretty at least."

The last few compacts I've bought have cracked from barely any use. I had to dump the powder into a different container and use it that way. * so I do a full face every day. every once in a while I'll ""cheat"" and use this product to save time. it works sooo well. I use a light shade which I chose by pretty much matching my neck/highlight areas and use it mainly in my T zone. highlighting under eyes, forehead between brows chin and then I also add it along my jawline. then I go about my routine as normal but without the need for foundation highlight and baking. saves so much time! it builds well and has amazing coverage. it lasts all day. I have mature skin and hate when things settle into fine lines and wrinkles and I do not have that problem with this. it actually makes my skin appear younger compared to my full face routine with baking etc. I know I hav to find a new foundation to help avoid it but who has the time lol anyway... YES. this product is one I want to hoard in case it ever goes away. it's amazing. I use it with a compact dense brush. 

only downside is that I broke 2... but it's because I throw it in my purse and I know that's not ideal and on me for being careless. but if it's getting tossed around, be aware the powder may break. * This is a must have in my kit! I use it to lightly set my foundation and it transforms my face! I have also used it as a powder foundation for summer days and it is flawless! * This is the best powder foundation i have ever tried, i reach for this one over my high end one. Its my go to during the summer months. * Medium to full coverage. I like to carry it in my bag for touch ups because it covers the redness around the nose, i can cover up some my blemishes that peak out after wearing makeup all day etc * I use the shade Natural and I absolutely love this powder. i've used mine all the way to the pan and just restocked a new one. Literally the most beautiful blurring coverage, doesn't feel cakey or drying and my skin looks flawless. Great for on the go and quick touch ups. I usually hate the feeling of wearing heavy foundations and powders so once I found this it was over. Super breathable and comfortable and evens out my skin tone in a couple quick pass overs. I love this product. * Medium to high coverage, smoothing, non-comedogenic. Its a bit hard to shade match. I use Soft Tan in this powder and Nars Valencia, Lisa Eldridge 19, Estee Lauder 4w1."

I like that it is paraben free, affordable, has beautiful natural looking medium coverage, is hydrating, and actually has shades that match my medium yellowy-olive skin tone.
It looks like my bare skin but more even. I can't speak to the longevity because I don't really pay attention to that, haha. 
Yes it does totally smell like what you would paint your wall with! I'm willing to put up with it for an affordable paraben free option that actually matches my skin. * I love this and would buy it again... only a shade lighter. * Got this foundation about 2 weeks ago… just don't even look into this product.

I won't recommend this item. * I have been using this since it was introduced to the Revlon line and my hope is that this never gets discontinued.🙌🏻 I love the ingredients in this foundation and the coverage is amazing. It does not settle in my lines; it actually plumps my skin (hyaluronic acid 🙌🏻🩵👏🏻🤩) and gives a flawless finish. I also have extremely sensitive skin and my face does not react to this at all. It seems a lot of brands are now incorporating good skincare ingredients in foundations and this one is a winner! 🥇🙌🏻👏🏻"

Its patchy and gross feeling. * I wore this last night and actually liked how it applied (first time I tried it, it did pill) and wore. Woke up this morning with a forehead full of bumps :( I know there are benefits for some, but the niacinamide really messed with my skin * This would be my holy grail foundation IF it wasn't so frustrating to apply. I have extremely dry skin and this tint gives just enough coverage to make my skin look radiant and healthy. It does not transfer, does not stick to or accentuate dry spots, and the shade range goes light enough for me, which usually isn't the case for tints with limited shades. HOWEVER, this stuff is an absolute nightmare to apply. If you accidentally touch it with your brush or sponge after it dries down (which takes only a few seconds), it will pill and come off your face. The only way I've found to fix this is to remove it and start over. Maybe I'm applying it wrong, but I've tried different primers, applicators, etc., all with the same result. I really wish it wasn't so hard to apply because I love the finish, but I won't be repurchasing because of this. * I have sensitive, oily, and redness-prone skin, so moisturizers usually dont work on me. Im plesently suprised on how well this works with my skin chemistry. The coverage is very much buildable, some days i put just a tiny bit on to moisturize and even out my skin-tone, othertimes i build it up for more coverage. Only downside is the occasional pilling that others here mentioned, but its subtle enough. * I love this.  I apply after i ise a moisturizer.  Provides supermligbt coverage to even out skin tone. I use the shade 15 which has a yellow indertone rather than red. * It has great ingredients but it jusy peels right off the face. It doesnt stick at all it immediatly pills its unwearable which sucks cuz i love the ingredients"
154,revlon,illuminance serum tint,pimprod2042614,2618859," * I have been looking for a light Tinted foundation with SPF. This one is amazing.  It covers just enough without you feeling overly made up. It was on sale andvi do not regret trying it out. I will buy it again. * I have gotten many compliments at work about my skin since using this product. My skin is plumper, softer, radiant and smoother. Hint when applying make sure your skin is moisturized and use a sponge to apply or it will pile if you rub it to much. * I love the no makeup only skin effect I get with this product.  Evens my skin tone and mixes well with my sunscreen * I'm usually a prestige foundation only girly but this worked great for me. Its great for a light foundation or light coverage days. It helped even out my skin tone. It is nice but it will get into wrinkles like the one I have in the middle of my brow. However, I just pat it down and call it a day. Nice product for the price range. * This serum tint has a nice smooth consistency, covers well, and goes on easily. Good color choices for most skin tones. I have combination skin, more dry than oily, and the serum in this tint is just right. For the price point, it's worth a try. * I bought this on a whim, and it exceeded my expectations.  It goes on so smoothly, the coverage is that of a foundation, but it's still light enough to feel like a tinted moisturizer.  Would definitely purchase this again * I've tried many foundations and serum tints from  drugstore to high end. I love this Serum Tint!!! Medium coverage with a soft glow effect to your complexion. Easy to apply with a good foundation brush or finger tips. I do use a primer but not really necessary. Big bang for your bucks.  Good skin benefits too."

Great for older skin! * First time trying this product but I will get more * I absolutely love this tint for the summer. Apply with a brush for higher coverage, about two layers. I struggle with acne scars, in those areas I apply glossier concealer and feel satisfied. During the winter I see myself applying this for running errands or more lowkey events. I get a lot of compliments with this tint at this time of the year for its radiance. * I've been using this for a little over a month and was having postpartum breakouts prior to it, thsi helped soothe my skin and stopped mh breakouts. I work in a cooler all day so trust this helps my skin! * I will say that I have used this product in the past. Its not too bad for the price of the product. However, the coverage is very light and not really buildable. Although, I do like how it gives a somewhat dewy effect. I also like how it has clean ingredients! So if you like dewy foundation, light coverage, and clean ingredients then this product might be for you. * I rarely wear foundation, largely because I hate how heavy it feels on my face, and I also love my freckles and foundations tend to cover them. I bought this out of curiosity and I'm surprisingly happy with the result! It's a pretty watery consistency, but that means A) a little goes a long way, especially when applied with a foundation brush, and B) it feels so light on my face!! It evened out my skin tone (as someone with vitiligo, this is always a big win!!) without totally covering my freckles. It looks super natural, too. I appreciate the price for the amount of product and the fact that it has no scent. 

The one con for me is that my nose felt kind of greasy a few hours later—but the rest of my face felt pretty dry, so that could just be my overactive pores LOL.

For reference, I am very pale (and I have vitiligo). I'm using shade 520- Fair. * It smelt soooo bad bro, i put it on twice, once to try and another to actually go out and then when i did it to go out it started peeling and looked SOOOOO cakey, like cakier than cakey. It smells TERRIBLE, when i was applying it i had to hurry since it smelt sooo bad, i can even explain fbe scent, but its just plain terrible, dont recommend"

It also looks a bit cakey but i highly recomend spraying do we setting spray onto your brush/sponge, and then blending out. * I normally wear Estee stay matte foundation but I was out and until it arrived I needed something in the meantime. I wore this out, was standing in the parking lot talking to my friends and some random lady walked up to us and said ""sorry to interupt but I just have to tell you, you are stunning"" ( she was talking to me) And then she walked off. I was never told that when I wore the Estee! What the heck, this stuff is GOLD. * I have been using this foundation for 5 years now. I will say it is not full coverage but it is buildable. This foundation feels so lightweight & it gives such a natural look. I've tried other foundations but always come back to this one cause its just so good! I tend to have an oily T-zone & everywhere else is pretty much dry but this foundation doesn't ever really cake or flake on me. I 100% recommend this foundation for an everyday natural look! * I love this foundation! it's affordable and stays on all throughout the work day * this foundation is surprisingly good for the price. it's buildable, smooth, and has a nice matte but natural finish. it flaked on my chin area after a few hours, but that could be my skin type. * Love this for my combo skin. I'm not extremely oily but I needed something that would actually last throughout the day without needing to powder by midday. I actually like it better than the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I am shade 090 in Lancome but have not been able to find a good color match as 090 is too light and the next shades are too dark and orange. I have very fair neutral skin. I prefer how the covergirl looks, it is very smooth with slightly better coverage, and L20 is a great shade and a closer match than the Lancome (maybe L20 is a dash too light but it looks perfect after bronzer). It gives a natural matte finish that doesn't cling or look cakey. Works well on my middle-age skin with fine lines. Has great medium-full coverage. Highly recommend! * I really love this foundation and I will continue to purchase it! Affordable and covers well."

It did get a bit shiny though. * My skin is more dry during the winter months! So far so good i love the coverage and the shade was perfect for me.

Then it was impossible to blend out on my face and ruined my makeup ): * I love this powder this is the best powder that I have discovered as of lately. Elf kills it with all the products they release but this is top tier. * I really wanted to like this product, but even though I moisturize my skin, it leaves randow streaks on my face, as if i applied it with a paint brush. And leaves weird marks on my nose that I cant blend out and have to literally use my nails to scratch off. I have oily skin and never experienced this with a powder foundation. * I have fair skin and got the recommended color. It's too yellow for me and honestly isn't as good as the dermablend camo. I only got it because I can't find the dermablend camo anywhere. This doesn't stay on my skin very well and rubs off so easily. * I am 39 years old, and I have struggled to find a powder foundation that would work for my combo skin, I have spent tons of money, looked high and low, and have never been happy with anything that I found in the past. I could not believe how well, this held up for me! I am 39 years old and I had a baby nine months ago and don't have much time to do my make up but I still wanna look half decent when I have to go out of the house and this is quick and easy and effortless, I highly recommend this to anybody who cannot seem to find a powder foundation that works for them, maybe you might meet your match with this one. I do use the little sponge that comes with the powder because it works for me and I don't want to try to mess withthe system lol. * If your ever going for a simple quick look thsi is the foundation powder to use, the shade match is incredible accurate,decent coverage for a sinple quick look. I definitely recommend!!"
162,ulta beauty collection,velvet matte longwear foundation,pimprod2020823,2560234," * This foundation is definitely not for beginners. Its not lightweight, and could be tricky to apply. I'm someone who needs a heavier foundation becasue my face gets super oily, so I've had experiences with thicker foundations. I like to apply it with my fingers, and then blend it in with a damp sponge. It lasts pretty long, especially with a setting powder and is a heavy duty foundation. I wouldn't recommend this product if you have dry or normal skin, but its a pretty good option for skin that needs some oil control, especially for the price. 

The thing I don't like about it is that the colors look too yellow on me (even the lightest shades) and that it starts to make my pores more visible after some time. * I would look like one of those powdered face men from the 1800s if i wore this. * This foundation came and did exactly what it said it would and did not disappoint. Definitely pleased with the application and effect of coverage. Obviously anything works best if you have a daily skin prep-care routine like priming and moisturizing, especially since this is full coverage as opposed to a soft focus/medium coverage. 
**
-If you have dry skin and don't moisturize it's not going to have the desired velvety and blurred consistency, especially over pores and anywhere your skin creases. You won't have to worry about reapplying but if you need to blot or erase an oily area, it looks fantastic when paired with an adjustable coverage powder foundation!!
-No need to worry about concealer since it's basically built in. 
-Also, for anyone who is used to set-spraying each layer of face makeup just keep in mind it's a thicker liquid and sets in tight so just be sure to finish blending anything else before setting it. 
-Typically this product blends best with either fingers or a silicone sponge - anything it cant seep or dry into. * The texture of this was not good. I didn't "" use a primer, but I never do and there usually isn't a problem. * Picked this up on a whim. I thought it would be similar to MUFE Matte Velvet Skin because of the name, but it's more comparable to Huda Beauty Faux Filter foundation IMO. Very thick and not the easiest to blend, especially down your neck or in the creases of your nose. It starts drying basically the moment you put it on your face, which doesn't help with blending. Bought shade Fair Cool and it goes on practically white, but does dry down darker.

An okay foundation for the price you pay, but there are better ones out there. * This foundation is incredibly thick, making it hard to blend. My face looks overly dry, even with moisturizer and primer. * I have very oily acne prone skin and i live in humid florida, and travel often. If you need to cover blemishes and acne this is your stuff, a veey little goes a longggg way, full coverge not too heavy and it doesn't cake up, you need to use a moisturizer under as it can be drying, which is perfect if you have oily skin like me. I stopped buying high end dermablend and this is a very affordable replacement"

I live in Italy and was introduced to this brand by one of my girlfriends.All of their stuff is amazing. This foundation is great but definitely runs a bit warmer than I expected. I'm usually light neutral or 35N and grabbed shade 30N, it was darker than expected and waaaay too yellow on me. * I love this foundation * I was hesitant at first ,because I just heard from this brand but I'm glad i gave it a try. And it was on sale 😁 felt good on my face. I used it and yes it was worth it the staying power  was good specially of your from az. * Have a hard time matching foundation to my skin tone and this matches me perfectly. It looks natural and has buildable coverage. For the price, you cannot beat it, I own foundations double the price and this is now my go to. Give it a shot. :D * I bought this like a month ago and I love it! You dont have to use a lot and literally your face is flawless. One of the things i love about this product is it doesnt dry out your skin. I got the shade neutral 25 and id say that its a mix of fair and tan. I also really love the application part of it, the wand is really nice!!! * Covers a lot without having to apply a ton. Love the application wand * I love this foundation I find myself reaching for it more  often than the others. it's not drying, not greasy,  the coverage looks like my skin but glowy, and not cakey. The kiko Milano powder is awesome too for baking BTW. This foundation is way very similar to TF Born this way foundation, (but not as greasy) kiko milano is underrated IMO. Yes I would recommend."
164,well people,bio stick foundation,pimprod2008575,2553269," * The old formula truly was the best, I looked forward to applying it every morning.  Blended like a dream, gorgeous satin finish, blurred imperfections, clean and fragrance free.  The color 1C was actually a cool tone, this new 1C is PEACH toned....very warm, and the formula change truly makes me sad....it's not the same. They ruined a perfect product. * I absolutely love this product! The smell is a bit strong and the application is a little off-putting, but it blends great and looks great! I found that instead of using a traditional primer like elf power grip, using a setting spray to prime made application easier and blending smoother. * My skin looked worse with this. Highlighying pores no matter how much or how many different methods i use. And shows every bump, dry patch, etc. its so weird. Like the opposite of why we wear makeup in the first place. So mad i was fooled that im writing a review * I have very fair and pink skin and have always had trouble finding foundations that match my tone, never mind work well on my oily/combination skin, but I will say that this one does a good job! I was nervous buying online without match testing, but I got the 1C and would say its a pretty good match for my skin tone. 

My pros for this are definitely: generaly matches my skin, works well with my oily/combination skin, it coming in a stick format is very convenient and mess free, stays on very well, looks natural, and doesnt make my skin feel gross

My cons would be: not the perfect match (wish the undertones were more p and that the shade was slightly lighter), can get a little cakey if i put too much on, and a little hard to blend. 

For context I've been wearing Too Faced Born this way foundation in the shade Snow for years now because it's the only foundation I've found that comes close to matching my skin, but I've always run into the same problem of not being able to apply the foundation too thick because then you can tell it's not a true match. Anyway, I would say overall thi one does a better job, has better ingredients, feels better on my skin, and is a good price point.

My last points would be dont let the 1 star reviews scare you, this foundation is very nice and as long as you use a wet sponge to apply and don't mind the mild scent of castor oil that fades in about 30 minutes :) * The old formula was amazing.  Shade 1C was a perfect cool tone as described.  This newer version is very peach in tone and no longer qualifies as cool toned.  So  if you are a fair, cool toned person...look elsewhere. * I have come back to this product again and again after trying other hydrating foundations that are too thin and messy or settle into pores. This is my favorite non-SPF foundation. It is like a natural version of cover girl compact makeup. It's vegetable oil based so it does smell like olive oil. But it's so nourishing and convenient with the solid stick. It smooths on well to a medium coverage and natural dewy finish that doesn't settle into my pores or cause breakouts for me. And with a light powder to set, it stays all day. I do wish they had lighter shades as the lightest warm (2W) is a bit dark for me in winter. But I'm a repeat customer of this good clean dry skin foundation option. * This brand is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I live in the desert and ingredients like hyaluronic acid just pull the water out of your skin because there's no water in the air here. It seemed like every make up and skincare brand hopped on that train and I couldn't find anything for my skin (dry) and climate type. I hope they never change the formula! I'm almost 30 and I'm starting to get crows ft etc and this really does a great job of camouflage without settling in any wrinkles."

It was easy to blend and didnt make me feel cakey or end up patchy at the end of the day. It evened my skin tone out very nicely! My boyfriend didnt even know I was wearing makeup but I felt like I still got the coverage/effect I was going for. Definitely recommend trying it out! * I use this everyday! Lightweight yet covers what it needs to * it creases
168,kvd beauty,lock-it foundation,pimprod2018138,2570570," * Coverage is amazing.  I can't find my shade anywhere anymore
I tried the Good Apple version
 There's no Comparison... bring this back * I need this to come back!!! I haven't found anything that i really like. * I bought this product for many years and I always loved it. However since Kat sold the product off its formula has changed for the worse. I've tried the new version and it's awful I've tried fenti, tarte, double wear, and two others they all suck! * Mine always smelled like paint. Super thick, matte and cakey but superior coverage to anything made ever. * Please bring it back!!!! Nothing compares * My favorite and un replaceable foundation. I haven't found a similar to this one not one!!! This is the best foundation for OILY skin and tge coverage amazing. Loved that it last all day mind you i live in Az and the weather is HOT this foundation would not move at all. Pleas eplease being this back because Good Apple is not close at all in coverage and wear. * This was the only matte foundation i found that made my textred mature skin not look more textured and makes me look older like all other matte foundations I've tried! This one looks so amazing. Stayed all day and i sweat alot on my face. I really dont know why they got rid of this foundation. I literally have not one bad thing to say about this foundation. I really hope they bring this back!!!"
169,lorac,pro soft focus longwear foundation,pimprod2013331,2558415," * This is my new favorite foundation,
! It has excellent coverage with a natural finish. I have dry skin but find a lot of the hydrating foundations transfer and/or leave my skin looking oily by the end of the day, this foundation looks good all day and doesn't transfer. It does have a incredibly potent smell that lingers long after it dries, but I have been able to get used to it and I only notice when during application. * Although I like this foundation in everyway I have to give a low score because it isn't CRUELTY FREE.   There is no good reason for testing on animals and there are plenty of good products available which ARE CRUELTY FREE too. * I purchased this on a whim as i saw it on sale. I received it at the same time another package with the new Prada foundation came in, and I'm shocked that i like the Lorac foundation more than the Prada!  I applied this with my Hourglass foundation brush as the formula is quite thin amd it went on beautifully. Its so smooth and the finish really is a soft matte. It seems to be very long lasting as well. My first favorite foundation of the year. * I finally got my hands on this foundation and I wore it and loved it right away! I will say if you're sensitive to smells it does smell like paint but it will fade. This foundations lasts all day and blurred my acne scared skin & pores. obsessed! * Lorac left no choice but to select this when they quit making the PoreFection foundation.  This has no sunscreen and it has an odor similar to molasses. I use it because it doesn't break my face out. * I love it one of the reasons I love it is because it doesn't crease and settle in my  lines and it's very very hard to find products they don't do that. I can't get over the coverage when I first tried it I was so skeptical, because it is runny and well, it just didn't seem like it was gonna be that great…! And it is in my opinion…  To apply it I use a beauty blender and it goes on amazing and for me honestly a little bit goes a long way. … I have large pores texturize skin, but yet this one seems to work good for me and not feel too heavy.… I wouldn't say it's totally water resistant, but good enough because let me tell you I've cried while having it on and it does not streak not at all at least not for me and like I said,  I'm almost 46 years old. I'm a 45 year old woman so it's been a struggle for me and I know other people have been saying a lot of different things then I am saying, but I know for me personally it is one of my favorites and always will be! And I highly recommend for more mature skin… I really really do … I have used a brush with it before and it does work good as well. Not a matte either. Just a beautiful natural finish not too dewy. Put it to you this way whenever I use the Lorac foundation, I always get compliments oh, and before I forget, it does not crease on my eyelids, and that is one of my biggest pet peeves ever 😂. * Since the perfection foundation was discontinued I thought this pro version would somehow be better. It is not. It is very heavy coverage and cakes on. It truely smells like maple syrup. Laura Mercier makes a tinted moisturizer w SPF that is more like porefection formerly by Lorac."
170,kiko milano,active foundation,pimprod2036981,2607365," * Ok, there are a lot of decent stick foundations out now (not great, but decent).  I don't think this is one of them.  It's the old school sort--the kind that feels very waxy.  If you have dry skin, you will not be pleased.  It's very hard to get the finish to look good, and even harder to get it to stay looking good.  It's probably not going to save you time or make your life easier on the go. * I am blown away by how amazing this stick foundation is!! It gives a barely there feeling which i love. It does not settle into fine lines and stays on all day. Can't wait to try more stuff from the brand!!! * This stick goes on sooo smoothly! Absolutely love the consistency of this makeup! My skin looked like a barely there makeup look, exactly what i was going for. Definitely need to extend the shade range of this makeup but other than that this stuff is amazing!! * great coverage for my skin tone and felt smooth.  please add more skin tones so all people can have it. * this shade range has every type of tone for lighter skin but for 1 dark complexion do better * I honestly dont unserstand why people who've never tried this give it a low rating due to the shade range. This is an Italian owned brand. Majority of the population is olive, light to medium skintones. Many of them/us have a hard time finding our shades. Go try Fenty Beauty if you dont like it. Anyways, this is fantastic. Super blendable and looks smooth on my texture. * the shade range is disgusting. its not like italy is a sheltered country or anything, many POC reside there. darker women, men, and all in between deserve to have products that fit their skin too. do better."
171,maybelline,instant age rewind perfector 4-in-1 whipped matte makeup,pimprod2028923,2590459," * Its like it never dries and doesnt stick to your skin. So skin ends up looking splotchy. Wipes off easily and blends with nothing. Won't purchase again! * I have combination skin, super oily with dry patches. I hate the feeling of foundation so I just prefer something super light to even out my color and mattify me. This stuff is perfect! It feels completely weightless and looks natural. It wears off gradually by the end of the day without looking crazy. Definitely my favorite face makeup! * It wiped off easily didn't  stay on my face. I would use it in a certain spot and i would try and apply it somewhere else and it would wipe off * As for color match, it's perfect. But it doesn't really cover up my imperfections like age spots * Looks great on my skin. * Very light coverage. Feels so light and soft on skin. Not oily after a full day of wear! Doesn't cover blemishes the best but will give a nice even tone over the skin. Blends nicely! * I loved this! Its very light weight. I used under this my normal skin car rountine. And i wear elf glow sunscreen and halo glow with this bb cream and i loved the result. I do use conceler as well. And i dont feel caked on. Honestly try this method."
172,flower beauty,get real serum foundation,pimprod2022967,2577491," * I absolutely love this foundation! It is even better then the very high end products i have purchased.  Hydrated, natural looking skin is what my aging skin looks like when using it. I cannot believe what an absolute bargain this foundation is. I would gladly pay triple the price. I hope they never stop making it! * Moisturizing and glowy with light coverage, this foundation plays well with powder and cream cheek products on top. It does not layer itself well (looks very textured), however. No other complaints, as long as you like light coverage glow with a single layer of product I'd say you have found the best product in the market in this price range! Also stays preserved well, in case you're soemone that takes a while to go through product. * I LOVED the Light Illusion foundation! Then I tried this. WHAT a letdown. It is runny, thin, has NO coverage. THE COLOR( I wear L2  IVORY in Light Illusion) is also DARKER than LIGHT ILLUSION. The L2 Ivory is the same as the L4 warm beige. * I bought this on a whim on sale because ive heard good things and actually really like other flower products BUT this is was a let down I understand its a ""serum"" fondation and not meant to provide coverage thats fine what I DIDNT LIKE was the fact that i could not get this to stick to my skin it transferred and moved around and good luck trying to apply anything on top of it * I love serum foundations and this one did not disappoint! This one is up there with the more high end serum foundations in every way but without the crazy price tag. It is sheer - exactly what I like! - and blends like a dream. It has staying power and flattering shades. A little goes a long way. It plays well with other products both cream and powder. No moisturizer needed as it is very hydrating - my dry mature skin drinks this up and loves it! Very happy! * I've got combination skin with an oily t-zone and dry on my forehead and underneath my eyes, this doesn't bring any of this texture out! It's light coverage which I like for daily wear and for hot days. * It's so light! Def what I was looking for. Just a psa to anyone who wants to buy this, I'd suggest buying at AT THE store because I ordered it and received it with the product spilled. Still product in the bottle, but I for some reason can't put it sideways or it leaks. So if you order it online, be aware either the bottle is just awful or it broke while it was shipping to me. 
Other than that it's a wonderful product"
173,pacifica,ultra cc cream radiant foundation with 100% physical broad spectrum spf 17,pimprod2026038,2582152," * this doesn't blend well at all. it's streaky, it doesn't cover, it smells odd. it's just a horrible horrible product. * I have used this foundation for years but the formula has changed, and it is awful. It is so thick it won't pump out. The foundation is clumpy and doesn't spread at all. Why did they change a good product???? * This foundation is worth trying! Creamy, spreads nicely (I use a brush), nice colour matching (I consider myself a medium brown skin colour). Overall great product! * I cannot say enough GOOD THINGS about this CC cream. There comes the point when foundation is out, and CC cream is in, and I am pleased with this product's color choices, smooth texture, and luminescence. I mix two shades and apply the first color as a primer. This CC cream doubles as my concealer; it's that easy to apply. * This product: separates BADLY and doe not blend well at all; Smells weird and chemical-y; offers VERY little coverage, even for a CC cream, and is overpriced because of all these factors. Positives: it makes skin glowy and has SPF. I wouldn't buy this personally - Pacifica's skincare and fragrance are AMAZING, but makeup seems to be a weak point. * This product came out separated. Tried shaking product to get product mixed together and it came out somewhat like foundation. Does not go on skin nicely. Do not recommend. * it comes out as a clear oil with little specs of color that don't blend."

It is so hard for ne to find something that works for my skin and this has been amazing. * A gift card & a sale gave me this dream coverage. I am absolutely in love. This breathable, light satin finish can be set up on itself until youve found your inner teenage beauty queen! It's perfect for my skin type & it smells lovely too. A+ Ulta! * I love this lightweight easy to apply buildable foundation.  And so easy to match my complexion. * it appears that this foundation is being discontinued & I'm so upset. i have 51 y.o. mature, incredibly dry skin. this foundation is so wonderful & I have never found anything comparable. i need this in my makeup arsenal!!! * Please don't discontinue this item! It's the only foundation that works for my mature skin. It goes on so nice and smooth and cover just enough. Please please PLEASE bring back some of the lighter colors. * I bought this over the holidays and LOVED it!! Goes on easily and is weightless. Soooo disappointed to see that my shade is not available. Please do not discontinue this product. * My perfect shade is Light to Medium Cool.  Not available the last 2 times I've tried to buy.  What's up with that.  Not everybody needs a dark shade.  I would venture to say there are more who want lighter shades. Love the silky formula!"
175,blk/opl,true color mineral matte crÃ¨me powder foundation spf 15,pimprod2022221,2578383," * I have never had a more perfect color match in my entire life. I show this to the older women in my family and you would think I was literally doing a magic trick lol shock awe and wonder. I often and loudly recommend this in True Caramel. Perfect for lace on wigs or just on skin * The foundation is very smooth and moisturizing.  It provides medium coverage, so I build it by applying several applications to get a more full coverage.  It is a great product for the price. * I have purchased this product before and I liked it. This time the product was used. It had a finger smudge print on it when l opened it and the sponge applicator had make all on one side. I ended up purchasing something else at another store. * First, note this has the ingredients that Danessa Myricks uses for her foundation at an affordable cost. This provides a great shade match, makes skin look healthy and even, easy to take with you and stays on even if you sweat. The magnesium carbonate in the formula absolutely is wonderful for sweaty moments. I just find you can't really apply it with anything other than a sponge. Brushes with dense round tops don't pick it up well, as nothing else does. If you don't want to buy a beauty sponge you'll be fine to use the one it comes with. * Great shade for Hispanic women. * Too dark/matched my hand-too dark for my face * My mom loves this foundation and looks forward to trying more products from the line"
176,essence,keep me covered powder,pimprod2043728,2618266," * it has good coverage, but it does look pretty cakey. i also think i may have an allergy to something in it considering my face would start to tingle and get hot after putting it on. essence is a very hit or miss brand, and this is sadly a miss for me! * Amazing powder for the face! Gives amazing coverage and keeps foundation matte all day. Ive repurchased this over 6 times. * It is a wonderful color. Goes on so smooth.  It did come in broken. Was quite sad about that. It is still useable but very disappointing on the breakage. * Has a matte finish and keeps makeup on for a long period of time. * Unfortunately, I feel like essence has slowly started to decline over the years, this is the second powder from them that I have not liked. The powder did not blend well under my eyes at all, and instead turned cakey immediately. I tried putting it on other areas like my forhead and cheeks and it was the same issue. I had to go back and get another powder the next day because I couldn't handle it. Also, for some reason, it irritated my skin. I would not recommend this product. * This powder is not only affordable but it sits on my skin very nicely. I use it all over my face including my eyes. Pairs well with First Aid Beauty eye cream. * For the price this brand is solid. Would definitely recommend!"
177,blk/opl,pore perfecting liquid foundation,pimprod2022248,2578400," * The consistency of the foundation is wonderful. It's super light and just melts into the skin. The color range is also phenomenal. I've never found a shade that matched me so perfectly. It literally looks like my skin. All of my friends, family members, and coworkers inquire about the foundation I use, and I have to share the link often. * Great foundation for the price. And it has spf! * Matched me perfectly. Wasn't to heavy made me look flawless * Rubs off and oily I bought two hoping to return one * After searching & searching for the perfect blend/shade…..I'm completely satisfied…. * One of my favorite drugstore foundations. Try if you are on the fence. Con- It may transfer * I used it for coverage and even my tone."
178,l.a. girl,sheer skin tinted foundation,pimprod2025859,2581633," * i wanted something less full coverage, as it would crease in my smile lines, ans this does the trick! its a beautiful finish and lasts my full work shifts! no creasing either!!! * Why would the name be tinted foundation? Isnt all foundation tinted""? Maybe try tinted moisturizer * Light and hydrating product that evens out dull skin without looking heavy! Great for looking put together on minimal makeup days. * The coverage of this bad boy is wat too light to be called a foundation, but it doesnt have any skin care benefits which is I guess why they can't call it BB cream. It's refreshing to have a product with light coverage and a natural finish instead of dewy. Great for no makeup makeup days. * I found the Tawny shade of L.A. Girl Tinted Foundation in my local Ulta's clearance section and figured I'd give it a try. When I got home, I used Ulta's shade matcher and it told me I was really Warm Sand in this product (based off entering Ginger for bareMineral's COMPLEXION RESCUE Tinted Moisturizer Mineral SPF 30). Warm Sand perfectly matches my skin right now during the winter. I'll try Tawny again in the spring/summer, but it was a close match too. I love how lightweight this product feels and how easy it is to apply — I dot it on right from the tube and the dab/blend with a lightly moist makeup sponge. It looks just slightly dewy but doesn't feel overly wet or sticky. It also works well under my bareMinerals BAREPRO 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation if I want to look more made up, but between the price and its natural look when used solo, it fits well with my minimalist approach to makeup. * I am 66 years old. It settled into my wrinkles and emphasized them.  Very sheer coverage. Not a good choice for me. * This is amazingggg!! it's creamy and dries so you don't need any powder, the finish is a natural satin finish and i have dry skin NC42 and the tan is perfection!"
179,well people,bio powder foundation,pimprod2008579,2553264," * Light, sheer. Shade range is confusing. If unsure, go a bit darker than normal. * I ordered 2W - Warm light - and it was almost white, so light and clearly defective. It did absolutely nothing other than make me have a Casper look. It is so sheer I can't imagine it doing anything even if it was the correct color.  I contacted Well People, I thought they should know how bad the product was, and they didn't care. * W3ll people... we need to talk about the shade range. People with darker skin tones like makeup too yet the shade range completely excludes anyone beyond tan. Thankfully the darkest shade works for me so I enjoy the product but it's hard to get behind a brand that doesn't give darker skintones a thought. * I was really hoping this product would work for me but it didn't. I found the baked foundation to be much more drying than other pressed powders I've previously used. Felt like it didn't go on well and had horrible coverage. Will not be buying again. * Takes forever to build up. Not for anyone who wants medium to full coverage. Light to medium at best. * Honestly if you're looking for a foundation to take a chance on.. this is definitely it. I'm not sure why I even chose to buy this but I love it!! I use it over concealer and it evens out my skin tone perfectly. Also does not make me look too orangey or cakey. * Just meh"

It was so easy to apply, felt nice on my skin, looks natural and I think m10 is my shade - it is spot on (for my beautiful summer complexion ) I'm excited to have found Mented! not a con for me, because i don't choose a makeup to smell good, but definitely seems like fragrance wasn't added.

I have pretty dry sky so I know to add a moisturizer before applying this. I am not saying this drying…but makeup ondry skin can appear patchy * This product feels and looks like you have no product on. * I have searched for the perfect match years! So excited to have finally found a shade so spot on with my skin tone that it's almost scary. The stick foundation is easy to apply, blends well and leaves me a great natural glow. * Looked awful on me. Horrible on oily skin and def dont get if you have light skin. This foundation isnt made for light skin tones which sucks. * Perfect match almost feels like a tinted moisturizer. I'm oily so I still need a powder but for stick makeup it goes on smooth and doesn't run off. I'm sold * Okay so hear me out.. the color match to my skin is amazing!!! it blended beautifully. However, I have combo oily skin and nothing could have prepared me for how shiny and oily this foundation is. This is not a matte foundation so beware!! * Hidden Gem hands down. I have been looking for a good foundation in general for a few years now, I went high end low end drugstore I went tinted moisturizer to full coverage and non did what I actually wanted. I love make up but finding a good foundation for my oily skin that wont force me to re touch (which I'm horrible at by the way, always makes it worse) was close to impossible without making me feel like I have pounds of make up on especially for work. I had tried the Hourglass foundation stick which was highly rated and felt very chalky on my skin. I did a search of stick foundations and came across this one. I am the lightest shade in this line and am on my way to re up for a 3rd time! I have never purchased 1 item more than once since they end up not working out for a while. The coverage is amazing from one layer to a 2 layers if I want a fuller look. It glides on like butter on my skin  and gives me a glow without an oily look if that makes sense. I rarely have to completely set my face because it sets so nice on its own and will literally last me over 9 hours without any cracks or separation and looks like I just applied it minutes ago. It makes my face feel hydrated and not like I'm wearing loads of make up. This is a long review and I never leave a review but I am truly in love with this foundation! I am so thankful for this brand because I am the in between when it comes to make up, I'm a semy fare complexion with neutral undertones. Many lines have a Yellow undertone or an olive undertone which makes me look washed out. This is truly a bang for your buck and will leave your make up looking flawless."

185,mac,studio radiance face and body radiant sheer foundation,pimprod2023387,2579193," * wow. I can go on about this foundation forever. I have very pale, dry skin, this shade range cancels out any issues ive had with light foundations that are too orange, does not stick to or emphasize when i have dryness. I 100% recommend this product. * This doesn't settle in wrinkles like a lot of foundation.  It is a bit hard to use to start with but once you figure it out it's very nice.  Good for older and younger skin.  I'm 64 and it's the best I've ever used. * This foundation is perfect for evening out skin tone without making it look like you painted your make up on. I really love pairing it with cream contour and cream blush, and then just setting it with a setting spray- it gives a gorgeous dewy finish. You can set it with powder to make it a little more long lasting too. I always try to catch it on sale. I think having a gorgeous light coverage foundation like this is perfect for an interview, meeting someone new, or embracing your natural beauty! Its made me feel so much more confident in my own skin. * The origin to my villain story. I listened to an ULTA employee, first foundation for my high school homecoming. Three days later I broke out, having clear skin all my life. Ever since, it never stopped. I had to go on meds to cure my acne. Don't use. * I used to use the old face and body without the radiance and always loved it so im not surprised I love the new version especially because I like more of a sheen/glow to my skin. This is a very sheer coverage foundation but is buildable if you want a little more coverage. Also I can apply this over my skincare without it pilling! * I never tried the original face and body. Honestly, I was never interested in this foundation until I started watching Miss Megan Robinson on tik tok. Seriously you NEED to follow her!! I generally have oily skin. It's been a lot more calm, and a lot less oily after I got rid of all the actives, and JUST started washing, toning, and using AN OIL (I know right, but it's true, oil loves oil, using an oil will keep your skin from producing a lot of oil) I can now wear this foundation confidently, and it is BEAUTIFUL!! It's friction activated so I suggest applying with fingers and rubbing it in so you can start to feel the ""gripping and thickening"" action that happens with this foundation(which is the best most fun part for me). The coverage is obviously light but it looks like perfected skin. Only the best things are peeking through. Everything blends nicely on top, and I mean EVERYTHING, from all different brands. It wears great too and looks even better as the day goes on. Its softly radiant and skin like if you powder (which I still do) and if you don't you'll look like a freshly hot glazed donut (some people like that, some people don't) I get the hype of this foundation and dare I say it's made it into my top 5 line up!!?? Coming from an oily girl that is shocking. If you're wondering, I use the Danessa Myricks yummy skin balm in translucent as a primer, this foundation, all my other creams and liquids, and I set with Mac studio fix powder and one size setting spray. PERFECTED NATURAL RADIANT SKIN * Wear it everyday and have received unprovoked complements."
186,vdl,perfect lasting foundation,pimprod2006000,2560248," * I LOVE this foundation! It's definitely full coverage. It look so beautiful like natural skin! It doesn't dry matte, so definitely set it with powder. I'd say a little goes a long way! It last all day & still look beautiful even after a workout. The only areas that would slightly crease would be around my smile lines & chin but nothing crazy. I wish the foundation would be more available but it's so hard to find & the shade range isn't the best but overall 10/10 I would recommend! My closest shade is A05.5. I also tried mixing V05 & V04 to get my shade if anyone is wondering. I hope this helps.  :) * Coming from an Ulta Employee, after trying every foundation under the sun, this foundation makes my skin look FLAWLESS, airbrushed, smooth. I do have to set with a translucent loose powder because it is still a little tacky in my opinion. Shades are FANTASTIC. A02 matches me the closest; however if there was a slightly paler shade with a yellow undertone that would be my perfect match. I ordered A01 and A02 on YesStyle and to me 1 was almost darker than 2, but it may just be the undertones. ULTA PLEASE BRING THIS BACK. It took me over a week with express shipping on YS btw I paid $19 extra FYI In case anyone was going to order it, I think it ships from China. Idk what is in this foundation but  I want to buy every bottle just incase it ever gets discontinued😅😭😭😭 * My relationship with foundation is a nightmare,I'm a brown skin girl with golden undertones in the summer and pale skin in the winter,without much prep this foundation matched me perfectly and stayed on ALL NIGHT,the a night of dancing 💕LOVE THIS STUFF * Please restock ASAP! This is my favorite foundation!! I literally bought 3 bottles because I have a feeling Ulta might discontinue this foundation...
 FYI- you can still find VDL on Yesstyle BUT it's NOT the same foundation. The one on Yesstyle has SPF & it has more of a dewy finish 😩 * I hope Ulta is not going to stop selling this foundation. It is an amazing satin finish foundation. Looks flawless on the skin and makes blemished skin look smooth. Wears beautifully throughout the day and is full coverage. Highly recommend. FYI if they stop selling it at Ulta you can find it on YesStyle. * I bought this foundation in the color A06. I tend to have a hard time finding foundations because I am in the weird shade range where I'm typically between medium/tan and dark/deep in various brands. I have Neutral slightly golden/olive undertones and find that many brands get close but not perfectly my shade. Most times foundations are too golden (almost orange looking), too cool, exactly neutral when I need just a touch of yellow in the foundation, or they just skip my shade altogether. I was pleasantly surprised when this foundation was an exact match. I love the natural finish to this foundation. I have dehydrated combo skin that if not properly hydrated will get oily in the t-zone (mostly nose area) and will remain normal or slightly dry everywhere else. When I wear this for several hours my foundation goes from very natural to radiant but not oily as my t-zone starts to break into a bit of a shine. I really don't have anything bad to say about this foundation except because of the limited shade range there's a chance you may not find a good match depending on your skin tone and undertone. Hopefully Ulta continues to keep this foundation available. * I would describe this foundation on my skin as full coverage with a satin/slight dewy finish. I have acne prone skin with acne scars and this foundation covers everything without causing any texture. Long wearing and mask proof. Doesn't cause breakouts. Would recommend for various skin types."
187,l'orÃ©al,age perfect creamy powder foundation,pimprod2021675,2569747," * Very light, silky powder texture. The ""creamy"" title is very deceiving though. It's powder. And quite drying immediately on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this for aging skin whatsoever. Great product for on the go touch ups on oily skin. * I don't care for the sponge applicator because it really doesn't go on right, but I found that using a brush to apply is so much better and it goes on more evenly.  You can add more where needed without it looking blotchy.  I love it! Used the color Sienna * Goes smooth and cover some imperfections, but looks natural. Leaves your skin soft and beautiful. * Lightest shade, Ivory.  You MUST prep the skin with moisturizer, sunscreen and either CT Hollywood Flawless Filter or the Maybeline knockoff or a dewy primer or sunscreen.  Buff in with a brush after applying concealer where needed.  Use powder bronzer, blush and highlight and a setting spray.  It looked amazing on my 48 year old dry skin and lasted all day.  Not powdery, didn't settle in lines, let's your skin peek through (is light coverage).   I really love it. * I thought since it's called age perfect it would be a moisturizing creamy powder. Nope. It's super drying and I have combination oily skin not even dry. Feels horrible right on application You can feel the makeup. Didn't blur anything. I had to take it off within 10 mins of application. Don't buy this stuff. * I wanted to try a cream to powder foundation to try to cover some dark spots. 
This covered what I wanted. It does look a little dry after application but I'm oily so it looks more natural after a few hours. * I love the age rewind concealer and seen this after looking for a good powder foundation. it is a really creamy, finely milled powder. I don't think it's really pigmented but you get enough coverage to even everything out and in my opinion it really does blur. I use a flat top Kabuki brush to buff it in, slowly building up layers. I take product and tap it in where I need more coverage with a concealer brush. I find I get the most coverage this way. it's like your skin but better. gives you a nice natural finish and doesn't look cakey if you slowly buff and build. will be trying this as a setting powder for liquid since it blurs. it also doesn't make me breakout!"
188,hynt beauty,encore pressed powder foundation,pimprod2014352,2564466," * I was so excited to try this powder because of all of the positive reviews. Unfortunately, This product didn't work for my dry skin. And for the price I doesn't have great coverage. I don't see this product any different from any other pressed powder. Also, this powder has sparkles in it I guess to conceal how drying and powdery it makes the skin.. * I love this powder, my skin is dry but this powder always feels comfortable on, never adds any texture as other powders have for me in the past, def one of my fav powders * I LOVE this pressed powder! It takes away the look of shine and makes my skin look refined and even toned. I bought Ivory and it is the ideal shade for my skin tone, medium fair with pink undertones. It works well worn over concealer and foundation, or on its own. And, better still, it looks invisible and feels like nothing on skin! The mirrored compact is the perfect size for taking on the go and it even comes with an applicator sponge on a clear, hinged divider inside. Hynt thought of everything with this pressed powder! I will definitely buy again:) * I've always been reluctant to wear powder - most of the time I end up looking cake-y. This finishing powder is a game changer - so easy to apply and bonus, the packaging is so adorable! But more importantly my skin looks so velvety and super plump, definitely will be coming back for more when I'm through with this! * Love using this powder in-between zoom meetings to touch up my skin. Just gives me a more even/finished and natural look * One of my favorite products from Hynt * I used this foundation with the foam puff it came packaged with. Do not use with a brush, the powder is finely milled and will fall off your brush! I wore it over serum and moisturizer. My face got a little shiny throughout the day but that is common for me, as I have combination skin. I like that the coverage is buildable, I was able to apply two layers and achieved the coverage I was looking for. Best of all, the ingredients are natural and truly clean! No SLS, no parabens, no Lauryl Lysine, no Bismuth oxychloride! So happy Ulta is carrying this brand!"
189,hourglass,vanish seamless finish liquid foundation,pimprod2020422,2575785," * For a pro makeup artist, ( yes, you need to be a pro to know how to work with it) this is so far one of the best foundations that I have ever worked with. I recommend performing a gentle face exfolation before bed time and removing any peach fuzz for any makeup aplication, not just this foundation. It makes a huge difference in aplication and appearance of the final look/finish.
It works best with the Vanish smoothing primer. (To smooth down the pores that every human being has) It is runny but extreamly pigmented. Do not use too much or it will look cakey.Best apply with a dense buffer brush (Morphe 444 is my favorite) and then press it in with a beauty blender. I use the professional Kryolan setting spray first, and then set it with a good powder.( Jeffree Star, Fenty or Kryolan powder) It holds for 14h even in humid Florida. Best foundation for events. It's best for normal/ combination skin. I wish they had more shades.
Unfortunately it just has been discontinued, tho the company has gave me insites that they are working on perfecting the formula and making a new foundation for combination/oily skin (they currently carry luminous foundations for normal/dry skin) * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * This product is so thin & runny! Like water consistency. I pumped one pump on my hand & it literally dripped off me. I shook the bottle so many times & it still remained runny. I gave it a try on my face because I wanted to give the foundation a chance but the product just settled right into any crevice it could. I could literally see wrinkles/lines I didn't even know I had. * I got this during a sale and was so excited to try my first Hourglass product. I followed the instructions and reviews and only used a very little amount. It brings out my pores horribly, dries down very weird and makes my skin dry, and even though it feels light on my skin my skin feels a tiny bit sticky, not something I usually experience with prestige brand foundations. This is a miss for me. * This foundation is very reminiscent of Marc Jacob's 'Remarcable' . Full coverage and matte with a pore filling matte primer underneath . The bad reviews are really just people who don't know how to apply makeup . * Words do not explain how buttery this foundation is I have dry to normal skin and it blends it two to three glides. Will never use another foundation"
190,smashbox,studio skin 24 hour full coverage waterproof foundation,pimprod2009758,2552423," * Luckily I night this on a good sale a ways back but it is just not it. I have combo oily skin and so far regardless of the primer or moisturizer this just doesn't look good and will break down. I've been using juvias place which I like ten times better and I don't have to try to make it work. This foundation also oxidizes orange..so not just a shade but it'll turn more orange as well. I'm gonna try to find something to mjx it with but I won't be purchasing again and wouldn't recommend it. * I have oily combo skin, and this foundation did not stand the test of time. It felt very heavy, and transferred with the slightest touch (with setting powder). Only a few hours in, and it was breaking apart on my face, highlighting even the slightest texture. My pores were literally drinking this product up. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a foundation, and could not wait to take it off. * I have combo skin, I use the Bobby brown moisturizer primer underneath and only use a tiny bit with a brush. Looks flawless!! Do not use to much product otherwise it will look cakey, if you need extra coverage apply only to specific area with smaller brush. * 32f (no active breakout/indented scars only on cheeks/combination skin)This foundation has the worst formula I have ever used on my skin. I tried two different primers underneath and tried it on it's own and it just refused to settle or smooth out. It creases badly and makes skin look dry and caked with very minimal use of the product that looked worse and worse if you tried to use even a tiny bit more. Powders and setting spray do nothing to help. I tried beauty blenders and brushes and neither made it better. I ended up going back to a trusty Revlon foundation that was way cheaper and a much better formula. Do not waste your money if you do not have perfect smooth skin. * I have sensitive skin with large amounts of rosacea and occasional eczema. This product covers my redness very well, and can many my dry areas seemingly disappear. Smashbox was also a line that came up multiple times during my search for products best for sensitive skin. * Maybe this just doesn't work with some skin types. I've given this several goes with different amounts of product and application techniques and it always manages to cake up and accentuate every pore after it's settled. I decided to give this one more go, applying after a glowy moisturizer that managed to save some of my other cakey products and it still had the same issues after setting for about 20 minutes. * It has perfect coverage,  a very little goes a long way.  Love the Matt finish I got.  Like  all foundations,  you have to prepare your skin before you applying anything to it.  Use a brush to apply.  I patted it on."
