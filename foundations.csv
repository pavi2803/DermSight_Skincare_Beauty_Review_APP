1,urban decay,face bond self-setting waterproof foundation,pimprod2044818,2623593," * That is a very, very good product. Keep it on the shelf. * This is what replaced their old naked skin weightless foundation and it doesnt even compare. I love they kept the matte finish but this one definitely makes my skin not look as flawless. Almost splotchy in places. Bring back the old one! It was my absolute favorite!!! * I have realllyyy oily skin.  NOTHING lasts and always seems to crease or seperate around my nose, chin, and forehead.  I bought this when it was on sale because I figured it was worth a try for the price and after a month of use its safe to say that so far nothing has compared for me.  I currently have it on and after 11 hours + work for 7 it still looks BEAUTIFUL.  I'd recommend to anyone that has oily skin, it might not be the best for dry skin though but I've never noticed any clinging to dry patches with this one either * My fav skin tint! * I absolutely LOVE this foundation! Its buildable, and a little goes a long way! I love a natural/matte look, so i really enjoy how this looks on my skin. I have acne and scarring, as well as redness. It doesnt feel heavy, and it lasts me over 12 hours along with my skin prep. * Eh, it's alright. I have fair and neutral skin. But it's also dry, so I have to work quick with this foundation or it will start pulling apart as I work with it. It also settles into my pores after some time if the layer is too thick. And while it's a decent shade match, it tends to pull yellow on me * I had only used this a handful of times & its a complete waste of money, it exploded and there's practically nothing left."

3,dior,dior forever fluid skin glow foundation,pimprod2036824,2605019," * I wanted to try this a few times before giving my final thoughts. Im a healthcare worker who regularly works 12 hour shifts. That being said, I have tried & tested SO many foundations this year. My issue with other foundations is the fact that it doesnt last through a shift. I was always dealing with creasing, patching, flaking and just looking cakey. I tried different skin prep, primers, setting powders/ sprays and nothing changed. Ive been wanting to try this foundation now for a while and finally did.. and let me tell you- this is the best purchase ive ever made. It holds up beautifully, and it still looks just as amazing at the end of the day. Every issue ive had with other foundations, never happened with this. 
I have very sensitive & acne prone skin and this has not given me any sort of reaction or break out. My first shift wearing it, i received so many compliments. It gave me my confidence back! I will continue to repurchase this. * I dont have sensitive skin. I never broke out from a cosmetic product and this immediately caused the worst reaction on my face. My skin was dry itch and peeling. This foundation has a fragrance in it and it is not good for the skin. Sucks because i really liked the product. * I bought this for my mom. She loved it so much that I had to buy one for myself. The coverage is outstanding. We have been using it for a bit now, this is her 4th bottle and my 1st. Will definitely buy again! * This foundation leaves a beautiful dewy finish in my over 50 skin!! * Dior doesn't disappoint.  Even better layered. Do the coverage that works for you.  Lasts all day perfectly. * Too expensive. I wear it everyday. * Received my order today from Ulta, and it's already expired. Will buy directly from Dior from now on. Do better, Ulta."

5,lancÃ´me,teint idole ultra wear 24h full coverage foundation,pimprod2039028,2608119," * Definitely would be buying it again * Good for my skin, non-comedogenic, non-acneogenic, and it looks natural on. It's also buildable if you need a little more. Thanks, Lancome. * Best foundation I can find to stay on my oily T-zone with a little help from hourglass mineral primer . Not happy that they reformulated and took away my 215-N which was a perfect match for my complexion. * I have neutral-y, extremely pale, olive undertone skin. I have struggled my whole life with foundations. Warm tones are always orange, cool tones are pink, and neutral tends to lean a bit coral-colored. 095w is the first shade match ive ever gotten that didnt need contour to make work. It doesnt feel heavy on my skin and it never looks cakey. * I loved how the foundation applied abd looked on my skin, it's probably the best I've seen on myself, ut they need to make better light - fair skin shades. Even the lightest shade (which is neutral) is yellow on me, and the lightest cool tone shade is too dark. * My previous color had too much red in it which made my face to dark Against my light colored neck. I'm looking forward to using it. And make up artist put the color on my face before I bought it and I loved it. I'm sure I will enjoy it compared to the previous color I had. * I had been wearing Dior Forever Matte for over 4 years now but started to notice it wasn't blending well on my skin no matter how I applied it.  Decided to try Lancolm Teint Idole Ultra Wear Matte and am loving it.  It is more liquidy than the Dior which makes it much easier to apply & blend.  I literally only need 1 pump worked into my brush using the palm of my hand (a Wayne Goss tip) for my whole face.  I set it with a little Morphe powder and a puff.  It looks grest ALL day and matches my fair yellow-gold undertone perfectly.   I usually blot twice a day and the excess oil is easily removed while the foundation looks newly applied again.  No extra powder needed.  So glad I decided to switch to Lancolm!   Would highly recommend!!!"

8,nars,light reflecting advanced skincare foundation,pimprod2030141,2591117," * They were out of my normal foundation from nars. It has good coverage but it runny when you put it on and doesnt have the same luster as radiant wear foundation. Its ok for a change but wouldn't purchase again. * I used the foundation finder tool on NARS' website and it recommended the shade Patagonia.  It was a perfect match!  I apply it with a brush and use 2 tiny pumps of foundation and it covers everything - blemishes, dark circles, etc.  Does not look like I am wearing foundation which is the key. * I love this foundation so much, its goes on so smoothly, it blends well and its oily friendly. I have my summer and my winter shades. * I've been using NARS foundation for a few years and love everything about it. I had been using  Armani foundation and due to prices increases I tried NARS and never went back. NARS is comparable to Armani and more affordable. * It's pretty good but I don't think it's a product I would purchase again. There are other foundations that are equal to this one that aren't as expensive. I have dry skin and it works pretty well with it, however the overall feel of wearing it kinda bugs me. It feels like it sits on top of your skin rather than soaking into it. Also, please, for the love of everything, fix the pump and the cap. The pump shoots out the foundation, and the cap stopped connecting onto the bottle after some time. Gets quite messy. 

It does have a glowy, dewy finish and decent coverage, which is what I was looking for, so that's a plus. * I purchased this foundation because it had been recommended to me by multiple people as being ""safe for acne prone skin"". I am in my early 20s and have been on the hunt for a foundation that looks good and doesn't break me out. Unfortunately, it's not this one. Each time I used it my face flared up with more pimples. I wash my brushes after each use, and do thorough skin care prep to try to prevent a breakout as much as possible. I've worn this foundation many times because I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt, but I've been left with horrific pimples that I am trying to get rid of months later. The makeup does look amazing on the skin and it does have that very light Dewey look to it and covers acne very well, but the after effects are not worth it. I have deep painful pimples on my face now. * This is the best liquid foundation i have ever used! Genuinely sooooo worth the price. My skin looks so fresh and clean when i use this foundation. I like how it is buildable yet light weight. Just a must!!!"

It's greasy, cakey and settles in every line and pore on my face. It is so bad, it's nothing like the original formula. After about 3 hours of wearing it, I couldn't handle how bad it looked and how greasy and cakey it got. Never wearing this again! * I have super oily skin and sometimes my makeup just doesn't last. However, I wore this for my wedding in August and it wore so beautifully. Even by the end of the night I still had coverage! Got so many compliments on my makeup. It's my go-to now! * Omg so i dont really use matte foundations because unfortunately i have very dry skin but something cool I discovered playing with make up is use a tinted moisturizer foundation with this foundation and you girlies dont know how beautiful this looks 😍 * I tried to love it but I just dont. I used a primer, and have dry ish skin. Not terribly dry, no dry patches. This did not look good at all on my skin. It broke apart and made my skin look much much worse than it did without makeup. I used a brush to apply and it just looked like I threw it on but I took my time to do it. Looked terrible 😂 * I love my makeup"

I skin prepped and moisturized before using this and it looked awful. I ended up using some drug store bought foundation I had instead so I will be returning this item. * I wanted to love this foundatiin given all the great reviews but even after moisturizing masks and serums, this goes on so cakey. I don't have especially dry skin, but this doesnt work for me at all. At my cheekbones and beside my nose, it gets flaky unlike any foundation I've ever used. I do not recommend. * This foundation is amazing! It goes on smooth, looks natural. No cakey buildup, not flaking. Truly feels like a second skin!! From now in my go to!! * It has a really good coverage * It work great on my face covers dark spots.."

Love love love this CC foundation! Not too heavy but great coverage with a nice natural glow to it! Also great that it has SPF to protect my fair skin! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This was a great product, and not just because i received for free! I love the fact that is mostly a skincare foundation versus a regular foundation! The color matched me well, and it provided the right amount of coverage I like! It is lightweight and more of like a skintint to me! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] The first thing I like about this product is the combination of sunscreen, serum, and foundation , saving me time on my busy mornings. Next, the main function of this foundation is its smooth, creamy texture that blends easily to the skin. It provides moderate yet lightweight coverage, leaving the skin feeling smooth, radiant, and healthy-looking, perfectly suited to my natural makeup style. The color matches my skin tone; this depends on individual skin tone selection, but for me, the product has good color payoff and doesn't fade after a few hours. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I've gotten to like my natural face, and this skin tint was sheer enough it didn't feel or look caked on. Love that it also gives SPF 40 protection for my face! The color match was pretty close, too! * I received this product in exchange for my honest review.
[I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I have been using IT Cosmetics CC+ Nude Glow in Fair and this one amazing product does 3 things amazingly well! It's a color correcting, medium-coverage skin tint that incudes a brightening skin serum and SPF 40. The CC+ Nude Glow has a 90% skincare base, made up of 2% niacinamide, hyaluronic acid and green tea extract, so my skin has literally been glowing! It provides medium coverage, yet feels so lightweight and comfortable, it's like  wearing nothing. As a person with a fair complexion, a lot of colors are too orange or dark, but this color just melted into my skin. And, it does all this while providing your SPF. I truly think this is a miracle product! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] A light lotion like foundation that blends in easily and hides fine lines. I tried it in Fall sunshine and the SPF provided good coverage. I'd buy it again. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] This looks amazing on my skin! I got just one shade too dark but this will be perfect for the summer for me!! It's super lightweight, it almost feels like a light cream!"
15,estee lauder,futurist hydra rescue moisturizing foundation spf 45,pimprod2013152,2577966," * Love this foundation. Very smooth and lightweight full coverage. * Was excited to get my hands on this since it was on sale. Tried it in store, and it was cakey. But I was crossing finger it was probably the tester so I still bought it. Next day, I prepped my skin, dried all the products applied and got a brush to put in on. Sadly, it was confirmed cakey on me. 🥲 * I was super hesitant to buy since its a moisturizing foundation nc most dont sit well on my oily t-zone! Ive used the double wear and LOVE the longevity of it, but needed something a little less coverage! This was PERFECT and everyrhing I was looking for. Medium coverage, sits flawlessly on my mature skin, and doesnt over hydrate my already oily skin. Finished with a setting powder and ny skin was flawless ALL day. New favorite and staple in my routine!!!! * This foundation is a life changer. When I wear it my skin looks flawless. People tell me how beautiful my skin is. * Very good product.  I am satisfied and staff very knowledgeable about this product. * This foundation is very moisturizing, which is what my skin needs now that I have more mature skin. I recommend this to anyone who needs moisture. * Was not hydrating in my opinion.  Left a dry look finish, had to shake tube well....returned"

It provides good coverage, it's lightweight, it lasts all day, and it's great for problems skin! * Best foundation I've ever used, I will never buy anything else!!! * I use it to cover my mild melasma and I love it doesn't cake like other products, it feels light and not greasy. * How can you send me used and durty product , i paid my money to receive good quality service but now i will return everything and close my credit card * Color was too dark. * Was recommended this and loved it!"
18,it cosmetics,cc+ cream natural matte foundation with spf 40,pimprod2044261,2621797," * For context, I have dry, sensitive skin with occasional breakouts. For years, it was the best foundation I used, until learning it permanently stained my towels and clothes. Initially, I thought the marks were from bleach, but later saw it was this foundation. This was a deal breaker; I cannot apply a formula to my skin that bleaches fabric. Frankly, I would give it five stars but cannot due this con. Pros: buildable coverage, natural matte— ""skin like"" finish, and excellent shade range. * I LOVE IT makeup. I literally use just about every other product. I have always used the regular CC cream foundation with the 50spf which always looked flawless on my skin. My skin is really combination but because it's more on the oily side and blot oil throughout the day, I figured I'd try the matte. Big mistake. I wish I could return it because it's awful. I have big pores especially on my nose and this makeup just sits in the pores almost like reverse freckles! And when trying to blend it into my skin, it smears and is cakey and just no. I'm going back to the normal CC line because that one melts into my skin. I do not recommend this at all. * I really like this foundation it is light weight and long lasting throughout the day. It takes very little and the coverage is great. * Didn't get my free gift * Tried this on a whim during the big 50% off sale. it is my new favorite foundation!! I love the way it looks, blends, the coverage, etc. my new staple for daily wear. * This has been my go-to CC cream for years (maybe a decade?) but with my most recent purchase in August 2025, i was disappointed to discover the formulation has completely changed. It is no longer a mineral based (zinc, titanium) sunscreen. And the coverage is way thicker. Reminds me dermablend heaviness. So frustrated by the change because it was so incredible for so long. Back to the drawing board. * Good coverage, moisturizes your skin and you don't need much product."

As I age I find myself gravitating more towards a skin tint versus a medium/full coverage foundation. My skin needs a product that's less drying and more hydrating. Fenty Beauty blurring skin tint made it to my top two! This skin tint plays well with all my skincare products and all my other makeup products. The wear time is great and it doesn't cake after hours of wearing it. I mean, what else could you ask for? This is around $40 which is step but I'm willing to spend that for a product that's works so well for my routine!

@influenster @fentybeauty * Maybe not for my skin cause i have dry and oily. It creases badly with powder and spray after 2 hours * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I received the Fenty Skin Tint for free, and I was actually surprised by how much I ended up liking it. The texture is lightweight and blends really easily without looking streaky or cakey. It evens out my skin tone while still letting my natural skin show through, so it doesn't look like I'm wearing a full foundation.

The finish is natural with a slight blurring effect, and it feels comfortable throughout the day—no heaviness, no chalky dryness, and it didn't cling to dry patches. I also noticed it doesn't oxidize as much as other tints I've tried.

It's not full coverage, so if you have blemishes or dark spots you'll still need a concealer, and it can get a little dewy after a few hours if you have oilier skin. But overall, it's a great everyday product for a smooth, quick, effortless look. * It's the oddest thing, but this skin tint was truthfully the worst thing I've put on my face in a loooooong time. I don't know what it is. It just does NOT like my skin. I've tried applying with my fingers and massaging into my skin. I've tried applying with my fingers and blending out with a sponge. I've tried no primer underneath. I've tried primer underneath. I've tried my usual skincare underneath. I've tried without any skincare at all. I can NOT get this skin tint to stop collecting in ever single pore on my face to the point where it looks like little tiny dots all over and a sheer wash of nothing in between. I've even tried building it up thinking I needed more. Conversely, I've tried using the least amount possible thinking I was using too much. It also seems to find and desperately cling to the slightest whisper of dryness that I swear I didn't have before I put it on and make me look like a crusty sandwich. I ended up returning it because I couldn't salvage this disaster. It also broke up crazily in every crease I own within an hour… with setting powder, without setting powder, with concealer (Fenty btw), without concealer. Didn't matter. * I love this product and would buy it again. * I wanted to love this so bad but after 4/5 hours it either fades or slides around. You're better off wearing concealer or the elf cc cream."

23,morphe,lightform extended hydration foundation,pimprod2043869,2621355," * I really love this foundation is super light on the skin but performs well . Medium to buildable coverage . Definitely would by again and possibly add a few shades to my kit. Please keep around * The old formula was so much better.  This one is fine.  The packaging is horrible.  The bottle leaks all the time and pumping it out is terrible.  It's like there is no spring in the pump.  Its a hard press and you cant really manage how much comes out. Then a drip leaks out after you press it, which is wasteful.  I like the foundation ok, but they desperately need to fix the bottle and pump. * Love the color & goes on so smooth. * Even though its light coverage, it makes your skin look amazing, with glow and sooo natural. * Very easy to use! I literally just used a foundation brush and applied it and it was seamless with no oxidation or cracking. This is coming from someone who has never used foundation before because of how i worried id look a mess later lol. Morphe has yet to let me down * I got this product as a free gift with purchase. I hadn't even considered trying it until I received it as the free gift. I absolutely love the coverage. This is not something I would have tried before as I have not used Morphe foundations. However, the drawback is foundation comes out of the pump and gets on the finger after pushing down. This  creates a mess and then foundation gets everywhere or you have to have something to wipe off the excess that gets on your finger from the pump leaking. * Love it"
24,tarte,face tape full coverage foundation,pimprod2003933,2540290," * This is the HOLY GRAIL of all foundations; it's true. I'm shocked. I had to change my skincare routine, especially my foundation, after 40yo, due to creasing. This DOES NOT CREASE. Amazing!! It is waterproof, lasts more than 24 hours, & it's as smooth as it gets. I am in love, & this is now my go to foundation for full glam days. I did have trouble with color matching, as the new 20B was far too white/caspery, but the 22B was nearly spot on. 27B was far too orange for me. The whiter colors run especially light ladies; up yourself to a shade darker than you think you'll need & you should be good. :-) * I like the way it looks on me, does not cake and looks natural * I wanted a full coverage foundation & an Ulta beauty rep. recommend this foundation. On a spot check at the store, it looked good. However, when I put it on my whole face at home, I saw wrinkles I had never seen before! This foundation is so think it settled into my fine lines and pores making them look bigger. * Flawless finish. * Foundation in neutral is very orange
Love the coverage but color choices are hard to match my complexion * This is my go to foundation. I love the coverage, the range of shades and my skin is happy with it on. Pair it with a great primer and top it with a good setting spray and you're golden from morning until night. * Everytime I wear this foundation, I get so many compliments on it."

I used a $60 foundation months back and regret paying that money for horrible foundation. This one has never let me down! * The product goes on very easily and leaves an almost instant matt finish, yet still blend-able even after it starts to dry. I have dry skin and even though it dries down almosy instantly, it doesn't feel like it's making my skin feel even more dry and doesn't cling to any dry patches. It does however get into my smile creases, but i have pretty defined lines so that's expected. * My skin is combo mostly dry and this foundation looks gorgeous on my skin. It does not look cakey throught the day and the longevity is good. Highly recommended for people with dry or combo skin. * Goes on smoothly. Perfect balance for my combination skin. Just the right amount of coverage. Highly recommend! * They need more shades but I like the formula. It really sticks to my skin and lasts an 8 hour shift at work. Doesnt feel too heavy or cakey. * I had high expectations for this skin tint seeing all of its glowing reviews. After only using it twice, my skin HATED IT. I started getting little break outs allllll over my skin. Will be returning. ): * I love it, very flawless on the skin, lasts all day and its natural for a natural looking day"
28,beautycounter,skin twin featherweight foundation,pimprod2038184,2606483," * I truely like the way the foundation glides on and covers. * I had high hopes for this foundation, considering all the positive reviews, but I found it to be subpar. The smell was absolutely terrible, I found the coverage to be uneven, and after an hour or so of wear, I looked in the mirror and it really exaggerated my fine lines and pores. I for sure would not recommend this foundation to anybody over the age of 35. * This is a no for me. It smells terrible and does not work on my skin. Exaggerates dry spots, separates in oily areas, and looks cakey with any amount of product. I've tried applying with fingers, brushes, and sponges. I'm really disappointed I spent so much on it. Drugstore foundations are much better quality than this one! * This is a difficult foundation to work with, the coverage never looks even to me and it's not buildable. up close, I can see it pills on my skin if I pass the sponge over it more than a couple of times. cream products don't layer over it well - it's hard to blend cream blush, bronzer and highlighter on top and it transfers and moves all over the face. It doesn't really set down, even with powder. I have dry skin and never have issues with uneven coverage or getting a foundation to set down, with or without setting powder. I'm just not a fan, I have wet n wild, Catrice, urban decay and Pat McGrath foundations that all perform better across the cost spectrum. * This a wonderful foundation. It gives perfect coverage, making my skin look dewy and fresh.   The best part is that it is a clean product, without the bad stuff.I love this brand. * Not enough coverage for my aging skin! * Unsure. It's not like it's a bad product. I feel it's good quality. I think maybe for a lighter foundation could be a good find. I feel for the price, what my expectations were; not a good buy necessarily. Fell a bit flat for me. I've also only used a couple (2-3) times. Maybe it grows. My skin feels nice.
I don't feel excited afterwords-if that makes sense? Sometimes I put on foundation and I'm like ""OO-Hello there!"" I put this on and feel like…ehh. Best way I can put it. I did have a more positive prospective when adding a glow enhancer. It's ok."

It controls the oil, covers all my unevenness and cystic acne scars. I feel like I have finally found my forever powder foundation. I am 61 years old, and I have spent a lot of money thru the years trying to find something that gave me good coverage and not make me oily. This is it. Hoping that It Cosmetics never changes this powder. * Goes on smooth as a finish. Works well and does not crease. It is my go to! * A light feeling medium coverage foundation that does not enhance deep wrinkles. It is perfect for a natural look. * Love the cc+ plus brand all together! Use all their products for my face & always get compliments. Nice recommendation from the store associate & overall good experience! Will buy again!! * I don't understand why all the negative reviews. first this powder is amazing, it's lightweight but you can apply more for more coverage. I FINALLY FOUND A POWDER THAT COVERS ALL THE REDNESS ON MY CHEEKS! no joke. it doesn't cause my face to look oily, no blotting sheets necessary. it lasts all day. another thing is I appreciate the small pad that comes with the powder just in case you want to reapply in the middle of the day, but the good news is I can leave my powder at home, because it lasts throughout my day. people compliment me & wonder what I am using. I buy another powder and always go back to this one. it doesn't sink into your pores and make them look huge or settle in the creases of your face, it just looks natural not a cakey powder. & no more redness. I do use the liquid foundation on some days and I love it too! can't go wrong with this powder. * I'm not super oily by any means, but this product acts like I'm an oil slick. 
I normally use the lancome pressed powder and it looks dry until alil oil mixes, then it doesn't look like makeup at all.  this powder once you apply it looks great, but after 30 minutes it's slipping and sliding around my face. any little touch to the face and it'll come right off. and don't get me started on the shade range.
so if you have super dry skin, doesn't make any oil at all, you'll be fine. everyone else find a different option. * Light feeling powder, not heavy at all"

My skincare and prep is great and other foundations never do this and I have tried many. * Color is perfect,  doesnt look fake and blends well. * the best foundation ever!!!!! it makes me look like i am wearing nothing and my skin is clear and glowing, a little bit goes a long way, also its a perfect match. * I really like this foundation, it is so pretty!! Lovely!! I like it so much, I bought another bottle just in case  they discontinue this. And the match was perfect! Transfer proof-check, sweat proof, check, and it feels so light on my face. I will be buying this again for sure! * This foundation to so good. I'd put it one par with Estee Lauder Double Wear. Similar but better. Looks like skin. Super light weight and give full coverage. Can't imagine what other didnt like about it. * The best foundation I've used ever. It has a skin like look and blends perfectly. You can also build on top of it really nicely. I use it for stage make up so I put a lot of layers on top and it works very nicely. * I was so let down by this foundation. I thought it would be a good fit for me since its a full coverage foundation that is supposed to feel like a serum. But it ended up looking cakey almost immediately, and 30 mins later it began to separate badly in my nose. It just looked horrible. I've tried changing up my primer, powder, etc and it's still the same. I really wanted to love it since it is full coverage, but at what cost? I cant wear it at all because I work high-end retail sales, and how I present myself at work is important. Super disappointing. I've never had this issue with a foundation before."

If it helps I also work in a hot factory & it stays put! * Love coverage and humectan my skin face. * Lasts all day long for and as someone who struggles with acne and scars it does an amazing job doe coverage. * I bought this as an impulse buy and I think I'll be returning it. I enjoyed the coverage and it doesn't irritate my sensitive, acne-prone skin but I would not recommend UNLESS you have SUPER oily skin. My skin is combination but seems to be more dry with age and the colder months + being in a dryer climate. After applying, my skin felt so tight and dry; I felt like it accentuated my aging skin. The first time I used it, I had a moisturizer AND a BB cream underneath and found it was too drying. The next time I used it, I put Vaseline under it, but it still seemed drying. Maybe applying it with a damp sponge would help in my case? * I have always bought Lancome and they discontinued my color. Not happy with other colors. I know ew lancome makes loreal so tried this and actually like better so far! * First time trying this foundation. The color and coverage is flawless, doesn't crease nor is chalky. This is so similar to Estee Lauder Double Wear Found. Perfect doupe!! * Really enjoying this foundation, the application, shade, and lasting power is great. By far my favorite foundation"

Would love to try a glowy version! * I have been using this foundation for years.
Works well for sensitive acne prone skin. * Please bring back the old formula. Im so sad this formula got changed. My perfect shade also got discontinued. I wish bare minerals would have just made a bew foundation rather then changing. * They change the pump & bottle. Don't like it less make up comes out with each pump. Have to use two pumps used to only have to use one . They also stopped making my color. I hate when they change things that work for me. It's like don't fix it if it's not broken! * I feel so deceived and robbed by ulta. In August; They sold me my usual bareMinerals bare pro in fair 10 warm that I've purchased many times before. There was no notice of any change in the colors. It was still called fair 10 warm. I ordered what I always have to have on hand when my other one ran out. Well it just ran out and I went to use the one I purchased in August to discover that it's an entirely different color now and way too dark on me. I went to ulta in person to get help and the woman at the register confirmed that yes bareMinerals changed their shades….. but kept all the old names, which is incredibly misleading. Ulta refuses to help me exchange it for a product that IS my shade because it's been more than 60 days since my purchase. I feel deceived and robbed and ulta refuses to help. Will not be shopping ulta again. They devieve you, take your money, and then disrespect you over email (Maria, I'm talking about you) and blatantly refuse yo help. Never giving ulta another penny and will be sharing my story all over. * Even though I have brought this product for several years, I would go and try something new that's supposed to be even better and I always come back to this one. * Love Bare Minerals & finally picked the perfect match to my skin tone"
35,polite society,more than a pretty face skin-caring foundation,pimprod2040619,2615174," * I noticed i had to oump several times to get some prodcut. I thought it was just the applicator. Nope. Barely used 5 times and no product. Plus…. Eas to heavy and didnt blend with my other products. * so I bought this on Black Friday trying it on now so far it feels pretty good 
I think I will buy again * This is a great foundation, is long lasting for my oily leaning skin and the color matche is perfect. I'm very light neutral and I always have a hard time finding a foundation match since I'm between fair and light. The only problem is after three months of use the pump broke I'm I'm having to unscrew it and use the pump stick to get the foundation out, but it is very messy. I contacted polite society but they said they couldn't do anything since I bought it from Ulta and I need to return it to Ulta, but it's past the return time. it's a great foundation, but the pump breaking is disappointing and I've seen other reviewers have the same issue. * My skin gets very oily no matter what I do often, even with some primers and powders, the only foundation that have hold me and never let me down is EsteLauder double wear. Anyways I saw this one because so many people have talk about it, the shade match is on point and is very light on the skin. So far have been great and doesn't goes oily fast, stay in place and still look flawless all day, after couple of hours can get a little oily but with powder it looks like I just get my makeup done. Is very good and little goes a long way. No complaints about it, works great and keeps me matte when use with huda powder. * So I have been wanting to order this for a long time and was extremely excited when it was on sale was, expecting born this way quality. It is not.
While it's not a bad foundation, it does seem to settle into pores and Fine lines. Probably would not purchase again. And really really hate the bottle in the lid. It is the most ridiculous contraction crap. * Let'a start first with packaging. I saw a lot of comments about leakage of the foundation. I haven't experienced it yet however, the pump is so poorly done. It dispense so little product with each pump. So bad. Also it feels like whatever bottle I got was old or something because the product looks and feels dry. 
Then, the product consistency, if you have dry skin, DO NOT PURCHASE. I have combination skin and it works on some areas and others don't. So it is not ""instant hydration"" as they claim it is. 
I didn't love the finish, it's like ok. * I ordered this in very light cool and it looks VERY orange on me. I would stay away from this if your skin is cool toned. That being said, the formula is one of the best medium coverage buildable foundarions ive ever tried, so if they have a shade for you, definitley worth getting. Its light feeling with a true medium coverage and wears amazing, almost no breakdown even after a long day wearinf it"

What a shame because its much better for the environment to just buy refill pans after getting the full component.  Its also meant to be a great way to keep the product affordable!    Go check out the ND website or beautylish for refill purchasing. * Very good product I will buy again. * This powder foundation lives up to the hype. Great coverage that is buildable and wears well, even with my oily complexion. The Ulta associate really helped me find the best color match, as there are many shades available for this foundation. * I absolutely love this powder. I struggle with getting the right coverage for my skin type (sensitive, rosacea) with liquid foundation. I prefer a more natural look and this made me look airbrushed as well! * I bought this powder foundation after reading reviews and wish I had bought it sooner! Good coverage and doesn't settle into my pores or wrinkles like other products I've tried. Doesn't oxidize or turn orangey after a few hours of wear and last well throughout the day. This is my new go to for day to day use! * Very impressed with Natasha D makeup. Everything that I have bought I have ended up keeping from concealer, eyeshadow, lipstick and now this powder foundation. I actually use it as a finishing powder and touch ups. My routine includes starting with the IT Cosmetics CC cream and top off with this powder- you can keep layering and your skin will look beautiful!! I top off with bronzer or blush if I feel like it. The best thing is that the shades provide a natural flesh like color. * Powder foundation is just not good for nature skin .... goes in every line under my eyes"

What once was a beautiful skin tint is now an extremely runny and greasy mess. I absolutely hate it and returned it immediately. * I purchased a new bottle on 10/30 since I ran out.  I've been using this product for a long time.  Not happy with what looks like its been watered down.  Not as rich as it was.  Before I can even apply it correctly it absorbs into the spnge.  Not happy! * It is a nice coverage, not too light or too heavy, but definitely not sweat proof! That's the only reason I gave 4/5 stars. * I was so sad about this skin tint. I prepped with two different moisturizers and made sure my skin was nice and hydrated before applying. I typically have fairly oily combo skin, but this dried me out terribly, enhanced all my texture and fine lines. After a few hours it got patchy and it just made me look so old. How do people love this so much? I'm convinced its meant solely for 20-somethings with perfect skin. Plus, the fact that L'Oreal, the largest beauty, couldnt put a wiper in the bottle to make it less messy. This is getting returned. * I use an SPF serum under my foundation unless the foundation doubles as an SPF as well. I wanted to try this product without the SPF serum just to test how hydrating it is as a standalone.  While this product offers a nice ""light"" color, the hype about the hyaluronic acid failed me as I found this product to do next to nothing regarding moisturizing my skin. In fact, it was sort of cakey. I would not wear this makeup without the moisturizing serum underneath. If your face is oily, this may be a good product for you. My friends and I are all over 60 years in age and no longer have oily complexions and need more moisture than this product delivers. * bro good one * So many skin tints are out in the market but this is hands down the easiest to use, hydrating without being too glowy or shiny and perfect amount of coverage for me. I use the shade 5-6 Medium Tan and it works well in the summer (have to use one shade lighter in the winter). Since it's a skin tint, the staying power by itself is not amazing but if I set it with powder and spray my face with setting spray, it lasts all day without touch ups."

The other is double wear. I am light medium olive and use either 5.5N or 6N depending upon the time of year.  My skin is on the drier side skin but I have no issues . I do however hydrate properly. Toner or Serum, moisturizer and then the glow serum. Foundation, setting powder and setting spray, It stays well. * Checks all the boxes: 
Skin type: oily
Coverage needs: full
Longwearing: excelent 
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED * I like it. My shade sent was a little too light so I mixed it with a darker color. It is creamy and provides good coverage. * Light/med shade with neutral undertone, mature skin. sadly it's separated a lot throughout the day. I'm not sure if I was using the wrong primer or my sunblock was too sheer, but I really struggled with this foundation * Unfortunately, this was one of the foundations i wanted to purchase for a long time. I finally did when it went on sale. Maybe it's my skin. But this is total failure for me. The color changes and becomes more drier. * Doesn't settle in creases moisturizing and breathable all at once and truly stars all day!"

I am 60 years old and it gives me enough coverage. Also gives me a nice glow. My face looks refreshed and so much younger anyway best foundation I've tried in a long time. We'll definitely be buying again. * First  foundation that actually matched my skin, literally covers everything ans stays on, i wanted to love it but on my first try I noticed dry brown patches after I cleaned my face and  was very dry, not for me 😞 * I love this foundation, it is very lightweight so I had to use a heavy moisturizer and thick primer. It worked well with both NYX and Provedence drugstore primers.

Also my deep skin discoloration are covered with a tiny amount. I use liquid bronzer and blush with it and it pairs well with Pacifica and Maybelline liquid products. Once this foundation dries on your skin, it will break up if you add liquid or oil makeup on top- but as long as I do it all at one it sets the makeup and last for my work day. 

FYI I set my face with pixi skin veil and it wasn't too drying on my dry skin. They recommended I get a shade lighter foundation to cover and it gave me full coverage. The only con is my local Ulta doesn't sell it so I have to buy online. * this is so watery I don't even know how you're supposed to apply it. I wore it for one day and within a few hours started developing a severe rash on my skin that has lasted for several days. would not recommend. * I'm obsessed with this foundation! You don't feel like you are wearing anything! It's life changing! * This is actually a first… I've never experienced a foundation that manages to be extremely watery, yet also cakey at the same time. Unsure what kind of mystery this is, because it's certainly not a good one. Color was also extremely off and orange. Also more on the natural matte side, NOT radiant like it says. * This foundation does exactly what it says,"" Your skin but better"". Absolutely love this foundation."

I sometimes wear it for 15 hours and doesnt look bad. I get asked all the time what foundation im wearing with the amazonian clay! * This foundation works very well for me. It gives full coverage without having to use a heavy application. There are many colors to choose from * Does not work for me as it doesn't blend, it just cakes up. It also kind of ""sits"" inside pores rather than blurring pores. I've been blending a tiny bit of it with a face tint just too use it up because it's too expensive to throw away. Wish I had returned it a while ago. * I have sensitive skin and this is one of the not so many that doesn't have hyaluronic acid. the color is good and a little goes a long way * Better coverage then Estée Lauder foundation

It doesn't settle into wrinkles as bad. * I finally found a foundation that doesn't accentuate the wrinkles on my face. It's light and smooth, and still covers my face naturally. I have been using this product for years. Very happy with my results. * Since i love laura setting power i thought i was going to love this foundation but it squirts more than a cat !!it will spray on you , your clothes like huh ?? Unbelievable and even thigj my skin is dry this feels like cooking grease and spreads all over your face in like 2 hours and you emd up looking a hot funky mess . * Yes, foundation is so light and goes on so smoothly and evenly. I love it and we'll definitely buy it again. * I have purchased this product  twice. I love it. The coverage is good without being heavy and it doesn't  contain harmful ingredients. * When you press the pump the product shoots out. So, if you want to get a little product  out to place on your fingertip, this is not for you. Also, it squirts out with too much force so it goes all over the place if you're not extremely careful.  I prefer a foundation that you are able to extract a small amount.  Additionally, while the product is light weight, when it dries you can see it if you have any lines. I like foundations that do not show in creases and this does after drying. * When I put this on my face in the morning, I thought it looked really nice.  But about 6 hours later, it needed to be reapplied and was dry and setting in wrinkles.  I tried it alone, with primer and it just didn't work for my dry skin.  I returned it."

However, even on bad application days, a couple hours later I'm always amazed by how amazing my skin looks. * This goes on light and smooth. Gives nice coverage when you want to look natural. Has SPF 30. * I needed a replacement for my favorite Les Beiges tinted SPF moisturizer by Chanel, which was discontinued :(. An ULTA assistant pointed me in the direction of Laura Mercier's tinted moisturizer with SPF, which has been great (I'm on my third tube—each has lasted me about 9 months with daily use). I like how this product lightly balances out redness, gives a subtle glow, doesn't bother my skin, and is breathable. * I'm very picky when it comes to base makeup. I have dry/normal skin, a light-medium olive skintone, and I deal with dullness/discoloration. Shade 2N1 is a good shade match for me. I've enjoyed using this with a dense foundation brush. It's easy to sheer out or build up. I would describe it as light/medium coverage. It evens out my skin tone, but doesn't cover blemishes. Its very comfortable on the skin, it feels like a moisturizer, the consistency is thick at first, but it doesn't feel like anything when blended out. I can wear it without powder and it stays on all day for me. Definitely repurchasing. * I've been using this product for years!  I don't like thick heavy coverage so this is very light buildable coverage.  I have pretty good skin, 38 years old, cheeks are pink from dryness with few blemishes and this provides me full coverage.  I do add a thin layer of moisturizer (especially now that I'm older and less oily) and concealer for under my eyes, nose and any glaring blemishes.  It's a very natural finish that does pull warm.  I use 2N1 for my winter everyday color and 2W1 for summer when I'm tanned (it's very yellow/gold). * The Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer goes on nicely,  bur doesnt cover ANY imperfections. Some pilling.  I was hoping to love it, but will be returning it."

Would have liked a cooler fair shade but the lightest shade i was able to blend into my neck and make it work * I have nothing bad to say about this foundation! It offers a stunning lightweight finish that is never cakey, even long after it has set in on your skin. One thing I really love about this product is that its lightweight qualities allow either a medium or full coverage look that is perfectly & easily buildable to your liking. It spreads on the skin easily as well and does not dry or set in too quickly. It is my favorite of all foundations by far!!!!! * I purchased this foundation with low hopes because I was not liking any of the Chanel products in the last decade and boy was I wrong! I have combo skin, used two pumps to get full coverage and was shocked by the results. Gave a soft matte finish with amazing plump, glowing looking skin. Worth the money but I will say prep your skin greatly so you can get your money's worth! * Good coverage, i got the perfect shade match, looks really great on the skin and it is lightweight.

Her name is Crystal.  She got me all taken care of with numerous products that do everything I asked for!  You don't find people like this very often, * Color matches skin perfectly. It is lite to touch and use very little to apply. Will purchase again. * Great coverage. * So ive always tried to wear lancome teinte idole in matte. Alot of others can still wesr with thier dry skin; i however, cannot. When this first came out, i bought right away. I was certain it would not work because shade was a dark orangey neutral for the lightest neutral. 

I am a pale mature and dry skin woman. It did oxidize a bit BUT, it stayed the neutral amd then seemed to work with my skin and like, color corrected or something. I have no idea.  I just know that i love this, looks beautiful, stays on all day, tad bit of a glow, but not really. Its a perfect hint of something. * I sought help from the clerk for a color match.  She matched me with the wrong color and I can't use it.I use Lancome so it wasn't the product's problem. * This foundation feels very good on my skin and covers very well! * I ordered this march 2025 and have been using it and frankly i always loved this foundation. One time it was in front of me and i noticed 2024, took me a minute to realize ive been using an expired foundation since march. I got one for my mom the same day and it expires in december 2025. Ulta should not ship products that expired or have less than a year. Really upset about it, but the foundation itself is fantastic"
56,about-face,the performer skin-focused foundation,pimprod2043010,2618950," * Not a fan of the applicator as an acne prone girl. This foundation also transfers very easily, even when set with powder and setting spray. They have a great shade range and my skin looked evened out and glowy but returned due to the transferring issues. * A lot of 'cool' shades end up warm on me, which is especially difficult being a 'barely there' makeup user. The way thid blends to blur out blemishes is amazing, and its gentle on my eczema prone skin. Its also a lot of product for the price. Just give it a good shake if its been sitting for a while before using. * U e never repurchased a foundation so much!! I love this formula in any season! I also love that they have olive tones!! * I've been using this foundation for the past year and I am obsessed with it. It is lightweight but it does have some coverage. It somehow looks better overtime,  its sits beautifully on the skin. It is not going to be full coverage, more light to medium. So underrated. * This is the first foundation ive ever had to return. The neutral was bright yellow, im not even exaggerating normally i could make it work by mixing with something else but it was so bad i had to return it * Definitely not a full coverage foundation, but it can be light to medium and look stunning. This is my second bottle. A great tone for neutral light skin tones. * literally one of the BEST foundations i've ever used, second to only my $72 georgio armani one. its literally skin in a bottle, but better, and my skin looks great even after i take jt off because the formula is filled with skincare! i took off my makeup and immediately began writing this revview because j need everyone to know how amazing this foundation is. high recommend!"

Perfect if not a fan of foundation but a step up from tinted moisturizer. More similar to CC cream. Light/ neutral undertone skin & wear neutral 3 fall/winter * I just overall didnt like it product.. it wad thick, unlike the stick foundation. It was just as glowy but yet had bad coverage. * May work for others yet didn't for me. It didn't stay on long. It did look natural as it stated. Even just chillin around doing nothing it faded away. * This foundation is worth every penny. I love the way it goes onto the skin and it leaves your face feeling soft with a subtle glow. It's so easy to color match with numbers in each skin tone category, light, neutral, etc. I love this foundation. * So pleased with this purchase! First time buying this foundation and kind of tried it on a whim! Goes on nicely and has good buildable coverage. Very happy so far! * I was veru hopeful for this product and i have combination skin on my t zone, but somehow with this product i was very oily to the touch on my whole face and felt my skin very slick after using, goes on very well and can be buildable but unfortunately was a bad experience on my end."

You get coverage but it looks so natural on and stays all day. * might try to mix with another foundation * Beautiful coverage and the first foundation I've found that actually conceals large pores. 
Don't be fooled by the name matte, it's actually a very hydrating formula.  Great for mature skin. * Nice coverage would prefer no scent due to the added ingredients. * My favorite foundation. I've repurchased many times because I like the light weight formula and full coverage. It also has a pleasant smell thats not overpowering. I have oily skin and this keeps me nice and matte. * Did something change with the formula or did my skin change? It used to look beautiful on me the past 2 years, now it separates and just sits on my skin towards the end of the day; very noticeable where it is and where it isnt. Ive never had a foundation do that. Regardless if it is my skin that has has changed or the formula, the bottle continues to be terrible, squirts out everywhere, on my walls and clothes and therefore gets only 1 star for that. * Wish it worked on my skin but it doesn't! Oily/combo, used Dior velvet primer"

60,clinique,acne solutions liquid makeup foundation,pimprod2043524,2619813," * Clinique recommended this when they discontinued their Stay Matte foundation, but it's been a terrible substitute. Despite the product name, it makes my skin breakout way more than it did with Stay Matte, and there's no oil or shine control. * I absolutely love this foundation. Blends super super well with any other product, or is perfect by itself. ONLY complaint is that it will (sometimes) cling to dry patches if your primer wasnt dense enough there. Other then that, its perfect. * It does not break me out. My dermatologist said it was good for me to use. Offers moderate coverage without a heavy feel. I had the consultant at the clinque counter help me match my skin tone with was very helful. * I have been using this  for 25 yrs. Same color just ordered and upon application, it is a completely different shade- much darker and turns orange.
PLEASE bring back old formula or figure out same shade. I even tried to match with a new color and none of them match. * The other day I tried alabaster (""matched"" at the store) and it oxidized. Went back and tried linen and it was the perfect match! I tried other cheaper foundations but sticking with this again because it's the best for my face! * I used to use Ivory (02) for years. I stopped wearing foundation for a couple years (not enough time with kids) and switched to a tinted sunscreen. I wanted more coverage so went and got alabaster but it oxidized so quickly! Will be returning! * This is my go to foundation. Having some acne issues, this foundation controls the acne."
61,fenty beauty by rihanna,eaze drop blur + smooth foundation stick,pimprod2041564,2614177," * I really like this, i was looking for a face tint but realized i need more coverage and better color match and i decided to try this. It was perfect for travel mess free. Find my shade was easy since i use the foundation same brand so i was able to look for a match. Feels good on skin not heavy at all and last long. * This is the first makeup product I have ever used and it turned out so beautiful! For a beginner like me, it was really easy to use and I could almost not tell a difference except that it make my skin tone more even. It is not heavy, it is very lightweight and super complementary. I purchased the Color 20 and used it along with the Juvia's place bronzer in the color Tan. It definitely elevates my make up look and the color match is crazy! Thank you Riri, you're truly a bad gyal for this one!! * I was looking for a skin tint that wouldnt leave me looking greasy, was recommended this, and it didnt go as planned. This left me very oily, i would have to put on a lot of setting powder throughout the day which was the whole point that i didnt want to have to do that. It also was a bit patchy under my eyes and by my nose and cheeks but that could have been something with my skin. If youre looking for something more less-coverage and not glowy, this isnt for you * This foundation stick is truly the best! It goes on smoothly and can be used just a little for a light makeup natural look or for a full-on glam look. It blends perfectly and doesn't crease. I'm on the older side and some makeup seems to fill my wrinkles and highlight them and this does not do that. It really is one of the best foundation choices I've used so far, and you can build on it if you want more coverage. I even use it to even out my skin when I don't want to wear any other makeup. It is my newest favorite as are most of the Fenty products. * The color match is perfect and the ease in applying and the coverage are excellent. * MAC messed up when they changed their colors, because this is what I replaced it with and I like it better! No irritation on my sensitive skin. I can't feel it, and actually forgot to wash it off one night.. no acne or irritation the next morning.  No dryness * Does not wear well regardless of the type of primer or setting powder I used. It didn't last more than 2 hours. This is genuinely the worst product I've used in a while. I wanted to like it so much but it just wore terribly. Product was silky and smooth"
62,fenty beauty by rihanna,soft'lit naturally luminous hydrating longwear foundation,pimprod2045514,2624152," * I'm sure this is a good product for younger skin, but I wouldn't recommend for mature skin.  I tried everything to get this to work before returning.  It settles in fine lines even with primer, and doesn't last long. * I love this foundation * Great coverage.  Great match. * Love * Love this foundation! * Good coverage. Moisturizing * Impressed! Glides on and blends like a dream, not heavy, silky, looks like skin. Doesn't accentuate lines, wrinkles or pores. I just love my new foundation. For reference, I'm 63, moderate aging, lines and wrinkles, hyperpigmentation. I used NARS sheer glow foundation previously and  loved it also but for some reason the color is just too orange on me now since winter is coming, I think NARS had a little more coverage, only dislike is I think it accentuates pores a little more. NARS color line has no other match for my skin color, seems like  most of their colors run quite yellow/orange that's why I decided to try another foundation brand.  I did try using the LA girl white pigment and added a teeny speck to the NARS foundation which made the shade better and not so yellow/orange as a side note, loved that product also for being so cheap. I think the Fenty foundation looks just a little more natural on me since I'm getting older. I also tried Natasha Denonas new foundation and liked that also but was a little heavier than the Fenty Luminous Silk."
63,hourglass,veil hydrating skin tint,pimprod2040571,2611435," * I've always had a problem feeling trapped under foundation so I stick to tinted moisturizers. Even with tinted moisturizers, some feel sticky or not breathable. This gives me enough sheer coverage to even me out but doesn't make me feel trapped. It feels like I'm applying moisturizer. I'm naturally oily so I do set it with powder. I recently switched to this brand by chance and I'm glad I did. A little goes a long way for me so it's worth the price tag. I also apply with my fingers vs a brush but only because I don't like the feeling of something sitting on my face vs melted in to my skin. I'm very sensitive and this doesn't clog my pores. Definitely worth a try! * I love light coverage and a Dewey even greasy finish. I have dry skin and work in a very dry environment. But this has zero coverage amplified every pore and every time I wore it, I developed a new pimple. I'm in my 50s and don't break out from any of my other foundations. * I love this product, my daughter bought it and suggested I try it, it's not too heavy and that's what I wanted * I got all these little red bumps and acne breakouts, so bad. * Just enough coverage to hide imperfections. Texture light enough that wrinkles don't stand out. A bit concealer and blush…and ready for the day. * Lucky for me there is a color match. Texture, also, is right for me. Not too heavy looking, but just enough coverage. * This product is really great.  I don't wear foundation or a lot of makeup but wanted a hydrating pick me up for my daily wear.  This tint is lightweight, hydrating, and I love that it doesn't feel heavy nor greasy.  It lasts all day."
64,morphe,filter effect soft-focus foundation,pimprod2022516,2577758," * This is a nice foundation, I like it but the top just falls off.  It doesn't stay on if I want to travel with it in my makeup bag, and I've dropped the bottle by picking it up by its 2.5""lid several times.   Packaging needs work.   I'd only refer it to a friend with the warning about poor ability to close it and keep the pump sanitary. * I liked this foundation a lot! It matched my skin tone really well, and is a really affordable price. It's a nice size, and usually lasts me over four months to finish. The only bad thing is that it takes a while to blend in and I find myself having to go over it with a beauty blender or brush a lot. I do still really like it though and it covers up many imperfections. * The best foundation ever!!!!!! * Patchy, greasy , I was disappointed ☹️ * Great price so, I thought to give it a try. It's not a bad foundation but not one that squeals excitement. Blends pretty well but after a while it seems to pool into lines and makes imperfections noticeable. Would probably be a good product for dry skin * I like how it blends out and has the perfect coverage for everyday use. * I like how it blends out and has the perfect coverage for everyday use."
65,urban decay,face bond self-setting waterproof foundation,pimprod2044818,2623593," * That is a very, very good product. Keep it on the shelf. * This is what replaced their old naked skin weightless foundation and it doesnt even compare. I love they kept the matte finish but this one definitely makes my skin not look as flawless. Almost splotchy in places. Bring back the old one! It was my absolute favorite!!! * I have realllyyy oily skin.  NOTHING lasts and always seems to crease or seperate around my nose, chin, and forehead.  I bought this when it was on sale because I figured it was worth a try for the price and after a month of use its safe to say that so far nothing has compared for me.  I currently have it on and after 11 hours + work for 7 it still looks BEAUTIFUL.  I'd recommend to anyone that has oily skin, it might not be the best for dry skin though but I've never noticed any clinging to dry patches with this one either * My fav skin tint! * I absolutely LOVE this foundation! Its buildable, and a little goes a long way! I love a natural/matte look, so i really enjoy how this looks on my skin. I have acne and scarring, as well as redness. It doesnt feel heavy, and it lasts me over 12 hours along with my skin prep. * Eh, it's alright. I have fair and neutral skin. But it's also dry, so I have to work quick with this foundation or it will start pulling apart as I work with it. It also settles into my pores after some time if the layer is too thick. And while it's a decent shade match, it tends to pull yellow on me * I had only used this a handful of times & its a complete waste of money, it exploded and there's practically nothing left."
66,jane iredale,purepressed base mineral foundation refill,pimprod2033383,2595091," * I recently switched to a CC cream instead of foundation and I love it, but I needed something to set it with as it is pretty shiny. I tried a setting powder but didn't love it and decided to try this instead since I have several other Jane Iredale products that I love. This powder foundation has quickly become my new favorite! It applies beautifully and literally looks the exact same at 6 PM as it did at 6 AM. I chose the color radiant and it could not match my skin any better than it does. I am so thrilled with it, I am tempted to buy a few more so I never run out. Please never discontinue this or change it, it is perfect!!! * This foundation is a glitter bomb. After application it looked like I was park of the Cullen family. It accentuated all of my pores and did NOT keep my oils at bay. Terrible. Immediately returned. * This tops any other foundation or skin tint I have tried before (and that list is very long). This looks like your skin if it was perfectly even and plump. Does not settle into file lines and lasts sooo long on even without touch ups. Love the good ingredients and feel good about what I'm putting on my skin. I have gotten so many compliments since I started wearing it. Shade range is great too. Literally the best for reactive/sensitive skin. * This mineral foundation is my favorite and the only one I use. Liquid foundations just roll off my face. This foundation stays in place and gives me enough coverage. You can dust it on lightly or keep applying for more coverage. * I have been using this for almost 25 years, nothing can beat it. It was originally created by a plastic surgeon for her patients after surgery at her practice. Then it made it's way to estheticians and finally retail.  The coverage is fantastic. I live in Florida's heat and humidity and it stands up to it perfectly. I personally believe the sunscreen has helped me to keep the sun damage at bay as well. I saw a review that said it had sparkles. I have never seen that in all this time. Perhaps it was confused with the BM label??? I use the Real Techniques powder sponge (the one thats super light and airy) as it does not come with an applicator. Also it does not come in a compact. My suggestion is to try it and then purchase theirs after you fall in love with it or decide it is not for you. I have had my current compact for about 6 years and it is easy to pop in the next refill. There is a little hole in the back that is about the size of a paper clip tip and you can just push it out. There is a magnet that holds it in place. It really does save on throwing everything in a landfill. It finishes beautifully with PS On Till Dawn setting spray. I will say that as my skin has ""matured"" I do not try to use as much as my skin is drying up. BTW i use it as a setting powder , hence the trying to back off some as i have aged, but it is great as just a foundation too. Hope this review helps. This stuff is like a secret miracle. (I dont work for them. My friend was an esthetician and turned me on to it as I am a long time makeup fan) * It doesn't say that the product has sparkles - I don't do sparkles on foundation, it looks childish. Also, the finish is not ""skin-like"" but very mate. That's a no for me. * This stuff feels like you have nothing on your face and doesn't irritate my super sensitive skin at all. The light beige is the best color match I've ever had for my cool skin tone. The only drawback is I wish it wasn't so expensive."
67,dior,dior forever fluid skin glow foundation,pimprod2036824,2605019," * I wanted to try this a few times before giving my final thoughts. Im a healthcare worker who regularly works 12 hour shifts. That being said, I have tried & tested SO many foundations this year. My issue with other foundations is the fact that it doesnt last through a shift. I was always dealing with creasing, patching, flaking and just looking cakey. I tried different skin prep, primers, setting powders/ sprays and nothing changed. Ive been wanting to try this foundation now for a while and finally did.. and let me tell you- this is the best purchase ive ever made. It holds up beautifully, and it still looks just as amazing at the end of the day. Every issue ive had with other foundations, never happened with this. 
I have very sensitive & acne prone skin and this has not given me any sort of reaction or break out. My first shift wearing it, i received so many compliments. It gave me my confidence back! I will continue to repurchase this. * I dont have sensitive skin. I never broke out from a cosmetic product and this immediately caused the worst reaction on my face. My skin was dry itch and peeling. This foundation has a fragrance in it and it is not good for the skin. Sucks because i really liked the product. * I bought this for my mom. She loved it so much that I had to buy one for myself. The coverage is outstanding. We have been using it for a bit now, this is her 4th bottle and my 1st. Will definitely buy again! * This foundation leaves a beautiful dewy finish in my over 50 skin!! * Dior doesn't disappoint.  Even better layered. Do the coverage that works for you.  Lasts all day perfectly. * Too expensive. I wear it everyday. * Received my order today from Ulta, and it's already expired. Will buy directly from Dior from now on. Do better, Ulta."
68,anastasia beverly hills,"medium coverage, natural finish luminous foundation",pimprod2008586,2551421," * I tried this product on a black friday sale and let me just say, i'm highly disappointed.
The palest shade was too dark and orangey and it was so cakey and felt so uncomfortable on. Looked terrible. * I've been using this foundation for 5 years and its always gone on quite nicely. I like the variety of colors offered. I'm pretty pale with cool undertones so its haed to me to find products that dont either wash me out or make me look orange. But the most recent bottle I bought is not only much more watery than usual, bht also has a MUCH warmer tone thay makes me look yellow-y. Still a decent and usuable product so i will get through the bottle, but im disappointed that i will have to find a new foundation. * I LOVE this foundation!! Goes on so smoothly and definitely gives a soft natural look even with it being almost to full coverage. We just need more lighter shades! Unfortunately 120N being the lightest shade its still warm for me so its the perfect summer shade, but we need something lighter for us very pale girlies in the winter. * This foundation is absolutely gorgeous with a perfect in-between finish. Unfortunately, they only have a shade for when I have self-tanner on -- it looks like 110C would have been a perfect natural match, but it was discontinued. Bummer! * After four bottles and shaking it vigorously, it stays seoarated with white cream stuff. Formula changed and company isn't cooperative. Lots of other reviews say same. Avoid. Too much money for this foundation. * I bought this foundation with the expectation that this might be a game changer because of the price and the reviews.  What a waste of money.  The foundation does NOT look luminous or natural in coverage (contrary to the text on the box) – it actually looks dry and cakey.  I suppose, if you have perfect skin and applied heavy moisturizer to your face first, and then applied this foundation, it may look luminous but so would every other foundation on the market.  Why this company, with its 'Beverly Hills' label, thinks it's foundation product is worth what they charge, is ludicrous, unless their marketing strategy is to attract idiots that want to blow a wad of cash on expensive crap.  I will never buy this product again. * I ordered this for the first time and was very impressed! I like how easy it is to blend and the shade match is really nice too."

The coverage is great and it leaves your skin radiant with a natural looking glow. * I've used this for many years on my mature (aka old!) skin. Recently bought a bottle of foundation at a department store , used it less than a week, threw it out & went to Ulta for Tarte Foundcealer! Will never change. * Unfortunately the foundation is going back. Price was reasonable compared to others. It applies well. It is dewey once on so if you don't want dewey this is not for you. Biggest thing was the color. Even though they color matched me after wearing it the foundation brought out more of the yellow in my skin. I was really hoping this would work. * I have used Tarte's Foundcealer for over seven years, and I always recommend it to my friends!! It is the perfect amount of dewy, all-day coverage. Love it! * I love this! It goes on smoothly with a nice, creamy texture and has great coverage. I love it for my ""no makeup"" days where I want to conceal dark circles and blemishes but don't want to shellac my face with a ton of concealer. Works wonderfully with my mature skin too! * I ordered on line 7/2025.The product arrived with expiration date of 5/2023.Ulta was great and  sent out a new one.The new on arrived,unfortunately it was the same lot number and expiration date.I love Ulta they refunded my money. * It fits perfectly on my skin tone"

So sad they will discontinue 😭 * My heart is breaking knowing this product will be discontinued. This was litterally the best skin tint i ever owned * This is the best tinted moisturizer I have tried! I have combination skin so my skin is very particular about what products I use. I am distraught knowing that this will be discontinued 😭😭 * I have oily skin and this does not work well with it. Also, I don't understand why when I apply, it's like clumps up. Even when others have said you can layer other products with it. I have applied of fresh clean skin and after applying, it would rub off in clumps if I rubbed too much. * I love this product so much, ive been using it for a year. I never been a fan of thick foundation and this product has saved me from looking cakey. I love by itself and when i do a full face of makeup. * You would think this being advertised as clean ingredient based that it wouldnt break you out and the niacinamide would be a great additive to this. But no.. i wore it one time 3 days ago and woke up today with 4 pustils and 1 cystic blemish!"

It's greasy, cakey and settles in every line and pore on my face. It is so bad, it's nothing like the original formula. After about 3 hours of wearing it, I couldn't handle how bad it looked and how greasy and cakey it got. Never wearing this again! * I have super oily skin and sometimes my makeup just doesn't last. However, I wore this for my wedding in August and it wore so beautifully. Even by the end of the night I still had coverage! Got so many compliments on my makeup. It's my go-to now! * Omg so i dont really use matte foundations because unfortunately i have very dry skin but something cool I discovered playing with make up is use a tinted moisturizer foundation with this foundation and you girlies dont know how beautiful this looks 😍 * I tried to love it but I just dont. I used a primer, and have dry ish skin. Not terribly dry, no dry patches. This did not look good at all on my skin. It broke apart and made my skin look much much worse than it did without makeup. I used a brush to apply and it just looked like I threw it on but I took my time to do it. Looked terrible 😂 * I love my makeup"

But it completely fell out.. like the product wasn't even pressed into the pan or glued or however they make it stay. So starting off my product was a little dirty and broken. But like I said it's fine if you have oily skin, nothing amazing but still worth the price. * It's okay, it's good for sunny days to help protect the face. * This was a great alternative to the MAC powder I was using but this is the third compact I have bought in two months as the powder crumbles and is useless. It's expensive to only last a couple weeks. Not buying again. * I have used this product for a while.  I don't know what has changed but now the powder crumbles before I can get half way through the contents. A huge waste of money. * I have used this product for years, but recently had one of them break/crumble during regular use and had to replace it. My replacement one is now also crumbling after just a few weeks. Will not be buying this ever again :-( * It does stay all day on my mature skin and I try other products but keep coming back to this one.

It isn't cakey at all. It last. It gives you a flawless overall fresh look. I feel far more confident with this * It's great very delicate product, I love it! * Hate how expensive it is. But i have reactive sensitive crusty dry skin and this is the only tint that doesnt cling to my dry patches and looks naturally radiant. Does not clog pores either. * This is a repurchase, that's how much i love this. It's light yet gives enough coverage and it makes my skin look fresh and young.  Love it, can't beat Chanel!! * This product is very light in coverage, but good thing is u can use it for summer or winter, color match is easy u can't go wrong, for summer u can use a powder to give a little coverage and take down the dew. For winter its hydrating and powder application will not make it look cakey it will give a healthy glow look. * It's definitely as others said a very light coverage. I didn't find it buildable and it did come off easily
Without a setting spray. But I do like the way it looks it's basically like a glowy not wearing makeup look. For the price tho I wouldn't buy it again I don't think."

I'm so bummed I'll have to find a foundation to use in a different brand. * Love this foundation for my combination skin. * I won't even allow this product to come near my face. It contains an astonishing TWELVE separate forms of silicone (including dimethicone as the 2nd ingredient, following water). This has more silicone than most silicone-based face primers, so if this is what you are seeking, just buy a cheap silicone-based primer and powder; I think you'd end up with a similar result. Even with all it's additives, it still lacks sunscreen (chemical or physical), although the thought of adding sunscreen to this already pore-stifling mixture makes my face sweat just thinking about it.

With a name like Clinique, we except you to formulate proceducts with skin-loving ingredients. Cosmetics companies can no longer get away with adding whatever cheap ingredients they wish in order to achieve the façade of temporarily healthy skin. Consumers have educated themselves and we know too much now.

Do better, Clinique. * Great product * I had high hopes for this foundation since it was described as for very dry mature skin.  Nope, too thick, wrong color choice (my mistake), no matter how lightly I applied it still caked in creases & wrinkles."
75,kvd beauty,good apple skin-perfecting hydrating foundation balm,pimprod2022990,2577085," * I love this makeup!  I have normal/dry skin and it hydrates well without being thick, oily, or heavy.  I have light warm/olive toned skin color Medium 027 is perfect for the winter.  I will go one shade darker for the summer just to add a little extra color.  I use Lancôme Dual Finish Powder Foundation (dry not wet) to set the makeup and it lasts all day.  Stays on even when I've been swimming or working out and sweating. * Literally melts off my face and i have dry skin. Ive tried different primers and it always ends up making me so oily. I never write reviews good or bad but this was just so terrible it deserved one * This foundation is one of my holy grails. It takes some time experimenting with the application but once you get it down it literally wears so well! If you get too heavy handed applying it I can guarantee you won't like it. Also, Light 018 is literally the best shade match I've ever had with a foundation! * Yes, a little goes a long way and I use my fingers to blend, but it's fantastic, the color match is perfect and is hydrating and covers the lines and texture on my 49 year old face. I totally recommend for dry, mature skin. * It works great for me. I was looking for a light hydrating makeup with full coverage that is vegan and cruelty free and this seems to be it! * This has been my everyday product for over five years. There is not a day where I don't use it, I have been using it as my bronzer. There's nothing like this in my opinion. I have sensitive skin and I'm prone to break out and this has never made me break out. I have gotten many of my friends on it. You won't regret it! * This is my foest review ever. I felt compelled to share my experiance with this product. First im a makeup artist and esthetician. Im Picky when it comes to my clients, and of course my own makeup. When I say i have tried every foundation under the sun, i sincerley mean it. From extreme high end, department store, spa grade, boutique brand, indie brand, drug store etc, you name it and ive either tried it or worked with it. This foundation right here checked ALL my boxes. I am oily but dehydrated on my face. I bought this a while back and used it once and put it in my back of my vanity!  Went back to estee lauder. My makeup got to where i just was not pleased with the look of my makeup so i said ill give kvd another try because i see all the youtubers working with creams so i said what the heck. After learning the correct skin prep and correct tool for this forumulation i can say i am very VERY well pleased with this product. I have textured creapy creasy pores etc and this product make my skin look perfected in everyway. Played great with all my other products as well. I used all nighter setting spray to lock this product in and it wore for 11 hours in 104 degrees nc heat and still looked great before i removed it. Very very well pleased. I will be buying a back up and all other kvd products!"
76,chanel,les beiges healthy glow foundation hydration and longwear,pimprod2030080,2571508," * I've used a ton of different foundations over my life, and so far this is the best one. It covers well and it doesn't look cake-y on my skin. I am 66 years old with drier patches on my cheeks and I've found this to be moisturizing enough that it helps the drier areas without making the 't-zone' look too shiny. I'd definitely recommend trying it, * If you have mature skin and are looking for natural, medium coverage, this is for you. My only complaint is the fragrance but it fades quickly and the product is so good, I'll live with it. You can sheer it out or build it up and the finish is gorgeous. At 61, my face is showing the years and I went through a dozen foundations before finally finding this. This lasts all day and the finish is truly ""you but better"" with the perfect amount of coverage and dewiness. 10/10 * I absolutely love this foundation. I was scared to try it beacuse of the price but it is worth every penny. It wears beautifully. It doesn't emphasize my blemishes or settle into fine lines. It makes your skin look healthy and hydrated. It lasts throughtout the day and looks natural. I'm super picky when it comes to foundations and this one won me over. * I have been wearing Nars foundation for about a year.  I noticed some issues so decided to try a few other foundations.  As soon as I tried this one I was like wow.  This goes on like a moisturizer.  It's so hydrating. It doesn't settle into fines lines. It's very smooth and has a nice scent.  I'm 54 and have sensitive skin and this works great for my skin.  I bought B20 and the color matches my skin perfect.  I have dry skin and this is a perfect foundation for those with a more dryer complexion and who need that moisture throught the day.  It is a little pricey but to me it's worth the investment in my skin.  Give it a try.  I'm sure you will notice a difference with your skin in a positive way. * Unfortunately this foundation did not make the cut.  I have been trying to find something to replace my go to, Chanel's Vitalumiere Aqua , which apparently Chanel has taken off the shelves to reformulate . 
Chanel's Les Beiges Healthy Glow foundation seemed to be a fit color wise but the scent is overbearing, the coverage is splotchy and it melts right off. * Ehh I wouldn't repurchase, it's pretty and wears nicely throughout the day but the cons outweigh the pros to me. I need complexion products that work with other complexion products and this does not do that. * This is one of the best foundations I've ever used. I usually attend a cycling class during lunch, take a quick shower, and head straight back to the office without reapplying makeup. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the foundation still looked flawless and radiant on my skin. I absolutely loved it."

It provides good coverage, it's lightweight, it lasts all day, and it's great for problems skin! * Best foundation I've ever used, I will never buy anything else!!! * I use it to cover my mild melasma and I love it doesn't cake like other products, it feels light and not greasy. * How can you send me used and durty product , i paid my money to receive good quality service but now i will return everything and close my credit card * Color was too dark. * Was recommended this and loved it!"
81,nars,light reflecting advanced skincare foundation,pimprod2030141,2591148," * They were out of my normal foundation from nars. It has good coverage but it runny when you put it on and doesnt have the same luster as radiant wear foundation. Its ok for a change but wouldn't purchase again. * I used the foundation finder tool on NARS' website and it recommended the shade Patagonia.  It was a perfect match!  I apply it with a brush and use 2 tiny pumps of foundation and it covers everything - blemishes, dark circles, etc.  Does not look like I am wearing foundation which is the key. * I love this foundation so much, its goes on so smoothly, it blends well and its oily friendly. I have my summer and my winter shades. * I've been using NARS foundation for a few years and love everything about it. I had been using  Armani foundation and due to prices increases I tried NARS and never went back. NARS is comparable to Armani and more affordable. * It's pretty good but I don't think it's a product I would purchase again. There are other foundations that are equal to this one that aren't as expensive. I have dry skin and it works pretty well with it, however the overall feel of wearing it kinda bugs me. It feels like it sits on top of your skin rather than soaking into it. Also, please, for the love of everything, fix the pump and the cap. The pump shoots out the foundation, and the cap stopped connecting onto the bottle after some time. Gets quite messy. 

It does have a glowy, dewy finish and decent coverage, which is what I was looking for, so that's a plus. * I purchased this foundation because it had been recommended to me by multiple people as being ""safe for acne prone skin"". I am in my early 20s and have been on the hunt for a foundation that looks good and doesn't break me out. Unfortunately, it's not this one. Each time I used it my face flared up with more pimples. I wash my brushes after each use, and do thorough skin care prep to try to prevent a breakout as much as possible. I've worn this foundation many times because I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt, but I've been left with horrific pimples that I am trying to get rid of months later. The makeup does look amazing on the skin and it does have that very light Dewey look to it and covers acne very well, but the after effects are not worth it. I have deep painful pimples on my face now. * This is the best liquid foundation i have ever used! Genuinely sooooo worth the price. My skin looks so fresh and clean when i use this foundation. I like how it is buildable yet light weight. Just a must!!!"

You get the no-makeup makeup look effortlessly. I don't use a brush or sponge to apply, just my fingers, and a dime size covers my face. I got lucky; I stocked up before y'all sold it out! Yet, I'm glad you all found something that fits well! * Great color and application however through out the day starts to leave my skin a little greasy. * I've bought this twice now , trying to get it to work for me. I've used it with primer, no primer, fingers, sponge, brush. Its always peels and looks terrible. I'm pretty knowlegable when it comes to makeup and I've used alot of different foundations. I love Chanel and love some of their other foundation, but not this one. * I've been wearing this for 4 years and will never buy another.  It goes on light and easy, adds a nice luminous glow to my skin and provides even and light coverage. * Thank goodness ULTA Carrie's this now!! The ONLY foundation that does NOT settle in your fine lines and I have mega lines still doesn't settle, I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION, please chanel never discontinue this! * I love how my skin feels with this Chanel foundation it looks and feels so smooth. I've been using it for five years now. * I've literally tried 5 foundations in the last 2 months all claiming to do the same thing. I have acne scars very large pores deep smile lines that collect the makeup.... And I'm 53. All the nightmares!!!!  This foundation!!!  I mean common!!!  It covered everything!  It blurred the pores on my nose, which nothing ever has, it didn't settle it those deep lines, even the ones in the corner of my mouth!!!  I looked Dewey all day!  I felt like I was wearing nothing. It wasn't even the right shade cause they were out but I just used a bit of bronzer and omg perfection!!  I will never ever use anything else. Yes it's a bit fragrant but that disappears in a few hours no big deal."
83,smashbox,halo healthy glow tinted moisturizer broad spectrum spf 25,pimprod2016307,2568499," * I have been searching for years for a light coverage product that will just even out my skin tone without feeling heavy at all. I am really particular about my facial products and any kind of makeup- if it feels heavy at all, I won't continue to use it. this product is perfect for me! I have again, dry 40 year old skin. I do my skin care and apply this right after my moisturizer and it evens me out beautifully while allowing my skin to breathe! I wear light neutral shade and there's zero orange undertone. I can't feel the product on my face, it just feels like part of my skin care routine. it also contains SPF which is a huge plus as well. wears perfectly all day long without making me greasy at all, which tends to happen with all foundations I've tried. this covers all my redness which is exactly what I need. no breakouts and no scent. please never stop making this! * It was on clearance and I see why. If you have acne prone skin run the other direction from this product. I tried twice before realizing this was the root of my end of day flare ups!!! It did not take long for it to form cysts. * now that I'm in my 40s, my skin is changing. it's more dry and my pores are bigger, in addition to having discoloration from previous years of tanning and no SPF. I was looking for something very lightweight that I can't feel, that contains SPF and also evens out my skin tone while adding some glow. a tall order, but this product full the bill in full! I tried it without putting on moisturizer first, and I wouldnt recommend that. it wasn't quite moisturizing enough to stand on its own for me. so if you are drier, definitely moisturize first then apply right away. the glow is beautiful but not at all greasy. it blended right in with no tool needed, and my cream blush went on over it perfectly. didn't feel heavy at all either. in fact I forgot id put it on at all after a half hour or so. it evened out my skin tone beautifully while allowing my freckles to show through a little too. love it! * Goes on great! Even skin tone without looking like you are wearing too much makeup. * I love this product. It's light weight. It has a natural glow. You can wear it alone. I top it with a pressed powder foundation. I like that it has SPF coverage in it. It works good for my oily/combo skin. You just need to set it well with a good pressed powder. * Goes on nice and light like a bb , also fades quite quickly .  Good for minimalists * okay. if there is any review you listen to let it be this one. the product is ungodly hard to squeeze out of the package. it dries INSTANTLY and flakes everywhere. It is streaky and DRYING. the shades ranges are all tones of YELLOW. WHO WANTS THAT."
84,polite society,more than a pretty face skin-caring foundation,pimprod2040619,2615146," * I noticed i had to oump several times to get some prodcut. I thought it was just the applicator. Nope. Barely used 5 times and no product. Plus…. Eas to heavy and didnt blend with my other products. * so I bought this on Black Friday trying it on now so far it feels pretty good 
I think I will buy again * This is a great foundation, is long lasting for my oily leaning skin and the color matche is perfect. I'm very light neutral and I always have a hard time finding a foundation match since I'm between fair and light. The only problem is after three months of use the pump broke I'm I'm having to unscrew it and use the pump stick to get the foundation out, but it is very messy. I contacted polite society but they said they couldn't do anything since I bought it from Ulta and I need to return it to Ulta, but it's past the return time. it's a great foundation, but the pump breaking is disappointing and I've seen other reviewers have the same issue. * My skin gets very oily no matter what I do often, even with some primers and powders, the only foundation that have hold me and never let me down is EsteLauder double wear. Anyways I saw this one because so many people have talk about it, the shade match is on point and is very light on the skin. So far have been great and doesn't goes oily fast, stay in place and still look flawless all day, after couple of hours can get a little oily but with powder it looks like I just get my makeup done. Is very good and little goes a long way. No complaints about it, works great and keeps me matte when use with huda powder. * So I have been wanting to order this for a long time and was extremely excited when it was on sale was, expecting born this way quality. It is not.
While it's not a bad foundation, it does seem to settle into pores and Fine lines. Probably would not purchase again. And really really hate the bottle in the lid. It is the most ridiculous contraction crap. * Let'a start first with packaging. I saw a lot of comments about leakage of the foundation. I haven't experienced it yet however, the pump is so poorly done. It dispense so little product with each pump. So bad. Also it feels like whatever bottle I got was old or something because the product looks and feels dry. 
Then, the product consistency, if you have dry skin, DO NOT PURCHASE. I have combination skin and it works on some areas and others don't. So it is not ""instant hydration"" as they claim it is. 
I didn't love the finish, it's like ok. * I ordered this in very light cool and it looks VERY orange on me. I would stay away from this if your skin is cool toned. That being said, the formula is one of the best medium coverage buildable foundarions ive ever tried, so if they have a shade for you, definitley worth getting. Its light feeling with a true medium coverage and wears amazing, almost no breakdown even after a long day wearinf it"
85,estÃ©e lauder,futurist skin tint serum foundation spf 20,pimprod2041704,2612381," * Had high expectations but this skin tint is not fo mature skin. It creases all over the place and leavs too many golden particles on my face. I feel like too brigjt and shiny. I tried using the skin tint for an underpainting application. It is clearl too heavy to make that look flawless. I've tried powdering it doen as well to combst all the shine but whatever powder I tried, it became an ugly cakey mess. Just not at all a decent product. * Really oily, hard to build on, no coverage, doesnt seem to ""dry"" and a heavy spf smell. I was hoping for less oily spf and more or an under foundation correction/builder but this isnt it. Smears all day and doesn't set well. * I love this product, looks like im not wearing makeup at all and fits my skin color perfectly! * iT IS A PERFECT MATCH TO MY SKIN TONE * This product drew attention to all my pores and and hairs on my face. It did not go on smooth and almost ""bubbled and balled up"" and not smooth in. * I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. We went and had her color matched at Ulta and this was the best fit for her skin and color. She absolutely loves it. She doesn't have to use a lot so a little does go a long way. It is very pricey, but it makes her skin look even more prettier than it is will buy again for her. * I was excited to try this product but I just can't get it to consistently work with my skin. When I apply it pills up and separates. I've gotten it to work a handful of times but its too much trouble for the price and never knowing HOW its going to look. I'm sad because I wanted to love it- but I'm definitely going to be returning it."

Definitely would by again and possibly add a few shades to my kit. Please keep around * The old formula was so much better.  This one is fine.  The packaging is horrible.  The bottle leaks all the time and pumping it out is terrible.  It's like there is no spring in the pump.  Its a hard press and you cant really manage how much comes out. Then a drip leaks out after you press it, which is wasteful.  I like the foundation ok, but they desperately need to fix the bottle and pump. * Love the color & goes on so smooth. * Even though its light coverage, it makes your skin look amazing, with glow and sooo natural. * Very easy to use! I literally just used a foundation brush and applied it and it was seamless with no oxidation or cracking. This is coming from someone who has never used foundation before because of how i worried id look a mess later lol. Morphe has yet to let me down * I got this product as a free gift with purchase. I hadn't even considered trying it until I received it as the free gift. I absolutely love the coverage. This is not something I would have tried before as I have not used Morphe foundations. However, the drawback is foundation comes out of the pump and gets on the finger after pushing down. This  creates a mess and then foundation gets everywhere or you have to have something to wipe off the excess that gets on your finger from the pump leaking. * Love it"
88,estÃ©e lauder,double wear sheer long-wear foundation spf 19,pimprod2027234,2586142," * The Estée Lauder Double Wear Sheer Long-Wear Foundation in shade 1W1 Bone has become my go-to for a lightweight, polished everyday look. It offers the perfect amount of sheer coverage to even out my skin tone without feeling heavy or cakey—my skin still looks like skin, just smoother and more radiant.

I love that it lasts all day without oxidizing or sliding off, even in warmer weather. The added SPF 19 is a great bonus for daily sun protection, and the formula plays well with both moisturizers and primers underneath.

If you're looking for a breathable foundation that holds up beautifully while still letting your natural complexion shine through, this is it. A little goes a long way, and the finish is effortlessly beautiful. Total staple in my makeup bag! * I bought this from Ulta and was so excited to try it.
What a disappointment! It was so runny and watery. It didn't really even do anything for my complexion. I've used Double Wear Stay in Place for a long time, and I wanted something lighter for Summer. But this stuff should not even be called a foundation. It's not a skin tint either. For the price point of over $50.00 it was a complete waste of money. * I absolutely love the look & feel of this product. Great for everyday natural & i can build up for more coverage. I set it with the BareMinerals Originial Loose veil setting powder in Translucent. And it lasted the full 12HRs!!!! * This was my favorite foundation for a while now but my shade has dissappeared…really dissappointed. Why is 2N1 just gone? * I've tried three of four BB creams, sheer foundations, etc. Two of which broke me out in hives and one that was just plain awful. I came across this, and figured I'd try it since I like the original Double Wear foundation. I love this! It's lightweight, evens my skin tone, has SPF in it, and has decent coverage. Plus, it does not break me out! Will definitely purchase this again. * This ""foundation"" gives no coverage and it's so watery. I put it on my face and immediately wiped it off. I wanted a lighter feel than double wear foundation but it's horrible. * This foundation is terrible. It has no coverage and never dries. You will walk around sticky all day, which I hate, but you may not mind. It was sticky and wet even after setting with powder. I will be returning it."

WRONG. This is probably the worst product i have ever put on my skin. I prepped my skin, made sure the primer I used had the same base. The second i put it on it legit settled into every pore to the point where it looked like i had foundation colored freckles. I tried applying with a brush, my finger tips, and a beauty blender in different areas to see if that made a difference, but no luck. Will not be buying again. * this has pretty much been my go to rather than foundation; nice even coverage * I really wanted to love this stuff. I'm 60 and really love the poreless primer liquid.  This cc cream is worse than I thought makeup could look. It highlights pores & lines I didn't even know I had.  Very dry & seems to seek out texture imperfections. * I am a makeup minimalist and was excited for this easy coverage. Nope, it leaves a weird cakey texture no matter how well prepped my skin is. * One use and i was icked. It's so thick, and doesnt blend well or look natural. And it was annoying to have to get off my hands. It felt oily on my skin and didnt look natural like something like this should. It looked like i plastered it in my face, and that was just one pump. * Very smooth! I love the color 210 N! It's pretty tan and blends really nicely with a lighter concealer!

Right now, I am in between two colors. One is too dark. The other one is too light. It is buildable and feels nice on my face though. * I have super sensitive skin. This stuff didnt break me out at all. Felt light on my skin. Im in florida so i need something that will cover up. I love it alot. Its not for everyone but i love it. Again my skin is super sensitive so having to go with pricy make up i need to make sure its worth every penny: this stuff is worth every penny. * way too thick, heavy like thick foundation * I really love this foundation as someone with dry skin and getting more fine lines. I kinda forgot about this one because I wore powder foundation for a while and recently switched back to liquid. I really, really love this. It doesnt look cakey, but builds beautifully. I will say i got a teeny bit oily on my forehead, but id rather have a quick fix through the day with powder than have a super dry cakey look. I really recommend this.

It also didnt break apart or separate on my skin. Ill def be using this again. I like this more than my makeup forever hydrating foundation. * I prefer a light and cake free foundation. I was using Jane Iredale but they made a change to their foundation that did not work well for me.  I found this foundation and mix it with Jane Iredale primer to get the perfect consistency and color. * Perhaps it was my fault. I went to Ulta and asked the sales associate to help me find a light tinted moisturizer. This is much too thick and heavy to be that. It looks cakey on my skin, which I didn't realize until I got hom. * Absolutely love this product, it goes on smooth and feels weightless.

Sadly, it was confirmed cakey on me. 🥲 * I was super hesitant to buy since its a moisturizing foundation nc most dont sit well on my oily t-zone! Ive used the double wear and LOVE the longevity of it, but needed something a little less coverage! This was PERFECT and everyrhing I was looking for. Medium coverage, sits flawlessly on my mature skin, and doesnt over hydrate my already oily skin. Finished with a setting powder and ny skin was flawless ALL day. New favorite and staple in my routine!!!! * This foundation is a life changer. When I wear it my skin looks flawless. People tell me how beautiful my skin is. * Very good product.  I am satisfied and staff very knowledgeable about this product. * This foundation is very moisturizing, which is what my skin needs now that I have more mature skin. I recommend this to anyone who needs moisture. * Was not hydrating in my opinion.  Left a dry look finish, had to shake tube well....returned"

Pros: 
color match was good (BD01 is good match for my neutral pale skin. I'm around 13-17 in Korean foundations)
Easy to apply with fingers, not streaky 
Not finicky (doesn't apply nicely one day then horribly the next)
Doesn't get messy when it fades
Looks very natural
When oils breakthrough, it looks glowy rather than greasy

Cons:
Only lasts like 2 hours before starting to fade. Doesn't fade completely until maybe 6 hours though
Longevity doesn't improve much with primer
Not sure if it's caused a small breakout

I'll try a few more days before deciding if I want to return it. I've been looking for a light foundation with skincare I can throw on. I have other foundations I like for long days but still I wish this lasted a bit longer than a few hours, for its price. If I do keep it, I won't repurchase. * I have combo skin (oily t-zone, dry cheeks and chin) and I also have moderate rosacea (reddness and bumps) and it covers my skin like a dream! I've tried many viral foundations and always find myself coming back to this one. I just finished my second bottle and no doubt will be purchasing my third! * Broke the first time I used it. * Blends perfectly. Looks like second skin. A little goes a long way.

I apply the foundation with a damp beauty blender and then apply blush …I very lightly set my forehead, nose, and chin with a setting powder. It lasts all day (15 + hours) and doesn't clog my skin. The color range is really nice! * On my second bottle just a few shades darker after getting tanned because the first one was a lighter shade but the quality is that amazing *chefs kiss* * I've been happy with this until recently. They seem to have changed the shades so ordering my normal one makes me look ghostly. Got one shade darker than normal but the formula is super runny now. * Was looking for Smashbox Studio 24  replacement. This is it!! Love the all day smooth w oil control. I will buy this again 
😊 * Goes on smooth and light and stays put. Definitely a great foundation. * It looked k natural"
95,maybelline,super stay 24h skin tint + vitamin c,pimprod2039657,2610817," * 100000/10 recommend!! I would say I have combo skin more leaning to the dry side. This product is my holy grail. I used a $60 foundation months back and regret paying that money for horrible foundation. This one has never let me down! * The product goes on very easily and leaves an almost instant matt finish, yet still blend-able even after it starts to dry. I have dry skin and even though it dries down almosy instantly, it doesn't feel like it's making my skin feel even more dry and doesn't cling to any dry patches. It does however get into my smile creases, but i have pretty defined lines so that's expected. * My skin is combo mostly dry and this foundation looks gorgeous on my skin. It does not look cakey throught the day and the longevity is good. Highly recommended for people with dry or combo skin. * Goes on smoothly. Perfect balance for my combination skin. Just the right amount of coverage. Highly recommend! * They need more shades but I like the formula. It really sticks to my skin and lasts an 8 hour shift at work. Doesnt feel too heavy or cakey. * I had high expectations for this skin tint seeing all of its glowing reviews. After only using it twice, my skin HATED IT. I started getting little break outs allllll over my skin. Will be returning. ): * I love it, very flawless on the skin, lasts all day and its natural for a natural looking day"
96,l'orÃ©al,true match super-blendable foundation,pimprod2034733,2602421," * I usually exclusively use high end or luxury makeup products, but I've been hearing about this foundation for years now and finally decided to try it. Let me tell you what. I regret not buying it sooner. The coverage and finish is very comparable to my favorite Make Up For Ever HD foundation, and it photographs equally well. The buildable coverage also makes this foundation perfect for underpainting if you're into that. For reference, I am a very dry skin girl and I prep with lots of moisturizer.  It blends into the skin like a dream and works well with all of the other products I've used with it. * Purchased this brand for the first time and it did not disappoint. Decent quality for its price point and I like that you can increase coverage without it feeling caked on. I give this a 7/10 considering price and quality. * I love the product,  it blends in with my skin tone very well. * I was easily influenced by TikTok to buy this foundation and pleasantly surprised that I liked it. I am not much of a foundation wearer but love that this is buildable and it is moisturizing. Did not break me out and there was no unpleasant smell. * I wanted to try this because i saw Shelby Ann from Tiktok using it and thiught id try it out. I love Nars Radiant. I will say to get this foundation to last one and really look good on the skin, you have to prep. 
I use the same routine as Shelby. 
Milk toner
Elf glow drops
However i have used recently: milk toner,elf power grip primer, elf glow sunscreen, and then apply foundation, 
I really does look like a filter. Love it. * The color match was great and the texture was very light but it was very drying and after just one wear my skin broke out :( if you have sensitive/ combo or dry skin I would not recommend * This product gives good coverage without looking heavy"
97,estÃ©e lauder,double wear stay in place matte powder foundation refill,pimprod2031253,2593713," * I love this foundation. I first tried the stay wear liquid but I found that I like the stay wear powder foundation better. I have combination skin with hormonal acne and it doesn't aggravate my acne at all. I usually just get a under the skin bump or two on my chin a week before my cycle and this foundation doesn't make it worse or aggravate it in any way. I don't have any injections or fillers and I have some fine lines and it doesn't sit in those lines making me look older so I definitely like that. I take good care of my skin and  believe in aging gracefully. I know I am getting older and the wrinkles are coming but thats okay with me. My smile lines are from the wonderful smiles and laughs I've had and I wear them proudly. I eat a healthy diet, workout every morning and I only drink water and my skin reflects that and looks healthy. Just because we age doesn't mean we won't look good anymore. Healthy, glowing skin is beautiful at any age in my opinion. So, I use this powder foundation all year round and I definitely recommend using a good primer for your skin type before applying this foundation. It definitely keeps it looks good thru your work day. I use to solely use Clinique and I still use their eye shadow, mascara, blush and skincare but I had a good friend introduce me to this foundation and I literally ran out to get it lol. Just remember every day you wake up is a gift and a chance to shine :) * Once I apply Esstee's  Double wear foundation I use her compact powder to set the foundation.  It is a perfect complement to the foundation. * Love products * I wear 1c1 in winter but 2c1 in summer,I love how easy it is to change out shades with these refills. It's a wonderful, flexible formula that's never cakey. * I buy ivorynude (one if the lightest shades).The color mathecs perfects, at first. However, with a couple hours, my makeup looks a couple shades darker. I have worn this on my tropical vacations and it holds against water, still looking perfect. If you buy a couple shades lighter, it may work for you. * Love the smooth look 👌 * I am 47 with normal to dry skin. Full coverage long lasting!"
98,dior,forever natural nude foundation,pimprod2036826,2604394," * This foundation is amazing..it's as if the Forever Matte and Glow had a baby.  It gives such a beautiful satin finish that is not too matte and not too glowy just perfect. I will definitely buy this again and I've recommended it to quite a few of my friends and they love it as well! * I have been trying to decide why I am not reaching for this foundation and I have come to the conclusion I may have gotten an old bottle. The texture is thick and gel like; not what I would expect from a ""nude natural"" foundation. Looks cakey. and when I shake it I don't hear or feel any movement in the bottle. It doesn't really smell spoiled although it does have a fragrance as Dior does. I have tried thinning it out with oil or moisturizer but then it doesn't dry down as it should. I am disappointed but don't know if it's actually the product or that I received  an old bottle. Unfortunately I tossed the box. It's not impossible as I have received  expired products from the warehouse on a couple of other occasions. But I have definitely had better foundations that cost less. * I was not wowed by this foundation. maybe my color match wasn't the best. I am fair to light with a neutral leaning slightly warm complexion and I don't think there is a great match for me in this product. I did not find this product to look very natural or give me any sort of radiance. I felt it looked semi matte rather than a natural finish. Coverage was fine-light to medium as expected. I much prefer Chanel's Healthy Glow foundation. I have mature skin and think perhaps this foundation is better suited to a younger customer. I didn't dislike it but I would not repurchase it. For me it looked rather flat no matter how I prepped my skin. * This is a fantastic foundation! It's lightweight and  leaves me looking naturally flawless. I will say it doesn't completely cover dark spots/acne but I am personally fine with that- nothing a little concealer can't help with. I will definitely be repurchasing. * Wonderful product! * This is the best foundation that I have tried in at least the last 5 years of searching for ""the one"".  Not too heavy or too light. Not cakey and does not settle into my fine lines. This foundation lasts throughout the workday and well into the evening. Definitely worth the price. Finally!  I've found the one!! * Here's a quick review you can use for Dior foundation at Ulta:

""I absolutely love how smooth the Dior foundation applies to my skin! It blends effortlessly, giving me a flawless finish that feels lightweight yet provides great coverage. The formula feels luxurious, and it lasts all day without creasing or feeling heavy. Whether you're going for a natural look or building it up for full glam, this foundation is a game-changer. Highly recommend trying it out—you won't be disappointed!"""
99,mac,studio radiance serum powered foundation,pimprod2040797,2613967," * The product is great, but it was really Miguel, the Ulta consultant, who made the experience memorable and assured I would come back and purchase again. Even though it wasn't his primary product area, he spent the time to find just the right foundation color , talk about the benefits of other MAC products and how they work together and was very informative, but not high pressure. He is the reason I will return! * I love this foundation. It has just the right coverage, covers flaws without looking cakey. Gives me an all day glow that looks totally natural. * Love love love this foundation! It's light weight, not a true mat but doesnt make me look shiny. It's buildable, lasts all day and the perfect match. * I swear its been YEARS to find a good base. 

YES the colors aren't solid and theres mot much variation BUT with concealer you add dimension and you're good go! 

I work in a kitchen over steaming soup pots and SWEAR on this!

Its hard ti find something that will stay all day in steam and sweat . ALSO glsses! A life saviour! Cant believe it took me this long to get into MAC. * As an older woman. My skin has changed. This product gives a smooth,  clean result. Great color match. * I sat with the MAC rep and we re-did ALL the foundations and powders for the winter! * Love this foundation …especially in the fall & winter. When skin tends to be drier!!"

I didn't feel like the color was great at matching and I didn't feel like it really smooth my skin or covered my pores. It also made my skin feel very dry. * O like this product but still looking to see if there is anything else better for my aging oily skin. When I sweat at work and face starts to get oily a few hours before I go home * I have tried way too many cream, liquid, and powder foundations and keep going back to this one. I have been using for years. Even good for mature skin. * 12+ hours of coverage, that will hold up in humid summer Weather, this is my tried & true. Matte. Buildable formula, versatile, light handed with a fluffy brush or pack on with puff for more coverage. On  ""dry"" days, mist with a hydrating spray. * I was looking for something to replace my beloved elf camo powder foundation after they discontinued it but this one is not it. The coverage is nonexistent, and texture is just chalky. Wish i could return but sadly tried too long to make it work and missed the return window. * not a good product for those with large pores or any texture. also wears off so quick"

I'm in my 40s and useless daily. Ladies in our 40s, please don't forget to use setting spray to set the powder so it does not look Cakey or dry. * I have been using this powder foundation for a few months now, and while sometimes it's tricky to find the right primer to put underneath it. I do like it overall. It has a good medium coverage and sits well on my skin. I have combination skin, oily in the t zone, dry on the cheeks. I feel that it blends in with my skin well and while I don't think it lasts 18 hours, I do feel like it lasts almost all day with very minimal touchup.. * Love it! * This was my first time using one of the Tarte foundations and this one did not work for me. I have combination normal/oily skin and this just made my skin very oily and break out. I did return it and switch back to my normal brand * Love Tarte products * Only powder I will ever use!

Most foundations don't work well with moisturizers and cause separation but not this brand. It melts nicely and looks like skin! And no heaviness * This is a very natural looking foundation.  Although extremely lightweight, it covers amazingly well.  Be careful when applying because it is very watery, but once it sets it gives a nice natural coverage. * I got shade 2, and it pulls WAY too yellow; I looked like I was having kidney failure. I couldn't even focus on the finish or feel because it looked insane. I was really bummed because I've waited years to try this foundation. * This foundation is very ""watery"" which I was warned of but it doesn't bother me and it goes on nicely. The coverage is light but buildable. My skin is prone to oxidizing foundations terribly and this is the best foundation I have found that doesn't oxidize as bad as others on my skin. * this is an amazing foundation. the only con is the bottle. it WILL squirt all over you if you are running low so DO NOT apply in your going out outfit. it stains your clothes * This product has such a light consistency, ince it dries down its like wearing nothing. Lovely medium coverage that can be built upon. Makes skin look perfected and lasts all day * This is such a beautiful foundation. It give enough to cover redness and uneven tones but still looks natural and not heavy. You dont even know you have anything on. Beautiful for mature skin."

I bought the Dior foundation and still try to use my hourglass one even though theres barely product left * I ordered this product twice and returned. Both times the foundation stick was found upside down.  The stick was no longer attached to the base but had detached and was in the cap. There was no way to use this product. * I used the foundation stick manay years ago and was obsessed with the seemless coverage; however, this is not the same foundation stick. They must have changed the formula bc it goes onto your skin terribly and looks cakey, cracked immediately upon application. Ive tried four different types of primer as well as none at all and I still am left with the same look. Do not waste your money. * She went on so nicely, that at first, I was obsessed. That quickly dissipated as I wore her throughout the day. She broke apart, leaving a weird finish on skin. It still looked ok from afar but the moment you got close it was a disaster. I tried and tried again. I thought maybe it's my sunscreen, my serum, my moisturizer. But no matter what I switched out, the same thing happened - goes on great and breaks apart in an hour or two. I returned her :( * I have oily/combo acne prone skin. This product is great on my oily sections and provides a full coverage. It has an insane amount of product, I have used a lot of it and ive had it for over a year yet still have half. It can cling to my pimples a little bit but as i wear it through the day it blends into it. * I have used Hourglass (which I prefer) as well as IT Cosmetics and both have changed the description for their products (from a name to a number and vice versa). I have a number on my Hourglass stick and unfortunately can't reorder online. So frustrating!
IT doesn't even have the description on the product so that sealed the deal for them. Makes no sense why they make it so hard for the consumer. * Good color match and formula. Problem packaging, amount of product, and price. The product was stuck to the cap. I was able to get the product out and place it in a tiny jar. Packaging needs redesign for the price. Can't recommend for this reason."
105,wyn beauty,featuring you hydrating skin enhancing tint spf 30,pimprod2044322,2622290," * Not buying at least 3 bottles in my shade. Now it's sold out. So far, I have enjoyed the coverage on the areas on my face that I'm self conscious about for almost a ""no makeup "" look. It does have a slight smell but nothing too major. The one I bought did have an exp date of 11/25/25, but I haven't had any adverse reactions * I feel this is a truly underrated product. It mixes so good with my foundation and enhances it. I use Estee Lauder Double Wear and il Makiage. I hope this stays on the market. It is a truly great product. You can use it alone and it gives you a natural no makeup finish with a slightly dewy glow. * This blends well with my foundation. It creates such a beautiful velvet finist. The foundation I use il makiage or Estee Lauder double wear. I truly feel this is an underrated product. I use it almost everyday and I love it. Cannot live without it. * Tried but the texture was horrible on my skin. Yea i tend to have dryer skin but i would prime my skin and still if would get sooo cake like . Awful * I love skin tint, this is the opposite of what good skin tint is. it's oily, separates, sticks to dry patches and feels heavy on the skin. I'm sorry I wanted to like it. the pro is nice packing * This is actually very nice. I have a pretty spot on shade match. Very lightweight, comfortable and moisturizing on the face. Pretty glowy so if you prefer a matte skin tint stay away (also if you have very sensitive skin, this may cause itching and breakouts cause the formula is expiring) but the finish is very natural/everyday friendly. I was shocked at the coverage. Can definitely be built up to a medium coverage. Love that theres spf in there and wears surprisingly well. Lasts through my workdays and under the sun while driving. I like the packaging, i think its fun. I take concealer too seriously to try the concealer but this is great for under $10. I enjoy this for basic mundane days where i dont want to use up my nicer product but want to look put together * This product doesn't blend well into skin no matter how well I prep my skin! Gives a very patchy and dry look."
106,hourglass,ambient soft glow foundation,pimprod2033509,2599657," * I wasnt all that jazzed about this foundation at first. I am 51 years old with combination skin and i have been on a years long mission to find a foundation that worked well with my skin. Most foundation looks great when you first put it on, but for me, it starts slipping around as the day goes on and ends up a mess by the end of the day. When I first tried this, it looked a bit cakey and clung to the dry patches on my face, but it didnt move…at all.  Then I tried applying less- like not even a quarter of a pump. That was the ticket! Perfect coverage, no cakiness, and it doesnt budge - all day long. It doesnt feel like anything on my skin. 

Not every product works for every skin type  but this is IT for me! * I really wanted to love this foundation. I love the color match and coverage, however three days in and I noticed acne ALL OVER MY FACE. So sad!!! * I have tried everything out there. Finally found this gem. Looks so natural complexion looks flawless. Light weight. I have mature skin and have lots of spots covers great with little color correction. Little expensive but a little goes a long way. Definitely worth a try * It clung to every dry patch no matter how much I prepped and it separated. * I don't usually write reviews, but I felt like I had to this time—just to give some insight before you spend your money on this foundation.

First off, I LOVE Hourglass. I've been obsessed with their concealers—they've been my go-to for so long—so I really thought I'd love their foundation too… but sadly, I was super disappointed. This foundation is not it.

For reference, I've used Estée Lauder and thought it was decent, but I was still curious to try this one. I always prep my skin well, but even with that, this foundation went on patchy and came off so easily. Ijust didn't sit right. I've never had this issue with my past foundations. Like… what?? 😩

Just wanted to share my experience in case it helps any of you. If you're looking for a reliable, everyday foundation, I honestly don't think this one is worth the price. :( * For context, I have combo to oily skin. I tried this foundation for two weeks. No matter what prep I did, no matter what I set it with, it highlighted every pore and line on my face. It looked cakey and greasy (I used less than 1 pump). It does provide good coverage, and it doesn't feel heavy on the skin. Just didn't work for me. * I had an appointment in the salon for formal makeup for a masquerade ball, and the artist doing my makeup pulled out this brand to use and it was the most perfect shade match Ive ever seen for my skin, I went and bought it immediately"

My daughter found this for me and so far i absolutely love it. The color match is perfect.  It goes on so soft and smooth and there is not a weird or strong smell. * Good coverage. * The first time gave me a rash so I waited a couple of months to make sure it was this and I tried it again and gave a red bumps all over my face. I'm not the only one. There's a lot of bad reviews w the same effect. * Excellent powder foundation for older women.  I don't know why my color doesn't seem to be available anymore though.  What's going on with the limited shade offerings?  Fenty still has all 50 shades on their website! * Ive been using this powder in shade 150 since it came out. All of a sudden theres no lighter shades? Not even one around the color ive been using. I've probably went through 10 of these compacts, and am beyond disappointed. Def gives me the ick for the brand!! * Perfect match for my skin tone. * I did the color match online and they matched me with a Shane that is not even available anymore. At the store I matched with 210 and the consultant said they are not going to carry that shade anymore. why would this supposedly inclusive brand cut all these different shades from their lineup? Now I guess I have to find another brand to buy powder from."
109,covergirl,simply ageless skin perfector essence foundation,pimprod2042952,2618803," * I had high hopes based on feedback from friends, but the product arrived very runny - it was like water and the beige liquid separated and would not blend well together even after I pumped the product onto my hand. I wish I had brought the product into the store for a refund. * If you're a fan of the Chanel Water Fresh Tint $70, then you should definitely try this. Coverage is identical but price difference makes it oh so much better. * i kinda want to gate keep and keep this gem to myself but omg this is amazing on the skin. I have the Chanel les beige tint and this is so comparable. I love it!!!!!!! Please dont ever discontinue * I bought this because I heard it was a dupe for a high end brand.  At first i didnt really care for this foundation but im almost done with the bottle and now I really like it.  I like that its lightweight, hydrating, leaves skin plump and healthy. It also evens out skintone and stays in through the day.  You do have to work it into the skin a little bit to get a even application because of foundation droplets. I like to use a flat (round)foundation brush. Its a very light foundation .. maybe even a skin tint.  Works wells with creams and powders.  I like mixing in some bronzing drops while applying. * I would have given this a higher rating, but this foundation irritated my skin. It made it dry, and small bumps started to appear, as well as making my pores appear larger.  Which is too bad; I would have liked this otherwise.  The first time I applied it, it evened out my blotchiness without having a thick layer of makeup on my skin, but my skin texture got progressively worse every day I wore this makeup.  So, it's not for me. * I love this stuff! Helps even out my skin tone, and for acne I spot conceal. Lasts all day for me (with setting powder and spray) and it feels so lightweight. I like this better then any high end product. * nothing ive used gives the same best-skin finish without looking like im wearing makeup. It also pairs well with all types of concealers, cheek and powder products. 

I know it's a bit expensive for cover girl but this formula is really excellent, and I like it better than what its duping bc it has zero scent. Also a bottle last 8-10months if used everyday. Just need small little dots for a naturally perfect skin look.

Keep this one around Cover Girl!"

They're all a little too orange. * I will definitely buy it again. * Smooth and even application, blends nicely * I tried four shades in this product and none worked.

I'm very pale, but not ailing Victorian child pale. I also have a pink-ish undertone, and that makes it near impossible to find a light color that doesn't make me look like I've been drained of all blood. This stuff is thick, doesn't mix well, and cakes on. I've tried it with primers, moisturizers, thinning it out, using less, using more, setting sprays and powders. The color is off, and there doesn't seem to be an acceptable shade for me, but that aside, the product is just not good. I bought it because of the great reviews, and I'm stoked for those who love it (jealous, even), but this just wasn't for me. I wouldn't deter anyone from trying it, but I wouldn't recommend it, either. I'm still playing with it to see if I can figure out how to make it work for me, but I'm close to giving up. Make of this review what you will. * I absolutely love this. Bought it on a whim and so happy I did. I have combination skin but mostly dry on my T-Zone and this leaves such a gorgous natural finish. However, this is very light coverage. If you're looking for something with more coverage I would not recommend. * I have 56 year old sensitive skin with  some discoloration/visible pores. This foundation gives me a slightly glowy, smooth but natural finish, with medium coverage using 2 pumps of product. I use the UV essential SPF underneath, then use this by applying to the back of my hand, and breaking up the pigments with fingers or brush before application. I will repurchase, even with the premium price, as there is no  comparable product in the market. Also, the shades with B are the neutrals, BR is cooler (r is for rose) and BD are warmer or more golden (dore.) This can be used a spot cover or all over foundation. The included small brush is nice, but only usable under the eyes, or in small areas. I use a larger, dense brush for all over application. the bottle lasts (for me) 4-5 months. * Its natural and mekts into my skin it dont even look like im wearing make up. Im caramel tan and b50 is a perfect match * I discovered this at the airport. Tried it on but didn't purchase it right then. I got to my gate and as I'm waiting for boarding I looked in the mirror by the window in natural daylight, it was flawless! I had to have it lol. So I walked/ran a 30 minute round trip back to the duty free from my gate to get this! That's how much I loved it. I've had it 2 months now, i wear it nearly every day and I'm about halfway through the bottle, a little goes a long way with this. Even though it's a thin consistency you think you need more, you really don't. (I'm 50 btw) * The best foundation i have ever tried for my 40 year old skin! This smooths over absolutoly everything from acne scars to fine lines to big pores, and it is seemless and understandable on the skin. It doesnt sit on top of skin or add any texture. I hope Chanel keeps this forever!! 

I tried water tint and it's fine. I feel like it performs like many other tints and makes me look greasy. This newer touch one leaves me flawless! I've gone theough hundreds of foundations looking for this effect. I love this so much. I get compliments everytime I wear it. Never discontinue! * Finding a water based foundation is difficult. I stumbled across this foundation about a year ago and have used it ever since. In the beginning I had some trouble getting it to look good on my skin. I realized I had to MIX till it was uniform and then put it on. With a powder on top it looks decent, it's thin and non blurring so my texture shows just a little bit. It's been workable, it doesn't break me out and it being water based helps keep my grease prone skin in check.  I am falling out of love with it recently. The most recent bottle feels different in some way. It feels greasier. I look pasty and it gives me uncanny valley vibes. I am pretty pale, but not sickly looking like this foundation shows me to be. At the price tag, I don't care to go and buy another shade. It has been my go to for so long but I am ready to branch out to other water based skin tints. I'm sure this works for people so I'm not going to say I don't recommend it, I am not offended that after a year it stopped working for me. It's thin, but will quickly build and be cakey if you put too much on. It's not something I could ever put on my skin without powder to set it."
115,juvia's place,i am magic velvety matte foundation,pimprod2006831,2550494," * Been ising it for about 5 yrs now * This is the first foundation that blends well on my skin tone. * Have been using this foundation since 2021 (I think) I immediately fell in love with it, but since I am a makeup lover I still bought other trendy foundations to just try out and have before quickly realizing that NOTHING will ever beat this foundation, it has been over 4 years and this is still the only thing I will ever be putting on my face! Right now I have 3 back up foundations and anytime it's on sale I buy more just in case. If you don't like full glam makeup stay away, the coverage on this is insane. My biggest fear is this foundation or my shade getting discontinued because I will actually go feral and probably try and protest in front of the Juvia's place office. 10/10 that is all. * This foundation is so full coverage, but it still looks so natural on the skin. It mixes well with a lighter or darker pigment to customize tour shade, and it lasts beautifully. Absolutely worth the prize, because you only need just a little to get a face full of coverage. * I've wanted to try Juvia's foundation for a long time and finally did. In choosing the best shade, I purchased three colors (510, 435, 440) to mix and match and that worked well. It's full coverage which I love! A little goes a long way. I do recommend that you use a good primer first. * This foundation is perfect. It has a full coverage with a flawless finish. There are many colors to choose from. I have tried low priced brands and high priced brands, but I extremely happy with this one. I have brought it again and again. * This is the perfect make up for me !! I have been using it for about 5 years.  Nothing else that I tried gave me the results as this make up.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who is not an every day makeup wearer."

I like a multi-tasking products. * I LOVE this foundation. Perfect Match. I heard it was discontinued and was so bummed. But it isn't!!! Thank goodness!! Here it is. I have an extremely hard time finding a match for my pale skin. Thank you soooo much! Buyer for life.. * Great makeup either an older people like me and they're 60s covers blemishes and age spots pretty well * Honestly it's pretty great! Color matched perfect and the application feels more like foundation w/ light coverage. I apply it with a beauty blender, finish with Elf hi-Def setting powder and I'm out the door! Try it for yourself :) * For a long time, instead of using foundation I used either Shape Tape or Born This Way where I need it most and would just blend it out onto my moisturizer.  This summer I developed some really bad sunspots and no matter how much corrector/concealer I'd use, my skin would look grey where the sun spots were.  One day, I tried this because I had gotten a sample and omg it has saved me!  I finally felt comfortable going out again without thinking everyone was staring at me.  The weird part was, it wasn't as heavy or full coverage as my concealer but worked 100x better.  Well, I'm finally at the end of that little tube and also, I now need a lighter color, so here I am.  

This CC cream is better than any other I've tried, it somehow has great coverage but looks incredibly soft and natural.  I'm also able to use it where I need it without seeing lines of demarcation.  This is most definitely an unsung hero and I'm baffled as to how it doesn't have a better rating. * I came in today looking for the tarte BB cream, but saw the cloud CC cream and went with it instead.  It matched well, covered great & has a light feel.  However, I got home and went on the tarte website only to discover it's already been discontinued.  😩 WHY?!? * I love Tarte. Not my favorite foundation, but its great for every day or summertime."
118,exa,high fidelity foundation,pimprod2019009,2573283," * ECSTATIC IN AN UNDERSTATMENT!!! I have been searching for a foundation like this for YEARSSS. (I have super sensitive combo skin leaning dry. Liquid foundations always look terrible on me after 1 hour. I do great skin prep too!) Lightweight, breathable foundation, quality ingredients, minimal ingredients, fragrance free, light to medium coverage, skin like finish, 6 to 8 hour wear still looking flawless, doesnt dry my skin out, doesnt irritate my skin, doesnt cling to dry patches, COLOR MATCH ON POINT, skincare ingredients, AFFORADABLE, anti-pollution (I live in SLC, worst air quality/pollution here) I  literally cried when i first put this foundation on i was so blown away at how perfect it was. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NEVER EVER discontinue or reformulate. I am a customer for life and this foundation has changed my life. * very skin like finish! no fuss foundation. * This is an undetectable foundation on my mature, dry skin, though it can build easily for extra coverage. I will just add additional drops on those darker spots, which still peek through but look more homogenous. But coverage is not my main concern, so this winner maintains the slightly dewy glow over a well -prepped skin base, still looking un made-up by the end of the day. Also, goes over mineral sunscreen flawlessly. IMO it is on par with Haus Labs, Nars Radiant LIght, MUF reboot; my other favs. I am trying another shade, though am happy with Katey, the match I found via the skin models- so that's my recommendation for finding your shade, rather than the description. It is on sale, so... TRY IT! * I'm assuming this foundation is on clearance because of quality issues… I received my order and the formula is completely separated and cannot be mixed back together to a good consistency. * I was so surprised when i first used it, my skin looked like skin. I like a lightweight natiral finish and this gives me exactly that! It also stays on all day/night, only thing is that it oxidizes a little bit but not wnything drastic. Has been my go-to foundation for over a year already! * good match for hard shade (fair/light olive) and good for sensitive/acne prone/scar/texture skin. decent coverage but feels light and natural. but doesnt really set (makeup smudges on my cat) & taking the top off pulls the entire pump out sometimes * I have used this foundation for a few years and it's never let me down. I fluctuate between a range of their lighter, cool toned shades depending on the time of year. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. A few things I've learned along the way: 

*A thin base layer will cover most spots and uneven tones. If you need more coverage, then spot treat with a little more foundation.
*It pairs beautifully on top of Nudestix tinted sunscreen.
*Applies well with brushes or sponges, but better with your fingers.
*A stippling, dabbing motion is the best method to apply the thin layers.

I'm 41, and I receive many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation, and I feel like I look more youthful with this on. I will definitely continue to repurchase!"

So, I had to find something else and decided to try Bare Minerals.The applicator was weird to start with - kind of jagged. The formula was very thick and sat on top of my skin. It never fully blended in and I looked like I was in the circus with cakey makeup. I returned it. * This is an amazing product. I was so happy to find something I really loved. Wirked great with my skin. But, now they no longer make my shade. Guess I have to find something else… Sucks! I Really loved this product. * I usually get the Bare Pro, but on a recommendation by a consultant at Ulta, I tried the serum. I am 50 and my skin is changing. This one is good for light coverage and is has a nice sheen to it that makes your skin look fresh. I will continue to use the Bare Pro for days that I want more coverage. But the serum is a nice change. * This product is somehow dry and greasy-looking at the same time... and  it was so runny I found it hard to work with. It has poor coverage and no matter what I tried I could not get it to stop settling/separating and emphasizing lines and texture. It looked so bad I had to return it. * Almost $150 later the products that the associate picked out for me via the description I gave her was the absolute opposite when I got home and tried it on my face for work and I am a general manager and customer service very dissatisfied. * I recently had an associate at Ulta help me select a new foundation. I told her I had mature oily skin and I wanted a lightweight foundation with sunscreen. She picked this Bare Minerals serum foundation and put a small sample on my face. Honestly, it looked pretty nice in the store but by the time I got home the product had settled into every fine line, wrinkle, and pore. I thought it was just because I hadn't put a primer on and decided to keep trying at home. NOPE -- still horrible in every way possible. To make it worse, the cap doesn't come off easily, and in my efforts to twist and turn it off, I accidentally loosened the lid and foundation went flying EVERYWHERE. Took forever to clean it off counters and mirrors because it just smeared. Horrible product and packaging. I don't know how anyone can successfully wear or even use this product. * I love bare minerals and have used the original loose powder foundation but it wasn't sitting right on minute skin anymore so thoigh I would try the serum foundation.  Still did not work well with my dry skin. I will be returning"

Primer, no primer, powder, setting spray, regardless of how I prep the skin this foundation does not last (I always do skin prep of course). Im not sure how this foundation has such a high rating, it's absolutely horrible and my skin isnt even that finicky. I have some minor blemish hyperpigmetation in my 30 year okd skin and some fine lines because we're all human. It breaks down, looks patchy, unblended and extremely cakey. 0/10 would not recommend. I never have done a review on a makeup product before because I can usually make it work to some degree, but I had to do a review on this one because its SO bad. * This item size is NOT worth the money. This is only .3 of an oz in size. This size is good if someone wants to try it out and wants to spend that money for it. This bottle will not last but maybe 3-4 full applications if that, for reference. I should have just bought the full size. * I ordered this on a sale where you buy one mini and get one free. They only sent me one and then when I contacted them refused to give me what I payed for. When I ordered it showed the buy one get two free in my cart. I wouldn't have paid this much money for one mini! I don't know if I will keep shopping at Ulta. I am seeing better deals other places and have spent so much money here when other places have bigger bottles for cheaper. * I'm very impressed with this product. The coverage is excellent but it feels very light on the skin. * I love Tarte  especially the shape tape foundation and concealer. I have used this in the past no problem,  this time it seemed dry and thick. I looked it up manufacturing date,  over six years ago! I don't understand why all Ulta is selling such old products?  I'm actually afraid to shop there now. * Color was too dark but that was my error in choosing the shade; however, the product is heavy and very shiny * Cheaper alternative but works amazing"

This glides on easily, nice coverage and leave my skin with dewy and seamless finish * Oxidizes red * I dont love the brand for what they did but i wanted to try them for myself honestly its tricky product cause its really only performed well on bare face with no  skincare no primers or it looks terrible but after a few days of using it every day it gave me deep under the skin pianful cystic acne since its the only product on my face im using i know its her * I am 54 years old.

I dont hate it but i likely wont buy it again. * Not bad but not so good * I am 34 with combination/oily skin. I was looking for a lighter feeling foundation that wasn't full, cakey coverage but still covered redness and imperfections. With oily skin, finding something that doesn't slide right off my face like an oil slick is tough. This is perfect!! I do my skincare as normal, do one spritz of mattifying spray before adding foundation, and this lasts allllllll day. My first touch up is 10 hours into my day. This has become my new go to for work days. * This beautiful formula has made it so i dont have to pay a ton for the high end foundations I was using! Perfect for a night out or everyday! * I love how this looks on my 51 year old face. I found it searching for a medium coverage foundation, though it does lean closer to full coverage. It is VERY hard to tell what color is in the bottle, there are no descriptions of the colors at ULTA, you have to look on line. I wish there were testers in store! Otherwise, I love it! * Having mixed skin. I prepped my skin before using this product & noticed the foundation would cling & look like it was peeling. I tried without prepping & looks good at first & gets bad as it sets. I personally didn't have a good experiencex * This is absolutely gorgeous when first applied. It goes on like a dream and the shade range is great. The shade match is the best I've ever found.

Unfortunately, after 4-5 hours of wear, it gathers in the creases at the side of my nose and slips off my face, no matter what primer I use or how good my setting spray is. I really wish it performed better, because it would be my HG if it did."

It's a great value and applies easily with a sponge, brush, or fingers. Also, I have super dry skin in the winter, and it doesn't flake! * I have used this product since i was 16. Its got amazing coverage, and when i had acne it didn't accentuate it one bit. Now that Im in my mid 20s i still reach for it, it doesnt feel heavy and it lasts me all day. It has to do with technique too, on any foundation tbh, I prefer to build and blend until I get it just right. I love the applicator too. * I started using this foundation in 2022 and havent used a different once since! With acne (cystic) it easily applies and as long as you dont touch your face too much it lasts for hours! This product seriously changed my life. (I pair it with the Glow Watermelon moisturizer as a primer/base) . * When i applied it looked a little too pink for me, by the end of the day it got very cake-y and had gone very orange. I loved the price and texture at first but I think I will be stickinh with my tarte for now."

And concealer underneath is a must. * The online shade matching tool didnt work out well for me. Theres a very yellowish tint. That being said, the actual product is fine, feels lightweight enough. Landed up using a tan setting powder to offset the yellowness. * Very liquid consistency. I found it hard to blend since it stuck to dry patches and seemed to catch and pill. Not much coverage either. * I was looking for light coverage with SPF at Ulta. One of the employees put the product on me and it actually looks OK in store. I should've walked around and then rechecked it because it separates and is cakey on some areas of my face. I've made sure my face was clean/dry/smooth (I've done both laser, hair removal and electrolysis). I tried applying with a sponge, my fingers and with a brush. It always turned out terribly. The liquid is quite thin and leaks immediately when you open the top. So if you are not careful it will spill. I didn't even make it halfway through before giving up and throwing it away. What a waste of money. * Love this moisturizing skin tint.  And I love that its light as I'm not a foundation girl * Nice tint that provides godo coveragd.

I'm almost 40 and sadly it's not as easy as it used to be to do full face without creases. Going to try again with a hydrating or blur primer. * The foundation oxidizes pretty badly. I am very pale, and got 710 because it was the lightest shade in my undertone, and after the foundation oxidizes, it is about 3 shades too dark for me. The only way I have found that I am able to use it is if I mox it with the I Am Magic Concealer in the shade J24, and apply with a VERY light hand to apply the foundation (less than half a pump for the full face).

as for the finish, I find it to be quite beautiful on my dry skin, although I haven't been able to find a primer that I like that also works well with it. that said, with my usual skin prep, this foundation seems to be fine with skipping the primer. I usually set it with Urban Decay All Nighter spray. 

I probably will not rebuy it once I run out of it, but I will probably use it until it eother expires or I run out, whichever is sooner. * Its good just oxidation is the main problem it says natural radiance but it's literally just a dewy full coverage foundation its only good if u mix it in with another foundation * Dry Skin, Sensitive and Light to Medium Skintone w/ a golden undertone. Color Match Alexandria. No filter on my photo and had to use very little foundation. The color was light at first but, then settled into a beautiful tone. No breakouts. * Love the coverage, the buildability, the light feel, and the long wear. My complexion changes with the seasons, but I can depend on this foundation to give me a natural look. I can rely on this foundation for a dewy look without looking too shiny or having issues with the color oxidizing over time. * This foundation has the most amazing  beautiful and radiant finish The coverage is easily buildable and its very creamy for those with dry skin Skin looks amazing after application but it's very short lived This foundation oxidizes sooo badly and almost right away Within an hour my skin looks super orange and it's also separates pretty badly as well leaving my face looking terrible Sadly I will not repurchase"

I live in Jackson, MS and this stays on all day in the sum
mer. * I saw a couple of online reviews recommending this, but my expectations were low considering the price point. I was surprised by how smooth and flawless my skin looked! I'm definitely a skincare rule-follower, so my skin was well prepped by my normal routine (exfoliation, moisturizer, primer). I didn't test the 16 hour claims, but I can attest to 7 or 8 hours of flawless looking skin.  It does have a little bit of scent, but that seemed to fade pretty quickly. * Easy to apply, it gives you medium coverage that looks like your skin. It's matte and perfect fie combo skin. Everything sits beautifully on top of the foundation. Its a great product for the price. * I found this powder foundation online and wanted to give it a try. I used the color chart online and it said I needed the color Vanilla, but upon trying it, turned out to be VERY light and also not really a foundation. I exchanged the Vanilla color for 2 shades darker and it's much better now. I use this as a powder to very lightly cover my face at the end of my makeup application. Feels soft and stays put. Happy with my purchase and I expect this to last me a long long time. Thanks, Ulta!!!"

The cream to powder is perfect, its so lightweight and you can make the coverage as light or full as you want. It bkends like a dream and the color match was spot on. Would definitely recommend! * I absolutely love the cream to powder foundation. It provides full coverage but doesn't feel heavy on the skin. I would buy over and over again. * I have been wanting to try this foundation for a while,  as I love some of the other Milani products, but one of the drawbacks is it can only be purchased online. I finally ordered it and it's ok. I took a quiz to see which color I should order since I've never ordered it before. Again it's only available online, so I can't go test the shades in the store. I am usually an ivory shade in other brands so I got the 220 creamy natural. When it came in, my first reaction was ""oh no"" my fear of ordering the wrong shade came true as the foundation looked really dark and orange. Since I already had it, I decided to test it anyway knowing full well it would not match, but it sort of did end up matching. The dark orange color was just like a film and it was lighter underneath and it blends really well. It feels really lightweight and breathable. It almost feels like you aren't even wearing make up, which makes sense since I found it to be very light coverage. I was hoping for medium to full coverage, but it just evened my skin out like a BB cream would do. I would still recommend it for the price, but wouldn't compare it to the KVD as that's how it was promoted to me. * I took the shade match quiz, the shade was way too light and when applied looks cakey and clings to dry patches. * I got this foundation in the lightest shade and its still too dark and orange. It cakes extremely bad even with two lifht layers. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone! * The cream-to-powder formula is fantastic! I use it alone (no concealer, highlighter, bronzer, blush) and it works great to cover up my acne scars and even out my complexion. However, I have noticed that it breaks me out really badly. I wish there was a clean formula for this type of product. * Right texture for me"

I can't feel the product on my face, it just feels like part of my skin care routine. it also contains SPF which is a huge plus as well. wears perfectly all day long without making me greasy at all, which tends to happen with all foundations I've tried. this covers all my redness which is exactly what I need. no breakouts and no scent. please never stop making this! * It was on clearance and I see why.

It did not take long for it to form cysts. * now that I'm in my 40s, my skin is changing. it's more dry and my pores are bigger, in addition to having discoloration from previous years of tanning and no SPF. I was looking for something very lightweight that I can't feel, that contains SPF and also evens out my skin tone while adding some glow. a tall order, but this product full the bill in full! I tried it without putting on moisturizer first, and I wouldnt recommend that. it wasn't quite moisturizing enough to stand on its own for me. so if you are drier, definitely moisturize first then apply right away. the glow is beautiful but not at all greasy. it blended right in with no tool needed, and my cream blush went on over it perfectly. didn't feel heavy at all either. in fact I forgot id put it on at all after a half hour or so. it evened out my skin tone beautifully while allowing my freckles to show through a little too. love it! * Goes on great! Even skin tone without looking like you are wearing too much makeup. * I love this product. It's light weight. It has a natural glow. You can wear it alone. I top it with a pressed powder foundation. I like that it has SPF coverage in it. It works good for my oily/combo skin. You just need to set it well with a good pressed powder. * Goes on nice and light like a bb , also fades quite quickly .  Good for minimalists * okay. if there is any review you listen to let it be this one. the product is ungodly hard to squeeze out of the package. it dries INSTANTLY and flakes everywhere. It is streaky and DRYING. the shades ranges are all tones of YELLOW. WHO WANTS THAT."

I am an extremely discerning consumer. And I have combination, oily skin, acne prone, so I am a great barometer for quality. This foundation has been my #1 for the past few years. If you're looking for something that blurs pores, is full coverage, mattifies beautifully, and you do look like a real life filter— this is your foundation! Absolutely amazing. 20 out of 10 stars. Have re-purchased a few times.

I was using Mac before and did not realize how much harsh chemicals that were in it that messes with your hormones and can give you issues down the road I have red pigmentation.takes it away * This is great if you want something light but looking to have a beautiful, smooth glow. Makes your skin look healthy and balanced.  If you are oily I suggest setting with a powder and use a matte setting spray.  When i want a makeup look i use their powder foundation to set.  Great for the summer or just a natural look. * Great product! * Loved it * I've been trying to find something like this forever! I have pretty good skin and got away from using foundation. I just use tarte shape tape under my eyes and around my nose/chin for redness. But I wanted a little something just to enhance my skin. Everything either has sunscreen in it which I do not want or looks like like I put highlighter all over my face. This does not have any shimmer or glitter like the CT Hollywood filter. This provides minimal coverage but gives your skin a glow. You can always spot conceal if you have a blemish and this goes nicely on top. I can also see using this under or on top of higher coverage foundation for a dewy look. If you have extremely oily skin I do not think it would work but for normal to dry its beautiful. The thing I can compare it to most is milk makeups skin tint, but that clings to dry patches and separates. This does not, its perfect! * I love this brand. * Love this product! So glowy! I wear this instead of foundation and it works perfectly!"
141,jane iredale,beyond matte liquid foundation,pimprod2008017,2552811," * This makeup did not sit well on my skin. It showed every pore and imperfection. Including any dry skin and did not cover well at all. I wanted to really like it but it didn't work for me * I love this foundation, its like your own skin but better. * At this price I'm pretty disappointed. Color match was great and does not oxidize, but that's where the pros ended for me. Definitely not full coverage, didn't blend well and shifts/splotchy. If you're an oilslick like me… this is a total waste. Maybe good for dryer skin? Going back to Dior at this price point and won't be purchasing this one again. * This foundation brought out texture and wrinkles I have never seen before. It is not very blend-able, as it takes a lot of manipulation to look somewhat acceptable. This product is very drying and I have oily skin. Not to mention it does not adhere to the skin, it slips and sides off your face throughout the day leaving you patchy. * I finally found my holy grail foundation, I didn't even buy it at Ulta but that's how much I loved it to write a review. It feels like I'm wearing nothing, it matches my skin perfectly which has been a nightmare for years trying to find a good match. * This coverage is a lot more sheer and dewy than I had anticipated. This would be a beautiful foundation for someone with dry, mature skin since it does not crease. The colors are not accurate either. I suggest ordering one to two shades darker. * I need to keep looking. I have a full bottle that I hope to find someone that it works for."

143,maybelline,instant age rewind eraser treatment foundation,pimprod2043641,2620458," * everybody hating on it really does not comprehend what the product is advertised as. it's a natural finish tinted spf sort of think, labeling it as a foundation is kind of misleading. but oh my gosh this product is so amazing and doesnt crease for me (i use maybelline powder to set),love itt * I used to use this foundation when i first started wearing makeup in middle school. I bought it again recently for my natural ""no makeup days"" for a quick sheer cover up for my acne marks. It is a nice foundation for people who want a light to medium coverage. Definitely not full coverage. Although its good, i think there are much better options out there. This foundation can be very greasy, so if you have oily skin, be sure to set it and touch it up throughout the day. It also applies very streaky. The applicator makes putting it on very quick and easy, but since it can be very streaky, blotchy, and greasy, youll have to spend extra time blending it and setting it. 

This product was great when i was younger but i wouldn't repurchase now. * I'm 50 and have used foundations at every price point from drugstore to luxury. This is my favorite (I'm buying my second bottle) because it doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything on my skin. It covers well without being heavy or cakey. I use it as my concealer as well. I would prefer pump packaging because with the twist-up you can't gauge how much you're dispensing, but I can get past that. Great, unsung foundation! * Great job on covering the blemishes. * I am picky about color shades and there is Many colors to choose from * It worked like a greasy highlighter on my face, highlighted flaws I didn't know i had. Although I like the sheer and shimmery tint I didn't find it useful enough to keep it. * I love how it goes on. Looks great on my skin."

It feels so nourishing and applies so evenly. It's light yet gives a good medium coverage. A great summertime weight. Not heavy but yet just enough color. Love it. Buy it. Give it a try. I think you'll like it. * This foundation is so perfect for me. It blends perfectly into my skin. It's so easy to apply. I just dab it on with a beauty sponge and I'm done in minutes! 
I love it ❤️ * I'm not sure why my skin reacts to foundation so terribly, but even the luxury brands make me look a little off. I know my undertone and have been able to pinpoint my exact color profile, so it's not that. Foundation usually sits on top of my face, amplifies my fine lines, and makes me look like a hot mess. Age Perfect Tinted Balm is the only foundation that makes me look better, and I wish I knew about it sooner. It's my favorite! * I have what the skincare industry refers to as ""mature ""skin. I am a make junkie and I had many foundations from drugstores and major department stores but as I got older they all made me look cake and settled into lines. I stumbled on this product and I love it. It's my skin only better. It lasts almost all day on my  combination oily dry skin. It is a wonderful product with light medium coverage for mature skin. Will definitely buy again * I've used 3 pots of this now and I'm still somehow surprised by how nice it is. The formula feels like it won't cover much, but it softens the appearance of/seems to fill and even out pores, scars, wrinkles, or any textures--I often get compliments on how smooth my skin looks when I use this. I've gone back and forth between two colors because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the color match is a little difficult. All in all, I keep trying new foundations just to come back to this one and be impressed by it. * I'm a light-medium skin tone that leans towards cool. I got started on this because an influencer raved about it a few yrs. ago. I decided to try it and couldn't had been more thrilled. I use shade fair 20 for reference. In the pot it looks more like a peach shade. It glides on effortlessly and melts into my skin. My dry/mature skin looks healthy. I'm sure I will get tired of this foundation, but for the last 3 yrs. I've been pleased. Only time will tell. * I was very skeptical to try this and was shocked. It is so good. 47 year old combo skin, apply with real techniques dense brush and its better than high end. How is this not more popular?"
145,hourglass,illusion hyaluronic skin tint,pimprod2020463,2575960," * I expected to love this based on reviews I'd seen, but for me, it applied very thick, sat noticeably in pores (an issue I've never had with any other product) and fine lines and didn't do anything it claims to do. I actually found it quite drying. I love HG products and am so glad Ulta is carrying them. I hope they'll carry the newer HG skin tint so I can try that one. * Im 55 and my skin is very dry, this product is moisturizing and never settles in my pores , an excellent alternative to foundation which just sat on my skin, this tinted moisturizer does not do that. I would highly recommend this product- * I have never had so many compliments about my skin since using this tinted moisturizer! It may not be for anyone needing full coverage makeup but someone looking for a glow and slight coverage! * It was very hard to find something for my aging skin that is full coverage, but doesn't settle into lines and look caked on. this was recommended in store and I absolutely love it! I apply with a beauty blender and use shape tape concealer with a tiny bit of setting powder. Really makes a difference being hyaluronic and any pictures while wearing come out great. A must in my drawer. * I wanted to like this. I have dry skin and some creepiness at 52. This made all of that worse.

It's very thick and kinda hard to blend out even with moisturizer and primer. 
I had to return this and buy the Too Faced brand hydrating liquid foundation. * Several comments said this was medium to full coverage which made me want to try it and it is not. There is absolutely no coverage at all. If anything it's just a glorified moisturizer so I'm thinking those other comments were for a different product. * Absolutely one of my favorite foundation. I love how it leaves my skin glowing and hydrated!"
146,jane iredale,refillable compact,pimprod2031651,2595249," * Tried to purchase this compact in the 21 Days of Beauty promotional, but couldn't add it to my cart, was it sold out?  Imagine my surprise the following day when it was available again at full price. Bait and switch advertising...not cool. * The discontinued gold compact was perfectly thin and light weight, making it easy to carry everyday. Also great for touch-ups when mineral foundation SPF is needed out in the sun! The closing latch wasn't super secure but I never had a problem with it opening in my purse. The new design is thick and super heavy. It's beautiful to sit on a counter, but useless weight for travel or carried in a shoulder bag. So sad I never odered backs up of the slim gold-tone compact! * I was surprised how expensive this compact is. But I have had so many contacts break and then I get crumbled pressed powder. This one looks like it will hold up well. I will let you know the first time I drop it-Yikes! * Very happy with this new compact. My JI mineral foundation stores securely,  the compact opens easily and now has a mirror. Yay! * I am a loyal Jane Iredale brand user. In fact, I have been using their products for over 20 years. The Jane Iredale line was recommended to me by the surgeon who did facial reconstruction after skin cancer surgery. 

Although I love their products, I have always been ""ehh"" about their packaging....until now! Thanks for finally giving up the gaudy gold (sorry, Jane Iredale) and going with this new, modern and aesthetically pleasing line of packaging. Since I have several of the old gold compacts, including the gold metals ones, I ordered one of the new compacts to see how I would like it. After receiving the new compact, I cannot wait to replace ALL my older versions! 

One more suggestion... in your future development, please consider making your eye shadows available in refills. I love the idea of being kinder to our planet and saving on the excess packaging. I do not mind paying separately for the cases if I know if is making a smaller, greener impact for future generations. =)

One final note of thanks to Ulta...I have been begging my local store to start carrying Jane Iredale. I am glad to see that you are at least finally carrying this amazing, clean line of makeup online! * I bought this on sale and I'm glad I did. It just makes it nice to put your foundation in. For the price of the foundation, it's a shame you have to purchase compact separately. * This packaging is overpriced and by default should be included with the powder. Waste of money."
147,nudestix,tinted cover foundation,pimprod2008837,2552723," * Overall I really like this product. I have sensitive skin and eczema, but this does not irritate my skin. The only thing I dislike is the initial smell when first applied - it has a strange medicinal smell. The smell goes away 15-20 minutes after application but it's strong when first applied. If this product was truly fragrance free I would give it 5 stars. * I have been upping my skin care regiment to combat hormonal acne and hyperpigmentation so my skin has been looking very nice. Thats where this product shines! It's very hydrating and lightweight so it looks like radiant skin! * I actually love this foundation bc i have blemish free skin and us it to even out hyperpigmentation. The issue is the pump… it does not pull product well after tube is no longer full and it doesn't come off. So its just wasted product. * Of course it doesn't fully cover blemishes, its not full coverage. I buy this again & again & pair it with concealer for under eyes / blemishes , & blush. Its so smooth, never breaks out my acne prone skin. I love it so much!! * Honestly I hate foundation, I have super sensitive skin and anything can break me out easily. This foundation is SO NICE!! It is more like a skin tint than a foundation, which I prefer if I do ever wear it, the smell is relaxing (if you're not an essential oil person I wouldn't recommend, the lavender is pretty strong), and it doesn't feel like anything is on. For my Florida girls this stuff is a great quick fix for the hot and humid days!! * I have super sensitive, rosacea-prone skin & my eyes are really easily irritated by makeup (ocular rosace) that started a few years ago - suddenly I couldn't wear my favorite makeup without breaking out, & my eyes burning, bright red. I searched & finally found a brand specifically for rosacea-prone skin! So happy to be able to wear makeup again! Over the last year or so the formula clearly changed - I couldn't find a color match & then my eyes started to  burn again. Back to the search - finally found this - I love this foundation & the whole product line! It's light & looks great - as others have said, I look like myself, only better! It doesn't settle in my lines or pores, doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It does feel a bit oily / has a bit of shine. Also, Nude 3 is a perfect color match for me when it goes on, but it does darken a bit across the day so I'm going to try 2.5 & save 3 for the summer. Otherwise, highly recommend!! * I bought this foundation and love it.  I'm 47 years old with dry and pigmented skin from aging and I like light coverage products due to aging skin look more natural than full coverage foundation.  Very moisturizing.  I still set with loose powder and yes would buy this as long as nudestix still made this."

It looks like SKIN and the shade is perfect for my pale olive toned skin. I love this so much!!! * I was so impressed with the color matching. This matched perfectly. Unfortunately, it was pretty watery. After a lot of shaking, it seemed to dispense properly, but the formula is pretty thick. It dries almost instantly and makes blending difficult. I also felt that it emphasized fine lines and wrinkles on my very dry skin. * overall the wear of the foundation wasn't bad, but my skin was red and inflamed when I took it off and I don't typically have sensitive skin and this was the only thing different in my routine * I like this brand and what little of this foundation I put on my face went on smooth and dried well. but it smelled so awful I couldn't use it! I didn't see reviews that mentioned the smell so I'm wondering if I got an old/bad batch…which would also be concerning. Disappointed but returning this * I have a hard time finding foundation due to an olive undertone, with silver being a better jewelry color for me. I purchased the Fair Lady T1N and this just.. it's awesome. It does dry down fast and blending becomes near impossible after, but with my combo skin, this is wonderful. I live in Maine and this foundation doesnt budge in the winter or the summer. One thing I will say is that if you have dry skin, this foundation won't be user-friendly. I typically have oil on my nose and forehead, with a dry chin. I lightly exfoliate my face, apply toner, then follow it up by a light non-cream moisturizer, and that solves the problem. * I was hoping this product would perform close to the Becca foundation that you can no longer get.
It's OK but not a go to foundation. It's more watery in my opinion and coverage has to be worked on quite a bit. 
I am sorry, but for me it's not what I was hoping for."

It is patchy and doesnt cover anything! * amazing foundation for when I'm in a rush. I have oily skin but am on retinol so a light layer of this foundation works better than my other foundations. it can cake up if you use to many layers and don't prep correctly. I did wish they had a better shade range. * I have gone through 4 or 5 of this foundation! So easy to apply and sets beautifully with a setting spray * This is my favorite powder foundation formula and has been for years - goes on so smoothly and is buildable. The last few compacts I've bought have cracked from barely any use. I had to dump the powder into a different container and use it that way. * so I do a full face every day. every once in a while I'll ""cheat"" and use this product to save time. it works sooo well. I use a light shade which I chose by pretty much matching my neck/highlight areas and use it mainly in my T zone. highlighting under eyes, forehead between brows chin and then I also add it along my jawline. then I go about my routine as normal but without the need for foundation highlight and baking. saves so much time! it builds well and has amazing coverage. it lasts all day. I have mature skin and hate when things settle into fine lines and wrinkles and I do not have that problem with this. it actually makes my skin appear younger compared to my full face routine with baking etc. I know I hav to find a new foundation to help avoid it but who has the time lol anyway... YES. this product is one I want to hoard in case it ever goes away. it's amazing. I use it with a compact dense brush. 

only downside is that I broke 2... but it's because I throw it in my purse and I know that's not ideal and on me for being careless. but if it's getting tossed around, be aware the powder may break. * This is a must have in my kit! I use it to lightly set my foundation and it transforms my face! I have also used it as a powder foundation for summer days and it is flawless! * This is the best powder foundation i have ever tried, i reach for this one over my high end one.

I like that it is paraben free, affordable, has beautiful natural looking medium coverage, is hydrating, and actually has shades that match my medium yellowy-olive skin tone.
It looks like my bare skin but more even. I can't speak to the longevity because I don't really pay attention to that, haha. 
Yes it does totally smell like what you would paint your wall with! I'm willing to put up with it for an affordable paraben free option that actually matches my skin. * I love this and would buy it again... only a shade lighter. * Got this foundation about 2 weeks ago… just don't even look into this product.

This product is AMAZING. Literally just set it in my skin with a damp beauty blender and feel like just this and mascara can take me through the day. Literally just use it on its own and it looks amazing. No primer, no setting spray etc. Definitely try! * In fairness, I have used only loose powders for over 15 years- so I am used to a more sheer look. I typically love Dior products and the reviews made me think it could work. Definitely not for me. I am in my early 40's and this set right into every wrinkle on my face and just looked flaky.

This is super light - ""your skin but better"" kind of product which is exactly what I go for when I do my makeup. It gives you a fresh look with a dewy finish but not overly shiny. I was able to find the perfect shade which is super exciting. Seems that most brands tend to offer a lot of cool and warm tones but not many neutral options. Shade # 313 was a great match! * Moisturize well but it's beautiful. Covers redness, sun spots. Pretty impressive for drugstore! * sigh * I fell in love with this tint. I have tried so many from Ulta, from the drugstores and I will tell you ... it's exactly what it reads.... it's a SERUM with Tint ! Not a tint with serum !! big difference. This product is more skin than makeup. Get it !! * At first I liked this tint, but the more I used it I noticed how streaky, oily, and cakey it looks. I have dry skin but it's so sticky no matter how much I set it with powder. Also, there's literally no coverage. Obviously it's a skin tint but there should at least be some coverage. It also burns a little as others have stated. * After trying many skin tints, I came back to this one. With maturing skin, it instantly evens skin tone and leaves a youthful glow. It works well with powders and creams. It doesn't settle into any fine lines and feels so light weight. I barely feel like I have anything on my face. This has turned into my favorite foundation especially just in time for summer! * Seems to give a healthier glow!"

I don't like the smell either. * This creamy foundation applies smoothly and evenly while blending with my choices of concealer (yay! doesn't seem to matter which brand). * This broke me out the worst I've ever seen it gave me huge painful cystic acne :( the coverage was pretty good but it has an odd smell. * I love that first and foremost its cruelty free, I think vegan too. It's affordable and so pigmented. I have oily skin but with the right orimer this does wonders. Try using the pink wet n wild primer. Coverage is amazing and LONG LASTING. ALL DAY (well at elast 10/12hrs) Please never discontinue it * This is the one for me. It has medium coverage on me , it doesnt look cakey.

I have stocked up on my shade 570 * I have other high end brand foundation...but this one right here is THAT GWORL!  I love the shade of this foundation...it's a perfect match to my skin.  And the absolute best thing is that it keeps my skin looking fresh and dewey the entire day. * I picked this up from ULTA (In store) beauty at 90% off and  just ordered 3 more.

It also looks a bit cakey but i highly recomend spraying do we setting spray onto your brush/sponge, and then blending out. * I normally wear Estee stay matte foundation but I was out and until it arrived I needed something in the meantime. I wore this out, was standing in the parking lot talking to my friends and some random lady walked up to us and said ""sorry to interupt but I just have to tell you, you are stunning"" ( she was talking to me) And then she walked off. I was never told that when I wore the Estee! What the heck, this stuff is GOLD. * I have been using this foundation for 5 years now. I will say it is not full coverage but it is buildable. This foundation feels so lightweight & it gives such a natural look. I've tried other foundations but always come back to this one cause its just so good! I tend to have an oily T-zone & everywhere else is pretty much dry but this foundation doesn't ever really cake or flake on me. I 100% recommend this foundation for an everyday natural look! * I love this foundation! it's affordable and stays on all throughout the work day * this foundation is surprisingly good for the price. it's buildable, smooth, and has a nice matte but natural finish. it flaked on my chin area after a few hours, but that could be my skin type. * Love this for my combo skin. I'm not extremely oily but I needed something that would actually last throughout the day without needing to powder by midday. I actually like it better than the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I am shade 090 in Lancome but have not been able to find a good color match as 090 is too light and the next shades are too dark and orange. I have very fair neutral skin. I prefer how the covergirl looks, it is very smooth with slightly better coverage, and L20 is a great shade and a closer match than the Lancome (maybe L20 is a dash too light but it looks perfect after bronzer). It gives a natural matte finish that doesn't cling or look cakey. Works well on my middle-age skin with fine lines. Has great medium-full coverage. Highly recommend! * I really love this foundation and I will continue to purchase it! Affordable and covers well."

159,essence,keep me covered long-lasting foundation,pimprod2037417,2603112," * i discovered this foundation a few years ago mainly because it was super cheap. turns out the price is pretty self explanitory because this foundation should be named ""keep her covered in some places but not others"" its super patchy. it could work in a pinch though. i mainly use it for photo shoots since its cheap and i can always buy more. the patchiness isn't very visible on camera which is why i do that. but as long as i'm alive that will never be on my face in public. * Good product & price. * I wish I was being dramatic because I really like the formula and how light it feels on my face, the one I got is my perfect natural shade when first applied. but when it dried down. tell me why I was literally orange?!? and I thought maybe oh I could've gotten the wrong shade. (second guessing myself) I went a sister shade lighter and It was a little less noticeable but it still made me yellowish orange so I mixed it with a different foundation to see what would happen and it fixed the issue for me but for those that wanna know by itself it shifts color when dry but it's still a light smooth waterproof formula.. 
might I add,  what might not work for me might work better for you, it's always best to mess around and find out * This is honestly a really good sheer foundation. Its not full coverage but percect for the summer needing something lightweight. Shade match was surprising good. I would definitely buy again * Not good. Coverage is pretty bad. Watery. Dont buy * Great product * Great for the price but doesn't stay all day but the shades are great they just need more for other skin tones."

161,e.l.f. cosmetics,camo powder foundation,pimprod2030787,2597461," * This is such a beautiful powder, it is very versatile. It has a buildable, medium to full coverage, leaning on the side of full. It feels extremely velvety. It is matte without being drying, which is also hard to do without talc. Hoping that they bring this back. You can use it as a powder foundation and a tinted setting powder. There is something spectacular about this formula. Really hope Elf brings this back. * After seeing many amazing reviews, I came here, excited to try this. But sooo much disappointed when there is no shade available for me, not even a close shade. * So overall if say its a good product if your a oily skin and combination skin then its pretty good buttt the shade range needs work it goes from a fair skin shade to a tan walnut color so id say maybe add more shadess ! BUT I DO LOVE HOW THEY INCLUDED DEEPER SKIN TONES * This works so well for my skin when I want to beaty ""filter"" my face. But this is noy for dry skin. * It broke the second I tapped my brush on it. Then it was impossible to blend out on my face and ruined my makeup ): * I love this powder this is the best powder that I have discovered as of lately. Elf kills it with all the products they release but this is top tier. * I really wanted to like this product, but even though I moisturize my skin, it leaves randow streaks on my face, as if i applied it with a paint brush. And leaves weird marks on my nose that I cant blend out and have to literally use my nails to scratch off. I have oily skin and never experienced this with a powder foundation."
162,ulta beauty collection,velvet matte longwear foundation,pimprod2020823,2560234," * I was pleasantly surprised with the price and coverage * I would recommend ""light warm"" to a mortician who is working on the deceased there's no ""light warm"" about this. It's pure white and awful. * Smelled horrible right out of the tube.  Bought just to mess around and imediately threw away.  Would not recomend to anyone, ever. * I bought this for a lighter highlight effect. It's to thick and cakes hard to blend. * This is ultimately is not bad for the price but the shade I got dud not match the screen I ordered it from so.... and honestly makes you have texture really badly. But it is great if you use it for concealer instead. * Bought on clearance just to mess around.  (Three shades so I could try contours.). Smells too terrible to even do that.  I have never theown away makeup I just bought before this.  I know it is on clearance but it should not be sold at all. * I loveeeeeeee this foundation! It gives me the full coversge that i need"
163,kiko milano,full coverage 2-in-1 foundation & concealer,pimprod2020414,2576034," * I love Kiko. I live in Italy and was introduced to this brand by one of my girlfriends.All of their stuff is amazing. This foundation is great but definitely runs a bit warmer than I expected. I'm usually light neutral or 35N and grabbed shade 30N, it was darker than expected and waaaay too yellow on me. * I love this foundation * I was hesitant at first ,because I just heard from this brand but I'm glad i gave it a try. And it was on sale 😁 felt good on my face. I used it and yes it was worth it the staying power  was good specially of your from az. * Have a hard time matching foundation to my skin tone and this matches me perfectly. It looks natural and has buildable coverage. For the price, you cannot beat it, I own foundations double the price and this is now my go to. Give it a shot. :D * I bought this like a month ago and I love it! You dont have to use a lot and literally your face is flawless. One of the things i love about this product is it doesnt dry out your skin. I got the shade neutral 25 and id say that its a mix of fair and tan. I also really love the application part of it, the wand is really nice!!! * Covers a lot without having to apply a ton. Love the application wand * I love this foundation I find myself reaching for it more  often than the others. it's not drying, not greasy,  the coverage looks like my skin but glowy, and not cakey. The kiko Milano powder is awesome too for baking BTW. This foundation is way very similar to TF Born this way foundation, (but not as greasy) kiko milano is underrated IMO. Yes I would recommend."
164,well people,bio stick foundation,pimprod2008575,2553269," * The old formula truly was the best, I looked forward to applying it every morning.  Blended like a dream, gorgeous satin finish, blurred imperfections, clean and fragrance free.  The color 1C was actually a cool tone, this new 1C is PEACH toned....very warm, and the formula change truly makes me sad....it's not the same. They ruined a perfect product. * I absolutely love this product! The smell is a bit strong and the application is a little off-putting, but it blends great and looks great! I found that instead of using a traditional primer like elf power grip, using a setting spray to prime made application easier and blending smoother. * My skin looked worse with this. Highlighying pores no matter how much or how many different methods i use. And shows every bump, dry patch, etc. its so weird. Like the opposite of why we wear makeup in the first place. So mad i was fooled that im writing a review * I have very fair and pink skin and have always had trouble finding foundations that match my tone, never mind work well on my oily/combination skin, but I will say that this one does a good job! I was nervous buying online without match testing, but I got the 1C and would say its a pretty good match for my skin tone. 

My pros for this are definitely: generaly matches my skin, works well with my oily/combination skin, it coming in a stick format is very convenient and mess free, stays on very well, looks natural, and doesnt make my skin feel gross

My cons would be: not the perfect match (wish the undertones were more p and that the shade was slightly lighter), can get a little cakey if i put too much on, and a little hard to blend. 

For context I've been wearing Too Faced Born this way foundation in the shade Snow for years now because it's the only foundation I've found that comes close to matching my skin, but I've always run into the same problem of not being able to apply the foundation too thick because then you can tell it's not a true match. Anyway, I would say overall thi one does a better job, has better ingredients, feels better on my skin, and is a good price point.

My last points would be dont let the 1 star reviews scare you, this foundation is very nice and as long as you use a wet sponge to apply and don't mind the mild scent of castor oil that fades in about 30 minutes :) * The old formula was amazing.  Shade 1C was a perfect cool tone as described.  This newer version is very peach in tone and no longer qualifies as cool toned.  So  if you are a fair, cool toned person...look elsewhere. * I have come back to this product again and again after trying other hydrating foundations that are too thin and messy or settle into pores. This is my favorite non-SPF foundation. It is like a natural version of cover girl compact makeup. It's vegetable oil based so it does smell like olive oil. But it's so nourishing and convenient with the solid stick. It smooths on well to a medium coverage and natural dewy finish that doesn't settle into my pores or cause breakouts for me. And with a light powder to set, it stays all day. I do wish they had lighter shades as the lightest warm (2W) is a bit dark for me in winter. But I'm a repeat customer of this good clean dry skin foundation option. * This brand is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I live in the desert and ingredients like hyaluronic acid just pull the water out of your skin because there's no water in the air here. It seemed like every make up and skincare brand hopped on that train and I couldn't find anything for my skin (dry) and climate type. I hope they never change the formula! I'm almost 30 and I'm starting to get crows ft etc and this really does a great job of camouflage without settling in any wrinkles."

 There's no Comparison... bring this back * I need this to come back!!! I haven't found anything that i really like. * I bought this product for many years and I always loved it. However since Kat sold the product off its formula has changed for the worse. I've tried the new version and it's awful I've tried fenti, tarte, double wear, and two others they all suck! * Mine always smelled like paint. Super thick, matte and cakey but superior coverage to anything made ever. * Please bring it back!!!! Nothing compares * My favorite and un replaceable foundation. I haven't found a similar to this one not one!!! This is the best foundation for OILY skin and tge coverage amazing. Loved that it last all day mind you i live in Az and the weather is HOT this foundation would not move at all. Pleas eplease being this back because Good Apple is not close at all in coverage and wear. * This was the only matte foundation i found that made my textred mature skin not look more textured and makes me look older like all other matte foundations I've tried! This one looks so amazing. Stayed all day and i sweat alot on my face. I really dont know why they got rid of this foundation. I literally have not one bad thing to say about this foundation. I really hope they bring this back!!!"
169,lorac,pro soft focus longwear foundation,pimprod2013331,2558415," * I don't like to leave bad reviews, but this foundation was a disappointment for me as I love, LOVE their glass primer. First is that it came out very watery. I understand it is buildable but this was really runny. As others have said, it has a faint maple syrup smell - but for me it was maple syrup mixed with chemical. I am also having some kind of skin reaction and irritation since using this. Nothing major, but enough for me to not use it anymore after 2 uses. Lastly it did not last more than 4 hours. It smeared, creased and caked in areas on my face. Luckily I bought this on sale and just gave it to my niece. This might work for others but for me - no. Sadly their foundation does not live up to the quality of their glass primer - which for me is the best primer in all my years. * I was amazed at how full coverage it is! & how it dosent even look like im wearing foundation! I mean wow !! Definetly will be purchasing more! * I never had a Lorac foundation before, but I know the brand revamped so I thought I would give this a try. It did not dissapoint!!! I have roseacea and dry skin, and this worked amazing for coverage. There is a small scent but it's sweet and lowkey reminds my of syrup. Besides that there are no complaints from me. I would highly recommend using the shade finder tool to compare it to your current foundation. I'm an olive skin tone so it's hard to find foundations that are inclusive of that. I got a summer shade and a winter shade because  I love this foundation so much. Highly recommend! * I don't know if this is supposed to be runny as only a few reviews mentioned it but it's basically colored water & it's so messy. I will never buy this again. * This is my new favorite foundation,
! It has excellent coverage with a natural finish. I have dry skin but find a lot of the hydrating foundations transfer and/or leave my skin looking oily by the end of the day, this foundation looks good all day and doesn't transfer. It does have a incredibly potent smell that lingers long after it dries, but I have been able to get used to it and I only notice when during application. * Although I like this foundation in everyway I have to give a low score because it isn't CRUELTY FREE.   There is no good reason for testing on animals and there are plenty of good products available which ARE CRUELTY FREE too. * I purchased this on a whim as i saw it on sale. I received it at the same time another package with the new Prada foundation came in, and I'm shocked that i like the Lorac foundation more than the Prada!  I applied this with my Hourglass foundation brush as the formula is quite thin amd it went on beautifully. Its so smooth and the finish really is a soft matte. It seems to be very long lasting as well. My first favorite foundation of the year."
170,kiko milano,active foundation,pimprod2036981,2607365," * Ok, there are a lot of decent stick foundations out now (not great, but decent).  I don't think this is one of them.  It's the old school sort--the kind that feels very waxy.  If you have dry skin, you will not be pleased.  It's very hard to get the finish to look good, and even harder to get it to stay looking good.  It's probably not going to save you time or make your life easier on the go. * I am blown away by how amazing this stick foundation is!! It gives a barely there feeling which i love. It does not settle into fine lines and stays on all day. Can't wait to try more stuff from the brand!!! * This stick goes on sooo smoothly! Absolutely love the consistency of this makeup! My skin looked like a barely there makeup look, exactly what i was going for. Definitely need to extend the shade range of this makeup but other than that this stuff is amazing!! * great coverage for my skin tone and felt smooth.  please add more skin tones so all people can have it. * this shade range has every type of tone for lighter skin but for 1 dark complexion do better * I honestly dont unserstand why people who've never tried this give it a low rating due to the shade range. This is an Italian owned brand. Majority of the population is olive, light to medium skintones. Many of them/us have a hard time finding our shades. Go try Fenty Beauty if you dont like it. Anyways, this is fantastic. Super blendable and looks smooth on my texture. * the shade range is disgusting. its not like italy is a sheltered country or anything, many POC reside there. darker women, men, and all in between deserve to have products that fit their skin too. do better."
171,maybelline,instant age rewind perfector 4-in-1 whipped matte makeup,pimprod2028923,2590459," * Its like it never dries and doesnt stick to your skin. So skin ends up looking splotchy. Wipes off easily and blends with nothing. Won't purchase again! * I have combination skin, super oily with dry patches. I hate the feeling of foundation so I just prefer something super light to even out my color and mattify me. This stuff is perfect! It feels completely weightless and looks natural. It wears off gradually by the end of the day without looking crazy. Definitely my favorite face makeup! * It wiped off easily didn't  stay on my face. I would use it in a certain spot and i would try and apply it somewhere else and it would wipe off * As for color match, it's perfect. But it doesn't really cover up my imperfections like age spots * Looks great on my skin. * Very light coverage. Feels so light and soft on skin. Not oily after a full day of wear! Doesn't cover blemishes the best but will give a nice even tone over the skin. Blends nicely! * I loved this! Its very light weight. I used under this my normal skin car rountine. And i wear elf glow sunscreen and halo glow with this bb cream and i loved the result. I do use conceler as well. And i dont feel caked on. Honestly try this method."
172,flower beauty,get real serum foundation,pimprod2022967,2577491," * Ordered Porcelain, second to lightest shade, but its still pretty orange and not as pictured. * Pretty good coverage for a serum foundation, very dewy, very smoothing over texture. Hides my pores, my skin drinks this up. It doesnt settle into fine lines over time like alot of foundations do on me, I have dry skin. I dont know how this would hold up on oily skin, but its great for dry skin! Almost seems soothing for my skin, as it makes my skin very soft when I take it off, has been good for my acne as well. Good on dry spots and excema around my eyes!  Will probably need to set with powder as it is very dewy, but it looks amazing with powder too. Mixes well with other products. Only con is the shade range, not grear for pale girlies * Light coverage, runny. * I had the worst luck with ordering this both  times the  foundation bottle was broken and leaking everywhere also they should've put it in a cardboard box instead of a mailer envelope ,it was an absolute mess that I had to ask for a refund. * I wanted to like this but its sooooo oily right from the start. When I put it on it was very sheer and its not really something I can build up. Also it literally wipes off so there is that. * So good 😊 such good coverage only thing that I didn't like about it was that it was thick. * I am someone who likes a no-makeup look, and this is perfect! The product is very hydrating and goes on in a nice thin coat to make you look flawless and like you don't have makeup on. Unsure if it's buildable since I didn't try. Highly recommend!"

It is so thick it won't pump out. The foundation is clumpy and doesn't spread at all. Why did they change a good product???? * This foundation is worth trying! Creamy, spreads nicely (I use a brush), nice colour matching (I consider myself a medium brown skin colour). Overall great product! * I cannot say enough GOOD THINGS about this CC cream. There comes the point when foundation is out, and CC cream is in, and I am pleased with this product's color choices, smooth texture, and luminescence. I mix two shades and apply the first color as a primer. This CC cream doubles as my concealer; it's that easy to apply. * This product: separates BADLY and doe not blend well at all; Smells weird and chemical-y; offers VERY little coverage, even for a CC cream, and is overpriced because of all these factors. Positives: it makes skin glowy and has SPF. I wouldn't buy this personally - Pacifica's skincare and fragrance are AMAZING, but makeup seems to be a weak point. * This product came out separated. Tried shaking product to get product mixed together and it came out somewhat like foundation. Does not go on skin nicely. Do not recommend. * it comes out as a clear oil with little specs of color that don't blend."

This breathable, light satin finish can be set up on itself until youve found your inner teenage beauty queen! It's perfect for my skin type & it smells lovely too. A+ Ulta! * I love this lightweight easy to apply buildable foundation.

Please please PLEASE bring back some of the lighter colors. * I bought this over the holidays and LOVED it!! Goes on easily and is weightless. Soooo disappointed to see that my shade is not available. Please do not discontinue this product. * My perfect shade is Light to Medium Cool.  Not available the last 2 times I've tried to buy.

I was not expecting to fall in love with this product, but it's truly flawless. I have NEVER had a shade match me so accurately. This product is buildable and can be worn for 100% full coverage or as a tint. The color is pigmented enough to cover dark undereye without concealer for a very natural ""no makeup"" finish. The price is a steal lol * I have never had a more perfect color match in my entire life. I show this to the older women in my family and you would think I was literally doing a magic trick lol shock awe and wonder. I often and loudly recommend this in True Caramel. Perfect for lace on wigs or just on skin * The foundation is very smooth and moisturizing.  It provides medium coverage, so I build it by applying several applications to get a more full coverage.  It is a great product for the price. * I have purchased this product before and I liked it. This time the product was used. It had a finger smudge print on it when l opened it and the sponge applicator had make all on one side. I ended up purchasing something else at another store. * First, note this has the ingredients that Danessa Myricks uses for her foundation at an affordable cost. This provides a great shade match, makes skin look healthy and even, easy to take with you and stays on even if you sweat. The magnesium carbonate in the formula absolutely is wonderful for sweaty moments. I just find you can't really apply it with anything other than a sponge. Brushes with dense round tops don't pick it up well, as nothing else does. If you don't want to buy a beauty sponge you'll be fine to use the one it comes with. * Great shade for Hispanic women."
176,essence,keep me covered powder,pimprod2043728,2618266," * This is a solid foundation. The key is to prep your skin first. But prep I mean make sure your skin is well-moisturized and use a primer. * This is powder foundation, NOT setting powder. Make sure you moisturize and hydrate!!! well before applying. Test with primer to see which works well with it. 
I found this super easy to use and just faster than liquid foundation. I like it with Wet n Wild Glass Correct in green underneath over redness first. I also used a makeup setting spray after. 
I'm bummed it has poor reviews from people misusing it and that there's no light cool shades left. I just came back to buy another 2:( 
If you see it in store grab it for FOUNDATION,  it's good! * i absolutely love essence, but this is just not it. i wore this to school one time, and my face looked so white and flaky, and very cakey. you can tell the product is cheap, and that's not good. * I love this powder! On top of liquid foundation of course. It gives your foundation that extra boost and smooths out your skin even more. I have Extremely oily skin, I'm talking about im already getting oily an hour after I put my makeup on and this powder does not separate. I even use it to touch up my makeup and makes my skin look smooth and fresh and doesn't cake. best powder I ever used, works just as good as the Mac studio fix plus powder in my opinion. Get it! * The power broke during shipping. And it makes gou look evey ghostly. It ashes out anytning you have on your face * I have used this several times and it's important to remember this is a powder foundation, not a setting powder. it's fantastic when used over moisturizer and primer. also great for touch ups. it definitely looks cakey when not used as described. * This will seperate your makeup, does not look good on almost any skintone, ashy, cakey, and its extremely hard to open."

Isnt all foundation tinted""? Maybe try tinted moisturizer * Light and hydrating product that evens out dull skin without looking heavy! Great for looking put together on minimal makeup days. * The coverage of this bad boy is wat too light to be called a foundation, but it doesnt have any skin care benefits which is I guess why they can't call it BB cream. It's refreshing to have a product with light coverage and a natural finish instead of dewy. Great for no makeup makeup days. * I found the Tawny shade of L.A. Girl Tinted Foundation in my local Ulta's clearance section and figured I'd give it a try. When I got home, I used Ulta's shade matcher and it told me I was really Warm Sand in this product (based off entering Ginger for bareMineral's COMPLEXION RESCUE Tinted Moisturizer Mineral SPF 30). Warm Sand perfectly matches my skin right now during the winter. I'll try Tawny again in the spring/summer, but it was a close match too. I love how lightweight this product feels and how easy it is to apply — I dot it on right from the tube and the dab/blend with a lightly moist makeup sponge. It looks just slightly dewy but doesn't feel overly wet or sticky. It also works well under my bareMinerals BAREPRO 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation if I want to look more made up, but between the price and its natural look when used solo, it fits well with my minimalist approach to makeup. * I am 66 years old.

Thankfully the darkest shade works for me so I enjoy the product but it's hard to get behind a brand that doesn't give darker skintones a thought. * I was really hoping this product would work for me but it didn't. I found the baked foundation to be much more drying than other pressed powders I've previously used. Felt like it didn't go on well and had horrible coverage. Will not be buying again. * Takes forever to build up. Not for anyone who wants medium to full coverage. Light to medium at best. * Honestly if you're looking for a foundation to take a chance on.. this is definitely it. I'm not sure why I even chose to buy this but I love it!! I use it over concealer and it evens out my skin tone perfectly. Also does not make me look too orangey or cakey. * Just meh"

I love the shade range for brown tones. * I use this all the time! I do recommend this. * this product is horrible. it doesn't blend at all and it's extremely patchy and cakes on easily. there are cheaper foundations that are better than this!

183,mented cosmetics,skin by mented foundation,pimprod2022002,2578536," * I saw mented today and bought m10, d10, t30(like 2 of each) I did this with complexion changes and such in mind. It was so easy to apply, felt nice on my skin, looks natural and I think m10 is my shade - it is spot on (for my beautiful summer complexion ) I'm excited to have found Mented! not a con for me, because i don't choose a makeup to smell good, but definitely seems like fragrance wasn't added.

I have pretty dry sky so I know to add a moisturizer before applying this. I am not saying this drying…but makeup ondry skin can appear patchy * This product feels and looks like you have no product on. * I have searched for the perfect match years! So excited to have finally found a shade so spot on with my skin tone that it's almost scary. The stick foundation is easy to apply, blends well and leaves me a great natural glow. * Looked awful on me. Horrible on oily skin and def dont get if you have light skin. This foundation isnt made for light skin tones which sucks. * Perfect match almost feels like a tinted moisturizer. I'm oily so I still need a powder but for stick makeup it goes on smooth and doesn't run off. I'm sold * Okay so hear me out.. the color match to my skin is amazing!!! it blended beautifully. However, I have combo oily skin and nothing could have prepared me for how shiny and oily this foundation is. This is not a matte foundation so beware!! * Hidden Gem hands down. I have been looking for a good foundation in general for a few years now, I went high end low end drugstore I went tinted moisturizer to full coverage and non did what I actually wanted. I love make up but finding a good foundation for my oily skin that wont force me to re touch (which I'm horrible at by the way, always makes it worse) was close to impossible without making me feel like I have pounds of make up on especially for work. I had tried the Hourglass foundation stick which was highly rated and felt very chalky on my skin. I did a search of stick foundations and came across this one. I am the lightest shade in this line and am on my way to re up for a 3rd time! I have never purchased 1 item more than once since they end up not working out for a while. The coverage is amazing from one layer to a 2 layers if I want a fuller look. It glides on like butter on my skin  and gives me a glow without an oily look if that makes sense. I rarely have to completely set my face because it sets so nice on its own and will literally last me over 9 hours without any cracks or separation and looks like I just applied it minutes ago. It makes my face feel hydrated and not like I'm wearing loads of make up. This is a long review and I never leave a review but I am truly in love with this foundation! I am so thankful for this brand because I am the in between when it comes to make up, I'm a semy fare complexion with neutral undertones. Many lines have a Yellow undertone or an olive undertone which makes me look washed out. This is truly a bang for your buck and will leave your make up looking flawless."

185,mac,studio radiance face and body radiant sheer foundation,pimprod2023387,2579193," * wow. I can go on about this foundation forever. I have very pale, dry skin, this shade range cancels out any issues ive had with light foundations that are too orange, does not stick to or emphasize when i have dryness. I 100% recommend this product. * This doesn't settle in wrinkles like a lot of foundation.  It is a bit hard to use to start with but once you figure it out it's very nice.  Good for older and younger skin.  I'm 64 and it's the best I've ever used. * This foundation is perfect for evening out skin tone without making it look like you painted your make up on. I really love pairing it with cream contour and cream blush, and then just setting it with a setting spray- it gives a gorgeous dewy finish. You can set it with powder to make it a little more long lasting too. I always try to catch it on sale. I think having a gorgeous light coverage foundation like this is perfect for an interview, meeting someone new, or embracing your natural beauty! Its made me feel so much more confident in my own skin. * The origin to my villain story. I listened to an ULTA employee, first foundation for my high school homecoming. Three days later I broke out, having clear skin all my life. Ever since, it never stopped. I had to go on meds to cure my acne. Don't use. * I used to use the old face and body without the radiance and always loved it so im not surprised I love the new version especially because I like more of a sheen/glow to my skin. This is a very sheer coverage foundation but is buildable if you want a little more coverage. Also I can apply this over my skincare without it pilling! * I never tried the original face and body. Honestly, I was never interested in this foundation until I started watching Miss Megan Robinson on tik tok. Seriously you NEED to follow her!! I generally have oily skin. It's been a lot more calm, and a lot less oily after I got rid of all the actives, and JUST started washing, toning, and using AN OIL (I know right, but it's true, oil loves oil, using an oil will keep your skin from producing a lot of oil) I can now wear this foundation confidently, and it is BEAUTIFUL!! It's friction activated so I suggest applying with fingers and rubbing it in so you can start to feel the ""gripping and thickening"" action that happens with this foundation(which is the best most fun part for me). The coverage is obviously light but it looks like perfected skin. Only the best things are peeking through. Everything blends nicely on top, and I mean EVERYTHING, from all different brands. It wears great too and looks even better as the day goes on. Its softly radiant and skin like if you powder (which I still do) and if you don't you'll look like a freshly hot glazed donut (some people like that, some people don't) I get the hype of this foundation and dare I say it's made it into my top 5 line up!!?? Coming from an oily girl that is shocking. If you're wondering, I use the Danessa Myricks yummy skin balm in translucent as a primer, this foundation, all my other creams and liquids, and I set with Mac studio fix powder and one size setting spray. PERFECTED NATURAL RADIANT SKIN * Wear it everyday and have received unprovoked complements."
186,vdl,perfect lasting foundation,pimprod2006000,2560248," * I LOVE this foundation! It's definitely full coverage. It look so beautiful like natural skin! It doesn't dry matte, so definitely set it with powder. I'd say a little goes a long way! It last all day & still look beautiful even after a workout. The only areas that would slightly crease would be around my smile lines & chin but nothing crazy. I wish the foundation would be more available but it's so hard to find & the shade range isn't the best but overall 10/10 I would recommend! My closest shade is A05.5. I also tried mixing V05 & V04 to get my shade if anyone is wondering. I hope this helps.  :) * Coming from an Ulta Employee, after trying every foundation under the sun, this foundation makes my skin look FLAWLESS, airbrushed, smooth. I do have to set with a translucent loose powder because it is still a little tacky in my opinion. Shades are FANTASTIC. A02 matches me the closest; however if there was a slightly paler shade with a yellow undertone that would be my perfect match. I ordered A01 and A02 on YesStyle and to me 1 was almost darker than 2, but it may just be the undertones. ULTA PLEASE BRING THIS BACK. It took me over a week with express shipping on YS btw I paid $19 extra FYI In case anyone was going to order it, I think it ships from China. Idk what is in this foundation but  I want to buy every bottle just incase it ever gets discontinued😅😭😭😭 * My relationship with foundation is a nightmare,I'm a brown skin girl with golden undertones in the summer and pale skin in the winter,without much prep this foundation matched me perfectly and stayed on ALL NIGHT,the a night of dancing 💕LOVE THIS STUFF * Please restock ASAP! This is my favorite foundation!! I literally bought 3 bottles because I have a feeling Ulta might discontinue this foundation...
 FYI- you can still find VDL on Yesstyle BUT it's NOT the same foundation. The one on Yesstyle has SPF & it has more of a dewy finish 😩 * I hope Ulta is not going to stop selling this foundation. It is an amazing satin finish foundation. Looks flawless on the skin and makes blemished skin look smooth. Wears beautifully throughout the day and is full coverage. Highly recommend. FYI if they stop selling it at Ulta you can find it on YesStyle. * I bought this foundation in the color A06. I tend to have a hard time finding foundations because I am in the weird shade range where I'm typically between medium/tan and dark/deep in various brands. I have Neutral slightly golden/olive undertones and find that many brands get close but not perfectly my shade. Most times foundations are too golden (almost orange looking), too cool, exactly neutral when I need just a touch of yellow in the foundation, or they just skip my shade altogether. I was pleasantly surprised when this foundation was an exact match. I love the natural finish to this foundation. I have dehydrated combo skin that if not properly hydrated will get oily in the t-zone (mostly nose area) and will remain normal or slightly dry everywhere else. When I wear this for several hours my foundation goes from very natural to radiant but not oily as my t-zone starts to break into a bit of a shine. I really don't have anything bad to say about this foundation except because of the limited shade range there's a chance you may not find a good match depending on your skin tone and undertone. Hopefully Ulta continues to keep this foundation available. * I would describe this foundation on my skin as full coverage with a satin/slight dewy finish. I have acne prone skin with acne scars and this foundation covers everything without causing any texture. Long wearing and mask proof. Doesn't cause breakouts. Would recommend for various skin types."
187,l'orÃ©al,age perfect creamy powder foundation,pimprod2021675,2569747," * Very light, silky powder texture. The ""creamy"" title is very deceiving though. It's powder. And quite drying immediately on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this for aging skin whatsoever. Great product for on the go touch ups on oily skin. * I don't care for the sponge applicator because it really doesn't go on right, but I found that using a brush to apply is so much better and it goes on more evenly.  You can add more where needed without it looking blotchy.  I love it! Used the color Sienna * Goes smooth and cover some imperfections, but looks natural. Leaves your skin soft and beautiful. * Lightest shade, Ivory.  You MUST prep the skin with moisturizer, sunscreen and either CT Hollywood Flawless Filter or the Maybeline knockoff or a dewy primer or sunscreen.  Buff in with a brush after applying concealer where needed.  Use powder bronzer, blush and highlight and a setting spray.  It looked amazing on my 48 year old dry skin and lasted all day.  Not powdery, didn't settle in lines, let's your skin peek through (is light coverage).   I really love it. * I thought since it's called age perfect it would be a moisturizing creamy powder. Nope. It's super drying and I have combination oily skin not even dry. Feels horrible right on application You can feel the makeup. Didn't blur anything. I had to take it off within 10 mins of application. Don't buy this stuff. * I wanted to try a cream to powder foundation to try to cover some dark spots. 
This covered what I wanted. It does look a little dry after application but I'm oily so it looks more natural after a few hours. * I love the age rewind concealer and seen this after looking for a good powder foundation. it is a really creamy, finely milled powder. I don't think it's really pigmented but you get enough coverage to even everything out and in my opinion it really does blur. I use a flat top Kabuki brush to buff it in, slowly building up layers. I take product and tap it in where I need more coverage with a concealer brush. I find I get the most coverage this way. it's like your skin but better. gives you a nice natural finish and doesn't look cakey if you slowly buff and build. will be trying this as a setting powder for liquid since it blurs. it also doesn't make me breakout!"
188,hynt beauty,encore pressed powder foundation,pimprod2014352,2564466," * I was so excited to try this powder because of all of the positive reviews. Unfortunately, This product didn't work for my dry skin. And for the price I doesn't have great coverage. I don't see this product any different from any other pressed powder. Also, this powder has sparkles in it I guess to conceal how drying and powdery it makes the skin.. * I love this powder, my skin is dry but this powder always feels comfortable on, never adds any texture as other powders have for me in the past, def one of my fav powders * I LOVE this pressed powder! It takes away the look of shine and makes my skin look refined and even toned. I bought Ivory and it is the ideal shade for my skin tone, medium fair with pink undertones. It works well worn over concealer and foundation, or on its own. And, better still, it looks invisible and feels like nothing on skin! The mirrored compact is the perfect size for taking on the go and it even comes with an applicator sponge on a clear, hinged divider inside. Hynt thought of everything with this pressed powder! I will definitely buy again:) * I've always been reluctant to wear powder - most of the time I end up looking cake-y. This finishing powder is a game changer - so easy to apply and bonus, the packaging is so adorable! But more importantly my skin looks so velvety and super plump, definitely will be coming back for more when I'm through with this! * Love using this powder in-between zoom meetings to touch up my skin. Just gives me a more even/finished and natural look * One of my favorite products from Hynt * I used this foundation with the foam puff it came packaged with. Do not use with a brush, the powder is finely milled and will fall off your brush! I wore it over serum and moisturizer. My face got a little shiny throughout the day but that is common for me, as I have combination skin. I like that the coverage is buildable, I was able to apply two layers and achieved the coverage I was looking for. Best of all, the ingredients are natural and truly clean! No SLS, no parabens, no Lauryl Lysine, no Bismuth oxychloride! So happy Ulta is carrying this brand!"
189,hourglass,vanish seamless finish liquid foundation,pimprod2020422,2575785," * For a pro makeup artist, ( yes, you need to be a pro to know how to work with it) this is so far one of the best foundations that I have ever worked with. I recommend performing a gentle face exfolation before bed time and removing any peach fuzz for any makeup aplication, not just this foundation. It makes a huge difference in aplication and appearance of the final look/finish.
It works best with the Vanish smoothing primer. (To smooth down the pores that every human being has) It is runny but extreamly pigmented. Do not use too much or it will look cakey.Best apply with a dense buffer brush (Morphe 444 is my favorite) and then press it in with a beauty blender. I use the professional Kryolan setting spray first, and then set it with a good powder.( Jeffree Star, Fenty or Kryolan powder) It holds for 14h even in humid Florida. Best foundation for events. It's best for normal/ combination skin. I wish they had more shades.
Unfortunately it just has been discontinued, tho the company has gave me insites that they are working on perfecting the formula and making a new foundation for combination/oily skin (they currently carry luminous foundations for normal/dry skin) * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * This product is so thin & runny! Like water consistency. I pumped one pump on my hand & it literally dripped off me. I shook the bottle so many times & it still remained runny. I gave it a try on my face because I wanted to give the foundation a chance but the product just settled right into any crevice it could. I could literally see wrinkles/lines I didn't even know I had. * I got this during a sale and was so excited to try my first Hourglass product. I followed the instructions and reviews and only used a very little amount. It brings out my pores horribly, dries down very weird and makes my skin dry, and even though it feels light on my skin my skin feels a tiny bit sticky, not something I usually experience with prestige brand foundations. This is a miss for me. * This foundation is very reminiscent of Marc Jacob's 'Remarcable' . Full coverage and matte with a pore filling matte primer underneath . The bad reviews are really just people who don't know how to apply makeup . * Words do not explain how buttery this foundation is I have dry to normal skin and it blends it two to three glides. Will never use another foundation"
190,smashbox,studio skin 24 hour full coverage waterproof foundation,pimprod2009758,2552423," * Luckily I night this on a good sale a ways back but it is just not it. I have combo oily skin and so far regardless of the primer or moisturizer this just doesn't look good and will break down. I've been using juvias place which I like ten times better and I don't have to try to make it work. This foundation also oxidizes orange..so not just a shade but it'll turn more orange as well. I'm gonna try to find something to mjx it with but I won't be purchasing again and wouldn't recommend it. * I have oily combo skin, and this foundation did not stand the test of time. It felt very heavy, and transferred with the slightest touch (with setting powder). Only a few hours in, and it was breaking apart on my face, highlighting even the slightest texture. My pores were literally drinking this product up. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a foundation, and could not wait to take it off. * I have combo skin, I use the Bobby brown moisturizer primer underneath and only use a tiny bit with a brush. Looks flawless!! Do not use to much product otherwise it will look cakey, if you need extra coverage apply only to specific area with smaller brush. * 32f (no active breakout/indented scars only on cheeks/combination skin)This foundation has the worst formula I have ever used on my skin. I tried two different primers underneath and tried it on it's own and it just refused to settle or smooth out. It creases badly and makes skin look dry and caked with very minimal use of the product that looked worse and worse if you tried to use even a tiny bit more. Powders and setting spray do nothing to help. I tried beauty blenders and brushes and neither made it better. I ended up going back to a trusty Revlon foundation that was way cheaper and a much better formula. Do not waste your money if you do not have perfect smooth skin. * I have sensitive skin with large amounts of rosacea and occasional eczema. This product covers my redness very well, and can many my dry areas seemingly disappear. Smashbox was also a line that came up multiple times during my search for products best for sensitive skin. * Maybe this just doesn't work with some skin types. I've given this several goes with different amounts of product and application techniques and it always manages to cake up and accentuate every pore after it's settled. I decided to give this one more go, applying after a glowy moisturizer that managed to save some of my other cakey products and it still had the same issues after setting for about 20 minutes. * It has perfect coverage,  a very little goes a long way.  Love the Matt finish I got.  Like  all foundations,  you have to prepare your skin before you applying anything to it.  Use a brush to apply.  I patted it on."
