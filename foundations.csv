1,urban decay,face bond self-setting waterproof foundation,pimprod2044818,2623593," * This foundation checks all my boxes! It has a great shade match (im very fair/cool). It wears really well through the day. Easy to work with. Im oily and red around my nose and its the best my makeup has looked after wearing for a day! Didnt make it through my workout, but I have never met a foundation that could handle my oils and sweat! It lasted better than all the others I have tried. * I was extremely hesitant to try this because I have normal to dry skin and don't like anything too matte. I picked it up when it was 50% off because the waterproof self setting claims were hard to pass up. This is seriously the most skin-like foundation I own. It blends like a dream with a brush. It's blurring. It's super light weight. It does self set but doesn't look dry or cling to dry spots. It lasts all day (i usually wear makeup for 14+ hours). Powders, creams, and liquids all go on very nicely over it. I do set lightly with powder and setting spray because that is my preference but I could get away without it. With setting, it wears like iron under a mask as well. I haven't been able to get more than medium coverage but that's what I typically prefer anyway. * I have fibally foubd a replacement for the discountinued Born this Way Matte in the glass jar.  Ive tried many and thisbisbthe closest I've come.  Lasted all day and didnt crack or crease.  It does transfer if you don't set it.  So I would suggest settinf it despite whar they say.  Butbi am happy i found thia! * This is my favorite, stay all day, light as air foundation. * I love this foundation.  It has been my go to for years, but i have  recently quit buying it due to the lid.  It was constantly popping odd and getting all over my make uo bag and making a huge mess.   I hope they change the packaging for it asap * This foundation is mid I bought on sale during the 21 days of beauty and used it with and without powder. With powder definitely got cakey and started to crack in certain areas, but this product is pushed as ""self setting"". When used without powder get the same effect as a dewy foundation in my opinion I just looked sweaty instead of dewy. You can get the same effect with the maybelline dewy foundation for alot cheaper * love it"

3,dior,dior forever fluid skin glow foundation,pimprod2036824,2605019," * I love the foundation looks flawy but after 5 hours i get patchy spots in my face. My face is not oily is more dry i use a hydrating moisturizer but not working for me * Extremely hydrating and moisturizing. Exactly what I was looking for!! ❤️ * I'm Asian fair/light neutral skin and olive overtone, and for reference my PERFECT shade is Estée Lauder's 1W2 Sand; even though the Dior glow foundation doesn't have my color (1.5N was too pink and 1.5W was juuuuust a bit too yellow), I fell in love with the formula the first time i tried it - it was instant natural but impressive coverage, with just pea size product on my brush! And this formula is extremely glowy, so a litte definitely goes a Loooong way. 
I have also been mixing this foundation with lighter BB cream to create my own shade, its been great - the glow stayed on ALL DAY. In comparison, Estée Lauder is just a bit smoother and matte. 
Hope this helps! * I like this foundation, I would love it if my skin werent so problematic. If you have no acne or discoloration im sure this will be great for you! It has a nice glowy look without looking oily. It did not separate or settle into pores! Definitely worth a try * I really like this foundation. I feel like it has such a pretty glowy finish. I like the dewy finish even though I have oily skin so I do start to look oily much faster but still very pretty. I would love this product much more if it didnt transfer! The transfer is so bad and I switched to a different foundation because if it. * I really like this foundation. I feel like it has such a pretty glowy finish.

I was jaded when I tried it on, but was plesantly surprised !  The finish is demi-satin on my combination skin, good coverage without being mask-like."

5,lancÃ´me,teint idole ultra wear 24h full coverage foundation,pimprod2039028,2608119," * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] My new favorite foundation! It is light weight and the color match is perfect. I love that it covers my dark spots without feeling too heavy on my skin. It doesn't settle in my fine lines either. I really love that ot has sunscreen in it to kill two birds with one stone. One and done products are a go for me. * It makes me look flawless * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] It is not a full coverage so it didn't cover up my dark circles well. The shade is perfect because it wasn't a thick foundation. I don't recommend it for winter when we are more
Pale. Summer time this would work better * this is probably worse than my cheapest foundations. it's dry, patchy, and separates so fast no matter how I apply it. I've tried everything. I exfoliate, use all my normal high end face products before applying and it still looks like crap a few hours later. I had high hopes for it because the concealer was not bad at all. never again. * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] I didn't like this product! It gets my skin really dry, the coloring is too heavy for me. I tried adding enough moisturizer but the result was the same! * I was given this foundation as a gift from my sister in law, and I absolutely love it. I have oily skin and I'm also acne prone. usually if I  wear makeup too many days in a row I'll break out. This foundation hasn't made my face look oily later in the day and hasn't broken me out! It is pricey, but I'd be willing to get another bottle knowing it works better with my skin. * This foundation may be ok, but i was a user of the old version, so it just doesn't fit my expectations. Ever since the formula/color name change i have been unable to find my true color match. I also find this version to be thinner."

8,nars,light reflecting advanced skincare foundation,pimprod2030141,2591117," * This is my favorite foundation by far. Applys easy. A little goes a long way. It blends well with my skin and doesnt break me out. * Is super easy to apply, great coverage (a little goes a long way)! * Can hardly tell I have it on. Went on very smoothly and I love it. I will be getting more of the products. * Product was too watery * Okay, I love Nars.  Have combination skin. Was able to find the perfect shade.  The finish dried a little to flat and matte.  It would be ideal to wear if you need the make up to last.  This would be a great  back up makeup not an every day.  If you have oily skin...maybe your everyday. * This foundation is 100% worth the price. Its buildable coverage so you can decide how you want it to look. It covers acne but is somehow so thin and light. I use Mont Blanc becuase I'm so pale but it matches perfectly and doesn't oxydize. I recommend this to everyone buy it now!! * Highlights: looks natural on skin and blends well with other products. Has a slight dewy finish and feels lightweight and works well with my dry skin.

Not my faves: It doesn't cover my rosacea super well on its own but it is buildable. also it has a slight yellow hue to it on my skin."
9,mac,studio fix fluid spf15 24hr matte foundation + oil control,pimprod2044825,2622206," * my go to foundation. very buildable. always have it on hand * Please please bring back the old formula! I used it for 15 years! It was the best always made my skin look flawless. This new formula doesnt even come close! Not the same coverage and sits on top of the skin. Should have just made a whole new foundation instead of reformulating a perfect foundation! So sad about this. * It was cakey it barley did anything just made me brake out you extremely light coverage * I've had this for a couple months I've tried everything to make it work for me. I have normal to dry skin. nothing made this look luminous or flexible. dry and flakes as can be amd I've never had this with Mac. * I have been using this for a long time . I have tried others brands but I always go back to this one. * My absolute favorite. I mix it with my moisturizer to thin it out and it always looks beautiful. * I wore Mac Studio fix for years and only switched to try a different brand for a little while. When I realized there was nothing better than Mac Studio fix, I went back and purchased a bottle only to find out that they had completely changed the formula and it was absolutely terrible! It's been ruined! The original made my skin flawless and it lasted beautifully all day and night. This new formula does not last, it separates and creases, it sinks into all my fine lines and pores making my skin look disgusting and it made my skin break out. Very disappointing."

This works amazinf and i look airbrushed . But if you are on the dryer side then this wouldnt work very well * I absolutely love this foundation. It is amazing. * I am not into makeup because I hardly ever wear make up, but I have an event and when I do use the make up this product is great. I don't put too much effort in it. It just goes on good. It looks great. I just love it. * I received so many compliments about my makeup. I am truly thankful to the young lady who helped me find my correct match. * This product is a must have in my makeup kit. It is very buildable coverage. I use for special events, or when I know I'm going to be photographed because it photographs so well. It is considered matte but is not drying at all. I have combination skin and use water based products, and this jives so well with my other products. I can't recommend this enough - a little goes a long way so it's definitely worth the price! * Love * Wrong shade bring back"

14,it cosmetics,cc+ nude glow lightweight foundation + glow serum with spf 40,pimprod2031824,2594106," * None of the other CC creams from this brand carry fragrance so I don't understand why they added Fragrance to this one! Why why why???! There is no need for a foundation to have fragrance! Please Remove it! I do love that it's lightweight and and moisturizing. * It matched my skin perfectly and gave me a beautiful glow but it did not last. It turned so ugly on my skin that it literallt looked like i slept in my makeup. Would not recommend at all. * I enjoyed the overall look of the product. However, it significantly irritated my skin (the SPF, I think was the culprit). It also caused my mascara to smear throughout the day. In general, the feel was like I had oily sunscreen on my face. * Unfortunately I cannot wear this. I prefer a Cc cream for summer but this is a but too oily and transfers easily. The other does the same. And I have never been able to find a color match. I am a light neutral yet the only neutral they have is a medium. So many lights and fair. And the pink undertones still oxidize. * A skincare foundation would not be full of fragrance, silicones and comedogenic ingredients. I dont know what 'dermatologists' approved this formula. * I had been using the CC cream/illuminating- and I love it— But then I saw the Nude Glow and decided to try it.  Wowww!!  Complete coverage!  Weightless!!  I tried applying it with my fingers, and that coverage was the same. It still was weightless, and then I applied it with a brush and then I tried a sponge. All three types of applications —still, the product covered extremely well and the coverage was weightless and comfortable, and lasted all day and worked really well with my other make up.  I can't say enough good stuff about this product. I have recommended it to a lot of my clients. I'm a licensed aesthetician and my face tends to occasionally break out in the chin area from hormonal acne, and I feel that this product does not cause breakouts. It does not make my skin oily.  It's really fantastic.  I wish they had trial sizes so everybody could try it.  It definitely gives the skin a nice glow, it's not like glazed doughnut glow, it's just a nice glow which makes the skin look so luminous and healthy.  Its like you're back from a two week vacation in the Bahamas. 
It looks like you're wearing nothing, bottom line it just makes your skin look healthy, even and it feels great on the skin. * I bought this since it was cruelty-free and being over 50, my once oily/combo skin became so dry this Winter that my previous foundation (CC Matte and Estee Lauder double-wear) wouldn't go on smoothly (more like clay). This product went on smoothly, felt good and was buildable. However, it rubbed off on everything. I tried a primer and finishing powder but even hours later, if I brushed up against my coat/jacket/hoodie collar, or used tissue to blow my nose, or scratched my face, off it came. So I could only recommend this with the caveat that you should bring the product with you to reapply during the day. This would definitely not hold up for warm weather, outdoor activities. Too bad. I will have to look elsewhere."
15,estee lauder,futurist hydra rescue moisturizing foundation spf 45,pimprod2013152,2577966," * I'm not sure if it's the chemical spf or the fragrance but my skin did not agree with the product. I turned red as a tomato and my skin burned and pitched. * I did not like the way it went on, the way it looked and felt on my skin and the way it settled into to lines
 Would not recommend to anyone. * Perfect buildable foundation for mature, dry skin. Leaves a slightly dewy finish. Beautiful! * In the store it looked good on my skin. When I put on a full application it was very heavy and did not sit well on the rest of my skin. * I am not sensitive to smells usually but this one straight up smells like fish oil, like the kind you would take as a supplement.  Can't stand the smell so can't use it. * Love Love!  Blends smoothly & does not settle in creases. Hydrates mature skin. Contains spf to protect your skin all day. The color match for me was absolutely perfect!! Highly recommend this product! * I didn't like it at all. I got the shade matched in the store. It seemed fine, but after one sunny day -while wearing sunscreen and a hat - I got minimally tanned and the shade made me look pale. Considering that this product has SPF 45 it was quite surprising that I tanned. Additionally, this foundation wasn't hydrating at all no matter which moisturizer I used underneath the foundation. My skin felt very dry. I will return the product."

17,pur,4-in-1 love your selfie longwear foundation & concealer,pimprod2005671,2544533," * Love the coverage, couldn't tell if any was on * I'm over 40 and i absolutely love it highly recommend * I really wanted to love this product as much as I loved the clean ingredients. Unfortunately, it added a lot of texture around acne spots. I think also the shade wasn't my exact match but it's really limited in store and didn't want to wait again to not be satisfied so I ended up returning it. * This is the best foundation i have ever tried!!Been using for years!! Every so often i make the mistake of trying something new and always go back, nothing compares. This went on sale about a week ago bought a few to stock up but then i started overthinking and worrying about  why it was on sale, ""was it because were going to discontinue?!"" .. Any whoooo I really never ever write reviews but im just here to say, please dont ever discontinue! * I'm really picky about foundation and it took me years to find one that works for me. I used to be a matte girl because of my super oily skin but as I've gotten older i have too many lines and crepes for that to look good anymore. Couple that with the fact that everything makes me break out and it's impossible to find a good match until this! This strikes the balance between dewy and matte so I have a youthful glow without looking like a grease slick. It lasts well if I set it with powder and I love that it works as concealer too. The dual purpose applicator is great. The fact that it goes by undertone makes the color match the best i have found. I haven't had issues with breakouts either! Perfection! * It moves and settles into the creases around my eyes and shows every pore. I hate it. * I have been using this foundation for years. It was recommended by someone at Ulta. I try other foundations out there just to see if there is a better one and I always end uo back at this one. I tried the Estee Lauder double wear just because everyine raved and it did not look or stay any longer or better than this one so returned it and went back to this. Love this foundation. Its overall a great one!"
18,it cosmetics,cc+ cream natural matte foundation with spf 40,pimprod2044261,2621797," * I have oily skin and maybe this is not meant for my type of skin, but it did not work for me.
It did not remain matte and by mid-day the foundation looked thin and patchy. * I think this looks great! I applied with a damp sponge and it did not look cakey at all. So easy to apply and looks beautiful. * They changed the formula.  I have very oily skin and it didn't  do anything for matte.  And it separated after a hour. * Ive tried everything to make this work and it's still bad. I use primer, powder, setting spray. I noticed the shade was too warm for me so i corrected it with blue corrector and it actually oxidized even worse. Transfers even with powder and setting spray. I dont even have oily skin. Skin looks so textired and patchy. When I apply my blush it makes the foundation come off. * Good coverage overall, gives even complexion. Downside, no matter what primer, skincare prep I do it ALWAYS gets so gross and oily. You literally feel it and need to touch up every hour or else youre a wlaking shiny disco ball. After you touch up, it comes off and gets really patchy and not cute. * I returned this cc cream back to Ulta. I have combination skin, oily in the T-zone. No matter what primer I used, this cream didn't last over 5 hours of wear time without looking blotchy. * I do love the IT cc full coverage.  I am 60 with old school sun damage, uneven skin tone, redness & old acne scars.  Stays on perfectly until i use make up remover at night.  This foundation helps me feel more confident & beautiful with all the things i did wrong back in the 60s & 70s."

It is not high coverage but that is exactly what i wanted. * i initally tried this in the spring and thought it was too drying for me. i have combo skin so in the colder months, i am extremly dry. i tried it again in the summer and fell in love. it gives great coverage, wears very comfortably, and the finish is more natural so i never looked greasy. would definitely reccomend! * I have tried so, so many skin tints and I always come back to this one. It is by far the best skin tint in my opinion. The coverage is very good for a skin tint (medium coverage) and still looks natural.

It keeps me from having to use so much foundation but still be able to have a beat look. The packaging is really cute and feels good in the hands. I love that it gives a nave natural finish.

Horrible horrible product. * Very light weight, buildable, and looks beautiful on skin! * I was so excited for this product just for it to be patchy, dry my face out and made me look 10x older. Not a fan :( * I really don't like the color choices. I tried two different shades but none of them suited my skin tone. I have warm undertone. Mostly yellow or tan color works best. If you like sheer coverage then it's best for you. I like medium coverage which it supposed to be but not even covers anything. * I usually buy the more high end foundations but figured let me give this a try since I like their other products.

Will definitely be buying more. * beautiful foundation, unfortunately the worst packaging of all time. completely exploded in my makeup bag. had to clean everything. i had to duct tape the lid to the bottle and placed it in a plastic bag. it still leaks. cant use the foundation if theres no foundation to use. ive only used it twice and theres not even half the bottle left. throwing money away, literally."

This made my skin dry and flaky, and I used moisturizer underneath it too. * Beautiful skin tint. Has good coverage and it is easy to blend. I have oily skin, and this product does not make me look greasy at all. It also has a long-lasting effect. * I wanted to love this tint but I'm having a hard time. I got shade 118 initially, and it looked great going on the skin but then I checked the mirror in couple hours, I looked orange. I thought okay, maybe I need lighter shade. Purchased lighter shade, same thing, looked great once applied but turned orange in 2-3 hours. This is a great product in terms of texture and how nicely it blurs imperfections but Maybelline needs to improve the formula so tint doesn't oxidizes so quickly. * Colour wasn't a great match but do-able. In certain areas of my face it looked great and coverage was ideal…my skin but a little better. However it clung to drier areas even with moisturizer and primer, looking patchy. Dropper was also annoying, gunked up the top of the bottle, ended up tossing it. * Let me start off by saying that for YEARS I've used either the It Cosmetics CC Cream (this is actually heavy), Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation (heavy but not as thick as the It CC Cream) and Clinique Even Better Makeup SPF 15. I have also tried the Lancome Foundation in the past and Nars. This skin tint is the BEST ""foundation"" I've ever used. It blends seamlessly into the skin and creates the most natural finish. When you think of skin tint, you think of light coverage BUT dont let this fool you. It is SO lightweight but impeccable coverage. It truly is versatile. If you love a dewy look, then set lightly with powder. If you love a matte look, use a mattify primer and set with your fav setting powder. 

For reference, I have combination skin. I get very dry around my chin which is where I have the most problems with my makeup (gets patchy and clings onto dry spots). I have never had a flawless makeup application. It looks good for one hour then afterwards it starts to do that weird separation. So I figured it was time for something lighter. This stuff is my holy grail and I'm so happy it was recommended to me by my friends. I look more youthful and it gives such a gorgeous glow after 10 hours! I do get oily in the t-zone but the oil breaks through as a slight glow not aome oily slick mess. * I cannot rave enough about how much I love this skin tint! I have SUPER acne prone & oily skin but this product does not break me out. Even after wearing it 12+ hours! LOVE LOVE LOVE it is super lightweight and feels hydrating 😍 * I cannot rave enough about how much I love this skin tint! I have SUPER acne prone & oily skin but this product does not break me out.

28,beautycounter,skin twin featherweight foundation,pimprod2038184,2606483," * I truely like the way the foundation glides on and covers. * I had high hopes for this foundation, considering all the positive reviews, but I found it to be subpar. The smell was absolutely terrible, I found the coverage to be uneven, and after an hour or so of wear, I looked in the mirror and it really exaggerated my fine lines and pores. I for sure would not recommend this foundation to anybody over the age of 35. * This is a no for me. It smells terrible and does not work on my skin. Exaggerates dry spots, separates in oily areas, and looks cakey with any amount of product. I've tried applying with fingers, brushes, and sponges. I'm really disappointed I spent so much on it. Drugstore foundations are much better quality than this one! * This is a difficult foundation to work with, the coverage never looks even to me and it's not buildable. up close, I can see it pills on my skin if I pass the sponge over it more than a couple of times. cream products don't layer over it well - it's hard to blend cream blush, bronzer and highlighter on top and it transfers and moves all over the face. It doesn't really set down, even with powder. I have dry skin and never have issues with uneven coverage or getting a foundation to set down, with or without setting powder. I'm just not a fan, I have wet n wild, Catrice, urban decay and Pat McGrath foundations that all perform better across the cost spectrum. * This a wonderful foundation. It gives perfect coverage, making my skin look dewy and fresh.   The best part is that it is a clean product, without the bad stuff.I love this brand. * Not enough coverage for my aging skin! * Unsure. It's not like it's a bad product. I feel it's good quality. I think maybe for a lighter foundation could be a good find. I feel for the price, what my expectations were; not a good buy necessarily. Fell a bit flat for me. I've also only used a couple (2-3) times. Maybe it grows. My skin feels nice.
I don't feel excited afterwords-if that makes sense? Sometimes I put on foundation and I'm like ""OO-Hello there!"" I put this on and feel like…ehh. Best way I can put it. I did have a more positive prospective when adding a glow enhancer. It's ok."

I give it a 4 because it is not teven remotely transfer proof! But if it looks good on the skin then I can live with that! * This is the perfect foundation for the girls that want full coverage but not a thick or cakey feel! This literally leaves your skin looking flawless & smooth! Love it so much! * It's awesome lightweight and goes on smoothly and it doesn't feel caked on. * I received a free sample of this and was impressed by thr coverage without it feeling heavy or looking caked on. It blends well with a brush and a little goes a long way. The color does oxidize so it helps to test it. I used the find my shade feature on the Ulta site based on another foundation I use and it matched it perfectly. I tested it at the store just to be sure as well. * It blends so perfectly with my skin, it doesnt look like i'm wearing makeup. It's very lightweight, but the coverage is fantastic. * I tried this foundation, Its wonderful if you like full coverage. For myself i don't need much coverage I just like a little color. I found it to be to cakey and thick so I returned it, Not for me.I like tinted BB cream. But i love all the eye colors and powders they have. Top Tier!!!!"

If you're looking to cover blemishes or uneven skin tone completely, this product won't be a great fit for you. As layering it doesn't always yield the desired effect, and you might still see some imperfections peeking through. Overall, it's not quite what I hoped for. * It melts off of my skin. I was a loyal customer and now I have to find a different foundation to buy. Such a disappointment. 32 hours? Who is sleeping in their foundation. * I have very fair skin with a pink undertone. I struggle to find reasonably priced foundation that has a pink undertone so I don't look like a pumpkin. I like how there was minimal patchiness and looked very smooth. I added a little powder and perfection. * I got the shade 410 ivory and idk maybe its just me but it looks a little orange on me?? but i really liked how it looks on my skin and the finish it gives and its the lightest shade for me but im gonna try it again and see how i feel ladies and its not a heavy makeup feelings so thats good * I love the coverage and match of this product.  It goes on easily and feels light and natural.  This is a must have necessity in my routine. * Change back to the 24HR ingredients this one makes my skin break out terribly and this is the only foundation I've ever known😭😭😭💔 * I was so pleasantly surprised by this foundation.

This foundation settles into each and every crack. My face looks caked. I'm extremely disappointed. I'm actually hoping that ulta might exchange it for something else. * This is not a better replacement for the old formula. The old gave a nice finish & never clung to dry patches.

It doesn't feel heavy and offers skin protection as well. * Changed the formula. It's horrible. Switched to a different brand. Very disappointed. * This new formula is horrible. So upsetting.

This has a great real skin finish and you only need a little. My normal hormonal breakouts are not hanging around as long as previous and thats thanks to the niacinamid and willowbark.
I get so many compliments on this! * By far the best I tried * This serum foundation is absoluteoy beautiful. I bought it on a whim at regukar price. I am so happy to have a back up on sale price! I am 42 with dry to normal skin type. The coverage is medium but buildable. The texture is so silky, comparable to an $87 designer foundation. I am conpletely blown away by this foundation! You will not regret trying it out! * I received this as a Diamond gift, and I'm relieved I didn't spend money on it. It felt like I was applying pure oil to my face, leaving me looking greasy. By the end of the day, I even noticed a blemish. Definitely a pass for me. * I am a very oily person however I always powder and set and can at least last for about 3-4 hours before I have to blot. This felt heavy on the skin immediately and I could feel the grease within an hour. Not oily but GREASY within the hour. Couldnt wait to wash my face off. Their loose powder however is very blurring and oil controling love that stuff * I've been on the hunt for a new foundation, and finally found it! I wanted a longwearing foundation that would last 12 hours or more. To simplify this, its non cakey, doesn't separate, and looks flawless on the skin * This foundation belongs in the trash. It only lasts for maybe 20 minutes then separates and falls off the face."

At first I found this foundation drying and slightly chalky feeling. But, once I mixed one pump with one drop of argan oil on the back of my hand, it magically became a true serum foundation for mature skin. Anyone feeling it is too dry or matte for mature skin should try that trick. I loved the other ingredients this serum had, and once I figured out the perfect application, I loved it! * I went into Ulta and was told that the Even Better Refresh was being discontinued!  I was so upset as Ive been using it for years and love it. I decided I would give this one a try. Let me start off by saying I am an esthetician and professional makeup artist so I have used many products. When I first put this on I had high hopes but soon discovered the color changed and the foundation changed on my skin. It looked horrible within 30 min. Why cant a company leave well enough alone!  I guess I will have to change from using Clinique. So disappointed! * I love the product, just wish it were more affordable. * I am 54 and wanted some coverage. This is a great product!! Not too heavy and lasts all day * I had to switch from MAC studio fix foundation after they switched to a new matte liquid.  The new  studio fix foundation damaged my skin and the team at Ulta's Brass Mill location in Waterbury were so patient t and helpful. CLINIQUE IS LIFE!! * I'm so upset I bought this online,  feels so dry on skin color is horrible couldn't get it off my face , I love clinique but this foundation is absolutely trash"
39,natasha denona,hy-glam powder foundation,pimprod2044289,2624364," * This powder looks really great. It is a very high price point though. I only bought it since I am in love with powder foundation. The thing is the color range for brown girls isn't that great. The color I got is a little too light. The color after this one is way too red. I am more a golden undertone. Even though the color isn't perfect on me; I will make it work with a darker contour and blend heavily. I love this powder and don't want to return it just because the color is a little off. If you are dry this powder won't work because it's even more drying in the skin. * This powder foundation is my favorite. You can apply it sheerly, but some powder foundations you cannot apply sheerly the way you can this one. However, is it really worth $55?- No.  You can go through it very quickly. In general a bottle of foundation lasts much longer than a compact of powder foundation, and that is true for this one. I probably will not repurchase because I can blow through this stuff, even applied very lightly, in a very short period of time. * No, I didn't drop it or was rough opening or cloding but it snapped off like nothing. Now when i open or close i have to be extremely careful the powder doesn't slip out. 
As for the powder its good. Offers full coverage but can look cakey if reapplied. Lasts about 6 hrs (with setting spray) before it starts to separate a little on thr face. Especially t-zone area. * I really wanted to like this, and the reviews led me to believe that I definitely would. I have combination skin, I'm very pale, and I'm over 40. This was absolutely awful. Cakey, patchy, and settled way more into fine lines than my previous liquid foundation did. Didn't stay on even with my setting spray either. A total miss for me. * Wow, this is the best powder foundation I have ever used and I mean ever I've been a make up artist for years and I have never seen a formula so beautiful on any type of skin. The colors are phenomenal. The range is beautiful. The formula is so blendable and buildable. It's beautiful on top of foundation for setting face. It's beautiful with Mac strobe cream… and other tinted moisturizers. Sometimes I'll use with a powder puff. I don't use the sponge it comes with even on myself. It's a little heavy carries too much product, but sometimes I will use a smaller loose, fluffy brush, especially in the t zone and a powder puff for setting the face. It is beautiful. If you have textured skin, it might seem a little heavy therefore you should use maybe a lighter brush so it doesn't bulk up on your skin, but that has nothing to do with formula. It's just customer error. It doesn't break me out. I am ultra sensitive. I can't use anything with talc in it and this is absolutely perfect. She needs to make a bronzer with this formula or a contour powder because it's probably the only face powder that doesn't break my skin out. * Ive been so on the fence about purchasing this product but my god im so glad i went for it- this is thee most beautiful powder ive ever used , the way i used this product was placing it in the areas i tend to press powder so under the eyes , around the mouth area just to set my concealer and brighten certain areas . Using just a bit it's perfect since its such a buildable formula it has insane coverage with minimal product on the brush . If youre looking for a smooth almost blurred undereye … GIVE IT A TRY!! Note : i have very dry sensitive skin . * I have enjoyed using powder foundations off and on since high school especially when traveling and needing to get out of the house quickly. However, they are not the best for aging skin that is becoming more dry. This is the first and only powder foundation I have ever used that actually looks like a liquid in that it looks Fresh and skin like with a healthy natural finish. I can get solid medium coverage with this with the use of a fluffy brush, a flat top brush and a pencil brush for any freckles or blemishes. Every time I use this, someone tells me my skin looks amazing. I've already bought two backups. I have a fair slightly pink neutral complexion and I wear N1. I highly recommend!"

By day, two, the drying effect that this had on my skin, I have never seen before with any other product! My skin looks so dehydrated and dry. I use fabulous skin care and hydrating plumping primers. I never had this problem before with another foundation. So sad because like I said, the first time I used it it looked really beautiful on the skin. I can't believe they advertise this as hydrating. Loaded with alcohol.  :( * I stopped wearing foundation a few years ago and have been more about tints or spot concealing. I saw alot of great reviews. Mind you I'm in my mid 30s and have combo skin. I don't prep my skin(I'm ashamed) lol but i apply about two drops on each side of my face directly to the skin and use my fingers to blend in. I do think its buildable, it feels wet when applied and sets and dries similar to a cream. I've received lots of compliments, it looks like skin but better, just evens things out. This is exactly what I was looking for, something light and natural looking. Also, I am able to apply blush and bronzer as usual without issue. 
Con: There's limited shade ranges I wish they would have a bigger variety for those in between colors. I can see a potential problem with the applicator but I haven't had an issue (less is more) * I am 44, I have tried sooo many different foundations.  I will probably wear this one until I die.  Its that good.  I have decent skin, starting to show some age though.  I have super dry skin so most foundations just look heavy and cakey ans settle into everything.  I hate having to do a leimwr ans then foundation then powder just to look half way decent.  This gives just the right amount of coverage to even my skin tone.  What I love the most is for a lightweight hydrating foundation, IT STAYS PUT!  No need to use a primer or set it with powder which adds to my dryness.  The color range is not great, fortunately for me 2-3 works perfect for winter and 4-5 for summer. Oh and the dropper sucks.  I took a pump off an empty bottle of another foundation that works perfect!  Problem solved there. * I normally wear Armani Luminous Silk foundation but was looking for a lighter foundation/serum that looks as good and I actually think this serum looks better! The color match is great and the serum looks very smooth and bright. Excellent product and highly recommended! * I normally wear Armani Luminous Silk foundation but was looking for a lighter foundation/serum that looks as good and I actually think this serum looks better!

Maybe it's just my skin but a big NO from me * If you have very dry skin and you do not have adequate hydration it is definitely not for you .but if you have a skin care routine it will look beautiful I have extra dry skin but always hydrate my skin and I have no complaints worth what it has * totally reccomend, it makes my face looks like i have a filter on * totally reccomend, it makes my face looks like i have a filter on * The smells alone makes me gag! * Although it is full coverage, the look resulted in a dry, cakey finish on my skin.

43,it cosmetics,your skin but better foundation + skincare,pimprod2017112,2568683," * First  foundation that actually matched my skin, literally covers everything ans stays on, i wanted to love it but on my first try I noticed dry brown patches after I cleaned my face and  was very dry, not for me 😞 * I love this foundation, it is very lightweight so I had to use a heavy moisturizer and thick primer. It worked well with both NYX and Provedence drugstore primers.

Also my deep skin discoloration are covered with a tiny amount. I use liquid bronzer and blush with it and it pairs well with Pacifica and Maybelline liquid products. Once this foundation dries on your skin, it will break up if you add liquid or oil makeup on top- but as long as I do it all at one it sets the makeup and last for my work day. 

FYI I set my face with pixi skin veil and it wasn't too drying on my dry skin. They recommended I get a shade lighter foundation to cover and it gave me full coverage. The only con is my local Ulta doesn't sell it so I have to buy online. * this is so watery I don't even know how you're supposed to apply it. I wore it for one day and within a few hours started developing a severe rash on my skin that has lasted for several days. would not recommend. * I'm obsessed with this foundation! You don't feel like you are wearing anything! It's life changing! * This is actually a first… I've never experienced a foundation that manages to be extremely watery, yet also cakey at the same time. Unsure what kind of mystery this is, because it's certainly not a good one. Color was also extremely off and orange. Also more on the natural matte side, NOT radiant like it says. * This foundation does exactly what it says,"" Your skin but better"". Absolutely love this foundation. * I wanted to try a light product, but once i applied it, it was a weird textire. I already have oily skin so it made my face very shiny, which was not what i wanted. It also made me break out terribly and unfortunately cause scars on parts of my face."

I'm on the hunt for my wedding foundation, and I think I have found the winner. This foundation really is flawless, like the name suggests. I have some lines on my forehead and scabs everywhere most of the time. This foundation never sinks into my forehad lines or causes my scabs to flake or stand out. It conceals magnificently. I prime/prep with my normal skin care routine. After foundation, I set with the new Fenty setting spray and sometimes add on the saie translucent loose setting powder to my lines. This dream combination lasts all day and is almost completely transfer proof. 

I am ghostly pale and very cool toned. My only frustratuon is that the lightest shade (1C1) goes on as the PERFECT shade, then dries down darker and more warm. Laura Mercier, PLEASE expand your shade range or look into the dry down,  because this formulation is unmatched! * Feels so light a fresh feeling on my face * I usually wear higher end foundation with a heftier price tag, but this is a dream. So blendable, medium coverage, and so skin like. Pair it with the brands luminescent finishing powder and feel like a supermodel! * Being that there were mixed reviews, decided to give a try for myself. However, i did have high expectations but unfortunately I ended up being disappointed. This foundation, in my opinion, is for normal, pore less skin.  If you have texture and large pores, this will definitely enhances those features. * I am a 48 year old with combination skin. This foundation goes on smooth and hides pores without looking cakey. A little goes a long way. I use one pump, sometimes a half pump for my entire face and neck. It feels extremely light and lasts all day. I recommend. * I have struggled for years to find a color that can do what this does and be light yet with coverage. Amazing!!! I love it! * It's very light way the first time you put it on. It seems like you're not putting anything on because it's that light but it has good coverage and it feels good in your face. Also, we can last all day."

However, even on bad application days, a couple hours later I'm always amazed by how amazing my skin looks. * This goes on light and smooth. Gives nice coverage when you want to look natural.

An ULTA assistant pointed me in the direction of Laura Mercier's tinted moisturizer with SPF, which has been great (I'm on my third tube—each has lasted me about 9 months with daily use). I like how this product lightly balances out redness, gives a subtle glow, doesn't bother my skin, and is breathable. * I'm very picky when it comes to base makeup. I have dry/normal skin, a light-medium olive skintone, and I deal with dullness/discoloration. Shade 2N1 is a good shade match for me. I've enjoyed using this with a dense foundation brush. It's easy to sheer out or build up. I would describe it as light/medium coverage. It evens out my skin tone, but doesn't cover blemishes. Its very comfortable on the skin, it feels like a moisturizer, the consistency is thick at first, but it doesn't feel like anything when blended out. I can wear it without powder and it stays on all day for me. Definitely repurchasing. * I've been using this product for years!  I don't like thick heavy coverage so this is very light buildable coverage.  I have pretty good skin, 38 years old, cheeks are pink from dryness with few blemishes and this provides me full coverage.  I do add a thin layer of moisturizer (especially now that I'm older and less oily) and concealer for under my eyes, nose and any glaring blemishes.  It's a very natural finish that does pull warm.  I use 2N1 for my winter everyday color and 2W1 for summer when I'm tanned (it's very yellow/gold). * The Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer goes on nicely,  bur doesnt cover ANY imperfections. Some pilling.  I was hoping to love it, but will be returning it."

If you're combo to oily you def need a mattifying primer and/or setting spray. It's skin like and smells divine, definetly a luxury scent. If you're sensitive to fragance keep that in mind. * I loved this formula. It truly is long wearing, but you can't feel it. I didn't notice oxidation. My problem is that the lightest neutral and cool shades are still too dark. * Smooth & silky * This foundation has such a strong scent that it triggered my allergies and gave me a headache. I tried it for 3 days before returning it. Its light coverage but looks patchy on my combo skin. I wore it for 4 hours then on the last 2 days 9 hours and it looked so bad no powder could fix it.

I wouldnt hate this product if i didnt spend so much for what its worth. * Love this foundation * Nice, light foundation. Doesn't feel heavy on my skin. * I love it. It was my first try for a stick foundation. Good coverage. But if youre a everyday makeup person at least for me it didnt last a year i think overall i had it for 4-5 months lol. So its good if you dont often need a lot to use * It's expensive but worth it. I wear it everywhere, to work as a nurse and beyond. Its the perfect amount of matte/satin finish. I have dry flaky skin and occasional acne. Under it I wear estee advanced night repair serum, peptide eye cream, cocokind electrolyte cream, gel sunscreen, and loreal lumi glotion. Love the brush. Worried about keeping it hygienic but thinking an occasional dainty wash or spraying alcohol on it will suffice"

However, matching to my skin has been a challenge...it took three color match sessions and still not right.  I use it lightly to avoid a weird color look.  too bad because it is a really good product. * I love it sooo much it's light weight and good coverage but still looks like healthy glowing skin for me and I am obsessed with it * I just bought this ! I barely have used and its gone already!? For such an expensive product you would think it would last longer. Such a waste. And NO I do not use a ton when doing make up. * I love Lancôme as a brand but PLEASE bring out more shades. I bought the wrong shade off the site but went in store to swatch them and even the lightest shade in the foundation wasn't even close to light enough for me, and im not usually the lightest shade in foundations. The model pictures dong seem to be accurate. It seems you don't have many deep shades either. It was supposed to be a cool tone foundation (they were out of my neutral shade) but it was VERY warm. I like the finish but I can't repurchase due to this shade range :( ill have to mix a color correcter in to help the color. * Pros
- natural looking medium coverage
- glow finish isn't too glowy or oily-looking

Cons
- shades do not match the Teint Idole Ultra Wear matte formula (new or old). Teint Idole (both matte and glow) have been my primary foundation for years and since the reformulation, I have gone through several bottles trying to find my new shade match in each one and have resorted to buying multiple shades and mixing my own. 310N in the matte formula is closest to my palest winter shade. 310N in the glow formula is too peachy.  
- foundation is no longer transfer-proof (!!) and fades throughout the day
 
I am disappointed in all the changes and this purchase will unfortunately be my last for this product * I purchase Lancome Foundation during the half price day on line to try out.  I followed the recommendations on Find your match comparing with what I am now using.  I usually wear NARS but I wanted to try Lancome.  Sadly, match not exactly the same."
56,about-face,the performer skin-focused foundation,pimprod2043010,2618950," * This foundation had 0 coverage, made me feel like i had grease on my face and broke down very fast, i dont even have oily skin. Also the applicatior was very inconvenient in my opinion. i dont get the hype what so ever * i decided to try this a few months back, and it has definitely become my go to!! i have pretty dry skin, and this does a pretty good job at keeping it hydrated. the coverage is definitely lighter which i prefer, but it can be built up. the finish is natural/a bit dewy, but not so much that it looks greasy. also works great with all my other products. i am a fan!! * This foundation has by far been the BEST foundation I have ever tried. 
I had given up on foundation. Felt like the make up wore me, not i wore the make up. All other foundations / skin tints i have used emphasized my pores, any dry patches, settle into lines, and in about maybe an 30 mins they ALL look soooo dry and cakey. As well as the color match never being right. 
But this foundation has proven itself. It has the perfect green undertone (F2OLIVE) that i have never been able to find ANYWHERE, and some how makes your skin look poreless. The finish is a glowy skin like finish. It last all day and very flexible in the coverage.  If you want less coverage, apply less, you want more, you get full coverage. It's very versatile. 
It makes me want to stock pile it and hope they never re formulate it. 👏🏻 * I am just about to need a replenishment on my first bottle of F2 Olive. This foundation is amazing! Skin-like, flexible, natural finish, and lightweight. F2 Olive is a PERFECT match for me!!! THANK YOU for creating a shade for us fair, unsaturated olives!!! * First foundation I have tried that I truly love. * I've struggled for years finding my perfect foundation match bc of my olive skin. I got the shade F2Olive & it is my perfect match. Finally! I was shocked at it basically disappeared into my skin. The formula is on the semi-matte creamier side so i mix in an essence to thin it out & make it more liquidy & lightweight. I'll never buy a different foundation! * The shades are awesome and does not oxidize. LOVE IT"

I love how it doesn't feel like you're wearing any foundation and it gives me that natural dewy skin. * I would totally recommend it to those who love buildable medium coverage foundation. Works great with hollywood filter and my skin looks flawless in this foundation. * Acne brone skin and this doesnt break me out. I wish there was a lighter shade because this is a bit dark but i mix another foundation with it. * I have dry skin and have been using a pump this either brushed on or patted on with a beauty blender for a year now. I make sure to moisturize and let my sunscreen settle down first, then apply. Sometimes I use the same brush and use sweep it across my under eye and across my lids just to even things out a bit. I am fortunate to have clear skin with very small pores so there isn't a ton to cover other than some redness on my cheeks. The narrow tube with a pump is also fits more easily into a makeup bag than a chunky bottle and I don't worry about dropping and breaking it. I just wish it were a little less expensive or a larger volume for the price. * This foundation is so luminous and has great coverage.   A little goes a long way but it lasts all day. * I've been using Charlotte Tilbury's Beautiful Skin Foundation, and it's seriously a game-changer. It gives me that glowy, natural finish without feeling heavy – like my skin, just way more radiant. I love how it evens everything out while still looking fresh! * I would use this product again."
58,dior,dior forever foundation fluid matte,pimprod2036825,2604875," * I am 55 and have combination skin. This foundation is my favorite. Of course, I wear skincare and SPF underneath which keeps it from being too matte. I use a little setting powder in my T zone, and it lasts until I take off my makeup. I have never once had a problem with it transferring to my clothing, but I wear a light shade, so maybe the richer shade pigments are different. I have also worn this in all seasons with no issues. I will definitely repurchase. * It's been a struggle to make this foundation work on my 53yo menopausal skin. These are my tips that can make it beautiful if you have skin like mine.  Use a good but lightweight moisturizer. I found that Vanicream works best. And a hydrating primer is a must. I use Tarte Double Duty Base Tape Hydrating Primer. In my opinion, this looks better blending with your fingers instead of a brush or sponge. And use the smallest amount possible cause it goes from zero to cakey in a blink. And I would say not to use powder. Occasionally, I will use just the lightest kiss of the hourglass powder but it's a risk, and honestly it sets well without powder. I work 12 hour shifts at night so my makeup is on usually 18 hours and this stuff lasts better than anything, with only a little touchup needed at the end of the day. * I really have oil skin and this base makes my makeup look naturak but feels matte i really loke it * The foundation is amazing! It is perfect full coverage withou feeling ir kooking heavy. I have oily skin and this gives me a matte finish. Pricey but worth it! * Words can describe how much love I have for this foundation. As an oily skin girly, i love the matte finish. Will definitely buy again and again. * My skin tends to be sensituve, and I used this foundation thinking this product and the ingredients were the best because it's ""Dior"". After using it for a few days (before realizing it was the problem), my face brone out in hives and cystic acne that unlike anything I have ever experienced. It was so bad, I didn't leave my house for a week! Now I am left with scars on my face that could take years to recover from. I dont know if it's the ethylhexyl salicylate, alcohol, or mystery frangance in this ish, but I wouldn't wish what happened to me on my worst enemy. Dont touch this stuff with a 10 ft pole!!!

I'm trying not to hold it against ""Dior"" or Ulta, but the fact that they're even letting this stuff stay on the market baffles me. Dont use this. * If you have tried the YSL matte foundation and you're looking for a less expensive version this is it! It smells amazing, has the SPF and stays on matte. I live in AZ where if is hot and this does not feel heavy or cakey."

It looks dry, flakey, and inconsistent. I used primer and my sponge was wet. I also tried doing it without primer with a wet sponge, and also a dry sponge with no luck. Super disappointed that a bottle of decently expensive foundation is going to waste 😭. The only pro of this is foundation is that it doesn't cause acne. * A great color match. Easy on my acne prone skin. So glad this product is available. A dream come true for me. Also covers up roscea like magic. I have a darker version for the summer months. This color I am writing about will get used when there isn't much sun in Ohio. * I love this foundation! It is so good for my skin type (sensitive and some spotting) it has a medium coverage but you can defined build it up. * Use to love this. It oxidizes right to orange. For reference I was using 10 Alabaster. * I have used this product for years. It made my skin look amazing. Within the last six months something has changed in the formula. Now after application my face looks cakey and orange. Please go back to the original formula! Now I am going to be on the search for a new foundation. * nothing blends better with my skin as this one does!!! Its insane. Would repurchase * New formula is orange :("

Although it checked both of these wants off of my list, I would not recommend this product if you have oily, textured skin like I do. I found the product is light and easy to apply, but accentuates all of the texture and pores on my face. I've also noticed the product slips around my oily skin after just a few hours of wear. Unfortunately I wouldn't reccomend if you have oily, textured skin. * I HATE how foundation feels on my skin and when it looks cakey. But this one doesnt feel heavy at all and looks sooooo natural. Only foundation I use * It's a very light foundation and powder * I wanted to love this product. It was good coverage and a great color match. Unfortunately after a few hours it made my skin so, so oily. It was like being a teenager again. * It matches my skin tone perfectly and doesn't look like have anything on * I love the way it looks on me natural, compliments, my skin * I've been struggling finding a foundation ghst sctually sits on my skin beautifully without creasing or gettinf patchy and this is it! My skin goes through changes constantly with weather and such and this works well in winter and summer! It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin and it covers my butterfly radh from lupus!

Like, I bought myself some a while ago, but have since run out. I don't know what shade it is, and it doesn't seem to say on the bottle. Can someone help me out? * I have nothing else to say but love thisss!!!! * [I received this product in exchange for my honest review] Unfortunately, my correct skin tone did not get sent to me so I am unable to use this product. If I'm putting it on my skin as a contour, the product dissolves in my skin easily but have to mix it with lighter tone * Absolutely love this foundation. Its lightweight, yet has the full coverage i prefer. I will say it does oxidize a little dark, so i recommend buying a shade lighter than your normal. * It's amazing ! I've been looking for a glowy but coverage foundation and this is exactly what I was looking for definitely will repurchase. * I originally picked this up because I ran out of my Armani foundation (shade 5) and needed something to use while waiting for a new bottle. I got shade 185 and was really impressed with how well it matched my skin.

I have light combination skin, and this didn't cling to any dry patches or separate—even around my nose, which is rare! It didn't completely cover my redness, but it's definitely buildable. It dries down nicely. I was a little nervous at first because it looked really glowy, but it settled into a natural finish that still kept a nice healthy glow.

I wore this for the most part on its own and had great results. Rare Beauty's contour and Tarte's liquid blush both blended really well over it. I also used Milani's setting spray before and after applying, and the foundation stayed in place all day.

This is definitely going to be my go-to for everyday wear. Since my Armani foundation is more of a splurge, I'll be saving that for work or special occasions. * This is a great product, however it is extremely luminous and sheer, which I don't usually like. Would be great for someone who likes a luminous, glowy base!"
63,hourglass,veil hydrating skin tint,pimprod2040571,2611435," * I have really dry skin and this skin tint does wonders! I read some reviews and learned that it can separate and seem blotchy but as a extremely dry skin girly, I used water based products only and it changed the game. This is shade 3 with neutral undertones. I paired it with the too faced ethereal light concealer in milkshake! * I have very very dry skin so face products can be hit or miss. This is a hit! Doesn't cling to dry spots and has a dewy finish. Decent coverage too! * Broke me out really bad * Broke me out really bad * I have used Mac makeup for years. I do not wear heavy makeup and prefer a more natural made up look. I originally went to Ulta to try a different foundation i saw on TikTok shop but the attendant recommended I try Hourglass in stead. Best decision ever. I now no longer will use MAC after over 25+ years. This skin tint is so light but gives your skin a nice moisturized, glowy coverage without any blending effort. And all you need is just a little drop and this stuff goes far. Lets not mention the match was 100% I was shocked. Most foundations have to be matched with a color up or down to find your closest match. I now have a couple ranges for the different seasons. Absolutely recommend! * I was so excited to try this because of all its hype.. but it pills bad on me and separates. Ive tried multiple different ways to skin prep, from my normal routine to completely dry skin. Dry skin usually gives me the best results, but still sometimes will pill. So sad because I thought this would work perfect for my skin. * I love this. I use it every day for my look for school. I have some pretty bad acne scarring, so I use concealer over and under, but it melts together perfectly with everything. About to repurchase too :)"

It doesn't stay on if I want to travel with it in my makeup bag, and I've dropped the bottle by picking it up by its 2.5""lid several times.   Packaging needs work.   I'd only refer it to a friend with the warning about poor ability to close it and keep the pump sanitary. * I liked this foundation a lot! It matched my skin tone really well, and is a really affordable price. It's a nice size, and usually lasts me over four months to finish. The only bad thing is that it takes a while to blend in and I find myself having to go over it with a beauty blender or brush a lot. I do still really like it though and it covers up many imperfections. * The best foundation ever!!!!!! * Patchy, greasy , I was disappointed ☹️ * Great price so, I thought to give it a try. It's not a bad foundation but not one that squeals excitement. Blends pretty well but after a while it seems to pool into lines and makes imperfections noticeable. Would probably be a good product for dry skin * I like how it blends out and has the perfect coverage for everyday use. * I like how it blends out and has the perfect coverage for everyday use."

It wears really well through the day. Easy to work with. Im oily and red around my nose and its the best my makeup has looked after wearing for a day! Didnt make it through my workout, but I have never met a foundation that could handle my oils and sweat! It lasted better than all the others I have tried. * I was extremely hesitant to try this because I have normal to dry skin and don't like anything too matte. I picked it up when it was 50% off because the waterproof self setting claims were hard to pass up. This is seriously the most skin-like foundation I own. It blends like a dream with a brush. It's blurring. It's super light weight. It does self set but doesn't look dry or cling to dry spots. It lasts all day (i usually wear makeup for 14+ hours). Powders, creams, and liquids all go on very nicely over it. I do set lightly with powder and setting spray because that is my preference but I could get away without it. With setting, it wears like iron under a mask as well. I haven't been able to get more than medium coverage but that's what I typically prefer anyway. * I have fibally foubd a replacement for the discountinued Born this Way Matte in the glass jar.  Ive tried many and thisbisbthe closest I've come.  Lasted all day and didnt crack or crease.  It does transfer if you don't set it.  So I would suggest settinf it despite whar they say.  Butbi am happy i found thia! * This is my favorite, stay all day, light as air foundation. * I love this foundation.  It has been my go to for years, but i have  recently quit buying it due to the lid.  It was constantly popping odd and getting all over my make uo bag and making a huge mess.   I hope they change the packaging for it asap * This foundation is mid I bought on sale during the 21 days of beauty and used it with and without powder. With powder definitely got cakey and started to crack in certain areas, but this product is pushed as ""self setting"". When used without powder get the same effect as a dewy foundation in my opinion I just looked sweaty instead of dewy. You can get the same effect with the maybelline dewy foundation for alot cheaper * love it"

The light beige is the best color match I've ever had for my cool skin tone. The only drawback is I wish it wasn't so expensive. * Love this product. Light weight. Comfortable and covers nicely. Just blurs the imperfections without looking like a mask. I have freckles so this is perfect. * Giving this 5 stars even though I will be returning it. I recently figured out that I am sensitive to Zinc Oxide sunscreen, which explains why this broke me out, even though its ingredients are so minimal and acne safe. I got itchy and developed a few pimples from wearing this. HOWEVER! This is an amazing foundation, and I am so upset that it has to leave my collection. It's a powder, but it's almost creamy on the skin and blurred the flaky texture on my cheeks. The coverage was a perfect medium but could be built up. I am combination dry and acne prone, and without the zinc oxide, this would've been my forever foundation. * I never thought I'd become a powder foundation girl, but I'm obsessed with this foundation! It blends so well, I have oily, textured, fuzzy haired skin and always stayed away from powder foundations, until I couldn't take the oily mess from liquid foundations anymore and gave this one a try! My eyes are very sensitive, and I was baffled my how much I loved this foundation. I apply over my moisturizer and lasts all day.

Only cons: can't color match at Ulta stores, and a bit pricey - but so worth it! * I've used this makeup for years. I love that it is light buildable coverage with SPF protection. * It goes on very smooth and covers well. It doesn't give me any reactions all day like it's not even there. Most others I'm itching or just want to take it off mid day. * Love this foundation.  I have tried three different colors and they all work.  The lightest one I use in the Winter.  This is so easy to apply and looks great on.  To set, which really helps with a powder foundation, I just mist with water.  The refillable compact is great too."

My face is not oily is more dry i use a hydrating moisturizer but not working for me * Extremely hydrating and moisturizing. Exactly what I was looking for!! ❤️ * I'm Asian fair/light neutral skin and olive overtone, and for reference my PERFECT shade is Estée Lauder's 1W2 Sand; even though the Dior glow foundation doesn't have my color (1.5N was too pink and 1.5W was juuuuust a bit too yellow), I fell in love with the formula the first time i tried it - it was instant natural but impressive coverage, with just pea size product on my brush! And this formula is extremely glowy, so a litte definitely goes a Loooong way. 
I have also been mixing this foundation with lighter BB cream to create my own shade, its been great - the glow stayed on ALL DAY. In comparison, Estée Lauder is just a bit smoother and matte. 
Hope this helps! * I like this foundation, I would love it if my skin werent so problematic. If you have no acne or discoloration im sure this will be great for you! It has a nice glowy look without looking oily. It did not separate or settle into pores! Definitely worth a try * I really like this foundation. I feel like it has such a pretty glowy finish. I like the dewy finish even though I have oily skin so I do start to look oily much faster but still very pretty. I would love this product much more if it didnt transfer!

68,anastasia beverly hills,"medium coverage, natural finish luminous foundation",pimprod2008586,2551421," * This is one of my go to foundations for the winter when i get a little paler and a lot dryer. It has amazing buildable coverage, applies nicely, and its one of the few that i can find a true color match in. 
HOWEVER, this needs new packaging. The twist on lid with the pump applicator? Trash. Its always loose, pumps out inconsistent amounts of product and quite frankly for the price point i shouldnt have to worry about that. I cant even travel with it without it spilling in my makeup case…like whats the point if i cant bring it with me when i go out of town?
It honestly needs the new bottle that her new foundation just got (the matte one?) and maybe just have a glossy bottle? 
What do i know im just a consumer 😭😭
Still love the actual product though. * Your cool under tones has to much yellow under tones.. need to make it without adding golden or beige into the mixer never have been able to find a match that didn't look to yellow on me. * I hardly write reviews but this is review worthy. I have acne prone skin.  I also have drier skin as well. I read where people say it's too thin or too heavy. Honestly, it depends on how you build it up. it is build able coverage. If you're seeing texture and fine lines, be sure to set it with powder. Brush the powder off, and finish with a spray. The morphe luminous setting spray pairs like a DREAM. This is the only foundation I will buy ever. If I had the money I'd buy like 10 back ups just incase. I moisturize, prime, conceal, foundation, powder set, set spray. This is how I would layer it. Not including blush, bronzer, contour, etc. Even with added layers I don't believe it's heavy. It very much gives, skin. Because this is infused with skin loving ingredients I can wear this all day. I'm talking a full 12+ hours. Gym, errands, everything and it holds up beautiful. It actually looks better over time. It almost melts into my skin more and just looks even more natural by the end of the night. IT DOES NOT OXIDIZE!! 🥰 There's so many good things I can say about this. My cons, the pump. Over time the pump does stick. That needs worked on. I've bought probably 10 bottles and they all do it over the course of 2 years so I'd say it's for sure the design of the pump. but the formula is worth it but be mindful it can get messy if you don't pull the pump back up. This is worth your money 100% regardless. sometimes we avoid wearing makeup because our skin is broken out, but I actually wear this when I'm breaking out because I swear when I wash it off I feel like my skin is better. * The shade match is amazing but every time Ive tried this foundation it left me feeling horrible about how I look. Ive spent a long time trying tk make this work in MANY different ways, used almost the entire bottle over time because its my backup ""emergency"" foundation. No matter what, my face looks caked and it settles in horribly. No matter how you spin it, it does not look like skin in real life. * The search for the one is over. Great dewy buildable coverage that stays in place, and can be mattified with a powder. A perfect shade match too! * The search for the one is over.

I used it for 15 years! It was the best always made my skin look flawless. This new formula doesnt even come close! Not the same coverage and sits on top of the skin. Should have just made a whole new foundation instead of reformulating a perfect foundation! So sad about this. * It was cakey it barley did anything just made me brake out you extremely light coverage * I've had this for a couple months I've tried everything to make it work for me. I have normal to dry skin. nothing made this look luminous or flexible. dry and flakes as can be amd I've never had this with Mac. * I have been using this for a long time . I have tried others brands but I always go back to this one. * My absolute favorite. I mix it with my moisturizer to thin it out and it always looks beautiful. * I wore Mac Studio fix for years and only switched to try a different brand for a little while. When I realized there was nothing better than Mac Studio fix, I went back and purchased a bottle only to find out that they had completely changed the formula and it was absolutely terrible! It's been ruined! The original made my skin flawless and it lasted beautifully all day and night. This new formula does not last, it separates and creases, it sinks into all my fine lines and pores making my skin look disgusting and it made my skin break out. Very disappointing."

I LUV it!!!!!! * I tried using this over a mineral sunscreen and a chemical sunscreen. Both left dots of the powder foundation settle in my pores, making them more prominent. I had high hopes for this product after seeing reviews, but it didn't work for me. * I use this as concealer under my eyes, on my lids  and to cover dark spots over my light foundation. It works well and lasts all day.  I wouldn't care for it as foundation, but its good concealer. I have 125 Ivory Buff, but will get a lighter shade next time. But this shade is workable. * I had high hops for this as a quick solution to early mornings.  It was very chalky feeling on my skin. * This is a great powder foundation for the price. Has a scent but nothing too overpowering. I hate scented makeup but this one isn't so bad. * I love this product it makes me feel confident cause I know it's going to last me all day. * I love this product. I love the way it covers spots I want it too, love the way it feels on my face not to heavy just light."
73,chanel,les beiges water-fresh tint,pimprod2030055,2574253," * This just got delivered so immediately tried this on fresh clean hydrated skin. Im 35 with normal/dry skin. This went on like butter. Its light, sheer, with a dewy fresh finish. This is going to be perfect for the everyday ""no make up"" look I was after. * Love this! Easy to apply, very light and brightens  my face! * I'm 42, and when it comes to foundation, I'm incredibly picky—there are very few I truly love. I generally prefer skin tints, and I've tried almost all of them, but the Chanel Water Tint is by far the most beautiful one I've ever used. It's sheer, but it enhances the skin in the most natural way! I'm beyond happy with my purchase and can confidently say this will be a forever repurchase for me. It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny. * I love the Chanel line. However, let's be honest it's pricey. When I do buy Chanel products I have never been disappointed. I have purchased a few different Chanel foundations in the past. For years I have been looking for a light coverage foundation that has some staying power. Without hesitation,  this is the BEST foundation I have ever used. It goes on and give you time to manipulate it before it dries down. It goes on without streaks or patchiness. It's so light that I was concerned it wouldn't cover some redness I have. To my surprise,  it covers redness, smoothes out texture and blurs pores. It does all of this while feeling like there is literally nothing on your face. It wears very well and stays on until I remove it at night. So worth the money on this one. * Chanel knows how to do foundations.  This was very light coverage but did even out my skin tone.  It was easy to apply with my fingers.  I have very dry mature skin and this looked nice.  It could also be used as a makeup base before applying another foundation. * I have acne prone skin, and this water fresh tint does not clog pores! It makes your skin glowing and soft, great for cold dry winters. I use the wster fresh touch in the summer for less hydration on humid days and a bit more coverage in the summer! LOVE 
Its a but pricey but you only need a drop for your whole face, and I wait until I have enough points to get it discounted or Free! 😊 * I got a gift card and bought this as an indulgence. Let me start by saying it is very sheer and will not cover any flaws. However, I wanted something for little to know makeup days so I could look alive and this makes skin look absolutely radiant. With a setting spray, it stayed that way all day."
74,clinique,even better refresh hydrating and repairing makeup foundation,pimprod2004194,2541677," * I had high hopes for this foundation since it was described as for very dry mature skin.  Nope, too thick, wrong color choice (my mistake), no matter how lightly I applied it still caked in creases & wrinkles. * Easy application and coverage. * I'm 61. Larger pores than most. Have fine lines & imperfections etc. I have a large supply of foundations. Everything from high-end to drugstore brands. I like full coverage, but I don't like it to feel heavy or settle in my lines. This stuff is awesome! Goes on like silk, covers beautifully and stays all day. I recommended to others who feel the exact same way. This reminds me of a CC cream, but with better coverage. 100% recommend! * I am a 60+ woman and an Ulta sales person recommended this gorgeous make-up, she was absolutely right…hides my pores and does not settle into my fine lines. Thank you so very much! * Have used all the high end foundations and this Clinique foundation is by far the best for full coverage with natural looking finish for sensitive and mature skin types. 
Use small amount with a flat foundation brush over moisturizer and it blends beautifully. Absolutely no cons. * I am really happy with this foundation. It has good coverage and it lasts a pretty long time. * This foundation does not settle into my lines, I love it!"

This foundation has a beautiful finish that (on me) looks even better as my (minimal) natural oils appear by the end of the day. A little goes a very long way! This plays well with my usual skincare/primer/setting products. I keep it in my travel bag so I can always look flawless on trips! * I've been using for four days now and it makes my eyes water all day long it's awful it clays up on your face in a couple hours this product was not for me * Great coverage good color match good lasting coverage * I love this foundation because you get super coverage with very little product and your skin feels light and not at all like some cream foundations.  They have such a great selection of colors that I found a perfect, natural match. * I will buy this again and again.  My original makeup Dermablend was not available from the company so some ladies helped me find this and it's amazing!!! It feels like heaven on my face light and it gives great coverage. * Do NOT use the AI foundation match. It's incorrect and Ulta sent me the wrong shade (literally orange). I had to go in store to correct it due to being locked out of my account and Ulta refusing to let me access it over the phone.The product itself is good, Ulta online is horrible. * I used to have this when I worked at Ulta and repurchased it after decluttering.  I forgot how good it looks."

I have dry to normal and have mature skin . Been wearing for 10 years . Sometimes i switch to others but come back ! Bd21 shade * Got this product because, almost every other brand was out of my shade, but I really like it. It matches perfectly, its the perfect mix of matte and dewy, and it has lasted my whole work day! * This is my favorite foundation.  I love the fact that they have a color for olive undertones!  It goes on smoothly and lasts all day.  I am a Chanel Beauty Advisor and this is my go to foundation for most of my guests! * This foundation is my new holy grail. I have mature skin and i cant get over how flawless my skin looks. I feel like i am not evem wearing foundation. It is long lasting and only slightly settles into fine lines several hours later. I love the glow. I thought Giorgio Armani had a wonderful foundation, but this one definitely topped it! * This foundation is so amazing. I tried it when a Chanel vendor in Ulta tried it on me. I have been sampling this foundation forever cause I didn't want to spend the money for a foundation. Once I had the money I knew eventually I would buy it. It looks so beautiful on my brown skin and it is a perfect color match. I mean literally perfect! I fell in love with it about 6 months ago. For me no it doesn't fade at all on the skin. Yes it is not a full coverage concealer. I don't need full coverage since I have pretty good skin. A little goes a long way with this foundation. I am happy I bought it finally! * Best foundation I've used for aging skin.  Highly recommend. * Love this new foundation I just tired out reminds me of Giorgio Armani L S it's really nice and blurring and light weight"

Unfortunately, it added a lot of texture around acne spots. I think also the shade wasn't my exact match but it's really limited in store and didn't want to wait again to not be satisfied so I ended up returning it. * This is the best foundation i have ever tried!!Been using for years!! Every so often i make the mistake of trying something new and always go back, nothing compares. This went on sale about a week ago bought a few to stock up but then i started overthinking and worrying about  why it was on sale, ""was it because were going to discontinue?!"" .. Any whoooo I really never ever write reviews but im just here to say, please dont ever discontinue! * I'm really picky about foundation and it took me years to find one that works for me. I used to be a matte girl because of my super oily skin but as I've gotten older i have too many lines and crepes for that to look good anymore. Couple that with the fact that everything makes me break out and it's impossible to find a good match until this! This strikes the balance between dewy and matte so I have a youthful glow without looking like a grease slick. It lasts well if I set it with powder and I love that it works as concealer too. The dual purpose applicator is great. The fact that it goes by undertone makes the color match the best i have found. I haven't had issues with breakouts either! Perfection! * It moves and settles into the creases around my eyes and shows every pore. I hate it. * I have been using this foundation for years. It was recommended by someone at Ulta. I try other foundations out there just to see if there is a better one and I always end uo back at this one. I tried the Estee Lauder double wear just because everyine raved and it did not look or stay any longer or better than this one so returned it and went back to this. Love this foundation.

I will be getting more of the products. * Product was too watery * Okay, I love Nars.  Have combination skin. Was able to find the perfect shade.  The finish dried a little to flat and matte.  It would be ideal to wear if you need the make up to last.  This would be a great  back up makeup not an every day.  If you have oily skin...maybe your everyday. * This foundation is 100% worth the price. Its buildable coverage so you can decide how you want it to look. It covers acne but is somehow so thin and light. I use Mont Blanc becuase I'm so pale but it matches perfectly and doesn't oxydize. I recommend this to everyone buy it now!! * Highlights: looks natural on skin and blends well with other products. Has a slight dewy finish and feels lightweight and works well with my dry skin.

Not my faves: It doesn't cover my rosacea super well on its own but it is buildable. also it has a slight yellow hue to it on my skin."

You get the no-makeup makeup look effortlessly. I don't use a brush or sponge to apply, just my fingers, and a dime size covers my face. I got lucky; I stocked up before y'all sold it out! Yet, I'm glad you all found something that fits well! * Great color and application however through out the day starts to leave my skin a little greasy. * I've bought this twice now , trying to get it to work for me. I've used it with primer, no primer, fingers, sponge, brush. Its always peels and looks terrible. I'm pretty knowlegable when it comes to makeup and I've used alot of different foundations. I love Chanel and love some of their other foundation, but not this one. * I've been wearing this for 4 years and will never buy another.  It goes on light and easy, adds a nice luminous glow to my skin and provides even and light coverage. * Thank goodness ULTA Carrie's this now!! The ONLY foundation that does NOT settle in your fine lines and I have mega lines still doesn't settle, I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION, please chanel never discontinue this! * I love how my skin feels with this Chanel foundation it looks and feels so smooth.

I have acne scars very large pores deep smile lines that collect the makeup.... And I'm 53. All the nightmares!!!!  This foundation!!!  I mean common!!!  It covered everything!  It blurred the pores on my nose, which nothing ever has, it didn't settle it those deep lines, even the ones in the corner of my mouth!!!  I looked Dewey all day!  I felt like I was wearing nothing. It wasn't even the right shade cause they were out but I just used a bit of bronzer and omg perfection!!  I will never ever use anything else.

It matches my skin well, the coverage is settle which I prefer and can layer. Overall I like it so far and will continue using! * This tinted moisturizer is very lightweight and easily blended. It doesn't have a lot of coverage but I think that's kind of the point. It works well for what it is. I like that it has spf in it but I do I wish there was a little higher spf coverage in it. I received this for free to review. * After several years of using this product, I can offically write a review. I serioulsy love this. I ALWAYS find my self coming back to this when I try other complextion products. The application, the coverage, the finish, and the longevity is what draws me back. It says its a tinted moistureizer, but I get Light to Medium coverage. Which I LOVE. One tube also last me a long time, which is a bonus! Seriously.. I hope this product never goes away.. * I have tried so many tints.  Some were sticky, some were cakey but this was one was perfect.  Just the right amount of coverage which was light to medium but buildable.  And it had the perfect color for my complexion. * Feel like you have no make up on. This foundation goes on so smooth. * Packaging and scent was nice but the product left an orange tint on my face. It was good coverage and it felt nice on my skin, just not for me. Probably best for tanner people * I find this product is too thick. Its too hard to spread and even takes a bit of effort to squeeze it out of the tube. I want my makeup to be speedy and I find myself not enjoying using it because of this. I also think for a tinted moisturizer, it should be thinner."

This has a great real skin finish and you only need a little. My normal hormonal breakouts are not hanging around as long as previous and thats thanks to the niacinamid and willowbark.
I get so many compliments on this! * By far the best I tried * This serum foundation is absoluteoy beautiful. I bought it on a whim at regukar price. I am so happy to have a back up on sale price! I am 42 with dry to normal skin type. The coverage is medium but buildable. The texture is so silky, comparable to an $87 designer foundation. I am conpletely blown away by this foundation! You will not regret trying it out! * I received this as a Diamond gift, and I'm relieved I didn't spend money on it. It felt like I was applying pure oil to my face, leaving me looking greasy. By the end of the day, I even noticed a blemish. Definitely a pass for me. * I am a very oily person however I always powder and set and can at least last for about 3-4 hours before I have to blot. This felt heavy on the skin immediately and I could feel the grease within an hour. Not oily but GREASY within the hour. Couldnt wait to wash my face off. Their loose powder however is very blurring and oil controling love that stuff * I've been on the hunt for a new foundation, and finally found it! I wanted a longwearing foundation that would last 12 hours or more. To simplify this, its non cakey, doesn't separate, and looks flawless on the skin * This foundation belongs in the trash.

SPF 20 is basically pointless. Once I finish the bottle, I will not purchase again. * It pilled on my skin n looked blotchy. Guess it wasn't good over my skin prep. I use Depology products to prep. * I love the look and feel of this foundation. It provides more of a natural glow than anything I've tried before. It stays on all day without feeling heavy and works with my sensitive skin. * I love this product so much! It goes on smoothly and looks so natural. It doesn't look cakey and has great coverage!

Horrible horrible product. * Very light weight, buildable, and looks beautiful on skin! * I was so excited for this product just for it to be patchy, dry my face out and made me look 10x older. Not a fan :( * I really don't like the color choices. I tried two different shades but none of them suited my skin tone. I have warm undertone. Mostly yellow or tan color works best. If you like sheer coverage then it's best for you. I like medium coverage which it supposed to be but not even covers anything. * I usually buy the more high end foundations but figured let me give this a try since I like their other products. And I'm so glad I did! It's usually very hard for me to match my exact skin tone and this was perfect! Will definitely be buying more. * beautiful foundation, unfortunately the worst packaging of all time. completely exploded in my makeup bag. had to clean everything. i had to duct tape the lid to the bottle and placed it in a plastic bag. it still leaks. cant use the foundation if theres no foundation to use. ive only used it twice and theres not even half the bottle left. throwing money away, literally."

It is meant to be sheerer than the original Double Wear, and shouldn't be compared to that. This is a little more than a skin tint that doesn't leave your face feeling sticky. It dries down nicely, feels weightless and is perfect if you don't want full coverage. I hope this formula is never discontinued! * This is definitely one of my favorite foundations I've ever used. I'm still bummed they took it out of stores. * I love the texture of this product. It's very serumy and truly lovely on the skin. I have dry skin and it looks so nice and glowy yet never greasy. It's good for day to day. I love the color too. I have light medium olive skin and the coverage is enough to where it blends just fine. Not a holy grail, but a consistent go-to. * This 👏 product 👏 is 👏 incredible 👏!! It makes my skin look like skin, just perfected!! It does not look like I have makeup on! It evens out my skintone and adds the perfect amount of coverage for every day, especially during hot summer days. I bought this because I was on the hunt for something that would be lighter and not melt off my face in a gross cakey way in the heat, and this is it!! I wish I tried it sooner!! * As a very oily girl, i hate to say but i am disappointed. The doible wear is great for oily skin but i needed something light coverage and matte at the same time. I needed something to wear to work everyday. Unfortunately, my oily skin pertruded after a two hours snd i had to pat down my skin. So i recommend if you have you combo skin but for oily skin not necessarily. * I'm on the fence. Love the finish very natural. Doesn't settle in lines and wrinkles. Very runny and thin seems to take a lot of product to produce a full face coverage.  My 70yo skin on nose is breaking out a bit and this is only new product I am using so I'm just not sure  will keep trying * I really enjoy using this foundation. It is so lightweight, a perfect color match, and wears nicely throughout the day. It doesnt get overly oily/shiny in my T-zone where I experience that the most. Minimal setting into my fine lines and wrinkles - even less when I prep with a primer. 

I highly recommend!"

 Would not recommend to anyone. * Perfect buildable foundation for mature, dry skin. Leaves a slightly dewy finish. Beautiful! * In the store it looked good on my skin. When I put on a full application it was very heavy and did not sit well on the rest of my skin. * I am not sensitive to smells usually but this one straight up smells like fish oil, like the kind you would take as a supplement.  Can't stand the smell so can't use it. * Love Love!  Blends smoothly & does not settle in creases. Hydrates mature skin. Contains spf to protect your skin all day. The color match for me was absolutely perfect!! Highly recommend this product! * I didn't like it at all. I got the shade matched in the store. It seemed fine, but after one sunny day -while wearing sunscreen and a hat - I got minimally tanned and the shade made me look pale. Considering that this product has SPF 45 it was quite surprising that I tanned. Additionally, this foundation wasn't hydrating at all no matter which moisturizer I used underneath the foundation. My skin felt very dry. I will return the product."

I am 59 and finding a foundation that covers and not look gross is really hard.  SO yes, finding one even at this price that does, is worth it to me   I save up my points and use that to offset the price as needed * Hey girl, we gotta talk. Why would you do this to us??? This formula is flawless, I cant even feel it on. It is GORGEOUS. How am I supposed to continue to buy this? It is way out of my budget but I splurged for my birhday and now im trying to figure out how to sell my soul to the Chanel gods because i have to use this every day and I will run out! You knocked it out of the park with this one and now all I can think about is what other amazing Chanel products am I missing out on by having the wrong number in my bank account?!!! This is perfection and I just had to say it. * Finally found a cool toned foundation that doesn't oxidize and turn orange! I love everything about this foundation and it has become my go to. Lightweight so you don't need to use a lot, buildable coverage, liquid or powder blush goes on over it well. All around recommend and will keep buying it! * I get compliments on my skin EVERYTIME i wear this. Its second to none. So underrated. I have combination and sensitive skin. * This is a nice foundation but I don't find this foundation particularly luminous. To me it's almost a soft matte. I have to add oil to it to achieve any luminosity. coverage is a solid medium and I would consider it buildable. I don't find it great for dry mature skin.  It can look a little cakey if not applied in thin layers. I will finish it but won't repurchase. For my skin type I much prefer the Healthy Glow foundation as an all purpose foundation. This foundation is more full glam for me. * This is my new favorite foundation. I can apply it with my hands, brush, sponge and it always looks so beautiful and natural. The color match is perfect and it lasts throughout my entire 8 hour work day and beyond. I cannot recommend this enough. I also do have oily/combo skin."
94,smashbox,always on skin-balancing foundation with hyaluronic acid + adaptogens,pimprod2040206,2610447," * I was honestly not going to buy this based on the reviews, but I did anyway because this has a fair olive shade which is difficult to find. this foundation is a great match for a pale neutral-warm olive, and it feels like im not wearing makeup (sensory friendly). 

I am allergic to a lot of makeup but not this. it did not cause my acne prone skin to break out. * Let me tell you I have tried a  million foundations and this one leaves your skin glowing ! No oxidizing not too oily but not to too drying 
Please DONT discontinue !! * I did my own wedding makeup and this foundation looked amazing all night. I was so happy with it! 10/10 * I loved this product! The bottle, the color match, the way it sets but i have combi skin and it broke apart and got shiny * I bought 2 shades . Im in my 40's with combo skin.  I got L10N and L20. Heres my opinion: Its a bit yellow toned to me. Go in person to buy it. It gets darker as it oxidizes, so the lighter ended up the best shade.You have to apply it quickly as it drys down fast, it looks a bit masky upon first applying, but melts into the skin within a few minutes and looks really good for the most part. It does not settle into fine lines or wrinkles. But it transfers really bad onto everything and starts looking worn off and patchy on dry spots as the day goes on. It just wasn't good for me for the price. I would not buy again or recommend. * I'm very oily, in my mid-40s, and still get the occasional breakout. I've had trouble with my  foundation faves now caking (prestige brands). I found this one and it is my new go to. I bought the Smashbox oil control primer along with the foundation. It wears all day without caking. It covers just right. You don't have to use a setting powder, but it works good with one if that's preferred. Mid-day I have minimal shine and can go without fixing it. Game changer! * I've been trying to find the right combination of moisturizer + sunscreen + this foundation + setting spray to keep my skin looking as skin-like as possible. This foundation is not as easy as others to create that effect, unfortunately. I usually end up looking a bit dry and my skin looks made-up, not natural. Doesn't seem to matter what combination of light layers and dewy setting spray I use, I can see the foundation and it settles in my pores. Not a great look. I'll be sticking with Easy Blur and my Ciele skin tint instead since those always go on flawlessly and look natural."
95,maybelline,super stay 24h skin tint + vitamin c,pimprod2039657,2610817," * It looked pretty in the skin, but after wearing it for 2 days my skin barrier was horrible.  This made my skin dry and flaky, and I used moisturizer underneath it too. * Beautiful skin tint. Has good coverage and it is easy to blend. I have oily skin, and this product does not make me look greasy at all. It also has a long-lasting effect. * I wanted to love this tint but I'm having a hard time. I got shade 118 initially, and it looked great going on the skin but then I checked the mirror in couple hours, I looked orange. I thought okay, maybe I need lighter shade. Purchased lighter shade, same thing, looked great once applied but turned orange in 2-3 hours. This is a great product in terms of texture and how nicely it blurs imperfections but Maybelline needs to improve the formula so tint doesn't oxidizes so quickly. * Colour wasn't a great match but do-able. In certain areas of my face it looked great and coverage was ideal…my skin but a little better. However it clung to drier areas even with moisturizer and primer, looking patchy. Dropper was also annoying, gunked up the top of the bottle, ended up tossing it. * Let me start off by saying that for YEARS I've used either the It Cosmetics CC Cream (this is actually heavy), Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation (heavy but not as thick as the It CC Cream) and Clinique Even Better Makeup SPF 15. I have also tried the Lancome Foundation in the past and Nars. This skin tint is the BEST ""foundation"" I've ever used. It blends seamlessly into the skin and creates the most natural finish. When you think of skin tint, you think of light coverage BUT dont let this fool you. It is SO lightweight but impeccable coverage. It truly is versatile. If you love a dewy look, then set lightly with powder. If you love a matte look, use a mattify primer and set with your fav setting powder. 

For reference, I have combination skin. I get very dry around my chin which is where I have the most problems with my makeup (gets patchy and clings onto dry spots). I have never had a flawless makeup application. It looks good for one hour then afterwards it starts to do that weird separation. So I figured it was time for something lighter. This stuff is my holy grail and I'm so happy it was recommended to me by my friends. I look more youthful and it gives such a gorgeous glow after 10 hours! I do get oily in the t-zone but the oil breaks through as a slight glow not aome oily slick mess. * I cannot rave enough about how much I love this skin tint! I have SUPER acne prone & oily skin but this product does not break me out. Even after wearing it 12+ hours! LOVE LOVE LOVE it is super lightweight and feels hydrating 😍 * I cannot rave enough about how much I love this skin tint! I have SUPER acne prone & oily skin but this product does not break me out.

96,l'orÃ©al,true match super-blendable foundation,pimprod2034733,2602421," * But watch out, because it oxidizes very badly too. * This is a good makeup for drier skin. Coverage is medium to light, not a heavier concealer type foundation.   I just wish they hadn't cut product size into half of what it used to be.  (like every manufacturer). * love the shade range and it looked promising right after i put it on, but it hasn't been a full day yet and it's already creasing, showing every pore, and highlighting dry patches/flakes i didn't even know i had (i'm oily/combo). it also oxidized a little bit, it's noticeably yellower now than it was a few hours ago. maybe it just doesn't agree with my skin prep (i always use the milk hydro grip primer), but i don't want to reinvent my usual routine for this one foundation. i'll have to pass on it :( * I initially liked this foundation but found that it looked caulky abd patchy on my skin, particularly around fine lines and drier parts of my face. Its a pass for me and I threw out the remaining priduct. * I wear tinted sunscreen but felt I needed something more when I wear a full face of makeup. This has great coverage, not tacky, good color match and long wearing. Great price point since I don't wear it every day. * I think it just depends in what typ on skin you have. * This is my nee favkrite foundation. I stopped wearing makeup because foundation always felt too heavy and settled on my face. This did not. Makeup looked great all night."
97,estÃ©e lauder,double wear stay in place matte powder foundation refill,pimprod2031253,2593713," * I love this foundation. I first tried the stay wear liquid but I found that I like the stay wear powder foundation better. I have combination skin with hormonal acne and it doesn't aggravate my acne at all. I usually just get a under the skin bump or two on my chin a week before my cycle and this foundation doesn't make it worse or aggravate it in any way. I don't have any injections or fillers and I have some fine lines and it doesn't sit in those lines making me look older so I definitely like that. I take good care of my skin and  believe in aging gracefully. I know I am getting older and the wrinkles are coming but thats okay with me. My smile lines are from the wonderful smiles and laughs I've had and I wear them proudly. I eat a healthy diet, workout every morning and I only drink water and my skin reflects that and looks healthy. Just because we age doesn't mean we won't look good anymore. Healthy, glowing skin is beautiful at any age in my opinion. So, I use this powder foundation all year round and I definitely recommend using a good primer for your skin type before applying this foundation. It definitely keeps it looks good thru your work day. I use to solely use Clinique and I still use their eye shadow, mascara, blush and skincare but I had a good friend introduce me to this foundation and I literally ran out to get it lol. Just remember every day you wake up is a gift and a chance to shine :) * Once I apply Esstee's  Double wear foundation I use her compact powder to set the foundation.  It is a perfect complement to the foundation. * Love products * I wear 1c1 in winter but 2c1 in summer,I love how easy it is to change out shades with these refills. It's a wonderful, flexible formula that's never cakey. * I buy ivorynude (one if the lightest shades).The color mathecs perfects, at first. However, with a couple hours, my makeup looks a couple shades darker. I have worn this on my tropical vacations and it holds against water, still looking perfect. If you buy a couple shades lighter, it may work for you. * Love the smooth look 👌 * I am 47 with normal to dry skin. Full coverage long lasting!"
98,dior,forever natural nude foundation,pimprod2036826,2604394," * This foundation is amazing..it's as if the Forever Matte and Glow had a baby.  It gives such a beautiful satin finish that is not too matte and not too glowy just perfect. I will definitely buy this again and I've recommended it to quite a few of my friends and they love it as well! * I have been trying to decide why I am not reaching for this foundation and I have come to the conclusion I may have gotten an old bottle. The texture is thick and gel like; not what I would expect from a ""nude natural"" foundation. Looks cakey. and when I shake it I don't hear or feel any movement in the bottle. It doesn't really smell spoiled although it does have a fragrance as Dior does. I have tried thinning it out with oil or moisturizer but then it doesn't dry down as it should. I am disappointed but don't know if it's actually the product or that I received  an old bottle. Unfortunately I tossed the box. It's not impossible as I have received  expired products from the warehouse on a couple of other occasions. But I have definitely had better foundations that cost less. * I was not wowed by this foundation. maybe my color match wasn't the best. I am fair to light with a neutral leaning slightly warm complexion and I don't think there is a great match for me in this product. I did not find this product to look very natural or give me any sort of radiance. I felt it looked semi matte rather than a natural finish. Coverage was fine-light to medium as expected. I much prefer Chanel's Healthy Glow foundation. I have mature skin and think perhaps this foundation is better suited to a younger customer. I didn't dislike it but I would not repurchase it. For me it looked rather flat no matter how I prepped my skin. * This is a fantastic foundation! It's lightweight and  leaves me looking naturally flawless. I will say it doesn't completely cover dark spots/acne but I am personally fine with that- nothing a little concealer can't help with. I will definitely be repurchasing. * Wonderful product! * This is the best foundation that I have tried in at least the last 5 years of searching for ""the one"".  Not too heavy or too light. Not cakey and does not settle into my fine lines. This foundation lasts throughout the workday and well into the evening. Definitely worth the price. Finally!  I've found the one!! * Here's a quick review you can use for Dior foundation at Ulta:

""I absolutely love how smooth the Dior foundation applies to my skin! It blends effortlessly, giving me a flawless finish that feels lightweight yet provides great coverage. The formula feels luxurious, and it lasts all day without creasing or feeling heavy. Whether you're going for a natural look or building it up for full glam, this foundation is a game-changer. Highly recommend trying it out—you won't be disappointed!"""
99,mac,studio radiance serum powered foundation,pimprod2040797,2613967," * I enjoyed the Dewey coverage. It was a medium coverage foundation. I think you could build it. I love the moisture; it looked pretty. But of course within three days it gave me acne. I love what olive oil does to the strength of my skin, but for some reason, it does clog my pores. * at 1st I wasn't sure but compared to many after this i realized this blends easy w sponge and morphs into skin like silk * Dry looking. Sticks to dry patches. Not radiant. Looks flat. Color match was off-used color theory to adjust. * Excellent foundation! * Loved the feel of the foundation but shade was too light and too orange. * So easy to apply * I was told it was like the urban decay lock it foundation and it didn't cover much of anything"
100,maybelline,super stay up to 24hr hybrid powder-foundation,pimprod2036593,2603936," * This product contains silica which can damage DNA and the nano particles can help your skin asorb the harmful ingredients of the other trash makeup you're buying! * The best powder foundation ive found and ive tried many. Here's a list of ones ive tried and i still like this better than: Make Up For Ever blurring powder foundation, Bareminerals original loose powder mineral foundation, Jane Iredale loose powder foundation, Jane Iredale pressed powder foundation, Tarte Amazonian Clay loose powder foundation. So yeah — ive tried A LOT. Everytime i come back to this one, i question why i keep trying to find something better. Make sure to first prep your skin with a good moisturizer and primer before applying. Let both fully absorb and dry before applying a powder foundation. This is simply the best ive found and each time i wear it, i get told how good my skin looks and even most recently, how i look like im still in my 20s lol. Im way past 20s. * I purchased the Maybelline Super Stay Up To 24 Hour Hyrbid Powder Foundation in shade 118 as an alternative to a luxury brand I typically use. This powder foundation not only covers better than the luxury brand, it looks and performs better, for a third of the price! The shade is also a perfect match for my fair but olive skintone, not to pink or yellow, just right. I am 37 with dry skin and this still works for me. It does not settle into fine lines, crease, cake up, or become shiny throughout the day. I wear it to work every day and am considering it as my wedding foundation for later this year! I apply it with a brush when I want less coverage and with the accompanying sponge when I want more coverage. It lasts all day and does not transfer. I typically use a setting spray afterwards but even when I forget it still lasts and looks good. I just cant say enough good things about this product! * definitely minimal coverage but works great for a no makeup-makeup day. * This was my go to daily wear foundation. Great colors and nice light coverage. However, almost immediately cracks form in the pan and big chunks fall out of the compact and the little dust particles that are left are pretty much rendered useless. It's unfortunate because the product could be very good. * First off, Shade 112 is absolute perfection for me. This has such incredible coverage that only a small amount is required to help make your skin look so pretty! It can be built up to absolute full coverage but, in my opinion, that can look a bit cakey and too artificial. I use a flat top brush to apply this mostly to my nose and cheeks where I've got the most redness then pull it outward and I'm never not satisfied with the coverage. I've gotten a darker shade to wear as bronzer just because it covers so well! * Nice texture and goes on easy. Wish I had bought a slightly darker shade."

102,tarte,amazonian clay blurring powder foundation,pimprod2036934,2604704," * There are very few options for powder for the minimal make up gen xer that I am. Sometimes I just want to cover some of the shine, so hopelessly out of fashion of me I know but real life skin has things that I want to cover and foundation powder had been my friend for many years. Out of the slim pickings this was my choice. Immediate negative was that the pan was loose from the compact and I had to find my glue dots to fix. The coverage is fine and I like the more minimal compact but I don't think it would survive in a purse. Which is the clutch point as to why i love powder compacts, you can put them in your bag and they survive. Absolutely loved playing with my grandma's compact and wish that beautiful compacts would come back because we need something easy and elegant in this world. * The pressed powder is very fine and delicate, creating a natural makeup finish that looks like naturally flawless skin. It doesn't control oil or provide coverage, but I don't think that's a big issue because it's already incredibly convenient. * Normally I use with my pore smooth as a primer for work then my setting spray. Sometimes I will use a tinted moisturizer or milk flex stick under. Mainly in the winter. As a combo/oily kinda gal, it lasts through work in the restaurant industry and sweating during the summer. I have my summer medium shade and my winter light shade. I am about to be 49 and starting to get fine smile lines around my eyes and mouth. It doesn't settle like others I tried which is important to me. My go to must have can't be without. Ask my hubby 😁 * I was informed by a women at ulta that the powder concealer from tarte that I used was discontinued and that this was it's replacement. I mentioned to her I had sensitive skin and was told there would be no issue as it was a minor ingredient change. this was in fact not the case. I wasted my money on this product as I am not fully covered in hives and welts to the extend I had to take a benadryl. if you have sensitive skin please use with caution. this product differs greatly from their previous one. * I use the liquid Amazon Clay foundation for years. First time trying the powder. This is nice, light weight. Definitely an everyday wear. Leaves skin, soft and does not feel heavy or caky. * Creat coverage * Fine powder"
103,pat mcgrath labs,skin fetish: sublime perfection foundation,pimprod2040434,2613894," * This is such a beautiful foundation. It give enough to cover redness and uneven tones but still looks natural and not heavy. You dont even know you have anything on. Beautiful for mature skin. * Since my diet is vegan it is important to know that my favorite foundation is vegan as well. I get THE MOST compliments on my skin when im wearing this foundation. It is extremely lightweight and goes on like a dream. Perfect amount of coverage and never streaks or cracks. Amazing quality worth the investment. Nothing else beats this! * I was not sure about this after seeing complaints about stinging, tightness, and so on. I use a high strength retinol in the winter so skin tends to be sensitive and dry now (Jan.) I was pleasantly surprised that this serum felt great for me. Obviously, lots of people are sensitive to this, but I was lucky. It actually feels hydrating.

It is easy to blend but the ""runny"" reviews are 100% correct. I build in a number of passes or just use a good concealer + a couple of pumps.

Now, the color choices. Even for a lighter coverage foundation, Ulta's availability of shades was inadequate. I got a ""yellow neutral"" shade because there were no pink or just neutrals in my depth in stock. It works ok since I usually do not build coverage, but I don't understand why they added neutral to descriptions. It is a straight-up warm foundation, although it is not as intensely yellow as some other brands. 

I am not sorry I purchased and wear this every day. Not sure I would recommend at this price point for most people for the trickiness of application, difficulty matching, and risk of sensitivity. I would probably repurchase but only with full shade range like other brands with 40+ (not sure if we can name?) * if I could marry a makeup product I would marry this one. I hate the feeling of foundation on my face and this one looks like skin and feels like skincare. I have put my sisters, my mother, my friends all on this product and everyone is amazed. * I was looking for a new foundation. I get full coverage without the dryness and cracking that other products caused. This product produces a flawless look. * This foundation has many positive attributes. It has a lovely natural finish and a great shade range. It feels like a serum and blends beautifully. I so wanted to love this because the shade was perfect which is unusual for me. Unfortunately, it felt terrible on my face. Granted, I have dry, mature skin but I'm not particularly sensitive. I could not get past the tight feeling from the alcohol in this. It made my skin sting, feel tight and look dry as the day wore on. I felt it wore very well but it also caused some redness for me. I tried several moisturizers, oils and primers and nothing helped. so it's definitely a NO for me. It felt like a strange polymer on my face. However, for anyone not sensitive to a high alcohol content I would still recommend it. It truly is a beautiful foundation and if it was reformulated without so much alcohol I would try it again. * Goes on like a serum, covers like a light weight powder. I received so many compliments. I will purchase again."

She broke apart, leaving a weird finish on skin. It still looked ok from afar but the moment you got close it was a disaster. I tried and tried again. I thought maybe it's my sunscreen, my serum, my moisturizer. But no matter what I switched out, the same thing happened - goes on great and breaks apart in an hour or two. I returned her :( * I have oily/combo acne prone skin. This product is great on my oily sections and provides a full coverage. It has an insane amount of product, I have used a lot of it and ive had it for over a year yet still have half. It can cling to my pimples a little bit but as i wear it through the day it blends into it. * I have used Hourglass (which I prefer) as well as IT Cosmetics and both have changed the description for their products (from a name to a number and vice versa). I have a number on my Hourglass stick and unfortunately can't reorder online. So frustrating!
IT doesn't even have the description on the product so that sealed the deal for them. Makes no sense why they make it so hard for the consumer. * Good color match and formula. Problem packaging, amount of product, and price. The product was stuck to the cap. I was able to get the product out and place it in a tiny jar. Packaging needs redesign for the price. Can't recommend for this reason. * No matter which technique I try, the outcome is always the same: it cracks, transfers, and looks terrible after just half an hour. It exacerbates my acne, making me feel like I've wasted my money 😞 * I was really excited to try this foundation as I have heard a makeup artist I watch on youtube obsess over it for years. I tried this foundation two times and returned it after the second try. Both times I wore it, it gave the same poor results. This foundation does provide full coverage which was exciting to me, but the longer I wore it, the worst it looked. I could almost tell after a few minutes of having it on, it was alresdy breaking down on my skin. Very disappointed. I wish it would have worked. * I was really excited to try this foundation as I have heard a makeup artist I watch on youtube obsess over it for years.

I have my go to full coverage foundation but wanted something a bit lighter to wear on casual days with spf. I was hesitant about the radiant natural finish because I have oily skin but after wearing trying the shade 'More' i think ive found a new go to skin tint! It wears beautifully (and even helped a little with some dry patches im
experiencing from a breakout) and the color matches me perfectly! I would say its more of a natural finish (radiant makes me think dewy/glowy which is beautiful but not for my skin). Thank you Serena for this product, its a win! * I wore this at a fancy brunch event. The ladies kept talking about how flawless my skin looked, lol! It didn't rub off on my friends when i hugged them. It also maybe that i ised primer before & after.. but i love this glow! Natural * I think this is the first skin tint I've used that is a true neutral! It's a 'wyn' for sure. You do have to work quick because the formula dries fast. The color match was a bit lighter but that's not an issue with the product, but Ulta's website. * I was hoping tontey out a more lightweight formula but this isnt it for me. The smell is nice bur once on my skin its very blotchy looking. When working it in it just feels greasy. Not great if you have acne prone skin. Cute packaging * I absolutely love this. It goes in light and then oxidizes. It matches my skin shade perfecly and gives good coverage but is buildable. * Serena did her big one with this! This is my favorite skin tint. I got so many compliments on my skin while wearing it. I even put my sister on. I am buying it again.

Now, it did pill for me once but I think it doesn't go well with the Elf primer/setting spray. I don't have the pilling problem when I use Urban Decay All Nighter Glow primer/setting spray. 

Also it does oxidize cause it's a skin tint so be mindful when buying online. I was told I needed 450 ABOVE but 360 NEXT was my perfect match. * I love this skin tint! I am a true neutral and shade 150 matches my light neutral skin tone. I don't like heavy coverage and this is very lightweight"

I like that it doesn't dry out my skin and it gives me a nice glow. This was gifted by hourglass cosmetics. * This foundation is amazing! It is not heavy and has good coverage. I wear a mask at work and do not break out with this foundation and I have with other types of foundation. I would highly recommended this foundation! * I'm 50+ with combo oily but dehydrated skin and I love this foundation. The shade match is decent considering they don't have the olive undertone my skin needs. The coverage is great but it does eventually sink in my smile lines throughout the day, which 99% of foundations do to me. I just use less in that area and pat a cotton swab along my smile lines, problem alleviated. * I have tried many foundations over the years, this and estee doublr wear will always be my top foundations. The coverage is amazing, it blurs my texture and pores, lasts all day, doesnt seperate or enhance dryness. I have very very dry skin with bad roscea and other skin issues and it looks beautiful even on my bad skin days and causes me no irritation. Plus shade 3 is perfect for me. * I wanted something creamy/dewy to provide a little moisture to my skin. I thought this product would be what I was looking for, but it wasn't. Totally bummed! * It is a nice formula that looks beautiful on acne textured skin. 
Not sure what it is in this formula that is breaking me out, but everytime i wear this after washing it off there is always new pimples. Took me awhile to realize this. * Im 53 looking for a semi matte foundation. I was hoping this was it . It goes on beautifully , but after an hour it separates on my forehead , disappears on my nose and makes me shine not in a good way. All this even with the hourglass primer ."

My daughter found this for me and so far i absolutely love it. The color match is perfect.  It goes on so soft and smooth and there is not a weird or strong smell. * Good coverage. * The first time gave me a rash so I waited a couple of months to make sure it was this and I tried it again and gave a red bumps all over my face. I'm not the only one. There's a lot of bad reviews w the same effect. * Excellent powder foundation for older women.  I don't know why my color doesn't seem to be available anymore though.  What's going on with the limited shade offerings?  Fenty still has all 50 shades on their website! * Ive been using this powder in shade 150 since it came out. All of a sudden theres no lighter shades? Not even one around the color ive been using. I've probably went through 10 of these compacts, and am beyond disappointed. Def gives me the ick for the brand!! * Perfect match for my skin tone. * I did the color match online and they matched me with a Shane that is not even available anymore. At the store I matched with 210 and the consultant said they are not going to carry that shade anymore. why would this supposedly inclusive brand cut all these different shades from their lineup?

The bakuchiol must be helping my skin too! * If you have mature skin and have struggled to find that perfect fit for your foundation needs, look no further. This does not settle in fine lines. It's lightweight, has an amazing finish. It's chef's kiss 💋 * This is a dupe for Chanel water tint. This is so much better than Chanel for half the price! This has a beautiful finish, feels good on my skin and provides light to medium coverage. This is a tint, if you're looking for full coverage, this is not for you! Very pretty, would recommend! * This is so pretty! I apply to fingers and straight to face no brush, no sponge and it distributes quickly! (Definitely very similar to the chanel) Perfect if you need just a tint. Its not overly dewy or greasy feeling at all. I think all skin types can wear this. * I love this foundation. My skin looks glowy, and it improves my hyperpigmentation. * This covergirl essence foundation is the even better version of the Chanel les beiges water fresh complexion touch. I usually use very high end products and this is the longest lasting light coverage foundation I have ever used. I'm a flight attendant and this lasts 12+ hours, does not separate, and looks glowy and amazing. I never use drugstore products and I am so glad I tried this bevause it is my new fav light coverage foundation. 10000/10 reccomend. * This is my favorite ""skin-tint"" esque product I have tried thus far. It's extremely light weight, blends in quite easily, doesn't look weird over textured skin, lasts a good amount of time, and has a natural finish without looking too glowy. I would rate this a 4.5 if I could though, because I really dislike the packaging. The wrapper is really hard to remove and makes you peel of the label in order to be able to access the product, and the bottom of the product is bulbous, so it can barely stand up straight. It's not enough to make me stop using the product though, the formula really is incredible, I just would love the packaging to be updated a bit as it seems extremely cheap, even for a drugstore brand."

It has a beautiful finish on my skin. It pairs well with my primer and moisturizer, which is a plus. I wish it came in a bigger bottle, but the quality of the product makes up for it. * I have combo skin; my T-zone is an oil slick, there are random patches of extremely dry skin, and the rest is normal.

T-zone: foundation separates and looks really bad. No powder or application technique can fix it.

Random dry patches: foundation cakes up, but not terribly. It would be passable by the ""3 feet"" rule.

Normal skin: foundation is BEAUTIFUL, which sucks, because how many people actually have completely normal skin? The negative reviews are so hot + cold because this foundation wasn't formulated for a specific skin type outside of ""normal"".

The overall pros: foundation blends seamlessly and the shade match is excellent. It has a beatiful, dewy-satin finish, and cream products lay really nicely on top of it. I rebought this three times because the majory of my skin was ""normal"" and it looked so nice, I could pretend my T-zone wasnt a disaster lol. It also wore well in the sun and hot environments for a few hours, and never oxidized on me.

The cons: aside from the dry/oily problems, there is something in this foundation that made my face itch like CRAZY. It wasnt until I ran out and bought a drugstore brand on the fly, that I realized it was this foundation. After about 4-6 hours on my face, it would itch unbearably. Additionally, there is no setting powder or technique that could keep this foundation from transferring. If you rub your face at all, sweat, or get liquid on it while wearing it, you're cooked.

This was a book but I hope it was thorough enough to help someone who might be deciding if this foundation would be right for them! * Doesn't look cakey on the skin, goes on really nicely, if you're on the fence about buying it. Buy it you won't regret it * I love this foundation- I've been using it for about 6 months now and ive repurchased it multiple times. I'm an incredibly pale person and this foundation has had the best color match I've ever been able to find and I've tried a wide variety of brands. * Great coverage and having hyaluronic acid is great because it helps to keep my skin look good and it doesn't look cakey on me!!! * Has a decent skin like finish, but it separates super easily no matter what I do for my base I wouldn't repurchase."

I mix 2 colors to achieve my perfect match, and I apply with a brush in a circular fashion. I do not have the problem of it settling into lines.  It is the absolute best for sun protection!  I might cry if it were discontinued. * This is my favorite makeup, not only does it have 50 SPF but it lasts all day while helping my skin!  The price is TERRIFIC I only wish my local Ulta store would carry it!! * I don't mind sunscreen smell much, but this was strong unpleasant sunscreen smell, almost to bug spray smell level. Hard nope. Seemed okay otherwise for a thinner more skincare oriented foundation. * I used the Ulta website to find the shade I needed but it was too yellow. * Love! If this was $40 i would pay $40 for it! Super lightweight and hydrating BUT not greasy. I found the perfect shade for me and im on my 3rd bottle! * Im 31, starting to get fine lines. What used to work for me, now settles in lines. This works amazingly and doesnt settle. It gives a beautiful glow, and lasts long. I dont use a primer, I just use my vanicream moisturizer and it works amazingly! Love this!

The coverage is way better than the other water fresh foundation which had none at all, and its leaves the most beautiful, natural finish. My only complaint is that the bottle goes much quicker than other foundations but its so good that I'm going to buy it anyway. * Shocked at how bad it is for the price and being Chanel. Consistency and coverage sucks, smells weird, doesnt blend, brush is crap. Just all around bad. * This is probably the best every day product ive ever used. It makes me feel like ME. The consistency is super lightweight.

I absolutely love this stuff! * I have good skin and this product was recommended by an Ulta associate, so I tried it. I wish I had returned it, but I tried to make it work. It made my skin look pasty and oily like I was sick.  I tried mixing it with other foundations, because I really wanted to love it. It's Chanel! Still, it just ruined everything I tried it with. I tried it as a highlight, and it was ok for that, but not good. I put it in my purse as an emergency foundation, but in the GA heat, the beads melted together. Overall, it was just a mess for me.

The problem is that it's very viscous so you don't need to use too much bc it can look cakey almost instantly. It's also disappointing to see they've shrunk the package to a not even full tiny container and kept the price the same. I think I'll pass on this from now on. * I have combination skin with dry spots by my mouth and oily spots by my t-zone. While it applied fine, after a few hours I could see it starting to separate. If you have normal skin are trying to cover dark spots I would give this a try as it's full coverage but if you have any kind of texture stay away. It sinks into creases and makes acne look worse than a bare face. * After reading reviews about the shades oxidizing, i decided to pair this with LA girls blue color corrector, because i have a light olive skin tone. It doesn't oxidize and lasts me all day! * this foundation is full coverage in is a good price * I will start off by saying that the coverage is good and the finish is beautiful. My issue is I am a very light, pale skinned, freckled, red headed woman. I tried every light shade Juvia offers. They are ALL very yellow/orange based. Even the shades that claim to be peachy or pink. They are ALL yellow/orange. So, unfortunately I am unable to use any of their foundations until they add more cool shades. * It's the best foundation I've ever found to match my skin tone very flawless lightweight I recommend this product to anyone"

I like a multi-tasking products. * I LOVE this foundation. Perfect Match. I heard it was discontinued and was so bummed. But it isn't!!! Thank goodness!! Here it is. I have an extremely hard time finding a match for my pale skin. Thank you soooo much! Buyer for life.. * Great makeup either an older people like me and they're 60s covers blemishes and age spots pretty well * Honestly it's pretty great! Color matched perfect and the application feels more like foundation w/ light coverage. I apply it with a beauty blender, finish with Elf hi-Def setting powder and I'm out the door! Try it for yourself :) * For a long time, instead of using foundation I used either Shape Tape or Born This Way where I need it most and would just blend it out onto my moisturizer.  This summer I developed some really bad sunspots and no matter how much corrector/concealer I'd use, my skin would look grey where the sun spots were.  One day, I tried this because I had gotten a sample and omg it has saved me!  I finally felt comfortable going out again without thinking everyone was staring at me.  The weird part was, it wasn't as heavy or full coverage as my concealer but worked 100x better.  Well, I'm finally at the end of that little tube and also, I now need a lighter color, so here I am.  

This CC cream is better than any other I've tried, it somehow has great coverage but looks incredibly soft and natural.  I'm also able to use it where I need it without seeing lines of demarcation.  This is most definitely an unsung hero and I'm baffled as to how it doesn't have a better rating. * I came in today looking for the tarte BB cream, but saw the cloud CC cream and went with it instead.  It matched well, covered great & has a light feel.  However, I got home and went on the tarte website only to discover it's already been discontinued.  😩 WHY?!? * I love Tarte.

118,exa,high fidelity foundation,pimprod2019009,2573283," * ECSTATIC IN AN UNDERSTATMENT!!! I have been searching for a foundation like this for YEARSSS. (I have super sensitive combo skin leaning dry. Liquid foundations always look terrible on me after 1 hour. I do great skin prep too!) Lightweight, breathable foundation, quality ingredients, minimal ingredients, fragrance free, light to medium coverage, skin like finish, 6 to 8 hour wear still looking flawless, doesnt dry my skin out, doesnt irritate my skin, doesnt cling to dry patches, COLOR MATCH ON POINT, skincare ingredients, AFFORADABLE, anti-pollution (I live in SLC, worst air quality/pollution here) I  literally cried when i first put this foundation on i was so blown away at how perfect it was. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NEVER EVER discontinue or reformulate. I am a customer for life and this foundation has changed my life. * very skin like finish! no fuss foundation. * This is an undetectable foundation on my mature, dry skin, though it can build easily for extra coverage. I will just add additional drops on those darker spots, which still peek through but look more homogenous. But coverage is not my main concern, so this winner maintains the slightly dewy glow over a well -prepped skin base, still looking un made-up by the end of the day. Also, goes over mineral sunscreen flawlessly. IMO it is on par with Haus Labs, Nars Radiant LIght, MUF reboot; my other favs. I am trying another shade, though am happy with Katey, the match I found via the skin models- so that's my recommendation for finding your shade, rather than the description. It is on sale, so... TRY IT! * I'm assuming this foundation is on clearance because of quality issues… I received my order and the formula is completely separated and cannot be mixed back together to a good consistency. * I was so surprised when i first used it, my skin looked like skin. I like a lightweight natiral finish and this gives me exactly that! It also stays on all day/night, only thing is that it oxidizes a little bit but not wnything drastic. Has been my go-to foundation for over a year already! * good match for hard shade (fair/light olive) and good for sensitive/acne prone/scar/texture skin. decent coverage but feels light and natural. but doesnt really set (makeup smudges on my cat) & taking the top off pulls the entire pump out sometimes * I have used this foundation for a few years and it's never let me down. I fluctuate between a range of their lighter, cool toned shades depending on the time of year. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and this doesn't make me break out. A few things I've learned along the way: 

*A thin base layer will cover most spots and uneven tones. If you need more coverage, then spot treat with a little more foundation.
*It pairs beautifully on top of Nudestix tinted sunscreen.
*Applies well with brushes or sponges, but better with your fingers.
*A stippling, dabbing motion is the best method to apply the thin layers.

I'm 41, and I receive many compliments on my skin when I wear this foundation, and I feel like I look more youthful with this on. I will definitely continue to repurchase!"

Greasy thin liquid. Yuck! Will return asap! * This fills in lines well. Soft and velvety. Good coverage. * The foundations separates really easily. If it sits for more than a day, it will be split and pumps out oily liquid. It looks ok on, but isn't remarkable. I have found even with a light hand and a small amount, it looks kind of heavy. That may be because when it separates, it's really hard to get it to mix again so it either pumps out runny liquid or thick. I don't know if I've ever gotten a pump of what the product should actually feel like. Overall, it's not worth it to try and make it work. * dont reccomend this to ANYONE. * I had a crisis because 100% Pure stopped making my foundation ( 2nd Skin Foundation) that I used for years. ( I know that's A Cadillac problem lol) Luckily I got a sample of this from Ulta. it matches my skin and the amount of cover I want, plus had spf which 100% Pure did not, for around the same price. So now I use this and hope it is never discontinued * This foundation DID NOT disappoint! This foundation provided just the right amount of coverage without feeling heavy or making my face look oily or anything like that. Color matched me perfectly as well! * I prefer a foundation that glides on but this one was sort of difficult to smooth on and looked a bit blotchy."

put it on and was melting off my face after 20 minutes, even with Milk's primer and setting spray. Awful product * Don't waste your time. Bad product, bad company. * Even the lightest shade was too dark for me because it oxidizes and turns orange. Product slides off your skin (and I'm not even oily), looks really bad and cracks around any imperfections or dry spots. It did have pretty good coverage for being a serum, but that doesn't really matter if it cakes and looks gross. Felt gross on my skin too. * I have sensitive, acne, prone skin who's currently going through a purge. I've been looking for a foundation that's able to cover my blemishes for now, but that also doesn't make them worse while they're healing. This is the perfect foundation for just that. This is the only foundation that I found that doesn't have any negative qualities on SkinSort. It is beautifully blurring. It has a semi matte finish, covers light redness and texture. The shade match was perfect And it and it looks velvety with a nice setting powder. I think people in these reviews need to review the product for what it is and not because of the mistake they corrected. * i love the texture and the way this glides across my skin. it doesn't break me out. the shade is a perfect match. unfortunately, even with setting spray, it transfers way too easily and rubs off when i wear masks for my job. if it didn't transfer, it'd be absolutely perfect. * I like the coverage and the feel, but was definitely expecting more of a glowy hydrated finish.

I even use an expensive setting spray and still see transfer. bummed bc I liked everything else about the product. * this is really good it blends really good and i never knew it had a pump cuz i thought u just twist it but u just pop it up but i wish it had more in it and it doesn't really have a lot of coverage ok but it matches my skin so much * I dont usually wear foundation so I dont have much to compare this to, but its pretty nice. it blends very easily, its about sheer-medium coverage, and the coverage lasts throughout the day. its not as glowy as i thought it was though, but it doesnt feel drying. it did pill and roll around my temples and chin though, not sure why. the color is slightly off; i got f2 but i probably shouldve gotten f0.5, because its slightly yellow and dark on me, so i just mix it with my concealer. * when I saw this product i was like wow should I get it and i am lad I did . Its so silky goes on skin like nothing . I am really glad I tried this product . * I absolutely love this foundation! It has a beautifully smooth texture that blends effortlessly, providing a seamless finish. I apply it over my Tarte concealer, and the coverage is just right. As someone who typically gravitates toward medium-to-full coverage foundations, this was my first experience with a lightweight formula—and I was pleasantly surprised! It reminds me of the Fenty Pro Filt'r but blends even more easily. Having tried Tarte, Fenty, Revolution, Too Faced, and various drugstore brands, this foundation stands out as my favorite in terms of how it feels on my skin. It's not cakey, doesn't settle awkwardly, and best of all, it doesn't dry out my combination skin. Highly recommend! * I've been trying to find a foundation for my dry skin and this one is my new fav! It does go on a little light, but is very buildable! I do a layer of this, followed by elf halo glow and it leaves my skin looking flawless! It keeps my skin hydrated and lasts all day. I highly recommend, plus you can't beat the price * LOVE this product its almost a dupe for the NARS light reflecting foundation which i love but the shde range sucks! All their shades run pink.

I think the advisement/examples for the colors are way off. If I hadn't been in store for my purchase my color match would have been wildly incorrect. And I'd use a brush for application and avoid the sponge provided. I honestly might go down a shade for the winter but this will be a great summer color! Would def buy again! * I had high hopes for this powder I use alot of Juvias stuff. I'm Native/Mexican and tan quickly in the summer so I was looking for summer shades as opposed to my winter shades but this stuff turned orange so fast on me it also felt like baby powder.

I would buy over and over again. * I have been wanting to try this foundation for a while,  as I love some of the other Milani products, but one of the drawbacks is it can only be purchased online. I finally ordered it and it's ok. I took a quiz to see which color I should order since I've never ordered it before. Again it's only available online, so I can't go test the shades in the store. I am usually an ivory shade in other brands so I got the 220 creamy natural. When it came in, my first reaction was ""oh no"" my fear of ordering the wrong shade came true as the foundation looked really dark and orange. Since I already had it, I decided to test it anyway knowing full well it would not match, but it sort of did end up matching. The dark orange color was just like a film and it was lighter underneath and it blends really well. It feels really lightweight and breathable. It almost feels like you aren't even wearing make up, which makes sense since I found it to be very light coverage. I was hoping for medium to full coverage, but it just evened my skin out like a BB cream would do. I would still recommend it for the price, but wouldn't compare it to the KVD as that's how it was promoted to me. * I took the shade match quiz, the shade was way too light and when applied looks cakey and clings to dry patches. * I got this foundation in the lightest shade and its still too dark and orange. It cakes extremely bad even with two lifht layers. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone! * The cream-to-powder formula is fantastic! I use it alone (no concealer, highlighter, bronzer, blush) and it works great to cover up my acne scars and even out my complexion. However, I have noticed that it breaks me out really badly. I wish there was a clean formula for this type of product. * Right texture for me * 54 with dry skin. I was concerned about this product bc I normal stick to liquid foundation. I have tried almost every one out there but I was extremely surprised by this foundation! It was easily buildiable with smooth application. I was concerned at 1st the color match was a bit darker (245 warm beige) but after concealer & some pressed powder I had the most beautiful sun-kissed glow! For reference I love Nars in Santa-fe, Clinique  CN 40 cream chamois, Colourpop light 55N. I don't really see any skin type having an issue with this product. It was easy to apply, didn't feel heavy or cakey, never felt oily or dry, just smooth & silky. Highly recommend. No issues using other brand products with this foundation. I saw some saying it moves along or was patchy, follow the directions & build it. This is a cream to powder product so it will apply a bit different.  Will repurchase"

It matches my skin well, the coverage is settle which I prefer and can layer. Overall I like it so far and will continue using! * This tinted moisturizer is very lightweight and easily blended. It doesn't have a lot of coverage but I think that's kind of the point. It works well for what it is. I like that it has spf in it but I do I wish there was a little higher spf coverage in it. I received this for free to review. * After several years of using this product, I can offically write a review. I serioulsy love this. I ALWAYS find my self coming back to this when I try other complextion products. The application, the coverage, the finish, and the longevity is what draws me back. It says its a tinted moistureizer, but I get Light to Medium coverage. Which I LOVE. One tube also last me a long time, which is a bonus! Seriously.. I hope this product never goes away.. * I have tried so many tints.  Some were sticky, some were cakey but this was one was perfect.  Just the right amount of coverage which was light to medium but buildable.  And it had the perfect color for my complexion. * Feel like you have no make up on. This foundation goes on so smooth. * Packaging and scent was nice but the product left an orange tint on my face. It was good coverage and it felt nice on my skin, just not for me. Probably best for tanner people * I find this product is too thick. Its too hard to spread and even takes a bit of effort to squeeze it out of the tube. I want my makeup to be speedy and I find myself not enjoying using it because of this. I also think for a tinted moisturizer, it should be thinner."

It works super well with the revolution transparent setting powder, and revolution setting spray. Bronzer powder and contour blend out really well on top, even after setting powder. I don't notice any creasing after using the setting powder. I use ELF grip primer underneath, and ELF camo concealer, both products work very well with this foundation. * I tried this because i had used some of their eyeshadows that worked well for me.   If you have skin that tends to be oily this is probably not a good product for you. * I love this foundation so much.  I love the way it stays on my skin through the day as I work.  I have no complaints. I will keep re buying this product. * Great coverage for dark/age spots, scars, etc.This is my 3rd purchase and definitely won't be my last. * Strong smell but great coverage. Best bang for your buck! I have sensitive skin and she didnt cause any irritation. Lasted all day with a primer and setting spray * I was completely disappointed with this product! It doesn't cover or set well! It also didn't last thru the day! * I bought this afyer reading positive reviews and seeing it on a half price sale…but this is not for dry skin girlies or those of is who have some fine lines. This stuff sticks to dry patches and accentuates fine lines. Yes, ita full coverage…when you try spreading it around its so thick it doesnt want to budge. Using a damp beauty blender works way better than a brush. But sadky, i wont be repurchasing. I will use thos to cover some areas on my cheeks,  ur wont ve a full face foundation for me."

Less coverage than a bb cream lol and needs soooo much powder to keep it on but stays kinda sticky. I hate it lol * Ive been using this for about a year and a half now, and i love it!!! 

I switched when I found out my E.L.F glow was making me break out. Ive had zero problems since then! 

Im not a foundation or full coverage girlie so putting ny consealer ontop of this really does give me the full face make up look, without feeling sooooo heavy. * Juvia skin booster foundation is sheer and gives a nice glow to skin. I'm fair and purchased number 9 to get a little color. I also like the applicator allowing easy use. Best to dab on and blend with fingers. * First off…. The people reviewing this and getting upset about the coverage is ridiculous. Its not a foundation so chill. Its supposed to be sheer. 
As far as the actual product…. If you can get it to behave properly then its beautiful. Unfortunately it does not play well with other products and the applicator leaves streaks that are hard to blend out. I will be returning this for the difficulty purposes only. Almost great! * was darker than i expected * I love all products by Juvia's place except this. * Love love this product"

Including any dry skin and did not cover well at all. I wanted to really like it but it didn't work for me * I love this foundation, its like your own skin but better. * At this price I'm pretty disappointed. Color match was great and does not oxidize, but that's where the pros ended for me. Definitely not full coverage, didn't blend well and shifts/splotchy. If you're an oilslick like me… this is a total waste. Maybe good for dryer skin? Going back to Dior at this price point and won't be purchasing this one again. * This foundation brought out texture and wrinkles I have never seen before. It is not very blend-able, as it takes a lot of manipulation to look somewhat acceptable. This product is very drying and I have oily skin. Not to mention it does not adhere to the skin, it slips and sides off your face throughout the day leaving you patchy. * I finally found my holy grail foundation, I didn't even buy it at Ulta but that's how much I loved it to write a review. It feels like I'm wearing nothing, it matches my skin perfectly which has been a nightmare for years trying to find a good match. * This coverage is a lot more sheer and dewy than I had anticipated. This would be a beautiful foundation for someone with dry, mature skin since it does not crease. The colors are not accurate either. I suggest ordering one to two shades darker. * I need to keep looking. I have a full bottle that I hope to find someone that it works for."

Although I like the sheer and shimmery tint I didn't find it useful enough to keep it. * I love how it goes on. Looks great on my skin. * As a pale girl I NEVER can find foundation that's fair enough.  Not only is this a shade match, but the wear is smooth and pretty- and it's hard to mess up the application.  Sponge/Brush/Fingers.  Also primer/no primer the product goes on well. * Very very easy for applying on skin  love this product * overall, this product is pretty terrible for me at least. very greasy & oily, transfers easily, little to no coverage on my acne & stuck to dry patches. did no justice for me whatsoever."

It feels so nourishing and applies so evenly. It's light yet gives a good medium coverage. A great summertime weight. Not heavy but yet just enough color. Love it. Buy it. Give it a try. I think you'll like it. * This foundation is so perfect for me. It blends perfectly into my skin. It's so easy to apply. I just dab it on with a beauty sponge and I'm done in minutes! 
I love it ❤️ * I'm not sure why my skin reacts to foundation so terribly, but even the luxury brands make me look a little off. I know my undertone and have been able to pinpoint my exact color profile, so it's not that. Foundation usually sits on top of my face, amplifies my fine lines, and makes me look like a hot mess. Age Perfect Tinted Balm is the only foundation that makes me look better, and I wish I knew about it sooner. It's my favorite! * I have what the skincare industry refers to as ""mature ""skin. I am a make junkie and I had many foundations from drugstores and major department stores but as I got older they all made me look cake and settled into lines. I stumbled on this product and I love it. It's my skin only better. It lasts almost all day on my  combination oily dry skin. It is a wonderful product with light medium coverage for mature skin. Will definitely buy again * I've used 3 pots of this now and I'm still somehow surprised by how nice it is. The formula feels like it won't cover much, but it softens the appearance of/seems to fill and even out pores, scars, wrinkles, or any textures--I often get compliments on how smooth my skin looks when I use this. I've gone back and forth between two colors because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the color match is a little difficult. All in all, I keep trying new foundations just to come back to this one and be impressed by it. * I'm a light-medium skin tone that leans towards cool. I got started on this because an influencer raved about it a few yrs. ago. I decided to try it and couldn't had been more thrilled. I use shade fair 20 for reference. In the pot it looks more like a peach shade. It glides on effortlessly and melts into my skin. My dry/mature skin looks healthy. I'm sure I will get tired of this foundation, but for the last 3 yrs. I've been pleased. Only time will tell. * I was very skeptical to try this and was shocked. It is so good. 47 year old combo skin, apply with real techniques dense brush and its better than high end. How is this not more popular?"
145,hourglass,illusion hyaluronic skin tint,pimprod2020463,2575960," * I expected to love this based on reviews I'd seen, but for me, it applied very thick, sat noticeably in pores (an issue I've never had with any other product) and fine lines and didn't do anything it claims to do. I actually found it quite drying. I love HG products and am so glad Ulta is carrying them. I hope they'll carry the newer HG skin tint so I can try that one. * Im 55 and my skin is very dry, this product is moisturizing and never settles in my pores , an excellent alternative to foundation which just sat on my skin, this tinted moisturizer does not do that. I would highly recommend this product- * I have never had so many compliments about my skin since using this tinted moisturizer! It may not be for anyone needing full coverage makeup but someone looking for a glow and slight coverage! * It was very hard to find something for my aging skin that is full coverage, but doesn't settle into lines and look caked on. this was recommended in store and I absolutely love it! I apply with a beauty blender and use shape tape concealer with a tiny bit of setting powder. Really makes a difference being hyaluronic and any pictures while wearing come out great. A must in my drawer. * I wanted to like this. I have dry skin and some creepiness at 52. This made all of that worse.

It's very thick and kinda hard to blend out even with moisturizer and primer. 
I had to return this and buy the Too Faced brand hydrating liquid foundation. * Several comments said this was medium to full coverage which made me want to try it and it is not. There is absolutely no coverage at all. If anything it's just a glorified moisturizer so I'm thinking those other comments were for a different product. * Absolutely one of my favorite foundation. I love how it leaves my skin glowing and hydrated!"

Imagine my surprise the following day when it was available again at full price. Bait and switch advertising...not cool. * The discontinued gold compact was perfectly thin and light weight, making it easy to carry everyday. Also great for touch-ups when mineral foundation SPF is needed out in the sun! The closing latch wasn't super secure but I never had a problem with it opening in my purse. The new design is thick and super heavy. It's beautiful to sit on a counter, but useless weight for travel or carried in a shoulder bag. So sad I never odered backs up of the slim gold-tone compact! * I was surprised how expensive this compact is. But I have had so many contacts break and then I get crumbled pressed powder. This one looks like it will hold up well. I will let you know the first time I drop it-Yikes! * Very happy with this new compact. My JI mineral foundation stores securely,  the compact opens easily and now has a mirror. Yay! * I am a loyal Jane Iredale brand user. In fact, I have been using their products for over 20 years. The Jane Iredale line was recommended to me by the surgeon who did facial reconstruction after skin cancer surgery. 

Although I love their products, I have always been ""ehh"" about their packaging....until now! Thanks for finally giving up the gaudy gold (sorry, Jane Iredale) and going with this new, modern and aesthetically pleasing line of packaging. Since I have several of the old gold compacts, including the gold metals ones, I ordered one of the new compacts to see how I would like it. After receiving the new compact, I cannot wait to replace ALL my older versions! 

One more suggestion... in your future development, please consider making your eye shadows available in refills. I love the idea of being kinder to our planet and saving on the excess packaging. I do not mind paying separately for the cases if I know if is making a smaller, greener impact for future generations. =)

One final note of thanks to Ulta...I have been begging my local store to start carrying Jane Iredale. I am glad to see that you are at least finally carrying this amazing, clean line of makeup online! * I bought this on sale and I'm glad I did. It just makes it nice to put your foundation in. For the price of the foundation, it's a shame you have to purchase compact separately. * This packaging is overpriced and by default should be included with the powder. Waste of money."

Thats where this product shines! It's very hydrating and lightweight so it looks like radiant skin! * I actually love this foundation bc i have blemish free skin and us it to even out hyperpigmentation. The issue is the pump… it does not pull product well after tube is no longer full and it doesn't come off. So its just wasted product. * Of course it doesn't fully cover blemishes, its not full coverage. I buy this again & again & pair it with concealer for under eyes / blemishes , & blush. Its so smooth, never breaks out my acne prone skin. I love it so much!! * Honestly I hate foundation, I have super sensitive skin and anything can break me out easily. This foundation is SO NICE!! It is more like a skin tint than a foundation, which I prefer if I do ever wear it, the smell is relaxing (if you're not an essential oil person I wouldn't recommend, the lavender is pretty strong), and it doesn't feel like anything is on. For my Florida girls this stuff is a great quick fix for the hot and humid days!! * I have super sensitive, rosacea-prone skin & my eyes are really easily irritated by makeup (ocular rosace) that started a few years ago - suddenly I couldn't wear my favorite makeup without breaking out, & my eyes burning, bright red. I searched & finally found a brand specifically for rosacea-prone skin! So happy to be able to wear makeup again! Over the last year or so the formula clearly changed - I couldn't find a color match & then my eyes started to  burn again. Back to the search - finally found this - I love this foundation & the whole product line! It's light & looks great - as others have said, I look like myself, only better! It doesn't settle in my lines or pores, doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It does feel a bit oily / has a bit of shine. Also, Nude 3 is a perfect color match for me when it goes on, but it does darken a bit across the day so I'm going to try 2.5 & save 3 for the summer. Otherwise, highly recommend!! * I bought this foundation and love it.  I'm 47 years old with dry and pigmented skin from aging and I like light coverage products due to aging skin look more natural than full coverage foundation.  Very moisturizing.  I still set with loose powder and yes would buy this as long as nudestix still made this. * I got this product in shades light3 it a good tinted moisturizer with light to medium at most.  Great for dry skin.  Love this product."

After a lot of shaking, it seemed to dispense properly, but the formula is pretty thick. It dries almost instantly and makes blending difficult. I also felt that it emphasized fine lines and wrinkles on my very dry skin. * overall the wear of the foundation wasn't bad, but my skin was red and inflamed when I took it off and I don't typically have sensitive skin and this was the only thing different in my routine * I like this brand and what little of this foundation I put on my face went on smooth and dried well. but it smelled so awful I couldn't use it! I didn't see reviews that mentioned the smell so I'm wondering if I got an old/bad batch…which would also be concerning. Disappointed but returning this * I have a hard time finding foundation due to an olive undertone, with silver being a better jewelry color for me. I purchased the Fair Lady T1N and this just.. it's awesome. It does dry down fast and blending becomes near impossible after, but with my combo skin, this is wonderful. I live in Maine and this foundation doesnt budge in the winter or the summer. One thing I will say is that if you have dry skin, this foundation won't be user-friendly. I typically have oil on my nose and forehead, with a dry chin. I lightly exfoliate my face, apply toner, then follow it up by a light non-cream moisturizer, and that solves the problem. * I was hoping this product would perform close to the Becca foundation that you can no longer get.
It's OK but not a go to foundation. It's more watery in my opinion and coverage has to be worked on quite a bit. 
I am sorry, but for me it's not what I was hoping for. * I dont teally wear foundation but gor aome reaaon wanted to try  this one and it was on sale . I am SO happy with it ! It wasnt heavy and it didnt cake up !  I am beyond happy * I LOVE this, I currently have 9 foundations(yes I counted) that I rotate through and I wish I found this sooner.

The last few compacts I've bought have cracked from barely any use. I had to dump the powder into a different container and use it that way. * so I do a full face every day. every once in a while I'll ""cheat"" and use this product to save time. it works sooo well. I use a light shade which I chose by pretty much matching my neck/highlight areas and use it mainly in my T zone. highlighting under eyes, forehead between brows chin and then I also add it along my jawline. then I go about my routine as normal but without the need for foundation highlight and baking. saves so much time! it builds well and has amazing coverage. it lasts all day. I have mature skin and hate when things settle into fine lines and wrinkles and I do not have that problem with this. it actually makes my skin appear younger compared to my full face routine with baking etc. I know I hav to find a new foundation to help avoid it but who has the time lol anyway... YES. this product is one I want to hoard in case it ever goes away. it's amazing. I use it with a compact dense brush. 

only downside is that I broke 2... but it's because I throw it in my purse and I know that's not ideal and on me for being careless. but if it's getting tossed around, be aware the powder may break. * This is a must have in my kit! I use it to lightly set my foundation and it transforms my face! I have also used it as a powder foundation for summer days and it is flawless! * This is the best powder foundation i have ever tried, i reach for this one over my high end one. Its my go to during the summer months. * Medium to full coverage. I like to carry it in my bag for touch ups because it covers the redness around the nose, i can cover up some my blemishes that peak out after wearing makeup all day etc * I use the shade Natural and I absolutely love this powder. i've used mine all the way to the pan and just restocked a new one. Literally the most beautiful blurring coverage, doesn't feel cakey or drying and my skin looks flawless. Great for on the go and quick touch ups. I usually hate the feeling of wearing heavy foundations and powders so once I found this it was over. Super breathable and comfortable and evens out my skin tone in a couple quick pass overs.

It also looks a bit cakey but i highly recomend spraying do we setting spray onto your brush/sponge, and then blending out. * I normally wear Estee stay matte foundation but I was out and until it arrived I needed something in the meantime. I wore this out, was standing in the parking lot talking to my friends and some random lady walked up to us and said ""sorry to interupt but I just have to tell you, you are stunning"" ( she was talking to me) And then she walked off. I was never told that when I wore the Estee! What the heck, this stuff is GOLD. * I have been using this foundation for 5 years now. I will say it is not full coverage but it is buildable. This foundation feels so lightweight & it gives such a natural look. I've tried other foundations but always come back to this one cause its just so good! I tend to have an oily T-zone & everywhere else is pretty much dry but this foundation doesn't ever really cake or flake on me. I 100% recommend this foundation for an everyday natural look! * I love this foundation! it's affordable and stays on all throughout the work day * this foundation is surprisingly good for the price. it's buildable, smooth, and has a nice matte but natural finish. it flaked on my chin area after a few hours, but that could be my skin type. * Love this for my combo skin. I'm not extremely oily but I needed something that would actually last throughout the day without needing to powder by midday. I actually like it better than the Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear. I am shade 090 in Lancome but have not been able to find a good color match as 090 is too light and the next shades are too dark and orange. I have very fair neutral skin. I prefer how the covergirl looks, it is very smooth with slightly better coverage, and L20 is a great shade and a closer match than the Lancome (maybe L20 is a dash too light but it looks perfect after bronzer). It gives a natural matte finish that doesn't cling or look cakey. Works well on my middle-age skin with fine lines. Has great medium-full coverage. Highly recommend! * I really love this foundation and I will continue to purchase it! Affordable and covers well."

Its not full coverage but percect for the summer needing something lightweight. Shade match was surprising good. I would definitely buy again * Not good. Coverage is pretty bad. Watery. Dont buy * Great product * Great for the price but doesn't stay all day but the shades are great they just need more for other skin tones. * For the price that its sold at, this foundation is amazing! It stays on pretty well, and it doesn't separate on the face like other foundations did. And this was really important for me, because I get super oily skin during the day. It did get a bit shiny though. * My skin is more dry during the winter months! So far so good i love the coverage and the shade was perfect for me. I love how it doesnt dry right away i was able to dot my face with it and then pat it with my foundation brush. The price is also another plus! * Bought wrong shade gave to my daughter inlaw she loves it"

But sooo much disappointed when there is no shade available for me, not even a close shade. * So overall if say its a good product if your a oily skin and combination skin then its pretty good buttt the shade range needs work it goes from a fair skin shade to a tan walnut color so id say maybe add more shadess ! BUT I DO LOVE HOW THEY INCLUDED DEEPER SKIN TONES * This works so well for my skin when I want to beaty ""filter"" my face. But this is noy for dry skin. * It broke the second I tapped my brush on it. Then it was impossible to blend out on my face and ruined my makeup ): * I love this powder this is the best powder that I have discovered as of lately. Elf kills it with all the products they release but this is top tier. * I really wanted to like this product, but even though I moisturize my skin, it leaves randow streaks on my face, as if i applied it with a paint brush. And leaves weird marks on my nose that I cant blend out and have to literally use my nails to scratch off. I have oily skin and never experienced this with a powder foundation. * I have fair skin and got the recommended color. It's too yellow for me and honestly isn't as good as the dermablend camo. I only got it because I can't find the dermablend camo anywhere. This doesn't stay on my skin very well and rubs off so easily."
162,ulta beauty collection,velvet matte longwear foundation,pimprod2020823,2560234," * Tried for the price…but this foundation os awful. Thick & doesnt blend, smells like dry erase markers, & the foundation was seperated in tube. 
Very cakey lookong foundation * I was introduced to this foundation by a friend, and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin; this was the FIRST foundation that stayed matte on me all day. I wouldn't recommend for beginners OR people with dry skin as the foundation is fast drying and you have to work fast when you apply it! But of you are oily, and know what you're doing, HIGHLY recommend! * As I have very severe skin, allergies, this was a recommended product, and I was excited to try it. I did not mind the heavy texture, but the smell was overwhelmingly bad, somewhat smelly of kerosene. I'm very disappointed, great price, good texture. * Very dry and colors are pale and unatural. * This came completely separated. So I tried mixing the best I could inside the tube and when I applied it to my face it's literally impossible to blend into the skin. * This foundation is definitely not for beginners. Its not lightweight, and could be tricky to apply. I'm someone who needs a heavier foundation becasue my face gets super oily, so I've had experiences with thicker foundations. I like to apply it with my fingers, and then blend it in with a damp sponge. It lasts pretty long, especially with a setting powder and is a heavy duty foundation. I wouldn't recommend this product if you have dry or normal skin, but its a pretty good option for skin that needs some oil control, especially for the price. 

The thing I don't like about it is that the colors look too yellow on me (even the lightest shades) and that it starts to make my pores more visible after some time. * I would look like one of those powdered face men from the 1800s if i wore this."
163,kiko milano,full coverage 2-in-1 foundation & concealer,pimprod2020414,2576034," * I love Kiko. I live in Italy and was introduced to this brand by one of my girlfriends.All of their stuff is amazing. This foundation is great but definitely runs a bit warmer than I expected. I'm usually light neutral or 35N and grabbed shade 30N, it was darker than expected and waaaay too yellow on me. * I love this foundation * I was hesitant at first ,because I just heard from this brand but I'm glad i gave it a try. And it was on sale 😁 felt good on my face. I used it and yes it was worth it the staying power  was good specially of your from az. * Have a hard time matching foundation to my skin tone and this matches me perfectly. It looks natural and has buildable coverage. For the price, you cannot beat it, I own foundations double the price and this is now my go to. Give it a shot. :D * I bought this like a month ago and I love it! You dont have to use a lot and literally your face is flawless. One of the things i love about this product is it doesnt dry out your skin. I got the shade neutral 25 and id say that its a mix of fair and tan. I also really love the application part of it, the wand is really nice!!! * Covers a lot without having to apply a ton. Love the application wand * I love this foundation I find myself reaching for it more  often than the others. it's not drying, not greasy,  the coverage looks like my skin but glowy, and not cakey. The kiko Milano powder is awesome too for baking BTW. This foundation is way very similar to TF Born this way foundation, (but not as greasy) kiko milano is underrated IMO. Yes I would recommend."
164,well people,bio stick foundation,pimprod2008575,2553269," * The old formula truly was the best, I looked forward to applying it every morning.  Blended like a dream, gorgeous satin finish, blurred imperfections, clean and fragrance free.  The color 1C was actually a cool tone, this new 1C is PEACH toned....very warm, and the formula change truly makes me sad....it's not the same. They ruined a perfect product. * I absolutely love this product! The smell is a bit strong and the application is a little off-putting, but it blends great and looks great! I found that instead of using a traditional primer like elf power grip, using a setting spray to prime made application easier and blending smoother. * My skin looked worse with this. Highlighying pores no matter how much or how many different methods i use. And shows every bump, dry patch, etc. its so weird. Like the opposite of why we wear makeup in the first place. So mad i was fooled that im writing a review * I have very fair and pink skin and have always had trouble finding foundations that match my tone, never mind work well on my oily/combination skin, but I will say that this one does a good job! I was nervous buying online without match testing, but I got the 1C and would say its a pretty good match for my skin tone. 

My pros for this are definitely: generaly matches my skin, works well with my oily/combination skin, it coming in a stick format is very convenient and mess free, stays on very well, looks natural, and doesnt make my skin feel gross

My cons would be: not the perfect match (wish the undertones were more p and that the shade was slightly lighter), can get a little cakey if i put too much on, and a little hard to blend. 

For context I've been wearing Too Faced Born this way foundation in the shade Snow for years now because it's the only foundation I've found that comes close to matching my skin, but I've always run into the same problem of not being able to apply the foundation too thick because then you can tell it's not a true match. Anyway, I would say overall thi one does a better job, has better ingredients, feels better on my skin, and is a good price point.

My last points would be dont let the 1 star reviews scare you, this foundation is very nice and as long as you use a wet sponge to apply and don't mind the mild scent of castor oil that fades in about 30 minutes :) * The old formula was amazing.  Shade 1C was a perfect cool tone as described.  This newer version is very peach in tone and no longer qualifies as cool toned.  So  if you are a fair, cool toned person...look elsewhere. * I have come back to this product again and again after trying other hydrating foundations that are too thin and messy or settle into pores. This is my favorite non-SPF foundation. It is like a natural version of cover girl compact makeup. It's vegetable oil based so it does smell like olive oil. But it's so nourishing and convenient with the solid stick. It smooths on well to a medium coverage and natural dewy finish that doesn't settle into my pores or cause breakouts for me. And with a light powder to set, it stays all day. I do wish they had lighter shades as the lightest warm (2W) is a bit dark for me in winter. But I'm a repeat customer of this good clean dry skin foundation option. * This brand is awesome and exactly what I was looking for. I live in the desert and ingredients like hyaluronic acid just pull the water out of your skin because there's no water in the air here. It seemed like every make up and skincare brand hopped on that train and I couldn't find anything for my skin (dry) and climate type. I hope they never change the formula! I'm almost 30 and I'm starting to get crows ft etc and this really does a great job of camouflage without settling in any wrinkles."

 There's no Comparison... bring this back * I need this to come back!!! I haven't found anything that i really like. * I bought this product for many years and I always loved it. However since Kat sold the product off its formula has changed for the worse. I've tried the new version and it's awful I've tried fenti, tarte, double wear, and two others they all suck! * Mine always smelled like paint. Super thick, matte and cakey but superior coverage to anything made ever. * Please bring it back!!!! Nothing compares * My favorite and un replaceable foundation. I haven't found a similar to this one not one!!! This is the best foundation for OILY skin and tge coverage amazing. Loved that it last all day mind you i live in Az and the weather is HOT this foundation would not move at all. Pleas eplease being this back because Good Apple is not close at all in coverage and wear. * This was the only matte foundation i found that made my textred mature skin not look more textured and makes me look older like all other matte foundations I've tried! This one looks so amazing. Stayed all day and i sweat alot on my face. I really dont know why they got rid of this foundation. I literally have not one bad thing to say about this foundation. I really hope they bring this back!!!"
169,lorac,pro soft focus longwear foundation,pimprod2013331,2558415," * I don't like to leave bad reviews, but this foundation was a disappointment for me as I love, LOVE their glass primer. First is that it came out very watery. I understand it is buildable but this was really runny. As others have said, it has a faint maple syrup smell - but for me it was maple syrup mixed with chemical. I am also having some kind of skin reaction and irritation since using this. Nothing major, but enough for me to not use it anymore after 2 uses. Lastly it did not last more than 4 hours. It smeared, creased and caked in areas on my face. Luckily I bought this on sale and just gave it to my niece. This might work for others but for me - no. Sadly their foundation does not live up to the quality of their glass primer - which for me is the best primer in all my years. * I was amazed at how full coverage it is! & how it dosent even look like im wearing foundation! I mean wow !! Definetly will be purchasing more! * I never had a Lorac foundation before, but I know the brand revamped so I thought I would give this a try. It did not dissapoint!!! I have roseacea and dry skin, and this worked amazing for coverage. There is a small scent but it's sweet and lowkey reminds my of syrup. Besides that there are no complaints from me. I would highly recommend using the shade finder tool to compare it to your current foundation. I'm an olive skin tone so it's hard to find foundations that are inclusive of that. I got a summer shade and a winter shade because  I love this foundation so much. Highly recommend! * I don't know if this is supposed to be runny as only a few reviews mentioned it but it's basically colored water & it's so messy. I will never buy this again. * This is my new favorite foundation,
! It has excellent coverage with a natural finish. I have dry skin but find a lot of the hydrating foundations transfer and/or leave my skin looking oily by the end of the day, this foundation looks good all day and doesn't transfer. It does have a incredibly potent smell that lingers long after it dries, but I have been able to get used to it and I only notice when during application. * Although I like this foundation in everyway I have to give a low score because it isn't CRUELTY FREE.   There is no good reason for testing on animals and there are plenty of good products available which ARE CRUELTY FREE too. * I purchased this on a whim as i saw it on sale. I received it at the same time another package with the new Prada foundation came in, and I'm shocked that i like the Lorac foundation more than the Prada!  I applied this with my Hourglass foundation brush as the formula is quite thin amd it went on beautifully. Its so smooth and the finish really is a soft matte. It seems to be very long lasting as well. My first favorite foundation of the year."
170,kiko milano,active foundation,pimprod2036981,2607365," * Ok, there are a lot of decent stick foundations out now (not great, but decent).  I don't think this is one of them.  It's the old school sort--the kind that feels very waxy.  If you have dry skin, you will not be pleased.  It's very hard to get the finish to look good, and even harder to get it to stay looking good.  It's probably not going to save you time or make your life easier on the go. * I am blown away by how amazing this stick foundation is!! It gives a barely there feeling which i love. It does not settle into fine lines and stays on all day. Can't wait to try more stuff from the brand!!! * This stick goes on sooo smoothly! Absolutely love the consistency of this makeup! My skin looked like a barely there makeup look, exactly what i was going for. Definitely need to extend the shade range of this makeup but other than that this stuff is amazing!! * great coverage for my skin tone and felt smooth.  please add more skin tones so all people can have it. * this shade range has every type of tone for lighter skin but for 1 dark complexion do better * I honestly dont unserstand why people who've never tried this give it a low rating due to the shade range. This is an Italian owned brand. Majority of the population is olive, light to medium skintones. Many of them/us have a hard time finding our shades. Go try Fenty Beauty if you dont like it. Anyways, this is fantastic. Super blendable and looks smooth on my texture. * the shade range is disgusting. its not like italy is a sheltered country or anything, many POC reside there. darker women, men, and all in between deserve to have products that fit their skin too. do better."
171,maybelline,instant age rewind perfector 4-in-1 whipped matte makeup,pimprod2028923,2590459," * Its like it never dries and doesnt stick to your skin. So skin ends up looking splotchy. Wipes off easily and blends with nothing. Won't purchase again! * I have combination skin, super oily with dry patches. I hate the feeling of foundation so I just prefer something super light to even out my color and mattify me. This stuff is perfect! It feels completely weightless and looks natural. It wears off gradually by the end of the day without looking crazy. Definitely my favorite face makeup! * It wiped off easily didn't  stay on my face. I would use it in a certain spot and i would try and apply it somewhere else and it would wipe off * As for color match, it's perfect. But it doesn't really cover up my imperfections like age spots * Looks great on my skin. * Very light coverage. Feels so light and soft on skin. Not oily after a full day of wear! Doesn't cover blemishes the best but will give a nice even tone over the skin. Blends nicely! * I loved this! Its very light weight. I used under this my normal skin car rountine. And i wear elf glow sunscreen and halo glow with this bb cream and i loved the result. I do use conceler as well. And i dont feel caked on. Honestly try this method."
172,flower beauty,get real serum foundation,pimprod2022967,2577491," * I am someone who likes a no-makeup look, and this is perfect! The product is very hydrating and goes on in a nice thin coat to make you look flawless and like you don't have makeup on. Unsure if it's buildable since I didn't try. Highly recommend! * I absolutely love this foundation! It is even better then the very high end products i have purchased.  Hydrated, natural looking skin is what my aging skin looks like when using it. I cannot believe what an absolute bargain this foundation is. I would gladly pay triple the price. I hope they never stop making it! * Moisturizing and glowy with light coverage, this foundation plays well with powder and cream cheek products on top. It does not layer itself well (looks very textured), however. No other complaints, as long as you like light coverage glow with a single layer of product I'd say you have found the best product in the market in this price range! Also stays preserved well, in case you're soemone that takes a while to go through product. * I LOVED the Light Illusion foundation! Then I tried this. WHAT a letdown. It is runny, thin, has NO coverage. THE COLOR( I wear L2  IVORY in Light Illusion) is also DARKER than LIGHT ILLUSION. The L2 Ivory is the same as the L4 warm beige. * I bought this on a whim on sale because ive heard good things and actually really like other flower products BUT this is was a let down I understand its a ""serum"" fondation and not meant to provide coverage thats fine what I DIDNT LIKE was the fact that i could not get this to stick to my skin it transferred and moved around and good luck trying to apply anything on top of it * I love serum foundations and this one did not disappoint! This one is up there with the more high end serum foundations in every way but without the crazy price tag. It is sheer - exactly what I like! - and blends like a dream. It has staying power and flattering shades. A little goes a long way. It plays well with other products both cream and powder. No moisturizer needed as it is very hydrating - my dry mature skin drinks this up and loves it! Very happy! * I've got combination skin with an oily t-zone and dry on my forehead and underneath my eyes, this doesn't bring any of this texture out! It's light coverage which I like for daily wear and for hot days."

It is so thick it won't pump out. The foundation is clumpy and doesn't spread at all. Why did they change a good product???? * This foundation is worth trying! Creamy, spreads nicely (I use a brush), nice colour matching (I consider myself a medium brown skin colour). Overall great product! * I cannot say enough GOOD THINGS about this CC cream. There comes the point when foundation is out, and CC cream is in, and I am pleased with this product's color choices, smooth texture, and luminescence. I mix two shades and apply the first color as a primer. This CC cream doubles as my concealer; it's that easy to apply. * This product: separates BADLY and doe not blend well at all; Smells weird and chemical-y; offers VERY little coverage, even for a CC cream, and is overpriced because of all these factors. Positives: it makes skin glowy and has SPF. I wouldn't buy this personally - Pacifica's skincare and fragrance are AMAZING, but makeup seems to be a weak point. * This product came out separated. Tried shaking product to get product mixed together and it came out somewhat like foundation. Does not go on skin nicely. Do not recommend. * it comes out as a clear oil with little specs of color that don't blend."

This breathable, light satin finish can be set up on itself until youve found your inner teenage beauty queen! It's perfect for my skin type & it smells lovely too. A+ Ulta! * I love this lightweight easy to apply buildable foundation.

Please please PLEASE bring back some of the lighter colors. * I bought this over the holidays and LOVED it!! Goes on easily and is weightless. Soooo disappointed to see that my shade is not available. Please do not discontinue this product. * My perfect shade is Light to Medium Cool.  Not available the last 2 times I've tried to buy.

I was not expecting to fall in love with this product, but it's truly flawless. I have NEVER had a shade match me so accurately. This product is buildable and can be worn for 100% full coverage or as a tint. The color is pigmented enough to cover dark undereye without concealer for a very natural ""no makeup"" finish. The price is a steal lol * I have never had a more perfect color match in my entire life. I show this to the older women in my family and you would think I was literally doing a magic trick lol shock awe and wonder. I often and loudly recommend this in True Caramel. Perfect for lace on wigs or just on skin * The foundation is very smooth and moisturizing.  It provides medium coverage, so I build it by applying several applications to get a more full coverage.  It is a great product for the price. * I have purchased this product before and I liked it. This time the product was used. It had a finger smudge print on it when l opened it and the sponge applicator had make all on one side. I ended up purchasing something else at another store. * First, note this has the ingredients that Danessa Myricks uses for her foundation at an affordable cost. This provides a great shade match, makes skin look healthy and even, easy to take with you and stays on even if you sweat. The magnesium carbonate in the formula absolutely is wonderful for sweaty moments. I just find you can't really apply it with anything other than a sponge. Brushes with dense round tops don't pick it up well, as nothing else does. If you don't want to buy a beauty sponge you'll be fine to use the one it comes with. * Great shade for Hispanic women."

This foundation might not be for everyone but I do like it! * After researching this brand, I was extremely excited to try this foundation. When I first applied it the shade took my breath away! However, throughout the day it would smear and wipe off so easily :( * The consistency of the foundation is wonderful. It's super light and just melts into the skin. The color range is also phenomenal. I've never found a shade that matched me so perfectly. It literally looks like my skin. All of my friends, family members, and coworkers inquire about the foundation I use, and I have to share the link often. * Great foundation for the price. And it has spf! * Matched me perfectly.

(for shade match reference: i also use loreal tinted serum shade 4-5 and the maybelline super stay skin tint in shade 220 & have oily skin) ANYWAYS YALL TRY THIS OUT ITS SO GOOD AND PLEASE NEVER GET RID OF THIS PRODUCT I LITERALLY BEG U GIRL!!! * i wanted something less full coverage, as it would crease in my smile lines, ans this does the trick! its a beautiful finish and lasts my full work shifts! no creasing either!!! * Why would the name be tinted foundation? Isnt all foundation tinted""? Maybe try tinted moisturizer * Light and hydrating product that evens out dull skin without looking heavy! Great for looking put together on minimal makeup days. * The coverage of this bad boy is wat too light to be called a foundation, but it doesnt have any skin care benefits which is I guess why they can't call it BB cream. It's refreshing to have a product with light coverage and a natural finish instead of dewy. Great for no makeup makeup days. * I found the Tawny shade of L.A. Girl Tinted Foundation in my local Ulta's clearance section and figured I'd give it a try. When I got home, I used Ulta's shade matcher and it told me I was really Warm Sand in this product (based off entering Ginger for bareMineral's COMPLEXION RESCUE Tinted Moisturizer Mineral SPF 30). Warm Sand perfectly matches my skin right now during the winter. I'll try Tawny again in the spring/summer, but it was a close match too. I love how lightweight this product feels and how easy it is to apply — I dot it on right from the tube and the dab/blend with a lightly moist makeup sponge. It looks just slightly dewy but doesn't feel overly wet or sticky. It also works well under my bareMinerals BAREPRO 16HR Skin-Perfecting Powder Foundation if I want to look more made up, but between the price and its natural look when used solo, it fits well with my minimalist approach to makeup. * I am 66 years old. It settled into my wrinkles and emphasized them.  Very sheer coverage. Not a good choice for me."
179,well people,bio powder foundation,pimprod2008579,2553264," * Light, sheer. Shade range is confusing. If unsure, go a bit darker than normal. * I ordered 2W - Warm light - and it was almost white, so light and clearly defective. It did absolutely nothing other than make me have a Casper look. It is so sheer I can't imagine it doing anything even if it was the correct color.  I contacted Well People, I thought they should know how bad the product was, and they didn't care. * W3ll people... we need to talk about the shade range. People with darker skin tones like makeup too yet the shade range completely excludes anyone beyond tan. Thankfully the darkest shade works for me so I enjoy the product but it's hard to get behind a brand that doesn't give darker skintones a thought. * I was really hoping this product would work for me but it didn't. I found the baked foundation to be much more drying than other pressed powders I've previously used. Felt like it didn't go on well and had horrible coverage. Will not be buying again. * Takes forever to build up. Not for anyone who wants medium to full coverage. Light to medium at best. * Honestly if you're looking for a foundation to take a chance on.. this is definitely it. I'm not sure why I even chose to buy this but I love it!! I use it over concealer and it evens out my skin tone perfectly. Also does not make me look too orangey or cakey. * Just meh"

I love the shade range for brown tones. * I use this all the time! I do recommend this. * this product is horrible. it doesn't blend at all and it's extremely patchy and cakes on easily. there are cheaper foundations that are better than this!

183,mented cosmetics,skin by mented foundation,pimprod2022002,2578536," * I saw mented today and bought m10, d10, t30(like 2 of each) I did this with complexion changes and such in mind. It was so easy to apply, felt nice on my skin, looks natural and I think m10 is my shade - it is spot on (for my beautiful summer complexion ) I'm excited to have found Mented! not a con for me, because i don't choose a makeup to smell good, but definitely seems like fragrance wasn't added.

I have pretty dry sky so I know to add a moisturizer before applying this. I am not saying this drying…but makeup ondry skin can appear patchy * This product feels and looks like you have no product on. * I have searched for the perfect match years! So excited to have finally found a shade so spot on with my skin tone that it's almost scary. The stick foundation is easy to apply, blends well and leaves me a great natural glow. * Looked awful on me. Horrible on oily skin and def dont get if you have light skin. This foundation isnt made for light skin tones which sucks. * Perfect match almost feels like a tinted moisturizer. I'm oily so I still need a powder but for stick makeup it goes on smooth and doesn't run off. I'm sold * Okay so hear me out.. the color match to my skin is amazing!!! it blended beautifully. However, I have combo oily skin and nothing could have prepared me for how shiny and oily this foundation is. This is not a matte foundation so beware!! * Hidden Gem hands down. I have been looking for a good foundation in general for a few years now, I went high end low end drugstore I went tinted moisturizer to full coverage and non did what I actually wanted. I love make up but finding a good foundation for my oily skin that wont force me to re touch (which I'm horrible at by the way, always makes it worse) was close to impossible without making me feel like I have pounds of make up on especially for work. I had tried the Hourglass foundation stick which was highly rated and felt very chalky on my skin. I did a search of stick foundations and came across this one. I am the lightest shade in this line and am on my way to re up for a 3rd time! I have never purchased 1 item more than once since they end up not working out for a while. The coverage is amazing from one layer to a 2 layers if I want a fuller look. It glides on like butter on my skin  and gives me a glow without an oily look if that makes sense. I rarely have to completely set my face because it sets so nice on its own and will literally last me over 9 hours without any cracks or separation and looks like I just applied it minutes ago. It makes my face feel hydrated and not like I'm wearing loads of make up. This is a long review and I never leave a review but I am truly in love with this foundation! I am so thankful for this brand because I am the in between when it comes to make up, I'm a semy fare complexion with neutral undertones. Many lines have a Yellow undertone or an olive undertone which makes me look washed out. This is truly a bang for your buck and will leave your make up looking flawless."

185,mac,studio radiance face and body radiant sheer foundation,pimprod2023387,2579193," * wow. I can go on about this foundation forever. I have very pale, dry skin, this shade range cancels out any issues ive had with light foundations that are too orange, does not stick to or emphasize when i have dryness. I 100% recommend this product. * This doesn't settle in wrinkles like a lot of foundation.  It is a bit hard to use to start with but once you figure it out it's very nice.  Good for older and younger skin.  I'm 64 and it's the best I've ever used. * This foundation is perfect for evening out skin tone without making it look like you painted your make up on. I really love pairing it with cream contour and cream blush, and then just setting it with a setting spray- it gives a gorgeous dewy finish. You can set it with powder to make it a little more long lasting too. I always try to catch it on sale. I think having a gorgeous light coverage foundation like this is perfect for an interview, meeting someone new, or embracing your natural beauty! Its made me feel so much more confident in my own skin. * The origin to my villain story. I listened to an ULTA employee, first foundation for my high school homecoming. Three days later I broke out, having clear skin all my life. Ever since, it never stopped. I had to go on meds to cure my acne. Don't use. * I used to use the old face and body without the radiance and always loved it so im not surprised I love the new version especially because I like more of a sheen/glow to my skin. This is a very sheer coverage foundation but is buildable if you want a little more coverage. Also I can apply this over my skincare without it pilling! * I never tried the original face and body. Honestly, I was never interested in this foundation until I started watching Miss Megan Robinson on tik tok. Seriously you NEED to follow her!! I generally have oily skin. It's been a lot more calm, and a lot less oily after I got rid of all the actives, and JUST started washing, toning, and using AN OIL (I know right, but it's true, oil loves oil, using an oil will keep your skin from producing a lot of oil) I can now wear this foundation confidently, and it is BEAUTIFUL!! It's friction activated so I suggest applying with fingers and rubbing it in so you can start to feel the ""gripping and thickening"" action that happens with this foundation(which is the best most fun part for me). The coverage is obviously light but it looks like perfected skin. Only the best things are peeking through. Everything blends nicely on top, and I mean EVERYTHING, from all different brands. It wears great too and looks even better as the day goes on. Its softly radiant and skin like if you powder (which I still do) and if you don't you'll look like a freshly hot glazed donut (some people like that, some people don't) I get the hype of this foundation and dare I say it's made it into my top 5 line up!!?? Coming from an oily girl that is shocking. If you're wondering, I use the Danessa Myricks yummy skin balm in translucent as a primer, this foundation, all my other creams and liquids, and I set with Mac studio fix powder and one size setting spray. PERFECTED NATURAL RADIANT SKIN * Wear it everyday and have received unprovoked complements."
186,vdl,perfect lasting foundation,pimprod2006000,2560248," * I LOVE this foundation! It's definitely full coverage. It look so beautiful like natural skin! It doesn't dry matte, so definitely set it with powder. I'd say a little goes a long way! It last all day & still look beautiful even after a workout. The only areas that would slightly crease would be around my smile lines & chin but nothing crazy. I wish the foundation would be more available but it's so hard to find & the shade range isn't the best but overall 10/10 I would recommend! My closest shade is A05.5. I also tried mixing V05 & V04 to get my shade if anyone is wondering. I hope this helps.  :) * Coming from an Ulta Employee, after trying every foundation under the sun, this foundation makes my skin look FLAWLESS, airbrushed, smooth. I do have to set with a translucent loose powder because it is still a little tacky in my opinion. Shades are FANTASTIC. A02 matches me the closest; however if there was a slightly paler shade with a yellow undertone that would be my perfect match. I ordered A01 and A02 on YesStyle and to me 1 was almost darker than 2, but it may just be the undertones. ULTA PLEASE BRING THIS BACK. It took me over a week with express shipping on YS btw I paid $19 extra FYI In case anyone was going to order it, I think it ships from China. Idk what is in this foundation but  I want to buy every bottle just incase it ever gets discontinued😅😭😭😭 * My relationship with foundation is a nightmare,I'm a brown skin girl with golden undertones in the summer and pale skin in the winter,without much prep this foundation matched me perfectly and stayed on ALL NIGHT,the a night of dancing 💕LOVE THIS STUFF * Please restock ASAP! This is my favorite foundation!! I literally bought 3 bottles because I have a feeling Ulta might discontinue this foundation...
 FYI- you can still find VDL on Yesstyle BUT it's NOT the same foundation. The one on Yesstyle has SPF & it has more of a dewy finish 😩 * I hope Ulta is not going to stop selling this foundation. It is an amazing satin finish foundation. Looks flawless on the skin and makes blemished skin look smooth. Wears beautifully throughout the day and is full coverage. Highly recommend. FYI if they stop selling it at Ulta you can find it on YesStyle. * I bought this foundation in the color A06. I tend to have a hard time finding foundations because I am in the weird shade range where I'm typically between medium/tan and dark/deep in various brands. I have Neutral slightly golden/olive undertones and find that many brands get close but not perfectly my shade. Most times foundations are too golden (almost orange looking), too cool, exactly neutral when I need just a touch of yellow in the foundation, or they just skip my shade altogether. I was pleasantly surprised when this foundation was an exact match. I love the natural finish to this foundation. I have dehydrated combo skin that if not properly hydrated will get oily in the t-zone (mostly nose area) and will remain normal or slightly dry everywhere else. When I wear this for several hours my foundation goes from very natural to radiant but not oily as my t-zone starts to break into a bit of a shine. I really don't have anything bad to say about this foundation except because of the limited shade range there's a chance you may not find a good match depending on your skin tone and undertone. Hopefully Ulta continues to keep this foundation available. * I would describe this foundation on my skin as full coverage with a satin/slight dewy finish. I have acne prone skin with acne scars and this foundation covers everything without causing any texture. Long wearing and mask proof. Doesn't cause breakouts. Would recommend for various skin types."
187,l'orÃ©al,age perfect creamy powder foundation,pimprod2021675,2569747," * Very light, silky powder texture. The ""creamy"" title is very deceiving though. It's powder. And quite drying immediately on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this for aging skin whatsoever. Great product for on the go touch ups on oily skin. * I don't care for the sponge applicator because it really doesn't go on right, but I found that using a brush to apply is so much better and it goes on more evenly.  You can add more where needed without it looking blotchy.  I love it! Used the color Sienna * Goes smooth and cover some imperfections, but looks natural. Leaves your skin soft and beautiful. * Lightest shade, Ivory.  You MUST prep the skin with moisturizer, sunscreen and either CT Hollywood Flawless Filter or the Maybeline knockoff or a dewy primer or sunscreen.  Buff in with a brush after applying concealer where needed.  Use powder bronzer, blush and highlight and a setting spray.  It looked amazing on my 48 year old dry skin and lasted all day.  Not powdery, didn't settle in lines, let's your skin peek through (is light coverage).   I really love it. * I thought since it's called age perfect it would be a moisturizing creamy powder. Nope. It's super drying and I have combination oily skin not even dry. Feels horrible right on application You can feel the makeup. Didn't blur anything. I had to take it off within 10 mins of application. Don't buy this stuff. * I wanted to try a cream to powder foundation to try to cover some dark spots. 
This covered what I wanted. It does look a little dry after application but I'm oily so it looks more natural after a few hours. * I love the age rewind concealer and seen this after looking for a good powder foundation. it is a really creamy, finely milled powder. I don't think it's really pigmented but you get enough coverage to even everything out and in my opinion it really does blur. I use a flat top Kabuki brush to buff it in, slowly building up layers. I take product and tap it in where I need more coverage with a concealer brush. I find I get the most coverage this way. it's like your skin but better. gives you a nice natural finish and doesn't look cakey if you slowly buff and build. will be trying this as a setting powder for liquid since it blurs. it also doesn't make me breakout!"
188,hynt beauty,encore pressed powder foundation,pimprod2014352,2564466," * I was so excited to try this powder because of all of the positive reviews. Unfortunately, This product didn't work for my dry skin. And for the price I doesn't have great coverage. I don't see this product any different from any other pressed powder. Also, this powder has sparkles in it I guess to conceal how drying and powdery it makes the skin.. * I love this powder, my skin is dry but this powder always feels comfortable on, never adds any texture as other powders have for me in the past, def one of my fav powders * I LOVE this pressed powder! It takes away the look of shine and makes my skin look refined and even toned. I bought Ivory and it is the ideal shade for my skin tone, medium fair with pink undertones. It works well worn over concealer and foundation, or on its own. And, better still, it looks invisible and feels like nothing on skin! The mirrored compact is the perfect size for taking on the go and it even comes with an applicator sponge on a clear, hinged divider inside. Hynt thought of everything with this pressed powder! I will definitely buy again:) * I've always been reluctant to wear powder - most of the time I end up looking cake-y. This finishing powder is a game changer - so easy to apply and bonus, the packaging is so adorable! But more importantly my skin looks so velvety and super plump, definitely will be coming back for more when I'm through with this! * Love using this powder in-between zoom meetings to touch up my skin. Just gives me a more even/finished and natural look * One of my favorite products from Hynt * I used this foundation with the foam puff it came packaged with. Do not use with a brush, the powder is finely milled and will fall off your brush! I wore it over serum and moisturizer. My face got a little shiny throughout the day but that is common for me, as I have combination skin. I like that the coverage is buildable, I was able to apply two layers and achieved the coverage I was looking for. Best of all, the ingredients are natural and truly clean! No SLS, no parabens, no Lauryl Lysine, no Bismuth oxychloride! So happy Ulta is carrying this brand!"
189,hourglass,vanish seamless finish liquid foundation,pimprod2020422,2575785," * For a pro makeup artist, ( yes, you need to be a pro to know how to work with it) this is so far one of the best foundations that I have ever worked with. I recommend performing a gentle face exfolation before bed time and removing any peach fuzz for any makeup aplication, not just this foundation. It makes a huge difference in aplication and appearance of the final look/finish.
It works best with the Vanish smoothing primer. (To smooth down the pores that every human being has) It is runny but extreamly pigmented. Do not use too much or it will look cakey.Best apply with a dense buffer brush (Morphe 444 is my favorite) and then press it in with a beauty blender. I use the professional Kryolan setting spray first, and then set it with a good powder.( Jeffree Star, Fenty or Kryolan powder) It holds for 14h even in humid Florida. Best foundation for events. It's best for normal/ combination skin. I wish they had more shades.
Unfortunately it just has been discontinued, tho the company has gave me insites that they are working on perfecting the formula and making a new foundation for combination/oily skin (they currently carry luminous foundations for normal/dry skin) * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * It's runny and oily the color that matches to your so called already color foundation your wearing is 19x darker * This product is so thin & runny! Like water consistency. I pumped one pump on my hand & it literally dripped off me. I shook the bottle so many times & it still remained runny. I gave it a try on my face because I wanted to give the foundation a chance but the product just settled right into any crevice it could. I could literally see wrinkles/lines I didn't even know I had. * I got this during a sale and was so excited to try my first Hourglass product. I followed the instructions and reviews and only used a very little amount. It brings out my pores horribly, dries down very weird and makes my skin dry, and even though it feels light on my skin my skin feels a tiny bit sticky, not something I usually experience with prestige brand foundations. This is a miss for me. * This foundation is very reminiscent of Marc Jacob's 'Remarcable' . Full coverage and matte with a pore filling matte primer underneath . The bad reviews are really just people who don't know how to apply makeup . * Words do not explain how buttery this foundation is I have dry to normal skin and it blends it two to three glides. Will never use another foundation"
190,smashbox,studio skin 24 hour full coverage waterproof foundation,pimprod2009758,2552423," * Luckily I night this on a good sale a ways back but it is just not it. I have combo oily skin and so far regardless of the primer or moisturizer this just doesn't look good and will break down. I've been using juvias place which I like ten times better and I don't have to try to make it work. This foundation also oxidizes orange..so not just a shade but it'll turn more orange as well. I'm gonna try to find something to mjx it with but I won't be purchasing again and wouldn't recommend it. * I have oily combo skin, and this foundation did not stand the test of time. It felt very heavy, and transferred with the slightest touch (with setting powder). Only a few hours in, and it was breaking apart on my face, highlighting even the slightest texture. My pores were literally drinking this product up. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a foundation, and could not wait to take it off. * I have combo skin, I use the Bobby brown moisturizer primer underneath and only use a tiny bit with a brush. Looks flawless!! Do not use to much product otherwise it will look cakey, if you need extra coverage apply only to specific area with smaller brush. * 32f (no active breakout/indented scars only on cheeks/combination skin)This foundation has the worst formula I have ever used on my skin. I tried two different primers underneath and tried it on it's own and it just refused to settle or smooth out. It creases badly and makes skin look dry and caked with very minimal use of the product that looked worse and worse if you tried to use even a tiny bit more. Powders and setting spray do nothing to help. I tried beauty blenders and brushes and neither made it better. I ended up going back to a trusty Revlon foundation that was way cheaper and a much better formula. Do not waste your money if you do not have perfect smooth skin. * I have sensitive skin with large amounts of rosacea and occasional eczema. This product covers my redness very well, and can many my dry areas seemingly disappear. Smashbox was also a line that came up multiple times during my search for products best for sensitive skin. * Maybe this just doesn't work with some skin types. I've given this several goes with different amounts of product and application techniques and it always manages to cake up and accentuate every pore after it's settled. I decided to give this one more go, applying after a glowy moisturizer that managed to save some of my other cakey products and it still had the same issues after setting for about 20 minutes. * It has perfect coverage,  a very little goes a long way.  Love the Matt finish I got.  Like  all foundations,  you have to prepare your skin before you applying anything to it.  Use a brush to apply.  I patted it on."
